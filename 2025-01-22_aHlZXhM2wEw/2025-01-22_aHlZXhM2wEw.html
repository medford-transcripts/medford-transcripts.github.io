    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=231.782s">Governance</a>  Committee, January 22nd, 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=235.525s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, can you please call the roll?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=238.488s">President</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=239.409s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=240.229s">Vice</a>  President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=246.975s">I</a>  see Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=248.236s">I'm</a>  gonna mark her as present because I can see her. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=253.921s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=257.404s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=258.044s">Present.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=259.223s">chair</a>  say present five present non absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=262.905s">The</a>  meeting is called to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=265.046s">Today</a>  we'll be discussing resolution <a href="../resolutions/24-468.pdf"><font color="green">24-468</font></a> resolution to discuss updates to the city charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=272.91s">This</a>  is one of three scheduled substantive charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=277.812s">charter</a>  review meetings where we will review the recommendations sent to us by the mayor's office of the work that the Charter Study Committee has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=286.8s">I</a>  know the chair of the Charter Study Committee is in the audience with us today. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=290.503s">I</a>  did send out an official invite to this meeting through the CSC email address. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=299.471s">I</a>  was thinking, because we have so much to work through, and just to remind folks at home, what we have to talk about today is the preamble, article one, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=310.749s">discussing</a>  incorporation, short title definitions, article two about the legislative branch, and article nine, general provisions, section 9-6, which concerns itself with ordinances and the legislative branch as well, which is why it's in this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=328.014s">Because</a>  there's so much to review and talk about today, I was thinking that we could cover the sections in order in the city charter draft that was sent to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=341.198s">and</a>  take composition and compensation at the end, because those, I expect, will be very substantive discussions with a lot of input and discussion required. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=352.962s">And</a>  I don't want the small but very important things to get lost in the substance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=360.724s">With</a>  that being said, do councillors have any opening thoughts or thoughts on the preamble or article one of the draft city charter? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=373.835s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=375.637s">Let</a>  me make sure I can see. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=392.151s">I</a>  should also note that we have representatives from the Collins Center today in the audience with us, too, to work through substance questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=416.465s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=417.125s">President</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=419.767s">Sorry,</a>  I missed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=422.368s">Thank</a>  you chair saying, um, I want to, uh, thank my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=427.951s">Thank</a>  you for putting together these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=429.512s">Thank</a>  the members of the charter study committee, the mayor and the Collins center for their work up to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=435.955s">Um,</a>  and especially for those who are here tonight, as well as member of the public members of the public who are interested in this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=443.298s">Um,</a>  we are, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=445.987s">And</a>  I think I've said this a few times now, we're working on all three of the big three that Councilor Knight once told me the city council is responsible for this term. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=457.351s">We've</a>  passed a budget ordinance and a budget, and we have another budget coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=462.932s">Obviously</a>  we are in, I think meeting 18 or 19 of the term of the planning and permitting committee regarding zoning updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=471.075s">And</a>  we are here tonight on the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=475.064s">which</a>  is the foundational document for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=478.786s">And</a>  we are looking at the first update in nearly 40 years and bringing us into, I would say, the modern age of city charters based on what we're looking at here and before us with the proposal from the Charter Study Committee revised by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=497.858s">And</a>  by and large, I think this proposal is a really great proposal, a charter that the people can understand and something that I wholeheartedly support as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=511.758s">Last</a>  week I submitted to the council and shared with the public very openly a series of amendments that I would like to propose for discussion tonight by this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=522.786s">And</a>  I am hopeful for the consideration and moving forward on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=528.251s">But</a>  I also just want to note that part of the reason that I went about this the way that I did is that there have been fantastic discussions <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=539.041s">from</a>  multiple people all over the Internet talking about what they would like to see, what they wouldn't like to see, bringing forward new ideas that have added to my knowledge base and that I am going to bring to the discussions that we have tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=557.372s">As</a>  regards to the first article and the sections within it, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=563.587s">I</a>  want to thank the study committee for putting together a thoughtful preamble. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=568.81s">I</a>  really think it represents what our community is, as well as its rich history, as it says right in here, our city's rich history and where we want to go and what the purpose of a charter is. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=582.097s">As</a>  regards to the rest of the article one and sections, I did have a couple of minor proposals around the definitions, but they do relate to <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=594.542s">the</a>  proposal around the composition of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=596.825s">So</a>  I will not make any motions or discuss them at this time, but we'll discuss them when that topic comes up for the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=605.093s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=608.536s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro is next in the queue.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=611.787s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=612.888s">I</a>  just want to acknowledge that from the perspective of one of my previous modes of employment was writing and having a really solid draft that is so foundational and so well-written and well-studied and has so much work that's put into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=637.009s">I'm</a>  so grateful to have this to start <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=640.562s">with</a>  and so grateful to the committee and all of the work that they've put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=645.963s">I</a>  agree that the preamble is really lovely. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=648.624s">The</a>  first article, I don't have anything that I would want to edit, but I just really appreciate everything that we have to start with. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=657.146s">I</a>  have a lot of things that I'd like to say later on tonight, but there's, I just, it's so much easier to start <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=668.487s">doing</a>  further work when you have something that's really good to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=676.632s">And</a>  I just want to say thank you to the Charter Study Committee for that grueling work, all of that research, all of those conversations with the public, and all of the work that they did at the Collins Center, and express my gratitude for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=691.561s">So</a>  thank you all very much.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=697.204s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=699.595s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=700.596s">I</a>  first want to acknowledge the fact that as one councilor, I was, when I first started my journey as a city councilor, I was firmly behind the charter change charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=712.965s">And</a>  as we started moving forward and we started seeing some of the changes and what it can impact, my biggest <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=719.925s">The</a>  piece that really turned me around to vote against the charter review at the time was really looking at ward representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=727.792s">And</a>  I think it's because of working in a community that has ward representation and really having some situations where you saw <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=739.04s">the</a>  input of ward representation being looked at in some cases as special interests from section of the city to section of the city, but not what's best for the whole community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=750.043s">So</a>  I found myself being very stubborn and stuck on my beliefs. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=755.644s">And</a>  what I think I needed to do was take a step back. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=759.065s">And</a>  I know that reading all the information that Mr. McDonald's team has done with the charter review and talking to <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=767.884s">Mr.</a>  Jovino and different members of the committee and then reaching out to different colleagues from neighboring communities that have ward representation and truly understanding the positive impacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=780.908s">And</a>  I think that I was so narrow-minded, my thinking at the time was so narrow-minded that I really need to expand and really look at the greater picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=789.47s">And</a>  as I see this presentation, I realized that <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=795.255s">You</a>  know, if I could turn the clock back and if I could have helped by moving this forward back a few years ago when the commitment for the council was needed, I think I would do that today. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=808.685s">But</a>  what I see in place is so impressive in the fact that we have people that were committed <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=816.321s">that</a>  reached out to probably one of the greatest support teams with the Collins Center and someone who I respect in the world of municipalities, former alderman in Melrose and former city solicitor Frank Wright and listening and answering, listening to how he's answering the questions and his team and I think that this is a great <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=838.65s">great</a>  situation right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=840.552s">I</a>  love what we have, what we've crafted. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=843.134s">I</a>  have some reservations as well, but I know my colleagues have shared some, and I think that the biggest takeaway from this is I'm a huge advocate now for 11 councils. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=856.925s">I'm</a>  a huge advocate for ward representation for all eight wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=862.009s">You</a>  realize as I talk to <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=864.503s">as</a>  I talk to people, even in the city of Medford, and we talk about getting people involved in the election process. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=870.727s">And</a>  as I sit with marginalized people and they say, George, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=873.729s">It's</a>  easy for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=875.13s">You</a>  have a base. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=876.571s">So</a>  when you run at large, it's easy for you to raise $20,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=879.973s">It's</a>  easy for you to say you represent everybody, because I think I've done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=884.636s">I</a>  wouldn't ever take away that I represented everybody in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=889.079s">And</a>  if I ever ran, if it was the time that I ran, I probably would run at large just for the fact that I enjoy <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=894.428s">the</a>  whole community, that whole battle. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=897.15s">But</a>  talking to my fellow colleagues in neighboring communities, you understand how important it is for mostly marginalized people that have been underrepresented. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=906.955s">And</a>  right now there's a battle going on in another room talking about zoning reform at Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=913.198s">And</a>  as a person who grew up off of Salem Street, my former neighbors have called me and said, George, why wouldn't you want ward representation with every ward considering <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=924.337s">Shame</a>  on you, because we didn't hear from you at Salem Street when it came to the ward. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=928.699s">We</a>  felt like we weren't listened to. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=930.9s">And</a>  this is why now it's a battle with the Salem Street zoning situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=935.282s">And</a>  we're seeing that in pockets all over the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=938.083s">What</a>  we're seeing at Tufts University with the 10-story building, how it's affecting that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=942.625s">And</a>  I've talked to friends and neighbors there at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=944.326s">George.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=944.606s">Here</a>  we go again. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=945.747s">The</a>  charter review is important because if we had a representative that we can go into in our own backyard that we see every day at the coffee shop, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=953.785s">then</a>  it wouldn't, the information wouldn't have been getting out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=956.767s">And</a>  one of the biggest things I've had, the negative pieces I've had is a lack of information that's going out to the community because the lack of a written newspaper, the lack of true communication across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=968.293s">And</a>  one piece that I found that made me feel secure in my process as I go forward with this is the thought process saying, you know what, we might not have a newspaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=979.277s">but</a>  everybody in every small pocket of our community now will have someone that they feel like they can call. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=985.262s">And</a>  so there are so many things I've learned, and like, again, I'm a big boy now, and I've learned a lot, good and bad, and I wish I could turn back the clock on some of the decisions I made, but when I see the information that's in front of us, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1003.417s">I'm</a>  really excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1004.539s">I'm</a>  really excited and I commend all of you for all the hard work that you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1008.605s">And</a>  again, if you've ever felt that I was an enemy to the cause, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1018.956s">I</a>  don't think I was educated. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1020.116s">I</a>  didn't educate myself to the cost because I was stubborn. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1022.597s">So</a>  what I see in front of me right now, I can't wait to get this through. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1027.478s">I</a>  can't wait to get this to the legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1029.178s">I</a>  can't wait to come back so we can get this on the ballot and see all these great changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1034.639s">And</a>  I think we see a lot of things that aren't working in Medford and the divide in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1040.301s">A</a>  lot of it's because we haven't done this, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1046.482s">you're</a>  seeing how important word representation is across the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1050.624s">And</a>  it's time to, like I said to, my wife and I were talking, I said, Jesus, Dina, she says, it's time for me to grow up and put my big boy pants on and say, hey, listen, this is a great proposal and let's do everything we can to move it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1064.909s">So</a>  again, I commend your charter review team and our friends from the Collins Center, they've done so much work. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1074.771s">are</a>  the actual experts in this field. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1078.834s">And</a>  I think guided this platform to a very robust discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1084.199s">And</a>  again, so I could talk a buzzard off a meat wagon. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1088.162s">So</a>  I just thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1089.143s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1094.877s">I</a>  see President Bears has requested, but I wanted to make sure other city councilors had a chance to give comments first. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1104.668s">Just</a>  to clarify, we're talking about the preamble and article one. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1108.492s">Okay,</a>  I see none. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1112.456s">President</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1114.229s">I</a>  just wanted to also, I was remiss to not thank the Collins Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1117.41s">They</a>  worked up a great comparison document that we received the other, I think yesterday or the day before, comparing what's in the current charter to the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1126.412s">So</a>  I just wanted to thank the team at the Collins Center for putting that together. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1129.513s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1130.353s">Yes,</a>  thank you so much for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1131.674s">That</a>  was very, very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1134.795s">With</a>  Article 1, I did actually have one question about, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1140.347s">a</a>  definition. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1141.148s">I</a>  don't know if Chair McDonald or Collin Center, this is something you guys can help answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1146.875s">I</a>  see that there's a definition here for local newspaper when you control F through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1151.261s">There's</a>  some references to local newspapers, some references to local news publications. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1157.308s">Um,</a>  I know substantively a lot of that shows up later on and like in subjects will cover in future meetings, but seeing that they're going to be spread through two different meetings, I was, I'd be remiss not to ask if that is some language that we should align through the charter document local newspaper versus local news publication. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1179.301s">And</a>  in the definition itself for local newspaper it talks about newspapers with daily or weekly circulation and given the state of local news media. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1189.868s">I</a>  didn't know whether <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1193.828s">requiring</a>  that is something that would eventually hold us up if local news sources were to disappear. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1201.632s">I</a>  know there are folks at home, folks in the city working on creating local news sources, but I know those are still just in the works. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1225.952s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1228.897s">And</a>  if you can, could you give us your name and address for the record? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1233.785s">And</a>  could you spell your name just so we can get it correctly? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1238.453s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Wright]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1252.893s">We</a>  can certainly take a look at, and if there is some disparity between the use of those terms within the draft document, we can certainly revisit that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1263.519s">To</a>  the extent your question relates to whether or not there is such a newspaper, generally, so long as a newspaper is available in the community, so that would include the Boston Papers, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1280.845s">that</a>  would satisfy the legal requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1284.608s">There</a>  are often statutory requirements to publish in a local newspaper, particularly you've probably seen them for zoning or for probate in the state issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1299.857s">And</a>  so those can be either if you have a local Medford Mercury <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1305.085s">or</a>  if, taking you back a few years, the old Medford Mercury, or you could use a Boston newspaper as well, the Globe or the Herald. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1315.61s">So</a>  I don't know if that, I hope that's helpful.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1318.531s">Yeah,</a>  that helps a lot with the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1320.692s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1323.154s">Before</a>  we move on to article two about the legislative branch, are there any other questions or comments, motions about article one? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1334.721s">Seeing</a>  none, let's move on to Article 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1341.055s">As</a>  the first section is about composition, I'll skip over that really quickly and move on to section 2-2, Council President and Vice President Election Terms and Hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1354.824s">Do</a>  any councilors have any questions, comments, or motions about this section of the city charter? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1372.589s">I</a>  just had a question for the Collins Center, if you guys already can answer this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1382.533s">Is</a>  it normal to put very specific powers and duties for the city council president in the city charter? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1390.136s">I</a>  know something that the Charter Study Committee has been talking about is how currently in Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1396.499s">So</a>  many of these things are in separate places. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1400.161s">And</a>  something that will help us understand the charter review process better is if this is something that is normally in a city charter.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1409.906s">The</a>  answer is yes.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1411.107s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1411.627s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1418.511s">Oh,</a>  could we get your name and address for the record, too?</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1421.652s">Maryland</a>  Country is the concept.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1424.134s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1432.449s">Do</a>  we foresee any trouble with the phrase, the president shall prepare the agenda, in terms of, I know currently the president works with the clerk's office to prepare the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1444.284s">Is</a>  that something <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1446.17s">I</a>  know textually, that seems like this is the current language is quite limiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1452.071s">Is</a>  this something that has been discussed before in terms of whether that would be a problem, the president working with other people, not Councilors, to prepare the council agenda?</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1468.355s">This</a>  is kind of generic language, and it certainly doesn't forbid involving the clerk.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1476.34s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1484.862s">I</a>  see President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1487.803s">You</a>  can go to Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1489.023s">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1490.903s">George,</a>  give me a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1491.804s">Yeah,</a>  no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1492.804s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1493.604s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1494.464s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1494.824s">Thank</a>  you, Council Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1495.605s">I</a>  know that as I went through my notes, I did have a note. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1500.506s">And</a>  correct me if we'll go back to this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1502.726s">I</a>  was a little preoccupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1506.39s">As</a>  we started looking into composition of terms of office and eligibility, I wanted to ask the Collins Center, I think that one of the constituents, people that have read this and called and asked opinions, with the mayor's four-year term, and the council too, and school committee too, the question they brought up, I said, well, let me ask if it's common, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1534.457s">you</a>  see that two years really sometimes prohibits true government because you see that it's so short that you're finding that you're always politicking instead of doing what's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1546.341s">And</a>  the question is, has that been entertained? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1548.662s">Have</a>  you seen other communities do a three-year term where it's a two-year for school committee, three-year term for the council, and then four-year term for the mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1558.525s">It's</a>  just something that was asked of me, and I just wanted to get your opinion on that.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1565.473s">Well,</a>  a three-year term is very difficult.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1571.397s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1571.777s">Oh,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1576.58s">Give</a>  me one sec.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1578.281s">You're</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1579.141s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1580.642s">A</a>  three-year term is very difficult because you can't have a municipal election in the same year as a presidential. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1589.748s">Actually,</a>  a state election.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1590.968s">OK,</a>  state election. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1591.609s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1594.667s">We</a>  have communities that have three-year terms, but their elections are in June, so that they don't conflict with the dates of the state primary or the state election.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1609.07s">That's</a>  great input. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1611.61s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1613.81s">I</a>  see what they mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1614.67s">I</a>  understand what the two-year term is difficult, because it seems like you really, once you get going, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1623.857s">as</a>  an elected official, then all of a sudden you have people that you've promised so much to and they've come to you and said, now it feels like you truly are looking at times at the greater picture of an elected official. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1637.167s">That's</a>  what's the greater good of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1638.588s">So</a>  I appreciate the input and that's something I'll share with them if they're not watching tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1642.991s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1647.492s">see</a>  you president bears thank you Councilor Tseng um just a note uh we're going to come back to 2-1 and 2-4 okay um i just yeah and i appreciated the question i just want to make sure we stay on course have the discussion on those um i have as regards to section 2 or article 2 <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1668.401s">I</a>  have thoughts on 2-5, 2-7, 2-9, 2-10, and then I also have a thought on 9-6 and moving into section two. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1679.644s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1682.325s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1684.346s">Are</a>  there any other questions on section 2-2? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1690.908s">Not</a>  seeing any. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1692.488s">Section</a>  2-3, prohibitions, are there any questions from councilors on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1700.578s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1703.979s">I</a>  did have a quick question on section two, five, actually, sorry, two, five, subsection three.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1712.682s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro, I actually had a quick question about two, three. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1716.063s">Two,</a>  three, you did. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1717.304s">Could</a>  I do that one first? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1718.264s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1720.425s">So</a>  in section two, three B, it says that the city council shall contact the officers and employees serving under the mayor solely through the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1730.293s">Um,</a>  I, so I know, I think all of us as Councilors know that we're contacting city officials city staff with understanding that they serve, they serve the mayor and the people of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1744.397s">I'm,</a>  I know, I also know that a lot of us as Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1748.958s">directly</a>  outreach to a lot of city staff to ask for input, to ask for, to give suggestions and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1758.565s">Do</a>  we see this language, the language I just read out, as limiting that outreach or that interaction?</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1767.411s">Well,</a>  it's important to note that relates to section 2.6 when you're conducting an investigation, which is really different than <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1778.561s">you</a>  know, when do you pick up the trash on Maple Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1782.084s">I</a>  don't think it forbids inquiries. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1784.726s">It's</a>  when you're having an investigation or an analysis of something of, you know.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1792.512s">I</a>  just wanted to clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1793.853s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1796.095s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1799.918s">I</a>  think the question is though, not in the case of an investigation or inquiry, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1805.293s">I</a>  regularly communicate with the city assessor to set up a meeting with the resident to talk about their assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1815.881s">This</a>  would seem to prohibit me from doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1817.943s">Is</a>  that true?</p>

    <p>[Wright]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1818.463s">In</a>  my opinion, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1825.829s">The</a>  purpose of this is you cannot order <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1829.15s">Okay,</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1829.791s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1841.181s">Thank</a>  you, and I so appreciate the, first of all, the work from the commission and also the Collins Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1848.606s">I</a>  am not a member of this committee, so thank you so much for allowing me to ask a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1855.49s">This</a>  is on the same exact point. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1857.191s">I</a>  know that, for example, when we were working to try and reduce the rodent population, that the person sponsoring a piece of legislation <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1868.43s">was</a>  communicating with the staff in order to understand best how we can help the staff through the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1874.971s">The</a>  staff needed an ordinance to be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1876.932s">And</a>  so working together with staff to understand how we can best tailor the ordinance to meet the needs of the staff, that to me, like, I'm 100% in favor of <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1891.825s">nor</a>  shall any member of the city council give orders or direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1894.967s">Absolutely,</a>  I 100% agree.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1896.247s">But</a>  you're looking for coordination, communication.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1899.229s">It</a>  just says, you know, the city council shall contact only solely through the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1904.072s">And</a>  it seems like getting information on how to craft ordinances to best meet the needs of staff, that's, I just wanna make sure, again, we're all asking about this.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1914.317s">We</a>  wanna make sure that it's. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1915.838s">Maybe</a>  we'll look at this language</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1918.259s">That</a>  would be amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1919.399s">I</a>  just specifically, I mean, I wasn't the sponsor of rodent control, but I know how much, you know, that was something staff needed and that the sponsor of that ordinance needed to just hear from and worked with staff members to craft it carefully so that it met the needs of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1936.866s">So</a>  those kinds of things I think are important that we are able to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1941.967s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1943.288s">President</a>  Bears?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1944.577s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1945.037s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1945.157s">And</a>  I think, um, obviously subject if you want to take a look at it and come back, but it would seem to me that if the intent is to make clear that the council cannot order a city employee to do anything, um, maybe just eliminating everything between the comma after section two, six and the word neither. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1965.448s">So</a>  eliminating the city council shall contact the officers and employees serving under the mayor solely through the mayor and <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1972.027s">because</a>  then it would just read, except for the purpose of inquiries and investigations pursuant to section two, six, neither the city council nor any member of the city council shall give orders or directions to any officer or employee, either publicly or privately. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1984.796s">I</a>  don't know if that makes sense to folks.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1991.801s">I</a>  would really like to talk to the author before I comment.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1998.786s">I'll</a>  make a motion to <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2002.62s">make</a>  that amendment pending further discussion and information from the representatives from the Collins Center.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2011.845s">Can</a>  you email that to the court?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2015.928s">Or</a>  yeah, I can work on emailing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2017.829s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2018.872s">Great,</a>  we have a motion on the floor by President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2022.694s">Anna's</a>  gonna email it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2024.595s">Okay,</a>  do we have a second by Councilor Lazzaro? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2030.338s">Seeing</a>  that there might be a lot of motions at the end of this meeting, I think it would be wise to take this vote now, when you're ready, Mr. Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2040.023s">I'll</a>  give you a second.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2055.592s">President</a>  Ferris. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2056.352s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2057.332s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2059.533s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2061.373s">Councilor</a>  Blasaro.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2073.216s">Yeah,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2076.177s">It</a>  would remove the sentence, the city council shall contact the officers and employees serving under the mayor solely through the mayor and <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2084.063s">but</a>  maintains the intent that we could not give orders or directions.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2090.568s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2091.189s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2091.589s">Five</a>  in favor, none opposed, motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2096.233s">Are</a>  there any other comments on section two, four? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2101.557s">Seeing</a>  none. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2102.838s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2103.179s">Section</a>  two, five, exercise of powers quorum rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2108.022s">President</a>  Bears, your mic is live.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2111.786s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2112.346s">I</a>  just had one one item here under section two five subsection one that the regular meetings of the city council be held at a time and place fixed by ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2125.57s">I</a>  would change that to the city council rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2127.691s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2129.731s">Is</a>  that a motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2130.472s">That</a>  that would be a motion, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2132.596s">We</a>  have a motion from President Bears to amend the words fixed by ordinance to fixed by city council rules in section 2-5B1.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2147.307s">And</a>  the clerk already has that language in the document I sent over. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2150.589s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2152.931s">Before,</a>  do we have a second for that motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2156.634s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2157.694s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro?</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2160.23s">I</a>  have a question just about the process of amending the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2164.831s">We</a>  do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2165.571s">We</a>  change the city council rules in city council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2170.592s">But</a>  if it's in. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2173.353s">If</a>  it's an ordinance, it needs three readings, uh, to change an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2178.173s">It</a>  can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2178.674s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2187.51s">Just</a>  as a reminder, or maybe just for the public record, if we can just quickly go over how we change the rules, we do that with a resolution in city council?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2196.036s">Through</a>  the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2198.998s">Yeah,</a>  the city council can change the rules of the city council by majority vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2204.161s">But</a>  it doesn't require multiple readings.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2208.004s">I</a>  know oftentimes it goes through, I believe now it's admin and finance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2213.8s">Oh,</a>  we haven't had to do it this term, but oftentimes it does go through committee first. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2225.025s">Any</a>  other comments on section 2-5? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2228.687s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2230.788s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro has seconded President Ferris' motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2235.43s">Let</a>  me check on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2239.052s">Seeing</a>  none. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2240.533s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2242.269s">when</a>  you're ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2249.655s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2249.775s">Oh,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2250.356s">Yes,</a>  I had a question about 2-5 section B subsection 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2257.362s">It</a>  says all sessions of the City Council and of every committee or subcommittee of the City Council shall be open to the public unless another provision is allowed by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2265.689s">The</a>  only thing that comes to mind is executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2268.291s">I</a>  know that's allowed by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2269.912s">It</a>  doesn't happen very frequently in our meetings, but I just wonder if that's something we would want to say officially in the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2279.296s">If</a>  it's not necessary, we don't need to say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2281.217s">It</a>  just occurred to me to ask about it.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2284.378s">Is</a>  that something the Collins Center would like to respond to?</p>

    <p>[Wright]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2295.003s">In</a>  my opinion, it would just <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2299.785s">language</a>  captures the idea of this executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2305.408s">But</a>  if you want it to be more clear, we could look at it, but I think it would capture it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2312.612s">And</a>  then certainly that's state law as well.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2317.374s">That's</a>  fine, that's sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2318.575s">I'm</a>  comfortable with that, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2320.396s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2321.796s">Are</a>  there any other comments on the substance in 2-5 before we take up President Bears' motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2330.362s">seeing</a>  none from councillors. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2333.004s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, are you ready for the vote?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2337.428s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2337.828s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2338.549s">President</a>  Ferris, would you change the language of prior City Council meetings to be fixed by ordinance item 2.5.B.1 to be fixed by Council rules? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2346.215s">Is</a>  that correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2346.936s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2348.477s">Second</a>  from Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2350.739s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2351.839s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2352.32s">President</a>  Ferris? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2353.261s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2354.321s">Vice</a>  President Collins?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2395.743s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2396.404s">Councilor</a>  Tseng, um, regarding this section, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2404.731s">I</a>  had, well, one comment, which this is the first item that incorporates one of the charter amendments passed in the last term, six to one, subsection B. In the initial draft, I would propose that it be subsection C, but subject to appropriation, the council being able to have additional support positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2424.908s">That</a>  was something we advocated for in the last term, and I appreciate its inclusion in this draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2430.059s">My</a>  main questions and my proposal here is one, the city messenger position that wasn't included. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2441.807s">So</a>  I proposed that it be included. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2444.209s">And</a>  so that would be a new subsection B. And then I also noted that section A didn't include a residency requirement for the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2453.755s">I</a>  put a draft together that put it back in, but I'm interested to hear <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2460.608s">if</a>  that was not included purposefully or if there's another provision of Massachusetts general law that would cover residency or just the reason that that was not mentioned as regards to the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2474.352s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2475.833s">There's</a>  a lot there. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2478.694s">I</a>  know your most direct question is about the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2481.615s">I</a>  was wondering if maybe chair McDonald or the call center would be able to speak to that.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2499.025s">I</a>  don't remember this coming up in the Charter Commission in the Charter Review Committee meetings and so it could be an oversight but I we do have concerns about residency requirements and in terms of it limits the application pool significantly <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2530.384s">and</a>  it can be perceived as sort of assuring that someone from within gets the job.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2539.591s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2543.173s">Withdraw</a>  my motion related to residency for the city clerk.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2548.317s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2550.538s">I</a>  haven't made a motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2553.38s">That,</a>  once I submit it, I will not move.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2557.592s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2559.972s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2561.013s">Before</a>  I move on, if anybody wants any information about my glasses, it's a new, very expensive company that I can share with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2573.215s">It's</a>  called Broke. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2575.095s">It's</a>  called Half Glass. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2576.175s">It's</a>  called Broke Cheats. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2578.916s">So</a>  I apologize for that, because I know my wife's watching right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2582.237s">And</a>  when I come home tonight, she's going to smash me with one of the <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2585.362s">the</a>  15 pairs I have at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2586.222s">But</a>  the question I had was, I know that as we talked about this, I had a question that a resident asked, and I know it's by ordinance, but when we have boards and commissions, have you ever seen a charter, a part of the charter be put in more, anything that would recommend the concerns of residency requirements for different boards and commissions? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2611.47s">Is</a>  that something that, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2613.154s">we</a>  would put in our charter or something.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2615.175s">You</a>  could, you certainly could. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2616.856s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2617.236s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2617.416s">So</a>  I, if I could, that'd be something that I don't see it in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2622.119s">So</a>  I think that where we can fit that, I think that that's been a concern where we've had commissions or boards of commissions in the city that residents might've been living here and we can understand if they moved out that they finished the term, but we're seeing a lot of people that, that we see people that have been on boards of commissions that don't even live in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2643.577s">So</a>  I think that, you know, finding that language and seeing if that's something we should visit, if that, we could see anything pertaining to that would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2653.623s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2656.045s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2659.227s">Is</a>  there any, are there any motions or comments, questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2663.95s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2664.27s">If</a>  I can, just make a motion to request friends from the Collins Senate to see if they can draft any, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2673.867s">information</a>  that might be prudent for us to look at and maybe vote on for the possibility of resident requirements for boards and commissions.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2684.756s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2687.598s">I</a>  would move to adopt the amendment to include the city messenger and the charter and <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2697.54s">then</a>  just renumerate, subsection B would become subsection C, subsection D would be, C would become D, and the city messenger section would be subsection B, and that language is also in the document.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2715.568s">I</a>  believe we have two motions on the floor, the first one being Councilor Scarpelli's motion on the residency requirements for the call center to propose draft language for the city council on residency requirements for multiple member boards.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2733.662s">I'd</a>  be happy to try and make my motion with Councilor Scarpelli, so I just take one vote.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2738.245s">And</a>  I assume you're seconding it?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2745.566s">Yeah,</a>  it's all one.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2746.827s">Do</a>  it all together. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2752.69s">Are</a>  there any comments from Chairman Golds before we take that vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2762.196s">Well,</a>  would you have any comments on that resolution or on that motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2769.881s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2773.221s">Yes,</a>  the city messenger and residency requirements for multiple member boards, although that's for a future meeting.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2783.489s">Yeah,</a>  I think it is there, and I think it's two meetings away.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2786.151s">Yeah,</a>  I think that was my recollection as well, but I'm happy to just vote on the motion.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2793.276s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, are you ready? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2794.557s">I</a>  am. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2794.798s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2797.58s">President</a>  Bears? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2798.32s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2800.142s">Vice</a>  President Collins?</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2801.343s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2807.277s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2807.917s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2808.418s">Five</a>  in favor, none opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2809.918s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2812.678s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2816.499s">Now</a>  section two dash eight ordinances and other measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2820.5s">Are</a>  there any comments, questions, motions from, from Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2833.442s">I</a>  know, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2834.632s">There</a>  will be discussion later tonight on the composition, the proposed composition for city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2841.456s">I'm</a>  assuming some of the numbers here will depend on the outcome of those conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2851.168s">I</a>  did have some more technical questions for the Collins Center, if it's all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2856.87s">In</a>  the first line of this section, it says, no ordinance shall be passed finally on the date it is introduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2865.472s">Is</a>  that date the first reading of the proposed ordinance? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2871.654s">Is</a>  it when the councilor proposes, like comes to a city council meeting with ordinance text proposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2878.155s">I</a>  know we've had situations where both <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2880.687s">are</a>  happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2881.187s">Of</a>  course, the former being more common. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2883.189s">The</a>  latter has happened in the city council before too.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2886.332s">Yeah,</a>  but it refers to the former.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2889.034s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2897.72s">I</a>  know there's also discussion of emergency ordinances here.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2902.384s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2904.822s">it</a>  makes sense to me, the current language that an emergency ordinance shall be repealed after the expiration of 60 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2912.385s">Is</a>  there much of a, this is something that's new to Medford, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2918.767s">Is</a>  there much of a discussion in terms of whether, of making that vote a repeal vote versus an affirmative vote to enshrine?</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2930.512s">You</a>  can replace the emergency ordinance with something permanent. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2936.705s">So</a>  if that's the direction that you're moving in terms of addressing the issue.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2944.527s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2945.167s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2946.488s">I</a>  believe that's all I had for this section. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2955.169s">Are</a>  there any other comments or questions from councillors? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2960.925s">George,</a>  I've, you has read for some reason, but you didn't have anything, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2966.549s">Great,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2968.651s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2969.492s">Moving</a>  on to section 2-9. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2972.194s">City</a>  council confirmation of certain appointments. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2974.155s">Do</a>  any other, do any councilors have comments or questions on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2977.978s">I</a>  see President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2979.94s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2980.641s">Thank</a>  you Chair Tsang. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2982.802s">This</a>  is the second of the three charter amendments passed in 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2990.703s">three,</a>  I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2994.165s">And</a>  this regards the Council confirming the appointments of the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2999.629s">The</a>  initial amendment that we had put forward that wasn't advanced to the legislature at the time by the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3007.513s">would</a>  have had us affirmatively approving all appointments unless otherwise noted by mass general law by majority vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3017.215s">This</a>  has us having to take a specific motion to reject an appointment by a two thirds vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3026.997s">I</a>  do know that there were some concerns by the mayor about having to send all of the appointments to the council and get affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3036.511s">votes,</a>  I did read through the study committee report and found that that was relatively common. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3045.177s">But</a>  in the spirit of compromise, I can understand that concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3049.82s">And</a>  I would just propose changing the threshold from a two-thirds vote to a majority vote, which also seems to be very common across most communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3059.947s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3080.107s">I</a>  think that's a really good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3081.228s">Uh</a>  do folks from do any other city councilors have thoughts on. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3084.97s">Oh.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3086.511s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3087.692s">Thank</a>  you and appreciate constantly has bringing us forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3089.733s">I</a>  know that, um and the spirit of what I've seen with this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3094.897s">I</a>  think having that majority vote in my opinion is isn't robust enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3100.08s">I</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3108.88s">some</a>  authority and more openness and transparency when it comes to positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3114.044s">I</a>  know that one of the biggest things we've seen over the last couple of years is that the positions that are created that this council doesn't even vote for. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3122.931s">And</a>  that's happened multiple times, not just with this council, but previous councils. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3130.357s">So</a>  I think lessening that and giving the mayor's office more of autonomy to make these decisions <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3138.996s">without</a>  a more weighted process that really makes it accountable for the position that she's presenting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3155.589s">I</a>  think I would rather see the two-thirds vote for the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3162.334s">That</a>  meat is needed.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3163.615s">So</a>  I think my opinions, I don't disagree if I make sure I don't disagree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3169.1s">So</a>  this, the way it's written without my amendment is the council would need two thirds to reject. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3176.305s">So</a>  we wouldn't see everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3178.743s">that</a>  we would only appointments would be made and then we would have 30 days to say we don't want that appointment and then it will require two thirds to reject that appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3188.23s">So</a>  it's not saying they would come before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3190.171s">I</a>  actually agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3191.132s">I</a>  support. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3191.712s">Yeah,</a>  I would support if someone else wanted to move in that direction more. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3196.448s">affirmative</a>  process where all of the appointments come before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3200.449s">But</a>  in the absence of that, I don't think it should require two-thirds for rejection. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3204.85s">I</a>  think it should require just a simple majority to reject an appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3208.131s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3208.671s">I</a>  misunderstood.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3209.771s">I</a>  just wanted to note that we... I'm reading the red line as I'm reading the original, so... Yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3214.652s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3216.113s">I</a>  withdraw. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3216.693s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3217.093s">Yeah,</a>  I just wanted to... I completely agree with your sentiment on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3219.914s">I</a>  want us to be able to have more authority as regards appointments.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3226.594s">I</a>  know, so right now, just to summarize, we are debating or we are discussing changing the requirements that city council reject mayoral appointees with a two-thirds majority, changing that, amending that to just the majority, a majority to reject an appointee, just to frame this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3249.93s">Do</a>  any other councilors have comments on that proposal, on President Bears's motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3263.239s">Is</a>  there any comment from the Charter Study Committee, from Collin Sentry? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3268.641s">Seeing</a>  none, do we have a second for President Bears' motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3275.963s">I'll</a>  second. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3276.963s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3306.451s">I</a>  just want to read this back, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3309.974s">President</a>  Bears, would you include language that a rejection of certain mayoral appointments can be done by a majority vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3316.66s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3316.9s">Is</a>  that how you want that? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3317.781s">It's</a>  the recommendation that the state supports that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3322.866s">I'll</a>  second if the Council is compelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3327.37s">President</a>  Bears? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3328.171s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3328.851s">Vice</a>  President Collins?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3331.414s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3335.459s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3336.301s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3336.842s">Chair</a>  Tsang? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3337.483s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3338.004s">I</a>  have five in favor, none opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3340.569s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3353.887s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3354.607s">Some</a>  of them would pertain if there was a change in the proposed composition. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3358.809s">So</a>  I'll hold those, but we did receive a communication and I noted as well from the chair of the elections commission that the references to the city clerk in here should be references to the elections commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3373.835s">And</a>  so I would move to make those changes, but I'm also just want to see if that is an issue or if the comment center representatives have any <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3384.696s">notes</a>  on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3385.516s">If</a>  it should stay as city clerk because we technically adopted a law that said the Elections Commission shall act as city clerk and therefore there are Massachusetts general laws that reference the clerk and not the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3397.079s">But</a>  that seems kind of convoluted.</p>

    <p>[Wright]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3401.1s">We</a>  can certainly revisit state law and make sure everything's in compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3408.541s">Get</a>  to the point where we bring together the final draft.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3412.216s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3412.856s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3412.996s">I</a>  just think we did hear that note that, I mean, we have the elections commission model. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3417.057s">We</a>  adopted the mass general law provision. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3419.537s">I</a>  can't remember what it is now, a couple of years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3422.378s">So</a>  we have an elections commission running the elections, not the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3426.279s">So</a>  I'll just move to put that in our notes to the call center as they, so that they can make sure that that is accurate in the final draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3453.355s">reflect</a>  the system that we are operating under.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3460.462s">Sorry,</a>  Councilor Collins is telling me that my mic was not on. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3465.347s">For</a>  Councilor Collins, President Bears has made a motion to request that the Collins Center <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3470.826s">look</a>  at section 2-10, make sure that the references to the city clerk and the election commissions reflect the system that we operate here. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3485.174s">I</a>  did have one more substance-based question for the members of the Collins Center or the Charter Study Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3492.819s">I</a>  know that there, so there's a reference to, so there's a less than 30% mark. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3500.216s">for</a>  filling the vacancies. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3503.298s">This</a>  is something that I find reasonable, but I'm curious how he arrived at 30% as a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3520.851s">Chair</a>  McDonald? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3522.712s">Oh</a>  yeah, could you come to the microphone so folks at home and other Councilors can hear? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3530.028s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3530.528s">Hi,</a>  Milva McDonald, 61 Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3534.369s">As</a>  part of the discussion, we looked at other charters and we talked about it and that seemed like a reasonable provision, so we included it.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3544.192s">I</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3545.913s">Are</a>  there charters that go, maybe this is a question that the call-in center would know more.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3550.774s">There</a>  are some that go to 40%. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3552.055s">It's</a>  30, there are probably a couple at 25.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3561.037s">I</a>  see, so 30 is more of like a median number?</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3563.238s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3565.059s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3568.021s">Are</a>  there any other questions or comments on section 210 from councillors?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3576.446s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3577.886s">President</a>  Bears? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3582.749s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3583.51s">I</a>  did the wrong mic.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3586.849s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3587.409s">Yeah,</a>  I just, I would have some concerns at 30% if the composition of the council were to be as proposed by the study committee, because there'd be a lot of one-on-one races for seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3600.054s">And</a>  I would think that in that situation, a 30% result would be not representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3609.378s">So</a>  I just want to note that composition wise, that would be a concern for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3614.946s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3615.506s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3616.667s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3616.988s">President</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3618.269s">Um,</a>  it's my opinion is similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3620.731s">I</a>  didn't want to, um, well, I can't make any motions from the chair, but I also didn't want to make any proposals before we moved before we talked about composition. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3630.899s">Um,</a>  because I think a lot of this, this does hinge on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3635.743s">Are</a>  there any motions of councils are, um, I actually have a question on that.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3641.228s">The,</a>  so <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3644.635s">If</a>  a vacancy occurs in the office of Councilor at large, that position is filled by, is it pulled from one of the ward Councilors based on votes received? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3661.125s">I'm</a>  confused about. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3662.866s">Or</a>  one of the people who was running for at large, as long as they didn't get less than 30, but you had to have been running for at large.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3671.571s">It's</a>  my understanding that it's the latter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3673.252s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3674.653s">The</a>  call center is confirmed, just for folks watching online. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3678.075s">Got</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3682.036s">Got</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3682.597s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3684.358s">I</a>  know vacancies is something that we talked about in my charter study committee interview way back when. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3691.681s">We</a>  talked about different ways of looking at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3695.183s">I</a>  know there are a lot of arguments that cut in favor of keeping it this way as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3703.531s">I</a>  know the main criticism with having the next runner-up fill the seat is that, as President Bears referred to, the next runner-up might not be representative of the will of the voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3716.263s">But</a>  there is also a worry that we would end up having to run a lot of special elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3721.428s">That</a>  costs money and time and operational energy at City Hall as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3727.733s">So</a>  something to consider as we move forward, but I do think that a lot of this does hinge on the conversation about competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3736.755s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3738.395s">If</a>  I can, I think that with the professionals from the Collins Center, 40% sounds like a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3747.257s">What</a>  would you recommend? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3749.398s">What</a>  have you seen that really works and where that middle ground where the, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3756.863s">extra</a>  one-on-one elections that might cost the city money.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3759.864s">To</a>  me, it's the process, but... Well, I think there's also really concern about low turnout at special elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3769.027s">So</a>  that's not representative of what the electorate might want. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3775.23s">At</a>  least in choosing the runner up, if they got 30% of the vote, at least you know that they attracted some attention.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3784.748s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3785.368s">And</a>  people thought that they could serve.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3788.349s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3788.83s">And</a>  that's my fear. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3791.371s">We're</a>  seeing what's coming out in local elections recently in Medford, you know, with 60,000 residents and 40,000, 35,000, 40,000 voters and only 13,000, 14,000, 15,000 coming out. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3798.333s">I</a>  think that would pose a problem for the process, you know, going any higher.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3818.443s">Right,</a>  those who participated in that election.</p>

    <p>[Wright]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3821.524s">It's</a>  votes cast. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3823.665s">Yeah,</a>  it's votes cast, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3827.147s">And</a>  keep in mind, it's for the remainder of the existing term. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3831.529s">So</a>  they're not getting a full term.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3834.63s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Wright]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3835.13s">They're</a>  only completing a two-year term. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3839.572s">And</a>  they do not get to put on, if they run for the seat after the end of that term. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3846.441s">They</a>  are not candidates for re-election. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3848.822s">We</a>  will not say that.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3851.784s">President</a>  Barras, to that point in your research, have you found there to be a significant difference in incumbency bias between someone who has the label candidate for re-election and someone who doesn't, even if they were serving?</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3865.291s">No,</a>  I've never seen a study on it.</p>

    <p>[Wright]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3873.775s">There's</a>  a perception, there is a perception, and there also can be, in some communities, a designation that candidates for re-election are put at the top of the ticket.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3888.702s">Right,</a>  which I think this charter gets rid of.</p>

    <p>[Wright]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3891.524s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3891.964s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3893.685s">I'm</a>  just wondering how much, if you had any knowledge on how much that benefit to incumbents <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3899.629s">is</a>  literally the label on the ballot or being able to put Councilor X on their literature or just being in the meetings.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3907.17s">I</a>  think just being on the council, it's a familiar name.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3913.812s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3914.332s">You've</a>  seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3916.172s">It's</a>  familiarity, I think.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3918.493s">Yeah,</a>  that's just where I think, I understand why to say, oh, they wouldn't be able to put that on the ballot, but I don't know that that <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3929.137s">I'll</a>  get to my point around that when we talk about composition of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3932.708s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3934.574s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3937.228s">I</a>  just wanted to clarify that the current text of the ordinance or of the draft city charter is that if they don't reach that 30% threshold, not that we would hold a special election. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3948.656s">So</a>  if we amended that number, it wouldn't be that we hold a special election. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3953.38s">The</a>  current draft charter says the remaining members of the city council would appoint to fill the vacancy for the rest of the term. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3961.026s">That's</a>  in subsection C. Just to clarify that point for folks at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3967.904s">That</a>  is something that we could change as a council, right, but I don't hear any appetite to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3975.473s">Yes,</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3977.816s">I</a>  would just note of all of those options that being selected by duly elected people versus low turnout special election versus low threshold of voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3986.506s">being</a>  a selection being made by the rest of the council is probably the most representative of the will of the people in that situation, because the people elected the other Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3996.088s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3997.128s">Thank</a>  you, President Ferris. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3998.388s">I</a>  know we have one motion from President Ferris on the floor regarding... There's the Elections Commission, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4009.731s">Do</a>  we have a second for that motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4014.492s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4015.252s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, when you're ready.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4019.909s">President</a>  President Bears with the council language of elections to ensure the language we use reflects the system that we operate method. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4028.696s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4092.262s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4094.523s">And</a>  I appreciate you including this in this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4099.41s">as</a>  I was going through a section 9-6 in the existing charter's periodic review of ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4105.374s">And</a>  to me, ordinances are the purview of the legislative branch. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4109.397s">Of</a>  course, the mayor has the ability to sign or veto, but the ordinance authority lies with the legislative branch. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4117.263s">And</a>  to me, I believe that we should move this section 9-6 to section 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4123.908s">I</a>  relabel it section 2-11. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4127.612s">and</a>  then I would make two minor changes, which would be that the city council shall provide for a review. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4133.776s">Right</a>  now it says the mayor and city council, and I would just change that to read the city council, and that the review shall be made by a special committee to be established by ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4143.663s">I</a>  would change that to be established by a vote of the city council.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4146.405s">Okay,</a>  we have a motion from President Bears on a number of amendments, but <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4153.915s">namely</a>  that the special committee be established by a vote at the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4158.779s">Do</a>  we have a second for that motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4161.841s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4163.122s">Before</a>  we take that- It would be a motion to adopt the language as I propose.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4167.185s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4167.605s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4169.227s">And</a>  we all have that language from the agenda packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4172.509s">Councilor</a>  Lemie?</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4174.951s">Thank</a>  you, Chair Sang, for letting me speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4178.594s">Just</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4179.418s">To</a>  clarify for the folks at home, neither Councilor Callahan nor I are on this committee, which means that we can't vote or make motions, but we are at the invitation of the chair able to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4195.685s">The</a>  one concern that I had was eliminating the part that says the mayor and city council is that you likely would need some support from the executive branch when advertising for the positions that go <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4212.131s">that</a>  would go into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4213.652s">So</a>  it would help to, you know, have the support from the executive branch to be able to put out feelers. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4220.514s">I</a>  fully support having it be confirmed by having them be confirmed by a vote of the city council, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4225.795s">So</a>  that's just that's just one thought as a potential consequence of removing the mayor and city council, keeping it just city councils that I think would be you do need some staff support for this kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4239.6s">I</a>  would imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4241.12s">Um</a>  And also the city solicitor would be Under under the mayor as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4248.068s">So</a>  that's another concern I would have with removing that explicitly. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4252.594s">I</a>  did have some questions about this for the call in center. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4257.599s">If</a>  I'm if I'm able, um <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4261.271s">So</a>  this struck me as a, so two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4267.556s">One,</a>  is this something that is typically in ordinances in other cities? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4271.318s">And</a>  if so, what usually results from that? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4278.424s">So</a>  have there been, are there usually like pretty substantial changes that come out of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4283.247s">committees,</a>  periodic reviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4285.809s">Are</a>  there any specific instances you can think of where this might have affected policy in the past? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4292.414s">I</a>  just feel like a little bit more historical context would help me out with this one.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4296.418s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4297.598s">This</a>  is very common in charters that you go through a periodic review of the ordinances following a review of the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4308.447s">What</a>  we're trying to guarantee is that those two documents stay in harmony <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4313.388s">you</a>  know, for the time, but you understand what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4324.271s">We</a>  don't want one to say one thing and one the other.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4327.592s">So</a>  the real point of this is to make sure that the ordinances are consistent with any updates to the charter.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4333.913s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4334.554s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4335.414s">And</a>  the other is you can then update from any <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4340.952s">references</a>  to state law, any changes to state law that affect your structure and organization that would be in the ordinances, that would be a time that you could make that change.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4351.822s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4352.942s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4356.365s">I</a>  know there was a question for Councilor Fleming about the proposed motion, President</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4366.235s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4366.535s">Yeah,</a>  given Councilor Lemmy's comment, I'm happy to amend my proposal to not strike the words mayor and, and then I also just noticed that I also should have changed that the special committee shall file its report with the city clerk on a date specified by a vote of the city council instead of by ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4385.679s">So</a>  I would just further amend my proposal based on Councilor Lemmy's comment and based on that.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4391.94s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4393.36s">Could</a>  you? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4394.821s">I'll</a>  email it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4396.703s">Councilor</a>  Callaghan, and then Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4404.165s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4404.525s">I</a>  just had one quick question, which I think Councilor Bears may have just answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4410.547s">It's</a>  not clear to me who is on the committee or who puts people on the committee, but it sounds like what Councilor Bears is suggesting is that it says, this review shall be made by a special committee to be established by a vote of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4424.371s">So</a>  that would be the council that is <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4426.864s">I</a>  just wanted to understand what that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4430.026s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4430.466s">This</a>  is a suggestion to amend</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4455.857s">If</a>  the intention of this would be to make the ordinances be in alignment with an updated charter, maybe it could say, with every change to the charter, may there be an update or a review of ordinances to align with the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4473.109s">This</a>  section looks like, and it does say at five-year intervals and each year ending in a seven or a two, it doesn't say every time you update the charter, you'll review all the ordinances to see that they're in alignment with the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4485.975s">So</a>  there's no implication in this language that that is why it's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4491.88s">To</a>  me, I read this and I thought it was saying there's a special committee appointed to read all of the local ordinances of the city and review them, which I always understood to be the work of city council and what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4506.893s">on</a>  a regular basis anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4509.034s">So</a>  I thought this was at best redundant as a section to work that's already being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4517.639s">So</a>  maybe I think my amendment to President Bears's motion would be to say, upon review or changes made to the city charter, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4535.436s">and</a>  then the rest of this section.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4538.639s">It's</a>  my understanding from the Collins Center's earlier comment that it's not just for city charter changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4545.505s">It's</a>  also when Massachusetts state law changes.</p>

    <p>[Healy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4548.347s">As</a>  the state law changes.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4549.608s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4550.449s">And</a>  it's mostly to do with your structure and organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4555.333s">It's</a>  not a comprehensive review in the sense that you have to go through every licensing arrangement, especially if it hasn't changed.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4566.887s">I</a>  think what would be helpful to folks at home and for Councilors is, because Benford hasn't had something like this, at least not under the present form of the charter, could you give us a look into, I think you've described the role, like what they would be doing, but what does this committee typically look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4583.893s">Is</a>  it composed of lawyers?</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4588.055s">Sometimes</a>  it's composed, not totally of lawyers, but usually <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4593.219s">a</a>  lawyer, maybe a current Councilor, a former Councilor, someone with familiarity with the work, maybe a member of the planning board or the school committee, just willing to get different voices in the sense of their perception of how this ordinance has or has not worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4617.67s">Is</a>  it meeting the intent when you have to? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4624.652s">anybody</a>  seeing any glitches or hitches that you could propose to modify.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4630.818s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4631.238s">I</a>  think that helps a lot with with our understanding of what this is meant to meant to be.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4637.583s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4638.404s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4639.705s">I</a>  know President Bears has requested the mic. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4642.828s">I</a>  also did have a question for Okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4646.371s">I</a>  did have a question for President Bears in by changing the first <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4652.12s">It's</a>  the first reference to the ordinance to a vote of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4655.701s">I</a>  know. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4655.921s">And</a>  then two sentences from there, it says on a shelf file, it's report with the city clerk on a date specified by ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4664.144s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4681.851s">Give</a>  us a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4682.612s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4689.384s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4722.047s">Great,</a>  on President Bears' motion, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4726.649s">President</a>  Bears, oh, sorry.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4742.555s">This</a>  motion would move section 9-6 to article 2, make it section 2-11. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4750.368s">It</a>  would then change the words by ordinance to by vote of the City Council, both in the second sentence and the fourth sentence.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4769.293s">Do</a>  we still have your second on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4773.915s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, when you're ready.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4782.173s">present</a>  bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4783.754s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4784.555s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4785.896s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4786.136s">That's</a>  a little bizarre. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4788.958s">That's</a>  a scrupley chair saying yes.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4791.86s">Five</a>  in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4792.681s">None</a>  opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4793.481s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4795.203s">Um,</a>  back to the fun part. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4797.745s">Um,</a>  I know President Bears, um, sent us a proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4803.929s">I</a>  recognize you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4804.59s">This</a>  would be on the on composition. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4807.172s">Section</a>  two dash</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4812.979s">Can</a>  I make a motion actually regarding section 2-4 first? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4817.28s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4818.42s">I</a>  would just move that we move section 2-4 to a future meeting and to discuss sections 2-4, 3-1 and 4-4 as a single conversation at a future meeting.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4838.324s">So</a>  that's 2-4, 3-1, 4-4? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4842.22s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4845.581s">President</a>  Bears has moved to discuss, to move section 2-4 to another meeting for discussion, and to discuss it along with 3-1, 4-4, which I understand are all about compensation of the council, the mayor, and the school committee.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4864.666s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4864.826s">Do</a>  we have a second on President Bears' motion?</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4880.605s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4920.575s">Thank</a>  you, Chair Tsang, and just given the length of the meeting so far to get through the smaller stuff, I figured this is gonna take a while, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4933.99s">And</a>  also I think it seems to be the main point of discussion around the proposals that I put forward was around the composition of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4942.676s">So</a>  just to set the frame here, the charter study committee recommended to the mayor and then through that to the council, city council composed of 11 members, eight representing each individual ward of the city and three elected at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4963.857s">And</a>  something that I discussed in my conversations with the Charter Study Committee and something that I've had a lot of conversations with the past few years has been what the composition of the council should look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4984.232s">And</a>  part of the proposal that I put forward tonight, which is to amend that proposal to have <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4991.336s">to</a>  follow what the Charter Study Committee proposed for the school committee, which would be a city council of seven members, three elected at large, and four from districts, which would be composed of two boards each, stems from three factors. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5006.586s">One</a>  are my principles, two are the data, and three are my experience serving on the council and serving in the leadership of the council for the past three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5019.638s">I</a>  think we've had a lot of conversation in the state and in the country about how should we elect elected officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5028.842s">And</a>  we're one of only actually I think three countries on a federal level that elects our legislatures by first past the post single district voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5040.187s">And</a>  I think one of the great advantages of the system that we have now, and I'm not advocating that we maintain an all at large system, is that everybody <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5048.804s">faces</a>  a competitive election. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5051.425s">There's</a>  one district. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5052.826s">Everybody's</a>  running against each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5055.207s">There's</a>  no sailing through. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5056.428s">And</a>  there was a great New York Times piece talking about proportional representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5062.791s">That's</a>  a model that the Cambridge Planning Charter uses. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5067.373s">And</a>  you see, through that model, the election of people of differing ideologies representing different bases of voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5077.288s">Another</a>  conversation that's been discussed is a multi member districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5082.472s">We</a>  also had the statewide ballot question on rank choice voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5087.035s">And</a>  all of those are different ways to try to elect people that is not a first pass the posting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5093.62s">And</a>  the reason for that is that a first pass the post single district system tends to have <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5099.537s">less</a>  than ideal outcomes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5101.639s">And</a>  I think what is being proposed or was proposed with having a single district first past the post war districts might lead that direction here in the city as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5114.554s">I</a>  have always been a strong supporter of more localized representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5120.338s">I</a>  just think that there are different ways to have ward representation, different ways to have district representation than just saying our only options are all at large or all ward or a hybrid where you have only at large and only ward systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5137.288s">So</a>  I think the charter study committee's proposal for the school committee and the reason that I went in that direction <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5144.027s">with</a>  my proposal is that it was already in the draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5148.41s">I'd</a>  love to have a bigger conversation about more unique and interesting opportunities and options like proportional representation or ranked choice voting or multi-member districts, but those weren't surveyed, those weren't discussed, those weren't put forward as options. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5165.699s">I</a>  went into the product, the work product of the charter study committee itself and found something that I think met the goal of having more localized representation while also maintaining some of the benefits of the at-large system and while avoiding some of the downsides of having so many of the council seats filled by first past the post single member districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5189.098s">And</a>  that's why I proposed what I proposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5192.882s">I</a>  mentioned a few different items here in my initial memorandum representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5200.493s">This</a>  does bring us to local representation very much so compared to the existing approach of all at large council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5210.341s">accessibility-wise,</a>  it would be, I think, easier for voters to understand having a district Councilor, a district school committee member, and then the at-large members. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5222.268s">They'd</a>  have less voters to, you know, less officials to keep track of, in some senses, or not exactly knowing which side of which street they lived on means that this is their Councilor versus that Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5235.975s">Certainly</a>  from an efficiency perspective, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5239.326s">there</a>  wouldn't be a need for more Councilors, chamber renovations, the meetings being longer because more Councilors are talking. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5248.816s">I'm</a>  less married to those arguments, although I think they are just facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5256.745s">And</a>  that is to say that I'm not opposed to a larger council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5260.73s">I</a>  just don't think that a larger council should be made up of first-past-the-post single-member districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5266.715s">And</a>  some of the great discussion that has happened since I put these out and discussions that I had with lots of folks over the past two, three years, I want to note as well, from a representation perspective, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5282.118s">you</a>  would have under the ward system of having eight wards versus four districts, significantly different weighting of individuals votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5291.682s">If</a>  you're a voter in ward two or ward three, where you have very, very high turnout, your vote would be much less valuable to the selection of a Councilor than a vote in ward one. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5301.447s">And</a>  I think that's an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5303.908s">I</a>  think the district moving to the district model mediates that somewhat. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5309.382s">You'd</a>  also, from a representation perspective, if you look at, for example, racial demographics, there's essentially no difference in racial demographics between the Ward 6 seat and Ward 8 seats being separate and them being combined. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5326.19s">There's</a>  somewhat of a difference in the Ward 7 seat versus combining the Wards 1 and 7 seats, but it's, I think, less than five points or maybe less than 10 points of a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5339.517s">And</a>  then I have talked to councillors as Councilor Scarpelli did in neighboring communities and other communities around the state that have a hybrid ward council representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5350.301s">And</a>  there is a concern about competitiveness of running. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5355.523s">You</a>  have a lot of uncontested elections for ward seats and <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5362.257s">I</a>  think again, that's one of the main concerns in general with first past the post single member districts is essentially you have two people running against each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5370.461s">And,</a>  um, sometimes no one will run for that seat at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5375.844s">And</a>  you'll have an uncontested race right now in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5379.086s">I</a>  can't even remember the last time there was an uncontested race for city council, because I'm pretty sure all the elections in the past 20 years, there's been more than seven people running. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5388.251s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5392.207s">I've</a>  also heard some concerns about similar to what Councilor Scarpelli raised earlier that I think he, you know, he said those were his concerns before and he feels more alleviated by them from his discussions, but around prioritizing what's happening in one eighth of the city versus the whole city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5416.102s">And</a>  I've heard that as well as a concern from people who serve on bodies that have this type of representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5422.767s">So</a>  I believe that this proposal that I put forward moves us significantly towards local representation of neighborhoods of the city without going down to such a small district and maintaining more of a balance between at large <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5445.015s">and</a>  local representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5447.176s">So</a>  that's why I put this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5450.218s">I'm</a>  really interested to hear the thoughts of my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5454.12s">Certainly</a>  I'm happy to entertain amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5457.382s">And</a>  I would say that the, you know, the piece of this that I'm least concerned about is a bigger council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5465.747s">I'm</a>  not against a bigger council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5467.308s">I</a>  just am against a bigger council being formed exactly in this manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5471.651s">So</a>  I hope that we can have a discussion <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5474.429s">of</a>  a model that fits the goals that all of us are seeking and fits, quite frankly, the way that most legislative bodies are elected in most of the world and most of the country, which is not through most of them being elected in first-past-the-post single-member districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5497.638s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5501.928s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears for your comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5503.929s">I</a>  have Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5507.77s">Going</a>  to you, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5509.831s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5511.791s">As</a>  I, like I said, I really focused on really looking into this process because it was one of the pieces that really limited me from moving forward with the chattel review. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5525.396s">And</a>  now as we're seeing the <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5530.777s">The</a>  body that has worked on this, the professionals that have worked on this, and the committee that's gone out to the city and the community and worked diligently with the community have drafted a proposal that I think is what the community is asking for, the residents are asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5547.567s">I</a>  think I mentioned the key pieces that I think understanding the representation for all of our wards is so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5557.116s">I</a>  think when we talked about the ability for someone that's marginalized that might not have the opportunity to run at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5571.294s">having</a>  a better chance running an award, even running in the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5574.697s">So</a>  having a better representation, maybe seeing a council that looks a little different than we see today. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5580.081s">And</a>  I think that's what I've heard from council, from community members. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5583.784s">And</a>  I think that when we look at this and I looked across the state, I believe there's only three out of the whole state. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5590.81s">I</a>  believe there's only three, correct me if I'm wrong, but there's only three that have a seven body council when you look at this format. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5599.098s">I</a>  think what you see is a council of ward representation and at-large members. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5605.321s">And</a>  I think that's a huge involvement and openness and form of transparency, communication, and reachability to every corner of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5621.922s">So</a>  I think what the Charter Review Committee has put forth with the 11 members, I think it's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5629.307s">I</a>  think that that's something that I think the, tell me if I'm wrong, but the majority of the community has said to me, and this is why I know so much about it, because I was against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5639.935s">I</a>  was against ward representation completely. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5641.996s">So</a>  now when you sit and talk and the understanding of every single ward, imagine telling one ward they're not represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5647.841s">Okay,</a>  but no, no, the district, but it's not the ward. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5651.97s">And</a>  this is what we're seeing right now because we're the divide in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5655.953s">We</a>  do have a huge divide in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5657.854s">And</a>  one of those divides is people feeling that they don't, they're not listened to. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5662.937s">They're</a>  not, they don't have anybody that they feel they can go to. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5666.38s">And</a>  especially when you see the demographic method now, we have a lot of new method residents coming in that have grown up in communities that have ward representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5673.745s">So</a>  that comfort level is gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5674.925s">So</a>  they've eliminated themselves of being part of that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5678.397s">So</a>  I think we're seeing so many pieces that this fits. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5685.678s">And</a>  changing what is put forth I think would be a frightening thought because here's the piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5693.38s">We</a>  saw with the override question that this community was divided. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5699.461s">What</a>  we're seeing right now, what I'm hearing from both sides saying that this is something they like, it fits. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5706.102s">It's</a>  something that you meet, you can really go and I think this would be something that they could support and move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5711.246s">I</a>  will tell you the comments that I've heard from residents saying if we go to seven, doesn't that sound like and against conspiracy theory but unfortunately this community runs on. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5722.12s">Doesn't</a>  this sound like it's just an organization wanting to keep the numbers down so they can control this council? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5728.103s">And</a>  I'm not saying that it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5729.925s">I'm</a>  saying that this is the perception that goes out. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5733.347s">And</a>  this is where, when it comes down to a vote of charter change, charter review, and a vote, this is where we won't get the support. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5740.491s">Now,</a>  again, I say this publicly. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5743.192s">I</a>  don't believe in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5744.593s">But</a>  these are the questions that have been brought up that said, when we go to the vote, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5748.991s">let's</a>  give the city what they've been asking for, what the professionals have brought forward, what the committee that has worked so hard to go to every corner of the city and draft this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5761.497s">And</a>  I think that that's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5764.898s">When</a>  we look at the different compensation piece, I know we've held that off and we're gonna revisit that again, but I've listened to some community members that had said, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5777.143s">We're</a>  in fiscal crisis, we're having financial difficulties in Medford, even with 11 people, how would you correct it and say, well, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5783.525s">By</a>  moving toward representation, your schedule isn't as busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5789.126s">I'm</a>  not reaching out to every corner of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5792.787s">So</a>  maybe the compensation could be lowered because it would be less work in theory. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5798.549s">So</a>  I mean, there's so many pieces that you look at this and say, well, this is, it fits. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5804.675s">because</a>  ultimately what we want is we want this community to vote for it and support it and move forward to change what we need in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5811.699s">This</a>  is just a piece that I think is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5814.301s">You</a>  know, we've said it a thousand times, and every member here, I've heard it and I've seen it on the campaign trail, that really having a representation of a more diverse council, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5828.309s">What</a>  could support a more diverse council but getting people that are marginalized, giving them the opportunity <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5834.467s">to</a>  really control the opportunity to win a seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5841.27s">Not</a>  a bigger district, not a bigger community at large, but looking at a ward. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5846.512s">That's</a>  achievable for everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5849.593s">And</a>  I know I joked with Councilor Beaz earlier, but we're hearing it, you know, you wouldn't really have in our revolutions text Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5861.263s">I</a>  did get an email that they asked if I can read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5863.826s">And</a>  this is something that our revolution members put forth that many people voted for them because of this and that's what was said was our revolution metric advocates for transitions methods current at large electoral system. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5879.074s">to</a>  award-based representation model. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5881.375s">This</a>  change aims to ensure that each neighborhood has direct representation and the city government promoting equitable participation and addressing the unique needs of diverse communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5891.937s">And</a>  their 2023-24 method people platform, ORM, our revolution method, emphasizes the importance of the city charter reform to implement ward representation, therefore enhancing the inclusivity, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5908.552s">inclusivity</a>  and responsiveness of local governance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5912.395s">So</a>  I remind my colleagues that this is what you ran on. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5915.117s">This</a>  is your platform that you ran on. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5917.699s">And</a>  to come in today, this is what leaves the city divided. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5922.242s">This</a>  is what then comes in and says, you know what, then I know this committee did great. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5926.726s">We</a>  want to see some change, but you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5929.311s">It</a>  seems disingenuous, to be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5931.513s">So</a>  they sit back and say, what? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5932.753s">I'm</a>  not gonna vote for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5933.934s">And</a>  I'm gonna tell my families that are saying, well, instead of voting for the change of charter, why jeopardize this with something that works? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5941.099s">And</a>  maybe the call in Senate can prove me wrong, but there's a reason why we do 11, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5947.023s">There's</a>  eight members, every ward is represented, and then the three at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5952.807s">And</a>  correct me if I'm wrong, the majority, if not, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5957.988s">most</a>  of the state that has the ward representation has this form, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5966.83s">I</a>  mean, like I said, I thought there's only three that have such a limited district process. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5974.732s">So,</a>  and again, I urge my colleagues to follow the advice of the professionals, follow the advice of the people that have been in the streets in Medford, not nationally, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5986.611s">not</a>  different parts of the country, but in Medford, what they've done for their work to reach every corner of Medford that came out and said, let's do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=5996.922s">This</a>  is something that I feel strongly about, and I think that we should support this and leave it as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6001.627s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President, I mean, Mr. Chairperson.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6016.252s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6017.253s">I</a>  wanted to organize my thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6019.235s">So</a>  I wrote some stuff down that I wanted to talk about. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6022.237s">I've</a>  changed my mind back and forth on this issue a number of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6027.761s">When</a>  I was running for office, one of my primary issues was word-based representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6034.086s">I</a>  think it's really, really difficult for a new candidate to run for office across the whole city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6039.45s">It's</a>  really expensive. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6040.751s">It's</a>  really time consuming. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6043.253s">So</a>  it's hard when you have a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6044.414s">It's</a>  hard when you have a family. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6046.387s">to</a>  run for office for the first time in a city of 60,000 residents when you've never done it before. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6054.232s">It</a>  was very difficult to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6060.777s">I</a>  still believe that it would be easier to run in one ward than it would across the whole city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6066.12s">I</a>  think it would also be easier to run in two wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6069.262s">All</a>  of that being said, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6071.437s">The</a>  more I've looked at it and talked to residents and talked to members of the Charter Study Committee, it's becoming more clear to me that <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6090.987s">It's</a>  become clear to me that the work of the study committee has shown that the residents and the emails that I'm getting and the conversations that I'm having are telling me that the residents are interested in word based representation and that <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6104.423s">this</a>  would increase the number of city councillors significantly and would make our meetings which are already much too long, prohibitively too long, which is also a barrier for people running for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6116.565s">These</a>  meetings are a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6118.385s">Um</a>  and with 11 city councillors, they will be Way too long, and that is something else we will have to talk about, which is a rules change, which we have tried to implement and It hasn't changed very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6133.475s">These</a>  are things, these are all things to talk about, but if we want to make these roles accessible to our residents, all of these things need to be talked about together. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6143.122s">Medford</a>  is an outlier in a few ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6145.104s">Maybe</a>  one of the ways is that our city council is small. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6147.246s">Another</a>  one of the ways is that we do public participation on every agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6152.57s">When</a>  you do public participation on every agenda item, it makes your meetings very long. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6158.252s">That</a>  means that we are up in here until 11, 12, 1 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6161.876s">I</a>  have kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6164.158s">I</a>  have another job. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6165.599s">Everybody</a>  else has another job. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6167.781s">Many</a>  of us have kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6170.483s">We</a>  have things going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6171.644s">We</a>  have obligations at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6174.687s">So</a>  if there are 11 of us with no restrictions on city councilors talking and no limit to the time that we're here, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6184.401s">This</a>  is also a barrier to people running for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6187.644s">So</a>  when we talk about expanding the opportunities for people to be involved in their city government, we have to really talk about the actual barriers that people face. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6204.868s">Um,</a>  in order to increase diversity in our elected offices, we're not going to go to somebody's door in the ward where we know it's more diverse and knock on the doors, the people of color and the women and the queer people and say, Hey, we need you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6219.342s">You</a>  have to come do this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6221.276s">job</a>  that's really difficult, you have to stay up really late and get abused by the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6227.121s">You</a>  have to do it because that's your job. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6229.863s">It's</a>  not fair to do that to people. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6231.685s">It's</a>  not fair to ask that of people without protecting, to some degree, people that are serving in these roles. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6238.25s">So</a>  I think if we really care about having people come and be representatives and be involved in local government, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6248.921s">It's</a>  about much more than just what I think the Charter Study Committee and I also, when I was running as a candidate, came in with what we all did with a pure heart saying, let's open up this opportunity, which I still think that we probably should do. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6270.686s">Is</a>  our pure heartedness was to say, let's make this easier. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6277.948s">Let's</a>  also make it better. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6280.61s">Let's</a>  also pass the ordinances that make this a welcoming place. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6283.912s">Let's</a>  also make everything about City Hall accessible and genuinely good and safe for everyone, all of it together. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6295.401s">It</a>  doesn't happen just with one element falling into place, but with all of these elements coming in together at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6308.118s">I</a>  keep going back and forth because I feel very conflicted about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6312.24s">I</a>  think I will probably decide to support word-based representation based on the communications that I've had with people this week and last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6322.226s">But</a>  I would have a lot of thoughts about what would have to go along with that in order to make it feasible in my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6336.589s">I</a>  respect that this came from research and surveys and communications with the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6345.313s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6349.035s">I</a>  understand that.</p>

    <p>[Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6361.736s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6363.357s">I'd</a>  also just suggest as a potential compromise here, and I understand that this option wasn't really investigated too much by the Charter Study Committee, but having a 5-4 system, five at large, four district based as a possible in between option. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6386.968s">I</a>  can't make a motion for that, but I <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6391.73s">think</a>  it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6392.33s">I</a>  think that that would address some of the concerns with some of the words being too small and also expand the council, which I hear which I think a lot of residents have really been asking for. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6408.754s">I</a>  do agree with my colleagues on some of the <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6415.708s">issues</a>  with expanding the council, namely the length of meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6419.029s">So</a>  I would support a change to the council rules limiting individual councilor speaking times that would only go into effect after the expansion of the council, if that were the decision that this body ended up making. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6439.553s">That</a>  would be <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6441.249s">that</a>  those rules wouldn't necessarily go into the charter itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6445.11s">But</a>  I strongly believe that it would help to make meetings more efficient and keep a keep a cap on the time that these meetings end up going to. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6459.633s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6461.793s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Leming. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6463.773s">Councilor</a>  Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6464.553s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6467.214s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6469.831s">So</a>  I definitely am in favor of having a hybrid system that has some wards or districts and some at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6482.416s">To</a>  me, whether it is four districts, eight wards, each of our wards has two parts, that would be 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6491.2s">That</a>  to me is not as much of the question in terms of <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6496.656s">do</a>  we have boards or districts? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6498.317s">If</a>  we have four districts, we have eight wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6500.257s">To</a>  me, we are still using, like forming these more local elected offices, which I am in favor of. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6512.721s">I</a>  do definitely appreciate a lot of what President Bears has said about first past the post, single district. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6521.084s">Those</a>  genuinely are, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6524.971s">not</a>  the greatest way to elect people, not necessarily the best representation of democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6533.474s">They</a>  also lead to long incumbencies because it is far more difficult to oust an incumbent. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6546.558s">I</a>  was very curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6548.219s">I</a>  know that in Massachusetts, we do <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6552.715s">We</a>  are a little bit of an outlier currently, especially with seven at large, but also in terms of the number of city councilors that we have for the size of our population. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6564.802s">And</a>  I was really curious to look outside of Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6569.325s">And</a>  if I could share my screen.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6570.766s">That</a>  might have to be from the clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6580.953s">Oh,</a>  there we go.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6582.077s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6583.418s">I'm</a>  sorry that this is so small. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6586.661s">And</a>  this should only be, hang on. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6593.406s">I</a>  only wanna share that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6594.828s">Let</a>  me see if I can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6600.613s">This</a>  is the one I picked, but it didn't, oh, I see. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6602.374s">Oh,</a>  okay, great. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6612.922s">Okay,</a>  so what I did was I went ahead and I looked at other states and other cities, and I mean, I literally just went to Chattopiti, and I asked Chattopiti, please give me 10 cities in New England that are around 60,000 population. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6635.668s">And</a>  I said, please give me 10 cities in the South. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6637.829s">I</a>  said, please give me 10 cities in the West, 10 cities in the Midwest, and I just, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6643.05s">Like,</a>  you know, there was no picking of which cities these were. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6647.633s">These</a>  are, I believe, a quite random sampling. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6652.076s">And</a>  they're all, you know, somewhere around 60,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6655.378s">And</a>  I looked just to have an understanding of other states and other cities that aren't Massachusetts, and how many city councilors they have per population. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6670.047s">So</a>  there's a range. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6672.783s">I</a>  think population per city council ranges from about 4,000 to about 15,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6679.347s">There's</a>  a lot of, you know, there's a big range. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6684.469s">There's</a>  a large, there's wards or districts, and there's a lot of hybrid. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6690.312s">There</a>  are a few that are purely wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6693.474s">And</a>  what I thought was interesting is that at the number seven, and this has, I think it ended up with 48, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6701.589s">because</a>  there was one that was 99,000, I got rid of that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6705.572s">So</a>  there's 48 listed here and we just so happen in population per city councilor to rank 24th, which is exactly in the center. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6715.839s">And</a>  again, this is a pretty random sampling of cities that are close to 60,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6722.084s">So</a>  I just wanted to sort of provide that as what I think is <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6727.621s">know,</a>  looking, it includes some in Massachusetts as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6732.245s">And</a>  Massachusetts does tend to have far larger city councils per population than other states. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6741.033s">Maybe</a>  we want to be more like other cities, maybe we think that other states and cities in the country also understand how to do a democracy. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6750.182s">I</a>  personally don't <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6752.045s">have</a>  an opinion either way. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6753.246s">I</a>  don't think that Massachusetts is necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6756.248s">The</a>  way we do things is necessarily better. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6758.27s">I</a>  don't think the way other states do it is necessarily better. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6761.312s">But</a>  I just thought it was interesting to kind of take a look at a random sampling of cities across the country that have approximately our population and what their size of city council is and also what their sort of composition is. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6774.662s">So</a>  I just wanted to provide that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6775.523s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6777.695s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6779.877s">In</a>  the order I saw, President Bears, Vice President Collins, and then Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6789.052s">Thank</a>  you, and I appreciate that information as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6794.355s">It's</a>  good to see, and two of the examples I saw in there were Revere and Weymouth, and you had a much more balanced distribution of at-large and district Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6804.22s">Weymouth,</a>  I saw in there six, I believe six district five at-large, or maybe it was six at-large, five district, but again, right. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6813.544s">And</a>  again, district, not ward. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6817.054s">I</a>  want to make a point that this is local representation, the proposal that I put forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6824.861s">We</a>  had a survey that went out that asked about one way that that could look, and people said we'd like a hybrid between local representation and an at-large. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6835.691s">We</a>  didn't ask about a number of other ways that that could have been formulated, and we don't know what the survey would have said. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6843.43s">other</a>  than to say that the survey said they want a hybrid of more local representation and at large representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6850.034s">People</a>  did not want to stay at all at large, by and large, although I think some percentage did. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6855.438s">People</a>  did not want all local representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6858.78s">They</a>  wanted some form in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6861.722s">And</a>  this proposal maintains that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6865.364s">I</a>  think it, I've seen a bunch of people who are very anti our revolution, Medford, who say we should stay at all at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6872.968s">You</a>  know, I've seen a number of people who feel differently about that from different political persuasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6879.993s">I</a>  don't think this is about politics in the most base sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6885.377s">I</a>  think people have a lot of different opinions about how this should look. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6888.46s">But</a>  again, my principle that I have said since I started running, a principle of the Our Revolution Mentored Platform was more local representation and not just having at large representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6900.889s">And</a>  I stand fully with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6905.063s">And</a>  again, another one was about more diversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6910.325s">The</a>  demographics difference between the ward, going to all eight and doing four districts was not really statistically significant demographic difference in that makeup. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6924.549s">The</a>  idea of a five at large four district, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6927.855s">fine</a>  with that, too, if making the priority being a larger council, which I know the Charter Study Committee noted, and Chair McDonald has noted online, that having a larger council would make more sense in terms of our comparable communities in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6947.619s">I'm</a>  not against that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6949.299s">I</a>  just proposed what was proposed for the school committee in the Charter Study Committee's recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6954.481s">And</a>  my main concern remains having more of a balance than three to eight of essentially a giant multi-member district for three councilors, which is a more fair way of electing people, and eight single district first past the post elections, which may in fact countervail our priorities for more diversity and more representation if we end up with <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6979.988s">people</a>  incumbents winning those elections and sitting in those seats for 20 years unchallenged because that happens a lot in communities that have a lot of small districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6991.454s">And</a>  again, I just want to note the other point that I made earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=6996.851s">If</a>  we have a bunch of small districts, given the traditional turnout in this community, we're devaluing certain votes and highly more valuing other votes in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7007.194s">And</a>  I think the district model proposed, whether it's three at large and four district or five at large and four district, it's a better balance between the two. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7016.476s">It</a>  avoids some of the pitfalls of having votes weighted so differently against each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7025.888s">And</a>  I just think it would serve the community better. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7028.071s">That's</a>  why I propose this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7029.132s">It's</a>  my basic principle of why I propose literally everything I ever do here. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7033.318s">So</a>  to anyone who may question that for whatever purpose, you're wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7039.265s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7042.209s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli, give me a sec.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7051.802s">It's</a>  not Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7053.925s">Oh,</a>  sorry, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7054.826s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7059.066s">Thank</a>  you, Chair Sine, I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7062.469s">I</a>  really appreciate the discussion on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7065.631s">So</a>  far, I know that this is, you know, we come to this discussion after months of work and outreach and diligence and research by the members of the Charter Study Committee and the Collins Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7076.44s">And</a>  I just want to, again, state how much I appreciate all of that hard work and that collaboration so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7086.761s">So</a>  my thoughts on this issue, again, going to restate some of what was already said by my fellow Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7093.223s">Of</a>  course, we could see from the data that respondents who did respond to the survey favored ward-based representation when compared to all at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7104.346s">I</a>  do think that it is significant that district based and other models were not given as options for comparison. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7111.349s">That's</a>  not a criticism. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7112.67s">It's</a>  just simply that I don't think that that means that this council should have this discussion as though those options are not also on the table because we have a responsibility to do our due diligence and make amendments or approve. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7126.095s">or</a>  approve the proposal based on what we think will be best for the long-term future of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7134.021s">My</a>  bottom line is I think that the proposed amendment regarding composition still represents a very, very big improvement towards more localized representation, making representation much more localized than it has been in a very, very long time, perhaps ever. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7146.45s">I</a>  know <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7151.504s">I</a>  think we all know, we all concur that running in a smaller pool in some ways reduces the barriers to running for office, especially financially. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7160.153s">You</a>  have to fundraise less. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7161.455s">Fundraising</a>  is very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7164.298s">But</a>  I don't think that we should discuss this as if that is the whole story. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7170.004s">to</a>  improving representation and making representation more proportional to demographics. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7176.389s">I</a>  don't think that ward-based representation is a panacea. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7180.151s">I</a>  certainly don't think that it's a panacea for making marginalized populations more equitably represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7185.195s">I</a>  think that for us to pursue that as though it's a silver bullet, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7192.27s">would</a>  be a misguided reason to pursue a ward-based representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7197.636s">Running</a>  is inherently difficult for millions of reasons, and I do believe that it will take decades or more to truly equalize the playing field. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7204.843s">And</a>  I think my bottom line on this is that wards do not deserve simple representation full stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7210.289s">What</a>  wards deserve is compelling and competitive elections each and every time. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7215.434s">And</a>  I have concerns that the proposal that we're currently looking at from the Charter Study Committee, I'm very concerned that those elections would not result in compelling and competitive elections each and every time. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7230.966s">My</a>  research has indicated to me that in quite small wards like we have in Medford, the pool of candidates tends to be very small. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7238.872s">It's</a>  very common for incumbents to go unchallenged. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7242.454s">And</a>  for incumbents, when they do decide that they want to retire from those elected positions, to privately appoint a successor, put off their announcement until the last moment, which all but ensures that other challenges do not have the time to jump in the race and have a real shot at participating in that competitive election. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7262.18s">And</a>  I don't think that that is democratic. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7263.641s">I</a>  don't think that that is our shared goal for more competitive and more locally representative offices. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7273.655s">Lastly,</a>  I'll just say, you know, I know that this is this is a big deal because this is the guiding document for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7279.719s">And</a>  hopefully I am really confident that we will arrive at a document that all of us can feel, you know, like any product of compromise that we can all feel a little bit good about and a little bit wistful about. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7289.506s">But</a>  as city councilors, it is our responsibility to apply our perspective and our good faith opinions to this process, even in perhaps especially when it's unpopular. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7301.434s">It's</a>  certainly <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7304.083s">It's</a>  certainly more politically expedient to do what is popular, but our job is to research and advance what we think would be best for the community in the long run, regardless of the impact on us as individual electeds and individual future candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7319.129s">And</a>  that's the reason for my opinion on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7323.211s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7325.832s">Thank</a>  you, President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7327.433s">I</a>  got Councilor Scarpelli and then Councilor Callahan, Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7334.275s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7335.877s">And</a>  again, I look at this presentation as something very important for the goal of this initiative being strong enough that the voters will pass and support what we bring forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7354.433s">What</a>  we've done is we've had the opportunity for a group of people to go out and get the information from the people. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7362.505s">Then</a>  we brought in the professionals from the Collins Center to support and guide. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7369.509s">And</a>  this is what's come out. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7372.53s">I've</a>  heard some of my colleagues look at this, and I've got to be very honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7377.252s">We</a>  say it's not political, but I hear a lot of double talk. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7381.495s">I'm</a>  actually sitting back shocked that I'm saying, I can't believe that I'm saying what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7386.977s">And</a>  I'm hearing this from the people on your own platform <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7390.908s">that</a>  you've said, quote unquote, like directly, that the importance of a city charter reform is implementing award representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7404.035s">I'm</a>  just confused because it seems like a lot of you are backpedaling for the platform that you were elected to. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7410.778s">And</a>  at the same time, when it fit that dialogue, you've also said, well, these are the people that I knocked on their doors. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7418.56s">And</a>  those people, I have to support them. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7421.184s">So</a>  I have to push that agenda through, even though sometimes it's not best for the whole community, but these are the people that helped you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7427.392s">You've</a>  said it and elected you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7429.014s">Now,</a>  maybe you could say it's not true, but I'll say it over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7432.679s">The</a>  power of video is amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7437.396s">These</a>  are things you've said and done. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7438.697s">I</a>  didn't pull this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7439.418s">I</a>  had a member of the revolution send this to me who didn't want to jeopardize their name or their friendship with some of you that said that they're very difficult to see this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7450.566s">I</a>  have some counsel saying that the difficult about this is really running the meeting and being organized. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7458.192s">Well,</a>  that's not the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7460.137s">That's</a>  our city council rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7463.098s">That's</a>  our policies we can change. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7464.618s">I'll</a>  tell you one, and I can go to the meeting video as well, that when the council voted five to two to eliminate meetings every Tuesday night, and Councilor Caraviello and myself voted against it, the councilor that's here tonight mentioned that if we see it's not working, then we'll go back to the every Tuesday meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7483.481s">Because</a>  I hear that as a problem, because the meetings are running longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7487.334s">And</a>  it seems like the message is being muddied, or it's taking too long. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7493.499s">Well,</a>  that's a city council rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7495.661s">That's</a>  not a charter rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7498.403s">I've</a>  heard a councilor tonight talk about, well, imagine this, some of the wards are too small, so they don't need representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7507.551s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7509.132s">Well,</a>  a fellow councilor said that there are some of the wards, we could play it back, but some of the wards are so small, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7516.998s">that</a>  we maybe might not need ward representation in such small wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7521.86s">I</a>  wrote it by word. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7524.441s">And</a>  then you hear, we're looking from the improvement, it's better than what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7531.083s">I'm</a>  hearing council say it's better what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7533.184s">Is</a>  that what we're here to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7534.645s">Just</a>  to get better or fix what's been wrong here. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7539.927s">And</a>  again, this is coming from a place where I was against it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7544.356s">Now</a>  I feel like I'm standing on an island saying, am I hearing myself? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7550.359s">We've</a>  been praising Mrs. McDonald and her group and how hard they've been. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7554.821s">And</a>  they've gone, they went out and talked to Medford residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7558.223s">They</a>  want to see Medford results. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7560.564s">They</a>  want to see this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7562.405s">The</a>  professionals at Collins Center said, this is what works. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7565.787s">And</a>  then we have Councilors bringing up numbers from Wyoming and California showing us numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7573.233s">Who</a>  cares? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7574.593s">We</a>  don't know their breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7577.614s">I'm</a>  worried about Medford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7579.755s">And</a>  from what I gather, there are only three communities in the state of Massachusetts with this form of government that only look at district representation or such a small representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7592.259s">And</a>  then the biggest piece that we've said over and over again, and it sounds like because it doesn't fit the narrative, we're avoiding it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7600.901s">This</a>  will give us a more diverse community council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7604.802s">Of</a>  course it will. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7606.943s">Well,</a>  we have a slow turnout. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7608.863s">Well,</a>  imagine if we have an award representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7613.224s">Have</a>  we seen, maybe the Collins Center can help us. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7616.205s">When</a>  you see organizations go from at large to award representations, I'm assuming that voter turnout will be larger because now, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7627.358s">you</a>  have people that are identifying certain groups and certain people that will then run. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7632.181s">With</a>  the ward representation being that you don't have to encompass yourself throughout the whole community, time-wise, or raise enough money to run at large, we're giving our, or even a district, we're giving our residents an opportunity to be part of this great option and be a voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7650.913s">So</a>  I know it sounds critical and maybe I'm attacking, but <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7655.222s">This</a>  isn't anything that my fellow councils haven't said in meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7660.046s">And</a>  here I am coming back and saying, am I in a bizarro world? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7665.751s">And</a>  I'll say this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7667.412s">We're</a>  trying to pass a piece of legislation here that will go out that the city is gonna vote on. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7677.901s">This</a>  is something that's popular. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7680.043s">This</a>  is something that everybody I talked to on both sides, it didn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7686.049s">They</a>  appreciate the ward representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7687.809s">They</a>  appreciate that all eight wards will be represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7692.47s">That's</a>  something they can go to the election booth in November and vote in support. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7700.992s">Why</a>  would we now finally get to the finish line and try to honestly look like you're trying to control it? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7708.654s">Because</a>  that's what it sounds like. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7709.674s">Look,</a>  this is what it sounds like. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7711.214s">It</a>  sounds like you want seven people so you can control it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7714.602s">because</a>  when you open it to 11 people, maybe you don't, you lose the majority. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7721.226s">So</a>  that's the disrespect that happens time and time with this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7725.369s">Listen,</a>  there are things that I don't, I don't like my fellow council say, but I would never disrespect and openly laugh like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7732.053s">This</a>  is what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7733.194s">This</a>  is what we have at this council day after evening after evening when, when my fellow council is the chair of this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7739.698s">So</a>  again, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7740.896s">This</a>  isn't anything that I made up. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7743.476s">I</a>  just explained what my fellow Councilors just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7748.337s">I</a>  just reiterated what my fellow Councilors have said in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7751.778s">I</a>  just read a passage from the people's platform of our revolution that this council all ran on a slate, that they preached and ran on ward representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7761.72s">I</a>  didn't make this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7764.68s">So</a>  I know you're angry because it doesn't fit what you just presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7771.09s">and</a>  it might not go your way, but let's look at the big picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7776.393s">We</a>  want this passed now. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7779.575s">And</a>  as one council that understands, and you look at the full picture now and do your homework and understand it and really not be angry at what I've lived through and say, have an open mind and look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7793.384s">And</a>  I've had that open mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7794.404s">It's</a>  allowed me to talk to a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7797.927s">And</a>  the eight wards being represented with the three out loud members is something that I would support. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7805.633s">It's</a>  something that the professionals from the call center support. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7809.275s">And</a>  it's what the people that have gone meeting after meeting throughout the whole community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7815.46s">And</a>  I know because they've called me a thousand times getting input from neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7824.448s">When</a>  we talk about let the people speak, I think the people, it was clear, it's right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7830.192s">Now</a>  this is being put forth by a Councilor for truly, I'll be honest with you, I don't see the weight in your presentation of why seven or district representation has been more beneficial than a true ward representation of all of our whole community.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7852.745s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7856.435s">Before</a>  I move to Councilor Callahan, I see a lot more hands raised here. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7861.457s">I</a>  just wanted to correct the record on some things. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7865.398s">And</a>  I'm not saying I agree or disagree with this proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7868.159s">I'm</a>  still considering different perspectives. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7871.94s">On</a>  the quote from the Medford People's Platform, I could not actually find that exact quote. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7877.061s">What</a>  I did find instead was, we commit to implementing a city charter review process to change and expand the way <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7882.463s">Medford</a>  elected officials to ward representation instead of just at-large seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7887.465s">And</a>  I think it's important not to leave out that last operative clause. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7894.088s">There</a>  are things said about what councilor said, what I do think there is a difference between saying that board representation is not the best way to serve a district, which is what I think the councilor was saying instead of that <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7907.803s">Ward</a>  doesn't deserve representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7910.186s">Those</a>  are two very different statements. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7912.729s">With</a>  regards to the meeting times, I did actually do, I looked at the data about it, and when you take the meetings since 2020 that are more substantive rather than procedural, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7930.118s">are</a>  actually, after we went bi-weekly, our meeting lengths are pretty much exactly the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7936.321s">Only</a>  six minutes longer on average under the bi-weekly system. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7940.543s">So</a>  there's not a lot of difference there. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7944.544s">And</a>  I believe the call-in center is here to answer our questions and not to advocate for any particular policy or choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7950.967s">Although</a>  we do have members of the Charter Study Committee who are here to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7956.73s">Councilor</a>  Callahan, Lazzaro, and then <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7960.53s">saw</a>  President Bears and then Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7966.453s">Also,</a>  I understand that there are people here for public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7969.795s">We</a>  will get to that.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7970.535s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7972.596s">I</a>  just want to note first that I independently also <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7980.312s">came</a>  up with a thought of what Councilor Leming suggested, which was for the four districts plus five at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7986.115s">So</a>  I thought it was amusing that you independently came up with that idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7989.637s">I</a>  also am fine with a larger city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=7996.641s">And</a>  then I just wanted to say that I'm not on this committee, and I so appreciate the opportunity to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8005.526s">I</a>  will not be able to vote today. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8007.007s">I</a>  do actually have another appointment, and so I will be leaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8011.971s">But</a>  thank you all so much for your incredibly thoughtful comments and proposals. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8023.241s">I,</a>  for one, genuinely believe that everyone here is doing their absolute best to come up with <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8034.242s">what</a>  is going to be the best for Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8038.544s">Not</a>  slightly better. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8041.085s">I</a>  think there are, I think we should listen to what councilors say. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8046.948s">We</a>  should take what they say as what they mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8051.031s">And</a>  I certainly, when I do have an opportunity to vote in the city council meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8058.8s">I</a>  will be voting for the thing that I believe is the best possible charter that we can have for the best representation in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8067.883s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8074.084s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8075.085s">Now</a>  recognizing Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8079.506s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8080.006s">I</a>  just wanted to, as a point of information, correct something that was said earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8084.907s">It</a>  may have been missed because <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8089.325s">One</a>  of my colleagues got up and walked around while I was talking, but I was trying to address some of the nuance to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8098.19s">I</a>  like ward representation and I will be voting for ward representation, but it is nuanced and complicated and it doesn't automatically equal a more diverse council and it doesn't automatically mean <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8116.379s">that</a>  everything is solved. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8117.78s">And</a>  I think that it will require a lot of work from all of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8122.625s">And</a>  that is what I was trying to communicate. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8124.366s">I</a>  will be I think I will be voting for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8129.992s">And</a>  I'm just I think that we deserve our that our residents deserve <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8137.641s">and</a>  open and honest discussion of the nuance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8140.204s">And</a>  I don't begrudge the Charter Study Committee for not presenting the public with like 14 different options for ways to organize government that are not commonly done in America. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8154.487s">I</a>  think it would have been great if we could have tried that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8158.45s">But</a>  I also think that it's rational to not. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8161.873s">So</a>  this is what we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8164.375s">Another</a>  thing I want to draw attention to is that there is a section of the charter draft that we have, which is Article 9, the general provisions 9.1 <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8174.428s">mentions</a>  charter changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8176.208s">This</a>  charter may be replaced, revised, or amended in accordance with any procedure made available under the state constitution or by the general laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8182.11s">And</a>  then there's another section about periodic review of the charter that mentions every 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8186.131s">You</a>  can go back and review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8187.211s">I</a>  don't think it's necessary that we wait 40 years in between reviewing the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8193.952s">We</a>  can try something. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8196.633s">We</a>  can review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8197.513s">It</a>  should be reviewed every 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8200.253s">This</a>  draft says, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8202.981s">review</a>  it every 10 years and every 10 years thereafter, like after 10 years and 10 years thereafter, if it's not, if there's something that happens that occurs with a model that we try, it can be reviewed and changed, it's written in. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8216.226s">I</a>  think that is much better than what happened the last time around and <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8225.553s">I</a>  think we have observed in this country some of the drawbacks to a lot of the models for government that we've tried. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8235.538s">There</a>  are obviously a lot of problems with elections in this country, a lot of problems with our legislative bodies. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8243.942s">And</a>  it can be really frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8246.823s">And</a>  I'm not sure that we can solve all of the issues right now in Medford, but I <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8255.246s">What</a>  I feel I've been presented with is a clear preference from the public for what was offered by the Charter Study Committee in this respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8272.953s">I</a>  agree that the district option is a greater recommendation <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8281.615s">opportunity</a>  for representation than what we have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8286.417s">But</a>  since every communication I've received from a member of the public, almost every communication I've received has said, I would like to see eight ward based Councilors plus three at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8300.764s">I</a>  think that's what I have to say that I will support.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8307.988s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8310.209s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8310.749s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro, I think I have President Bears and then Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8316.973s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8317.433s">I</a>  just want to be very clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8319.254s">I'm</a>  not worried about the politics or the elections of any of these models. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8326.378s">And</a>  I'm quite frankly, really sick of the politicization and the putting words in people's mouth that happens on this council by my colleague. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8340.323s">I</a>  mean, we're having a discussion about what is a model that would work best for the community? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8347.827s">What</a>  do we think gets us the best long-term outcomes in terms of good governance for this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8353.41s">It's</a>  not about winning an election. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8354.871s">Who's</a>  gonna win this election? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8356.032s">Who's</a>  gonna win that election? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8358.133s">It's</a>  not about saying that Matt thinks some words don't matter when he never said that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8362.896s">It's</a>  not about, you know, you're quoting a platform I helped to write. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8369.585s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8370.225s">And</a>  you're not quoting it in good faith. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8372.867s">It</a>  says, I understand what's under you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8374.367s">I've</a>  read it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8374.928s">I</a>  wrote it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8375.648s">I</a>  helped to write it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8377.009s">And</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8377.789s">And</a>  it said, this is a version of word representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8383.712s">It's</a>  a version of word representation that will be the school committee will have. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8388.074s">That's</a>  what I'm proposing. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8390.172s">And</a>  I laugh when I laugh because the absurdity of completely misreading and misstating what I've said and what other Councilors have said and what has been written down is just beyond the pale of having a respectful dialogue in this body. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8407.158s">I</a>  support a new charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8410.219s">If</a>  this discussion goes the way it seems like it's going, I support a new charter, but the way that it had to get here and the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8418.252s">the</a>  things that had to be brought up to try to spin it and tweak it and turn it in that way is just so beyond disappointing and beyond frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8427.422s">Because</a>  again, the data, who cares, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8433.829s">We</a>  said, who cares about data? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8436.753s">I</a>  care about data. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8439.306s">and</a>  the data shows that we would be on the very small end, not just of Massachusetts, but of the country in terms of if we go to word-based representation, Councilors per population. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8450.276s">I</a>  think that's an important data point. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8452.758s">I</a>  think the data point that's been raised about the fact that it, whether it's district or ward, doesn't affect the racial demographics of the districts, but does affect the fact that you might end up with <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8464.727s">uh,</a>  you know, long term incumbencies in very small districts or some people winning award seat with 2500 votes and some people winning award seat with 750 votes and then saying, so does that mean that some voters matter less than some voters matter more? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8479.0s">That's</a>  just a data point. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8482.082s">I'm</a>  very confident in the ability of everyone here to win elections because we've done it many times. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8488.648s">I</a>  think we could have <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8490.308s">and</a>  all at large model and win elections and all ward model and win elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8494.371s">But</a>  I just can't stand when the words are being put in our mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8500.535s">So</a>  it's just really frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8503.477s">Another</a>  thing that we talked about was, do we want to fix what's been wrong or do we want to make things better? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8509.24s">I</a>  don't want to make things worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8511.822s">And</a>  the reason that I put this forward is that I in good faith think that there's a way that the way that this is written out makes things worse. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8520.251s">I</a>  would support a 15-person city council with seven at-large and eight wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8525.475s">That's</a>  ward representation and an even number of at-large seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8529.758s">My</a>  biggest concern is having a ward-based representation of all eight wards as individual wards with only three at-large city councilors brings in some of the worst practices of elected government in this country and in the state and ruins and takes out some of the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8549.672s">That's</a>  my issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8550.773s">I</a>  think more balance between those two things is a good thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8555.877s">I</a>  don't think at this point that this is going to be well considered, but I'd be willing to do another survey with a few more models and see what people actually support. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8565.123s">Cause</a>  I don't think we really know. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8566.945s">And</a>  I don't think we've had a conversation about all of the costs and benefits of making these choices. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8573.209s">That's</a>  why I put forward what I put forward for no other reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8577.533s">And</a>  I really, really resent <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8580.097s">the</a>  implication to the contrary. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8581.998s">And</a>  I think quite frankly, that bringing all of the politics into this is what poisoned it and will poison it in either direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8590.562s">So</a>  I really hope that that's something we can get away from on this council as it continues under this form or any other form, because <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8603.888s">This</a>  is a good faith conversation based on data and principles. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8606.75s">And</a>  when we bring in all this other stuff that nobody brought up except to malign their colleagues, it just leaves a horrible taste in my mouth. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8616.998s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8634.148s">You</a>  know, I would love to get back to a place where this conversation is productive and civil, like it was at the beginning of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8641.01s">But</a>  first, I do have to say, I find it a little rich that one Councilor will start the meeting talking about maturing and being open minded. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8648.312s">And</a>  then the instant that their colleagues start to disagree with them, the conversation turns to personal attacks and blaming colleagues for rending the city apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8656.114s">I</a>  just wish that we could have civil and productive conversations about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8659.895s">and</a>  I don't think that's productive. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8661.857s">I'm</a>  really respectful to the conversation at all, not after all of the work that has been put into this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8667.441s">No</a>  one said that some wards do not need representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8669.883s">What</a>  was said, not by me, is that some wards are so low turnout and some wards are so high turnout that it would create a huge disparity in some residents' votes among others, counting some very, very highly, and other votes would matter much less numerically, and that's not fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8687.657s">I</a>  don't think that we should be trading one form of unrepresentativeness for another. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8691.399s">And</a>  if we're going to, I at least think that we should be able to acknowledge it and acknowledge that it matters and talk about potential mitigating solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8702.244s">I</a>  hope that people will take it to heart that I am willing to potentially disagree with people with whom I share values because I have honest concerns about the current charter provisions as proposed, and I am willing to face criticism over that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8717.19s">I</a>  simply think that we should prioritize genuine representation and genuine efficacy over well-intentioned, but I think less effective, appearances of representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8727.86s">And</a>  I don't think that we can accomplish that by simply adding numbers to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8731.523s">And</a>  for reasons that have already been stated by me and by others, I don't think that the simple ward-based system is the best way of doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8739.94s">I</a>  know that we have received a lot of feedback about the award-based versus all-at-large options. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8745.942s">Again,</a>  I think that we need to consider that these were the only two options presented in the survey, and we should consider those data points in the context of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8753.145s">There</a>  weren't other data points on the table or on the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8758.537s">Something</a>  that guides all of my decisions on the council is knowing that people, all people, myself included, it's human nature to overly weight feedback that is visible to us, like opinions that we happen to have heard, people that we happen to have heard from, and forget that other opinions that we happen to happen to have heard, that we didn't ask for, that are not as visible, that didn't hear about a survey, that don't have opportunities to come to city council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8782.885s">It's</a>  human nature to overweight the information that we have heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8786.946s">and</a>  kind of forget that other information exists. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8790.849s">I</a>  bring this up not just because for me it is a really useful reminder when I'm making any decision on the City Council, but also because I think it's incredibly relevant to this project, because the work of the City Charter, especially talking about composition, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8805.54s">is</a>  about better representation for those people in the community who are not as visible, who don't have access to our normal communication channels, who don't know how to get in contact with their city councilors, who do not vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8818.932s">To</a>  me, that is the goal of this section of the city charter, is try to get better at that exact mechanism. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8826.67s">I</a>  believe that a district model is our best option for lifting up and better representing people who are currently underrepresented, even in light of the feedback that we have seen, which was based on the two options presented in the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8839.157s">And</a>  I think it's very relevant that this is a project that has been worked on by people who are highly involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8845.26s">And</a>  it's our job to approve a product that will work the best and the most fairly for people who are already highly involved and for people who have not been able to be highly involved, for people who are underrepresented. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8856.915s">All</a>  that being said, I do think that this is a good moment for compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8861.59s">I</a>  think that a lot of good points have been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8865.817s">I've</a>  been very clear that I think that the district-based model makes the most sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8869.618s">I'm</a>  also not opposed to a larger council, not at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8874.159s">It's</a>  not my preference, but I'm not opposed to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8876.959s">Councilor</a>  Leming earlier entertained the idea of sticking with four district councilors, but expanding the number to five at-large councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8885.781s">I</a>  would be happy to offer that in the form of a motion to President Bierer's proposed amendments if he is willing to accept it as a friendly amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8896.183s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8898.244s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins, Councilor Scarpelli, and then Councilor Bears.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8905.185s">Mr.</a>  Chair, to my colleague that referenced the Council that got up and walked out while she was speaking, I want to apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8913.187s">I've</a>  been sick, so I ran out of water and I felt a little faint, so I had to go get water. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8920.27s">So</a>  I apologize if I disrespected any member of the council to get water. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8924.871s">So</a>  I apologize for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8927.412s">For</a>  my colleagues that seem to be offended that I'm bringing politics into politics, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8935.514s">But</a>  I don't align with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8939.755s">You</a>  are a slate of six that vote in tow. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8943.456s">You</a>  usually vote in tow, but you all vote together. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8946.975s">on</a>  your agendas. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8948.276s">And</a>  that's known. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8949.137s">That's</a>  nothing that's a secret. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8950.918s">I'm</a>  trying to attack anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8953.02s">But</a>  my position as a city councilor is to be the voice that people call or express a concern or the way they feel or they want to be represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8964.689s">So</a>  when I bring a topic forward, if it hurts your feelings, I'll do respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8969.332s">I</a>  don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8971.794s">My</a>  goal is to make sure that everybody's view is represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8978.14s">So</a>  I know my council colleagues are upset or feel hurt or the reason that I disrespected them. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=8987.446s">I'm</a>  just sharing what has been brought to my attention by constituents that I'm expressing it night after night, because it seems like I'm the only one because some people just aren't listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9000.315s">And</a>  this is why our community is in flux right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9003.978s">So</a>  when we look at this situation right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9006.866s">where</a>  we are right now, the council brought up some changes and supported it, some with facts, some with his own beliefs, his belief system, which I respect. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9020.233s">That's</a>  his belief system. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9022.574s">That's</a>  his due diligence looking forward in his decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9025.816s">Myself,</a>  I looked at it totally opposite, but I will not, I will not apologize to share <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9036.96s">what</a>  has been asked of me by constituents, maybe constituents that don't even vote for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9044.825s">So</a>  my personal opinion and my motion is we stay with the original presentation by the Charter Review Committee with the 11 representatives, eight board, three at large, and again, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9064.588s">we</a>  can look back at this tape and listen to what everybody has said and what I expressed from what they said. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9071.93s">This</a>  isn't made up. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9074.831s">This</a>  isn't a dialogue to make this like some kind of a clown show. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9080.012s">This</a>  is an expression of one council's view in comparison to six others. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9087.074s">And</a>  I will not apologize for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9090.756s">And</a>  unfortunately, my friends, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9093.452s">This</a>  is politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9095.794s">This</a>  isn't, hey, kumbaya, let's all sit together and say, let's all do this, let's run together and let's have one vision and make Medford what we believe in. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9104.1s">No,</a>  because that's not how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9105.681s">It's</a>  a very different complex world we live in in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9110.225s">And</a>  the thing that people come back for over and over again is they feel that this council isn't listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9118.651s">And</a>  all I'm saying is, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9120.758s">We</a>  have a committee that's worked their tails off months after months, night after night, getting the information that presented to the professionals and that presented to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9133.949s">And</a>  all I'm saying is the belief of a council making a change and my beliefs from what I've heard from constituents or my personal belief and understanding is that the ward representation of all eight wards are represented. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9153.297s">and</a>  to throw in pieces like, well, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9156.358s">They'll</a>  be there forever, or not enough people will come out in that ward, 2,500 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9164.502s">That's</a>  the way of the world. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9165.963s">This</a>  is how we work through things. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9168.344s">To</a>  say that we won't have enough people, not enough people come out and vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9171.445s">Well,</a>  maybe these are the changes that will bring our constituents out to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9174.866s">Make</a>  them feel like they're part of the solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9177.247s">Have</a>  them feel vested. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9179.168s">Make</a>  them feel part of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9185.17s">So</a>  again, thank you for allowing me to speak.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9192.656s">President</a>  Bears and then Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9195.698s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9199.661s">No</a>  one is asking my colleague to apologize for what he believes or for his position on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9207.747s">Specific</a>  things were said that were then mischaracterized to make a point. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9214.871s">and</a>  I don't take your words and then say, oh, you actually said this other thing that you didn't say. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9223.017s">That's</a>  the only thing that frustrates me here. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9227.72s">That's</a>  why, I mean, I didn't say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9229.702s">It's</a>  not about anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9233.985s">I</a>  don't think you should believe what you should believe or be able to say, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9240.983s">But</a>  I do think that saying that another member of this council said that some words don't matter when he didn't say that is just beyond the pale. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9253.191s">I</a>  also want to say that we have a statutory role in this process as members of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9261.937s">There</a>  were many times I can think of many votes and I appreciate that councilor Scarpelli's mind has changed on this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9269.488s">where</a>  a lot of people came up to this podium and said, we think this is what's best for the community to have a charter change. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9274.813s">We</a>  need a charter review process. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9276.194s">We</a>  need this council to pass a home rule petition so that we can elect a charter commission and do a charter change. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9281.739s">And</a>  all of those voices didn't change that mind of that council or other Councilors who voted against it for multiple terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9291.148s">I</a>  also want to say that <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9294.793s">You've</a>  heard of multiple differing opinions from the six people who supposedly all believe the same thing tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9301.399s">We</a>  don't obviously believe the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9303.54s">We've</a>  all said, we believe in different pieces of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9307.123s">So</a>  that's what I'm talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9308.665s">I'm</a>  not talking about, I'm sorry for bringing politics into politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9311.527s">Of</a>  course this is politics. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9312.888s">I'm</a>  talking about misrepresenting the information and the facts on the matter and the things that people say to score political points, to try to make something seem like what it isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9324.788s">because</a>  that may serve some sort of purpose, or it may advantage your position, or maybe you'll end up getting the result that you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9331.212s">It's</a>  not something that I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9335.155s">We</a>  can go back and look at the tape. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9336.676s">I'm</a>  very, very, very consistent in saying that I do, I say what I think should happen, and I try to represent those values and those principles based on the facts and the information that I have at hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9356.516s">I</a>  did want to ask the Collins Center a question about what <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9362.952s">it</a>  looks like in terms of the competitiveness of elections in districts where you have, in cities or other communities in Massachusetts where you have systems like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9373.596s">Do</a>  you see that having, or do you have any data to talk about what it looks like, how many races go uncontested in ward seats versus an all-at-large model? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9388.351s">how</a>  long incumbent terms are in models like this versus models where there's more competitive elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9394.513s">Do</a>  you have that data available to you? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9396.213s">And</a>  also, if members of the Charter Study Committee would like to talk about discussions that may have happened in the Charter Study Committee around what this model would mean for competitive elections, incumbency, et cetera.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9412.877s">We</a>  don't collect electoral information.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9416.02s">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9416.52s">We</a>  don't collect electoral information. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9418.741s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9419.221s">So</a>  competitiveness of the different models wasn't considered as part of the discussion.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9423.202s">I</a>  know. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9426.603s">And</a>  not that I recall.</p>

    <p>[Wright]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9428.223s">I</a>  can only speak from my personal experience.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9431.044s">I'd</a>  be happy to hear personal experience.</p>

    <p>[Wright]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9433.085s">I</a>  was a seven term Alderman became city council, um, until I decided not to run. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9443.177s">of</a>  the six times I ran for re-election, three times I had appointments.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9447.219s">So</a>  about half the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9449.44s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9450.121s">And</a>  again, I talked to my colleagues in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9452.622s">I</a>  talked to my colleagues in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9454.063s">I</a>  talked to my colleagues in Everett. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9456.184s">And</a>  were you in a ward-based seat?</p>

    <p>[Wright]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9458.085s">I</a>  was in a ward.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9459.486s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9460.066s">A</a>  lot of ward-based seats go uncontested. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9462.988s">Under</a>  the current model of the city council, no one ever goes uncontested. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9469.111s">Those</a>  are the facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9470.912s">And</a>  I'm not saying let's stay at all at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9473.173s">The</a>  people don't want that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9475.055s">But</a>  I'm hearing that we don't have data on competitiveness. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9477.778s">We</a>  didn't discuss competitiveness. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9479.7s">And</a>  I think having competitive elections where the people in office are challenged to maintain their seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9486.392s">is</a>  essential and that we should have a form and a structure of democracy that encourages that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9491.396s">And</a>  I think that if we're going to move in a direction where there's going to be potentially more uncompetitive elections, that we need a balance there. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9498.643s">And</a>  I think saying that we're going to have a model where eight of the seats may often be uncontested or at least uncontested half the time, and only three of the seats would be contested more regularly is not a good balance for the competitiveness of elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9512.174s">And</a>  those are the questions that I would like to see <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9514.955s">looked</a>  at more or for us to have a discussion here about looking at a model that has a little more balance considering that we didn't consider those questions and we don't have the answers in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9526.457s">I</a>  wanna be challenged, run against me. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9531.058s">I</a>  don't think this is a model that encourages that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9534.679s">That's</a>  why I put this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9536.359s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9539.52s">Vice</a>  President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9543.792s">Thank</a>  you, Chair Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9546.233s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9546.833s">I</a>  appreciate those comments from President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9548.634s">I</a>  think that gets right to the heart of the issue as I see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9552.436s">One</a>  last point on this through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9558.215s">If</a>  my fellow councilors' opinions earlier were in good faith about outcomes and not about politicking and taking shots to make perceived opponents look bad, I think that then he would be sticking to the substance at hand and not derailing this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9572.419s">With</a>  lies about us voting in lockstep and other false narratives, I also encourage people to run the tape or look at our duly promulgated council records. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9581.202s">And</a>  people will find that the Councilors on this body who share an endorsement just disagree with each other all the time, which I believe is how it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9590.107s">I</a>  appreciate the discussion so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9593.649s">I</a>  have made a motion that the five district Councilors and five at large Councilors be considered as part of President Bear's amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9604.655s">I</a>  would request that we move on to public comment and then take votes on motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9610.338s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9612.264s">Vice</a>  President Collins, just to clarify, do you mean four districts and five at large?</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9617.588s">Yes,</a>  that is what I meant to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9618.709s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9619.95s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9620.951s">I</a>  also want to move to public comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9623.414s">I</a>  do have a number of questions for the Collins Center, especially the members of the Charter Study Committee, who I think it's important to hear from. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9633.222s">Yes?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9636.085s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9640.234s">In,</a>  I know a big goal behind going to a hybrid system, word representation system is this idea, this, you know, desire to get a more diverse city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9654.999s">In</a>  my research into word representation, into different types of representation, there's a big change, a shift in terms of how diversity is viewed as a result of making these structural changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9670.776s">I</a>  think pretty much everyone agrees that at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9674.795s">An</a>  all-at-large system is not good for diversity because it dilutes the votes of minority groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9684.704s">And</a>  we've seen municipalities across the state be challenged for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9688.967s">But</a>  there's also been a rising concern, and this is based on research in the American Political Science Review in the law of, I think it's politics, economics, and organization, where <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9703.584s">people</a>  are worried that creating smaller districts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9708.751s">districts</a>  that tend to be majority and minority actually cuts against racial equity in that it makes fewer politicians responsible for or accountable to minority voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9724.456s">And</a>  I was wondering if this is something that the Charter Study Committee discussed in its consideration of diversity, especially with regards to race. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9739.815s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9742.721s">Yeah,</a>  Chair McDonald did answer the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9745.666s">She</a>  said no. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9749.048s">It's</a>  just a concern to me because it is what political scientists now, I think, have found to be the main mover in terms of racial justice is voters' accountability, or politicians' accountability to voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9765.412s">So</a>  that is something I do want to consider strongly in my consideration of the different options that we have here at the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9776.665s">And</a>  one unseen strength of the alternative proposal, which I do have my questions about too, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9786.169s">is</a>  that you keep the racial proportions quite similar comparing, for example, the historically black community in West Medford in Ward 6. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9798.091s">Combining</a>  it with Ward 8 doesn't change the percentage much at all, and it makes an elected more accountable to those voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9806.873s">Similarly,</a>  in Ward 7, there is more of a difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9810.154s">And</a>  I am slightly more concerned about that one, but it does make <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9815.6s">the</a>  Councilor serving Ward 1 also accountable to minority voters as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9823.409s">I</a>  did actually, I had some open-ended questions about the survey as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9827.313s">Could</a>  you, Chair McDonald, since you know the survey process better than I do, help run me through a little bit of what that process was like and what the results were?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9843.576s">You</a>  mean the process of creating the survey?</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9846.4s">Yes,</a>  both. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9847.762s">Both</a>  creating the survey, but mostly the results and what you got from the results.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9854.054s">The</a>  feedback we got was that we wanted the survey to be accessible, so not too complicated. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9862.42s">We</a>  asked about major questions that voters are most concerned about, which is the composition, term limits, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9873.408s">The</a>  results are all in the final report. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9875.589s">So,</a>  I mean, I can get them, but you all have them, right?</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9881.551s">I</a>  think broad strokes, I'm familiar with the policy recommendations of the survey results. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9888.073s">Could</a>  you remind me about the composition, what questions were asked, if you have that off the top of your mind?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9895.175s">Whether,</a>  for council, you're talking about? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9898.115s">Yes,</a>  for city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9901.516s">Whether</a>  to remain all at large? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9906.81s">to</a>  be ward-based, hybrid-based. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9910.654s">I</a>  mean, we can't be all ward-based, because we only have eight exclusively ward-based, because we only have eight wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9917.161s">So</a>  that's not really an option on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9919.604s">Anyway.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9921.786s">Thanks</a>  for clarifying that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9923.728s">So</a>  we didn't ask about the district system or?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9928.153s">The</a>  combining of the wards? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9929.809s">Oh</a>  yeah, combining of words or... No, that was something that came up in the discussions about the school committee to address the challenges of making school committee, applying word representation to the school committee, because that would have increased the body size. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9947.567s">I</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9948.468s">And</a>  so that's how that came up.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9953.602s">One</a>  point I do find compelling is this idea that we should mix, standardize both sets, the city council and the school committee to use a similar election system. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9964.509s">I'm</a>  worried that, I mean, I think something big I hear when I knock on the doors of people who don't necessarily turn out in local elections is just general confusion with how local elections work, who's voting for who, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9980.578s">Who,</a>  you know, who's up. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9982.721s">Um,</a>  could you explain to me the reasoning behind making city council and school committee, like the compositions different.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9991.111s">Well,</a>  it's. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9992.854s">very</a>  common cities all over the state have a different composition for city council and school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=9999.518s">So</a>  I think voters can figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10003.74s">I</a>  mean, they do in most other cities or many other cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10009.624s">You</a>  know, I think this is laid out in the final report, but I don't think we saw a call to increase the size of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10019.075s">But</a>  we also recognize that the community still wanted board representation for the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10027.858s">I</a>  actually was not on the school committee subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10031.68s">And</a>  I think when you have that discussion, maybe Paulette Van der Kloot would participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10036.762s">She</a>  chaired that subcommittee and they had extensive discussions. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10039.883s">So</a>  I would actually prefer to let her speak more about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10042.544s">I</a>  can tell you in general, because obviously they came back to the full committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10046.979s">And</a>  we then discussed it, so I can tell you more in general, but if you want more specifics of how they reached that, she did give you a more detailed answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10057.829s">But</a>  that was the gist of it, was trying to incorporate ward representation without necessarily increasing it to a body of 11, which we felt was appropriate for council, but not for school committee.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10075.245s">I</a>  know Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10076.345s">Van</a>  der Kloot is on the Zoom, but I know we also, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10080.347s">Van</a>  der Kloot, I see your hand raised, Mr. Clerk, if you can.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10096.433s">Councilor</a>  Tseng, did you want me to go ahead to address that?</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10099.893s">Yeah,</a>  very briefly. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10100.854s">I</a>  know we're covering this on a different day, but I was just wondering about the mismatch.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10107.899s">Well,</a>  I think we certainly considered all the different options. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10112.783s">We</a>  were concerned that not everybody, you know, if we looked over historically at where school committee members, what <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10123.992s">uh</a>  wards they had lived in and we we were concerned in and and the way that our particular uh city there um we don't have a school in each ward so we were looking at school placements and how that worked and it it doesn't really correspond in any way and we were concerned i mean um <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10146.377s">Sometimes</a>  there aren't that many people interested in running for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10151.265s">It's</a>  a very taxing job. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10154.049s">It</a>  takes a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10156.502s">In</a>  the past, the stipends were always considerably lower. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10160.364s">We</a>  don't want someone running for position just because they want to collect the stipend. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10166.246s">And</a>  so after we discussed all of the different options, and then we started trying to say, well, if we were doing ward representation, what would happen if we had wards where no one wanted to be on the school committee? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10180.931s">And</a>  we were concerned about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10184.535s">You</a>  know, after many different looking at this, this to us seemed to be an opportunity to certainly increase representation from different districts in the city, but also minimize other potential problems.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10206.953s">Thank</a>  you, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10208.814s">Barracud.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10209.395s">And</a>  thank you for your service to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10210.816s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10212.348s">It's</a>  always a joy seeing you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10215.471s">I</a>  think that's a helpful explanation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10218.293s">And</a>  I know you all looked at data about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10221.597s">I</a>  don't know if the call-in center is more to contribute about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10224.479s">Is</a>  there usually a big gulf between the number of candidates who run for city council and school committee?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10232.927s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10235.667s">they</a>  don't collect that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10239.089s">I</a>  do just want to say that the discussion about competitiveness, we didn't look at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10246.434s">That's</a>  not, but what we did look at was representation of the wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10251.778s">And</a>  we looked back to 2005 and found that two wards in the city had no Councilor from those wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10262.528s">So</a>  they had zero representation and that two wards that those were words one and four and two words two and three had disproportionate representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10270.996s">And</a>  in terms of the competitiveness, you know, like I said, we didn't look at that we didn't research it, but. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10279.364s">I</a>  can say anecdotally that in my approximately 30 years living in Medford, I've never seen an incumbent city councilor lose an election, and I wouldn't call that competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10290.329s">So</a>  I just wanted to say that.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10293.11s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10294.671s">That's</a>  helpful, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10296.871s">Quickly,</a>  going back to the survey, I am curious about, because I used to work in survey research and public opinion polling, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10306.217s">I'm</a>  curious if you know the demographics or have that information, percentage like renter, homeowner, racial breakdown, income, anything like that.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10318.583s">Yes,</a>  we did some of those, and they should be in the final report. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10322.726s">Some</a>  of the graphics didn't transition well, and so there's actually a new version on the website, I think, with better graphics that you can check. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10330.631s">But</a>  Jean Zotter worked on that a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10333.894s">So</a>  if you wanted more details on that, you could speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10337.716s">I</a>  don't know if she's on Zoom, but she collected a lot of that information and presented it.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10348.853s">I</a>  think I saw Jean earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10350.294s">Oh,</a>  yep. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10351.015s">I</a>  see Jean's hands raised. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10352.656s">Good.</a> </p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10360.443s">Hello,</a>  everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10362.825s">I'm</a>  trying... Good to see everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10368.69s">I'm</a>  trying to look in the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10370.211s">I</a>  think, Justin, your question was about the demographics of the survey respondents.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10375.432s">Yep,</a>  that's correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10377.092s">I</a>  just wanted to know what the breakdown was in terms of things like homeowner, renter, income, et cetera.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10386.274s">So</a>  not everybody gave us demographic information, but those that did tended to be older. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10396.296s">So</a>  45 years or older, that was approximately 54%, which is higher than the city overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10406.115s">81%</a>  were homeowners, which is higher than the city overall, which is around 53%. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10411.664s">52%</a>  were female, which is similar to our city demographics. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10416.572s">79%</a>  were white. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10420.859s">which</a>  is higher than the city overall, which is around 70% white now. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10425.864s">And</a>  74% were non-Hispanic, which is higher than the city overall. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10431.55s">So</a>  it was skewed a little bit towards probably people who have more income, are a little older, whiter and non-Hispanic.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10445.612s">Jean,</a>  if you don't mind, if I could just add that one of the reasons, as she mentioned, not everybody gave demographic information, but one of the reasons we chose to collect it was so that we could try to do outreach to populations that we didn't get as many responses from. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10461.538s">And</a>  Jean was an amazing organizer of listening sessions around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10467.7s">And</a>  we tried to go and we, I mean, it's all in the final report. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10471.902s">So</a>  you can sort of see, but I just wanted to add that.</p>

    <p>[Jean Zotter]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10475.023s">Oh,</a>  thanks, Melba. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10476.203s">We</a>  did. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10476.664s">We</a>  held 15 listening sessions across the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10480.725s">We</a>  had discussions, so it wasn't meant to be reaching a ton of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10487.947s">It</a>  was more to have discussions with smaller groups of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10490.328s">So</a>  91 residents met with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10494.629s">We</a>  had 11 in person and several virtual. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10499.231s">A</a>  couple of them, we offered interpretations in Spanish and Haitian Creole. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10505.138s">One,</a>  we had an ASL interpreter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10507.36s">We</a>  tried to reach groups that we weren't seeing in the survey, and that was very helpful and informed our recommendations.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10519.168s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10519.768s">I</a>  think that's helpful information. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10521.069s">I</a>  appreciate the outreach that the committee has done to reach groups that weren't represented in the survey. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10527.193s">I</a>  just also, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10531.119s">As</a>  someone who's into polling, I want us to be careful with how we're assessing the data as well, especially given that the homeowner to renter ratio is so far off from what the city ratio is, which is 53% to 47% instead of what seemed like 80% to 20%. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10546.205s">But</a>  that's just to help me understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10547.946s">Could</a>  you outline for me a bit <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10559.052s">I</a>  know we talked about in our interview a very long time ago, the idea of exploring different types of electoral systems, so multi-member districts, proportional representation, rank choice, and all of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10571.502s">Could</a>  you help us understand as a council where those conversations went and why those weren't chosen?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10583.456s">We</a>  wanted the charter to succeed with the voters and at the state house. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10590.397s">So</a>  we didn't necessarily look at alternatives that aren't used. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10596.339s">Ranked</a>  choice voting did come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10601.3s">That</a>  is something that we believed would see a hurdle at the state house, especially because Medford during the state question <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10613.69s">voted</a>  for ranked choice voting only with a small majority. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10617.014s">So</a>  I think, you know, the success of the charter, the ultimate success of the charter was a consideration for us.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10625.343s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10626.883s">Um,</a>  I know Councilor Call, or Councilor Callahan brought up the spreadsheet with comparing us to different municipalities around the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10637.812s">Um,</a>  I think a question that comes into my mind is just, what is, why are we choosing one over the other, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10646.259s">If</a>  we have a bigger data set, it seems to make sense to, to hew to that, but <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10652.323s">Was</a>  there much consideration of different municipalities of similar size in different states? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10660.789s">And</a>  is there a reason why Massachusetts was the standard?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10666.193s">Could</a>  you just repeat? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10667.053s">I'm</a>  not sure I cut that.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10669.715s">Councilor</a>  Callaghan showed earlier the spreadsheet of different states, right, and of some in our state with the calculations of councillors per capita.</p>

    <p>[Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10681.716s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10682.917s">I'm</a>  curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10686.119s">Was</a>  that data considered in the committee's study of?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10690.401s">Yes,</a>  we had a spreadsheet of cities in Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10695.064s">We</a>  didn't look at other states. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10697.306s">We</a>  don't know what the interaction of municipal governments with state government is in those states. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10703.89s">There's</a>  just so many other factors that could come into play. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10706.571s">So</a>  we stuck to Massachusetts.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10711.39s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10712.671s">That's</a>  helpful to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10717.074s">I</a>  think that more or less, I have questions for President Bears, but I suspect in the public comment period, there are gonna be questions about that proposal as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10727.181s">So</a>  I wanted to get to public comment first. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10732.144s">Yes,</a>  President Bears has some questions.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10735.246s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10736.367s">First,</a>  I just wanted to state that some of the concerns that <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10741.058s">former</a>  member Van der Kloot raised are exactly the reasons that I have concerns about the model. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10746.001s">But</a>  I have just two questions for you, Chair McDonald, if I may. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10754.345s">In</a>  your research from past elections, did you find any council election that went uncontested?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10765.07s">I</a>  believe not. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10768.127s">You</a>  know, I don't have it in front of me, so I can't say 100%, but I don't think we did.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10774.109s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10776.891s">To</a>  be honest, I mean, just there is a graph in the final report that represents the number of Councilors who ran from each ward and then who won. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10789.596s">So</a>  there is information about that in the final report.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10793.737s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10795.909s">And,</a>  you know, just given the discussion that we've had tonight and given the discussions that I've been having, would you or leadership of the Charter Study Committee or in partnership with us and the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10809.862s">be</a>  willing to survey specific options for hybrid representation at this point so that we could determine more specifically what the intent of the people who was surveyed with about the different options that have been proposed?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10823.713s">I</a>  don't think that would be my decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10825.935s">So,</a>  I mean, I think that would have to be between you and the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10831.199s">I</a>  don't, I mean, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10836.963s">We've</a>  officially finished our work, so I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10842.585s">I</a>  just don't feel like I can answer that.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10846.327s">If</a>  we were to move in that direction, would you be open to being consulted in the process?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10851.629s">Possibly.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10852.129s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10853.17s">I</a>  just think we actually mostly agree on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10855.29s">We</a>  all agree on a hybrid model of some at large and some local representation, and I think we've spent <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10862.75s">90</a>  minutes plus, two hours, and maybe even longer than that, arguing about the specifics of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10868.194s">And</a>  we don't actually have a lot of data beyond the fact that people want a hybrid form of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10875.618s">And</a>  it might behoove us to try to do a scientific poll to actually ask—give people specific options about what that could look like.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10883.543s">Well,</a>  are you referring to multi—I mean, the— <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10891.068s">Sorry,</a>  it's getting late. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10892.349s">The</a>  options you talked about before.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10894.33s">Not</a>  proportional, not rank choice, none of that.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10897.353s">So</a>  what are you talking about exactly?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10899.814s">Like</a>  the district versus board.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10903.757s">Just</a>  simply district versus.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10905.438s">I</a>  want to consult on what we would specifically ask.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10908.14s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10908.741s">But</a>  it just seems to me that we basically all agree that there should be <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10913.362s">a</a>  hybrid model where there's some level of local representation and some level of at-large representation, but that beyond that specific question, the residents weren't asked about different models that that could look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10925.446s">And</a>  to be frank, and I understand that some people disagree with this, the Charter Study Committee chose two different options for the two different legislative bodies of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10934.169s">And</a>  so</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10937.329s">But</a>  we explained why.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10939.49s">I</a>  understand why you felt, why this committee's recommendations felt that they could be considered differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10945.091s">I</a>  just think that the reason that I put forward what I proposed is because I saw what you guys wrote for that school committee.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10952.053s">I</a>  mean, we wouldn't be the only city that has this configuration with a different configuration for school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10958.695s">Lowell,</a>  for instance, has an exact, you know, they have eight wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10963.296s">They</a>  have 11 ward Councilors, one from each ward, three at large, and then their school committee is broke down with districts at large. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10972.482s">And</a>  they have a seven-member school committee as well.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10974.743s">I</a>  mean, there's a bunch of different configurations across a bunch of different cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10978.446s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10978.846s">I'm</a>  just saying it's not unheard of.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10980.567s">I'm</a>  not suggesting it's unheard of. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10982.548s">I'm</a>  just suggesting that—I'll leave it at that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10987.191s">I</a>  think we could get more information about the specifics and ask the voters, because I <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=10994.963s">I</a>  just think there are some pitfalls that have been for the school committee correctly identified in the formation of the composition of the school committee that I'm very concerned would be very similar for the council if composed differently. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11008.567s">And</a>  I think it's worth trying to have a deeper answer to that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11012.808s">So</a>  I might propose that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11016.645s">path</a>  forward, but.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11018.226s">I</a>  mean, there are timelines also. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11021.328s">So</a>  that's something to consider as well.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11024.87s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11025.79s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11026.651s">It's</a>  my understanding that Daniel Bullocka, who was on the, Danielle, who was on the CSC has a comment about that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11037.136s">Mr.</a>  Bares. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11038.937s">President</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11046.747s">Danielle,</a>  give us one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11051.555s">Oh,</a>  there we go.</p>

    <p>[Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11054.658s">Yeah,</a>  I don't want to speak for the whole committee, but the way that I think about the difference is that I liked Paulette's proposal because it fits nicely in with the way that I think about school districts for the elementary level. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11070.071s">And</a>  those folks representing those different districts, I'm not sure if that's exactly how it works out in the wards, but that made a lot of sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11081.841s">I</a>  do appreciate like everyone like everyone's thoughtfulness about how both of these models would have their benefits and and maybe their risks. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11090.446s">I</a>  see like having the two different models being a way to try this out and I think councilor Azar said this earlier is like we're also hopefully committing to a regular review of the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11099.531s">I</a>  think that an incumbent in a two ward district versus a one ward district I don't see the competition being very different. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11109.476s">I</a>  also think that <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11111.957s">No,</a>  you know, I think, you know, we don't know how this will work out and I think, increasing the size and increasing the, the number of, or like, you know, going toward representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11121.662s">In</a>  my mind, would, would help in, in, not just racial diversity representation but economic as we talked about but. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11133.07s">I</a>  also think that there's a lot of competition in Medford when it comes to ideas like we see that in this meeting today we see them in all these meetings where like I, I just have a hard time thinking that with the way that we see like people running for or people running against those people that like there aren't going to be people running against. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11151.393s">people</a>  in current seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11153.735s">I</a>  also think that there's a different way of approaching that, which is to address their term limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11157.759s">So,</a>  we wouldn't have to worry about somebody being in a city council seat until they decide to retire if we decided on different term limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11166.268s">But</a>  again, I think that it sounds like everybody here is considering moving towards this more representative system. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11173.235s">I</a>  think that <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11175.506s">This</a>  was one of the more important elements of the charter review to me was moving to a more, to me, the most representative that we could be. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11183.577s">And</a>  I still do think that what we proposed is that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11187.963s">But</a>  yeah, thanks for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11189.284s">And</a>  that's all I have to say.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11191.427s">Thank</a>  you, Danielle. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11194.687s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11195.888s">I</a>  realized that I have two quick questions for the committee members who are here. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11203.012s">Was</a>  there much conversation about the prospect of gerrymandering?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11207.294s">I'm</a>  sorry, of what?</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11208.355s">Of</a>  gerrymandering wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11211.597s">I</a>  know in 2020 it was different because of the pandemic, but normally <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11217.965s">wards</a>  are drawn at the local level, the maps move up to the national level, is my understanding of things. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11224.268s">And</a>  I know in 2020, this council did entertain three different maps to draw the wards.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11238.116s">It's</a>  the census data.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11239.917s">Yes,</a>  it's based on census data, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11242.546s">I</a>  know a big concern at every level with these districts is the idea that we might gerrymander. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11251.272s">I</a>  think to me, an unspoken, something that we haven't brought up with alternative proposal on the table here is that we do have districts that are harder to gerrymander. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11264.281s">And</a>  I am slightly worried that with smaller districts, with a greater number of districts, we'd be able to <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11272.343s">or</a>  politicians are more likely to gerrymander those districts?</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11275.665s">I</a>  feel like that's a question for the Pollen Center, because they have more knowledge about that in general.</p>

    <p>[Wright]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11284.432s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11286.154s">Well,</a>  gerrymandering is something you would look at on a case-by-case basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11294.2s">Somebody</a>  would have to challenge gerrymandering. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11296.923s">First,</a>  initially, just think about the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11300.941s">The</a>  federal census comes out every 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11304.423s">The</a>  city gets the data. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11308.286s">What</a>  I've seen is the city clerk ends up drawing up a map of the new wards because the ward lines will change based on where population has shifted within the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11323.337s">And</a>  then that map will come to you or a variety of maps showing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11328.998s">So</a>  at that point, this body, however it constituted, would look at it and make a decision as to which map best represents the residents of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11343.284s">And</a>  in doing so, ideally, you would approve a map that is not gerrymandered. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11351.808s">And</a>  if it is, then it would be subject to challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11355.889s">So.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11361.073s">it</a>  would go to the Secretary of State as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11363.174s">They</a>  would look at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11366.514s">The</a>  only thing else, if I can add one thing, based on everything I've heard tonight, and Mr. McDonald touched on it, is you're on a timeline to try to get this on the ballot for November, and you will need to get this <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11389.002s">through</a>  the legislature, which means you're gonna have to work with your state delegation, and they're gonna have to shepherd it through. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11396.687s">And</a>  if you're going to create anything that the legislature hasn't seen before, or is not consistent with what they usually see, I would suggest you take that under consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11418.307s">I'm</a>  not making any predictions as to what the legislature would do with any, excuse me, with anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11423.572s">My</a>  voice is changing apparently. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11426.795s">But,</a>  you know, I'm sure you all have the practical wisdom of realizing what can happen when somebody gets to the legislature that they're not used to seeing. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11438.206s">So,</a>  you know, that's kind of just a word to the wise.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11442.904s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11443.984s">I</a>  mean, I, yeah, I was just gonna say state representatives have offered to me to remain in contact about ideas that we might have as a city council too. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11454.667s">President</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11456.208s">Just</a>  to follow up on that, would you consider if we were to adopt the three at large for district or five at large for district for the council for that to be unusual for the legislature to see?</p>

    <p>[Wright]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11474.517s">I</a>  don't have statistics on what they've seen across the state as far as that goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11480.739s">I</a>  think to the extent there was some discussion about having, as I understood what was being discussed, more than one representative, like a district with two.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11489.341s">Oh</a>  yeah, multi-member district or proportional representation.</p>

    <p>[Wright]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11492.602s">That,</a>  it's my understanding, only exists in two communities right now in Massachusetts, one of which is looking to change its form of government.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11501.024s">Yeah,</a>  I don't think we're considering that at this point.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11503.702s">Yeah,</a>  I don't think we're considering those options.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11517.657s">One</a>  more question for the members of the Charter Study Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11522.4s">A</a>  big discourse that in Medford for a while about moving towards a ward representation system is the studied, there are a lot of studies about how ward Councilors can oftentimes <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11537.782s">putting</a>  it more ugly, become thieves of little fiefdoms, and determine how the success or failure of development projects in their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11550.358s">There's,</a>  I believe, a 20% <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11553.655s">correlation</a>  with regards to 20% fewer projects being approved, permits being approved in ward-based systems. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11566.48s">I</a>  was wondering what kind of conversations the committee had about that.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11570.842s">We</a>  did look at that and we asked, we looked for the research and we asked the Collins Center and we only found <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11577.98s">one</a>  study. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11580.121s">If</a>  there are more, we didn't find them and we couldn't, the Collins Center didn't know of any either. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11585.905s">And</a>  we also mentioned that in the final report that that was the finding that you quoted, but there were also caveats, which included that it was a, it was mostly looked at towns and that more study would be warranted for the kind of <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11608.206s">area,</a>  areas like Medford cities, and also that he didn't, the author didn't consider potential benefits of ward representation, including increased diversity. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11620.874s">So</a>  it just didn't, it was one study, looked at one thing, and it wasn't a really broad, there wasn't much broad agreement on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11632.443s">and</a>  the issues of representation and the potentiality for increased diversity, more accessibility to running for office were just more compelling to us.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11645.194s">Thanks</a>  for that summary. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11648.556s">If</a>  no one has, if no other Councilors have any questions for the call center or for the members of the CSC, I'd like to move to public comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11657.804s">I</a>  know there are folks here who've been here for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11660.733s">So</a>  if you're in person, please line up behind the microphone. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11663.775s">I</a>  see some hands on Zoom as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11665.936s">Mr.</a>  Gervino, you've been standing for a while.</p>

    <p>[Giovino]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11671.58s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11671.96s">It's</a>  good to have the opportunity to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11676.387s">Can</a>  I ask for your name and address? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11679.008s">Ron</a>  Giovino, 326 East Porter Road, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11682.77s">I</a>  appreciate the opportunity to be part of this forum, to be able to talk to the public on this very important issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11690.633s">And</a>  I think this is one of the most important pieces of our work. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11694.795s">I</a>  was a member of the Charter Study Review from the beginning, participating in both the Ward Representation Subcommittee and the School Committee Subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11705.863s">along</a>  with many listening sessions, ice cream at Wright's Pond, interviews, and of course, all our meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11714.667s">I</a>  do wanna say publicly that without the leadership of our chairperson, Milbaugh McDonald, who kept us in line, kept us with the one theme of creating a faceless, apolitical document, a living document that would be able to be changed in the best interest of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11736.232s">We</a>  didn't take this ward representation piece lightly. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11741.613s">And</a>  I think, you know, I can break it down into very simple terms. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11746.714s">We</a>  want our neighbors to feel like they have a neighbor at this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11752.675s">And</a>  that's what it comes down to. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11755.556s">Every</a>  one of you who represent the city also live in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11761.882s">and</a>  you go downstairs and you go get your car, and you see four neighbors who have access to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11768.466s">There</a>  are parts of this community that don't have access, and that's what we wanted to give them, access to talk to somebody in their neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11779.753s">And</a>  for me, and I can only speak for me, that was the theme, to give each one of those neighborhoods <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11787.352s">slash</a>  wards that ability to not only have someone to go to like you know their Salem street discussion St Clair discussion tops discussion, who do I call I don't know you, who do I call. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11803.029s">And</a>  they'd know, Ward 3 rep, Jim Jones, that's who I need to call. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11808.07s">And</a>  Jim Jones also knew that those folks that were talking to him, that were keeping him in office for the next term. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11814.591s">So</a>  there was a natural togetherness that represented them in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11820.332s">And</a>  everybody deserves that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11822.113s">And</a>  as we know, that doesn't happen, it hasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11824.873s">2005,</a>  there's some wards that have zero representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11828.957s">And</a>  we thought that was not right. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11830.838s">The</a>  other thing that an assumption that all we're doing is putting one of 11 people on a city council for the entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11840.381s">We're</a>  not giving ward reps powers. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11843.262s">There's</a>  no superpower. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11845.243s">All</a>  you are is one of 11 votes, nothing more, nothing less. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11851.68s">And</a>  to assume that you all live in your neighborhood, do you make Cherry Street your priority when you're up here making laws? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11860.188s">No,</a>  of course not. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11861.869s">And</a>  that's what we expect from our ward representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11865.152s">And</a>  that's why we think it's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11868.195s">The</a>  district discussion that happened with the school committee, and when I'm here talking about the school committee, there's a thousand other reasons why we went district. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11878.764s">not</a>  the least which is some folks have children in schools in different wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11885.928s">So</a>  there's a lot to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11887.709s">And</a>  we'll talk about that when that comes up. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11890.431s">I</a>  think what we have to look at is exactly everybody who's voting should have someone they know here. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11902.97s">who</a>  is at least not voting for them, not doing things specific to them, but talking to them both ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11910.376s">I</a>  can talk to my ward two rep, the ward two rep can come to me and share information. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11916.481s">It</a>  just makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11918.083s">Going</a>  to 11, just one out of 11, it just made too much sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11925.609s">The</a>  discussion about open wards, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11929.447s">Well,</a>  we believe that this is such a positive change in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11934.552s">It</a>  is going to foster a new generation of new people who don't have to worry about raising $20,000 to come here, who don't have to go to parts of the city they're just unfamiliar with. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11948.764s">They</a>  can sit at church. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11950.146s">They</a>  could sit in a community center. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11951.667s">They</a>  could sit at a basketball game and say, hey, Jim, why don't you run? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11955.317s">And</a>  that guy gets to run and he gets to come up here and do great things for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11959.64s">Those</a>  folks are not around. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11961.722s">Where</a>  are they? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11963.443s">This</a>  gives them that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11965.324s">So</a>  my message that I wanna share, and again, I'm not speaking for the committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11971.428s">I'm</a>  speaking for somebody who was here for two years, listening to my fellow committee people and understanding what the goal was. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11978.133s">And</a>  the goal is to foster representation to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11982.136s">So</a>  everybody knows. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11984.17s">that</a>  if there's something going on in my community, I know somebody on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11989.192s">And</a>  I think that we have to not talk about the negatives of money and other things. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=11996.195s">Let's</a>  just assume that this is a new opportunity for new, fresh ideas and new people to come in and win for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12003.939s">And</a>  instead of looking at Wyoming or Alaska <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12007.588s">Do</a>  what I did, call Gary Christensen over in Malden. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12010.87s">Let</a>  him tell you what the ward system over in Malden does. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12013.312s">You</a>  don't have to go far. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12015.233s">Go</a>  have lunch with Gary, he'll tell you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12016.874s">He</a>  tells you a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12018.855s">He</a>  tells me why he doesn't want to be the president of the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12023.558s">He's</a>  a great mayor who has some great ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12026.32s">And</a>  so instead of, let's just talk about the people here. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12029.582s">And</a>  I think, you know, two purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12033.985s">One</a>  is that districts <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12035.766s">don't</a>  accomplish that goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12037.567s">Districts</a>  still leave a hole for four people, four wards to not have any representation, still leaves that opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12044.751s">When</a>  you're combining eight to four, that means four wards can still go with zero representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12050.935s">And</a>  we don't like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12053.437s">The</a>  eight <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12054.918s">One</a>  to each ward satisfies that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12057.64s">And</a>  trust me, being here for 66 years, I have a pretty good idea that when people in Bedford see need, they step up and do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12066.787s">And</a>  if it's even 20 people, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12069.108s">that</a>  start a drive in a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12071.529s">I</a>  think that's what we're all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12073.089s">And</a>  you guys are all safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12074.269s">This</a>  isn't about you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12075.65s">This</a>  is about the living document 20 years from now that's been reviewed three or four times and changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12082.531s">Let's</a>  give this one a chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12084.052s">I</a>  think the people are excited about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12086.032s">They</a>  were eating ice cream and talking about ward representation two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12090.113s">Now</a>  they formulated opinions, and another survey is just going to tell you that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12094.475s">So,</a>  I'm talking to the folks at home, because ultimately they're the ones who make the decision on where the city goes, and its charter, I appreciate your time, and I appreciate Milva, and all the other members of the committee who really worked very hard, not for their any political purpose, but to make the city better. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12112.744s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12117.714s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12118.635s">I'm</a>  going to Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12120.016s">I</a>  see Paul Geraghty. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12122.737s">Name</a>  and address for the record when you're unmuted, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12126.64s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Paul Garrity]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12126.98s">Hi,</a>  my name is Paul Geraghty, 40 Cedar Road here in Bedford. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12141.569s">I</a>  appreciate the work of the Charter Committee and I do appreciate the <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12146.935s">amount</a>  of thought and diligence being given to this subject matter by the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12152.179s">But</a>  in listening to the discussion tonight, I'm coming away with two thoughts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12157.102s">One,</a>  is the weight of the committee's thinking to have competitive races, is the weight of the committee come away with the best policymaking decision structure possible? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12174.535s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12175.839s">As</a>  Ron Givino said previously, I really do believe that innovation and good decisions come from the most unexpected places. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12185.804s">I</a>  feel that the more voices that are in the conversation, the better the final outcome can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12192.267s">So</a>  again, I'm hearing, you know, do we want to have competitive races or do we want to have good real-time policymaking process? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12203.885s">In</a>  my opinion, I think going to the ward representation is the way to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12208.447s">And</a>  we do have the safeguard that in time we can go back via the charter to say, well, we made a mistake. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12216.171s">Let's</a>  go back, rethink it and change it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=12218.372s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
