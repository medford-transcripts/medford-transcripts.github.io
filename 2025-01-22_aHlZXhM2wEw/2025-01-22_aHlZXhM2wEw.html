    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=231.782s">Governance</a>  Committee, January 22nd, 2025. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=235.525s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, can you please call the roll?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=238.488s">President</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=239.409s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=240.229s">Vice</a>  President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=246.975s">I</a>  see Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=248.236s">I'm</a>  gonna mark her as present because I can see her. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=253.921s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=257.404s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=258.044s">Present.</a> </p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=259.223s">chair</a>  say present five present non absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=262.905s">The</a>  meeting is called to order. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=265.046s">Today</a>  we'll be discussing resolution <a href="../resolutions/24-468.pdf"><font color="green">24-468</font></a> resolution to discuss updates to the city charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=272.91s">This</a>  is one of three scheduled substantive charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=277.812s">charter</a>  review meetings where we will review the recommendations sent to us by the mayor's office of the work that the Charter Study Committee has done. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=286.8s">I</a>  know the chair of the Charter Study Committee is in the audience with us today. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=290.503s">I</a>  did send out an official invite to this meeting through the CSC email address. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=299.471s">I</a>  was thinking, because we have so much to work through, and just to remind folks at home, what we have to talk about today is the preamble, article one, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=310.749s">discussing</a>  incorporation, short title definitions, article two about the legislative branch, and article nine, general provisions, section 9-6, which concerns itself with ordinances and the legislative branch as well, which is why it's in this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=328.014s">Because</a>  there's so much to review and talk about today, I was thinking that we could cover the sections in order in the city charter draft that was sent to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=341.198s">and</a>  take composition and compensation at the end, because those, I expect, will be very substantive discussions with a lot of input and discussion required. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=352.962s">And</a>  I don't want the small but very important things to get lost in the substance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=360.724s">With</a>  that being said, do councillors have any opening thoughts or thoughts on the preamble or article one of the draft city charter? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=373.835s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=375.637s">Let</a>  me make sure I can see. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=392.151s">I</a>  should also note that we have representatives from the Collins Center today in the audience with us, too, to work through substance questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=416.465s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=417.125s">President</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=419.767s">Sorry,</a>  I missed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=422.368s">Thank</a>  you chair saying, um, I want to, uh, thank my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=427.951s">Thank</a>  you for putting together these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=429.512s">Thank</a>  the members of the charter study committee, the mayor and the Collins center for their work up to this point. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=435.955s">Um,</a>  and especially for those who are here tonight, as well as member of the public members of the public who are interested in this topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=443.298s">Um,</a>  we are, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=445.987s">And</a>  I think I've said this a few times now, we're working on all three of the big three that Councilor Knight once told me the city council is responsible for this term. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=457.351s">We've</a>  passed a budget ordinance and a budget, and we have another budget coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=462.932s">Obviously</a>  we are in, I think meeting 18 or 19 of the term of the planning and permitting committee regarding zoning updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=471.075s">And</a>  we are here tonight on the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=475.064s">which</a>  is the foundational document for our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=478.786s">And</a>  we are looking at the first update in nearly 40 years and bringing us into, I would say, the modern age of city charters based on what we're looking at here and before us with the proposal from the Charter Study Committee revised by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=497.858s">And</a>  by and large, I think this proposal is a really great proposal, a charter that the people can understand and something that I wholeheartedly support as a whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=511.758s">Last</a>  week I submitted to the council and shared with the public very openly a series of amendments that I would like to propose for discussion tonight by this committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=522.786s">And</a>  I am hopeful for the consideration and moving forward on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=528.251s">But</a>  I also just want to note that part of the reason that I went about this the way that I did is that there have been fantastic discussions <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=539.041s">from</a>  multiple people all over the Internet talking about what they would like to see, what they wouldn't like to see, bringing forward new ideas that have added to my knowledge base and that I am going to bring to the discussions that we have tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=557.372s">As</a>  regards to the first article and the sections within it, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=563.587s">I</a>  want to thank the study committee for putting together a thoughtful preamble. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=568.81s">I</a>  really think it represents what our community is, as well as its rich history, as it says right in here, our city's rich history and where we want to go and what the purpose of a charter is. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=582.097s">As</a>  regards to the rest of the article one and sections, I did have a couple of minor proposals around the definitions, but they do relate to <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=594.542s">the</a>  proposal around the composition of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=596.825s">So</a>  I will not make any motions or discuss them at this time, but we'll discuss them when that topic comes up for the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=605.093s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=608.536s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro is next in the queue.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=611.787s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=612.888s">I</a>  just want to acknowledge that from the perspective of one of my previous modes of employment was writing and having a really solid draft that is so foundational and so well-written and well-studied and has so much work that's put into it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=637.009s">I'm</a>  so grateful to have this to start <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=640.562s">with</a>  and so grateful to the committee and all of the work that they've put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=645.963s">I</a>  agree that the preamble is really lovely. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=648.624s">The</a>  first article, I don't have anything that I would want to edit, but I just really appreciate everything that we have to start with. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=657.146s">I</a>  have a lot of things that I'd like to say later on tonight, but there's, I just, it's so much easier to start <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=668.487s">doing</a>  further work when you have something that's really good to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=676.632s">And</a>  I just want to say thank you to the Charter Study Committee for that grueling work, all of that research, all of those conversations with the public, and all of the work that they did at the Collins Center, and express my gratitude for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=691.561s">So</a>  thank you all very much.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=697.204s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=699.595s">Councilor</a>  Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=700.596s">I</a>  first want to acknowledge the fact that as one councilor, I was, when I first started my journey as a city councilor, I was firmly behind the charter change charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=712.965s">And</a>  as we started moving forward and we started seeing some of the changes and what it can impact, my biggest <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=719.925s">The</a>  piece that really turned me around to vote against the charter review at the time was really looking at ward representation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=727.792s">And</a>  I think it's because of working in a community that has ward representation and really having some situations where you saw <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=739.04s">the</a>  input of ward representation being looked at in some cases as special interests from section of the city to section of the city, but not what's best for the whole community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=750.043s">So</a>  I found myself being very stubborn and stuck on my beliefs. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=755.644s">And</a>  what I think I needed to do was take a step back. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=759.065s">And</a>  I know that reading all the information that Mr. McDonald's team has done with the charter review and talking to <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=767.884s">Mr.</a>  Jovino and different members of the committee and then reaching out to different colleagues from neighboring communities that have ward representation and truly understanding the positive impacts. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=780.908s">And</a>  I think that I was so narrow-minded, my thinking at the time was so narrow-minded that I really need to expand and really look at the greater picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=789.47s">And</a>  as I see this presentation, I realized that <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=795.255s">You</a>  know, if I could turn the clock back and if I could have helped by moving this forward back a few years ago when the commitment for the council was needed, I think I would do that today. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=808.685s">But</a>  what I see in place is so impressive in the fact that we have people that were committed <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=816.321s">that</a>  reached out to probably one of the greatest support teams with the Collins Center and someone who I respect in the world of municipalities, former alderman in Melrose and former city solicitor Frank Wright and listening and answering, listening to how he's answering the questions and his team and I think that this is a great <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=838.65s">great</a>  situation right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=840.552s">I</a>  love what we have, what we've crafted. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=843.134s">I</a>  have some reservations as well, but I know my colleagues have shared some, and I think that the biggest takeaway from this is I'm a huge advocate now for 11 councils. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=856.925s">I'm</a>  a huge advocate for ward representation for all eight wards. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=862.009s">You</a>  realize as I talk to <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=864.503s">as</a>  I talk to people, even in the city of Medford, and we talk about getting people involved in the election process. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=870.727s">And</a>  as I sit with marginalized people and they say, George, you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=873.729s">It's</a>  easy for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=875.13s">You</a>  have a base. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=876.571s">So</a>  when you run at large, it's easy for you to raise $20,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=879.973s">It's</a>  easy for you to say you represent everybody, because I think I've done that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=884.636s">I</a>  wouldn't ever take away that I represented everybody in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=889.079s">And</a>  if I ever ran, if it was the time that I ran, I probably would run at large just for the fact that I enjoy <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=894.428s">the</a>  whole community, that whole battle. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=897.15s">But</a>  talking to my fellow colleagues in neighboring communities, you understand how important it is for mostly marginalized people that have been underrepresented. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=906.955s">And</a>  right now there's a battle going on in another room talking about zoning reform at Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=913.198s">And</a>  as a person who grew up off of Salem Street, my former neighbors have called me and said, George, why wouldn't you want ward representation with every ward considering <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=924.337s">Shame</a>  on you, because we didn't hear from you at Salem Street when it came to the ward. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=928.699s">We</a>  felt like we weren't listened to. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=930.9s">And</a>  this is why now it's a battle with the Salem Street zoning situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=935.282s">And</a>  we're seeing that in pockets all over the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=938.083s">What</a>  we're seeing at Tufts University with the 10-story building, how it's affecting that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=942.625s">And</a>  I've talked to friends and neighbors there at St. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=944.326s">George.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=944.606s">Here</a>  we go again. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=945.747s">The</a>  charter review is important because if we had a representative that we can go into in our own backyard that we see every day at the coffee shop, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=953.785s">then</a>  it wouldn't, the information wouldn't have been getting out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=956.767s">And</a>  one of the biggest things I've had, the negative pieces I've had is a lack of information that's going out to the community because the lack of a written newspaper, the lack of true communication across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=968.293s">And</a>  one piece that I found that made me feel secure in my process as I go forward with this is the thought process saying, you know what, we might not have a newspaper. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=979.277s">but</a>  everybody in every small pocket of our community now will have someone that they feel like they can call. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=985.262s">And</a>  so there are so many things I've learned, and like, again, I'm a big boy now, and I've learned a lot, good and bad, and I wish I could turn back the clock on some of the decisions I made, but when I see the information that's in front of us, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1003.417s">I'm</a>  really excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1004.539s">I'm</a>  really excited and I commend all of you for all the hard work that you've done. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1008.605s">And</a>  again, if you've ever felt that I was an enemy to the cause, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1018.956s">I</a>  don't think I was educated. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1020.116s">I</a>  didn't educate myself to the cost because I was stubborn. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1022.597s">So</a>  what I see in front of me right now, I can't wait to get this through. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1027.478s">I</a>  can't wait to get this to the legislature. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1029.178s">I</a>  can't wait to come back so we can get this on the ballot and see all these great changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1034.639s">And</a>  I think we see a lot of things that aren't working in Medford and the divide in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1040.301s">A</a>  lot of it's because we haven't done this, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1046.482s">you're</a>  seeing how important word representation is across the Commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1050.624s">And</a>  it's time to, like I said to, my wife and I were talking, I said, Jesus, Dina, she says, it's time for me to grow up and put my big boy pants on and say, hey, listen, this is a great proposal and let's do everything we can to move it forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1064.909s">So</a>  again, I commend your charter review team and our friends from the Collins Center, they've done so much work. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1074.771s">are</a>  the actual experts in this field. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1078.834s">And</a>  I think guided this platform to a very robust discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1084.199s">And</a>  again, so I could talk a buzzard off a meat wagon. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1088.162s">So</a>  I just thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1089.143s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1094.877s">I</a>  see President Bears has requested, but I wanted to make sure other city councilors had a chance to give comments first. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1104.668s">Just</a>  to clarify, we're talking about the preamble and article one. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1108.492s">Okay,</a>  I see none. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1112.456s">President</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1114.229s">I</a>  just wanted to also, I was remiss to not thank the Collins Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1117.41s">They</a>  worked up a great comparison document that we received the other, I think yesterday or the day before, comparing what's in the current charter to the proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1126.412s">So</a>  I just wanted to thank the team at the Collins Center for putting that together. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1129.513s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1130.353s">Yes,</a>  thank you so much for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1131.674s">That</a>  was very, very helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1134.795s">With</a>  Article 1, I did actually have one question about, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1140.347s">a</a>  definition. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1141.148s">I</a>  don't know if Chair McDonald or Collin Center, this is something you guys can help answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1146.875s">I</a>  see that there's a definition here for local newspaper when you control F through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1151.261s">There's</a>  some references to local newspapers, some references to local news publications. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1157.308s">Um,</a>  I know substantively a lot of that shows up later on and like in subjects will cover in future meetings, but seeing that they're going to be spread through two different meetings, I was, I'd be remiss not to ask if that is some language that we should align through the charter document local newspaper versus local news publication. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1179.301s">And</a>  in the definition itself for local newspaper it talks about newspapers with daily or weekly circulation and given the state of local news media. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1189.868s">I</a>  didn't know whether <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1193.828s">requiring</a>  that is something that would eventually hold us up if local news sources were to disappear. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1201.632s">I</a>  know there are folks at home, folks in the city working on creating local news sources, but I know those are still just in the works. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1225.952s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1228.897s">And</a>  if you can, could you give us your name and address for the record? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1233.785s">And</a>  could you spell your name just so we can get it correctly? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1238.453s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Wright]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1252.893s">We</a>  can certainly take a look at, and if there is some disparity between the use of those terms within the draft document, we can certainly revisit that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1263.519s">To</a>  the extent your question relates to whether or not there is such a newspaper, generally, so long as a newspaper is available in the community, so that would include the Boston Papers, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1280.845s">that</a>  would satisfy the legal requirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1284.608s">There</a>  are often statutory requirements to publish in a local newspaper, particularly you've probably seen them for zoning or for probate in the state issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1299.857s">And</a>  so those can be either if you have a local Medford Mercury <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1305.085s">or</a>  if, taking you back a few years, the old Medford Mercury, or you could use a Boston newspaper as well, the Globe or the Herald. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1315.61s">So</a>  I don't know if that, I hope that's helpful.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1318.531s">Yeah,</a>  that helps a lot with the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1320.692s">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1323.154s">Before</a>  we move on to article two about the legislative branch, are there any other questions or comments, motions about article one? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1334.721s">Seeing</a>  none, let's move on to Article 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1341.055s">As</a>  the first section is about composition, I'll skip over that really quickly and move on to section 2-2, Council President and Vice President Election Terms and Hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1354.824s">Do</a>  any councilors have any questions, comments, or motions about this section of the city charter? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1372.589s">I</a>  just had a question for the Collins Center, if you guys already can answer this. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1382.533s">Is</a>  it normal to put very specific powers and duties for the city council president in the city charter? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1390.136s">I</a>  know something that the Charter Study Committee has been talking about is how currently in Medford, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1396.499s">So</a>  many of these things are in separate places. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1400.161s">And</a>  something that will help us understand the charter review process better is if this is something that is normally in a city charter.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1409.906s">The</a>  answer is yes.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1411.107s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1411.627s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1418.511s">Oh,</a>  could we get your name and address for the record, too?</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1421.652s">Maryland</a>  Country is the concept.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1424.134s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1432.449s">Do</a>  we foresee any trouble with the phrase, the president shall prepare the agenda, in terms of, I know currently the president works with the clerk's office to prepare the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1444.284s">Is</a>  that something <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1446.17s">I</a>  know textually, that seems like this is the current language is quite limiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1452.071s">Is</a>  this something that has been discussed before in terms of whether that would be a problem, the president working with other people, not Councilors, to prepare the council agenda?</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1468.355s">This</a>  is kind of generic language, and it certainly doesn't forbid involving the clerk.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1476.34s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1484.862s">I</a>  see President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1487.803s">You</a>  can go to Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1489.023s">Oh,</a>  OK. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1490.903s">George,</a>  give me a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1491.804s">Yeah,</a>  no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1492.804s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1493.604s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1494.464s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1494.824s">Thank</a>  you, Council Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1495.605s">I</a>  know that as I went through my notes, I did have a note. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1500.506s">And</a>  correct me if we'll go back to this again. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1502.726s">I</a>  was a little preoccupied. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1506.39s">As</a>  we started looking into composition of terms of office and eligibility, I wanted to ask the Collins Center, I think that one of the constituents, people that have read this and called and asked opinions, with the mayor's four-year term, and the council too, and school committee too, the question they brought up, I said, well, let me ask if it's common, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1534.457s">you</a>  see that two years really sometimes prohibits true government because you see that it's so short that you're finding that you're always politicking instead of doing what's right. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1546.341s">And</a>  the question is, has that been entertained? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1548.662s">Have</a>  you seen other communities do a three-year term where it's a two-year for school committee, three-year term for the council, and then four-year term for the mayor? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1558.525s">It's</a>  just something that was asked of me, and I just wanted to get your opinion on that.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1565.473s">Well,</a>  a three-year term is very difficult.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1571.397s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1571.777s">Oh,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1576.58s">Give</a>  me one sec.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1578.281s">You're</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1579.141s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1580.642s">A</a>  three-year term is very difficult because you can't have a municipal election in the same year as a presidential. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1589.748s">Actually,</a>  a state election.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1590.968s">OK,</a>  state election. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1591.609s">All</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1594.667s">We</a>  have communities that have three-year terms, but their elections are in June, so that they don't conflict with the dates of the state primary or the state election.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1609.07s">That's</a>  great input. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1611.61s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1613.81s">I</a>  see what they mean. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1614.67s">I</a>  understand what the two-year term is difficult, because it seems like you really, once you get going, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1623.857s">as</a>  an elected official, then all of a sudden you have people that you've promised so much to and they've come to you and said, now it feels like you truly are looking at times at the greater picture of an elected official. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1637.167s">That's</a>  what's the greater good of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1638.588s">So</a>  I appreciate the input and that's something I'll share with them if they're not watching tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1642.991s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1647.492s">see</a>  you president bears thank you Councilor Tseng um just a note uh we're going to come back to 2-1 and 2-4 okay um i just yeah and i appreciated the question i just want to make sure we stay on course have the discussion on those um i have as regards to section 2 or article 2 <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1668.401s">I</a>  have thoughts on 2-5, 2-7, 2-9, 2-10, and then I also have a thought on 9-6 and moving into section two. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1679.644s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1682.325s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1684.346s">Are</a>  there any other questions on section 2-2? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1690.908s">Not</a>  seeing any. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1692.488s">Section</a>  2-3, prohibitions, are there any questions from councilors on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1700.578s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1703.979s">I</a>  did have a quick question on section two, five, actually, sorry, two, five, subsection three.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1712.682s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro, I actually had a quick question about two, three. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1716.063s">Two,</a>  three, you did. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1717.304s">Could</a>  I do that one first? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1718.264s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1720.425s">So</a>  in section two, three B, it says that the city council shall contact the officers and employees serving under the mayor solely through the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1730.293s">Um,</a>  I, so I know, I think all of us as Councilors know that we're contacting city officials city staff with understanding that they serve, they serve the mayor and the people of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1744.397s">I'm,</a>  I know, I also know that a lot of us as Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1748.958s">directly</a>  outreach to a lot of city staff to ask for input, to ask for, to give suggestions and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1758.565s">Do</a>  we see this language, the language I just read out, as limiting that outreach or that interaction?</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1767.411s">Well,</a>  it's important to note that relates to section 2.6 when you're conducting an investigation, which is really different than <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1778.561s">you</a>  know, when do you pick up the trash on Maple Street? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1782.084s">I</a>  don't think it forbids inquiries. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1784.726s">It's</a>  when you're having an investigation or an analysis of something of, you know.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1792.512s">I</a>  just wanted to clarify. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1793.853s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1796.095s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1799.918s">I</a>  think the question is though, not in the case of an investigation or inquiry, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1805.293s">I</a>  regularly communicate with the city assessor to set up a meeting with the resident to talk about their assessment. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1815.881s">This</a>  would seem to prohibit me from doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1817.943s">Is</a>  that true?</p>

    <p>[Wright]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1818.463s">In</a>  my opinion, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1825.829s">The</a>  purpose of this is you cannot order <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1829.15s">Okay,</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1829.791s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1841.181s">Thank</a>  you, and I so appreciate the, first of all, the work from the commission and also the Collins Center. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1848.606s">I</a>  am not a member of this committee, so thank you so much for allowing me to ask a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1855.49s">This</a>  is on the same exact point. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1857.191s">I</a>  know that, for example, when we were working to try and reduce the rodent population, that the person sponsoring a piece of legislation <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1868.43s">was</a>  communicating with the staff in order to understand best how we can help the staff through the ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1874.971s">The</a>  staff needed an ordinance to be changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1876.932s">And</a>  so working together with staff to understand how we can best tailor the ordinance to meet the needs of the staff, that to me, like, I'm 100% in favor of <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1891.825s">nor</a>  shall any member of the city council give orders or direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1894.967s">Absolutely,</a>  I 100% agree.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1896.247s">But</a>  you're looking for coordination, communication.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1899.229s">It</a>  just says, you know, the city council shall contact only solely through the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1904.072s">And</a>  it seems like getting information on how to craft ordinances to best meet the needs of staff, that's, I just wanna make sure, again, we're all asking about this.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1914.317s">We</a>  wanna make sure that it's. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1915.838s">Maybe</a>  we'll look at this language</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1918.259s">That</a>  would be amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1919.399s">I</a>  just specifically, I mean, I wasn't the sponsor of rodent control, but I know how much, you know, that was something staff needed and that the sponsor of that ordinance needed to just hear from and worked with staff members to craft it carefully so that it met the needs of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1936.866s">So</a>  those kinds of things I think are important that we are able to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1941.967s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1943.288s">President</a>  Bears?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1944.577s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1945.037s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1945.157s">And</a>  I think, um, obviously subject if you want to take a look at it and come back, but it would seem to me that if the intent is to make clear that the council cannot order a city employee to do anything, um, maybe just eliminating everything between the comma after section two, six and the word neither. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1965.448s">So</a>  eliminating the city council shall contact the officers and employees serving under the mayor solely through the mayor and <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1972.027s">because</a>  then it would just read, except for the purpose of inquiries and investigations pursuant to section two, six, neither the city council nor any member of the city council shall give orders or directions to any officer or employee, either publicly or privately. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1984.796s">I</a>  don't know if that makes sense to folks.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=1991.801s">I</a>  would really like to talk to the author before I comment.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2015.928s">Or</a>  yeah, I can work on emailing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2017.829s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2018.872s">Great,</a>  we have a motion on the floor by President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2022.694s">Anna's</a>  gonna email it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2024.595s">Okay,</a>  do we have a second by Councilor Lazzaro? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2030.338s">Seeing</a>  that there might be a lot of motions at the end of this meeting, I think it would be wise to take this vote now, when you're ready, Mr. Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2040.023s">I'll</a>  give you a second.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2160.23s">I</a>  have a question just about the process of amending the rules. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2164.831s">We</a>  do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2165.571s">We</a>  change the city council rules in city council meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2170.592s">But</a>  if it's in. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2173.353s">If</a>  it's an ordinance, it needs three readings, uh, to change an ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2178.173s">It</a>  can be. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2178.674s">Um.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2187.51s">Just</a>  as a reminder, or maybe just for the public record, if we can just quickly go over how we change the rules, we do that with a resolution in city council?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2196.036s">Through</a>  the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2198.998s">Yeah,</a>  the city council can change the rules of the city council by majority vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2204.161s">But</a>  it doesn't require multiple readings.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2208.004s">I</a>  know oftentimes it goes through, I believe now it's admin and finance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2213.8s">Oh,</a>  we haven't had to do it this term, but oftentimes it does go through committee first. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2225.025s">Any</a>  other comments on section 2-5? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2228.687s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2230.788s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro has seconded President Ferris' motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2235.43s">Let</a>  me check on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2239.052s">Seeing</a>  none. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2240.533s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2242.269s">when</a>  you're ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2249.655s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2249.775s">Oh,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2250.356s">Yes,</a>  I had a question about 2-5 section B subsection 3. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2257.362s">It</a>  says all sessions of the City Council and of every committee or subcommittee of the City Council shall be open to the public unless another provision is allowed by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2265.689s">The</a>  only thing that comes to mind is executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2268.291s">I</a>  know that's allowed by law. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2269.912s">It</a>  doesn't happen very frequently in our meetings, but I just wonder if that's something we would want to say officially in the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2279.296s">If</a>  it's not necessary, we don't need to say it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2281.217s">It</a>  just occurred to me to ask about it.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2284.378s">Is</a>  that something the Collins Center would like to respond to?</p>

    <p>[Wright]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2295.003s">In</a>  my opinion, it would just <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2299.785s">language</a>  captures the idea of this executive session. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2305.408s">But</a>  if you want it to be more clear, we could look at it, but I think it would capture it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2312.612s">And</a>  then certainly that's state law as well.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2317.374s">That's</a>  fine, that's sufficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2318.575s">I'm</a>  comfortable with that, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2320.396s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2321.796s">Are</a>  there any other comments on the substance in 2-5 before we take up President Bears' motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2330.362s">seeing</a>  none from councillors. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2333.004s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, are you ready for the vote?</p>

In the initial draft, I would propose that it be subsection C, but subject to appropriation, the council being able to have additional support positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2424.908s">That</a>  was something we advocated for in the last term, and I appreciate its inclusion in this draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2430.059s">My</a>  main questions and my proposal here is one, the city messenger position that wasn't included. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2441.807s">So</a>  I proposed that it be included. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2444.209s">And</a>  so that would be a new subsection B. And then I also noted that section A didn't include a residency requirement for the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2453.755s">I</a>  put a draft together that put it back in, but I'm interested to hear <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2460.608s">if</a>  that was not included purposefully or if there's another provision of Massachusetts general law that would cover residency or just the reason that that was not mentioned as regards to the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2474.352s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2475.833s">There's</a>  a lot there. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2478.694s">I</a>  know your most direct question is about the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2481.615s">I</a>  was wondering if maybe chair McDonald or the call center would be able to speak to that.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2499.025s">I</a>  don't remember this coming up in the Charter Commission in the Charter Review Committee meetings and so it could be an oversight but I we do have concerns about residency requirements and in terms of it limits the application pool significantly <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2530.384s">and</a>  it can be perceived as sort of assuring that someone from within gets the job.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2615.175s">You</a>  could, you certainly could. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2616.856s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2617.236s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2617.416s">So</a>  I, if I could, that'd be something that I don't see it in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2622.119s">So</a>  I think that where we can fit that, I think that that's been a concern where we've had commissions or boards of commissions in the city that residents might've been living here and we can understand if they moved out that they finished the term, but we're seeing a lot of people that, that we see people that have been on boards of commissions that don't even live in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2643.577s">So</a>  I think that, you know, finding that language and seeing if that's something we should visit, if that, we could see anything pertaining to that would be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2653.623s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2656.045s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2659.227s">Is</a>  there any, are there any motions or comments, questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2663.95s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2664.27s">If</a>  I can, just make a motion to request friends from the Collins Senate to see if they can draft any, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2673.867s">information</a>  that might be prudent for us to look at and maybe vote on for the possibility of resident requirements for boards and commissions.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2684.756s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2687.598s">I</a>  would move to adopt the amendment to include the city messenger and the charter and <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2697.54s">then</a>  just renumerate, subsection B would become subsection C, subsection D would be, C would become D, and the city messenger section would be subsection B, and that language is also in the document.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2715.568s">I</a>  believe we have two motions on the floor, the first one being Councilor Scarpelli's motion on the residency requirements for the call center to propose draft language for the city council on residency requirements for multiple member boards.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2733.662s">I'd</a>  be happy to try and make my motion with Councilor Scarpelli, so I just take one vote.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2738.245s">And</a>  I assume you're seconding it?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2745.566s">Yeah,</a>  it's all one.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2746.827s">Do</a>  it all together. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2752.69s">Are</a>  there any comments from Chairman Golds before we take that vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2762.196s">Well,</a>  would you have any comments on that resolution or on that motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2769.881s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2773.221s">Yes,</a>  the city messenger and residency requirements for multiple member boards, although that's for a future meeting.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2783.489s">Yeah,</a>  I think it is there, and I think it's two meetings away.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2786.151s">Yeah,</a>  I think that was my recollection as well, but I'm happy to just vote on the motion.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2793.276s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, are you ready? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2794.557s">I</a>  am. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2794.798s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2797.58s">President</a>  Bears? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2798.32s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2800.142s">Vice</a>  President Collins?</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2801.343s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2807.277s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2807.917s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2808.418s">Five</a>  in favor, none opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2809.918s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2812.678s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2816.499s">Now</a>  section two dash eight ordinances and other measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2820.5s">Are</a>  there any comments, questions, motions from, from Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2833.442s">I</a>  know, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2834.632s">There</a>  will be discussion later tonight on the composition, the proposed composition for city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2841.456s">I'm</a>  assuming some of the numbers here will depend on the outcome of those conversations. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2851.168s">I</a>  did have some more technical questions for the Collins Center, if it's all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2856.87s">In</a>  the first line of this section, it says, no ordinance shall be passed finally on the date it is introduced. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2865.472s">Is</a>  that date the first reading of the proposed ordinance? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2871.654s">Is</a>  it when the councilor proposes, like comes to a city council meeting with ordinance text proposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2878.155s">I</a>  know we've had situations where both <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2880.687s">are</a>  happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2881.187s">Of</a>  course, the former being more common. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2883.189s">The</a>  latter has happened in the city council before too.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2886.332s">Yeah,</a>  but it refers to the former.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2889.034s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2897.72s">I</a>  know there's also discussion of emergency ordinances here.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2902.384s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2904.822s">it</a>  makes sense to me, the current language that an emergency ordinance shall be repealed after the expiration of 60 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2912.385s">Is</a>  there much of a, this is something that's new to Medford, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2918.767s">Is</a>  there much of a discussion in terms of whether, of making that vote a repeal vote versus an affirmative vote to enshrine?</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2930.512s">You</a>  can replace the emergency ordinance with something permanent. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2936.705s">So</a>  if that's the direction that you're moving in terms of addressing the issue.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2944.527s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2945.167s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2946.488s">I</a>  believe that's all I had for this section. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2955.169s">Are</a>  there any other comments or questions from councillors? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2960.925s">George,</a>  I've, you has read for some reason, but you didn't have anything, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2966.549s">Great,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2968.651s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2969.492s">Moving</a>  on to section 2-9. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2972.194s">City</a>  council confirmation of certain appointments. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2974.155s">Do</a>  any other, do any councilors have comments or questions on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2977.978s">I</a>  see President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2979.94s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2980.641s">Thank</a>  you Chair Tsang. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2982.802s">This</a>  is the second of the three charter amendments passed in 2020. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2990.703s">three,</a>  I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2994.165s">And</a>  this regards the Council confirming the appointments of the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=2999.629s">The</a>  initial amendment that we had put forward that wasn't advanced to the legislature at the time by the mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3007.513s">would</a>  have had us affirmatively approving all appointments unless otherwise noted by mass general law by majority vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3017.215s">This</a>  has us having to take a specific motion to reject an appointment by a two thirds vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3026.997s">I</a>  do know that there were some concerns by the mayor about having to send all of the appointments to the council and get affirmative. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3036.511s">votes,</a>  I did read through the study committee report and found that that was relatively common. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3045.177s">But</a>  in the spirit of compromise, I can understand that concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3049.82s">And</a>  I would just propose changing the threshold from a two-thirds vote to a majority vote, which also seems to be very common across most communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3059.947s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3080.107s">I</a>  think that's a really good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3081.228s">Uh</a>  do folks from do any other city councilors have thoughts on. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3084.97s">Oh.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3086.511s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3087.692s">Thank</a>  you and appreciate constantly has bringing us forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3089.733s">I</a>  know that, um and the spirit of what I've seen with this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3094.897s">I</a>  think having that majority vote in my opinion is isn't robust enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3100.08s">I</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3108.88s">some</a>  authority and more openness and transparency when it comes to positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3114.044s">I</a>  know that one of the biggest things we've seen over the last couple of years is that the positions that are created that this council doesn't even vote for. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3122.931s">And</a>  that's happened multiple times, not just with this council, but previous councils. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3130.357s">So</a>  I think lessening that and giving the mayor's office more of autonomy to make these decisions <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3138.996s">without</a>  a more weighted process that really makes it accountable for the position that she's presenting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3155.589s">I</a>  think I would rather see the two-thirds vote for the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3162.334s">That</a>  meat is needed.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3163.615s">So</a>  I think my opinions, I don't disagree if I make sure I don't disagree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3169.1s">So</a>  this, the way it's written without my amendment is the council would need two thirds to reject. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3176.305s">So</a>  we wouldn't see everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3178.743s">that</a>  we would only appointments would be made and then we would have 30 days to say we don't want that appointment and then it will require two thirds to reject that appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3188.23s">So</a>  it's not saying they would come before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3190.171s">I</a>  actually agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3191.132s">I</a>  support. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3191.712s">Yeah,</a>  I would support if someone else wanted to move in that direction more. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3196.448s">affirmative</a>  process where all of the appointments come before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3200.449s">But</a>  in the absence of that, I don't think it should require two-thirds for rejection. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3204.85s">I</a>  think it should require just a simple majority to reject an appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3208.131s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3208.671s">I</a>  misunderstood.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3209.771s">I</a>  just wanted to note that we... I'm reading the red line as I'm reading the original, so... Yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3214.652s">I</a>  appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3216.113s">I</a>  withdraw. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3216.693s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3217.093s">Yeah,</a>  I just wanted to... I completely agree with your sentiment on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3219.914s">I</a>  want us to be able to have more authority as regards appointments.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3226.594s">I</a>  know, so right now, just to summarize, we are debating or we are discussing changing the requirements that city council reject mayoral appointees with a two-thirds majority, changing that, amending that to just the majority, a majority to reject an appointee, just to frame this conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3249.93s">Do</a>  any other councilors have comments on that proposal, on President Bears's motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3263.239s">Is</a>  there any comment from the Charter Study Committee, from Collin Sentry? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3268.641s">Seeing</a>  none, do we have a second for President Bears' motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3275.963s">I'll</a>  second. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3276.963s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3306.451s">I</a>  just want to read this back, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3309.974s">President</a>  Bears, would you include language that a rejection of certain mayoral appointments can be done by a majority vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3316.66s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3316.9s">Is</a>  that how you want that? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3317.781s">It's</a>  the recommendation that the state supports that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3322.866s">I'll</a>  second if the Council is compelling. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3327.37s">President</a>  Bears? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3328.171s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3328.851s">Vice</a>  President Collins?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3353.887s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3354.607s">Some</a>  of them would pertain if there was a change in the proposed composition. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3358.809s">So</a>  I'll hold those, but we did receive a communication and I noted as well from the chair of the elections commission that the references to the city clerk in here should be references to the elections commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3373.835s">And</a>  so I would move to make those changes, but I'm also just want to see if that is an issue or if the comment center representatives have any <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3384.696s">notes</a>  on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3385.516s">If</a>  it should stay as city clerk because we technically adopted a law that said the Elections Commission shall act as city clerk and therefore there are Massachusetts general laws that reference the clerk and not the commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3397.079s">But</a>  that seems kind of convoluted.</p>

    <p>[Wright]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3401.1s">We</a>  can certainly revisit state law and make sure everything's in compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3408.541s">Get</a>  to the point where we bring together the final draft.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3412.216s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3412.856s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3412.996s">I</a>  just think we did hear that note that, I mean, we have the elections commission model. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3417.057s">We</a>  adopted the mass general law provision. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3419.537s">I</a>  can't remember what it is now, a couple of years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3422.378s">So</a>  we have an elections commission running the elections, not the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3426.279s">So</a>  I'll just move to put that in our notes to the call center as they, so that they can make sure that that is accurate in the final draft. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3453.355s">reflect</a>  the system that we are operating under.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3460.462s">Sorry,</a>  Councilor Collins is telling me that my mic was not on. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3465.347s">For</a>  Councilor Collins, President Bears has made a motion to request that the Collins Center <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3470.826s">look</a>  at section 2-10, make sure that the references to the city clerk and the election commissions reflect the system that we operate here. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3485.174s">I</a>  did have one more substance-based question for the members of the Collins Center or the Charter Study Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3492.819s">I</a>  know that there, so there's a reference to, so there's a less than 30% mark. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3500.216s">for</a>  filling the vacancies. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3503.298s">This</a>  is something that I find reasonable, but I'm curious how he arrived at 30% as a number. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3520.851s">Chair</a>  McDonald? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3522.712s">Oh</a>  yeah, could you come to the microphone so folks at home and other Councilors can hear? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3530.028s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3530.528s">Hi,</a>  Milva McDonald, 61 Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3534.369s">As</a>  part of the discussion, we looked at other charters and we talked about it and that seemed like a reasonable provision, so we included it.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3544.192s">I</a>  see. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3545.913s">Are</a>  there charters that go, maybe this is a question that the call-in center would know more.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3550.774s">There</a>  are some that go to 40%. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3552.055s">It's</a>  30, there are probably a couple at 25.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3561.037s">I</a>  see, so 30 is more of like a median number?</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3563.238s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3565.059s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3568.021s">Are</a>  there any other questions or comments on section 210 from councillors?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3576.446s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3577.886s">President</a>  Bears? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3582.749s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3583.51s">I</a>  did the wrong mic.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3586.849s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3587.409s">Yeah,</a>  I just, I would have some concerns at 30% if the composition of the council were to be as proposed by the study committee, because there'd be a lot of one-on-one races for seats. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3600.054s">And</a>  I would think that in that situation, a 30% result would be not representative. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3609.378s">So</a>  I just want to note that composition wise, that would be a concern for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3614.946s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3615.506s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3616.667s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3616.988s">President</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3618.269s">Um,</a>  it's my opinion is similar. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3620.731s">I</a>  didn't want to, um, well, I can't make any motions from the chair, but I also didn't want to make any proposals before we moved before we talked about composition. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3630.899s">Um,</a>  because I think a lot of this, this does hinge on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3635.743s">Are</a>  there any motions of councils are, um, I actually have a question on that.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3641.228s">The,</a>  so <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3644.635s">If</a>  a vacancy occurs in the office of Councilor at large, that position is filled by, is it pulled from one of the ward Councilors based on votes received? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3661.125s">I'm</a>  confused about. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3662.866s">Or</a>  one of the people who was running for at large, as long as they didn't get less than 30, but you had to have been running for at large.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3671.571s">It's</a>  my understanding that it's the latter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3673.252s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3674.653s">The</a>  call center is confirmed, just for folks watching online. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3678.075s">Got</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3682.036s">Got</a>  it.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3682.597s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3684.358s">I</a>  know vacancies is something that we talked about in my charter study committee interview way back when. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3691.681s">We</a>  talked about different ways of looking at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3695.183s">I</a>  know there are a lot of arguments that cut in favor of keeping it this way as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3703.531s">I</a>  know the main criticism with having the next runner-up fill the seat is that, as President Bears referred to, the next runner-up might not be representative of the will of the voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3716.263s">But</a>  there is also a worry that we would end up having to run a lot of special elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3721.428s">That</a>  costs money and time and operational energy at City Hall as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3727.733s">So</a>  something to consider as we move forward, but I do think that a lot of this does hinge on the conversation about competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3736.755s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3738.395s">If</a>  I can, I think that with the professionals from the Collins Center, 40% sounds like a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3747.257s">What</a>  would you recommend? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3749.398s">What</a>  have you seen that really works and where that middle ground where the, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3756.863s">extra</a>  one-on-one elections that might cost the city money.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3759.864s">To</a>  me, it's the process, but... Well, I think there's also really concern about low turnout at special elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3769.027s">So</a>  that's not representative of what the electorate might want. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3775.23s">At</a>  least in choosing the runner up, if they got 30% of the vote, at least you know that they attracted some attention.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3784.748s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3785.368s">And</a>  people thought that they could serve.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3788.349s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3788.83s">And</a>  that's my fear. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3791.371s">We're</a>  seeing what's coming out in local elections recently in Medford, you know, with 60,000 residents and 40,000, 35,000, 40,000 voters and only 13,000, 14,000, 15,000 coming out. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3798.333s">I</a>  think that would pose a problem for the process, you know, going any higher.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3818.443s">Right,</a>  those who participated in that election.</p>

    <p>[Wright]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3821.524s">It's</a>  votes cast. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3823.665s">Yeah,</a>  it's votes cast, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3827.147s">And</a>  keep in mind, it's for the remainder of the existing term. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3831.529s">So</a>  they're not getting a full term.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3834.63s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Wright]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3835.13s">They're</a>  only completing a two-year term. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3839.572s">And</a>  they do not get to put on, if they run for the seat after the end of that term. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3846.441s">They</a>  are not candidates for re-election. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3848.822s">We</a>  will not say that.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3851.784s">President</a>  Bears, to that point in your research, have you found there to be a significant difference in incumbency bias between someone who has the label candidate for re-election and someone who doesn't, even if they were serving?</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3865.291s">No,</a>  I've never seen a study on it.</p>

    <p>[Wright]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3873.775s">There's</a>  a perception, there is a perception, and there also can be, in some communities, a designation that candidates for re-election are put at the top of the ticket.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3888.702s">Right,</a>  which I think this charter gets rid of.</p>

    <p>[Wright]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3891.524s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3891.964s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3893.685s">I'm</a>  just wondering how much, if you had any knowledge on how much that benefit to incumbents <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3899.629s">is</a>  literally the label on the ballot or being able to put Councilor X on their literature or just being in the meetings.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3907.17s">I</a>  think just being on the council, it's a familiar name.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3913.812s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3914.332s">You've</a>  seen it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3916.172s">It's</a>  familiarity, I think.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3918.493s">Yeah,</a>  that's just where I think, I understand why to say, oh, they wouldn't be able to put that on the ballot, but I don't know that that <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3929.137s">I'll</a>  get to my point around that when we talk about composition of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3932.708s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3934.574s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3937.228s">I</a>  just wanted to clarify that the current text of the ordinance or of the draft city charter is that if they don't reach that 30% threshold, not that we would hold a special election. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3948.656s">So</a>  if we amended that number, it wouldn't be that we hold a special election. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3953.38s">The</a>  current draft charter says the remaining members of the city council would appoint to fill the vacancy for the rest of the term. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3961.026s">That's</a>  in subsection C. Just to clarify that point for folks at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3967.904s">That</a>  is something that we could change as a council, right, but I don't hear any appetite to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3975.473s">Yes,</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3977.816s">I</a>  would just note of all of those options that being selected by duly elected people versus low turnout special election versus low threshold of voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3986.506s">being</a>  a selection being made by the rest of the council is probably the most representative of the will of the people in that situation, because the people elected the other Councilors. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3996.088s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3997.128s">Thank</a>  you, President Ferris. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=3998.388s">I</a>  know we have one motion from President Ferris on the floor regarding... There's the Elections Commission, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4009.731s">Do</a>  we have a second for that motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4014.492s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4015.252s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, when you're ready.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4060.766s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4061.367s">Five</a>  in favor and unopposed motion passes now on to the fun part. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4066.811s">If</a>  that wasn't fun enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4069.934s">Oh</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4070.354s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4071.035s">Sorry.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4071.911s">9.6</a>  slipped my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4073.032s">One</a>  more fun section before we get to the big topic items. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4077.994s">Are</a>  there any comments on section 9-6? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4081.396s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4088.66s">President</a>  Bears and then Councilor Wood.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4092.262s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4094.523s">And</a>  I appreciate you including this in this meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4099.41s">as</a>  I was going through a section 9-6 in the existing charter's periodic review of ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4105.374s">And</a>  to me, ordinances are the purview of the legislative branch. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4109.397s">Of</a>  course, the mayor has the ability to sign or veto, but the ordinance authority lies with the legislative branch. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4117.263s">And</a>  to me, I believe that we should move this section 9-6 to section 2. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4123.908s">I</a>  relabel it section 2-11. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4127.612s">and</a>  then I would make two minor changes, which would be that the city council shall provide for a review. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4133.776s">Right</a>  now it says the mayor and city council, and I would just change that to read the city council, and that the review shall be made by a special committee to be established by ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4143.663s">I</a>  would change that to be established by a vote of the city council.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4146.405s">Okay,</a>  we have a motion from President Bears on a number of amendments, but <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4153.915s">namely</a>  that the special committee be established by a vote at the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4158.779s">Do</a>  we have a second for that motion? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4161.841s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4163.122s">Before</a>  we take that- It would be a motion to adopt the language as I propose.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4167.185s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4167.605s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4169.227s">And</a>  we all have that language from the agenda packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4172.509s">Councilor</a>  Lemie?</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4174.951s">Thank</a>  you, Chair Sang, for letting me speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4178.594s">Just</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4179.418s">To</a>  clarify for the folks at home, neither Councilor Callahan nor I are on this committee, which means that we can't vote or make motions, but we are at the invitation of the chair able to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4195.685s">The</a>  one concern that I had was eliminating the part that says the mayor and city council is that you likely would need some support from the executive branch when advertising for the positions that go <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4212.131s">that</a>  would go into that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4213.652s">So</a>  it would help to, you know, have the support from the executive branch to be able to put out feelers. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4220.514s">I</a>  fully support having it be confirmed by having them be confirmed by a vote of the city council, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4225.795s">So</a>  that's just that's just one thought as a potential consequence of removing the mayor and city council, keeping it just city councils that I think would be you do need some staff support for this kind of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4239.6s">I</a>  would imagine. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4241.12s">Um</a>  And also the city solicitor would be Under under the mayor as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4248.068s">So</a>  that's another concern I would have with removing that explicitly. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4252.594s">I</a>  did have some questions about this for the call in center. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4257.599s">If</a>  I'm if I'm able, um <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4261.271s">So</a>  this struck me as a, so two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4267.556s">One,</a>  is this something that is typically in ordinances in other cities? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4271.318s">And</a>  if so, what usually results from that? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4278.424s">So</a>  have there been, are there usually like pretty substantial changes that come out of this? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4283.247s">committees,</a>  periodic reviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4285.809s">Are</a>  there any specific instances you can think of where this might have affected policy in the past? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4292.414s">I</a>  just feel like a little bit more historical context would help me out with this one.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4296.418s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4297.598s">This</a>  is very common in charters that you go through a periodic review of the ordinances following a review of the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4308.447s">What</a>  we're trying to guarantee is that those two documents stay in harmony <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4313.388s">you</a>  know, for the time, but you understand what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4324.271s">We</a>  don't want one to say one thing and one the other.</p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4327.592s">So</a>  the real point of this is to make sure that the ordinances are consistent with any updates to the charter.</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4333.913s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Matt Leming]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4334.554s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4335.414s">And</a>  the other is you can then update from any <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4340.952s">references</a>  to state law, any changes to state law that affect your structure and organization that would be in the ordinances, that would be a time that you could make that change.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4351.822s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4352.942s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4356.365s">I</a>  know there was a question for Councilor Fleming about the proposed motion, President</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4366.235s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4366.535s">Yeah,</a>  given Councilor Lemmy's comment, I'm happy to amend my proposal to not strike the words mayor and, and then I also just noticed that I also should have changed that the special committee shall file its report with the city clerk on a date specified by a vote of the city council instead of by ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4385.679s">So</a>  I would just further amend my proposal based on Councilor Lemmy's comment and based on that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4391.94s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4393.36s">Could</a>  you? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4394.821s">I'll</a>  email it. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4396.703s">Councilor</a>  Callaghan, and then Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Anna Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4404.165s">Thanks.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4404.525s">I</a>  just had one quick question, which I think Councilor Bears may have just answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4410.547s">It's</a>  not clear to me who is on the committee or who puts people on the committee, but it sounds like what Councilor Bears is suggesting is that it says, this review shall be made by a special committee to be established by a vote of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4424.371s">So</a>  that would be the council that is <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4426.864s">I</a>  just wanted to understand what that. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4430.026s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4430.466s">This</a>  is a suggestion to amend</p>

    <p>[Emily Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4455.857s">If</a>  the intention of this would be to make the ordinances be in alignment with an updated charter, maybe it could say, with every change to the charter, may there be an update or a review of ordinances to align with the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4473.109s">This</a>  section looks like, and it does say at five-year intervals and each year ending in a seven or a two, it doesn't say every time you update the charter, you'll review all the ordinances to see that they're in alignment with the charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4485.975s">So</a>  there's no implication in this language that that is why it's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4491.88s">To</a>  me, I read this and I thought it was saying there's a special committee appointed to read all of the local ordinances of the city and review them, which I always understood to be the work of city council and what we're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4506.893s">on</a>  a regular basis anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4509.034s">So</a>  I thought this was at best redundant as a section to work that's already being done. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4517.639s">So</a>  maybe I think my amendment to President Bears's motion would be to say, upon review or changes made to the city charter, <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4535.436s">and</a>  then the rest of this section.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4538.639s">It's</a>  my understanding from the Collins Center's earlier comment that it's not just for city charter changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4545.505s">It's</a>  also when Massachusetts state law changes.</p>

    <p>[Jessica Healey]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4548.347s">As</a>  the state law changes.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4549.608s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4550.449s">And</a>  it's mostly to do with your structure and organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4555.333s">It's</a>  not a comprehensive review in the sense that you have to go through every licensing arrangement, especially if it hasn't changed.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4566.887s">I</a>  think what would be helpful to folks at home and for Councilors is, because Benford hasn't had something like this, at least not under the present form of the charter, could you give us a look into, I think you've described the role, like what they would be doing, but what does this committee typically look like? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4583.893s">Is</a>  it composed of lawyers?</p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4588.055s">Sometimes</a>  it's composed, not totally of lawyers, but usually <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4593.219s">a</a>  lawyer, maybe a current Councilor, a former Councilor, someone with familiarity with the work, maybe a member of the planning board or the school committee, just willing to get different voices in the sense of their perception of how this ordinance has or has not worked. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4617.67s">Is</a>  it meeting the intent when you have to? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4624.652s">anybody</a>  seeing any glitches or hitches that you could propose to modify.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4630.818s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4631.238s">I</a>  think that helps a lot with with our understanding of what this is meant to meant to be.</p>

    <p>[Paulette Van der Kloot]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4637.583s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4638.404s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4639.705s">I</a>  know President Bears has requested the mic. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4642.828s">I</a>  also did have a question for Okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4646.371s">I</a>  did have a question for President Bears in by changing the first <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4652.12s">It's</a>  the first reference to the ordinance to a vote of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4655.701s">I</a>  know. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4655.921s">And</a>  then two sentences from there, it says on a shelf file, it's report with the city clerk on a date specified by ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4664.144s">OK.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4681.851s">Give</a>  us a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4682.612s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Contreas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4689.384s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4722.047s">Great,</a>  on President Bears' motion, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4726.649s">President</a>  Bears, oh, sorry.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4742.555s">This</a>  motion would move section 9-6 to article 2, make it section 2-11. <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4750.368s">It</a>  would then change the words by ordinance to by vote of the City Council, both in the second sentence and the fourth sentence.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4769.293s">Do</a>  we still have your second on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/aHlZXhM2wEw&t=4773.915s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, when you're ready.</p>
