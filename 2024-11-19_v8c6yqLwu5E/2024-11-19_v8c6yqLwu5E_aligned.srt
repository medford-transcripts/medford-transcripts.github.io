Hello guys, I can't hear any of you.

37
00:02:38,297 --> 00:02:39,918
It looks like all of you guys are on mute.

38
00:02:39,938 --> 00:02:41,438
This is Sterling from National Grid.

39
00:02:47,204 --> 00:02:51,808
It looks like we temporarily lost that chamber sound, but it seems like they're back on.

40
00:02:55,372 --> 00:02:55,592
Yes.

41
00:02:56,213 --> 00:03:02,239
I think that the chamber, the council chambers, they weren't, it was not in the zoom room for a moment, but it looks like it's back.

42
00:03:04,559 --> 00:03:05,980
Yeah, I hear everyone now, thank you.

43
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:10,982
I'm gonna let Abdel, not bad, he's the one handling this.

44
00:03:11,042 --> 00:03:12,183
Excuse me, excuse me.

45
00:03:14,224 --> 00:03:18,826
I have to read the meeting notice and then at that point I will recognize you and we will begin the process.

46
00:03:18,866 --> 00:03:19,506
I'm so sorry, okay.

00:05:21,899 --> 00:05:26,782
pole on Mitchell Ave beginning at a point approximately 14 feet east of the center line.

79
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:59,542
At this point in time, I would open up the public hearing to those in favor of the petition.

80
00:07:00,242 --> 00:07:03,764
Is there anyone with us tonight that is in favor of the petition that would like to speak?

81
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:12,947
So we have, there was someone from Verizon, right?

82
00:07:13,647 --> 00:07:14,547
Oh, okay, so let's see.

83
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:15,688
National Grid, I'm sorry.

84
00:07:17,628 --> 00:07:24,810
Hello everyone, this is Sterling Ortiz from National Grid.

85
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:28,412
Abdel, not bad, he's also an engineer for NASA.

86
00:07:29,912 --> 00:07:30,712
Abdel, okay.

87
00:07:32,593 --> 00:07:33,213
He's muted.

88
00:07:35,842 --> 00:07:40,684
Sterling has been unmuted and there was one other person, I believe.

89
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:45,046
Oh, okay.

90
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:47,107
It looks like everyone's frozen.

91
00:07:47,187 --> 00:07:47,707
It's on.

92
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:52,930
Abdel, go ahead.

93
00:07:56,471 --> 00:07:57,312
Sterling, can you hear us?

94
00:08:11,568 --> 00:08:15,971
We should switch to Verizon.

95
00:08:16,031 --> 00:08:19,093
Let's see, Sterling, can you hear us?

96
00:08:21,534 --> 00:08:22,134
No.

97
00:08:22,935 --> 00:08:23,555
Thanks, Sterling.

98
00:08:23,575 --> 00:08:26,657
Sterling, you're making some changes.

99
00:08:26,677 --> 00:08:27,878
So now West Coast and Sterling?

100
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:31,300
Sterling?

101
00:08:35,562 --> 00:08:36,143
Abdelawad?

102
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:42,851
Sterling, can you hear me?

103
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:47,094
Councilor Morrell, can you hear me?

104
00:08:47,814 --> 00:08:48,755
I can hear you now, yeah.

105
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:51,617
It looks like we lost the chambers again and now they're back.

106
00:08:51,897 --> 00:08:52,258
Okay.

107
00:08:54,219 --> 00:08:55,560
So let's see, so we have.

108
00:08:57,037 --> 00:09:04,438
Abdelwahed Nabat, here on behalf of National Grid Electric at 170 Medford Street, Malden.

109
00:09:04,798 --> 00:09:12,440
And I'm here tonight to request permission to install a joint owned pole between National Grid and Verizon New England.

110
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:17,020
The pole will be installed on Mitchell Avenue.

111
00:09:19,901 --> 00:09:21,821
A lot of static, not sure if you heard that.

112
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:23,361
Yes, we did hear that.

113
00:09:23,381 --> 00:09:25,522
So you are in favor of the petition.

114
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:32,052
Is there anybody else in favor of the petition that would like to speak at this point?

115
00:09:35,974 --> 00:09:38,575
Okay, hearing and seeing none, this portion of the hearing is closed.

116
00:09:39,736 --> 00:09:42,397
Is there anyone in opposition of the petition that would like to speak?

117
00:09:42,477 --> 00:09:43,357
Anyone in opposition?

118
00:09:43,377 --> 00:09:53,602
Okay, hearing and seeing none, I declare this portion of the hearing closed.

119
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,745
Are there any questions from the council regarding this petition?

120
00:10:00,046 --> 00:10:00,646
Councilor Knight.

121
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:08,347
Does the petitioner have a rendering that would indicate how close to the nearest driveway apron this poll will be located?

122
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:22,450
Councilman, I believe this poll is to be installed away from any driveway.

123
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:25,791
At the moment, I don't have,

124
00:10:27,784 --> 00:10:28,244
The drawing.

125
00:10:31,287 --> 00:10:41,715
And I believe this, so this poll is actually to accommodate for the building of a new house that's going up on Mitchell Avenue.

126
00:10:42,116 --> 00:10:45,298
I believe the address is 88 Mitchell Avenue.

127
00:10:48,921 --> 00:10:49,101
Okay.

128
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:56,207
So this is an additional poll, like at the end of the line per se, say the street ended and this is going to be a poll at the end of the street.

129
00:10:57,118 --> 00:10:57,418
Yes.

130
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:02,602
Further provide electricity to our, uh, I guess it'd be electric and phone services.

131
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:04,303
Yes.

132
00:11:04,323 --> 00:11:05,484
Thank you very much.

133
00:11:06,905 --> 00:11:07,165
Thank you.

134
00:11:07,505 --> 00:11:07,746
Thank you.

135
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:08,206
Councilor Knight.

136
00:11:08,686 --> 00:11:09,927
Any other questions from the council?

137
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,049
Councilor Scarpelli.

138
00:11:13,329 --> 00:11:14,010
Thank you, Mr. President.

139
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,191
This is a quick question.

140
00:11:15,851 --> 00:11:18,373
This, when it says double, it's not two poles, correct?

141
00:11:19,743 --> 00:11:20,283
No, it is not.

142
00:11:20,303 --> 00:11:22,484
Okay, we just want to make sure because I know we've had issues.

143
00:11:22,504 --> 00:11:23,225
It's a single poll.

144
00:11:23,445 --> 00:11:27,106
Okay, I know we've had issues in the past with double polls.

145
00:11:27,126 --> 00:11:31,868
We're still waiting for some relief and taking a few down in the community.

146
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:39,372
So just wanted to make sure so constituents that are listening don't misunderstand that there is two polls, so it's only one.

147
00:11:39,472 --> 00:11:40,012
Thank you very much.

148
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:41,232
You're welcome.

149
00:11:41,453 --> 00:11:42,053
Thank you, Councilor.

150
00:11:42,073 --> 00:11:44,514
Scott Pelli, any other questions from the council?

151
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:46,840
There's one, Mr. President.

152
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:51,422
Upon approval, when will the construction commence and how long will it take?

153
00:11:51,442 --> 00:12:02,449
I believe when it will start is a little further away, but once it gets started, we're there until we're finished.

154
00:12:02,709 --> 00:12:06,971
And installing a pole can be as quick as a couple hours.

155
00:12:08,032 --> 00:12:12,935
And sometimes it could be five, six hours at the most, including the digging of,

156
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:16,712
the sidewalk, if there's any sidewalks.

157
00:12:17,212 --> 00:12:22,214
So overall construction can be no more than five hours, I would say.

158
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:23,015
Less than a full day.

159
00:12:23,635 --> 00:12:24,235
All right, excellent.

160
00:12:24,615 --> 00:12:25,556
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

161
00:12:25,576 --> 00:12:26,016
I'm satisfied.

162
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,497
I have no problem supporting this paper this evening.

163
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:28,717
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

164
00:12:29,297 --> 00:12:30,858
Any other questions from the council?

165
00:12:30,878 --> 00:12:31,458
Mr. President.

166
00:12:31,558 --> 00:12:32,198
Councilor Marks.

167
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,359
Just a clarification.

168
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:41,482
On the legal notice that was sent, it says that new joint poll P2818,

169
00:12:45,673 --> 00:12:49,014
And then if you look at the schematic, it says P3818.

170
00:13:01,059 --> 00:13:05,841
So on the legal notice on the first page, it says poll 2818, and then the schematic says 3818.

171
00:13:11,463 --> 00:13:14,024
Mr. Kosterman, I believe that is just an error.

172
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:23,050
the pole that is gonna be installed, it will be numbered 3818, and it is 60 feet northeast of pole 3817.

173
00:13:28,955 --> 00:13:36,922
So it appears that there'll be a pole 3817, looks like it's on the property line of 97 and 93 Mitchell.

174
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:37,162
Yep.

175
00:13:40,982 --> 00:13:49,685
and then pole 3818 looks like it's on the property line of zero Mitchell, which is probably a lot of vacant lot.

176
00:13:50,985 --> 00:13:53,186
It is where the new house will be installed.

177
00:13:53,246 --> 00:14:02,749
I believe it has already, they broke ground there and it looks like it's going to be the new reference point between house 93 and the lot 88.

178
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:02,869
Okay.

179
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:11,511
Is that common to have telephone poles that close?

180
00:14:14,973 --> 00:14:19,975
So this is a geo pole that is between Medford.

181
00:14:20,475 --> 00:14:32,641
It's in Medford where Medford allows for a pole to accommodate for telephone, as well as for national grid equipments to be installed on the poles.

182
00:14:34,002 --> 00:14:35,643
Will this pole have a street light on it?

183
00:14:38,550 --> 00:14:43,774
I think that when it comes to street lights, I believe the street lights are owned by the city of Medford.

184
00:14:44,514 --> 00:14:51,619
And when they do want street lights installed on poles, they can reach to national grid.

185
00:14:51,739 --> 00:14:55,742
As of right now, this pole does not include any street lighting.

186
00:14:56,422 --> 00:15:06,609
And I'm not sure whether the city of Medford requested the owner of lot 88 to install any street lights when building the house.

187
00:15:09,522 --> 00:15:09,822
Okay.

188
00:15:10,763 --> 00:15:11,364
Okay, thank you.

189
00:15:11,384 --> 00:15:13,205
You're welcome, Councilor.

190
00:15:13,665 --> 00:15:14,466
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

191
00:15:16,168 --> 00:15:16,628
Councilor Knight.

192
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:21,432
Mr. President, I didn't realize that we had a copy of the rendering in our package as I went through it.

193
00:15:21,492 --> 00:15:22,953
I bypassed that.

194
00:15:23,954 --> 00:15:35,483
And in looking at the rendering, if we look at number 93 Mitchell Avenue, on each side of the property line, there is a existing, there will be a telephone pole, and then we'll be putting a new pole in.

195
00:15:36,417 --> 00:15:50,305
Now, unless that house doesn't have a driveway, or the driveway goes right down the middle of the property, it looks like this pole is going to be very close to the driveway at 93 Mitchell Avenue, should they have one.

196
00:15:52,766 --> 00:16:05,433
And I'd hate to get into a situation where we approve a pole to go up in a location where if we move it five or six feet in one direction or the other, we would improve someone's access to their drive.

197
00:16:08,567 --> 00:16:10,988
Is the city engineer on the call by any chance, Mr. President?

198
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:14,550
I do not see him on the call.

199
00:16:28,176 --> 00:16:28,876
Thank you, Mr. President.

200
00:16:29,936 --> 00:16:30,857
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

201
00:16:34,098 --> 00:16:35,979
Are there any other questions from the council?

202
00:16:42,355 --> 00:16:43,796
Mr. President?

203
00:16:44,496 --> 00:16:47,358
I'm sure the abutters were notified as well, correct?

204
00:16:48,659 --> 00:16:53,262
I'm sure the abutters were notified as well, correct?

205
00:17:11,535 --> 00:17:11,855
Thank you.

206
00:17:12,215 --> 00:17:12,656
Thank you.

207
00:17:16,757 --> 00:17:17,478
Motion for approval.

208
00:17:17,498 --> 00:17:21,520
Mr. President, a motion of console marks to approve.

209
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:23,581
Seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

210
00:17:23,621 --> 00:17:24,221
Clerk her to be.

211
00:17:24,321 --> 00:17:27,723
Please call the roll council bears.

212
00:17:27,863 --> 00:17:28,083
Yes.

213
00:17:28,723 --> 00:17:29,143
Vice president.

214
00:17:29,163 --> 00:17:29,663
Carabiello.

215
00:17:29,703 --> 00:17:30,044
Yes.

216
00:17:30,524 --> 00:17:31,024
Council night.

217
00:17:31,744 --> 00:17:32,025
Yes.

218
00:17:33,685 --> 00:17:34,266
Council marks.

219
00:17:34,866 --> 00:17:35,166
Yes.

220
00:17:35,566 --> 00:17:36,166
Council Morrell.

221
00:17:36,747 --> 00:17:36,947
Yes.

222
00:17:37,543 --> 00:17:38,404
Councilor Scarpelli?

223
00:17:38,585 --> 00:17:38,825
Yes.

224
00:17:38,945 --> 00:17:39,686
President Fevella?

225
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:40,227
Yes.

226
00:17:40,388 --> 00:17:41,730
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

227
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:42,591
The motion passes.

228
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:43,512
Thank you.

229
00:17:46,056 --> 00:17:46,337
Thank you.

230
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:46,878
Happy New Year.

231
00:17:47,579 --> 00:17:48,080
Happy New Year.

232
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,781
Thank you very much.

233
00:17:51,982 --> 00:18:07,269
Motions, orders, and resolutions 20-675 offered by Council of Bears be resolved by the Memphis City Council that the updates on the COVID-19 mitigation actions and COVID-19 safety enforcement actions requested at the Council's December 8th meeting be presented.

234
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,250
Council of Bears.

235
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:09,629
Thank you, Mr. President.

236
00:18:09,889 --> 00:18:12,831
And I know we tabled this for one week last week.

237
00:18:14,572 --> 00:18:31,442
I do want to thank health director O'Connor for sending a pretty detailed memorandum to the council, answering some of our questions and discussing some of the mitigation strategies and plans that they are undertaking given the new surge upon surge of coronavirus cases in the city.

238
00:18:32,663 --> 00:18:36,025
Do we have the health director on the call or a representative of the city administration?

239
00:18:38,276 --> 00:18:38,817
Yes, she is.

240
00:18:38,857 --> 00:18:39,877
Marianne O'Connor is with us.

241
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:49,606
It would be great to just hear maybe a, this is a detailed memo, so I don't know if you'd have to go through all of it, but maybe mentioning some of the highlights, especially around mitigation and enforcement.

242
00:18:49,826 --> 00:18:50,687
Okay.

243
00:18:50,707 --> 00:18:51,928
Marianne, you have the floor.

244
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:54,911
Good evening everyone.

245
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:55,791
Thank you.

246
00:18:55,831 --> 00:19:04,619
So while this was just a week ago, obviously there's been changes as this thing changes rapidly.

247
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:05,080
So

248
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:12,355
As of the update last week, I had told you there were 2,500 positive cases since the beginning.

249
00:19:12,375 --> 00:19:16,317
We are now up over 2,700 cases, 2,781 to be exact.

250
00:19:16,397 --> 00:19:22,721
Since 12-15, since this report was written, there's been an additional 180 cases in the last week.

251
00:19:22,741 --> 00:19:24,583
As of Thanksgiving, we've had 912 cases.

252
00:19:37,263 --> 00:19:40,365
as of the day after Thanksgiving.

253
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:50,330
Also, you'll see in this, there was an update around, as of last week, we're in phase three, step one of the state reopening plan.

254
00:19:51,471 --> 00:19:59,095
I'm sure many of you are aware now that the governor today announced additional updates to his governor's order.

255
00:20:00,035 --> 00:20:04,578
Basically, most significantly, I guess, affecting

256
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:15,792
All of those businesses that had a 40% capacity have now been reduced to a 25% capacity, including restaurants.

257
00:20:16,633 --> 00:20:21,599
Up until this point, restaurants have really, their capacity limit was really

258
00:20:22,819 --> 00:20:30,723
around how many tables they could fit with the six foot social distancing, not really tied to a capacity limit.

259
00:20:31,263 --> 00:20:34,605
However, now they are tied to a capacity limit of 25%.

260
00:20:35,185 --> 00:20:50,773
For places that don't have a pre-COVID established capacity limit, what we're gonna have to use is five people per thousand square feet.

261
00:20:51,814 --> 00:20:55,998
as the capacity limit.

262
00:20:56,198 --> 00:21:07,729
So it's pretty significant for a lot of these businesses to be cut down, including retail, places of worship are going from 40% to 25% as per the governor's orders today.

263
00:21:13,894 --> 00:21:17,237
Again, some of these things have changed because of that.

264
00:21:18,659 --> 00:21:24,325
But as far as our mitigation efforts, they are strongly the same.

265
00:21:24,345 --> 00:21:31,332
We react, respond to every complaint, every concern.

266
00:21:32,613 --> 00:21:37,498
We have a mailing going out shortly to every household.

267
00:21:37,618 --> 00:21:38,859
We have lawn signs.

268
00:21:38,959 --> 00:21:39,960
We have signage.

269
00:21:40,741 --> 00:21:41,682
We have

270
00:21:42,298 --> 00:21:48,780
constantly contacted businesses, trying to keep them up to date with the most recent guidelines.

271
00:21:49,460 --> 00:22:01,244
An email was already sent out today to all of the businesses for which we have an email address for surrounding the new governance orders and the capacity limits.

272
00:22:03,805 --> 00:22:06,906
We are doing our best to keep up with the cases.

273
00:22:07,886 --> 00:22:09,807
Our policy around enforcement

274
00:22:10,745 --> 00:22:12,626
is always education first.

275
00:22:13,727 --> 00:22:16,829
We are there to educate and support.

276
00:22:16,849 --> 00:22:24,255
We do not like to use enforcement measures, but we will, and we have.

277
00:22:24,715 --> 00:22:32,761
And we have found most businesses to be extremely compliant and helpful.

278
00:22:33,762 --> 00:22:35,183
Some need a little assistance.

279
00:22:37,124 --> 00:22:39,726
We've supplied them with signage whenever requested.

280
00:22:41,337 --> 00:22:44,499
given them any kind of masks or support they need.

281
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:53,242
But if we have constant and continual complaints, or we are alerted to certain situations, we do respond.

282
00:22:54,322 --> 00:23:05,007
The way the state has us structured is a verbal warning first, followed by a written warning, followed by a fine structure.

283
00:23:05,827 --> 00:23:08,188
That's in place for the different regulations.

284
00:23:13,052 --> 00:23:14,153
I don't know if there's anything.

285
00:23:14,173 --> 00:23:16,414
I know it was a five-page long memo.

286
00:23:16,814 --> 00:23:22,176
A little bit easier for me to write down with my COVID brain right now than to speak, but.

287
00:23:22,917 --> 00:23:24,997
Yeah, I just want to say thank you.

288
00:23:25,058 --> 00:23:26,098
I think that was a great summary.

289
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:28,279
I'm sure that councilors will have questions.

290
00:23:28,359 --> 00:23:30,860
But I just want to say thank you again, Mary.

291
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,842
And I know this has been an unimaginable nine months.

292
00:23:33,922 --> 00:23:37,903
It's been very difficult on everyone in the city and on our Board of Health.

293
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,545
So I just want to thank you for everything you've been doing.

294
00:23:41,486 --> 00:24:00,027
for this past year to keep Medford residents safe and hopefully the next few months we will have good vaccine distribution and be able to start looking at the other side of this and not have more cases and more deaths in our community and serious long-term illness over the next few months.

295
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:01,850
So thank you, Marianne, again for

296
00:24:02,768 --> 00:24:05,010
for that summary is much appreciated.

297
00:24:05,050 --> 00:24:08,032
And I know that things are changing constantly.

298
00:24:08,092 --> 00:24:20,022
And I think it's just important as a council that we can do whatever we can to keep ourselves and the community updated on the latest ways that we are taking action to keep the community safe.

299
00:24:20,482 --> 00:24:21,163
Thanks, Marianne.

300
00:24:22,304 --> 00:24:23,264
I appreciate that.

301
00:24:23,445 --> 00:24:29,590
I think I just want to add to that that what I did include in this update, and I probably should have,

302
00:24:31,193 --> 00:24:39,879
Thank you for thanking me, but I have a staff that has worked seven days a week for 10 months, every day, long hours.

303
00:24:40,639 --> 00:24:47,544
And I think they really need a huge thank you as well and recognition for all the work they have done.

304
00:24:47,604 --> 00:24:52,687
They've done amazing work, created this amazing volunteer pool.

305
00:24:53,407 --> 00:24:55,749
We just launched a resource line.

306
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,442
We've done food distribution, mass distribution.

307
00:24:59,462 --> 00:25:15,150
I mean, they have stepped up and I think the Board of Health staff has not complained, does not receive one ounce of compensation for any of the additional work they have done for 10 months, seven days a week, 12 to 14, 16 hours a day.

308
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:18,092
So I do not want to take all the credit.

309
00:25:18,112 --> 00:25:21,674
I want my staff to be recognized as well.

310
00:25:22,207 --> 00:25:30,969
It's heard loud and clear, and I thank everyone, volunteers, staff, everyone who's been putting in overtime for a year to keep Medford safe.

311
00:25:31,049 --> 00:25:32,049
Thank you to everyone.

312
00:25:33,649 --> 00:25:34,489
Thank you, Councilor Pierce.

313
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:35,430
Councilor Scarpelli.

314
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:36,470
Thank you.

315
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:40,991
Mr. O'Connor, quick question.

316
00:25:41,011 --> 00:25:50,733
With the change in the state regulations, when I know it used to be red and green and yellow, now it's the way they

317
00:25:52,773 --> 00:25:55,234
they explain it, it's a little different.

318
00:25:56,675 --> 00:26:05,158
It seems like neighbor communities like Melrose and Malden, you see them whenever the governor updates it, but Method's not in that high category.

319
00:26:05,659 --> 00:26:07,039
Can you shed some light on that?

320
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:17,584
Yeah, I mean, I think as of last week, over 50% of the state was red, and we're still yellow, but our caseload is extremely high.

321
00:26:20,505 --> 00:26:23,967
mainly has been because of Tufts testing.

322
00:26:24,227 --> 00:26:29,950
They have done such a tremendous amount of work and they've been great.

323
00:26:30,050 --> 00:26:38,115
And they're probably a model for most higher education institutions to look at, but, and they are part of the Medford community.

324
00:26:38,175 --> 00:26:41,397
So the state includes their testing in our numbers.

325
00:26:42,137 --> 00:26:48,621
So you, you see them, you know, you see that Medford has an exorbitant number of testing along with other

326
00:26:49,615 --> 00:26:56,199
cities and towns that have institutions of higher education in them as well, who are doing testing and the state includes them.

327
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:03,064
So it's really been, I think, that amount of testing that has kept our positivity rate low, lower.

328
00:27:06,246 --> 00:27:07,086
It will change.

329
00:27:07,347 --> 00:27:15,832
And probably in this week's report, we will see that because the testing has diminished at Tufts because the kids aren't there now.

330
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,453
They've gone home for break.

331
00:27:18,127 --> 00:27:21,790
So their testing has diminished significantly over the last week or two.

332
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:34,298
So this week, I think you'll see what the state has done is they've combined not just the number of cases, but it's also an end all with the positivity rate.

333
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:36,399
So the 4% positivity rate.

334
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:45,332
It's odd because Somerville is one of the neighboring communities, and they're on that list, so we're doing something right.

335
00:27:49,053 --> 00:27:59,955
The other question I have is when we open up our businesses, restaurants, doctor's appointments, gyms, do we have contact tracing?

336
00:27:59,975 --> 00:28:07,397
Because I know that when we do the contact tracing, don't we have the restaurants or the gyms taking

337
00:28:08,857 --> 00:28:12,719
you know, the information of all the people that attend and their employees.

338
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,320
Don't they all have to check in?

339
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:20,064
And so there's an ongoing contact tracing list that goes on at those establishments?

340
00:28:21,865 --> 00:28:23,105
Yes, they're supposed to.

341
00:28:24,206 --> 00:28:26,507
And most have, and most do very well with it.

342
00:28:26,967 --> 00:28:28,348
A little different with restaurants.

343
00:28:28,368 --> 00:28:29,729
When you walk into a restaurant,

344
00:28:30,312 --> 00:28:35,714
They only have to give one party's name, like a contact for one party.

345
00:28:35,734 --> 00:28:39,256
So it could be a party two, could be a party of six, could be a party of five.

346
00:28:40,036 --> 00:28:41,377
And you're only getting one name.

347
00:28:41,797 --> 00:28:44,438
You don't know who the other four or five or six people were.

348
00:28:45,158 --> 00:28:52,101
At that point, before the last update, they could have eight people in a party.

349
00:28:53,802 --> 00:28:55,563
We're down to six now, and now we're at 25%.

350
00:28:55,943 --> 00:28:56,223
But yeah.

351
00:28:56,243 --> 00:28:56,423
All right.

352
00:28:58,728 --> 00:29:05,513
It's a little bit different with like a doctor's office or a hairdresser even, you know, they have appointments.

353
00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:11,857
So you know exactly who the hairdresser had the appointment with, you know exactly who the doctor's office had the appointment with.

354
00:29:13,498 --> 00:29:16,240
So there's a little bit of a difference there.

355
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:20,502
So the contact tracing is a lot easier in places that have appointments like that.

356
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:25,766
The other places like restaurants, it becomes a little bit more difficult.

357
00:29:26,572 --> 00:29:41,675
All right, but, you know, and I bring this up because there were some incidents over the past few weeks with a few restaurants and that the information went out citywide and really put

358
00:29:42,075 --> 00:29:46,937
these establishments in a bad light in a sense where, you know, people lost confidence.

359
00:29:47,458 --> 00:30:03,725
So could there be something as we move forward so we don't really damage any other reputations for other businesses that we mandate as a city that they do a total check-in where we're responding to those people that were there?

360
00:30:04,626 --> 00:30:10,489
And because, again, sometimes, you know, the instant, you know, the word that went out

361
00:30:12,127 --> 00:30:16,230
was, I guess, important to get the word out so people can understand the situation's severity.

362
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:20,712
But at the same time, it was also damaging.

363
00:30:21,513 --> 00:30:29,657
And especially with what we're seeing in this climate with our small businesses, I'd hate to see more businesses going through this right now.

364
00:30:30,178 --> 00:30:37,382
If there's something we can implement as a city that can get the word out to the patrons of those places.

365
00:30:38,242 --> 00:30:52,332
And it's not, you know, put out there where people can make their own determinations or be the judge and jury of these small businesses and try to work together with them.

366
00:30:52,872 --> 00:30:54,013
Could that be something we can do?

367
00:30:56,015 --> 00:30:56,515
Absolutely.

368
00:30:56,535 --> 00:30:58,336
If we can get cooperation, that'd be amazing.

369
00:30:58,376 --> 00:31:03,680
But that would mean we'd have to take the name and number of every single person who entered the establishment.

370
00:31:04,398 --> 00:31:06,680
which is different from what's required of them right now.

371
00:31:07,481 --> 00:31:14,326
But if we wanted to require that of them, we could certainly do that and would certainly make our lives a lot easier as well.

372
00:31:14,566 --> 00:31:19,750
So, you know, that's, but you know, other establishments are not following the guidelines at all.

373
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:26,896
So, you know, it's, it's, it depends on how cooperative we can really get the businesses to be.

374
00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:29,341
Yeah, no, but that'd be great.

375
00:31:29,361 --> 00:31:39,708
I think that should be something we should take initiative on and look at before we, as this is growing, we're seeing these spikes.

376
00:31:42,871 --> 00:31:51,916
If the state's going to mandate these regulations to small businesses like that, then I think that we have to do everything we can to support them and be partners.

377
00:31:51,996 --> 00:31:57,639
And if they're not doing what they're supposed to do, then they follow those consequences, but I appreciate that.

378
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:05,704
The last thing, I know that as we move forward, and we're hoping we're seeing the light at the end of the tunnel, I know we talked months ago about

379
00:32:06,664 --> 00:32:08,645
opening up the chambers and what we need to do.

380
00:32:08,705 --> 00:32:13,686
And I know you said that you needed a plan for the council.

381
00:32:13,726 --> 00:32:25,709
And I asked for assistance from your department to send me some bullet points where you would like to see added into those guidelines as we move forward.

382
00:32:27,850 --> 00:32:31,513
I haven't gotten those bullet points for assistance with our health department.

383
00:32:32,053 --> 00:32:38,357
And I know that I talked to the city solicitor, the acting city solicitor about questions that we had about capacity.

384
00:32:38,778 --> 00:32:45,302
Now obviously, we're erring on caution with the numbers increasing.

385
00:32:49,505 --> 00:32:52,086
The budget season is going to come pretty quick.

386
00:32:52,446 --> 00:32:55,648
And we know what happened last budget season with all the confusion.

387
00:32:56,228 --> 00:33:02,731
And I'd like to have something in place, because April, May, it's happening.

388
00:33:02,791 --> 00:33:11,274
But as we're seeing the vaccinations coming through, and I want to make sure that we have a plan that we're hitting the ground running.

389
00:33:12,135 --> 00:33:13,935
So if you could really assist me with that,

390
00:33:15,276 --> 00:33:17,778
I'll be the counselor on the point with that, Ms.

391
00:33:17,818 --> 00:33:19,119
O'Connor, to let that happen.

392
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:22,862
But I really need the guidance from the health department to assist me with that.

393
00:33:23,223 --> 00:33:24,143
So I'd appreciate that.

394
00:33:24,964 --> 00:33:25,524
Absolutely.

395
00:33:25,645 --> 00:33:26,345
And you know what?

396
00:33:26,445 --> 00:33:33,891
I hope to God by April or May, we have the vaccine out there and we're doing much better.

397
00:33:34,832 --> 00:33:43,219
But honestly, the guidance right now, you can just have to do the social distancing and have to do the mask wearing.

398
00:33:43,693 --> 00:33:49,878
So you can fit as many people in there as you can, as long as it's six feet social distancing and everyone's wearing masks.

399
00:33:50,378 --> 00:33:52,200
The rest of it is open meeting law.

400
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:57,104
That's not my expertise, but that's the only guidance right now for municipal meetings.

401
00:33:58,084 --> 00:34:07,892
You need to follow the social distancing regs as far as only allowing the maximum number of people in there that can fit with six feet social distancing.

402
00:34:07,932 --> 00:34:08,513
So that was it?

403
00:34:09,692 --> 00:34:11,012
Where were you a couple of months ago?

404
00:34:11,753 --> 00:34:14,773
You definitely weren't the same person I talked to.

405
00:34:14,973 --> 00:34:17,094
You weren't the same person I talked to a few months ago.

406
00:34:17,494 --> 00:34:17,974
But thank you.

407
00:34:18,014 --> 00:34:19,415
That's pretty easy.

408
00:34:19,595 --> 00:34:20,795
That's pretty easy.

409
00:34:21,135 --> 00:34:21,775
That's pretty easy.

410
00:34:21,835 --> 00:34:22,695
Six feet now.

411
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:25,416
Okay, thank you.

412
00:34:26,296 --> 00:34:28,937
We have a number of councilors that have questions.

413
00:34:28,977 --> 00:34:29,857
Councilor Morrell.

414
00:34:30,338 --> 00:34:31,478
Thank you, Councilor Scarbelli.

415
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:34,059
Thank you, Mr. President.

416
00:34:34,319 --> 00:34:39,280
Mary Ann, thank you so much for being here and for this update and many thanks to the Health Department and the Board of Health for

417
00:34:40,157 --> 00:34:42,358
all they've done for these past 10 months.

418
00:34:43,058 --> 00:34:48,800
So I saw in the report that Tufts has completed it's a butter testing as students have gone home.

419
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:52,242
Is that a program that we expect to resume in the spring?

420
00:34:53,122 --> 00:34:54,042
That's a good question.

421
00:34:54,142 --> 00:34:55,343
I know it ended this week.

422
00:34:55,843 --> 00:35:08,288
There hasn't been any discussion about it being reinstated in the spring, but that's something we can certainly pursue with them because I know it has been helpful and I know it's, you know,

423
00:35:10,101 --> 00:35:12,283
for most of my people took advantage of it, which was good.

424
00:35:13,083 --> 00:35:13,844
Okay, thank you.

425
00:35:14,124 --> 00:35:22,530
And just to make sure I understand your earlier point about the amount of tests Tufts doing is kind of contributing to a lower positivity rate.

426
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:37,180
Essentially you're saying if we see maybe that positivity rate tick up in the next few weeks, it's at least partially reflective of not having that large amount of Tufts tests to keep that number down, correct?

427
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:38,661
Correct.

428
00:35:39,275 --> 00:35:39,595
Thank you.

429
00:35:39,675 --> 00:35:40,336
Those are my questions.

430
00:35:41,977 --> 00:35:43,198
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

431
00:35:43,639 --> 00:35:44,739
Vice President Caviello.

432
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:46,781
Thank you, Mr. President.

433
00:35:46,801 --> 00:35:48,022
Thank you, Maria, for being here today.

434
00:35:48,302 --> 00:35:55,168
Maria, how many citations or warnings have you issued to businesses in the area?

435
00:35:57,050 --> 00:35:58,070
We've issued warnings.

436
00:35:58,871 --> 00:36:01,693
We have not issued actual citations to businesses.

437
00:36:01,713 --> 00:36:02,394
Just one warning?

438
00:36:03,435 --> 00:36:05,416
No, we've issued several warnings.

439
00:36:05,737 --> 00:36:07,098
I don't know that off the top of my head.

440
00:36:07,138 --> 00:36:07,538
I'm sorry.

441
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:22,269
There are some establishments that we get frequent complaints from, and there are some, you know, most, again, our goal is to educate and to support, because this is a difficult time for them, and we know that.

442
00:36:23,409 --> 00:36:24,970
So we're not out there to find people.

443
00:36:25,811 --> 00:36:34,296
It's just when we've been there one, two, three, four times, and it's still not getting the compliance, then we will issue a warning.

444
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:38,439
And where are we with our three nursing homes as of today?

445
00:36:39,985 --> 00:36:45,690
So vaccine is on the way as far as I know to them, which is great.

446
00:36:46,770 --> 00:36:48,712
They have been continually testing.

447
00:36:50,633 --> 00:37:09,648
There have been a few staff people recently who have tested positive, but as great, and we did have a small cluster, two clusters actually happening at one facility, which seems to have been resolved.

448
00:37:10,021 --> 00:37:13,645
with no deaths or anything, thank God.

449
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:19,592
But as far as the other facilities go, their patient testing has been great.

450
00:37:20,152 --> 00:37:20,913
Nothing so far.

451
00:37:20,973 --> 00:37:25,518
It's been mostly staff, which is from the community spread, obviously.

452
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:30,844
But they are continually testing and vaccine is on its way.

453
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:42,509
I did receive a note from Glenbridge where my dad is, and I guess a couple of patients had gone in there and they were transferred to another facility that could handle COVID patients.

454
00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:52,594
Yes, and I know our Medford Rehab facility has a COVID wing, and they have been accepting COVID patients.

455
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:54,435
I'm sorry, I didn't hear what you said.

456
00:37:54,455 --> 00:37:59,998
Medford Rehab and Nursing Center has a COVID wing.

457
00:38:01,355 --> 00:38:03,236
And they do accept COVID patients.

458
00:38:04,077 --> 00:38:15,945
And we have had a couple of deaths there within the last month, but those were patients who were transferred there already with COVID for basically for palliative care, I believe.

459
00:38:15,965 --> 00:38:21,348
And what role will the city be taking in the vaccination process?

460
00:38:22,709 --> 00:38:24,570
So that's happening really quickly.

461
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:27,712
We're finding out day by day, things are changing of course.

462
00:38:27,993 --> 00:38:28,073
And

463
00:38:29,226 --> 00:38:33,487
We recently found out that we are going to be involved in the first responder testing.

464
00:38:34,027 --> 00:38:41,730
We are hoping to be able to vaccinate all our EMS fire and police by the second week in January, is what we've been told.

465
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:50,032
We're expecting the first shipment of vaccine in and around January 4th, frozen, which then has to thaw.

466
00:38:50,717 --> 00:39:05,006
So we're hoping by the second week, we will be setting up, we're going to be partnering regionally to do this because the state doesn't want a lot of, you know, 351 cities and towns doing 351 clinics for their police and fire.

467
00:39:05,086 --> 00:39:08,068
So they're asking us to partner up so that you have a minimum of 200.

468
00:39:09,509 --> 00:39:17,053
So we will be partnering with Mystic Valley Public Health Coalition, which includes Malden, Melrose, Wakefield, Stoneham, and Medford.

469
00:39:17,113 --> 00:39:20,015
And I believe Winchester will be joining us as well.

470
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:34,424
Our hope is to set up four or five days of consecutive clinics within each community, so that all first responders, if they can't make the Medford one, they can go to the Malden one, they can go to the Melrose one, depending on when they get off shift.

471
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:39,146
We want to make sure we schedule that appropriately too, in case there are side effects, we want it off shift.

472
00:39:40,246 --> 00:39:42,107
So there's a lot of details to be worked out.

473
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:47,909
We do expect to be involved in phase two, which we're hoping starts somewhere in February.

474
00:39:48,623 --> 00:39:51,064
Phase two includes 65 plus.

475
00:39:51,304 --> 00:39:53,304
It includes people with comorbidities.

476
00:39:53,444 --> 00:39:55,625
It includes K-12 teachers.

477
00:39:56,545 --> 00:39:59,305
So we're expecting to be involved in those clinics as well.

478
00:40:00,086 --> 00:40:02,626
We are not involved in nursing home vaccinations.

479
00:40:02,786 --> 00:40:08,167
That's being handled by CVS and Walgreens, who the feds have contracted with.

480
00:40:09,087 --> 00:40:15,129
And we're not obviously involved in the hospitals and medical centers vaccinating their own staff.

481
00:40:16,433 --> 00:40:18,034
That's as far as we know at this point.

482
00:40:18,174 --> 00:40:22,697
But we've been practicing for this for about 10 years now.

483
00:40:22,737 --> 00:40:26,380
We've been doing EDS and pandemic planning for a long time.

484
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,822
And thank God we have.

485
00:40:29,922 --> 00:40:32,584
So we're ready to do this.

486
00:40:32,944 --> 00:40:37,267
And it's just a matter of when we get the vaccine, what we know we're supposed to do.

487
00:40:37,507 --> 00:40:39,289
And that's all rolling out by the state.

488
00:40:39,309 --> 00:40:40,750
It comes quickly.

489
00:40:41,663 --> 00:40:44,125
know, when it comes, but that's all we have right now.

490
00:40:45,126 --> 00:40:51,051
Right now, we know we're going to probably get the Moderna vaccine for the first responders, so that doesn't require the deep freeze.

491
00:40:52,352 --> 00:40:58,837
And again, to assure everybody, there is no live virus in any of these vaccines.

492
00:40:58,897 --> 00:41:02,099
They're an mRNA, which is a messenger RNA.

493
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,242
They work with a protein, so there is

494
00:41:05,795 --> 00:41:07,937
you do not get the virus.

495
00:41:07,957 --> 00:41:10,198
You cannot get the virus from this vaccine.

496
00:41:10,258 --> 00:41:13,301
There is no live virus in the Pfizer or the Moderna.

497
00:41:15,522 --> 00:41:21,627
So we really encourage people when this is available to please take, accept it.

498
00:41:21,767 --> 00:41:25,510
It's safe and we need it.

499
00:41:26,713 --> 00:41:34,235
And my last question is, I received a couple of calls from people who work in either a doctor's or a dentist's office.

500
00:41:34,735 --> 00:41:41,016
And they're asking why, when one of their employees in the office gets sick, the office isn't shut down.

501
00:41:42,696 --> 00:41:45,217
Do they have the same procedure?

502
00:41:46,257 --> 00:41:47,657
Sure, yeah.

503
00:41:47,777 --> 00:41:49,578
And we speak with them.

504
00:41:50,618 --> 00:41:56,179
They are all supposed to be in full PPE, personal protective equipment, at this point.

505
00:41:56,718 --> 00:41:57,458
when they're working.

506
00:41:58,618 --> 00:42:07,961
So they wouldn't even be considered close contacts because they're PPE, personal protective equipment.

507
00:42:08,201 --> 00:42:10,581
So, and that's, that's medical grade.

508
00:42:10,621 --> 00:42:13,122
That's not your surgical masks that you're wearing now.

509
00:42:13,842 --> 00:42:17,283
It's N95s, face shields, gowns, gloves, booties.

510
00:42:17,883 --> 00:42:25,005
So they are not considered close contacts when you're wearing, just like our police and fire.

511
00:42:25,398 --> 00:42:28,461
If they were in full PPE, they're not considered close contacts.

512
00:42:29,141 --> 00:42:29,702
Thank you, Marianne.

513
00:42:30,823 --> 00:42:32,204
Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

514
00:42:32,244 --> 00:42:32,964
Councilor Marks.

515
00:42:33,905 --> 00:42:34,646
Thank you, Mr. President.

516
00:42:34,666 --> 00:42:36,167
I want to thank Marianne and her staff.

517
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:39,080
It has been a trying time.

518
00:42:39,961 --> 00:43:00,487
And I want to thank, Mr. President, the residents of this community who have been dealing with this for 10 months and have, I think, done a tremendous job, Mr. President, in social distancing and watching out for their neighbors, watching out for people with comorbidities, and trying to do the best they can for their families and themselves in this trying time.

519
00:43:01,447 --> 00:43:03,968
So I think they deserve a round of applause as well.

520
00:43:05,668 --> 00:43:09,751
Marianne, any idea how many vaccines we're going to get in this community?

521
00:43:09,771 --> 00:43:13,534
Yeah, not specificity yet.

522
00:43:14,194 --> 00:43:18,017
Again, it's coming out in phases.

523
00:43:19,218 --> 00:43:23,822
So we're in phase one now with the first responders.

524
00:43:23,942 --> 00:43:31,127
So phase 1A, our medical personnel and hospital folks, and that's COVID facing only.

525
00:43:31,147 --> 00:43:32,808
Phase 1B.

526
00:43:34,203 --> 00:43:36,824
So you're actually dealing with a COVID patient.

527
00:43:37,544 --> 00:43:39,044
So that's not your dentist's office.

528
00:43:39,124 --> 00:43:40,445
It's not your doctor's office.

529
00:43:40,525 --> 00:43:50,207
It's your people who are actually in the ERs, in the ICUs, in the hospitals that are dealing with COVID patients that are getting these tests, these vaccines now.

530
00:43:51,387 --> 00:43:56,969
Eventually by the time we finish phase one, the rest of the medical community should be included.

531
00:43:58,949 --> 00:44:01,310
Phase two is much broader population.

532
00:44:03,208 --> 00:44:09,489
which then I think we will be involved in, which, like I said, includes your schools and stuff.

533
00:44:09,749 --> 00:44:18,311
The general, real general population, like young adults and such, we're probably not looking at that till maybe April.

534
00:44:19,211 --> 00:44:31,313
So, Marianne, when you say phase one, is the city of Method involved with the distribution of vaccinations in phase one for police, fire, and first line responders?

535
00:44:32,005 --> 00:44:33,347
Oh, yes, we are.

536
00:44:33,587 --> 00:44:38,773
The Board of Health will be doing those vaccinations, like I said, with Malden, Melrose, Wakefield.

537
00:44:39,714 --> 00:44:45,902
We will be doing a regional vaccination clinics for our first responders for the region.

538
00:44:46,843 --> 00:44:47,544
Right.

539
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:51,388
So every first responder in the city of Method will be guaranteed

540
00:44:52,193 --> 00:44:56,616
that the city of Medford will have their vaccine?

541
00:44:56,896 --> 00:45:05,301
Or when you say regional, I kind of get lost because I'm not sure who's the direct responsibility when it comes to regional.

542
00:45:06,321 --> 00:45:11,024
So we had to have a minimum of 200 first responders to be able to hold the clinic.

543
00:45:11,704 --> 00:45:19,689
And we don't have that as far as first responders right now anyways, who have been surveyed to want to receive the vaccine.

544
00:45:19,709 --> 00:45:21,010
We didn't hit the 200 mark.

545
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:33,567
So we had to partner up with local other communities to come up with that 200 number, but we will get the vaccine we need for our Medfit folks.

546
00:45:34,247 --> 00:45:36,148
It will be offered in Medfit.

547
00:45:36,649 --> 00:45:42,333
However, if that's not a date that's convenient for them, they can go to our regional partner.

548
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:49,938
So Mary Ann, what is the total number of our police and fire personnel?

549
00:45:51,932 --> 00:46:04,136
As far as those who are willing to take the vaccine right now, what I've been told by both police and fire, we're looking at probably about 130.

550
00:46:05,097 --> 00:46:07,298
Okay, so now we're talking two different things.

551
00:46:08,798 --> 00:46:13,500
Willing to take and the number of first line responders that we have.

552
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:19,702
Because we have over 200 in my last count during budgeting of police and fire.

553
00:46:21,117 --> 00:46:23,279
If we're going to count- Is this mandatory?

554
00:46:23,559 --> 00:46:27,282
We can't because of the emergency FDA approval?

555
00:46:27,362 --> 00:46:32,786
I understand that, but- If I have 200 firefighters and police officers that want to take it, I'll get it.

556
00:46:33,667 --> 00:46:36,329
But right now I've been told I only have 140.

557
00:46:36,949 --> 00:46:39,752
I will get as much vaccine as I need if I have the numbers.

558
00:46:39,792 --> 00:46:39,972
Right.

559
00:46:40,292 --> 00:46:47,578
So why wouldn't we go to whoever is distributing this and say, we need 200 vaccines for our police and fire?

560
00:46:48,453 --> 00:46:54,496
Because they asked us to ask how many would be interested in surveying to take it, and we got the numbers, and that's what we were told.

561
00:46:56,037 --> 00:47:03,221
And if that number changes, if I said, no, I don't want to do it, then I decide to do it, is it a quick turnaround to get the vaccine?

562
00:47:03,901 --> 00:47:05,722
Yeah, we'll obviously have overage.

563
00:47:05,762 --> 00:47:06,403
We can use.

564
00:47:08,884 --> 00:47:11,085
OK, that makes zero sense to me.

565
00:47:11,125 --> 00:47:16,266
If we have the 200 requirement, that we wouldn't just get 200 vaccines.

566
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:21,028
They're not going to give me extra if I'm not going to use it, because it has to go to somebody else who will take it.

567
00:47:21,828 --> 00:47:23,028
Right, I understand that.

568
00:47:23,068 --> 00:47:27,270
But then when you start looking at first line responders, there's EMS.

569
00:47:28,110 --> 00:47:32,611
You have, in my opinion, phase 2 with seniors.

570
00:47:33,772 --> 00:47:35,512
Any idea when phase 2 is going to happen?

571
00:47:36,273 --> 00:47:36,753
February.

572
00:47:37,568 --> 00:47:38,128
In February?

573
00:47:38,749 --> 00:47:39,749
That's what we're being told.

574
00:47:41,110 --> 00:47:43,311
Do we know mid-February, late February?

575
00:47:44,552 --> 00:47:47,734
We've been told February to March.

576
00:47:48,194 --> 00:47:48,875
February to March.

577
00:47:49,815 --> 00:47:51,516
So it's another two months before.

578
00:47:52,417 --> 00:47:58,500
If you go on the state website, the mass.gov website, that's a great kind of a grid there.

579
00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:03,503
And you can see who the different folks are, what the different populations are, and what the timeline is.

580
00:48:03,943 --> 00:48:04,844
It's all spelled out.

581
00:48:05,362 --> 00:48:08,383
on the mass.gov website for people who want more information.

582
00:48:08,803 --> 00:48:09,043
Sure.

583
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:17,245
So, seniors that currently get the flu vaccination by the city, is it going to be the same process and setup?

584
00:48:18,125 --> 00:48:18,625
I hope so.

585
00:48:19,705 --> 00:48:20,685
That's what we're working for.

586
00:48:21,266 --> 00:48:25,006
It's a little bit different now because of the social distancing requirements.

587
00:48:25,647 --> 00:48:32,168
We're going to have to really do an appointment basis, you know, thing and do it very carefully.

588
00:48:32,908 --> 00:48:39,934
So the state is actually setting up a new database that we're all trying to learn really quickly that allows us to do that.

589
00:48:41,516 --> 00:48:44,518
But yeah, that's the plan.

590
00:48:46,220 --> 00:48:47,421
Right.

591
00:48:47,821 --> 00:48:49,723
And how do we know the numbers?

592
00:48:50,944 --> 00:48:54,287
Naturally, you're not going to be able to check with every senior that may want the vaccine.

593
00:48:54,767 --> 00:49:00,412
So how will you order the vaccines for our phase two senior population?

594
00:49:01,377 --> 00:49:11,487
So I know it's a little bit different with seniors because they don't all have internet access and all those details haven't been worked out, but with this new database that the state's putting out, it's actually going to be out there.

595
00:49:11,687 --> 00:49:17,473
It's going to be a COVID ready application, I believe, that UI,

596
00:49:19,044 --> 00:49:23,065
Anybody can get on and say, yes, I want the vaccine.

597
00:49:23,165 --> 00:49:24,665
I'll take it whenever I can get it.

598
00:49:24,685 --> 00:49:28,426
I don't have any of these underlying conditions.

599
00:49:28,786 --> 00:49:30,387
I work here.

600
00:49:30,487 --> 00:49:31,507
I qualify for this.

601
00:49:32,027 --> 00:49:36,388
Because in that second phase as well, essential employees are included.

602
00:49:36,508 --> 00:49:39,529
So you sign up and you say, yes, I work at a grocery store.

603
00:49:39,589 --> 00:49:41,049
Yes, I work at the DPW.

604
00:49:41,229 --> 00:49:42,729
Yes, you know.

605
00:49:43,709 --> 00:49:45,730
And all of that will be fed to us.

606
00:49:46,493 --> 00:49:54,076
And then when we get the vaccine, we're able to actually call that information out and be able to understand what the numbers are going to look like.

607
00:49:55,457 --> 00:50:05,381
I'm not sure what the rest of the promotion and push out is going to be for folks right now for the state, but I'm sure we will get as much vaccine as we need when we need it.

608
00:50:06,341 --> 00:50:11,824
And as far as you know, and I appreciate you answering all these questions, I realize this is a moving target.

609
00:50:14,084 --> 00:50:21,867
So as far as you know, in order to obtain a vaccination, you have to go on the state website, expression right now.

610
00:50:22,068 --> 00:50:22,448
I don't know.

611
00:50:22,568 --> 00:50:24,389
I mean, I just learned about this this morning.

612
00:50:24,409 --> 00:50:26,469
I'm just trying to figure it out.

613
00:50:26,750 --> 00:50:33,933
Cause I'm getting, I'm fielding a lot of questions from seniors asking when the city will get everybody wants to know.

614
00:50:33,993 --> 00:50:39,195
And I understand that, but there aren't a lot of, there aren't a lot of really good answers right now.

615
00:50:39,595 --> 00:50:43,557
The best answers are on the mass.gov website around the vaccines.

616
00:50:44,108 --> 00:50:45,829
That's as much information as I have.

617
00:50:46,129 --> 00:50:49,431
I don't have any more information than anyone else at this point, unfortunately.

618
00:50:49,932 --> 00:50:54,694
The first responder thing came up last week and we were told to have it ready in two weeks.

619
00:50:54,734 --> 00:51:06,121
So, you know, it's happening quickly and we're all doing our best and we'll figure it out and people will get notified, but we're looking at a long process.

620
00:51:06,141 --> 00:51:11,945
We're looking at between now and March, April, between maybe May, you know,

621
00:51:12,415 --> 00:51:16,038
before everybody and anybody gets in line.

622
00:51:16,158 --> 00:51:22,804
But that phased kind of approach is all outlined on mass.gov, who's included and what phase.

623
00:51:23,144 --> 00:51:23,364
Right.

624
00:51:23,884 --> 00:51:32,732
I guess if you're in Congress, you overstep all these phases, and you can get your shot right away, because we know how essential people in Congress are.

625
00:51:33,252 --> 00:51:34,994
And they can get their shot immediately.

626
00:51:35,114 --> 00:51:36,855
What are health people on in phase one?

627
00:51:38,469 --> 00:51:38,829
What's that?

628
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:41,111
What health people are not in phase one?

629
00:51:41,191 --> 00:51:42,072
They're not in phase one.

630
00:51:42,152 --> 00:51:46,395
Okay, well, maybe you have to run for Congress to get your shot.

631
00:51:47,736 --> 00:51:56,842
So, and I realize, you know, you don't have all the answers now, but I really am curious how this is going to roll out in the community.

632
00:51:57,462 --> 00:52:05,705
And we're partnering with the state, and right there, I don't have a lot of confidence in how the state operates, to be quite frank.

633
00:52:06,205 --> 00:52:13,347
So that worries me a little bit, the fact that the only option may be at this particular point.

634
00:52:13,927 --> 00:52:33,318
to have someone go on the internet and pull out an application, and knowing that there's a fair number of people that don't have internet access, a fair number of people that may not have the whereabouts to do that, and I'm wondering what process we're going to set up, and this may be too early for you now, but I'm sure these discussions should be had right now.

635
00:52:34,099 --> 00:52:36,160
Yeah, we're in those discussions, and we will.

636
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:37,901
We will come up with support mechanisms.

637
00:52:37,921 --> 00:52:39,262
Like I said, we have the whole

638
00:52:39,722 --> 00:52:44,626
resource line set up right now, which is an amazing multi-language resource line.

639
00:52:45,067 --> 00:52:51,872
And I am sure we will be using that for people to call, um, and, and tell us they want vaccine and ask us how to send.

640
00:52:51,912 --> 00:52:52,693
We will assist.

641
00:52:52,753 --> 00:52:54,154
We've been doing this for 10 months.

642
00:52:54,194 --> 00:52:56,336
We've assisted everyone we could possibly assist.

643
00:52:56,376 --> 00:53:00,580
And we will be there for them going forward through this vaccination program.

644
00:53:01,180 --> 00:53:03,122
Um, we will set up systems.

645
00:53:03,182 --> 00:53:06,605
You trust me, everyone's going to get their vaccine when they can.

646
00:53:06,865 --> 00:53:06,985
And

647
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:10,654
I, you know, like I said, it's, it's fast moving.

648
00:53:10,714 --> 00:53:14,704
And unfortunately, yes, we are partnering with the state who has to partner with the feds who, you know.

649
00:53:16,585 --> 00:53:17,585
I understand that.

650
00:53:17,605 --> 00:53:29,411
I just want to make sure that when the time comes that we're not sitting here saying, well, I wish we had enough vaccinations because we didn't realize that this many people wanted the vaccination.

651
00:53:29,991 --> 00:53:34,273
And I just want to make sure that's well thought out before we enter that phase.

652
00:53:34,713 --> 00:53:37,955
And I want to make sure we hit all segments of our population.

653
00:53:38,335 --> 00:53:39,536
So not just the elite,

654
00:53:40,296 --> 00:53:50,902
that are up in Congress or have the, where the means to get their vaccination before anyone else, before anyone else, you know, get their fair share as well.

655
00:53:51,422 --> 00:54:01,748
So, and I promise we will, we will use robocalls, we'll use mailings, we'll use everything at our disposal that we've used in the past to get the word out and sign people up.

656
00:54:02,369 --> 00:54:06,331
And, and they are promising us though, you know,

657
00:54:07,861 --> 00:54:11,322
They are promising us enough vaccine for all.

658
00:54:11,642 --> 00:54:14,444
But again, it's going to be a phased approach.

659
00:54:14,524 --> 00:54:18,645
Not everyone's going to qualify for the first phase or the second phase.

660
00:54:18,685 --> 00:54:27,869
So they're doing it by comorbidities, elders, essential workers.

661
00:54:28,755 --> 00:54:33,478
By the time it trickles down to the younger population, we're looking at probably the end of the spring.

662
00:54:34,559 --> 00:54:35,800
And I don't doubt that process.

663
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:45,407
And my last question is, what percent of the testing that currently happens in Method consists of Tufts testing?

664
00:54:49,170 --> 00:54:51,451
Close to half, I would say.

665
00:54:53,193 --> 00:54:54,794
So they reported the 23,000 tests last

666
00:54:57,243 --> 00:55:02,246
week in the state's report that Medford conducted, and probably 10,000 of those were Tufts.

667
00:55:02,446 --> 00:55:03,746
Were Tufts.

668
00:55:03,906 --> 00:55:12,911
So I don't want to speak out of turn, but it's clear to say if the Tufts testing dwindles, that Medford's going to find itself in the red pretty quickly.

669
00:55:12,931 --> 00:55:14,332
I would think so.

670
00:55:15,412 --> 00:55:16,193
You said you think so?

671
00:55:16,773 --> 00:55:17,814
Yeah, I would think so.

672
00:55:17,874 --> 00:55:18,654
Yeah, I believe so.

673
00:55:19,034 --> 00:55:19,214
Right.

674
00:55:19,695 --> 00:55:20,455
I would think so, too.

675
00:55:21,275 --> 00:55:23,076
And we all know, yeah.

676
00:55:24,077 --> 00:55:24,217
Right.

677
00:55:25,014 --> 00:55:35,919
And I don't think that should alarm anyone, but I think it's important to know because as Councilor Scott Pelley mentioned, you know, we went from being the yellow to the red back to the yellow.

678
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:40,182
Now we've been in the yellow for quite some time or the green or whatever color we've been in.

679
00:55:40,942 --> 00:55:44,504
We haven't reached that red point and it's

680
00:55:45,124 --> 00:55:49,545
merely because of the testing, as Councilor Morrell mentioned too, for Tufts.

681
00:55:50,325 --> 00:55:59,347
And that's going to be very interesting to see what those numbers will be like once that, once that testing goes down, but I appreciate your time.

682
00:55:59,387 --> 00:55:59,747
Thank you.

683
00:56:00,588 --> 00:56:00,848
Thank you.

684
00:56:00,888 --> 00:56:05,209
Councilor Marks, Vice President Caviello.

685
00:56:05,349 --> 00:56:06,569
Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

686
00:56:07,289 --> 00:56:10,710
Marion, thank you very much to you for all your hard work and to your department.

687
00:56:10,750 --> 00:56:11,150
I know that,

688
00:56:12,259 --> 00:56:16,142
You've worked long days, long weeks, and many months on this.

689
00:56:16,342 --> 00:56:18,863
I just have a couple of quick questions.

690
00:56:20,004 --> 00:56:24,147
So if I'm correct, every morning, is your department notified of positive cases?

691
00:56:26,948 --> 00:56:28,609
They're notified 24 hours a day.

692
00:56:28,629 --> 00:56:34,313
Okay, and at that point, so if you're notified 24 hours a day, when does contact tracings begin?

693
00:56:34,333 --> 00:56:37,635
Well, with 862 cases, it's Thanksgiving.

694
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:42,979
It's been, it's been difficult.

695
00:56:43,059 --> 00:56:44,140
I'm not going to lie to you.

696
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:51,304
It's been difficult to keep up, but we've got, we've onboarded a lot of new staff, luckily.

697
00:56:51,685 --> 00:56:57,268
And unfortunately with the state, it takes time to get people onto the Maven system.

698
00:56:57,308 --> 00:57:01,931
We tried to train, it's taken us two weeks to get people on, which is not a good thing.

699
00:57:02,351 --> 00:57:06,314
So we've come up with a system to bypass that.

700
00:57:08,100 --> 00:57:16,104
But we also instituted a first call program because we realized that it was taking time for the contact tracing to happen.

701
00:57:17,044 --> 00:57:21,386
So we gathered a team just to let people know.

702
00:57:21,806 --> 00:57:27,409
So we get those cases in the morning, we open up the Maven database, and there's 20 cases.

703
00:57:28,009 --> 00:57:34,112
We're assigning those right out, right away, so people will get a call to say at least, you're positive, please isolate.

704
00:57:34,934 --> 00:57:40,855
think about who you've been in contact with and you will get a call from a contact tracer within a day or two.

705
00:57:42,215 --> 00:57:45,136
So think about who you've been with and be ready to give that information.

706
00:57:46,016 --> 00:57:52,897
But our immediate need was to get those people who were infectious off the streets and to let them know they were positive.

707
00:57:53,297 --> 00:58:02,259
Because what's happening is a lot of the providers and the testing sites who are doing these tests are not following up with these people and not letting them know that they're positive.

708
00:58:03,077 --> 00:58:04,218
And that's what we were finding.

709
00:58:04,318 --> 00:58:11,183
So we felt it was more important that we make a first call to make sure they knew they were positive and to isolate.

710
00:58:12,704 --> 00:58:13,684
We are catching up.

711
00:58:15,666 --> 00:58:18,688
Happily to say, as of today, we think we will be there.

712
00:58:19,869 --> 00:58:22,250
I'm not sure what's going to happen over the holidays.

713
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:26,333
COVID doesn't take a holiday, but, and I know there's no testing over the holiday,

714
00:58:27,182 --> 00:58:33,347
but, and it's going to be, and the state CDC folks are not working on Christmas day.

715
00:58:33,407 --> 00:58:43,015
So, you know, the next week is going to be a little bit challenging, but we are catching up with the 862 cases since Thanksgiving.

716
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:49,540
I apologize to everyone out there who has not received a call, but at least you should have gotten a first call.

717
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:53,223
And some people, now that we're calling back to the contact trace to say,

718
00:58:53,753 --> 00:58:54,614
I already got a call.

719
00:58:54,634 --> 00:58:57,256
I already gave this information out and that was the first call.

720
00:58:58,197 --> 00:59:01,599
We're now we're trying to actually get the data for the state database.

721
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:05,442
But the most important thing is that folks knew they were possibly isolated.

722
00:59:06,383 --> 00:59:08,385
And Marianne, how many people do we have making the calls?

723
00:59:09,606 --> 00:59:21,155
So as of now, we're up to, I believe we're up to five, six, and we have, we had three more go through training yesterday.

724
00:59:22,187 --> 00:59:24,268
And we have another three going through.

725
00:59:24,288 --> 00:59:25,768
It only happens on Mondays.

726
00:59:25,788 --> 00:59:28,049
The training only occurs on Mondays with the state.

727
00:59:28,689 --> 00:59:32,350
And then they have to take a test and then they have to wait for the answer.

728
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:36,472
So like I said, there's a delay in actually getting them on the system.

729
00:59:37,572 --> 00:59:41,954
But while they're not, while we're waiting for them to get on the system, now we're having to make those first calls.

730
00:59:43,534 --> 00:59:52,037
So we had six onboarded as of last week, an additional three yesterday, and I believe an additional two or three next Monday are getting trained as well.

731
00:59:52,634 --> 00:59:52,794
Good.

732
00:59:53,775 --> 00:59:53,995
Okay.

733
00:59:54,155 --> 00:59:54,495
Thank you.

734
00:59:54,535 --> 01:00:06,103
And one last question with, I've got a number of questions on this and I know I watched the school committee meetings and just kind of see what's going on on the school side.

735
01:00:06,123 --> 01:00:12,568
And I received questions from residents regarding the metrics that on the method, public schools website.

736
01:00:13,708 --> 01:00:18,892
You know, last time I checked, which was earlier today, it looked like they hadn't been updated since November 29th.

737
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:21,114
I mean, is there a reason why it's,

738
01:00:22,138 --> 01:00:23,579
taking so long to update those.

739
01:00:23,619 --> 01:00:27,441
I know, you know, a lot of parents, you know, want, you know, the latest and greatest data.

740
01:00:27,802 --> 01:00:35,426
And I know few, few of the schools have had issues with regards to, you know, COVID outbreaks between, you know, between staff and students.

741
01:00:35,466 --> 01:00:42,991
So, you know, I would think that the, I would think that the numbers should be more current than that, you know, November 29th.

742
01:00:43,111 --> 01:00:43,932
Are you aware of that?

743
01:00:44,875 --> 01:00:46,976
No, I thought that they were pretty good.

744
01:00:46,996 --> 01:00:56,961
I know they contact me, they put up that, so there is monthly data that goes up and that would be the November data that's there that they take actually from us for communities.

745
01:00:57,401 --> 01:01:02,784
But as far as the school-based data, I thought they were pretty up to date.

746
01:01:02,904 --> 01:01:08,827
And I honestly, I have not looked at the school website, but I know they contact us on a weekly basis and I know

747
01:01:10,185 --> 01:01:14,628
The school nursing department works really hard with them to make sure they have the most up-to-date data.

748
01:01:14,708 --> 01:01:17,190
So I'm not sure why it's November 20th.

749
01:01:17,210 --> 01:01:20,852
That doesn't make sense to me.

750
01:01:21,032 --> 01:01:23,494
How often do you think it should be updated?

751
01:01:23,514 --> 01:01:28,097
I mean, how often do you think parents should actually see, is it daily?

752
01:01:28,197 --> 01:01:28,998
Is it weekly?

753
01:01:29,098 --> 01:01:29,338
Is it?

754
01:01:30,018 --> 01:01:32,480
I think the goal right now is weekly for them.

755
01:01:33,821 --> 01:01:35,582
So we're doing testing twice a week.

756
01:01:36,523 --> 01:01:44,926
So like we did testing today at the schools, we'll get those cases tomorrow and work through those and those numbers will be collected.

757
01:01:45,026 --> 01:01:49,728
And then we do testing again on Friday and we do those cases on Saturday.

758
01:01:50,528 --> 01:01:58,491
So I believe on a weekly basis, they try to update it Thursday or Friday, but I could be wrong.

759
01:01:58,531 --> 01:02:00,732
I shouldn't speak for the schools because I'm really, I shouldn't.

760
01:02:02,125 --> 01:02:02,805
No, no, I understand.

761
01:02:02,845 --> 01:02:05,866
I just, I know I've seen you at some of the school committee meetings.

762
01:02:05,946 --> 01:02:09,387
I know you've been called upon to answer questions as well as Tony Vanto.

763
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:13,268
And I just wanted to, to me- I can bring that forward to them now.

764
01:02:13,328 --> 01:02:14,729
I'll bring that up to Tony.

765
01:02:15,309 --> 01:02:16,749
If you could, I'd greatly appreciate it.

766
01:02:16,769 --> 01:02:19,930
I know that I've received calls from parents regarding that.

767
01:02:21,311 --> 01:02:26,652
It's, you know, I mean, that data should be more current, I would think, than November 29th.

768
01:02:26,752 --> 01:02:28,633
And that's, I think, almost a month ago, so.

769
01:02:28,993 --> 01:02:32,215
Yeah, I'd be surprised if it's not, but okay, I will look at that.

770
01:02:33,255 --> 01:02:34,316
Okay.

771
01:02:34,816 --> 01:02:35,376
Let's see.

772
01:02:36,196 --> 01:02:37,277
Any of the questions from the council?

773
01:02:38,237 --> 01:02:40,078
Chief of staff Rodriguez has his hand up.

774
01:02:40,098 --> 01:02:40,258
Yep.

775
01:02:40,819 --> 01:02:41,219
I got him.

776
01:02:41,439 --> 01:02:43,000
I just want to get the council first.

777
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:44,120
Oh, sorry.

778
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:45,000
I do have a question.

779
01:02:45,461 --> 01:02:45,741
Okay.

780
01:02:45,761 --> 01:02:47,722
Councilor Morrell, and then we'll go to Dave Rodriguez.

781
01:02:47,742 --> 01:02:48,422
Councilor Morrell.

782
01:02:48,882 --> 01:02:49,743
Thank you, Mr. President.

783
01:02:50,383 --> 01:02:56,786
Just through the chair for Marion, is there anything, you know, outside of obviously our personal public health responsibilities that,

784
01:02:57,239 --> 01:03:05,180
residents can do to assist the Board of Health Department as far as are there contact tracing volunteers needed or anything like that?

785
01:03:06,101 --> 01:03:06,821
Yeah, sure.

786
01:03:06,901 --> 01:03:10,741
We have the IUK program that's doing a lot of calls.

787
01:03:10,801 --> 01:03:21,743
So when we have people in isolation and quarantine, we'd like to follow up on them to make sure they have access to, you know, food, diapers, supplies, if they're stuck in the house, you know, what they need.

788
01:03:21,803 --> 01:03:26,084
So we do have a whole, you know, volunteer system set up for that if people are interested.

789
01:03:27,003 --> 01:03:33,585
We do have this first call and some of those folks, a lot of those folks are volunteers helping us out with that.

790
01:03:34,025 --> 01:03:37,026
The food distribution program in general is volunteer.

791
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:38,706
So we have a lot of volunteer opportunities.

792
01:03:39,307 --> 01:03:51,510
And certainly with the vaccination clinics coming up, we are going to need a lot of assistance, even, you know, non-medical certainly, but non-medical as far as, you know, registration, crowd control,

793
01:03:52,279 --> 01:03:54,341
you know, information, that type of thing.

794
01:03:54,481 --> 01:04:01,045
So if people are interested in helping or registering medical or non-medical, certainly contact us.

795
01:04:01,106 --> 01:04:03,107
We'll take all the help that we can.

796
01:04:03,167 --> 01:04:06,850
Okay, so the best way is to reach out to the health department directly?

797
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:07,630
Yes, yes.

798
01:04:07,891 --> 01:04:13,275
Brooke Hoyt is actually our local volunteer MRC coordinator in my department.

799
01:04:13,875 --> 01:04:15,656
I'm sure she's on the website, Brooke Hoyt.

800
01:04:16,537 --> 01:04:20,620
And she would be the best person to contact if you're interested in volunteering.

801
01:04:22,002 --> 01:04:22,803
Okay, great, thank you.

802
01:04:24,204 --> 01:04:25,145
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

803
01:04:25,165 --> 01:04:27,908
Let's see, Dave Rodriguez, Chief of Staff.

804
01:04:28,588 --> 01:04:29,309
Thank you, Mr. President.

805
01:04:29,329 --> 01:04:34,914
Just as a point of clarification, the metrics on the school website were updated on 12-18.

806
01:04:34,934 --> 01:04:39,959
That's located right there, including building classroom readiness and some updated numbers there.

807
01:04:40,865 --> 01:04:41,045
Okay.

808
01:04:41,085 --> 01:04:47,192
So, but ideally, should it be, I mean, that's more current at least, but the last one I saw was 1129.

809
01:04:47,893 --> 01:04:49,835
I mean, is the goal weekly?

810
01:04:49,855 --> 01:04:50,736
I mean, should it be weekly?

811
01:04:50,776 --> 01:04:52,799
I would think, I mean- Every Friday, yeah.

812
01:04:53,199 --> 01:04:54,360
Yeah, it's updated every Friday.

813
01:04:54,461 --> 01:04:55,842
Okay, because I mean, that there is what?

814
01:04:55,862 --> 01:04:56,062
That's-

815
01:04:56,703 --> 01:04:57,724
What, almost three weeks?

816
01:04:58,824 --> 01:04:59,665
That's three weeks.

817
01:04:59,745 --> 01:05:01,206
I think we need to do better than that.

818
01:05:01,286 --> 01:05:04,708
I think the parents of our school system deserve better than that as well.

819
01:05:04,828 --> 01:05:09,230
So I know everybody's busy, but I think updating the metrics should be a priority.

820
01:05:09,250 --> 01:05:15,153
So people know if they're sending their students to school, sending their kids to school, they know what they're walking into.

821
01:05:15,353 --> 01:05:18,195
And that's something that we need to make sure everyone is aware of.

822
01:05:18,615 --> 01:05:21,297
So, thank you, Chief of Staff Rodriguez.

823
01:05:22,117 --> 01:05:23,258
Any other questions from the council?

824
01:05:26,390 --> 01:05:26,730
Second.

825
01:05:26,950 --> 01:05:32,472
On the motion of Vice President Caravaglia to receive and place on file, seconded by Councilor Behrs.

826
01:05:32,533 --> 01:05:34,053
Clerk Cunabes, please call the roll.

827
01:05:41,316 --> 01:05:41,856
Councilor Behrs.

828
01:05:41,976 --> 01:05:42,216
Yes.

829
01:05:42,717 --> 01:05:43,537
Vice President Caravaglia.

830
01:05:43,557 --> 01:05:43,797
Yes.

831
01:05:44,157 --> 01:05:44,657
Councilor Knight.

832
01:05:45,158 --> 01:05:45,418
Yes.

833
01:05:45,718 --> 01:05:46,278
Councilor Marks.

834
01:05:46,578 --> 01:05:46,938
Yes.

835
01:05:47,178 --> 01:05:47,819
Councilor Morrell.

836
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:48,599
Yes.

837
01:05:48,899 --> 01:05:49,699
Councilor Scarpelli.

838
01:05:49,739 --> 01:05:49,899
Yes.

839
01:05:50,160 --> 01:05:50,680
President Fevella.

840
01:05:52,058 --> 01:05:54,279
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

841
01:05:54,919 --> 01:05:55,840
The motion passes.

842
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:58,721
Mary Ann, thank you very much, and thank you to your department.

843
01:05:58,981 --> 01:05:59,402
Thank you.

844
01:05:59,642 --> 01:06:00,102
Thank you.

845
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:01,843
Have a good evening.

846
01:06:01,863 --> 01:06:02,563
Thank you.

847
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:08,186
We have 20-076 offered by Councilor Behrs, and that motion is similar to Councilor Scarpelli's 20-679.

848
01:06:08,326 --> 01:06:14,629
And I believe there's a motion to join those two resolutions.

849
01:06:14,649 --> 01:06:15,470
Motion to join.

850
01:06:16,190 --> 01:06:19,392
On the motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor

851
01:06:20,984 --> 01:06:23,305
to join resolutions 20676 and 20679.

852
01:06:24,846 --> 01:06:32,052
Clerk, please call the roll.

853
01:06:32,172 --> 01:06:33,072
Did we lose the connection?

854
01:06:36,575 --> 01:06:37,776
Clerk, please call the roll.

855
01:06:38,256 --> 01:06:38,857
Councilor Behrs.

856
01:06:39,577 --> 01:06:39,897
Yes.

857
01:06:40,238 --> 01:06:41,158
Vice President Carabiello.

858
01:06:41,319 --> 01:06:41,639
Yes.

859
01:06:41,979 --> 01:06:42,499
Councilor Knight.

860
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:43,280
Yes.

861
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:43,900
Councilor Marks.

862
01:06:44,021 --> 01:06:44,361
Yes.

863
01:06:44,581 --> 01:06:45,201
Councilor Morrell.

864
01:06:48,023 --> 01:06:48,684
She's frozen.

865
01:06:49,545 --> 01:06:49,965
Councilor Morrell.

866
01:06:50,317 --> 01:06:50,977
She's frozen.

867
01:06:52,778 --> 01:06:53,398
They're not on yet.

868
01:06:53,999 --> 01:06:55,019
She's hanging on.

869
01:06:55,499 --> 01:06:59,321
I'm telling you, this is sabotage.

870
01:06:59,341 --> 01:07:00,542
Someone doesn't want us to read these.

871
01:07:01,442 --> 01:07:02,463
Can you hear us now?

872
01:07:04,804 --> 01:07:05,784
It's sabotage.

873
01:07:14,704 --> 01:07:15,004
Okay.

874
01:07:15,145 --> 01:07:19,690
Councilor Morrell, we're in the middle of a roll call to join the two resolutions.

875
01:07:20,931 --> 01:07:22,653
And you're actually up in the roll call.

876
01:07:23,274 --> 01:07:23,494
Yes.

877
01:07:23,874 --> 01:07:24,195
Thank you.

878
01:07:25,377 --> 01:07:26,097
Councilor Scarpelli?

879
01:07:26,117 --> 01:07:26,478
Yes.

880
01:07:26,618 --> 01:07:27,358
President Fevella?

881
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:27,638
Yes.

882
01:07:27,658 --> 01:07:29,319
70 affirmatives, zero in the negative.

883
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:31,740
The motion passes, the resolutions adjoined.

884
01:07:31,760 --> 01:07:48,548
2-0-676 offered by Councilor Behrs, be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the Memphis Community Media, Patrick Gordon and Cat Darnell be congratulated for receiving an overall excellence award from the Alliance for Community Media and thanked for their hard work to inform the community and

885
01:07:49,748 --> 01:07:51,928
20679 is offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

886
01:07:51,948 --> 01:08:06,191
Be it resolved that the council congratulate Patrick Gordon for his leadership, knowledge, expertise in public access television and his tireless dedication to the citizens of Medford for winning the overall excellence award for community media in the Northeast region.

887
01:08:06,811 --> 01:08:08,471
Councilor Behrs and Councilor Scarpelli.

888
01:08:08,491 --> 01:08:09,231
Councilor Behrs.

889
01:08:09,452 --> 01:08:10,292
Thank you, Mr. President.

890
01:08:10,332 --> 01:08:13,192
I'll be brief and then happy to turn it over to Councilor Scarpelli.

891
01:08:13,992 --> 01:08:17,753
But I just filed this to commend the fantastic work of Medford Community Media.

892
01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:24,195
Patrick, Kat, and everyone else who have done so much with a limited budget and received an award.

893
01:08:24,916 --> 01:08:38,988
And they're keeping us connected via Zoom for council meetings, getting information out to the public, coronavirus information, and really just doing whatever they can to use Medford Community Media as a resource at this time.

894
01:08:39,068 --> 01:08:45,374
So I think it's a well-earned reward, and I'm happy to hear from my fellow councillor who I think agrees with me.

895
01:08:46,424 --> 01:08:48,105
Councilor Scott Kelly, thank you, Councilor Baird.

896
01:08:48,365 --> 01:08:50,906
Thank you, Councilor Baird, thank you, Councilor, President Falco.

897
01:08:52,127 --> 01:08:53,327
This is a different time.

898
01:08:53,367 --> 01:09:12,637
I think when you talk about public access that was here in the past, you had a few TV shows that we loved and the community got involved, but when you're talking about the dedication and the tireless effort of Patrick Gordon and what you see, what he's done over the last 10 months, when our world changed in turn to Zoom,

899
01:09:13,568 --> 01:09:14,629
a zoom society.

900
01:09:15,350 --> 01:09:19,373
You're talking, there are days that Patrick's doing seven zoom calls a day.

901
01:09:19,413 --> 01:09:30,364
Now remember, it's a man who has a family and a staff of one and, and still, and still putting together one of the finest

902
01:09:32,125 --> 01:09:36,550
public access television programs, media centers in the state.

903
01:09:37,111 --> 01:09:50,186
So I think we have to understand that we're very lucky that we have probably one of the most state of the art facilities at Medford High School, which has been before the pandemic struck.

904
01:09:51,493 --> 01:10:02,617
the discussions with students and teachers and having that on site and learning from Patrick's expertise, I think it really, really shows with this award.

905
01:10:02,637 --> 01:10:04,938
I think that we'll be seeing many, many more.

906
01:10:04,998 --> 01:10:07,218
And I think we need to applaud his efforts.

907
01:10:07,278 --> 01:10:13,561
When you're talking about accomplishing things with nothing, that's what Patrick's doing.

908
01:10:15,401 --> 01:10:20,243
So I really, I think we need to really

909
01:10:21,484 --> 01:10:25,089
Go by and see him, send him an email, let him know how great he's been.

910
01:10:25,129 --> 01:10:30,776
Because I think it's important that we don't lose people like Patrick in our community.

911
01:10:30,817 --> 01:10:38,307
I think that in the past we've had some rocky roads and we've had some negative dialogue.

912
01:10:39,468 --> 01:10:45,031
Through it all, he stands above it and makes sure he brings the best product forward.

913
01:10:45,412 --> 01:10:49,294
And with this award, it just shows you that it's being recognized nationwide now.

914
01:10:49,414 --> 01:10:55,658
So again, congratulations and we should all applaud Patrick Gordon.

915
01:10:55,738 --> 01:10:56,759
So thank you, Mr. President.

916
01:10:59,939 --> 01:11:00,760
Thank you, Mr. President.

917
01:11:01,320 --> 01:11:10,346
Again, overall excellence award for Patrick and Cat is to say the least, I think Councilor Scott Pelley said it the best.

918
01:11:10,946 --> 01:11:22,533
He's ushered us into a whole new period of a way of living and how these meetings are conducted throughout, not just our meetings, but meetings throughout the whole city in this difficult time.

919
01:11:25,963 --> 01:11:28,464
The guy has worked countless hours.

920
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:31,666
I mean, he's been here many hours with us, day and night.

921
01:11:31,686 --> 01:11:32,386
He's got a family.

922
01:11:32,926 --> 01:11:42,371
And again, he's just to be commended for his overall excellence award, which is a great achievement for him on a limited budget and a limited staff.

923
01:11:42,391 --> 01:11:46,213
So Patrick and Kat, congratulations to both of you.

924
01:11:46,573 --> 01:11:47,433
Outstanding job.

925
01:11:48,634 --> 01:11:49,754
Thank you, Vice President Caviello.

926
01:11:49,774 --> 01:11:50,395
Counselor Marks.

927
01:11:52,069 --> 01:11:56,871
Thank you, Mr. President, and I'd be remiss if I didn't say anything about Patrick.

928
01:11:57,751 --> 01:12:11,557
Patrick's been on board several years now, Mr. President, and let me tell you, the change in this community regarding PEG access, which is the public educational and government channel,

929
01:12:12,157 --> 01:12:16,320
has been tremendous over the last several years since Patrick came on board.

930
01:12:16,340 --> 01:12:26,468
I remember a day when we used to go in the side room, Mr. President, and have some meetings, committee hall meetings and subcommittee meetings.

931
01:12:26,888 --> 01:12:27,448
And guess what?

932
01:12:27,769 --> 01:12:30,251
That side room now, it's all televised.

933
01:12:30,971 --> 01:12:42,027
It's all open for the public, it's all transparent, and that is largely due to the efforts of Patrick Gordon and the expertise that he brought, Mr. President.

934
01:12:42,468 --> 01:12:47,335
And I agree with my colleagues over the last 10 months, Patrick was the first to step up.

935
01:12:48,015 --> 01:12:59,018
and make sure that this council had a forum, make sure that we had access to Zoom, make sure that it was compatible to our equipment here, and he's done yeoman's work, Mr. President.

936
01:13:00,078 --> 01:13:05,760
There's a movement in Congress to do away with PEG access.

937
01:13:07,009 --> 01:13:18,637
And I think it would be one of the worst things to do, Mr. President, in order to stifle open dialogue, stifle participation.

938
01:13:19,758 --> 01:13:21,419
And I hope it goes nowhere.

939
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:25,142
But I know there's a movement afoot because of the cost.

940
01:13:25,682 --> 01:13:30,526
But the cost to me, the transparency

941
01:13:31,106 --> 01:13:34,928
And public input far outweighs any cost, Mr. President.

942
01:13:35,408 --> 01:13:37,069
And that's what good government's all about.

943
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:41,291
And we truly have a winner in Patrick.

944
01:13:41,852 --> 01:13:49,816
And I think Councilor Scott Pelley mentioned, it's a staff of one person, one person.

945
01:13:50,796 --> 01:13:53,057
When Patrick has to say, hey, can you do this?

946
01:13:53,077 --> 01:13:56,219
He has to look in the mirror, because he's telling himself to do it.

947
01:13:57,447 --> 01:13:58,908
There's no one else in his office.

948
01:13:59,588 --> 01:14:03,289
It's amazing what this gentleman puts out for a one-person office.

949
01:14:03,629 --> 01:14:06,870
Go to Somerville, go to Malden, go to Arlington.

950
01:14:07,991 --> 01:14:12,892
They have a full-fledged department with multiple people.

951
01:14:14,293 --> 01:14:16,254
And here he is pulling it off with one person.

952
01:14:16,614 --> 01:14:17,394
I want to thank him.

953
01:14:17,614 --> 01:14:21,075
It's well-warranted, Mr. President, and Patrick, keep up the good work.

954
01:14:22,236 --> 01:14:23,136
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

955
01:14:23,336 --> 01:14:25,057
We have Councilor Morrell and Councilor Knight.

956
01:14:25,077 --> 01:14:25,717
Councilor Morrell.

957
01:14:34,913 --> 01:14:35,933
Councilor Morrell, can you hear me?

958
01:14:37,334 --> 01:14:39,214
Okay, we'll go to Councilor Knight.

959
01:14:40,574 --> 01:14:42,075
Mr. President, thank you very much.

960
01:14:42,395 --> 01:14:46,736
And I'd like to take this opportunity to congratulate and thank Patrick for all he's done.

961
01:14:47,256 --> 01:14:48,756
I echo the sentiments of my colleagues.

962
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:55,038
I think when we talk about Patrick Gordon, we know that he's good at and loves what he does.

963
01:14:55,818 --> 01:15:12,467
And I think that the most embarrassing part of this whole thing is that we're actually putting Patrick in the limelight right now, because he's usually the man behind the scenes operating like a cat in the dock, someone that's always bouncing around from meeting room to meeting room, making sure the Zoom calls are set up, making sure that Zoom call's set up.

964
01:15:12,487 --> 01:15:22,193
And he's done an amazing job, not only with bringing these meetings to the public, but also with the efforts and the work that he's done with our public schools through the Metro Community Media Lab.

965
01:15:23,373 --> 01:15:29,716
Over the past 10 months or so when we've been in this crazy world, I've had the opportunity to get to know Patrick very well.

966
01:15:29,836 --> 01:15:36,679
And I consider him TV royalty, access television royalty, the count of TV three.

967
01:15:36,699 --> 01:15:40,800
He does an unbelievable job and he's someone that I really respect and thank for all the work that he's done.

968
01:15:41,140 --> 01:15:50,004
And I'm glad that he received this award because it's a reflection of the hard work and dedication that he's put forward to his position, to the pride he takes in his job, and to his commitment to this community.

969
01:15:50,024 --> 01:15:52,345
So I'm very grateful to call Patrick Gordon a friend.

970
01:15:53,287 --> 01:15:57,659
The Council TV3 in the City of Medford does an unbelievable job, Mr. President, so congratulations, Patrick.

971
01:15:58,802 --> 01:15:59,945
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

972
01:16:00,566 --> 01:16:01,328
Councilor Morrell.

973
01:16:02,443 --> 01:16:03,184
Thank you, Mr. President.

974
01:16:03,484 --> 01:16:07,026
Yeah, I'll be brief since so many of my counselors have already put forth.

975
01:16:07,066 --> 01:16:14,252
And also I missed some of that, but I believe what's happening is an internet, City Hall internet issue and nothing to do with Patrick's fine work.

976
01:16:14,352 --> 01:16:23,119
So to echo what Counselor Knight has said, I think this award is a reflection of the hard work that we know Patrick is doing constantly.

977
01:16:23,559 --> 01:16:26,281
So I echo the congratulations for him and CAPT.

978
01:16:26,441 --> 01:16:31,585
I think what he has done for this community has really been a lifeline, especially over these past 10 months.

979
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:42,313
what he's done to make it so that counselors and the public can make their best health decisions while also being engaged in city council and school committee meetings is really essential.

980
01:16:42,753 --> 01:16:50,759
And just the number of times I've seen him kind of running all over the chambers to ensure we're set up right and address anything that may arise in the building.

981
01:16:51,539 --> 01:16:58,965
This award is very much due and I shared my council colleagues in congratulating Patrick and Kat.

982
01:17:00,072 --> 01:17:01,112
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

983
01:17:01,833 --> 01:17:06,215
And if I may, I want to thank Patrick for all his hard work and dedication.

984
01:17:06,235 --> 01:17:16,679
I know when we first started doing the meetings via Zoom back in March, I always knew I didn't have to worry about the technical stuff because he would kind of get us through that, and he did.

985
01:17:17,379 --> 01:17:27,064
And coming back at the chambers, he helped with all the testing and putting everything together to make sure that we could roll to the public as smoothly as possible.

986
01:17:28,104 --> 01:17:29,445
He's done a great job at that.

987
01:17:30,045 --> 01:17:34,729
He's used some of his own equipment to actually make this happen, especially when we were first doing this in August.

988
01:17:35,489 --> 01:17:38,752
Brought in extra TVs, and he really got it up and off the ground.

989
01:17:39,072 --> 01:17:45,596
And I can't thank him enough for his hard work and his well-deserved reward, both him and Cat.

990
01:17:45,957 --> 01:17:47,298
So, Patrick, thank you very much.

991
01:17:47,938 --> 01:17:50,939
I'm not sure if you want to put it on autopilot for a minute.

992
01:17:50,999 --> 01:17:53,839
The council has a citation for you.

993
01:17:54,279 --> 01:18:11,343
The Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council accommodation to Patrick Gordon, for his leadership, knowledge, expertise in public access television, and his tireless dedication to the citizens of Medford, and for earning the overall excellence award for community media in the Northeast region.

994
01:18:11,903 --> 01:18:14,824
John C. Falcon Jr., president on behalf of the Medford City Council.

995
01:18:15,284 --> 01:18:15,824
Patrick Gordon.

996
01:18:23,397 --> 01:18:24,238
Congratulations.

997
01:18:24,298 --> 01:18:25,280
Say a few words.

998
01:18:25,400 --> 01:18:26,982
Congratulations.

999
01:18:27,002 --> 01:18:27,443
Thank you.

1000
01:18:28,064 --> 01:18:28,805
Thank you very much.

1001
01:18:29,907 --> 01:18:33,231
Hopefully our internet stays up while I talk.

1002
01:18:33,852 --> 01:18:37,798
I've received numerous messages from people in the city congratulating me.

1003
01:18:38,783 --> 01:18:41,666
It really, the award is for everybody in the city.

1004
01:18:41,766 --> 01:18:50,014
It's every resident that's come down and become a member, every member that's taken training and become a producer and every producer that's created content for their city.

1005
01:18:50,774 --> 01:19:02,225
It's every host and guest and camera operator and editor and council members and everyone that volunteers on a city board, organizations, that's community, that's community media.

1006
01:19:02,245 --> 01:19:04,087
So I wanna thank everybody in the city for

1007
01:19:04,956 --> 01:19:07,298
making community media something to be proud of.

1008
01:19:07,678 --> 01:19:08,419
So thank you.

1009
01:19:08,679 --> 01:19:09,059
Thank you.

1010
01:19:12,502 --> 01:19:12,983
Thank you.

1011
01:19:14,664 --> 01:19:17,827
On the motion of council night, seconded by vice-president Cardiello.

1012
01:19:17,887 --> 01:19:19,088
Clerk Hernandez, please call the roll.

1013
01:19:24,454 --> 01:19:24,995
Councilor Behrs.

1014
01:19:25,175 --> 01:19:25,535
Yes.

1015
01:19:25,815 --> 01:19:26,976
Vice President Carabiello.

1016
01:19:27,036 --> 01:19:27,317
Yes.

1017
01:19:27,577 --> 01:19:28,178
Councilor Night.

1018
01:19:28,238 --> 01:19:28,638
Yes.

1019
01:19:28,658 --> 01:19:29,259
Councilor Marks.

1020
01:19:29,439 --> 01:19:29,799
Yes.

1021
01:19:30,059 --> 01:19:30,820
Councilor Morrell.

1022
01:19:31,301 --> 01:19:31,561
Yes.

1023
01:19:32,141 --> 01:19:32,922
Councilor Scarpelli.

1024
01:19:32,942 --> 01:19:33,102
Yes.

1025
01:19:33,583 --> 01:19:34,283
President Fevella.

1026
01:19:34,303 --> 01:19:36,165
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1027
01:19:36,185 --> 01:19:38,227
The motion passes.

1028
01:19:38,247 --> 01:19:39,448
2-0-678 offered by Councilor Night.

1029
01:19:39,588 --> 01:19:46,996
Whereas the Memphis City Council has made repeated requests to be provided with monthly copies of the city warrant articles.

1030
01:19:47,176 --> 01:19:49,017
And whereas these repeated requests

1031
01:19:49,638 --> 01:19:51,960
have gone unfulfilled by the city administration.

1032
01:19:52,560 --> 01:20:00,946
Be it resolved that the city solicitor provide the council with a draft ordinance requiring that the council be provided with the warrant articles on a monthly basis.

1033
01:20:01,666 --> 01:20:10,812
And be it further resolved that the city solicitor send a freedom of information request to the city administration on behalf of the city council requesting the following information.

1034
01:20:11,452 --> 01:20:14,454
Copies of all warrant articles for the period of January 1st,

1035
01:20:18,178 --> 01:20:19,540
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1036
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:25,807
As you're well aware, and my council colleagues are, the Warren articles are actually a copy of the bills that we pay at the end of every month.

1037
01:20:26,468 --> 01:20:33,056
And when we talk about transparency in government, one of the things we always hear is, follow the dollar, follow the dollar.

1038
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:43,600
And I think it's very important, Mr. President, if we are going to be a transparent community financially with an open checkbook, that this council is made aware of where the money is being spent and when it's being spent.

1039
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:48,682
For example, our vendors that are providing testing for COVID-19.

1040
01:20:49,642 --> 01:20:50,222
have to get paid?

1041
01:20:50,682 --> 01:20:51,322
Are they being paid?

1042
01:20:51,542 --> 01:20:52,263
Do they have a balance?

1043
01:20:52,963 --> 01:20:54,683
How much money have we invested in COVID testing?

1044
01:20:54,723 --> 01:20:57,064
Is this money reimbursable through the CARES Act or the HEROES Act?

1045
01:20:57,684 --> 01:21:02,445
This is good information for us, Mr. President, to have to make solid, strong financial decisions moving forward.

1046
01:21:03,085 --> 01:21:09,427
So absent the fact that multiple requests have gone unanswered, I do think that this is a good legislative

1047
01:21:10,638 --> 01:21:16,460
in action, because it will provide us the opportunity to receive this information on a monthly basis required by ordinance.

1048
01:21:16,861 --> 01:21:30,886
And then after that, we will have that information at our fingertips to disperse and spread to those people that have questions, to maybe possibly adopt a council record, a council rule where we read it into the record at the beginning of every month, what we spent money on the previous month.

1049
01:21:31,366 --> 01:21:35,448
So there's that fiscal and financial transparency here in the community, Mr. President, that we hear so much about.

1050
01:21:36,088 --> 01:21:51,671
So with that being said I'd ask my council colleagues to support this measure and ask that the city solicitor draft an ordinance for us to review to peruse and debate and in the meantime she can also send across a freedom of information request for us to get those Warren articles that we've been waiting for for an extended period of time so that we can begin to examine those as well.

1051
01:21:52,791 --> 01:21:53,751
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1052
01:21:56,592 --> 01:22:01,253
On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Carviello, any questions from the council?

1053
01:22:03,498 --> 01:22:05,780
If I may really quick, Council Knight, thank you for bringing this forward.

1054
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:11,985
I think it's, I like the idea of actually seeing the warrants on a monthly or even weekly basis.

1055
01:22:12,005 --> 01:22:18,311
Remember when we were on the school committee, that's a report that we got on basically, I think it was twice a month.

1056
01:22:19,307 --> 01:22:21,188
And it was very informative.

1057
01:22:21,208 --> 01:22:23,209
So I thank you for bringing that forward.

1058
01:22:23,649 --> 01:22:28,571
On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Caviello, Clerk Herterby, please call the roll.

1059
01:22:29,191 --> 01:22:37,294
Is the motion to refer to the city solicitor to draft the ordinance and send the FOIA request and for approval, or is it just for approval of the resolution?

1060
01:22:38,314 --> 01:22:41,795
Well, the resolution is to have it drafted and do the Freedom of Information request.

1061
01:22:41,875 --> 01:22:42,956
OK, so just for approval.

1062
01:22:42,976 --> 01:22:44,677
So if we approve the resolution, we're telling her to do that.

1063
01:22:45,057 --> 01:22:45,297
Correct.

1064
01:22:45,797 --> 01:22:48,338
On that motion, Councilor Marks.

1065
01:22:49,502 --> 01:22:50,343
Thank you, Mr. President.

1066
01:22:50,403 --> 01:22:54,168
I want to thank my council colleague, Councilor Knight, for putting this on.

1067
01:22:55,550 --> 01:23:03,719
My question to the Chief of Staff is, what would it take to put together a monthly warrant articles for this council?

1068
01:23:08,082 --> 01:23:10,083
Dave, I'm trying to, there you go.

1069
01:23:10,183 --> 01:23:11,064
Thank you, Mr. President.

1070
01:23:11,104 --> 01:23:11,805
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1071
01:23:12,265 --> 01:23:18,970
It's, I'll defer to Alicia Nunley and John, the management of the reports, but they're not, it's not a huge report that it is to be run.

1072
01:23:19,390 --> 01:23:22,592
I was unaware of the robust and we can make sure that we can expedite those to you.

1073
01:23:22,612 --> 01:23:23,913
I don't want to take that as a tribute.

1074
01:23:27,075 --> 01:23:29,157
So this is a doable request then?

1075
01:23:29,917 --> 01:23:30,658
For sure, yep.

1076
01:23:31,969 --> 01:23:43,514
So do we, and I appreciate what Councilor Knight is offering, but do we have to go through the process of creating an ordinance in order to get this reporting?

1077
01:23:43,934 --> 01:23:50,817
Or is this something we can receive a commitment that this will be a monthly report going forward that we will receive from the administration?

1078
01:23:52,886 --> 01:23:54,227
I can give you that commitment.

1079
01:23:54,307 --> 01:24:02,194
I won't weigh into the council prerogative as to drafting the ordinance as it pertains to it, but I'll speak with Alicia and it shouldn't be a problem to get you this information.

1080
01:24:04,976 --> 01:24:07,077
I'm not opposed to putting together an ordinance.

1081
01:24:07,738 --> 01:24:10,560
I think that would be a last resort in my opinion.

1082
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:18,366
I think there should be that mutual respect among the legislative and the executive branch when we request information.

1083
01:24:18,826 --> 01:24:20,428
I appreciate my colleagues,

1084
01:24:21,328 --> 01:24:28,452
frustration with not receiving things in a timely fashion, especially when it comes to financial reports.

1085
01:24:29,192 --> 01:24:31,894
I know other communities, they meet constantly.

1086
01:24:32,214 --> 01:24:39,077
They have working groups that meet and go over warrant articles and so forth and see where the spending is and make recommendations.

1087
01:24:39,738 --> 01:24:46,221
And as far as I know, that's really never happened with this council and I can appreciate this fact.

1088
01:24:47,021 --> 01:24:50,384
that this is something that we should be receiving going forward.

1089
01:24:50,424 --> 01:24:52,285
So, you know, I'll support this tonight.

1090
01:24:53,266 --> 01:25:00,551
I hope there's no need to draft an ordinance and so forth, but if that's the druthers of this council, I will support that as well.

1091
01:25:01,652 --> 01:25:02,573
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1092
01:25:03,273 --> 01:25:04,795
Any other questions, comments from the council?

1093
01:25:06,196 --> 01:25:07,216
Okay, any questions?

1094
01:25:07,977 --> 01:25:08,457
No hands up.

1095
01:25:08,597 --> 01:25:13,301
Okay, on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Carviello, Clerk Carter, please call the roll.

1096
01:25:13,665 --> 01:25:14,245
Councilor Behrs?

1097
01:25:14,405 --> 01:25:14,686
Yes.

1098
01:25:15,246 --> 01:25:16,187
Vice President Kerrio?

1099
01:25:16,347 --> 01:25:16,687
Yes.

1100
01:25:17,287 --> 01:25:17,828
Councilor Knight?

1101
01:25:17,848 --> 01:25:18,208
Yes.

1102
01:25:18,628 --> 01:25:19,229
Councilor Marks?

1103
01:25:19,729 --> 01:25:19,949
Yes.

1104
01:25:20,349 --> 01:25:21,010
Councilor Morrell?

1105
01:25:22,808 --> 01:25:23,648
Councilor Scarpelli?

1106
01:25:23,849 --> 01:25:24,129
Yes.

1107
01:25:24,229 --> 01:25:25,029
President Falco?

1108
01:25:25,109 --> 01:25:25,349
Yes.

1109
01:25:25,449 --> 01:25:27,891
Seven affirmative, zero negative, the motion passes.

1110
01:25:27,911 --> 01:25:30,332
2-0-6-8-4, offered by Council and Ite.

1111
01:25:31,012 --> 01:25:49,002
Whereas City Ordinance 94-35, general provisions relevant to the City Council and Board of Appeals requires the City Council to adopt and file with the City Clerk rules relating to applications for special permits, including but not limited to the procedure for

1112
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:58,026
application for special permits in the manner and type of maps and other materials that shall be required.

1113
01:25:58,126 --> 01:26:10,697
Be it resolved that the city council provide the council with a copy of the current procedure and requirements, and be it further resolved that a committee of the whole be scheduled to review the procedures and requirements.

1114
01:26:11,338 --> 01:26:11,878
That's all right.

1115
01:26:12,519 --> 01:26:13,780
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1116
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:16,802
In recent months, we've had a number of

1117
01:26:17,797 --> 01:26:20,258
meetings, public hearings related to special permits.

1118
01:26:20,378 --> 01:26:30,221
But more importantly, we've had a lot of discussion relative to the codification of our existing ordinance and the potential to expand the special permit granting authority to various bodies in this community.

1119
01:26:31,362 --> 01:26:33,062
You know, one of those bodies is the city council.

1120
01:26:33,722 --> 01:26:47,547
And from what I understand, a lot of the proposals that are going to be coming back to us relative to the codification of our zoning are going to require some city council special permit issuance, some changes to the issuance of permits and the governing authority of the special permit granting authority, I should say.

1121
01:26:48,167 --> 01:26:55,791
So with that being said, Mr. President, I thought it would make sense for us to take a look at the existing requirements that are currently filed with the city clerk's office as required by city ordinance.

1122
01:26:56,271 --> 01:27:01,034
Review them to see if they're up to date and up to par with the information and materials that we need to make informed decisions.

1123
01:27:01,694 --> 01:27:14,461
So I think that this is an opportunity for us to review the way that we do business, the way that we conduct business, the type of materials, maps, and other type of information that we require as we deliberate and discuss creating special permits in this community.

1124
01:27:14,941 --> 01:27:22,084
I think it will provide us with an opportunity to be more informed, better informed, and also for an opportunity for us to review and update the existing requirements.

1125
01:27:22,524 --> 01:27:30,488
For example, we have a lot of talk about special permits and our ability to require the developer to conduct a traffic study or pay for a traffic study.

1126
01:27:31,368 --> 01:27:34,410
But our existing requirements might not necessarily speak to that.

1127
01:27:34,890 --> 01:27:42,654
So I think that there's an opportunity for us to review these and to strengthen them to put us in a better place to address issues that require special permit granting authority, Mr. President.

1128
01:27:42,674 --> 01:27:52,399
So I ask my council colleagues to support this quest for review of information and hopefully an opportunity to improve the way that we do business and do things a little bit better than we are.

1129
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:53,940
Thank you, Councilor Ike.

1130
01:27:55,061 --> 01:27:56,862
Any questions, comments from the council?

1131
01:28:00,538 --> 01:28:00,878
Second.

1132
01:28:00,898 --> 01:28:05,040
Okay, on the... Okay, no hands up here.

1133
01:28:05,100 --> 01:28:09,021
Okay, on the motion of Councilor Scott Fevella, seconded by Councilor Pierce.

1134
01:28:09,061 --> 01:28:10,301
Clerk, please call the roll.

1135
01:28:10,321 --> 01:28:10,381
Yes.

1136
01:28:13,502 --> 01:28:13,622
Yes.

1137
01:28:13,662 --> 01:28:13,743
Yes.

1138
01:28:13,783 --> 01:28:14,043
Yes.

1139
01:28:14,183 --> 01:28:14,383
Yes.

1140
01:28:22,503 --> 01:28:22,743
Yes.

1141
01:28:23,803 --> 01:28:24,023
Yes.

1142
01:28:24,043 --> 01:28:25,884
7, 8, 4, 0, negative.

1143
01:28:26,004 --> 01:28:26,924
The motion passes.

1144
01:28:26,944 --> 01:28:26,924
2, 0, 9, 6, 8, 5.

1145
01:28:28,144 --> 01:28:29,565
Offered by Council on 8.

1146
01:28:29,705 --> 01:28:33,686
Be it resolved that the rules of the Memphis City Council be amended as follows.

1147
01:28:33,806 --> 01:28:34,506
New section.

1148
01:28:35,006 --> 01:28:35,806
Public hearings.

1149
01:28:36,406 --> 01:28:41,167
Matters requiring public hearing before the City Council shall be conducted as follows.

1150
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:41,868
Number 1.

1151
01:28:42,688 --> 01:28:44,208
The petition is read into the record.

1152
01:28:44,788 --> 01:28:45,268
Number 2.

1153
01:28:45,328 --> 01:28:49,789
The petitioner provides an explanation of the matter requiring a public hearing.

1154
01:28:50,290 --> 01:28:50,790
Number 3.

1155
01:28:50,830 --> 01:28:52,270
The public hearing is conducted.

1156
01:28:52,950 --> 01:28:59,055
Number four, following the public hearing, a six calendar day public comment period shall commence.

1157
01:29:00,296 --> 01:29:04,440
Public comments shall be submitted in writing to the clerk.

1158
01:29:04,940 --> 01:29:09,884
Number five, the council shall neither approve nor deny any public require, I'm sorry.

1159
01:29:10,425 --> 01:29:19,052
Number five, the council shall neither approve nor deny any matter requiring public hearing until the conclusion of the public comment period

1160
01:29:20,266 --> 01:29:22,747
and less waived by a majority vote of the council.

1161
01:29:23,348 --> 01:29:23,848
Councilor Knight.

1162
01:29:24,948 --> 01:29:26,249
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1163
01:29:27,510 --> 01:29:33,713
Earlier this evening when our meeting opened up, we started off with a public hearing relative to a grant of location on Mitchell Ave.

1164
01:29:34,473 --> 01:29:43,478
And the procedure was we call the public hearing to order, we read it into the record, and then we ask if people are opposed to or in favor of the project that's before us.

1165
01:29:44,512 --> 01:29:45,714
Then we close the public hearing.

1166
01:29:45,734 --> 01:29:52,602
Then we allow the petitioner to provide us with a presentation as to what the project's going to be.

1167
01:29:54,966 --> 01:30:00,713
Over the years serving as a counselor, one of the things that's frustrated me is the process and the way that our public hearings are conducted.

1168
01:30:01,420 --> 01:30:06,302
because we're asking people whether or not they're in favor or opposed to a project that they haven't seen a presentation on yet.

1169
01:30:07,702 --> 01:30:17,666
A lot of times, individuals in this community get their local news through the city council, and the first time that they see an issue on the agenda is at this public hearing.

1170
01:30:18,406 --> 01:30:25,748
So what happens is the council's having a public hearing, people are offering opinions as to whether they're in favor or opposed to it, then we're closing the public hearing.

1171
01:30:26,208 --> 01:30:30,530
Then we're turning the floor over to the developer, or the applicant, I should say,

1172
01:30:31,010 --> 01:30:34,452
And the applicant gives a presentation, the council asks questions, and then we vote on it.

1173
01:30:35,132 --> 01:30:41,075
I think it might make more sense for us, Mr. President, to have the petitioner give a presentation as to what the application is before the body.

1174
01:30:41,595 --> 01:30:47,818
So that individuals that may not know if they're opposed or in favor of the project have an opportunity to understand what it's about.

1175
01:30:48,924 --> 01:30:50,724
before they're asked to come up and speak on it.

1176
01:30:51,385 --> 01:30:55,526
Secondly, what this proposal would do, and I really don't care what the language in terms of where it goes.

1177
01:30:55,766 --> 01:30:57,086
It's something that's going to have to be hashed out.

1178
01:30:57,126 --> 01:31:00,607
This isn't something that is at the end of the line discussion.

1179
01:31:00,807 --> 01:31:01,827
This is just a launching pad.

1180
01:31:02,387 --> 01:31:07,068
But when the public hearings closed, the council then usually votes on the matter immediately thereafter.

1181
01:31:07,629 --> 01:31:09,049
And there's no waiting period.

1182
01:31:09,089 --> 01:31:11,550
So the public hearing closes, and then they said, OK, now on the petition.

1183
01:31:11,590 --> 01:31:12,250
Is everybody in favor?

1184
01:31:12,290 --> 01:31:13,210
But OK, sure, we'll grant it.

1185
01:31:14,675 --> 01:31:24,026
Because people don't necessarily read the council agenda and see what's on it, and there are individuals in the community that might get their news and understanding from community access, from the great work that Patrick Gordon is doing on account of community media.

1186
01:31:25,287 --> 01:31:32,375
It might make sense for us, Mr. President, to allow a six day comment period for individuals to express whether or not they're in favor or opposed after the close of the public hearing.

1187
01:31:32,615 --> 01:31:33,996
before we take the matter up for a vote.

1188
01:31:34,476 --> 01:31:54,329
It's just a pet peeve of mine as to the way that things operate and I'm hoping that maybe we can take some steps to correct the way that we do it and improve the way that we do it so that individuals are more informed when they're speaking at public hearings whether they're in favor or opposed to them and so that residents in the community after hearing the presentation from the administration get the I mean the applicant get the opportunity to chew on it for a couple of days

1189
01:31:54,809 --> 01:31:59,531
and then decide whether or not they are in favor or against it, and send that information to us so that we can read it.

1190
01:31:59,631 --> 01:32:01,552
Food for thought, as we say, Mr. President.

1191
01:32:02,173 --> 01:32:05,854
So with that being said, this is something that, you know, I'm not too concerned about it passing right now.

1192
01:32:05,874 --> 01:32:08,836
It can go to subcommittee, it can go to committee of the whole, whatever it may be.

1193
01:32:09,056 --> 01:32:12,337
I'm comfortable with the language, but I wrote it, and this is the first time most people have seen it.

1194
01:32:12,457 --> 01:32:16,559
So, you know, I certainly have no problem with this going through its diligent process.

1195
01:32:16,879 --> 01:32:24,303
So with that being said, Mr. President, I ask my council colleagues to support the matter, to be referred either to the rules committee or committee of the whole for further discussion, debate, and deliberation.

1196
01:32:25,345 --> 01:32:26,165
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1197
01:32:26,185 --> 01:32:29,047
Motion to send this to the Rules Committee, Mr. President.

1198
01:32:29,107 --> 01:32:29,427
Second.

1199
01:32:29,567 --> 01:32:36,670
OK, on the motion by Vice President Carviello to send this paper to the Rules Committee, that is seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

1200
01:32:36,970 --> 01:32:37,530
Councilor Marks.

1201
01:32:37,931 --> 01:32:38,751
Thank you, Mr. President.

1202
01:32:38,771 --> 01:32:45,154
I think my colleague, Councilor Knight, made a great explanation of what this is trying to accomplish.

1203
01:32:45,794 --> 01:32:52,257
And many of the crucial pieces of legislation that we put forth require three readings.

1204
01:32:53,017 --> 01:33:00,262
And I think what Councilor Knight is getting at, a public hearing is really no difference than any other important document we work on.

1205
01:33:00,962 --> 01:33:07,627
And what happens in a city ordinance, the first reading is what appears on the agenda.

1206
01:33:08,027 --> 01:33:10,769
So a public hearing appears on the agenda for the first time.

1207
01:33:11,469 --> 01:33:22,237
The difference between the public hearing and the three readings is the three readings then require you to put notice in the newspaper, then require you to come back for a third reading for final approval.

1208
01:33:23,441 --> 01:33:25,381
None of that takes place during a public hearing.

1209
01:33:25,401 --> 01:33:26,602
So my colleagues write.

1210
01:33:27,002 --> 01:33:31,863
What typically happens is we'll listen, we'll hear both sides, and then typically act.

1211
01:33:32,343 --> 01:33:34,763
So I agree with 90% of this language.

1212
01:33:35,683 --> 01:33:36,263
I'm not sure.

1213
01:33:37,624 --> 01:33:41,024
The six-day calendar day, I think we can debate about that.

1214
01:33:41,664 --> 01:33:45,325
But there has to be a grace period, which allows for public comments.

1215
01:33:45,505 --> 01:33:46,325
And I agree with that.

1216
01:33:46,645 --> 01:33:50,406
Public comments can also be put forth ahead of time

1217
01:33:50,846 --> 01:33:58,337
However, if you're not aware of what the petition is going after until that meeting happens, then how do you make a comment on something you're not aware of?

1218
01:33:58,357 --> 01:34:04,887
And there may not be enough information that's presented on the council agenda or so forth to make an informed decision.

1219
01:34:05,748 --> 01:34:07,110
So I have no problem with that.

1220
01:34:07,650 --> 01:34:22,682
And I think the section five, which gives us the option, sometimes we may have a public hearing that we want that vote that night, because it's an issue of utmost importance, public safety, whatever it might be, and we want to act quickly.

1221
01:34:23,183 --> 01:34:29,008
And this gives us an option to act quickly by a majority vote of the council if we deem necessary.

1222
01:34:29,368 --> 01:34:31,429
So I like 90% of this language.

1223
01:34:31,990 --> 01:34:36,834
I would ask that it be sent to, I concur with.

1224
01:34:37,154 --> 01:34:39,956
rules with Council Vice President Carviello.

1225
01:34:40,676 --> 01:34:41,657
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1226
01:34:42,417 --> 01:34:44,239
Any other questions, comments from the Council?

1227
01:34:44,899 --> 01:34:45,779
Okay, anyone?

1228
01:34:46,040 --> 01:34:46,760
No one has their hand up.

1229
01:34:47,421 --> 01:34:55,586
On the motion of Vice President Carviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, to send this paper to the Rules Subcommittee, which is chaired by Councilor Knight.

1230
01:34:56,366 --> 01:34:58,567
On that motion, Clerk Hutterby, please call the roll.

1231
01:34:59,408 --> 01:35:00,008
Councilor Behrs?

1232
01:35:00,088 --> 01:35:00,349
Yes.

1233
01:35:00,649 --> 01:35:01,569
Vice President Carviello?

1234
01:35:01,729 --> 01:35:01,950
Yes.

1235
01:35:02,210 --> 01:35:02,730
Councilor Knight?

1236
01:35:02,830 --> 01:35:03,150
Yes.

1237
01:35:03,350 --> 01:35:03,931
Councilor Marks?

1238
01:35:04,131 --> 01:35:04,491
Yes.

1239
01:35:04,851 --> 01:35:05,472
Councilor Morrell?

1240
01:35:06,852 --> 01:35:07,612
Councilor Scarpelli?

1241
01:35:07,832 --> 01:35:08,013
Yes.

1242
01:35:08,093 --> 01:35:08,833
President Fevella?

1243
01:35:09,033 --> 01:35:09,273
Yes.

1244
01:35:09,453 --> 01:35:11,914
Setting the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

1245
01:35:11,934 --> 01:35:25,040
20-686 offered by Councilor Beers, be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the city administration implement an eviction moratorium to protect Memphis residents during the severe COVID-19 surge this winter.

1246
01:35:25,741 --> 01:35:30,763
Councilor Beers, I'm inclined to rule this out of order.

1247
01:35:31,263 --> 01:35:34,825
And the reason why is, and I'm sympathetic to this issue, believe me.

1248
01:35:35,785 --> 01:35:39,949
but there's a paper that is currently in subcommittee that I think you offered.

1249
01:35:39,969 --> 01:35:42,090
I believe it's in the housing subcommittee.

1250
01:35:42,150 --> 01:35:44,052
It's been there since April.

1251
01:35:45,293 --> 01:35:48,195
And I believe there may have been a meeting.

1252
01:35:48,215 --> 01:35:50,997
Maybe the clerk can clarify on that, but it hasn't been voted out.

1253
01:35:52,098 --> 01:35:54,620
And it's basically the exact same paper.

1254
01:35:54,760 --> 01:36:00,405
So, so that there, I mean, if it's in subcommittee, it really needs to be,

1255
01:36:01,986 --> 01:36:05,008
You have to have a meeting on that because it's already been voted to go to subcommittee.

1256
01:36:05,929 --> 01:36:10,092
And I mean, I completely understand where you're coming from with the resolution.

1257
01:36:10,152 --> 01:36:12,154
Like I said, I'm sympathetic to it.

1258
01:36:13,575 --> 01:36:19,039
And I believe the state moratorium has expired, but I think the CDC has one to leave the end of the year.

1259
01:36:19,059 --> 01:36:20,440
And I know there's, I think a pending bill.

1260
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:22,862
I believe there's a pending bill in Congress as well.

1261
01:36:23,562 --> 01:36:24,203
to extend it.

1262
01:36:24,483 --> 01:36:25,103
I could be wrong.

1263
01:36:25,163 --> 01:36:25,744
I could be wrong.

1264
01:36:25,764 --> 01:36:43,059
So, but, um, I mean, if, if I may, if I may, I also believe that, um, this would have to go, I think it would have to go to the city solicitor as well, because I don't even know if we can do this, because I think, uh, state law probably trumps what we do here in this case.

1265
01:36:43,199 --> 01:36:44,841
But with that being said,

1266
01:36:45,695 --> 01:36:47,518
This paper is currently in subcommittee.

1267
01:36:47,578 --> 01:36:49,561
And like I said, it's been there since April.

1268
01:36:49,701 --> 01:36:56,412
And it really needs to be, since it's already here, it really needs to be, a subcommittee meeting needs to happen to take action on it.

1269
01:36:56,492 --> 01:36:58,916
We held the subcommittee meeting on the matter at the

1270
01:36:59,944 --> 01:37:03,367
So I filed 2302 on April 7th, which is similar.

1271
01:37:04,347 --> 01:37:10,052
We held a subcommittee on April 25th discussing both 20-300 and 20-302.

1272
01:37:11,172 --> 01:37:13,334
And by then, the state bill had passed.

1273
01:37:13,414 --> 01:37:15,255
So we discussed it in the subcommittee.

1274
01:37:15,676 --> 01:37:16,837
The state bill had passed.

1275
01:37:16,957 --> 01:37:19,419
We didn't take action on it at that time.

1276
01:37:20,481 --> 01:37:28,767
So because the state had taken action in lieu of the request that I had made, that has now expired.

1277
01:37:29,507 --> 01:37:39,574
We did support on 1013-20-595, which is to support the Housing Stability Act, which would reinitiate the eviction moratorium at the state level.

1278
01:37:40,234 --> 01:37:45,818
That's been almost three months since our resolution was passed, and that bill has not seen action.

1279
01:37:46,539 --> 01:37:48,380
So I understand what you're saying.

1280
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:49,961
I think it's a different time.

1281
01:37:50,875 --> 01:37:55,219
the context of the subcommittee meeting we had was that the state had taken action.

1282
01:37:55,300 --> 01:38:00,084
So it was in the report, the report was sent up here, and the report was approved.

1283
01:38:00,184 --> 01:38:08,892
It is my first year, but my understanding is that we had taken that issue, placed it on file as part of the report.

1284
01:38:10,093 --> 01:38:14,738
I believe, if I'm correct, and the clerk would have to confirm, I believe that that paper is still in subcommittee.

1285
01:38:16,468 --> 01:38:18,389
The paper is still in the subcommittee, yes.

1286
01:38:18,450 --> 01:38:20,891
Okay, the clerk has confirmed that it is still in subcommittee.

1287
01:38:21,652 --> 01:38:22,152
Councilor Marks.

1288
01:38:22,692 --> 01:38:26,275
Thank you, Mr. President, and Councilor Beers is correct.

1289
01:38:26,915 --> 01:38:36,162
This paper was referred to, paper 20-302, was referred to the subcommittee on the elderly and housing affairs on April 7th.

1290
01:38:36,842 --> 01:38:45,609
The paper read, it was offered by Councilor Beers, be it resolved that the mayor and Board of Health implement an emergency order to require that no landlord

1291
01:38:46,309 --> 01:38:54,753
and or owner shall enforce an eviction upon a resident of Medford, residential or commercial, during the public health crisis.

1292
01:38:55,894 --> 01:38:57,114
We did have a public hearing.

1293
01:38:57,394 --> 01:38:58,735
I was shown April 22nd.

1294
01:38:58,915 --> 01:39:00,196
I might be off on the days.

1295
01:39:00,836 --> 01:39:02,417
I know Councilor Beall said the 25th.

1296
01:39:02,457 --> 01:39:06,959
But sometime at the end of April, we did have a public meeting on this.

1297
01:39:07,799 --> 01:39:09,339
There were a number of people who attended.

1298
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:14,561
I know myself and Vice President Caviello, I believe, is on the subcommittee.

1299
01:39:15,341 --> 01:39:28,784
We actually voted on sending out to the city solicitor to draft an ordinance, Mr. President, and to provide us some assistance regarding

1300
01:39:32,457 --> 01:39:37,901
The Housing Stability Task Force, that was passed 3-0 by this council.

1301
01:39:38,942 --> 01:39:48,590
I have yet to see any response regarding that ordinance as part of paper 20-300, which I believe was offered by Councilor Beers.

1302
01:39:49,430 --> 01:39:54,975
It dealt with housing stability hotline and a housing stability task force.

1303
01:39:56,130 --> 01:40:00,672
That was to give guidance and other assistance for Method residents.

1304
01:40:01,112 --> 01:40:04,393
So I've yet to see any action on that paper as well.

1305
01:40:04,814 --> 01:40:08,895
But as far as I know, paper 20-302 was left in subcommittee.

1306
01:40:09,356 --> 01:40:15,218
And part of it was because the state was working on their eviction moratorium and their program.

1307
01:40:16,879 --> 01:40:26,203
But that doesn't mean this can't be resurrected, and I think that would be the appropriate direction to go rather than just create multiple papers.

1308
01:40:27,444 --> 01:40:29,465
This is very similar subject matter.

1309
01:40:30,005 --> 01:40:42,912
I would recommend that the chair set up an elderly and housing affairs subcommittee and discuss the paper that's currently before us, which is in line with, I believe, is being offered this evening.

1310
01:40:43,632 --> 01:40:46,035
And move in that direction, Mr. President.

1311
01:40:47,136 --> 01:40:49,158
So that's what I would recommend tonight.

1312
01:40:49,478 --> 01:40:52,401
I agree with your ruling as well, Mr. President.

1313
01:40:52,461 --> 01:40:54,223
These are very similar in nature.

1314
01:40:54,664 --> 01:41:00,389
And we're already dealing with the paper currently before subcommittee, and that could be called at any particular time.

1315
01:41:01,611 --> 01:41:02,592
Also, Mr. President.

1316
01:41:03,632 --> 01:41:06,753
Just so people are aware, there are a number of great programs.

1317
01:41:06,813 --> 01:41:17,296
I work for the Department of Housing and the rapid rehousing programs with raft, home base, there's an influx of money, transitional assistance.

1318
01:41:17,957 --> 01:41:19,177
The city council voted.

1319
01:41:19,517 --> 01:41:23,179
to use community preservation money for the rental assistance program.

1320
01:41:23,639 --> 01:41:28,682
And we just got a report on that several weeks back, how Meffitt residents are taking advantage.

1321
01:41:29,042 --> 01:41:42,950
I realize this is not a solve-all, but there are a number of programs out there to assist, Mr. President, and help residents that are the most needy in our community stay within their housing right now, Mr. President.

1322
01:41:42,990 --> 01:41:48,313
So if people aren't aware of that, and that's why I thought the housing stability hotline

1323
01:41:48,873 --> 01:41:50,675
I thought that was a magnificent idea.

1324
01:41:51,596 --> 01:42:01,046
But it's been eight months and for the past eight months people could have been using that hotline in order to make these phone calls and find out what may be available out there.

1325
01:42:01,667 --> 01:42:05,852
So I think we did miss a little bit of an opportunity to try to implement this.

1326
01:42:06,292 --> 01:42:07,373
I realize if this council

1327
01:42:07,974 --> 01:42:11,976
passes that forward, it still has to be implemented by the city administration.

1328
01:42:12,257 --> 01:42:25,785
So I'm not saying that we have the ability to single handedly do this, but I think there was some low lying fruit with the housing stability task force and the hotline that the subcommittee could have worked on in the past eight months.

1329
01:42:26,185 --> 01:42:28,967
And I'm hoping the chair calls for a meeting very shortly.

1330
01:42:29,652 --> 01:42:31,313
Thank you very much, Council.

1331
01:42:31,353 --> 01:42:32,633
Vice President Kavya Longwood.

1332
01:42:32,653 --> 01:42:33,414
Thank you, Mr. President.

1333
01:42:33,494 --> 01:42:35,635
And I think Council March is right.

1334
01:42:35,655 --> 01:42:39,777
There's a lot of programs out there right now that are available to people.

1335
01:42:39,797 --> 01:42:42,779
But we have our own program that's here.

1336
01:42:42,799 --> 01:42:49,542
And I think last I looked at, we had about $100,000 in money set aside for people that need assistance.

1337
01:42:49,622 --> 01:42:55,345
And if we can get a report back the next meeting on how much money is left in that account.

1338
01:42:58,178 --> 01:43:03,839
that we appropriated money to, and make that part of the bring here.

1339
01:43:04,419 --> 01:43:08,820
But as I say, I haven't seen a lot of people filing for that money.

1340
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:16,002
So again, I would hope that if people are in trouble, there's money there, there's assistance there, they should be taking advantage of it.

1341
01:43:17,262 --> 01:43:23,063
So as I say, Mr. Clerk, if you can make that part of this report, we can report back on how much money is left in that fund.

1342
01:43:24,920 --> 01:43:25,820
for the rental assistance.

1343
01:43:26,140 --> 01:43:27,141
Thank you, vice president.

1344
01:43:27,341 --> 01:43:32,042
So if I may, thank you, Mr. President.

1345
01:43:32,202 --> 01:43:34,903
Um, yeah, and I understand where we're coming from.

1346
01:43:34,983 --> 01:43:36,704
I'm, you know, it's been nine months.

1347
01:43:36,724 --> 01:43:38,164
We filed it early in the pandemic.

1348
01:43:38,584 --> 01:43:40,105
There was intervening circumstances.

1349
01:43:40,125 --> 01:43:41,345
So that's why I'm bringing it back up now.

1350
01:43:41,365 --> 01:43:45,907
I'm also bringing it back up because I have heard from several residents that evictions are ongoing.

1351
01:43:45,927 --> 01:43:50,068
Uh, one of the issues that we've been having, uh, both with raft and with the emergency,

1352
01:43:50,468 --> 01:44:01,973
City level emergency assistance fund has been in some cases that large property managers and certain landlords, you know, there has to be an agreement there between everybody to understand this money is going towards rent.

1353
01:44:02,093 --> 01:44:03,994
And sometimes those agreements have not been made.

1354
01:44:04,074 --> 01:44:06,335
So, you know, there have been active cases.

1355
01:44:06,969 --> 01:44:10,655
date set for evictions, you know, that's why I brought this back up.

1356
01:44:11,016 --> 01:44:20,651
And... And Councilor Beers, if I may, and I don't mean to interrupt, but this is what I said at the beginning, is this year I'm going to rule out of order because the paper is currently in.

1357
01:44:20,972 --> 01:44:21,252
Sure.

1358
01:44:23,108 --> 01:44:24,228
it's currently in subcommittee.

1359
01:44:24,569 --> 01:44:26,189
And the subcommittee has done its work.

1360
01:44:26,990 --> 01:44:34,212
And, you know, I believe you were saying, Councilor Marks, that you've started doing your work.

1361
01:44:34,532 --> 01:44:35,033
It's there.

1362
01:44:35,113 --> 01:44:37,334
So, I mean, really, that's the launching pad.

1363
01:44:37,374 --> 01:44:38,674
That's where this has to take off.

1364
01:44:38,974 --> 01:44:40,155
I mean, it's an emergency.

1365
01:44:40,235 --> 01:44:43,816
So that's why I put it on this agenda for us to ask the mayor to take action.

1366
01:44:44,096 --> 01:44:45,397
It's an emergency.

1367
01:44:45,417 --> 01:44:47,317
You know, people are being removed from their homes.

1368
01:44:47,377 --> 01:44:48,538
I'm happy to try to schedule

1369
01:44:49,278 --> 01:44:53,799
meeting after the holidays in several weeks when how many more people may have been evicted, I don't know.

1370
01:44:53,919 --> 01:44:57,100
So there is a sense of urgency as to why I put it on the agenda.

1371
01:44:57,580 --> 01:44:59,781
I understand your reasoning.

1372
01:44:59,861 --> 01:45:01,262
I may not fully agree with it.

1373
01:45:01,362 --> 01:45:12,005
But there's been massive evidence that lifting eviction moratoriums, taking them away, has actually led and driven a rise in cases and a rise in deaths.

1374
01:45:12,605 --> 01:45:16,566
So all it is is to ask the mayor to take action.

1375
01:45:17,787 --> 01:45:22,048
So I'm happy to delay this for several weeks and see what happens and try to hold a meeting.

1376
01:45:22,088 --> 01:45:28,871
Council Beers, with all due respect, you put this in on Friday, you could have called a subcommittee meeting for this week or early next.

1377
01:45:29,371 --> 01:45:36,913
So my recommendation is get the subcommittee together, that you're the chair of, and get it going for you the next week, which you can do.

1378
01:45:37,934 --> 01:45:40,234
And I would think it'll move really quick from there.

1379
01:45:40,254 --> 01:45:41,555
I would hope so.

1380
01:45:41,755 --> 01:45:42,195
I don't know.

1381
01:45:42,915 --> 01:45:43,496
Mr. President?

1382
01:45:43,736 --> 01:45:44,736
Yes, Councilor Morrell.

1383
01:45:46,458 --> 01:45:56,624
I know there are a number of people who came to speak on this, so I don't, if they're unable to speak because this is ruled out of order, if it can be made clear that they can speak at public participation at the end of the meeting.

1384
01:45:56,664 --> 01:45:57,405
That is fine.

1385
01:45:58,065 --> 01:46:07,712
And I do, since I know since a number of fellow councilors raised the issue, the resources that the city does have to offer, the city does have a number of resources people can access.

1386
01:46:08,230 --> 01:46:14,693
Unfortunately, people have to remain in their homes to be able to access them and have these relief programs.

1387
01:46:14,713 --> 01:46:19,135
So if people are evicted, their rental assistance does them no good if they are already evicted.

1388
01:46:19,728 --> 01:46:20,549
their apartment.

1389
01:46:20,569 --> 01:46:21,810
So I just want to add that point.

1390
01:46:21,830 --> 01:46:22,331
So thank you.

1391
01:46:22,351 --> 01:46:22,791
Okay.

1392
01:46:22,831 --> 01:46:23,071
Thank you.

1393
01:46:23,091 --> 01:46:23,792
Councilor Morrell.

1394
01:46:23,832 --> 01:46:31,198
So I will move this out of order, but I would encourage council to set up a subcommittee meeting as soon as possible.

1395
01:46:31,238 --> 01:46:32,159
Councilor Knight.

1396
01:46:32,299 --> 01:46:36,463
I just asked that when the subcommittee does meet that they invite the city assessor.

1397
01:46:36,903 --> 01:46:47,292
We recently had a report back from the city assessor that we have a high volume of homes in this community that are owner occupied, whether they're single family residences or multi-family residences, Mr. President.

1398
01:46:47,872 --> 01:46:52,394
And we also have people that are homeowners that are taxpayers that are hurting, Mr. President.

1399
01:46:53,275 --> 01:47:01,159
People that own a home that are also suffering from the same effects that COVID-19 is putting on people that are renters.

1400
01:47:02,579 --> 01:47:08,582
And the question comes as to what relief are these homeowners being provided if they're unable to pay their tax bill to the community?

1401
01:47:09,583 --> 01:47:14,705
We're assessing, what, 18% penalties for individuals that are unable to pay their tax bills on time at this point in time, Mr. President?

1402
01:47:14,745 --> 01:47:15,046
I think it's 18%.

1403
01:47:16,717 --> 01:47:20,420
So if we're going to look at a relief package, I think we have to have some equity.

1404
01:47:21,041 --> 01:47:22,142
It's not just about evictions.

1405
01:47:22,422 --> 01:47:24,323
It's not just about people that are renters.

1406
01:47:24,924 --> 01:47:30,288
There are homeowners in this community that are suffering too, homeowners in this community that are struggling, that have to pay a property tax bill.

1407
01:47:31,297 --> 01:47:33,480
And there's an area where we could also help.

1408
01:47:33,620 --> 01:47:38,005
So I'd ask that the city assessor be invited to the housing subcommittee meeting for her input in that regard.

1409
01:47:38,045 --> 01:47:39,266
That's a good recommendation.

1410
01:47:39,286 --> 01:47:40,027
Thank you, Councilor.

1411
01:47:40,127 --> 01:47:48,777
So I'm going to move this resolution out of order, but I would encourage anybody that wants to speak, we'll have a public participation portion coming up later on in the meeting.

1412
01:47:49,378 --> 01:47:50,739
But I want to thank everyone for

1413
01:47:51,950 --> 01:47:53,994
attending the Zoom meeting tonight.

1414
01:47:54,034 --> 01:47:58,302
So let's see, next item is communications from the mayor, 20-687, December 18th, 2020.

1415
01:48:06,038 --> 01:48:13,001
to the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford, Massachusetts 02155 regarding Community Preservation Committee.

1416
01:48:13,721 --> 01:48:22,265
Dear Mr. President and City Councilors, I respectfully submit the following recommendations of the Community Preservation Committee to the City Council for their consideration.

1417
01:48:23,005 --> 01:48:35,331
Requesting the appropriation of $30,000 from the CPA Historic Preservation Reserve to the Medford Brooks Estate Land Trust Incorporated for phase three of the restoration of an historic stone wall at the Brooks Estate.

1418
01:48:36,673 --> 01:48:51,183
Requesting the appropriation of $275,000 from the CPA General Reserve to the City of Medford Public Library for the Medford Public Library exterior space project.

1419
01:48:51,964 --> 01:49:02,952
Requesting an appropriation of $76,000 from the CPA Open Space Reserve to the City of Medford Parks Division for the rehabilitation of the Placed at Park basketball court.

1420
01:49:03,632 --> 01:49:15,015
requesting the appropriation of $15,000 from the CPA Open Space Reserve to the City of Medford Parks Division for the playground resurfacing at Tufts, Capon and Cummings Park.

1421
01:49:15,695 --> 01:49:25,398
Requesting the appropriation of $293,000 from the CPA Open Space Reserve to the City of Medford Parks Division for rehabilitation of Duggar Park Tennis Courts.

1422
01:49:26,397 --> 01:49:36,422
requesting the appropriation of $40,000 from the CPA Open Space Reserve to the City of Medford Conservation Commission for the Riverside Avenue stormwater improvements.

1423
01:49:37,102 --> 01:49:47,968
Requesting the appropriation of $322,000 from the CPA General Reserve to the City of Medford Recreation Department for the rehabilitation and improvements at Tufts Pool.

1424
01:49:48,887 --> 01:49:56,933
All projects will be tracked in the Community Preservation Fund by category, open space, historic preservation, and general reserve.

1425
01:49:57,514 --> 01:49:59,835
Sincerely, Brianna Lungo-Kernman.

1426
01:50:01,297 --> 01:50:03,498
So I believe we have Roberta Cameron with us tonight.

1427
01:50:05,039 --> 01:50:06,080
And we have Danielle Evans.

1428
01:50:06,160 --> 01:50:09,683
I'm going to unmute them just in case anyone has any questions.

1429
01:50:10,524 --> 01:50:13,526
Council, have any questions or comments on these projects?

1430
01:50:14,086 --> 01:50:15,748
Councilman Scarpelli.

1431
01:50:16,328 --> 01:50:17,289
Thank you, Mr. President.

1432
01:50:17,429 --> 01:50:18,290
Roberta, thank you for

1433
01:50:18,938 --> 01:50:30,765
your staff and your volunteers that are putting yeoman's work to make sure this committee really helps our community thrive.

1434
01:50:30,825 --> 01:50:32,606
So first I want to thank you.

1435
01:50:32,726 --> 01:50:39,070
But a question I had that a few members of the community contacted me about, these are all great projects.

1436
01:50:39,110 --> 01:50:41,412
I know that we're in full support as we move forward.

1437
01:50:41,432 --> 01:50:47,616
But if we had a project that was requested in the past,

1438
01:50:48,556 --> 01:50:54,884
Is that automatically revisited, is that something that has to be reapplied by an organization?

1439
01:50:58,834 --> 01:50:59,774
That's a good question.

1440
01:50:59,914 --> 01:51:02,636
We consider projects on a case by case basis.

1441
01:51:03,237 --> 01:51:14,525
So if a project had applied in the past and wanted, did not receive funding for one reason or another, we would invite them to reapply.

1442
01:51:15,245 --> 01:51:26,674
And most likely they would need to go through the application process again anyway, because it's really important that the recommendations that we make are tied to a specific scope and a specific budget.

1443
01:51:27,714 --> 01:51:37,537
And so we're trying to make these funds accessible to all of the best projects that meet Medford's needs.

1444
01:51:37,797 --> 01:51:42,758
So we encourage any projects to come to us.

1445
01:51:42,818 --> 01:51:53,881
And if they've been to us in the past, we'd like to work with them to see how we can make it a project that we can recommend in the future if it meets the eligibility criteria for the Community Preservation Act.

1446
01:51:54,255 --> 01:52:02,781
Okay, if you can, I know that I'll identify the phone calls that we're getting from Little League Baseball, and particularly Gillis Park.

1447
01:52:03,381 --> 01:52:13,929
And I know they've applied, but is there any way that we can, is it practiced by the committee to reach out to those organizations that

1448
01:52:14,589 --> 01:52:20,852
didn't get the funding and let them know why so they can revisit that process to move forward.

1449
01:52:20,872 --> 01:52:23,232
Because if we didn't, we'd love to see that.

1450
01:52:23,633 --> 01:52:24,973
If we did, this is great.

1451
01:52:25,353 --> 01:52:38,379
But I think the understanding for organizations like Little League that are also another volunteer group that had some concerns about the projects moving forward.

1452
01:52:38,419 --> 01:52:39,319
So thank you.

1453
01:52:39,699 --> 01:52:46,682
Actually, the good news is that the Little League and Gillis Park is already in the pipeline for funding this round.

1454
01:52:47,102 --> 01:52:57,327
The seven projects that we've brought this month are seven out of 12 projects that are in the pipeline for Community Preservation Act funding this funding round.

1455
01:52:57,947 --> 01:53:03,150
We decided that we needed to spend a little bit more time

1456
01:53:03,750 --> 01:53:18,696
developing the scope so that we are confident that we know exactly what we're recommending funding for before we can pass on a recommendation to the council for the remaining five projects that are on our slate.

1457
01:53:18,736 --> 01:53:22,078
So we anticipate after our January meeting,

1458
01:53:22,693 --> 01:53:33,697
January 14th is the next Community Preservation Committee meeting that will be bringing to the Council the remaining recommendations from this funding round.

1459
01:53:33,857 --> 01:53:37,978
And one of those will be a master plan redesigned for Gillis Park.

1460
01:53:38,338 --> 01:53:39,039
OK, that's great.

1461
01:53:39,399 --> 01:53:41,079
So that answers that question.

1462
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:43,040
So I appreciate it.

1463
01:53:43,200 --> 01:53:45,641
That helps the community understand the process.

1464
01:53:45,701 --> 01:53:50,863
And for those who don't and that won't get approval,

1465
01:53:52,044 --> 01:53:56,291
Usually they get the information with feedback, so they understand, correct?

1466
01:53:56,311 --> 01:53:57,553
I know that- Correct.

1467
01:53:57,653 --> 01:53:58,194
Right, okay, perfect.

1468
01:53:58,254 --> 01:54:00,538
And we try to work with applicants so that

1469
01:54:01,860 --> 01:54:13,983
we can make a project be well vetted and be able to recommend projects that will work for the community to the best of our capacity and our ability at that time.

1470
01:54:14,003 --> 01:54:15,504
Well, thank you, Roberta.

1471
01:54:15,704 --> 01:54:17,144
That's the answer to those questions.

1472
01:54:17,204 --> 01:54:23,326
And I appreciate, again, I appreciate all your hard work and all the volunteers that go behind the scenes and make this happen.

1473
01:54:23,346 --> 01:54:23,766
So thank you.

1474
01:54:24,686 --> 01:54:25,906
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1475
01:54:25,946 --> 01:54:27,987
Any other questions, comments from the council?

1476
01:54:29,127 --> 01:54:29,768
Councilor Moreau.

1477
01:54:30,628 --> 01:54:31,248
Councilor Moreau.

1478
01:54:32,698 --> 01:54:33,618
Thank you, Mr. President.

1479
01:54:33,638 --> 01:54:34,579
I don't even know who can see me.

1480
01:54:35,259 --> 01:54:40,221
I just want to thank Roberta and Danielle for coming out and for the presentation we got last week.

1481
01:54:40,641 --> 01:54:48,404
I think it's really exciting that all of these projects are focused on outdoor space, which is ever more important to us with the pandemic.

1482
01:54:48,464 --> 01:54:56,586
And I think we'll really be looking forward to in this summer and the coming summers as these projects are completed and increased access to all of these projects.

1483
01:54:56,626 --> 01:55:00,328
So I support all of them and I'm excited to move forward with them.

1484
01:55:00,388 --> 01:55:00,848
So thank you.

1485
01:55:02,213 --> 01:55:04,053
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

1486
01:55:04,414 --> 01:55:05,814
Yes, Councilor Marks.

1487
01:55:05,854 --> 01:55:06,814
Thank you, Mr. President.

1488
01:55:07,234 --> 01:55:18,617
During our last Wednesday's meeting regarding this particular, the Committee of the Whole, these particular items, there were, I believe, one or two recommendations made.

1489
01:55:18,637 --> 01:55:25,519
So I would ask that the recommendations made by the Committee of the Whole follow the approval of this paper, Mr. President.

1490
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:28,620
Thank you, Councilor.

1491
01:55:29,851 --> 01:55:32,252
Okay, so that's an amendment by Councilor Marks.

1492
01:55:34,774 --> 01:55:39,256
Okay, let's see, are there any, I see a few hands up.

1493
01:55:46,020 --> 01:55:48,502
Kelly Catano, do you want to speak about CPA funds?

1494
01:55:49,882 --> 01:55:51,643
No, sorry, sir, wrong topic.

1495
01:55:51,663 --> 01:55:52,384
Okay, no worries.

1496
01:55:56,246 --> 01:55:56,987
Jennifer Yanko.

1497
01:55:58,463 --> 01:56:01,126
CPA funds, do you have questions?

1498
01:56:04,771 --> 01:56:05,592
No, thank you.

1499
01:56:06,012 --> 01:56:09,697
I'm meant to speak on the eviction moratorium.

1500
01:56:09,777 --> 01:56:11,459
No worries, we're almost there.

1501
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:13,302
Thank you for your patience.

1502
01:56:14,751 --> 01:56:21,133
Okay, so seeing that there are no questions, no questions or comments from the council, Roberta and Danielle, thank you for all your hard work.

1503
01:56:22,053 --> 01:56:24,294
And thank you for meeting us in committee hall last week.

1504
01:56:25,114 --> 01:56:36,637
On the motion of Councilor Scarapelli to approve the paper, as amended by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Night, Clerk Hertobis, please call the roll.

1505
01:56:45,130 --> 01:56:45,670
Councilor Behrs.

1506
01:56:46,111 --> 01:56:46,371
Yes.

1507
01:56:47,011 --> 01:56:47,932
Vice president Carabiello.

1508
01:56:48,012 --> 01:56:48,312
Yes.

1509
01:56:48,752 --> 01:56:49,293
Councilor Knight.

1510
01:56:49,353 --> 01:56:49,613
Yes.

1511
01:56:49,893 --> 01:56:50,514
Councilor Marks.

1512
01:56:50,734 --> 01:56:51,074
Yes.

1513
01:56:51,374 --> 01:56:52,034
Councilor Morrell.

1514
01:56:52,615 --> 01:56:52,895
Yes.

1515
01:56:53,335 --> 01:56:54,056
Councilor Scarpelli.

1516
01:56:54,076 --> 01:56:54,196
Yes.

1517
01:56:54,736 --> 01:56:55,497
President Falco.

1518
01:56:55,997 --> 01:56:56,237
Yes.

1519
01:56:56,377 --> 01:56:58,018
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1520
01:56:58,138 --> 01:56:59,119
The motion passes.

1521
01:57:01,200 --> 01:57:02,541
Reports of committees.

1522
01:57:02,561 --> 01:57:07,585
I think that's the next item.

1523
01:57:11,023 --> 01:57:12,864
2-0-680, December 15th, 2020.

1524
01:57:13,184 --> 01:57:14,584
Committee, the whole report to follow.

1525
01:57:15,304 --> 01:57:20,786
That meeting was actually postponed due to technology problems we had last week.

1526
01:57:21,166 --> 01:57:25,247
Not because of Patrick, we had issues with the cable in the building.

1527
01:57:26,607 --> 01:57:33,329
So that there, we will reschedule that meeting at a later date.

1528
01:57:33,989 --> 01:57:35,790
President-elect Caviello.

1529
01:57:35,830 --> 01:57:36,470
Thank you, Mr. President.

1530
01:57:37,828 --> 01:57:40,490
2-0-6-8-1, December 16th, 2020.

1531
01:57:41,030 --> 01:57:45,013
Committee of the Whole report to follow that 2-0-6-8-1.

1532
01:57:45,033 --> 01:57:49,696
We had a Committee of the Whole report last Wednesday, December 16th, 2020.

1533
01:57:50,337 --> 01:57:55,600
And that was to discuss all of the CPA projects that we just voted on a couple of minutes ago.

1534
01:57:56,381 --> 01:58:00,683
There was a lot of great discussion and these are all fabulous projects for our community.

1535
01:58:01,344 --> 01:58:02,485
On the motion of councilor,

1536
01:58:03,345 --> 01:58:07,028
Vice President Caravello to approve the report, seconded by Councilor Marks.

1537
01:58:07,068 --> 01:58:08,310
Clerk Herneby, please call the roll.

1538
01:58:12,974 --> 01:58:13,634
Councilor Behrs?

1539
01:58:13,855 --> 01:58:14,075
Yes.

1540
01:58:14,575 --> 01:58:15,476
Vice President Caravello?

1541
01:58:15,516 --> 01:58:15,756
Yes.

1542
01:58:16,177 --> 01:58:16,797
Councilor Knight?

1543
01:58:16,837 --> 01:58:17,097
Yes.

1544
01:58:17,458 --> 01:58:18,078
Councilor Marks?

1545
01:58:18,359 --> 01:58:18,699
Yes.

1546
01:58:19,079 --> 01:58:19,760
Councilor Morrell?

1547
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:20,581
Yes.

1548
01:58:20,921 --> 01:58:21,661
Councilor Scarpelli?

1549
01:58:21,682 --> 01:58:21,762
Yes.

1550
01:58:22,322 --> 01:58:23,023
President Felton?

1551
01:58:23,043 --> 01:58:23,103
Yes.

1552
01:58:23,518 --> 01:58:23,738
Yes.

1553
01:58:24,298 --> 01:58:26,019
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

1554
01:58:26,099 --> 01:58:27,059
The motion passes.

1555
01:58:27,819 --> 01:58:28,959
Public participation.

1556
01:58:28,979 --> 01:58:34,841
Mr. President, before we start public participation, I'd like to make a motion to cancel next week's meeting in the interest of holiday celebrations with our families.

1557
01:58:34,921 --> 01:58:35,221
Okay.

1558
01:58:35,261 --> 01:58:40,242
On the motion of council on night to cancel the meeting next Tuesday night.

1559
01:58:40,262 --> 01:58:41,722
Second.

1560
01:58:41,982 --> 01:58:43,603
Seconded by Vice President Cardiello.

1561
01:58:43,663 --> 01:58:44,983
Clerk Hertoghez, please call the roll.

1562
01:58:46,870 --> 01:58:47,451
Councilor Behrs.

1563
01:58:47,651 --> 01:58:47,891
Yes.

1564
01:58:48,452 --> 01:58:49,353
Vice President Carabiello.

1565
01:58:49,393 --> 01:58:49,734
Yes.

1566
01:58:50,094 --> 01:58:50,635
Councilor Nights.

1567
01:58:50,655 --> 01:58:50,895
Yes.

1568
01:58:51,396 --> 01:58:51,977
Councilor Marks.

1569
01:58:52,377 --> 01:58:52,758
Yes.

1570
01:58:53,259 --> 01:58:53,919
Councilor Morrell.

1571
01:58:54,781 --> 01:58:55,021
Yes.

1572
01:58:55,862 --> 01:58:56,663
Councilor Scarpelli.

1573
01:58:56,743 --> 01:58:56,903
Yes.

1574
01:58:57,104 --> 01:58:57,865
President Falcone.

1575
01:58:57,985 --> 01:58:58,225
Yes.

1576
01:58:58,245 --> 01:59:00,689
70 affirmative, zero in the negative.

1577
01:59:00,729 --> 01:59:04,534
The motion passes and next week's meeting is canceled.

1578
01:59:07,778 --> 01:59:09,039
Okay, public participation.

1579
01:59:09,099 --> 01:59:23,191
To participate remotely outside of Zoom, anyone that would like to email us, please email our city clerk, A Herterby, that is A-H-U-R-T-U-B-I-S-E at medford-ma.gov.

1580
01:59:26,026 --> 01:59:28,810
So at this point in time, public participation.

1581
01:59:28,830 --> 01:59:30,012
So we have a few hands up.

1582
01:59:31,073 --> 01:59:35,179
Let's see, Kelly Catalo, we need your name and address for the record.

1583
01:59:35,199 --> 01:59:38,463
And I'll give you three minutes.

1584
01:59:40,362 --> 01:59:47,547
I just want to make everybody aware on this eviction thing.

1585
01:59:47,807 --> 01:59:51,009
So there is a process in housing and it's not easy.

1586
01:59:51,049 --> 01:59:57,493
There was an article last week in the Globe that I hope some people read it and caught the last paragraph.

1587
01:59:57,994 --> 02:00:01,176
In order for the landlords to be able to collect

1588
02:00:01,598 --> 02:00:05,020
the federal money, they have to issue the eviction notice.

1589
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:12,785
They do not want to evict people, but in order for them to be able to collect the arrears, they've got to be able to put something on the table.

1590
02:00:12,985 --> 02:00:14,586
Nobody's trying to put people in the street.

1591
02:00:15,007 --> 02:00:19,930
Housing Court has reached out to the realtor industry, and they are recruiting hundreds.

1592
02:00:20,410 --> 02:00:25,696
across the state in order to mediate between the tenants and the landlords.

1593
02:00:26,156 --> 02:00:35,285
So when the landlord is able to access that federal money, part of getting that money is an agreement that they're not going to evict the tenant.

1594
02:00:35,485 --> 02:00:42,132
If it's just a money issue, if it's a legal issue that they're breaking the law and they're making people unsafe, I think that's a different situation.

1595
02:00:42,992 --> 02:00:49,780
But I am on the Housing Sustainability Task Force group there and it hasn't met since last May.

1596
02:00:49,940 --> 02:00:57,749
I've been asking when are we going to meet because I'm really concerned for everyone in Medford, the tenants and the property owners.

1597
02:00:57,789 --> 02:01:03,076
We have a lot of people that can't pay their mortgages and one of the best things that the city can do is

1598
02:01:03,636 --> 02:01:05,618
is to be able to compile resources.

1599
02:01:05,838 --> 02:01:08,940
And, you know, Alicia Hunt and I have had numerous conversations.

1600
02:01:08,960 --> 02:01:10,981
She's pulled together an awful lot of stuff.

1601
02:01:11,321 --> 02:01:12,562
I've been sending her stuff.

1602
02:01:12,662 --> 02:01:14,183
Everyone wants to help each other.

1603
02:01:14,744 --> 02:01:23,470
But what I'm afraid of is, like, the state purposely backed off on extending their eviction moratorium because of the federal one that was put out.

1604
02:01:23,570 --> 02:01:26,132
And the federal government did extend today.

1605
02:01:26,672 --> 02:01:29,553
they extended theirs until the end of January.

1606
02:01:30,073 --> 02:01:42,475
So I feel like if, as a city, we start getting involved in that and start making these home rules, it's actually gonna hurt our property owners that they're not going to be able to access the funds, because at the end of the day, they still need to pay their mortgage.

1607
02:01:42,555 --> 02:01:44,735
Nobody really wants to put anybody in the street.

1608
02:01:45,195 --> 02:01:53,057
And a lot of our landlords in Medford, they're elderly people, and they're relying on the rent in order to actually live and buy their food.

1609
02:01:53,537 --> 02:01:58,479
So it's important that we can keep the resources there for everybody, the tenants and the landlords.

1610
02:01:58,939 --> 02:02:03,581
And I don't think that we're helping everybody if the city steps in and puts an eviction moratorium.

1611
02:02:04,362 --> 02:02:04,782
Thank you.

1612
02:02:04,802 --> 02:02:06,082
Thank you very much.

1613
02:02:06,382 --> 02:02:07,743
Mr. President, just point of information.

1614
02:02:08,104 --> 02:02:09,565
Point of information, Councilor Behrs.

1615
02:02:09,825 --> 02:02:10,686
Thanks, Mr. President.

1616
02:02:11,026 --> 02:02:17,231
Yeah, how this would work is it wouldn't actually prevent notices from being filed in court.

1617
02:02:17,251 --> 02:02:23,495
It would just prevent the end of the process, the removal, and the federal eviction moratorium is partial.

1618
02:02:23,556 --> 02:02:27,238
It doesn't actually apply to a vast majority of households.

1619
02:02:27,518 --> 02:02:27,879
Thank you.

1620
02:02:29,960 --> 02:02:31,201
Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

1621
02:02:31,321 --> 02:02:34,103
Okay, up next we have Jennifer Yanko.

1622
02:02:34,864 --> 02:02:37,286
Jennifer, name and address for the record, and you have three minutes.

1623
02:02:38,324 --> 02:02:40,086
Okay, my name is Jennifer Yankel.

1624
02:02:40,146 --> 02:02:43,070
I live at 16 Monument Street in Medford.

1625
02:02:43,911 --> 02:02:53,382
And I would like to read on behalf of the NAACP a letter that we have prepared for leaders of Malden, Medford, Arlington, Everett, and Winchester.

1626
02:02:55,057 --> 02:02:58,819
And I'm doing this as a member of the executive committee of the NAACP.

1627
02:02:59,160 --> 02:03:03,382
Dear elected leaders of Malden, Medford, Arlington, Everett and Winchester.

1628
02:03:03,783 --> 02:03:15,971
The Mystic Valley area branch of the NAACP includes community members from each of your cities, including Medford, and is in full support of the eviction moratorium enacted by Malden's leadership.

1629
02:03:16,691 --> 02:03:21,114
This policy is an exemplary response to the COVID-19 state of emergency.

1630
02:03:22,343 --> 02:03:27,806
In order to protect our communities, people must have the option to remain safely housed.

1631
02:03:28,866 --> 02:03:31,687
The need to prevent homelessness has never been greater.

1632
02:03:32,828 --> 02:03:41,812
Members of our organization see the eviction moratorium as an essential public health measure to be taken in the interest of everyone's safety.

1633
02:03:42,891 --> 02:03:59,355
We urge Medford, Arlington, Everett, and Winchester to adopt a policy similar to that of Malden so that communities in the Mystic Valley area can live through this winter knowing they will not be forcefully removed from their homes in this time of great hardship.

1634
02:04:01,916 --> 02:04:11,898
The Mystic Valley area branch of the NAACP commends Malden's courageous and compassionate steps taken to protect the most vulnerable members of their community.

1635
02:04:12,749 --> 02:04:15,931
And we hope that other member cities will follow suit.

1636
02:04:16,771 --> 02:04:25,676
We include here a template for others to enact similar policies to protect our communities during this time of hardship, suffering, sickness, and death.

1637
02:04:26,976 --> 02:04:34,580
The letter is signed in resolute partnership by Zane T. Crute, the president of the Mystic Valley Area Branch of the NAACP.

1638
02:04:35,041 --> 02:04:39,063
And we have included this template based on the Malden

1639
02:04:41,731 --> 02:04:42,171
policy.

1640
02:04:42,331 --> 02:04:42,712
Thank you.

1641
02:04:42,992 --> 02:04:43,712
Thank you very much.

1642
02:04:43,732 --> 02:04:50,997
Okay, we have Mary Stathos.

1643
02:04:51,637 --> 02:04:53,919
Mary, name and address for the record, Mary.

1644
02:04:55,060 --> 02:04:57,821
Mary Stathos, 63 Felsway West in Medford.

1645
02:04:59,462 --> 02:05:00,163
You have three minutes.

1646
02:05:00,963 --> 02:05:01,244
Great.

1647
02:05:01,424 --> 02:05:01,744
Thank you.

1648
02:05:03,065 --> 02:05:04,426
So my name is Mary Stathos.

1649
02:05:04,486 --> 02:05:10,810
I'm here on behalf of the Alpha Tenant Union and I'm a resident of one of the Alpha buildings on Felsway West in Medford.

1650
02:05:11,877 --> 02:05:16,778
I came to speak in support of the resolution to create a city-level eviction moratorium in Medford.

1651
02:05:17,058 --> 02:05:28,461
Just two weeks ago, Alpha Management attempted to evict another member of the tenant union and a resident of our building for an eviction that was finalized in February with a 48-hour eviction notice, despite her multiple attempts at getting aid from the city.

1652
02:05:28,481 --> 02:05:34,102
Due to the noncompliance of Alpha Management to accept this aid from outside resources, they followed through with the eviction.

1653
02:05:37,050 --> 02:05:38,130
They followed through with the eviction.

1654
02:05:38,271 --> 02:05:41,232
This left her with nowhere to go and very few resources available to her.

1655
02:05:41,792 --> 02:05:51,777
Due to the help of the Alpha Tenant Union as well as Greater Boston Legal Services, we were able to enact the CDC moratorium that, as of right now, is still ending at the end of December.

1656
02:05:52,837 --> 02:05:59,243
We are still in the middle of a pandemic and forcing individuals out of their homes is not only unfair and unjust, but dangerous to the spread of COVID-19.

1657
02:05:59,684 --> 02:06:07,631
I believe that housing is a right and that we should not be enforcing evictions for non-payment of rent during a time where so many people are out of work or unable to work due to the impacts of COVID.

1658
02:06:08,712 --> 02:06:15,979
to be able to stay in their home or move to an alternative, safe place to live.

1659
02:06:16,439 --> 02:06:25,968
While we should never force people into homelessness due to unforeseen financial circumstances, it is of the utmost importance that we do not do this in the midst of a pandemic.

1660
02:06:26,448 --> 02:06:30,492
This is why I urge the Council to create an eviction moratorium on the city level, like cities in the United States and around the world.

1661
02:06:31,377 --> 02:06:33,118
as cities like Malden have recently done.

1662
02:06:33,138 --> 02:06:41,425
As it was stated earlier in the meeting, people cannot access aid when they're not able to stay in their homes, and also when landlords are not responding to attempts to utilize this aid.

1663
02:06:41,625 --> 02:06:41,985
Thank you.

1664
02:06:42,426 --> 02:06:42,766
Thank you.

1665
02:06:42,786 --> 02:06:45,969
Okay, let's see.

1666
02:06:47,049 --> 02:06:49,071
Kit Collins, name and address for the record.

1667
02:06:49,091 --> 02:06:49,892
You have three minutes.

1668
02:06:51,673 --> 02:06:52,974
Hi, Kit Collins.

1669
02:06:53,194 --> 02:06:55,316
I live at 42 Williams Street in Medford.

1670
02:06:56,675 --> 02:07:12,165
And I won't repeat what other people have said about the reasons why an eviction moratorium would add to and not simply duplicate resources that are already available, because in things that a moratorium can do, the existing resources don't or cannot.

1671
02:07:13,066 --> 02:07:25,134
But I also want to flag something that I think Councilor Beers phrased really well earlier, just to highlight that this is an emergency and being in an emergency calls for acting

1672
02:07:26,052 --> 02:07:27,973
like you're in an emergency.

1673
02:07:28,794 --> 02:07:31,815
It calls for bold action, doing things that you wouldn't do otherwise.

1674
02:07:32,656 --> 02:07:46,824
And while housing insecurity and people being thrown out of their homes should always be treated as an emergency, particularly in the middle of a worsening pandemic, particularly right at the outset of the winter, this does not call for a business as usual approach.

1675
02:07:46,864 --> 02:07:51,646
This calls for going above and beyond how we would ordinarily react to circumstances.

1676
02:07:52,447 --> 02:07:54,048
I also just want to say that

1677
02:07:54,945 --> 02:08:08,887
I think that there's, I see this framing of the issue as the tension between renters and landlords being some sort of zero-sum or not a zero-sum game, really being diversionary.

1678
02:08:09,107 --> 02:08:14,668
That's really not the case, and this isn't a battle between the interests of tenants and landlords.

1679
02:08:16,029 --> 02:08:21,550
And it does nobody any service at all to think that it's pitting the interests of one against the other.

1680
02:08:21,570 --> 02:08:23,730
So again, especially since,

1681
02:08:24,200 --> 02:08:30,765
this resolution, which, unfortunately, that table was just to recommend bold actions, I believe, to the mayor's office.

1682
02:08:31,725 --> 02:08:35,528
Me and I think many other members of the community still stand very strongly for that.

1683
02:08:36,168 --> 02:08:43,013
We really need the city to take bold action on this, or we're gonna see a lot of tragedies unfold across our city.

1684
02:08:43,073 --> 02:08:49,558
And I don't think any of us want to see Medford being a place where those types of tragedies are allowed to occur.

1685
02:08:50,638 --> 02:08:50,879
Thank you.

1686
02:08:53,847 --> 02:08:56,989
OK, we have Zachary Mabin.

1687
02:08:58,310 --> 02:08:59,491
Name and address for the record, please.

1688
02:08:59,511 --> 02:09:00,192
You have three minutes.

1689
02:09:01,913 --> 02:09:02,233
Thank you.

1690
02:09:02,394 --> 02:09:03,314
My name is Zachary Mabin.

1691
02:09:03,414 --> 02:09:06,217
My address is 159 Alston Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

1692
02:09:07,978 --> 02:09:10,320
I would like to reiterate all those points that were just made.

1693
02:09:12,523 --> 02:09:19,484
I am in support of the resolution for an eviction moratorium.

1694
02:09:20,564 --> 02:09:23,485
And so I don't have any prepared notes.

1695
02:09:24,505 --> 02:09:34,327
But I just want to add my voice among many to the discussion that this is an emergent issue.

1696
02:09:35,287 --> 02:09:39,648
This is an issue that is going to cost lives, in addition to

1697
02:09:42,511 --> 02:09:47,554
the additional strain in resources that evictions will cause down the line.

1698
02:09:49,074 --> 02:09:55,318
I totally understand that mortgages, taxes, these will need to be paid.

1699
02:09:55,818 --> 02:10:06,183
But the key difference is the urgency that is facing tenants who are being threatened or being attempted to be evicted.

1700
02:10:06,804 --> 02:10:09,685
So with that, simply, I'd like to turn it over.

1701
02:10:09,845 --> 02:10:10,085
Thank you.

1702
02:10:10,806 --> 02:10:11,086
Thank you.

1703
02:10:13,105 --> 02:10:14,506
Point of information, Councilor Marks.

1704
02:10:15,087 --> 02:10:16,087
Thank you, Mr. President.

1705
02:10:16,248 --> 02:10:21,192
And I agree with a lot of the speakers that this is an emergency issue.

1706
02:10:21,832 --> 02:10:27,377
And this particular resolution is asking for the administration to act.

1707
02:10:27,917 --> 02:10:38,947
So I think people should be picking up the phone, sending emails, contacting the mayor's office, because this seems like a roundabout way to get something done that's an emergency.

1708
02:10:39,507 --> 02:10:46,870
So I would urge people, like I'll do tomorrow, pick up the phone and call the administration, Mr. President, and have them implement it, Mr. President.

1709
02:10:47,350 --> 02:10:48,190
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1710
02:10:48,410 --> 02:10:49,191
Point of information.

1711
02:10:49,631 --> 02:10:51,392
Point of information, Councilor Beers.

1712
02:10:51,512 --> 02:10:53,052
I agree with Councilor Marks completely.

1713
02:10:53,112 --> 02:10:57,354
I've actually been calling the administration on this regularly for the past nine months.

1714
02:10:58,394 --> 02:11:05,757
And I think the intent of the resolution that was ruled out of order was that we would add our voices to that chorus of folks who are putting pressure on the administration.

1715
02:11:06,217 --> 02:11:07,818
You know, the mechanism that would be used here

1716
02:11:08,411 --> 02:11:11,915
delegated to the executive and the Board of Health through Mass General Law.

1717
02:11:11,995 --> 02:11:17,581
So, you know, it's not actually something that we as a council can do, which is what was the intent.

1718
02:11:18,001 --> 02:11:18,302
Thank you.

1719
02:11:18,837 --> 02:11:19,197
Thank you.

1720
02:11:19,618 --> 02:11:20,919
Point of information, Mr. President.

1721
02:11:20,939 --> 02:11:22,681
Point of information, Councilor Marks.

1722
02:11:22,841 --> 02:11:27,845
So a very similar paper has been in subcommittee for eight months, Mr. President.

1723
02:11:27,865 --> 02:11:28,346
You are correct.

1724
02:11:28,766 --> 02:11:29,407
Eight months.

1725
02:11:30,007 --> 02:11:34,091
The moratorium ended, I believe, on October 18th in Massachusetts.

1726
02:11:34,591 --> 02:11:38,175
I may be off on that, but I thought I read on October 18th.

1727
02:11:38,515 --> 02:11:42,459
So it's been two months, Mr. President, that the subcommittee could have met.

1728
02:11:42,779 --> 02:11:42,919
Correct.

1729
02:11:42,939 --> 02:11:43,279
Two months.

1730
02:11:43,299 --> 02:11:43,880
You are correct.

1731
02:11:44,060 --> 02:11:51,289
We met when the paper was sent to subcommittee on April 7th, and we met on subcommittee two weeks later.

1732
02:11:51,670 --> 02:11:53,632
That's how quickly it happened, Mr. President.

1733
02:11:53,832 --> 02:11:55,374
We met on April 22nd.

1734
02:11:55,935 --> 02:12:01,782
So if this was an emergency, Mr. President, on October 18th, we should have had a meeting the following week.

1735
02:12:02,597 --> 02:12:03,037
I would agree.

1736
02:12:03,178 --> 02:12:04,999
To go over the paper that was in subcommittee.

1737
02:12:05,720 --> 02:12:12,827
I'm not saying it's not an emergency, Mr. President, but I just think this is a real roundabout way of getting something done.

1738
02:12:13,388 --> 02:12:17,171
And if people truly want to get something done, then let's act, Mr. President.

1739
02:12:17,211 --> 02:12:22,076
As I mentioned earlier, we got the housing stability hotline that we mentioned eight months ago.

1740
02:12:22,997 --> 02:12:25,758
Eight months ago, that would be a real use in this community.

1741
02:12:26,458 --> 02:12:29,980
We mentioned about the Housing Stability Task Force, another real use.

1742
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:34,402
And we heard from one of the speakers that hasn't met since May, Mr. President.

1743
02:12:34,782 --> 02:12:38,964
So we're missing a lot of opportunity to move forward on items, Mr. President.

1744
02:12:39,224 --> 02:12:42,705
And I think some people are spinning their wheels in the wrong direction.

1745
02:12:43,145 --> 02:12:46,267
So I'm more than happy, Mr. President, to move issues forward.

1746
02:12:46,707 --> 02:12:49,068
But we have to do it in a way that makes sense, Mr. President.

1747
02:12:49,488 --> 02:12:49,829
Thank you.

1748
02:12:49,989 --> 02:12:53,913
Mr. President, just a point of information.

1749
02:12:54,113 --> 02:12:58,619
We did act on October 13th, asking the state to reinstate the moratorium.

1750
02:12:58,959 --> 02:13:00,341
So we did take action then.

1751
02:13:01,001 --> 02:13:07,689
And I would be glad if my counselors are available to meet at the earliest opportunity next week, if they're available.

1752
02:13:08,830 --> 02:13:09,271
I haven't heard.

1753
02:13:11,611 --> 02:13:15,173
Like I said before, I would encourage you to set up a- It's been eight months, Mr. President.

1754
02:13:15,533 --> 02:13:16,013
Eight months.

1755
02:13:16,413 --> 02:13:26,339
So if we want to look to see where maybe something didn't get followed through, it's with that paper and those issues that were before the subcommittee, Mr. President.

1756
02:13:26,659 --> 02:13:31,522
Because even if the moratorium was on place, you could still work at some point, it's going to end.

1757
02:13:31,802 --> 02:13:34,563
And you could still work to that end point, Mr. President.

1758
02:13:34,983 --> 02:13:35,784
And that didn't happen.

1759
02:13:36,064 --> 02:13:39,085
There was no planning, no follow-up meetings, Mr. President.

1760
02:13:39,625 --> 02:13:41,586
And maybe that's where the ball was dropped.

1761
02:13:41,686 --> 02:13:51,489
Well, actually, I think, Councilor Marks, I've been following up, trying to get responses to the resolutions that we put forward so that we could have another meeting.

1762
02:13:51,529 --> 02:13:52,589
They haven't been forthcoming.

1763
02:13:52,749 --> 02:13:55,010
I'd be happy to have another meeting at the earliest opportunity.

1764
02:13:55,310 --> 02:14:00,812
Well, you should have been yelling from the highest mountain if that hasn't happened in eight months, because this is an emergency.

1765
02:14:01,568 --> 02:14:02,609
Mr. Chairman.

1766
02:14:02,929 --> 02:14:05,831
Mr. President, I work with homeless families on a daily basis.

1767
02:14:05,851 --> 02:14:06,331
I know you do.

1768
02:14:06,411 --> 02:14:11,615
On a daily basis, trying to get homeless families and homeless individuals into permanent housing.

1769
02:14:12,555 --> 02:14:13,776
So I know what the need is.

1770
02:14:13,836 --> 02:14:15,738
I know what the demand is, Mr. President.

1771
02:14:16,838 --> 02:14:18,499
So I see it on a daily basis.

1772
02:14:19,760 --> 02:14:24,884
If this is an emergency, we should have acted over the last eight months, Mr. President, and it is an emergency.

1773
02:14:25,727 --> 02:14:26,007
Thank you.

1774
02:14:26,408 --> 02:14:31,452
Councilor Behrs, like I said before, I would encourage you to set up that subcommittee meeting as soon as possible.

1775
02:14:31,552 --> 02:14:35,335
And I think that hopefully you can make some progress and move forward.

1776
02:14:35,375 --> 02:14:37,016
I think everybody wants to move forward on this.

1777
02:14:37,276 --> 02:14:46,063
I just would say, I think the legislative record and the items put forward reflect that at multiple points, not only has the council had resolutions before it, but has taken action.

1778
02:14:46,323 --> 02:14:48,765
So I just want to make that point.

1779
02:14:49,446 --> 02:14:49,686
Okay.

1780
02:14:49,726 --> 02:14:51,607
We have a number of residents that like to speak.

1781
02:14:51,647 --> 02:14:52,208
We have, um,

1782
02:14:54,988 --> 02:14:58,590
Thane H. Name and address for the record, please.

1783
02:14:59,850 --> 02:15:00,250
Oh yeah.

1784
02:15:00,291 --> 02:15:01,251
My name is Thane Hill.

1785
02:15:01,291 --> 02:15:04,232
I live at 14 New Bern Avenue in South Medford.

1786
02:15:06,093 --> 02:15:17,879
I can't speak to all the procedural worries, but I can speak from someone who organizes with tenants and knows people.

1787
02:15:18,681 --> 02:15:21,403
who have been evicted and who have gotten notices to quit.

1788
02:15:21,824 --> 02:15:35,455
And I want to just speak to the fact that while we're talking about the urgency, there's also been people raising the concern of homeowners, of landlords.

1789
02:15:36,056 --> 02:15:44,162
And I think if we're going to have a just and equal system here, we have to look after the people most in need first.

1790
02:15:44,302 --> 02:15:44,603
And that is,

1791
02:15:45,957 --> 02:15:49,018
in this case, the tenants, those people who are being evicted.

1792
02:15:50,858 --> 02:16:05,381
In my opinion, the crucial difference between the worries of someone with a mortgage and someone with the worries of being evicted immediately is that they'll lose their homes and it's devastating.

1793
02:16:05,641 --> 02:16:14,503
And I don't think people really are speaking to that just from my experience, especially like I can't speak to all the procedural

1794
02:16:16,805 --> 02:16:21,907
like how that, how it has to go to vote, but I think it really is urgent.

1795
02:16:21,967 --> 02:16:24,068
And I think I want people to keep pushing that.

1796
02:16:24,188 --> 02:16:30,310
So I would urge that the city council does resolve.

1797
02:16:31,631 --> 02:16:39,414
Sorry, I don't know the specific terminology, but urges the city administration to have an eviction moratorium.

1798
02:16:39,814 --> 02:16:40,534
I think it's crucial.

1799
02:16:42,335 --> 02:16:42,995
Thank you very much.

1800
02:16:45,033 --> 02:16:45,613
Steve Schnapp.

1801
02:16:46,233 --> 02:16:47,834
Steve, name and address for the record, please.

1802
02:16:49,594 --> 02:16:50,694
My name is Steve Schnapp.

1803
02:16:50,754 --> 02:16:53,855
I live at 36 Hillside Ave in Medford Square.

1804
02:16:54,275 --> 02:16:55,155
I'm a homeowner.

1805
02:16:56,875 --> 02:16:58,695
I support this eviction moratorium.

1806
02:16:58,775 --> 02:17:04,036
I actually have a question, Mr. President, for you, the council, or anyone else who can answer it.

1807
02:17:04,577 --> 02:17:12,398
How many families or individuals have been evicted since the pandemic began in Medford?

1808
02:17:14,385 --> 02:17:15,986
Does anyone have that number in front of them?

1809
02:17:16,446 --> 02:17:16,906
I do not.

1810
02:17:18,926 --> 02:17:21,147
I am personally aware of 12 ongoing cases.

1811
02:17:21,167 --> 02:17:24,428
I have been trying to get that information, but have been unsuccessful.

1812
02:17:24,968 --> 02:17:27,609
Okay, so you have not, Councilor Villescaz, I apologize.

1813
02:17:27,689 --> 02:17:29,269
With the heater on, I can't hear you.

1814
02:17:29,369 --> 02:17:31,950
I said that I'm personally aware of about a dozen cases.

1815
02:17:32,030 --> 02:17:41,153
I've been trying to get the specific information for weeks and have, you know, I've been looking through various datas to try to get a specific number, but have not been successful.

1816
02:17:42,559 --> 02:17:49,303
So even with a moratorium during that period, 12 families have been evicted.

1817
02:17:51,145 --> 02:17:52,346
Ongoing cases, Steve.

1818
02:17:53,246 --> 02:17:55,288
I don't know that they've actually been removed from their homes.

1819
02:17:56,368 --> 02:17:58,230
But they're under the threat of eviction.

1820
02:17:58,986 --> 02:18:06,130
And I think, Mr. President, that this is a situation that demands action.

1821
02:18:06,910 --> 02:18:08,431
And we all agree with you.

1822
02:18:08,631 --> 02:18:13,093
I'm hoping that the council will take action at the soonest possible moment.

1823
02:18:13,133 --> 02:18:13,594
Thank you.

1824
02:18:14,374 --> 02:18:15,555
We're all in agreement.

1825
02:18:15,715 --> 02:18:16,855
Thank you, Mr. Schnapp.

1826
02:18:16,875 --> 02:18:17,316
Thank you.

1827
02:18:17,476 --> 02:18:18,436
We are all in agreement.

1828
02:18:18,476 --> 02:18:20,917
This is something that needs to be dealt with immediately.

1829
02:18:22,398 --> 02:18:22,718
Thank you.

1830
02:18:23,839 --> 02:18:26,100
Let's see, we have Diane Sullivan.

1831
02:18:26,140 --> 02:18:27,401
Name and address for the record, Diane.

1832
02:18:28,201 --> 02:18:28,921
You have three minutes.

1833
02:18:30,662 --> 02:18:31,422
Hi, thank you.

1834
02:18:31,602 --> 02:18:33,902
Diane Sullivan, Jerome Street, West Medford.

1835
02:18:34,702 --> 02:18:37,043
Just want to, you know, sort of shout out in support.

1836
02:18:37,223 --> 02:18:44,705
And I think, you know, it's great to know that we're all in agreeance that this is an emergency and demands our immediate attention.

1837
02:18:46,345 --> 02:18:51,286
Understanding, you know, the sort of, I guess, pushback on the procedure.

1838
02:18:51,886 --> 02:18:54,787
Okay, like let's get onto these next steps, right?

1839
02:18:55,907 --> 02:19:03,870
But I do want to really just echo something that Kit Collins referred to around the narrative.

1840
02:19:04,811 --> 02:19:12,714
And I think, you know, we all know that Medford has been identified as a, you know, an unwelcoming community in terms of a rental market, right?

1841
02:19:12,754 --> 02:19:22,678
We have the study from Suffolk that shows this, and it's also, you know, it will be, it's been demonstrated in the work around the housing production plan.

1842
02:19:23,878 --> 02:19:27,941
So I just feel strongly that we need to make a statement as a community.

1843
02:19:28,781 --> 02:19:31,023
And I understand this rests with the administration.

1844
02:19:31,063 --> 02:19:35,025
And then I think counselors, you know, your community is hearing you.

1845
02:19:35,045 --> 02:19:38,447
There's never a bad time to have this conversation in a crisis.

1846
02:19:38,487 --> 02:19:39,528
So I appreciate that.

1847
02:19:40,348 --> 02:19:45,071
We, you know, we as a community have been given the grace of A, the education, right?

1848
02:19:45,572 --> 02:19:47,073
You know, and how to best engage.

1849
02:19:49,009 --> 02:19:59,976
and B, just the fact that we have the space to have this conversation, because this crisis, while it's happening right now, it's going to continue to happen and there will be a lag effect.

1850
02:20:00,056 --> 02:20:06,640
So even as some folks in the economy start to see a turnaround, hopefully there are others who will be left behind.

1851
02:20:06,700 --> 02:20:11,023
And we know that disproportionately in terms of poverty and impacts of hunger and homelessness,

1852
02:20:11,903 --> 02:20:16,608
that burden falls largely, very disproportionately on communities of color.

1853
02:20:17,288 --> 02:20:18,829
So we really need to acknowledge that.

1854
02:20:18,930 --> 02:20:26,777
So I guess I'm saying all of this to say that we've got resources and we've got intent and we need to match all of this.

1855
02:20:27,918 --> 02:20:36,925
I've done eviction prevention work, being in the courthouses and negotiating with tenants and landlords where when we walk away from the situation, it's a win-win.

1856
02:20:37,285 --> 02:20:46,253
And it's a win for the city because we maintain that economic sort of addition to the local economy that rentals can bring.

1857
02:20:46,333 --> 02:20:49,856
So, I appreciate the opportunity to have this discussion.

1858
02:20:50,456 --> 02:20:56,500
I appreciate what the counselors are saying around procedure, but it's, you know, we all recognize it's time to work.

1859
02:20:56,560 --> 02:21:03,485
So I think I'm most encouraged by hearing in the affirmation that this is an emergency and we all have a role to play.

1860
02:21:03,605 --> 02:21:06,827
So I appreciate your time and consideration.

1861
02:21:07,387 --> 02:21:07,967
Thank you, Diane.

1862
02:21:09,809 --> 02:21:12,550
Let's see, we have Jess Farrell, name and address for the record.

1863
02:21:12,570 --> 02:21:13,351
You have three minutes.

1864
02:21:15,692 --> 02:21:17,714
Hi, Jess Farrell, 29 Martin Street.

1865
02:21:18,817 --> 02:21:35,269
Um, yes, I support the eviction moratorium, and I just wanted to say that there are studies out there that show that communities who let their moratoriums lapse actually have higher mortality rates and all kinds of things during COVID.

1866
02:21:35,329 --> 02:21:43,354
So I'm sure that you've all looked into that sort of science and the research that's been done, so I won't belabor it too much.

1867
02:21:43,634 --> 02:21:46,536
But I just wanted to state my

1868
02:21:48,013 --> 02:21:48,913
my support for this.

1869
02:21:49,513 --> 02:21:58,096
Also in just a few hours, a petition has been circulated to support this moratorium and it's gotten over a hundred signatures.

1870
02:21:58,196 --> 02:22:06,939
So I think the community is like really behind this and would like to see the Medford City Government lead on this as soon as possible.

1871
02:22:07,279 --> 02:22:07,599
Thank you.

1872
02:22:07,939 --> 02:22:08,919
Thank you very much, Jess.

1873
02:22:09,580 --> 02:22:10,120
Mr. President.

1874
02:22:13,941 --> 02:22:15,221
Mr. President, if I could, sorry.

1875
02:22:15,982 --> 02:22:17,102
Oh, Councilor Morrell, I apologize.

1876
02:22:18,463 --> 02:22:26,447
Okay, I just wanted to share, to address Mr. Schnapp's question, I did have someone just send me a tableau visualization.

1877
02:22:26,487 --> 02:22:32,190
And the note is that there are currently 50 court cases in Medford related to non-payment of rent.

1878
02:22:34,931 --> 02:22:37,112
To address that request for that number.

1879
02:22:38,893 --> 02:22:39,594
Thank you very much.

1880
02:22:39,614 --> 02:22:40,614
Thank you.

1881
02:22:45,016 --> 02:22:45,196
Okay.

1882
02:22:45,216 --> 02:22:47,558
Let's see.

1883
02:22:49,295 --> 02:22:52,078
Antoinette Hugley.

1884
02:22:52,118 --> 02:22:53,339
Name and address for the record, please.

1885
02:22:53,359 --> 02:22:53,999
You have three minutes.

1886
02:22:55,340 --> 02:22:57,742
Hi, my name is Antoinette Hugley.

1887
02:22:57,842 --> 02:23:02,266
I currently reside at 53 Felsway West, the Alpha Management Apartments.

1888
02:23:03,767 --> 02:23:13,495
I am wanting to, well, actually I wanted to speak out because I was one of those people who were faced with a 48 hour eviction this month.

1889
02:23:13,736 --> 02:23:17,279
I was able to fight that due to the CDC being in place.

1890
02:23:18,190 --> 02:23:29,356
I can tell you that without that, I would have been homeless and basically, you know, financial support or organizations are put in place.

1891
02:23:30,954 --> 02:23:43,577
with my situation, it would kind of be hard for me to even accept or even take advantage of that due to me even having court on the 30th of this month.

1892
02:23:43,977 --> 02:23:50,899
So I'm definitely in agreeance with the CDC, I'm sorry, with the eviction moratorium being in place.

1893
02:23:51,839 --> 02:23:58,401
And I just wanted to express the situation that I'm currently going through.

1894
02:24:00,178 --> 02:24:03,782
So that would be a big help to me in that situation.

1895
02:24:06,285 --> 02:24:06,665
Thank you.

1896
02:24:07,606 --> 02:24:07,946
Thank you.

1897
02:24:10,449 --> 02:24:13,472
We have Doug McKeon, name and address of the record.

1898
02:24:13,492 --> 02:24:14,393
You have three minutes, Doug.

1899
02:24:14,413 --> 02:24:18,478
My address is 136 Summer Street, Medford.

1900
02:24:22,294 --> 02:24:25,157
All right, so I'm in support of the eviction moratorium.

1901
02:24:25,637 --> 02:24:29,801
Thane Hale, Mary Stathos have talked to various reasons why.

1902
02:24:30,361 --> 02:24:33,144
I would like to share my personal experience during the pandemic.

1903
02:24:33,704 --> 02:24:36,727
I'm a massage therapist who's been unemployed since March.

1904
02:24:37,428 --> 02:24:39,029
I'm six months behind on back rent.

1905
02:24:39,570 --> 02:24:43,974
I can't work because my housemates have comorbidities, and I frankly don't want them to die.

1906
02:24:44,534 --> 02:24:48,438
I don't qualify for IRMA, RAFT, or ABCD because household hold a,

1907
02:24:49,662 --> 02:24:51,983
The household income exceeds requirements.

1908
02:24:52,903 --> 02:25:00,145
Earlier this month, I got shots of a bone marrow stimulant for a week to sell my bodily fluids for 1K.

1909
02:25:00,845 --> 02:25:02,246
That is how I've been making ends meet.

1910
02:25:02,926 --> 02:25:04,366
And I'm still one of the lucky ones.

1911
02:25:05,087 --> 02:25:09,468
I have three gainfully employed roommates, and my landlord is not insane enough to raise my rent.

1912
02:25:10,148 --> 02:25:14,269
If any of these support structures fail, kidneys and livers run for $150,000, which I know for no reason.

1913
02:25:17,672 --> 02:25:19,112
The federal government is a circus.

1914
02:25:19,392 --> 02:25:20,193
Baker is a joke.

1915
02:25:20,233 --> 02:25:23,233
The state played on itself and a blade is hanging above my head.

1916
02:25:23,633 --> 02:25:28,454
Please have mercy on the community and the people who are worse off than I am.

1917
02:25:28,854 --> 02:25:29,855
I yield my time.

1918
02:25:31,235 --> 02:25:31,715
Thank you, Doug.

1919
02:25:34,296 --> 02:25:35,256
Okay.

1920
02:25:36,336 --> 02:25:37,456
Would anybody else like to speak?

1921
02:25:37,936 --> 02:25:41,417
Oh, let's see, Matt.

1922
02:25:41,857 --> 02:25:43,537
Matt, name and address for the record, please.

1923
02:25:45,058 --> 02:25:45,998
You have three minutes, Matthew.

1924
02:25:47,332 --> 02:25:49,113
John, you know, I think I actually have 10 minutes.

1925
02:25:49,133 --> 02:25:50,714
That's what the rule says, just like everybody else.

1926
02:25:50,794 --> 02:25:57,678
If you want to change the rules, I think you need a super majority, which would be five to seven votes of the council during the meeting to temporarily change the rules.

1927
02:25:58,379 --> 02:26:07,985
But anyway, I would like to know if you have the language of the bill that's currently in a subcommittee, the one that conflicts with this one.

1928
02:26:08,565 --> 02:26:11,767
It's basically almost the same thing that was mentioned tonight.

1929
02:26:13,137 --> 02:26:18,059
Okay, so this has been an issue that's come up previously about what exactly the council is doing.

1930
02:26:18,119 --> 02:26:25,481
If it's only calling on the mayor to take a position or if it's actually believes that it has the authority to actually pass some legislation.

1931
02:26:26,722 --> 02:26:35,185
Is it the case that what we're discussing and what's actually in the subcommittee is just a shared resolution, just making a recommendation upon the mayor?

1932
02:26:37,137 --> 02:26:47,393
It's a recommendation being resolved by the Memphis City Council that the city administration implement an eviction and moratorium to protect Memphis residents during the severe COVID-19 surge this winter.

1933
02:26:48,379 --> 02:26:52,200
Yeah, I've read it, but I'm asking concretely, concretely, what is this calling for?

1934
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:58,801
Because it was something that was discussed previously in this meeting is this idea that the mayor needs to be lobbied harder by residents.

1935
02:26:59,421 --> 02:27:04,022
So, and that, you know, Councilor Behrs has said that he's made many, many calls to the mayor's office.

1936
02:27:04,902 --> 02:27:08,023
So concretely, concretely, what is this calling for?

1937
02:27:08,063 --> 02:27:16,605
Is it just calling upon the mayor to make a decree or does this council believe that it can vote and have a moratorium on subcommittee?

1938
02:27:17,105 --> 02:27:23,730
the Massachusetts general law delegates authority around this matter to the board of health and the mayor's office.

1939
02:27:25,151 --> 02:27:25,371
Okay.

1940
02:27:25,391 --> 02:27:28,133
So this, this resolution is just urgent.

1941
02:27:28,593 --> 02:27:28,873
Yeah.

1942
02:27:28,933 --> 02:27:29,414
I'm sorry.

1943
02:27:29,554 --> 02:27:31,575
Is that council bears did confirm.

1944
02:27:31,595 --> 02:27:35,778
This is just calling on the council in this point of emergency.

1945
02:27:35,798 --> 02:27:38,220
So we agree, we agree.

1946
02:27:38,320 --> 02:27:41,802
And we're asking for the mayor to put a moratorium as soon as possible.

1947
02:27:41,822 --> 02:27:42,423
Is that correct?

1948
02:27:44,484 --> 02:27:45,385
That was my intent.

1949
02:27:46,412 --> 02:27:50,318
Okay, and so you're saying that it's in the subcommittee, right?

1950
02:27:50,618 --> 02:27:50,919
And so...

1951
02:27:52,038 --> 02:28:04,184
basically, you know, this, this council that may say that something's stuck in subcommittee or there's a problem with scheduling, but every single one of these counselors can say, I pledge, I pledge to try to organize that meeting as soon as possible.

1952
02:28:04,544 --> 02:28:09,006
I pledge to not create drama about this and, you know, pettiness and posturing.

1953
02:28:09,327 --> 02:28:13,028
And I promise that I will vote on this resolution in subcommittee.

1954
02:28:13,048 --> 02:28:13,529
Is that correct?

1955
02:28:13,909 --> 02:28:17,331
I promise that once this gets out of subcommittee, I will vote in support of it.

1956
02:28:17,351 --> 02:28:17,831
Is that correct?

1957
02:28:20,692 --> 02:28:25,433
Is that within the councilor's, is that within councilor's ability this evening to make that kind of a pledge?

1958
02:28:27,554 --> 02:28:29,894
Basically, the paper's in subcommittee.

1959
02:28:30,374 --> 02:28:37,816
The council has to schedule a meeting to actually move it out of subcommittee, which from what it sounds like, it's- That's all correct.

1960
02:28:37,836 --> 02:28:38,656
That's all been covered.

1961
02:28:38,796 --> 02:28:42,777
I'm asking, can all the councilors, can they say, I pledge to vote for that?

1962
02:28:44,140 --> 02:28:46,122
Once it comes out of subcommittee, I pledge to vote for it.

1963
02:28:46,362 --> 02:28:50,967
I know I can't do anything tonight because it's subcommittee, but I understand the gravity of this.

1964
02:28:51,067 --> 02:28:54,951
I understand the emergency and I want to do as much as I can as quickly as possible.

1965
02:28:55,792 --> 02:28:57,233
Can the councilors actually do that?

1966
02:28:57,293 --> 02:28:59,435
Can they state, I am committed to this.

1967
02:29:00,533 --> 02:29:01,853
Matt, thank you very much.

1968
02:29:05,694 --> 02:29:10,475
Matthew, if a council wants to state that they were in favor of it, by all means they can, okay?

1969
02:29:10,595 --> 02:29:11,655
Then your answer is yes.

1970
02:29:11,895 --> 02:29:12,695
Your answer is yes.

1971
02:29:12,715 --> 02:29:15,976
This whole body can say, yes, I'm committed to this and I will vote for it.

1972
02:29:17,456 --> 02:29:18,637
Matthew, thank you for your time.

1973
02:29:21,137 --> 02:29:24,638
Any other questions from the public that would like to speak on this issue?

1974
02:29:24,698 --> 02:29:25,938
We have one more person.

1975
02:29:32,522 --> 02:29:34,523
Christopher, name and address for the record, please.

1976
02:29:35,644 --> 02:29:36,324
You have three minutes.

1977
02:29:37,425 --> 02:29:38,685
My name is Chris Briota.

1978
02:29:38,725 --> 02:29:40,386
I'm at 20 Mystic River Road.

1979
02:29:40,987 --> 02:29:45,529
I just wanted to speak in support of the eviction moratorium.

1980
02:29:45,849 --> 02:29:49,551
I think it's an important tool in our present humanitarian and public health emergency.

1981
02:29:49,992 --> 02:29:53,694
It would help protect our most vulnerable neighbors and also protect the health of our community.

1982
02:29:54,274 --> 02:29:59,637
And furthermore, I'm a homeowner and homeowners and especially landlords make a choice.

1983
02:30:00,077 --> 02:30:02,678
to invest in real estate, and there's risk in that.

1984
02:30:03,118 --> 02:30:16,842
I would support whatever the city thinks it can do to help homeowners and landlords hold on to their homes in this emergency, but to use their exposure to a volatile market as a counterexample for why we can't help renters is a distraction.

1985
02:30:17,282 --> 02:30:28,286
Furthermore, as a member of this community, I'm uninterested in Councilor Mark's protestations that eight months of inaction on the prior motion allows us to punt on responding to this emergency tonight.

1986
02:30:31,146 --> 02:30:31,427
Okay.

1987
02:30:31,747 --> 02:30:32,609
And I yield my time.

1988
02:30:32,730 --> 02:30:33,150
Thank you.

1989
02:30:37,881 --> 02:30:38,683
Okay.

1990
02:30:38,703 --> 02:30:40,647
Wilma Barr, name and address for the record please.

1991
02:30:43,387 --> 02:30:48,770
William Navar, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1992
02:30:50,251 --> 02:31:03,900
Given that it sounds like most of the council supports the substance of this motion, I was sort of, and building off of what Matthew suggested,

1993
02:31:05,283 --> 02:31:20,585
I was sort of thinking that it might be smart to advise Jess, who mentioned a petition, to get that to the councilors so they might be able to voice their support.

1994
02:31:21,426 --> 02:31:37,089
publicly without having to go through the procedures required by the Council rules, which, of course, in this situation, happen to be blocking what everybody agrees is extremely important.

1995
02:31:38,200 --> 02:31:54,890
And since it's a symbolic motion anyway, I think that this particular petition could be a useful tool in order to do an end run around the council rules and allow the members of the council to make a decision.

1996
02:31:56,259 --> 02:31:58,980
make that opinion known to the mayor that way.

1997
02:32:00,240 --> 02:32:07,902
So I hope Jess will consider following up with the council with that petition so they're able to sign that if they so choose.

1998
02:32:07,982 --> 02:32:08,342
Thank you.

1999
02:32:08,642 --> 02:32:09,122
Thank you all.

2000
02:32:11,123 --> 02:32:11,463
Okay.

2001
02:32:14,784 --> 02:32:15,784
Okay, I don't see any of the hands.

2002
02:32:15,804 --> 02:32:17,825
Clerk, did you see any of the hands up?

2003
02:32:18,925 --> 02:32:19,205
Okay.

2004
02:32:21,033 --> 02:32:28,421
I want to thank everyone for their patience and for participating in the public participation section of our meeting tonight.

2005
02:32:29,422 --> 02:32:30,863
If I'm correct, we have records.

2006
02:32:32,285 --> 02:32:32,765
Mr. President.

2007
02:32:34,087 --> 02:32:35,148
Before we do the records.

2008
02:32:35,168 --> 02:32:36,329
Vice President Carviello.

2009
02:32:36,349 --> 02:32:39,272
Before we do the records, I'd like to thank you.

2010
02:32:40,220 --> 02:32:41,601
for your leadership over the last two years.

2011
02:32:41,621 --> 02:32:42,101
Thank you.

2012
02:32:42,502 --> 02:32:46,804
And it's been a difficult, this year's been a very difficult one for you.

2013
02:32:48,286 --> 02:32:57,992
So again, I wanna thank you for your leadership over the last two years, and I hope I can hold up to the same high standards that you've done over this time.

2014
02:32:58,272 --> 02:32:59,133
Vice President, thank you.

2015
02:32:59,213 --> 02:33:01,454
So I thank you, and good work.

2016
02:33:01,695 --> 02:33:03,396
Thank you very much, I appreciate that, thank you.

2017
02:33:05,015 --> 02:33:08,557
And actually, I want to thank- Mr. President?

2018
02:33:08,617 --> 02:33:09,737
Yes, Scott Pelley.

2019
02:33:10,317 --> 02:33:13,039
I think that tonight's a good example.

2020
02:33:13,259 --> 02:33:22,242
I think that the pressure that the president's put under when everybody feels so passionate about something that, in essence, we all agree on.

2021
02:33:23,143 --> 02:33:33,147
It's just the presentation of it and sometimes the protocol that needs to be followed by this body that not everybody understands.

2022
02:33:33,867 --> 02:33:40,552
So it's tough to stand up there, I know that we butted heads in due respect.

2023
02:33:41,573 --> 02:33:48,939
It's a tough position, but I want to applaud what you've done and it's been two years.

2024
02:33:48,999 --> 02:33:58,067
So again, thank you and appreciate the lack of hair now that you have due to this position.

2025
02:34:00,534 --> 02:34:01,614
Yeah, thanks.

2026
02:34:03,315 --> 02:34:04,455
Thank you, Councilor Scott Fevella.

2027
02:34:04,475 --> 02:34:05,955
I want to thank all my councilors.

2028
02:34:05,995 --> 02:34:11,557
This is my last meeting as president and in January, I'll be down on the floor here.

2029
02:34:12,177 --> 02:34:17,259
And I want to thank President-Elect Caviello and Vice President-Elect Knight.

2030
02:34:17,699 --> 02:34:19,619
I want to wish them well next year.

2031
02:34:19,859 --> 02:34:25,061
And I want to thank all my councilors for all their hard work and dedication to the city.

2032
02:34:26,041 --> 02:34:29,162
It has been, it's been two years and

2033
02:34:30,442 --> 02:34:31,744
There's been a lot of hard work here.

2034
02:34:31,764 --> 02:34:37,309
It's funny, I was looking at the meetings today and today we had, this is our 38th meeting.

2035
02:34:38,050 --> 02:34:39,992
Tonight was our 50th committee of the whole.

2036
02:34:41,574 --> 02:34:42,475
10 subcommittee meetings.

2037
02:34:42,495 --> 02:34:45,438
That takes you to about 98 meetings this calendar year.

2038
02:34:47,100 --> 02:34:48,741
And we don't meet a good chunk in the summer.

2039
02:34:48,801 --> 02:34:51,364
So I know, you know,

2040
02:34:53,397 --> 02:34:56,939
There's been a lot of weeks where we've met Tuesday night, Wednesday night, sometimes Thursday night.

2041
02:34:57,580 --> 02:34:59,581
And I know that's a lot of time away from your families.

2042
02:35:00,281 --> 02:35:03,863
And I thank you for your dedication, your hard work.

2043
02:35:04,484 --> 02:35:09,667
And like I said, I look forward to being down on the floor and being able to participate more.

2044
02:35:10,387 --> 02:35:13,389
And I want to thank you for all your hard work and dedication.

2045
02:35:13,429 --> 02:35:14,430
So thank you so much.

2046
02:35:15,170 --> 02:35:16,251
So we have the records.

2047
02:35:18,252 --> 02:35:19,313
The records are

2048
02:35:20,434 --> 02:35:24,856
Let's see, the table of records in the meeting of December 8th, 2020 were passed to Vice President Carviello.

2049
02:35:24,916 --> 02:35:26,977

2050
02:35:27,177 --> 02:35:30,779

And she's a tremendous woman.

She gets on the bus almost daily and goes to Davis Square, gets out there, has her lunch, comes back on the bus.

2079
02:36:23,216 --> 02:36:26,357
She's a tremendous woman, a tremendous mother, wife.

Mr. President, if I could take a moment to thank all the residents in this community who've come out to support all the non-profit organizations with gifts, food and everything.

2108
02:37:40,620 --> 02:37:47,403
In my 30 years of doing community work, I've always found that people come out more.

2109
02:37:48,141 --> 02:37:51,343
And when times are tough, then when times are good.

2110
02:37:52,064 --> 02:38:09,936
And as I say, there's the Rotary, the Kiwanis, the Family Network, all these organizations, they put food, they put a lot of time and effort into making sure that a lot of families, Medford families, were taken care of this year with toys and all kinds of essentials.

2111
02:38:09,956 --> 02:38:16,020
So again, thank you to all the residents who came out and supported everybody to make sure that everybody in this community

2112
02:38:17,017 --> 02:38:18,258
has a good Christmas.

2113
02:38:18,438 --> 02:38:20,540
