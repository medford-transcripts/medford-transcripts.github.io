11
00:14:00,827 --> 00:14:03,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for being here and funding recipients.

12
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:10,532
[SPEAKER_03]: So the purpose of this meeting is to discuss the city's Community Development Block Grant annual action plan for community development and planning.

13
00:14:11,263 --> 00:14:20,067
[SPEAKER_03]: The action plan contains the proposed use of CDBG funds for the program year, which extends from July 1st, 2025 through July 30th, 2026.

14
00:14:21,288 --> 00:14:23,349
[SPEAKER_03]: CDBG is a program of the U.S.

15
00:14:23,589 --> 00:14:34,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Department of Housing and Urban Development that began in 1974 and fiscal year 26 will be the city of Medford's program year 51 of CDBG funding.

16
00:14:34,655 --> 00:14:35,195
[SPEAKER_03]: That's exciting.

17
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:36,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I love a prime number.

18
00:14:36,695 --> 00:14:41,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll turn it over to you, Manager Siegel, unless there are any preliminary comments from my fellow councilors.

19
00:14:43,577 --> 00:14:44,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing none, please take it away.

20
00:14:45,157 --> 00:14:46,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you so much.

21
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:47,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Laurel Siegel.

22
00:14:47,698 --> 00:14:50,359
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the CDBG manager for the city of Medford.

23
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:54,300
[SPEAKER_02]: We're actually, we have three plans before us.

24
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:03,962
[SPEAKER_02]: We are a CDBG entitlement community, which means that we receive direct funding from the Department of Housing and Urban Development every year.

25
00:15:05,543 --> 00:15:17,528
[SPEAKER_02]: And every five years we're required to create what's called a comprehensive plan, which is a plan that establishes our goals for utilizing CDBG funding over the next five years.

26
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:26,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Every year we also have an annual action plan that is more specific in terms of the projects and activities and the amounts of money that we plan to spend within the coming year.

27
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:32,614
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, we have recently updated our citizen participation plan.

28
00:15:33,074 --> 00:15:41,776
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the document that provides the guidelines for how we engage with public public engagement is very important part of the CDBG process.

29
00:15:44,097 --> 00:15:50,302
[SPEAKER_02]: public comment periods and legal notice periods and ways that the public can be participating in the process.

30
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:52,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Um all of these documents are available.

31
00:15:52,564 --> 00:15:55,707
[SPEAKER_02]: We've created a new CDBG page on the city's website.

32
00:15:56,067 --> 00:16:01,232
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of the documents are available for review at Medford MA dot org slash CDBG.

33
00:16:01,932 --> 00:16:06,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Um and all of these documents will be open for public comment until May 12th of this year.

34
00:16:07,597 --> 00:16:15,720
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to give a little bit of an overview here, we do not yet know the amount of our funding for next year.

35
00:16:17,081 --> 00:16:23,944
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been notified, our plans are typically required to be submitted to HUD for review and approval by May 15th.

36
00:16:24,364 --> 00:16:28,326
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been told that we'd be notified of the amount of our funding by May 15th.

37
00:16:28,846 --> 00:16:31,327
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's possibility there may be a delay

38
00:16:32,067 --> 00:16:33,768
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll allow for an extension in that case.

39
00:16:34,148 --> 00:16:43,153
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the figures that you see in these plans are based on an estimate, based on our current year's funding, which is a little bit over 1.384 million.

40
00:16:44,274 --> 00:16:55,380
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're estimated figures and we have a mechanism in the documents for adjusting the figures up and down based on whatever the final amount may be.

41
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:59,643
[SPEAKER_02]: So within the annual action plan,

42
00:17:00,884 --> 00:17:15,525
[SPEAKER_02]: We are allowed to commit up to 20% of our funding towards administrative costs that includes staffing in the coming year we're proposing that pays my salary it also pays for our housing planner, and for a person of our economic development planner.

43
00:17:16,246 --> 00:17:31,984
[SPEAKER_02]: We are also allowed to expend up to 20% on public services that the broad range of services and that's gonna be the bulk of this meeting, having our proposed grantees discuss the type of services that they provide for our residents, and the rest goes into what are called projects.

44
00:17:32,765 --> 00:17:34,487
[SPEAKER_02]: We have several projects slated.

45
00:17:36,248 --> 00:17:53,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Continuing, we started this year a pilot of our housing rehab loan program that enables us to provide up to $25,000 per home to our low and moderate income residents to make critical improvements to allow them to stay in their home, things like roof replacement, heating systems, other replacements.

46
00:17:54,584 --> 00:17:57,507
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also continuing our economic development programs.

47
00:17:57,527 --> 00:18:01,290
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a new vacant storefront grant program that encourages

48
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:09,839
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses to relocate to identify vacant storefronts and we provide a financial incentive coupled with a tax incentive from the state.

49
00:18:10,619 --> 00:18:18,588
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also about to launch right now our first round of an incubator pop up for micro enterprises those are small businesses with fiber cure.

50
00:18:19,068 --> 00:18:22,531
[SPEAKER_02]: employees and that will be in Medford Square.

51
00:18:23,411 --> 00:18:31,538
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an opportunity to help lift a new retail business and then hopefully launch them and create new retail around our city.

52
00:18:32,158 --> 00:18:40,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Our plan is to do a second round of that next year as well as having a technical assistance program for micro enterprises to help them and establish their businesses.

53
00:18:41,105 --> 00:18:41,726
[SPEAKER_02]: infrastructure improvements.

54
00:18:41,786 --> 00:18:56,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Um and then last, the largest chunk of the money will go generally goes to infrastructure improvements and that will be going to ADA sidewalk and roadway improvements, widening sidewalks, adding ramps, and curb cuts, and other requirements to make our

55
00:18:58,827 --> 00:19:01,089
[SPEAKER_02]: If there are any questions, please stop me.

56
00:19:02,289 --> 00:19:03,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, I'll keep going.

57
00:19:04,591 --> 00:19:20,280
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this evening, what we have done is we have invited our proposed grantees for public services to join us and present to you a very brief description of the program that they are planning to utilize our CDBG funding for.

58
00:19:22,001 --> 00:19:40,672
[SPEAKER_02]: and I have provided you with a table, you know, if you want me to go through any detail I can of the amounts that they've requested, amounts that they've previously received funding, with the exception of one group that's here tonight, all of them have been receiving CDBG funding in prior years, and also the recommended amount of their funding is in the table that I provided.

59
00:19:41,992 --> 00:19:56,180
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first group on the list, I'll just go through them alphabetically, is Action for Boston Community Development, also known as ABCD, and we do have a couple of folks in the audience from them, if you want to come up and join me.

60
00:19:57,805 --> 00:19:58,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you.

61
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:07,372
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the proposed grantee ABCD and the amount of CDBG funds requested is $42,497.

62
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:12,877
[SPEAKER_03]: That's $40,000 of CDBG funding received the prior year and the recommended amount for 2025 is 35,000.

63
00:20:12,917 --> 00:20:14,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I reading that correctly, Manager Siegel?

64
00:20:21,844 --> 00:20:22,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you.

65
00:20:22,644 --> 00:20:22,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome.

66
00:20:23,045 --> 00:20:23,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for being here.

67
00:20:24,506 --> 00:20:26,967
[SPEAKER_03]: Please state your names and addresses for the record.

68
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:28,168
[SPEAKER_03]: A business address is fine.

69
00:20:28,748 --> 00:20:33,090
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think in previous years, the council has found that a two to three minute overview is perfectly sufficient.

70
00:20:33,511 --> 00:20:33,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

71
00:20:34,091 --> 00:20:34,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

72
00:20:34,311 --> 00:20:34,711
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, thank you.

73
00:20:35,131 --> 00:20:36,192
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Joshua White.

74
00:20:36,352 --> 00:20:41,095
[SPEAKER_07]: I am the director of housing and homelessness prevention for ABCD Boston.

75
00:20:41,675 --> 00:20:42,235
[SPEAKER_07]: To my left.

76
00:20:42,856 --> 00:20:43,936
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, I'm Tondo Dube.

77
00:20:44,096 --> 00:20:50,400
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm the deputy director of housing and homelessness prevention at ABCD.

78
00:20:56,186 --> 00:21:11,199
[SPEAKER_07]: I first want to take this opportunity and thanking the Council for their ongoing partnership with ABCD Boston, and working with us and supporting the residents of Medford as well as the Mystic Valley area in this with this partnership ABCD housing has been fortunate enough to utilize the CBD

79
00:21:12,239 --> 00:21:14,100
[SPEAKER_07]: funding in two ways.

80
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:23,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Our rental assistance program that provides financial assistance to those residents that may owe any rental arrears or any utility arrears.

81
00:21:23,763 --> 00:21:31,505
[SPEAKER_07]: And then secondly, is our housing counseling services that provides case management, as well as a variety of housing related workshops.

82
00:21:32,588 --> 00:21:37,629
[SPEAKER_07]: I am proud to say that we've introduced a new type of workshop this year, and that is our financial literacy workshops.

83
00:21:38,289 --> 00:21:47,471
[SPEAKER_07]: It focuses primarily on budgeting and money management, understanding your credit score, as well as the benefits of opening up a bank account like a savings or a checking account.

84
00:21:47,851 --> 00:21:59,533
[SPEAKER_07]: The ultimate goal of these financial literacy workshops is to ensure that those that are seeking rental assistance find ways so that they don't find themselves in this situation for years and years to come.

85
00:21:59,553 --> 00:22:01,313
[SPEAKER_07]: That is the ultimate goal.

86
00:22:01,973 --> 00:22:23,858
[SPEAKER_07]: I would also say that the housing counseling workshops ensure that we are providing wraparound services for the other departments within ABCD like our fuel assistance department, our education and employment, and then we are finishing up our free tax preparation services because I know tax day is Friday so we've had a lot of interest in that for residents of the city of Medford.

87
00:22:23,938 --> 00:22:31,000
[SPEAKER_07]: So again we thank the city of Medford for their support and providing the CDBD funding so that we can better support the residents of

88
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:42,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford and again our hope is that we use this funding with the ultimate goal of providing the residents of Medford the skills necessary to become independent and self-sufficient moving forward.

89
00:22:44,094 --> 00:22:45,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for the overview.

90
00:22:46,336 --> 00:22:49,740
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any questions for ABCD from my fellow councillors?

91
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:50,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Councillor Callahan.

92
00:22:52,136 --> 00:22:52,396
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

93
00:22:53,577 --> 00:22:55,078
[SPEAKER_16]: First of all, your work is fantastic.

94
00:22:55,118 --> 00:22:56,819
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm so glad that you are here in our community.

95
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:02,443
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm just curious how you get the word out to renters about your services.

96
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:04,379
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do it in a variety of ways.

97
00:23:04,439 --> 00:23:17,964
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, social media is a big part, but we have an office in Malden, so we're going to local nonprofits, community organizations, notifying them of the funds available for rental assistance, as well as the housing counseling workshops.

98
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:20,024
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of times it is also word of mouth.

99
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:24,846
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone that may have benefited from the services will notify friends and family of those services.

100
00:23:24,866 --> 00:23:28,307
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of cold calling to either our Boston office or to our Malden office.

101
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:33,451
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, I think the big part is the social media through our Facebook, Twitter, so on and so forth.

102
00:23:33,852 --> 00:23:34,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

103
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:36,314
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

104
00:23:37,435 --> 00:23:40,397
[SPEAKER_03]: Any additional questions from Councillors for ABCD?

105
00:23:42,119 --> 00:23:48,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing none, thank you so much for being here.

106
00:23:48,465 --> 00:23:53,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Next on our list is housing families and we have Jaina Stafford on Zoom.

107
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:54,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

108
00:23:54,946 --> 00:23:55,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

109
00:23:55,406 --> 00:23:58,248
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is Jaina Stafford from Housing Families.

110
00:23:58,308 --> 00:24:00,670
[SPEAKER_03]: I see the amount of CDBG funds requested as $22,800.

111
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:09,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Prior year funding was $20,000 and the recommended amount for program year 2025 is 19,000.

112
00:24:11,056 --> 00:24:13,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Jaina, I'm going to click ask to unmute on Zoom.

113
00:24:14,338 --> 00:24:16,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Just your name and business address for the record, please.

114
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:17,580
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you for being here.

115
00:24:23,752 --> 00:24:25,854
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I think you're live.

116
00:24:25,874 --> 00:24:25,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

117
00:24:26,014 --> 00:24:26,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

118
00:24:27,095 --> 00:24:28,256
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so happy to be here.

119
00:24:28,296 --> 00:24:30,017
[SPEAKER_06]: And I wish I could have joined you in person.

120
00:24:30,518 --> 00:24:32,900
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't seem to be able to turn my camera on.

121
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,442
[SPEAKER_06]: It says the host has disabled it.

122
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:38,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure if that's accurate.

123
00:24:41,767 --> 00:24:43,389
[SPEAKER_06]: I can go forward without it, but

124
00:24:45,119 --> 00:24:49,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the clerk may try to work on that, but in the meantime, please feel free to go forward.

125
00:24:49,383 --> 00:24:49,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

126
00:24:49,683 --> 00:24:50,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

127
00:24:50,564 --> 00:24:51,164

[SPEAKER_06]: So again, thank you so much for having me.

129
00:24:53,546 --> 00:24:58,711
[SPEAKER_06]: I wanted to be there in person, but I had some extra family obligations this week, so I couldn't make it.

130
00:24:59,952 --> 00:25:01,574
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am Jaina Stafford.

137
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:22,403
[SPEAKER_06]: And we recently rebranded our name for our department.

138
00:25:22,443 --> 00:25:30,749
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're now Legal Aid for Wellbeing and Stability, which has the nice attribute of our acronym is LAWS.

139
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:34,712
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're doing the same homelessness prevention and legal services work.

140
00:25:34,772 --> 00:25:38,114
[SPEAKER_06]: We just hope that our name is a little bit easier for people to say.

141
00:25:38,154 --> 00:25:40,376
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're kind of rolling that out slowly.

142
00:25:40,416 --> 00:25:42,617
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm just telling everyone as I'm meeting them.

143
00:25:43,578 --> 00:25:46,460
[SPEAKER_06]: We are so appreciative for these funds.

144
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,741
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been receiving them for,

145
00:25:48,386 --> 00:25:52,952
[SPEAKER_06]: for many years and we've continued to do our work in the community.

146
00:25:52,972 --> 00:26:00,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Our program started in 1991 and we're still the only legal services provider located in the Tri-Cities.

147
00:26:01,661 --> 00:26:05,725
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we have a model that is a little bit different from other providers.

148
00:26:05,765 --> 00:26:22,620
[SPEAKER_06]: We couple homelessness prevention financial assistance when it's available and then also legal services and we found that that's the best way to impact homelessness prevention and to keep people's tenancy stabilized part of our work is also

149
00:26:23,256 --> 00:26:26,978
[SPEAKER_06]: if we cannot do that at that point, or we meet people later, is eviction defense.

150
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:31,640
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do a lot of that too, all with the mission of keeping people housed.

151
00:26:32,961 --> 00:26:42,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Housing families as a bigger entity has a lot of other programs, and that is useful for some of our clients too, because we are able to refer within housing families.

152
00:26:42,966 --> 00:26:46,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll just give a small amount of information.

153
00:26:46,288 --> 00:26:49,450
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have our leasing program, we have permanent supportive housing,

154
00:26:49,855 --> 00:26:56,258
[SPEAKER_06]: They have family shelter, individual shelter, clinical programs, which provide mental health supports.

155
00:26:56,338 --> 00:27:01,139
[SPEAKER_06]: We have children programming, tutoring, and we also have our resource hub.

156
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:09,023
[SPEAKER_06]: For the work that we do for this program, we requested, I believe it was just over 22,000 for this coming year.

157
00:27:09,043 --> 00:27:10,943
[SPEAKER_06]: We would serve 175 individuals in the Medford area.

158
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:25,057
[SPEAKER_06]: and we provide information, referrals, brief advice, advocacy, and representation primarily relating to eviction defense and housing law.

159
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:31,981
[SPEAKER_06]: By the end of the fourth quarter of our last, I'm sorry, did I speak over someone?

160
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:34,563
[SPEAKER_06]: No, okay.

161
00:27:35,501 --> 00:27:37,542
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought I heard somebody say something, sorry.

162
00:27:38,422 --> 00:27:43,523
[SPEAKER_06]: By the end of the fourth quarter of our last full year, we had exceeded our goal.

163
00:27:43,583 --> 00:27:47,724
[SPEAKER_06]: We served 207 Medford residents and our goal was set at 155.

164
00:27:48,644 --> 00:27:58,006
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's lots of need in the community and we're happy to help fill that with our programs and then of course with our other agencies that are here tonight.

165
00:27:59,787 --> 00:28:00,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

166
00:28:00,787 --> 00:28:04,610
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I have, and I'm happy to take any questions or answer anything that I can.

167
00:28:05,391 --> 00:28:05,791
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

168
00:28:05,931 --> 00:28:06,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

169
00:28:06,591 --> 00:28:08,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I see Councillor Lemming has a question.

170
00:28:08,453 --> 00:28:09,434
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

171
00:28:11,295 --> 00:28:12,696
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no question.

172
00:28:12,736 --> 00:28:24,765
[SPEAKER_10]: I just would like to express my own appreciation for your organization, for your work particularly in helping us to establish the pilot program for

173
00:28:25,839 --> 00:28:48,024
[SPEAKER_10]: veteran renters, um, as well as, uh, you know, personally working with, uh, some residents in Menford who were working with, uh, who were experiencing housing instability and needed the, uh, needed the mediation support when they were, uh, moving apartments to prevent them from being homeless.

174
00:28:48,804 --> 00:28:51,145
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand that in these cases, the, uh,

175
00:28:52,865 --> 00:29:03,390
[SPEAKER_10]: need is always greater than the capacity to serve the need, but I just would like to express my appreciation for your organization and organizations like yours.

176
00:29:03,410 --> 00:29:11,954
[SPEAKER_10]: I do wish that we could provide more funding to in the future so that you can continue the work you do.

177
00:29:12,094 --> 00:29:12,434
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

178
00:29:13,555 --> 00:29:14,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

179
00:29:14,475 --> 00:29:15,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate that.

180
00:29:17,177 --> 00:29:18,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

181
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:24,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing no other comments from councillors, thank you so much for being here.

182
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Jayna, we really appreciate it and thank you for your work.

183
00:29:26,653 --> 00:29:27,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

184
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:36,747
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, next on our list is the Medford Council on Aging and we have Pam Kelly on Zoom for us.

185
00:29:37,599 --> 00:29:45,863
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you for being here, Pam, and I see the amount of CDBG funds requested at $29,717.50, amount received in the prior year, $27,000, and the recommended amount for program year 2025, $24,000.

186
00:29:45,943 --> 00:29:47,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Where'd you go, Pam?

187
00:29:47,823 --> 00:29:48,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there you are.

188
00:29:48,484 --> 00:29:49,104
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, everybody.

189
00:29:49,144 --> 00:29:50,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, I'm just trying to fix my camera.

190
00:29:50,925 --> 00:29:51,545
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, there we go.

191
00:30:08,002 --> 00:30:08,362
[SPEAKER_04]: crazy.

192
00:30:09,102 --> 00:30:10,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully that's better.

193
00:30:11,724 --> 00:30:12,664
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

194
00:30:12,904 --> 00:30:13,924
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Pamela Kelly.

195
00:30:14,004 --> 00:30:21,688
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the director at the Medford Council on Aging Senior Center, located at 101 Riverside Ave, Medford, just diagonally behind City Hall.

196
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:24,729
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been there since, the building's been there since 1981.

197
00:30:24,889 --> 00:30:27,370
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been with the senior center since

198
00:30:31,179 --> 00:30:32,680
[SPEAKER_04]: 2008 actually.

199
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we're very happy to have the CDBG grant.

200
00:30:37,283 --> 00:30:42,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we have four different areas that we received the funding that is dispersed to.

201
00:30:43,628 --> 00:30:46,790
[SPEAKER_04]: One is to assist our social worker with her hours.

202
00:30:47,571 --> 00:30:54,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, she is only part time and, um, the need for a social worker in the city is quite demanding.

203
00:30:55,357 --> 00:30:57,178
[SPEAKER_04]: The city right now has nearly 13,000

204
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:01,841
[SPEAKER_04]: seniors who are aged 60 years of age and older.

205
00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:08,145
[SPEAKER_04]: So not that she sees all of them, but the demand each year is becoming more and more.

206
00:31:08,925 --> 00:31:20,713
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that extra funding helps to keep her hours at the 25 hours we're hoping to increase, but we'll have to see what the other budgets that I do get.

207
00:31:21,553 --> 00:31:42,531
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, we have a home maintenance program, and we have a gentleman that works part-time to go to people's homes who may need assistance with changing the batteries in their smoke detectors, their CO2 detectors, changing light bulbs that are in ceiling fixtures, and anything that's going to

208
00:31:44,112 --> 00:31:44,752
[SPEAKER_04]: cause harm.

209
00:31:44,912 --> 00:31:47,253
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want them going up on ladders or chairs.

210
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:52,715
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have that free service to the seniors that live in Medford.

211
00:31:53,775 --> 00:31:54,836
[SPEAKER_04]: It's used quite often.

212
00:31:55,476 --> 00:32:04,239
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, in the summertime, putting those heavy air conditioning windows in the windows and then taking them out in the fall is one of the big things that we have.

213
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:07,119
[SPEAKER_04]: during the summer and the fall season.

214
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:15,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, we have a Mystic Valley Elder Services Title III match that is used with this funding.

215
00:32:16,541 --> 00:32:32,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Mystic Valley Elder Services is part of the ASAP, the local ASAP, that assists all of the Medford senior residents, whether it's for in-home care, Meals on Wheels, many different trip information services,

216
00:32:34,845 --> 00:32:42,249
[SPEAKER_04]: And we help subsidize that funds, each year, and it's matched through another formula grant that I receive.

217
00:32:42,749 --> 00:32:45,970
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the fourth area is our recreational transportation.

218
00:32:46,511 --> 00:32:49,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Many of the older adults they do not drive any longer.

219
00:32:49,812 --> 00:32:54,214
[SPEAKER_04]: and they don't get to go out and socialize in a fun atmosphere.

220
00:32:54,614 --> 00:33:13,541
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have day trips that will take them out on motor coaches or our van to, for example, tomorrow we have a trip going to Providence, Little Italy, and we're able to subsidize the rate to bring it down some so that people can afford it, make it more affordable and a fun way to

221
00:33:14,261 --> 00:33:15,622
[SPEAKER_04]: have a great excursion out.

222
00:33:16,082 --> 00:33:25,187
[SPEAKER_04]: We usually average about 10 trips a year, so that funding helps many seniors in Medford get out and about and see different places.

223
00:33:26,508 --> 00:33:30,450
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank the council for giving us this opportunity tonight.

224
00:33:30,991 --> 00:33:34,993
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, if you have any questions, I'm available.

225
00:33:36,114 --> 00:33:36,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

226
00:33:36,954 --> 00:33:40,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for being with us, and thank you for your hard work all year round.

227
00:33:40,656 --> 00:33:40,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

228
00:33:41,016 --> 00:33:42,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any questions?

229
00:33:42,457 --> 00:33:43,578
[SPEAKER_03]: I see Councillor Lemming.

230
00:33:45,892 --> 00:33:52,539
[SPEAKER_10]: This is just another shout of appreciation for you personally.

231
00:33:53,000 --> 00:34:07,615
[SPEAKER_10]: You've been a wonderful partner to this Council, especially in getting the word out about different municipal happenings to

232
00:34:09,396 --> 00:34:18,681
[SPEAKER_10]: the elderly population method as well as providing just a really great social center for a lot of seniors in the city.

233
00:34:18,701 --> 00:34:27,187
[SPEAKER_10]: You're also just like a very nice person generally, which I appreciate as well.

234
00:34:27,967 --> 00:34:29,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Once again,

235
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:38,036
[SPEAKER_10]: I do wish that we were able to give more funding to these programs.

236
00:34:38,856 --> 00:34:53,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Having a social worker to support the senior residents in our city is definitely something that I do wish we had more of.

237
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:58,984
[SPEAKER_10]: But with funding coming in from the federal government, it's another story.

238
00:35:00,789 --> 00:35:03,210
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no, no questions about this.

239
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:06,251
[SPEAKER_10]: But I just like to just like to thank you.

240
00:35:06,951 --> 00:35:07,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, counselor.

241
00:35:07,691 --> 00:35:08,572
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that.

242
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:10,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

243
00:35:10,972 --> 00:35:12,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Lemming.

244
00:35:13,033 --> 00:35:13,713
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you, Pam.

245
00:35:14,594 --> 00:35:15,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing no other comments.

246
00:35:16,234 --> 00:35:18,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go along to the next proposed grantee.

247
00:35:18,495 --> 00:35:18,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

248
00:35:19,355 --> 00:35:24,777
[SPEAKER_02]: The next grantee is Medford Public Schools and their after school program and we have Megan Fidler-Carrie on Zoom.

249
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:28,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

250
00:35:28,672 --> 00:35:29,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're right in front of my face.

251
00:35:30,853 --> 00:35:31,674
[SPEAKER_03]: There we go.

252
00:35:31,774 --> 00:35:33,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for being here, Megan.

253
00:35:33,194 --> 00:35:36,896
[SPEAKER_03]: And for the Medford Public Schools, we have the amount requested, 10,000.

254
00:35:37,617 --> 00:35:41,418
[SPEAKER_03]: Amount of CDBG funding received in the prior year, 9,107.

255
00:35:41,458 --> 00:35:47,461
[SPEAKER_03]: And the recommended amount for program year 2025, 8,303.

256
00:35:49,322 --> 00:35:49,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Please take it away.

257
00:35:50,243 --> 00:35:50,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for being here.

258
00:35:51,683 --> 00:35:52,024
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, all.

259
00:35:52,084 --> 00:35:52,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.

260
00:35:52,804 --> 00:35:53,804
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice to see everybody.

261
00:35:53,884 --> 00:35:54,645
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for

262
00:35:55,343 --> 00:35:59,749
[SPEAKER_00]: granting this to us for years now at this point, it makes a big difference.

263
00:36:00,310 --> 00:36:01,791
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Megan Fidler Carey.

264
00:36:01,932 --> 00:36:07,038
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the Director of Family and Community Engagement for Medford Public Schools, which is located at 489 Winthrop Street.

265
00:36:11,543 --> 00:36:21,066
[SPEAKER_00]: I, we use this, so this program that we are asking that we've asked for funds for is the tuition assistance program for the Medford afterschool programs.

266
00:36:21,506 --> 00:36:24,347
[SPEAKER_00]: Medford afterschool is a, it's a revolving account.

267
00:36:24,427 --> 00:36:34,031
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tuition supported program for child care, essentially from dismissal of the elementary schools until six o'clock.

268
00:36:34,111 --> 00:36:35,611
[SPEAKER_00]: It operates in all four schools.

269
00:36:37,032 --> 00:36:40,833
[SPEAKER_00]: As we know, many families have trouble

270
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:43,050
[SPEAKER_00]: with affording childcare.

271
00:36:43,611 --> 00:36:46,453
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very binding.

272
00:36:46,513 --> 00:36:48,494
[SPEAKER_00]: If they can't work, they can't afford childcare.

273
00:36:48,534 --> 00:36:50,376
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they can't afford childcare, then they can't work.

274
00:36:50,456 --> 00:36:54,939
[SPEAKER_00]: So this tuition assistance program is essential, and it's been a huge help to us.

275
00:36:55,299 --> 00:37:06,347
[SPEAKER_00]: The Medford Public Schools also supports the tuition assistance program internally, but this really takes a big chunk for us.

276
00:37:07,108 --> 00:37:08,169
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very appreciated.

277
00:37:09,429 --> 00:37:23,131
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working on expanding our afterschool offerings because we know, I feel like everybody that's got up in front of you today has said demand outpaces capacity in all of these services that we provide.

278
00:37:23,692 --> 00:37:30,853
[SPEAKER_00]: But for us specifically, we know that families are being asked to go back to work where they could work from home.

279
00:37:31,033 --> 00:37:33,313
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not an option as often anymore.

280
00:37:33,373 --> 00:37:35,313
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really trying to expand as much as we can.

281
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:36,714
[SPEAKER_00]: So every dollar helps.

282
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:38,054
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really appreciate this.

283
00:37:42,533 --> 00:37:44,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you so much for your vital work in our community.

284
00:37:46,294 --> 00:37:51,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any questions or comments for Megan from members of the council.

285
00:37:55,037 --> 00:38:02,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing none, thank you so much for your overview and yes I think that all counselors can attest from what we hear from the community for, I mean, year after year.

286
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,901
[SPEAKER_03]: This is meeting a an ever rising demand in the community.

287
00:38:06,921 --> 00:38:07,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your work.

288
00:38:11,001 --> 00:38:16,245
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, next on our list is Mystic Valley Elder Services, and we have a couple of representatives in the room with us.

289
00:38:19,888 --> 00:38:25,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, so Mystic Valley Elder Services, I see the amount of CBBG funding requested at $10,968.

290
00:38:25,893 --> 00:38:35,100
[SPEAKER_03]: I see that you did not apply last year, perhaps you're a first-time applicant, and the recommended amount is $9,000.

291
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:40,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, name and business address for the record, please, and thank you for being here to give us an overview today.

292
00:38:40,983 --> 00:38:41,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

293
00:38:41,663 --> 00:38:42,064
[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening.

294
00:38:42,084 --> 00:38:43,104
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Carla Madute.

295
00:38:43,204 --> 00:38:45,966
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the Director of Nutrition at Mystic Valley Elder Services.

296
00:38:46,006 --> 00:38:48,607
[SPEAKER_05]: We're located at 300 Commercial Street, Malden.

297
00:38:49,888 --> 00:38:54,811
[SPEAKER_11]: And I am Brian Berg, Nutrition's Operations Manager at Mystic Valley Elder Services.

298
00:38:54,871 --> 00:38:56,552
[SPEAKER_11]: We're at 300 Commercial Street, Malden.

299
00:38:58,390 --> 00:39:05,074
[SPEAKER_05]: So we wanted to first thank the Council for their support in past years to Mystic Valley as well, as well as the Nutrition Department.

300
00:39:05,855 --> 00:39:10,598
[SPEAKER_05]: We work very closely with Pam Kelly at Medford COA, who we were thrilled to see on camera.

301
00:39:11,818 --> 00:39:27,168
[SPEAKER_05]: What our goal is for this coming year is to ask for this fund to be able to provide shelf-stable emergency meals to the 405 consumers we have in the city of Medford, as well as to be able to provide our community partners in Medford with shelf-stable meals.

302
00:39:27,968 --> 00:39:45,105
[SPEAKER_05]: In the time during COVID our ability to have shelf stable meals for our consumers in the event of an emergency, whether that be a public health emergency as we faced or a snowstorm emergency, allowed us to provide a peace of mind and stability and food security in a time where

303
00:39:45,825 --> 00:39:58,208
[SPEAKER_05]: There was nothing but concern and panic and we really do everything that we can to provide adequate nutritious meals for our consumers but our program as well as all the programs across the country are facing funding shortfall.

304
00:39:59,268 --> 00:40:10,271
[SPEAKER_05]: This coming year we are about $178,000 short of our budget, and we do not want to compromise the care that we provide our consumers as many programs are facing currently.

305
00:40:10,771 --> 00:40:17,254
[SPEAKER_05]: We are at a time where food insecurity and need is at an all-time high, but resources continue to diminish.

306
00:40:17,434 --> 00:40:23,157
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we are asking for is to be able to provide the residents of Manfred with these shelf-stable meals.

307
00:40:23,197 --> 00:40:34,163
[SPEAKER_05]: We would send them out during the start of the winter season to ensure if we ever had a closing, a storm, or again, like I said, any type of an emergency, that they would have adequate food until we were able to reach them again.

308
00:40:38,245 --> 00:40:40,426
[SPEAKER_05]: But we want to thank you for your time tonight and for the opportunity.

309
00:40:41,641 --> 00:40:42,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

310
00:40:42,061 --> 00:40:42,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for your work.

311
00:40:44,802 --> 00:40:48,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Any questions on this programming or comments from my fellow councillors?

312
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:54,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing none, thank you so much for your overview and thank you for your impactful work.

313
00:40:54,865 --> 00:40:55,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your time.

314
00:40:55,505 --> 00:40:55,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

315
00:40:55,785 --> 00:40:57,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

316
00:40:57,205 --> 00:40:59,426
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

317
00:40:59,846 --> 00:41:05,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Next on our list is Mystic Valley YMCA and their Mystic Community Market Program and we have here

318
00:41:07,513 --> 00:41:08,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you.

319
00:41:09,354 --> 00:41:14,416
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the Mystic Valley YMCA and Mystic Community Market, I see amounts requested, 12,000.

320
00:41:14,456 --> 00:41:16,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Amount of funding received in the prior year, 12,000.

321
00:41:16,777 --> 00:41:20,899
[SPEAKER_03]: And recommended for program year 2025, 10,000.

322
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, thank you for being here.

323
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:24,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and business address for the record, please.

324
00:41:25,242 --> 00:41:27,923
[SPEAKER_03]: And thanks for giving us an overview of what you're working on.

325
00:41:29,008 --> 00:41:30,310
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for having us.

326
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:40,161
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Debbie Emerald I'm the president and CEO of the Mystic Valley YMCA, our main offices at 99 Dartmouth Street in Malden.

327
00:41:40,641 --> 00:41:43,244
[SPEAKER_14]: However, we run the mystic community market.

328
00:41:44,347 --> 00:41:46,568
[SPEAKER_14]: at 291 Mystic Ave in Medford.

329
00:41:47,048 --> 00:41:55,851
[SPEAKER_14]: And we also oversee the Mystic, Mystic, I'm going to say that Medford Youth Center over at 30 Forest.

330
00:41:56,251 --> 00:42:03,994
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and we also oversee actually the Willis-Epp Community Center over at Willis-Epp.

331
00:42:04,354 --> 00:42:07,115
[SPEAKER_14]: So we oversee those three programs in Medford.

332
00:42:07,135 --> 00:42:09,295
[SPEAKER_14]: So we consider part of our home here in Medford.

333
00:42:09,696 --> 00:42:13,817
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's why we changed our name several years ago from Aldenwine State to be more representative

334
00:42:14,385 --> 00:42:16,326
[SPEAKER_14]: of where we actually live.

335
00:42:18,568 --> 00:42:19,849
[SPEAKER_14]: So I want to thank you for the funding.

336
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:26,634
[SPEAKER_14]: I think few people know this, but in Medford, there's still a hunger gap.

337
00:42:26,694 --> 00:42:28,755
[SPEAKER_14]: We thought we had closed it a few years ago.

338
00:42:30,076 --> 00:42:37,482
[SPEAKER_14]: But when the Greater Boston Food Bank went from using kind of United States data down to

339
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:42,553
[SPEAKER_14]: more county based data, they found that the hunger gap, in fact, was not closed.

340
00:42:43,234 --> 00:42:46,756
[SPEAKER_14]: And right now we're facing about a 49% hunger gap.

341
00:42:47,517 --> 00:42:53,221
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's about there's hunger for about 5270 households in Medford.

342
00:42:54,122 --> 00:42:57,264
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's about 40% of the households in Medford have hunger.

343
00:43:03,046 --> 00:43:16,695
[SPEAKER_14]: However, we've been able to provide a lot of that and there's only, we're only about, it's going to sound like a lot but it's about 762,000 meals short, a little bit over that so there's still that 41% meal gap.

344
00:43:18,215 --> 00:43:22,658
[SPEAKER_14]: All of us together are providing about 56, 56% of the need that's out there.

345
00:43:26,384 --> 00:43:29,469
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say that for the Y, we're doing three different things.

346
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:33,816
[SPEAKER_14]: We have our food rescue program, summer meals, and the markets.

347
00:43:34,326 --> 00:43:35,346
[SPEAKER_14]: And they kind of work together.

348
00:43:35,366 --> 00:43:43,508
[SPEAKER_14]: The food rescue programs, we pick up weekly, sometimes twice a week at Aldi's in Medford.

349
00:43:44,549 --> 00:43:45,329
[SPEAKER_14]: That's twice a week.

350
00:43:45,669 --> 00:43:47,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Target, once a week.

351
00:43:47,949 --> 00:43:49,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Wegman, although that's going to twice a week.

352
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:52,390
[SPEAKER_14]: Wegman's, twice a week.

353
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:54,451
[SPEAKER_14]: And Stop and Shop in Medford.

354
00:43:54,891 --> 00:43:57,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, and we just added Crumbles, which that's a good day when we get Crumbles.

355
00:43:59,112 --> 00:43:59,753
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty impressive.

356
00:44:00,634 --> 00:44:01,696
[SPEAKER_14]: Bianca's just called.

357
00:44:01,796 --> 00:44:10,008
[SPEAKER_14]: When they have overstock, they're going to start calling us too so we can, they want to get some fresh meat out to people, especially during the summer.

358
00:44:11,113 --> 00:44:13,595
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's one aspect of what we do.

359
00:44:13,855 --> 00:44:24,783
[SPEAKER_14]: And even if we have leftover meals during the summer, because we provide hot meals, we just got a blast chiller, so that even if Tufts has leftover food for meals, we'll be able to blast chill it soon and get frozen meals out to people.

360
00:44:25,523 --> 00:44:31,548
[SPEAKER_14]: Food Link also comes to us so that we can provide fresh food to people from places like Whole Foods.

361
00:44:32,582 --> 00:44:40,088
[SPEAKER_14]: We also do the summer meals for Medford, so about 5,000 summer meals are provided to children in parks, and hopefully we'll increase that this year.

362
00:44:40,588 --> 00:44:49,135
[SPEAKER_14]: We're hoping to add a summer job component so that we're going to start now, trying to use the term, well, we're hopeful to get the Attorney General's grant.

363
00:44:49,195 --> 00:44:51,697
[SPEAKER_14]: They announced it late in the year, but we're hoping to do that.

364
00:44:52,358 --> 00:44:55,720
[SPEAKER_14]: And finally, our food market, which is where this money is used each year.

365
00:44:56,841 --> 00:45:00,124
[SPEAKER_14]: And we do a few different things with the market, as the community have.

366
00:45:03,964 --> 00:45:17,399
[SPEAKER_14]: Every other week, we go to the senior center, and we bring groceries to about 70 seniors, the seniors themselves pack the grocery bags, as we just bring boxes of food they pack them and distribute to about 70 seniors.

367
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,541
[SPEAKER_14]: walk in court in the federal properties, even with construction.

368
00:45:22,782 --> 00:45:29,325
[SPEAKER_14]: We still bring groceries to about 37 at each property so about 74 seniors receive food from home delivery.

369
00:45:30,125 --> 00:45:33,727
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's five additional homebound seniors that still need food delivery.

370
00:45:34,247 --> 00:45:39,449
[SPEAKER_14]: And as social workers at City Hall identify them, we add and take off people depending on need.

371
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:45,112
[SPEAKER_14]: And then additionally so far, we have seen at the market.

372
00:45:46,876 --> 00:45:53,960
[SPEAKER_14]: 3,927 Medford residents that were weekly or they can come up to weekly.

373
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:56,941
[SPEAKER_14]: But people come in on and off for Medford.

374
00:45:57,642 --> 00:45:59,243
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's how many we've seen so far.

375
00:45:59,463 --> 00:46:03,865
[SPEAKER_14]: And we also work with the Food Justice Council has reformed.

376
00:46:04,146 --> 00:46:14,151
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're Medford residents who lived experience that's helping us gather some information, trying to see like how can we identify the additional people that

377
00:46:15,725 --> 00:46:17,947
[SPEAKER_14]: need food, and how can we get it to them.

378
00:46:18,627 --> 00:46:23,271
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're looking into, they're doing some research and trying to spread out what we can do.

379
00:46:24,131 --> 00:46:26,133
[SPEAKER_03]: So we thank you very much for your help.

380
00:46:27,089 --> 00:46:29,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you so much for that overview.

381
00:46:29,470 --> 00:46:33,031
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's always striking to hear about just how many distribution channels you have through our community.

382
00:46:33,891 --> 00:46:44,095
[SPEAKER_03]: And also apart from the distribution itself, I think it's so meaningful to have the kind of statistics and bird's eye view of the problem of food insecurity in our community that you are able to help us apprehend.

383
00:46:44,215 --> 00:46:45,215
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for that.

384
00:46:46,195 --> 00:46:50,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any questions or comments from the council for Debbie?

385
00:46:53,738 --> 00:46:55,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing none, thank you so much for being here.

386
00:46:55,419 --> 00:46:56,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your work.

387
00:46:56,711 --> 00:46:57,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

388
00:47:00,133 --> 00:47:05,516
[SPEAKER_02]: Our next agency is SCM Community Transportation, and we have John here in the room with us.

389
00:47:07,137 --> 00:47:07,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

390
00:47:08,117 --> 00:47:08,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome.

391
00:47:09,638 --> 00:47:20,684
[SPEAKER_03]: I see the amount requested at $94,500, amount of funding received in the prior year, $90,000, and recommended amount for program year 2025 at $75,000.

392
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:23,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice to see you again.

393
00:47:23,486 --> 00:47:23,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome back.

394
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:25,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and business address for the record, please.

395
00:47:26,897 --> 00:47:27,778
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, folks.

396
00:47:27,858 --> 00:47:29,059
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is John Keegan.

397
00:47:29,079 --> 00:47:33,823
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm the executive director at SCM Transportation, aka door-to-door.

398
00:47:35,444 --> 00:47:42,871
[SPEAKER_13]: We provide transportation primarily to seniors and individuals with disabilities who can't use public transportation.

399
00:47:43,932 --> 00:47:49,436
[SPEAKER_13]: We do that in three main areas, medical, transportation, appointments,

400
00:47:50,751 --> 00:47:52,454
[SPEAKER_13]: and anything else in that category.

401
00:47:53,837 --> 00:47:57,163
[SPEAKER_13]: We also take people shopping to various

402
00:47:58,433 --> 00:48:00,114
[SPEAKER_13]: to various shopping centers.

403
00:48:00,234 --> 00:48:02,075
[SPEAKER_13]: We do that by neighborhood.

404
00:48:02,976 --> 00:48:05,157
[SPEAKER_13]: One week, we'll be going to Market Basket.

405
00:48:05,277 --> 00:48:09,199
[SPEAKER_13]: One week, we'll be going to stop and shop from different neighborhoods in the city.

406
00:48:10,620 --> 00:48:20,605
[SPEAKER_13]: And we also provide a fair amount of transportation to the Community Family Adult Day Health Program.

407
00:48:21,746 --> 00:48:36,527
[SPEAKER_13]: So all of this, we believe really allows seniors and folks with disabilities to stay engaged in the cities and the city, usually once or twice a month I'll manage to work my way into driving.

408
00:48:37,108 --> 00:48:39,890
[SPEAKER_13]: for some reason, haven't been able to work my way out of that.

409
00:48:40,651 --> 00:48:42,532
[SPEAKER_13]: And, but it's actually great.

410
00:48:42,612 --> 00:48:43,653
[SPEAKER_13]: I get to meet people.

411
00:48:44,054 --> 00:48:49,238
[SPEAKER_13]: I usually tell them who I am and I get to ask them what they think of the service.

412
00:48:49,838 --> 00:48:57,924
[SPEAKER_13]: I do occasionally get a few complaints about timeliness, but mostly they say they are not sure what they would do without the service.

413
00:48:58,485 --> 00:49:02,828
[SPEAKER_13]: So I take that as a good pat on the back for my crew and

414
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:11,473
[SPEAKER_13]: This year we're projected to provide among those three services approximately 8,000 rides.

415
00:49:12,073 --> 00:49:13,394
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's a fair amount.

416
00:49:13,434 --> 00:49:18,437
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been a partner with Medford for 44 years.

417
00:49:18,937 --> 00:49:21,198
[SPEAKER_13]: The M in SCM is Medford.

418
00:49:23,779 --> 00:49:40,465
[SPEAKER_13]: A slight gold halo on some of the clouds of late has been I've been working with Laura on a small transportation committee and coincidentally through mass dot we received an innovation grant and.

419
00:49:41,555 --> 00:49:45,297
[SPEAKER_13]: part of the goal was to sort of spread what we could do around.

420
00:49:45,317 --> 00:50:00,184
[SPEAKER_13]: We have a fair amount of involvement with a number of cities, but we've been able to extend a little bit what we're doing sort of first come first serve in Medford by expanding where people can go.

421
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:02,585
[SPEAKER_13]: We're fairly prescribed in our general

422
00:50:03,284 --> 00:50:15,831
[SPEAKER_13]: contractual obligations, but this has allowed us to, excuse me, allow people to maybe visit someone, go to the hairdresser, something we frequently get requests to.

423
00:50:16,531 --> 00:50:28,117
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's allowed us to at least consider extending some of our earliest hours to eight o'clock, which is also something we get requests, could we get picked up at eight instead of nine?

424
00:50:28,697 --> 00:50:31,299
[SPEAKER_13]: I won't explain the logistics behind the nine o'clock.

425
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:46,669
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's just started over these last couple months, but I look at that as a little plus, and that is, oh, and did I say we're at 167 Holland Street in Somerville?

426
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:49,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you so much.

427
00:50:51,873 --> 00:50:57,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Any questions or comments from my fellow councillors for SCM, aka door-to-door?

428
00:51:00,065 --> 00:51:01,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing none, thank you so much for your hard work.

429
00:51:02,006 --> 00:51:02,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for being here.

430
00:51:02,707 --> 00:51:04,528
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for your support over all these years.

431
00:51:05,348 --> 00:51:13,653
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, our next grantee is the Welcome Project, and we have Sarah on Zoom.

432
00:51:16,094 --> 00:51:16,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

433
00:51:16,495 --> 00:51:19,396
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the Welcome Project, I see amounts requested.

434
00:51:19,416 --> 00:51:19,396
$19,500.

435
00:51:19,436 --> 00:51:24,799
[SPEAKER_03]: Amount of CDBG funding received the prior year, $7,000.

436
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And the recommended amount for program year 2025, $7,000.

437
00:51:29,799 --> 00:51:30,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for being here.

438
00:51:30,919 --> 00:51:34,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Sarah, just name and business address for the record, please.

439
00:51:34,301 --> 00:51:37,462
[SPEAKER_15]: I was going to say I wasn't able to unmute myself.

440
00:51:37,482 --> 00:51:39,002
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for pertaining to that.

441
00:51:39,302 --> 00:51:40,563
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Sarah Kirubi.

442
00:51:40,703 --> 00:51:47,065
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm previously the director of multilingual programs and currently the interim executive director at The Welcome Project.

443
00:51:47,765 --> 00:51:50,926
[SPEAKER_15]: We are located at 530 Mystic Ave in Somerville.

444
00:51:52,107 --> 00:51:58,509
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to thank you all for continuing to support our Medford English for Parents program.

445
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:03,384
[SPEAKER_15]: We at the welcome project have been around since 1987.

446
00:52:03,944 --> 00:52:20,780
[SPEAKER_15]: We've been running the English for parents program in conjunction with the Somerville public schools for many years, but expanded into Medford to serve Medford parents in spring 2023 and received funding from the city last year for the 1st time.

447
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,821
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was.

448
00:52:22,297 --> 00:52:26,861
[SPEAKER_15]: really invaluable to helping us continue classes in Medford and for Medford parents.

449
00:52:26,961 --> 00:52:37,850
[SPEAKER_15]: So we offer English language instruction at the beginner level to Medford parents, and we have parents from every school in Medford in our program.

450
00:52:38,971 --> 00:52:47,038
[SPEAKER_15]: We focus our English classes and our curriculum on helping immigrant parents navigate the Medford school system, which might be very different than

451
00:52:47,562 --> 00:52:55,434
[SPEAKER_15]: what they're used to in their home countries, help them support their children through their education, both through things like homework help, which

452
00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:08,778
[SPEAKER_15]: an increased level of English fluency helps with, but also in terms of navigating parent-teacher conferences and meeting with a teacher, getting their children extra help, things like that.

453
00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:20,325
[SPEAKER_15]: We also do a lot of resource sharing and leadership development, especially in light of the increased challenges faced by immigrant families in the city.

454
00:53:21,105 --> 00:53:22,887
[SPEAKER_15]: in our region right now.

455
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:28,371
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have had a great year of our classes.

456
00:53:28,431 --> 00:53:35,917
[SPEAKER_15]: We offer a morning class and an evening class in person and online for flexibility for parents.

457
00:53:36,637 --> 00:53:48,907
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've had many students who have stayed within our program and many who have also moved on to higher level classes within the Welcome Project's other English language program

458
00:53:50,135 --> 00:53:52,896
[SPEAKER_15]: considering their level had changed throughout the course of the class.

459
00:53:53,916 --> 00:53:56,597
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's about it.

460
00:53:56,637 --> 00:54:02,799
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to say thank you as well, again, for continuing to support our program in the coming year.

461
00:54:04,919 --> 00:54:05,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

462
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for the overview.

463
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:08,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for your work.

464
00:54:09,761 --> 00:54:13,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Any questions or comments from my fellow counselors for the Welcome Project?

465
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:19,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing none, just tacit support.

466
00:54:20,141 --> 00:54:21,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for being here.

467
00:54:21,762 --> 00:54:24,723
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

468
00:54:24,943 --> 00:54:30,226
[SPEAKER_02]: And our final applicant is West Medford Community Center, and we have Terry Carter online.

469
00:54:30,766 --> 00:54:31,107
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

470
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:32,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for being here, Terry.

471
00:54:34,008 --> 00:54:40,491
[SPEAKER_03]: So for our final proposed grantee, West Medford Community Center, the amount of CDBG funds requested, $21,000.

472
00:54:41,492 --> 00:54:45,534
[SPEAKER_03]: CDBG funding received the prior year, $18,000, and the recommended amount for program year 2025.

473
00:54:47,683 --> 00:54:49,324
[SPEAKER_03]: 12,000.

474
00:54:48,443 --> 00:54:49,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Terry, nice to see you.

475
00:54:49,344 --> 00:54:53,066
[SPEAKER_03]: Name and business address for the record please.

476
00:54:53,826 --> 00:54:58,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Terry E. Cotter and I'm at the West Manfred Community Center at 111 Arlington Street.

477
00:55:01,251 --> 00:55:05,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously I want to thank the council for its funding support.

478
00:55:06,134 --> 00:55:13,218
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to say that in the 13 plus years that I've been employed by the community center and the capacities of

479
00:55:15,185 --> 00:55:17,987
[SPEAKER_01]: director of the Elder Services Project.

480
00:55:18,107 --> 00:55:40,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Our chief aim has been to provide a neighborhood-driven haven for gathering, socializing, and combating the impacts of isolation amongst the seniors in our catchment area while they're primarily living on their own, whether it's in their own homes or apartments or other abodes.

481
00:55:41,323 --> 00:55:43,265
[SPEAKER_01]: We offer in cooperation with

482
00:55:45,003 --> 00:56:04,901
[SPEAKER_01]: a number of partners, principally Mystic Valley Elder Services, a three-day per week program that provides a nutritious lunch, health and wellness check-ins, exercise programming, referrals for various individuals in family needs.

483
00:56:06,393 --> 00:56:08,475
[SPEAKER_01]: and leisure and recreational opportunities.

484
00:56:09,476 --> 00:56:22,627
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, the community center itself celebrates its 90th year of existence and elder services remains a staple of our annual programming with a heavy volunteer component.

485
00:56:23,167 --> 00:56:33,356
[SPEAKER_01]: But the CDBG funding that we receive is principally used to pay a significant portion of my salary, part-time salary.

486
00:56:35,830 --> 00:56:42,112
[SPEAKER_01]: we wouldn't have been able to have the program in force for as long as we have had without this funding.

487
00:56:42,812 --> 00:56:48,753
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do again wanna thank the council and I'm certainly open to any questions that anybody might have about what we do.

488
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:51,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

489
00:56:52,314 --> 00:56:53,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for the overview, Terry.

490
00:56:53,715 --> 00:56:56,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your work with the WMCC and throughout our community.

491
00:56:58,636 --> 00:57:02,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Any questions on this programming or comments from my fellow counselors?

492
00:57:06,330 --> 00:57:06,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you.

493
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:08,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I just asked if there are any questions from my fellow councillors.

494
00:57:11,191 --> 00:57:11,912
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see none.

495
00:57:13,132 --> 00:57:14,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much for the overview, Terry.

496
00:57:14,492 --> 00:57:16,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, as always.

497
00:57:17,733 --> 00:57:18,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

498
00:57:18,574 --> 00:57:30,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any further questions or comments from councillors on any of the proposed grantees that we heard from tonight or the general plan for FY 26 for CDBG while we have manager Siegel?

499
00:57:31,261 --> 00:57:34,422
[SPEAKER_02]: If I may, I did wanna add one clarification on the dollar amounts.

500
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:44,085
[SPEAKER_02]: As you went through the list, it's apparent all of the amounts for this year, the recommended amounts are less than last year.

501
00:57:44,466 --> 00:57:46,306
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two explanations for that.

502
00:57:46,706 --> 00:57:51,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, back in 2020, we received a separate CDBG grant for the coronavirus.

503
00:57:52,448 --> 00:57:57,670
[SPEAKER_02]: And through last year, we had some remaining funds that we were applying to some of these grantees.

504
00:57:58,010 --> 00:57:59,990
[SPEAKER_02]: We no longer have any of those funds available.

505
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:09,792
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we have an additional grantee this year, and our scoring team, when we reviewed these applications, we felt that these were all worthy programs.

506
00:58:10,332 --> 00:58:16,173
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we made the decision to offer a little bit less to everybody so that we could fund everybody.

507
00:58:17,794 --> 00:58:18,074
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

508
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:20,374
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very helpful clarification.

509
00:58:20,394 --> 00:58:25,835
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll go to Councilor Seng, then Councilor Callahan, then Councilor Loewen.

510
00:58:29,491 --> 00:58:29,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

511
00:58:30,392 --> 00:58:36,743
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I just wanted to save my comments until the end to make sure everyone gets to go home early enough.

512
00:58:37,524 --> 00:58:43,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I wanted to thank all the applicants for all their hard work serving our community.

513
00:58:43,905 --> 00:58:57,611
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of these programs are programs I've either worked with, been a recipient of, or have gotten to know through these meetings and other community meetings.

514
00:58:58,251 --> 00:59:07,355
[SPEAKER_09]: And I see the work that you all are doing for our residents, doing the really hard work of interfacing one-to-one with our residents.

515
00:59:07,835 --> 00:59:10,456
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that is government at our best when we bring

516
00:59:13,197 --> 00:59:17,440
[SPEAKER_09]: government and bring all of our good work to the people, to the doorsteps.

517
00:59:18,641 --> 00:59:20,022
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I'm very grateful for that.

518
00:59:21,103 --> 00:59:38,674
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also very grateful to Laurel and our team at the Planning Development Sustainability Office for all the hard work that they've put in, into developing the action plan to decide where the funds are going to make sure everyone has a piece and to have that conversation.

519
00:59:38,734 --> 00:59:39,655
[SPEAKER_09]: I know it's really tough,

520
00:59:40,617 --> 00:59:45,639
[SPEAKER_09]: when you don't have enough money to go around, you know, we'd love to fund every project at the full level.

521
00:59:46,419 --> 00:59:56,083
[SPEAKER_09]: But, you know, I think year to year, your office really does a great job at making sure that we are funding everything that we can, maximizing what we can do with the funding.

522
00:59:57,504 --> 00:59:58,844
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm very grateful for that.

523
00:59:58,864 --> 01:00:03,466
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want you to know that we on the city council see that work and we really appreciate that work as well.

524
01:00:03,886 --> 01:00:04,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

525
01:00:04,266 --> 01:00:04,926
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate that.

526
01:00:06,147 --> 01:00:06,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councillor Saik.

527
01:00:07,908 --> 01:00:09,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Going to Councillor Callahan.

528
01:00:10,387 --> 01:00:11,027
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

529
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:18,771
[SPEAKER_16]: I absolutely echo those sentiments for everyone doing all of this work, which is incredibly vital to our community as well as the planning department.

530
01:00:19,612 --> 01:00:31,858
[SPEAKER_16]: I did have a question about the entitlements and, you know, I really appreciate you explaining that there were some COVID funds, but I'm curious about the reasoning why the entitlements do go down every year.

531
01:00:31,878 --> 01:00:35,480
[SPEAKER_16]: I assume that's something from the state, their determination of

532
01:00:35,900 --> 01:00:39,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so it's from the federal government since we're a direct entitlement community.

533
01:00:40,101 --> 01:00:45,763
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason why is actually more and more communities have been signing on to participate in CDBG.

534
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:54,045
[SPEAKER_02]: So even, for example, this year with the continuing resolution of Congress, CDBG as a program has been level funded.

535
01:00:54,546 --> 01:00:57,967
[SPEAKER_02]: But for example, Everett just signed on as an entitlement community.

536
01:00:58,207 --> 01:01:02,268
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's less, there's the same amount of money, but more communities to divide amongst.

537
01:01:03,073 --> 01:01:05,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much it's really very interesting to understand.

538
01:01:09,076 --> 01:01:09,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

539
01:01:12,958 --> 01:01:14,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you have a hand up counseling.

540
01:01:19,781 --> 01:01:20,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I think I turned on the wrong one.

541
01:01:22,513 --> 01:01:22,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead.

542
01:01:23,554 --> 01:01:48,790
[SPEAKER_10]: No, my question was related to Councillor Callahan's about the total amount going down and the reasoning for that, although I would like to, I was, I was giving shout outs to the organizations that I have worked with before and I didn't press my button in time to thank Terry Carter for his work with West Medford Community Center so shout out

543
01:01:49,983 --> 01:01:50,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Shout out to you, Terry.

544
01:01:50,824 --> 01:01:58,046
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for putting in so much of your effort to helping to run the show down there.

545
01:01:58,066 --> 01:02:08,410
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd like to also thank the rest of the applicants for applying and for all the work you do in the community.

546
01:02:10,711 --> 01:02:12,232
[SPEAKER_10]: Once again, I would like to see

547
01:02:13,424 --> 01:02:18,250
[SPEAKER_10]: more funding go to non-profits and social services.

548
01:02:19,632 --> 01:02:26,020
[SPEAKER_10]: But as Laurel was just saying, the bucket does seem to be going down every year.

549
01:02:26,040 --> 01:02:27,823
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you all once again.

550
01:02:30,972 --> 01:02:32,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you for your comments.

551
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:36,675
[SPEAKER_03]: And yes, I want to echo the praise shared by my fellow counselors.

552
01:02:37,335 --> 01:02:43,598
[SPEAKER_03]: It is hard work, work that I do not envy having to divvy up limited funds for a whole host of organizations.

553
01:02:43,658 --> 01:02:46,319
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all doing deeply critical and laudable work.

554
01:02:46,499 --> 01:02:49,701
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that you and your team do that with extreme thoughtfulness.

555
01:02:49,741 --> 01:02:56,184
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you so much for all of your work in making funding recommendations and reviewing proposed

556
01:02:57,164 --> 01:03:00,866
[SPEAKER_03]: grantees and putting together the one in the five year action plans.

557
01:03:02,007 --> 01:03:02,087
[SPEAKER_03]: It.

558
01:03:03,007 --> 01:03:14,733
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we don't have a lot of good vibes meetings but personally I always end the CDBG proposed grantee meetings and the action plan meetings feeling a little bit warm and fuzzy because it's great to see how funding that we

559
01:03:15,393 --> 01:03:19,155
[SPEAKER_03]: as a city is going to direct service provision to our residents.

560
01:03:20,136 --> 01:03:21,157
[SPEAKER_03]: And that makes me feel really proud.

561
01:03:21,837 --> 01:03:27,320
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanna thank all of the proposed grantees for sharing a little bit about your programming with the council tonight.

562
01:03:27,561 --> 01:03:31,303
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you manager Siegel for organizing and for teeing up this work.

563
01:03:33,944 --> 01:03:38,887
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next step is a public hearing at the April 29th city council meeting, if I have that correct.

564
01:03:38,947 --> 01:03:39,768
[SPEAKER_02]: That is correct.

565
01:03:39,848 --> 01:03:44,531
[SPEAKER_02]: At that meeting, I'll be seeking approval of the council on all three plans.

566
01:03:45,291 --> 01:03:53,176
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, the plans are all available on the city's website for public comment until May 12th on the CDBG page.

567
01:03:53,836 --> 01:03:54,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

568
01:03:54,957 --> 01:03:55,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

569
01:03:55,297 --> 01:04:00,020
[SPEAKER_03]: So residents can find that at MedFrontofMay.org slash CDBG if I have that right.

570
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:04,483
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of our few short URL slugs going around.

571
01:04:05,643 --> 01:04:10,306
[SPEAKER_03]: So folks can check them out there for another month, I guess.

572
01:04:12,968 --> 01:04:17,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll entertain a motion to refer this paper out of committee to regular session.

573
01:04:18,352 --> 01:04:18,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

574
01:04:19,733 --> 01:04:25,057
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll motion by Councilor Singh to refer out of committee, seconded by Councilor Lemming.

575
01:04:29,180 --> 01:04:30,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and I guess we're all here now.

576
01:04:31,681 --> 01:04:32,202
[SPEAKER_03]: All in favor?

577
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:34,223
[SPEAKER_03]: All opposed?

578
01:04:35,364 --> 01:04:35,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

579
01:04:36,425 --> 01:04:40,928
[SPEAKER_03]: Before we adjourn, is there any public comment on anything that we heard tonight?

580
01:04:42,803 --> 01:04:46,792
[SPEAKER_03]: You may raise your hand on zoom or come up to the podium.

581
01:04:52,165 --> 01:04:53,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeing none, I'm shocked.

582
01:04:56,755 --> 01:04:59,522
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to adjourn by Councilor Lemming, seconded by Councilor Singh.

583
01:04:59,582 --> 01:05:00,183
[SPEAKER_03]: All in favor.

584
01:05:01,065 --> 01:05:01,647
[SPEAKER_03]: All opposed.

585
01:05:02,308 --> 01:05:02,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.
