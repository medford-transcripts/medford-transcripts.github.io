If you would, state your name and address for the record.

36
00:02:59,406 --> 00:03:00,728
Good evening, Mr. Chairman, members.

37
00:03:01,349 --> 00:03:02,471
I'm attorney Peter Miranda.

38
00:03:03,182 --> 00:03:05,083
I represent Brian and Emily Flynn.

39
00:03:05,103 --> 00:03:07,164
Brian is here with me.

40
00:03:07,184 --> 00:03:08,986
They own 375 Riverside Ave.

41
00:03:09,006 --> 00:03:13,408
For those who don't know, 375 Riverside Ave is at the corner of Riverside Ave and Locust Street.

42
00:03:13,748 --> 00:03:20,693
For the past decade or so, it has been used as a real estate office that they had in there.

43
00:03:20,933 --> 00:03:23,434
A lot of employees, a lot of cars coming in and out.

44
00:03:23,815 --> 00:03:25,115
But it worked for the neighborhood, I think.

45
00:03:25,135 --> 00:03:26,656
I don't think it was a burden to the neighborhood.

46
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,330
You're in favor?

47
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,111
I'm in favor.

48
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:30,631
Yes.

49
00:03:30,911 --> 00:03:31,211
All right.

50
00:03:31,371 --> 00:03:32,772
We'll have you back up in a second.

51
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:33,833
Anybody else in favor?

52
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:35,634
Anybody else in favor?

53
00:03:35,994 --> 00:03:38,776
Hearing and seeing none, I declare that portion of the meeting closed.

54
00:03:39,376 --> 00:03:41,297
Anybody in opposition to this petition?

55
00:03:42,017 --> 00:03:43,178
Anybody in opposition?

56
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:46,920
Hearing and seeing none, I declare that part of the meeting closed.

57
00:03:48,301 --> 00:03:48,721
Counsel.

58
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:50,802
I haven't been here in a while.

59
00:03:50,902 --> 00:03:52,703
You can hand a- It's been a lot of years.

60
00:03:52,723 --> 00:03:53,324
All right.

61
00:03:54,084 --> 00:03:55,485
Again, Attorney Peter Miranda.

62
00:03:55,605 --> 00:03:57,666
I'm here representing Brian and Emily Flynn.

63
00:03:58,445 --> 00:04:01,006
The owner is a 375 Riverside Ave here in Medford.

64
00:04:02,386 --> 00:04:06,848
As I stated, the property has been used as a real estate office for the past decade or so.

65
00:04:07,588 --> 00:04:15,330
We are currently under agreement to sell the property to a gentleman who wants to run a hair threading spa.

66
00:04:16,491 --> 00:04:20,112
Now, he is here in the audience, Mr. Shrestha, sitting right there.

67
00:04:22,342 --> 00:04:23,903
He is not a stranger to this business.

68
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:29,085
He actually has 10 of these salons throughout the Commonwealth and actually has one here in Medford.

69
00:04:29,685 --> 00:04:31,266
He was at the mall since 2008.

70
00:04:31,346 --> 00:04:35,027
He just was thrown out because of things going over in the mall.

71
00:04:35,047 --> 00:04:36,768
Now he's at 34 Riverside Ave.

72
00:04:37,188 --> 00:04:39,189
So he's operating a threading spa there.

73
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,471
Again, he's familiar with Medford.

74
00:04:45,784 --> 00:04:48,325
He knows what he's doing, so I'm sure the business will do fine.

75
00:04:49,145 --> 00:04:52,486
I would like to point out that the business is going to be used as one employee.

76
00:04:52,986 --> 00:04:55,646
That's what he's going to have there.

77
00:04:55,686 --> 00:04:59,207
He tells me that most of his clientele come from the local area in Medford.

78
00:04:59,827 --> 00:05:01,908
A lot of them do use public transportation.

79
00:05:02,088 --> 00:05:06,249
He doesn't anticipate there'd be a problem with parking or traffic.

80
00:05:07,529 --> 00:05:10,250
A lot of people would visit the mall and possibly come over from there.

81
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:14,671
I did notice when looking at the file that the different

82
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:21,986
The police and everyone involved in the different departments had no objection to the petition.

83
00:05:22,766 --> 00:05:28,611
And as you know, it is an industrial zone now, so I believe the use that we're asking for will be beneficial to the neighborhood.

84
00:05:28,631 --> 00:05:31,333
There is some residential neighborhood abutting the property.

85
00:05:31,753 --> 00:05:41,260
This seems to me to be more in line with what the nature of the bylaw is and the underlying, wouldn't undermine what the bylaw is meant to do.

86
00:05:42,101 --> 00:05:42,421
Thank you.

87
00:05:42,861 --> 00:05:43,662
Awesome, thank you.

88
00:05:44,517 --> 00:05:51,442
Chair recognizes Councilor Knight, Chairman of the Ordinances and Rules.

89
00:05:52,603 --> 00:05:54,565
Yes, Mr. President, thank you very much.

90
00:05:55,746 --> 00:05:58,288
I have reviewed the paperwork and everything does appear to be in order.

91
00:05:58,348 --> 00:06:03,992
However, I did speak with the merits in the audience before the meeting started and they do have a couple of questions.

92
00:06:04,252 --> 00:06:09,456
If they'd like to address any of those questions, we'd be happy to do so prior to taking legislative action.

93
00:06:10,817 --> 00:06:11,157
Who does?

94
00:06:11,417 --> 00:06:12,158
Come up to the podium.

95
00:06:13,855 --> 00:06:17,757
I think Councilor Miranda might be in a position to answer some of the questions.

96
00:06:17,857 --> 00:06:18,297
Welcome.

97
00:06:18,317 --> 00:06:20,058
Just please state your name and address for the record.

98
00:06:20,318 --> 00:06:20,518
Yes.

99
00:06:20,618 --> 00:06:23,960
My name is Nathan Merritt and my address is 373 Riverside Ave.

100
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,981
So I'm the adjacent property to the property in question.

101
00:06:27,741 --> 00:06:27,982
Thank you.

102
00:06:29,215 --> 00:06:33,237
So this is actually the first I've heard the information about what was being there in the past.

103
00:06:33,617 --> 00:06:40,159
Um, while it was a realty office, um, we've been there since April of 14 and we had no issues with the business.

104
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:43,580
It was conducted the time of the hours, traffic flows, so on and so forth.

105
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:52,404
Um, some of my concerns that I had coming into here, um, I'm assuming that the hours would be similar for operation nine to five.

106
00:06:57,783 --> 00:06:58,324
10 a.m.

107
00:06:58,384 --> 00:06:59,164
to 9 p.m.

108
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:20,280
okay okay same as them all okay and that said it's actually very difficult to access my own driveway on Riverside Ave due to the nature of the configuration of that intersection so basically the stop line actually is just in front of my driveway so on a daily basis

109
00:07:21,777 --> 00:07:27,146
My other half, Kim and I, when we try to come home from work, it gets kind of congested during the day.

110
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:30,973
And it can be pretty hairy just pulling into our own driveway.

111
00:07:31,013 --> 00:07:33,557
So I do have a slight concern, and I don't think it's

112
00:07:34,572 --> 00:07:44,595
It's nothing on their part whatsoever, but I'm a little interested if there's ever been a traffic study done in there recently, only because people will, no kidding, fly right through that intersection.

113
00:07:44,816 --> 00:07:48,397
And there are times when we've almost gotten T-boned trying to come out of the driveway.

114
00:07:49,177 --> 00:07:50,397
People just ignore the red light.

115
00:07:50,417 --> 00:07:51,438
They go right through the line.

116
00:07:51,498 --> 00:07:55,019
So someone else, a customer of his, were to be coming out that same exit.

117
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:57,760
It's not a great situation whatsoever.

118
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:01,203
I don't think should necessarily hold up what they would like to do.

119
00:08:01,243 --> 00:08:09,068
I'm certainly not opposed to it But it is concern I have just as the neighbor in the area We've already had one car crashed my yard and into the stairs of that building.

120
00:08:09,128 --> 00:08:17,894
So I think the if I might suggest that the present configuration we have there is the result of traffic studies and

121
00:08:18,356 --> 00:08:26,341
that were done maybe some decades ago when there was some additional industrial development there in that neighborhood.

122
00:08:27,762 --> 00:08:33,626
And so it was done to alleviate some of the, it created a light system there.

123
00:08:34,198 --> 00:08:38,581
that allowed for better flow of traffic than existed previously.

124
00:08:39,141 --> 00:08:40,522
Yes, sir.

125
00:08:40,682 --> 00:08:47,527
I guess I'm just a little concerned that maybe there's something else that could be done to help the people that are entering or exiting through that particular driveway.

126
00:08:47,547 --> 00:08:49,808
Because right now it's actually past the stop line.

127
00:08:50,388 --> 00:08:52,430
It's kind of in this no man's land with the light.

128
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:54,831
Should you go or should you not when it's red or green?

129
00:08:55,031 --> 00:08:55,532
I have no idea.

130
00:08:57,248 --> 00:09:05,632
So that was a concern of us, just for, in general, we'd rather not have cars crashing right next to our house, if we can help it.

131
00:09:06,872 --> 00:09:09,193
And I think, any, I'm sorry.

132
00:09:12,395 --> 00:09:13,115
Madam Vice President.

133
00:09:13,155 --> 00:09:13,975
Thank you, President Deller.

134
00:09:13,995 --> 00:09:17,257
So did you say you lived on Riverside Ave, or are you on Locust Street?

135
00:09:17,297 --> 00:09:17,757
Riverside Ave.

136
00:09:18,297 --> 00:09:26,541
Because, I mean, if you look at the map, I think the second to last page of our package, it shows

137
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:38,187
It shows that, excuse me, it shows that it looks like people should be exiting this property onto Locust Street.

138
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:44,069
So I think if you just, maybe, is that how it works with the prior owner?

139
00:09:44,089 --> 00:09:45,229
Because that would solve your problem.

140
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:49,591
That's the first I've seen of this.

141
00:09:49,671 --> 00:09:50,051
Please do.

142
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:52,271
Thank you.

143
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,452
State your name and address for the record.

144
00:09:53,472 --> 00:09:56,252
Brian Flynn, current owner of 375 Riverside Ave.

145
00:09:57,113 --> 00:09:57,333
Yes.

146
00:09:59,623 --> 00:10:07,088
Currently, we would enter the premises through Riverside Avenue and exit onto Locust Street.

147
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:11,630
So with that being said, is it clearly marked?

148
00:10:13,211 --> 00:10:19,375
Is the driveway clearly marked so the new customers would know the need to come in one way and out the other?

149
00:10:19,934 --> 00:10:21,355
There's no arrows there currently.

150
00:10:21,395 --> 00:10:24,737
We just, I just knew that because I occupied it myself.

151
00:10:25,637 --> 00:10:30,220
So that's how we directed all our employees to enter and exit.

152
00:10:31,141 --> 00:10:35,583
Would, would you be amenable to possibly put in some arrows to make it more clear?

153
00:10:35,943 --> 00:10:36,484
Absolutely.

154
00:10:37,784 --> 00:10:44,068
I think that would, so, I mean, you still have people entering that near your home, but you wouldn't have the traffic jam of coming out.

155
00:10:44,248 --> 00:10:49,031
So maybe if we put some arrows, we make it clear that customers is supposed to, and employees is supposed to,

156
00:10:49,461 --> 00:10:53,162
enter on Riverside Ave and exit Locust Street, I think that would solve the problem.

157
00:10:53,182 --> 00:10:59,804
I think it's a business that's probably going to be a little bit more frequent than a real estate office, so maybe even a sign, one sign and a couple arrows would solve the problem.

158
00:10:59,824 --> 00:11:00,804
We could do both, arrows and a sign.

159
00:11:12,998 --> 00:11:16,721
If we could make that part of the record, then I'm inclined to approve this.

160
00:11:16,741 --> 00:11:22,146
The sign I would have, I would attach to the six-foot vinyl fence that separates our property.

161
00:11:22,446 --> 00:11:22,667
Sure.

162
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:23,968
There we go.

163
00:11:24,248 --> 00:11:24,468
Okay.

164
00:11:24,808 --> 00:11:24,989
Great.

165
00:11:25,189 --> 00:11:25,809
Thank you, Councilwoman.

166
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:28,432
Yeah, if we could make that a condition, I second the approval.

167
00:11:28,452 --> 00:11:29,132
I just need that paper back.

168
00:11:35,768 --> 00:11:42,632
I guess my final question was, is there any estimated impact to the property assessments in the area based on doing this conversion?

169
00:11:47,455 --> 00:11:48,715
Is my assessment going to go up or down?

170
00:11:49,736 --> 00:11:52,638
Yeah, we can send that question up to the city.

171
00:11:54,089 --> 00:11:58,132
It'd be nice to know informational-wise, but it's nothing I'm going to be opposed to.

172
00:11:58,212 --> 00:11:59,913
Nothing's a showstopper here.

173
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:07,437
Question the city assessor as to the effect of this change of use in the building.

174
00:12:08,238 --> 00:12:11,460
Will that have any effect on adjacent properties assessments?

175
00:12:15,663 --> 00:12:17,964
If we can send that to the assessor's office for an answer.

176
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:22,027
So on the motion of approval by Councilor Knight, as seconded by

177
00:12:22,686 --> 00:12:27,610
Vice president Lungo Kern with the conditions council marks.

178
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:29,191
Thank you, Mr. President.

179
00:12:29,411 --> 00:12:35,877
Um, the locus street sidewalk had some repair on it over the last year, right at the corner.

180
00:12:36,557 --> 00:12:38,499
And it's in deplorable condition.

181
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:43,543
Is that Brian, do you know if that's a city owned sidewalk or is that part of your, your land?

182
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:46,025
It's a,

183
00:12:48,891 --> 00:12:53,475
Yes, counselor, as far as the last time I talked to the building department, it did belong to the city.

184
00:12:53,955 --> 00:12:54,175
Okay.

185
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:59,860
So they have access to, uh, I think some saw lines there.

186
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:09,627
So, so that particular, uh, stretch of a sidewalk on Locust street, uh, coming around from Riverside F, uh, is in deplorable condition.

187
00:13:09,808 --> 00:13:14,471
It was dug up a few times for, I assume some road repair and some other projects.

188
00:13:15,072 --> 00:13:18,074
Uh, so I would ask that as a B paper, nothing to do with this paper.

189
00:13:18,525 --> 00:13:20,766
that the city go over there and repair the sidewalk.

190
00:13:21,226 --> 00:13:36,411
I think from what I hear from this new business, many of the people that may be traversing this particular area are going to be new to the area and that sidewalk definitely in the interest of public safety needs to be done over.

191
00:13:37,131 --> 00:13:42,933
Also, my question is to the new owners and they mentioned there's going to be one employee.

192
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:46,475
Yes.

193
00:13:46,555 --> 00:13:47,255
And my name is Shiva.

194
00:13:47,922 --> 00:13:49,943
Yeah, I'm keeping one employee.

195
00:13:50,703 --> 00:13:51,203
One employee.

196
00:13:51,704 --> 00:13:53,384
How many square feet are in that building?

197
00:13:55,185 --> 00:13:56,566
That one's 1,600.

198
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:02,268
It's 1,600 on each floor.

199
00:14:02,829 --> 00:14:03,269
Each floor.

200
00:14:03,689 --> 00:14:08,891
So your plans are to occupy both floors with this here threading system?

201
00:14:09,372 --> 00:14:14,574
I'm going to keep first floor threading spa, and second floor I'm going to keep my corporate office.

202
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:18,482
So, the trading spot will be on the first floor with one employee?

203
00:14:18,702 --> 00:14:19,523
Your one employee.

204
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:22,145
And then the second floor will be your corporate office?

205
00:14:22,185 --> 00:14:23,046
Corporate office, that's it.

206
00:14:24,648 --> 00:14:24,928
Okay.

207
00:14:26,369 --> 00:14:35,697
Mr. President, I see no problem with this based on — I think that's a great suggestion — the entrance and exit sign, because clearly it's not delineated now.

208
00:14:36,218 --> 00:14:39,841
And when you go into the lot, there's parking in the back.

209
00:14:39,961 --> 00:14:43,644
And when cars go in both ways, it makes for a very complicated situation.

210
00:14:44,192 --> 00:14:47,833
So I would ask with those amendments that this be approved, Mr. President.

211
00:14:47,893 --> 00:14:48,273
Very good.

212
00:14:48,393 --> 00:14:56,415
So on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Longo-Kern as amended with Councilor Mark's B paper.

213
00:14:56,515 --> 00:14:58,375
So we'll take the B paper first, Mr. Clerk.

214
00:14:58,735 --> 00:14:59,535
All those in favor?

215
00:15:00,195 --> 00:15:00,875
All those opposed?

216
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:02,196
Motion passes.

217
00:15:02,236 --> 00:15:05,676
And on the main motion, we need a roll call vote on this.

218
00:15:08,917 --> 00:15:09,337
Councilor?

219
00:15:10,117 --> 00:15:12,838
Just living in the area, I happen to pick up on a lot of small stuff.

220
00:15:13,373 --> 00:15:32,926
The timing of the single lights at that particular location, I've asked a half a dozen times, coming down Riverside, going towards the Fellsway, the light may stay green for about five seconds, and then the Locust Street stays green for 30 seconds, which doesn't make any sense to me.

221
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:41,492
And I think someone needs to, from our traffic department, needs to take a look at the signalization on those particular lights

222
00:15:41,811 --> 00:15:48,356
And that may be adding to the gentleman's concern of cars queuing up all the way, because they do queue up all the way back on Riverside.

223
00:15:48,376 --> 00:15:53,720
As further amended by Councilor Mox for review of the timing of the signalization.

224
00:15:55,862 --> 00:15:57,223
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

225
00:15:59,424 --> 00:16:00,245
Councilor Caviello?

226
00:16:00,665 --> 00:16:00,845
Yes.

227
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:02,286
Councilor Felco?

228
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:02,827
Yes.

229
00:16:03,227 --> 00:16:03,768
Councilor Knight?

230
00:16:04,008 --> 00:16:04,248
Yes.

231
00:16:04,928 --> 00:16:05,749
Vice President McBurn?

232
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:05,849
Yes.

233
00:16:06,810 --> 00:16:07,390
Councilor Mox?

234
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:07,891
Yes.

235
00:16:08,331 --> 00:16:09,132
Councilor Scott Kelly?

236
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:09,212
Yes.

237
00:16:10,832 --> 00:16:13,433
Yes, with a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

238
00:16:13,913 --> 00:16:14,673
Congratulations.

239
00:16:16,414 --> 00:16:17,954
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

240
00:16:17,974 --> 00:16:21,215
16-319 offered by Councilor Caviello.

241
00:16:21,775 --> 00:16:33,178
Be it resolved that the mayor begin talks with Bridgewell to continue the Heckner Center back into city property and with the possibility of turning the building into a home for our art community.

242
00:16:33,819 --> 00:16:37,320
It was turned over to Bridgewell for a $1.17 a year ago.

243
00:16:39,539 --> 00:16:45,581
and a seeing bridge wall no longer has use for the building should be turned back over to the city for the same amount.

244
00:16:45,961 --> 00:16:47,842
Chair recognizes councilor Caviello.

245
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:51,543
Uh, please be advised that counselor is suffering from laryngitis.

246
00:16:52,304 --> 00:16:52,624
Thank you.

247
00:16:52,664 --> 00:16:53,544
Thank you, Mr. President.

248
00:16:53,624 --> 00:17:07,149
Um, last week when this, uh, this was going to come to our council, he caught, he got dismissed and, um, attorney solicitor Romley gave me a little history of the property and after seeing the history of it, um,

249
00:17:07,933 --> 00:17:21,580
Seeing that Bridgewell bought this property from the city some years ago was turned over some of a dollar, and they haven't used it for many years, I think it's time that the city enter a negotiation into turning it back to the city.

250
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:29,724
And I think the solicitor said that would be happening at some point, and with the hope of maybe giving this to the art community for their art center.

251
00:17:30,224 --> 00:17:34,547
Well, that would certainly be a wonderful outcome of this scenario.

252
00:17:34,947 --> 00:17:37,048
The truth of the matter is that just recently,

253
00:17:37,593 --> 00:17:40,213
there was a, well, the history first.

254
00:17:40,674 --> 00:18:00,737
The history is that in 1991, the city of Medford crafted an RFP to sell the property to a nonprofit educational institution that assisted citizens who have mental retardation and other issues of that nature.

255
00:18:01,197 --> 00:18:07,038
As a result of that RFP process, the property, which is the field house at Gillis Park,

256
00:18:07,665 --> 00:18:10,626
was sold to an entity called the Hegner Center for $1.

257
00:18:10,746 --> 00:18:18,789
And in the deed, it said that the property had to continue to be used for nonprofit educational purposes.

258
00:18:19,709 --> 00:18:29,993
For various reasons that really are irrelevant to the discussion right now, Hegner Center became Bridgewell through a merger.

259
00:18:30,713 --> 00:18:35,715
And during 2015, Bridgewell entered into a purchase and sale agreement

260
00:18:36,183 --> 00:18:39,645
with the church to buy the property for a certain figure.

261
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:46,488
They then advised the city of this prospective sale and asked if the city would agree to it.

262
00:18:47,088 --> 00:18:53,491
A number of things happened after that and that resolution or that scenario did not unfold.

263
00:18:54,192 --> 00:18:58,914
The last that I had heard is that the church is no longer interested in purchasing the property.

264
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:03,516
In addition, the RFP process in the old file

265
00:19:04,532 --> 00:19:09,276
I had spent some time digging that up, and it was very clear what the original purposes were in 1991.

266
00:19:10,657 --> 00:19:21,465
So all I can say about Councilor Caviello's resolution about negotiating with Bridgewell to get the property back, I think that that's a healthy suggestion.

267
00:19:21,805 --> 00:19:25,688
But keep in mind that negotiation means a lot of different things.

268
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:28,971
Some people would say it means that the city should buy it back.

269
00:19:29,531 --> 00:19:33,394
Some people would say that if we buy it back, we should buy it back for no more than a dollar.

270
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:47,599
And some people say we should, if we can't come to an agreement to buy it back at a level, uh, that minimal, that we should enter into, uh, other alternative means in order to get the property back, all of which involve court actions.

271
00:19:48,199 --> 00:19:50,380
So that's really the status right now.

272
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:58,364
Uh, but the, uh, the idea that this could be quickly turned over to the arts community, uh, simply by,

273
00:19:59,423 --> 00:20:02,885
No, I don't think you're explaining to me that that wasn't going to happen overnight.

274
00:20:02,905 --> 00:20:03,045
Right.

275
00:20:03,105 --> 00:20:05,266
That would not happen overnight.

276
00:20:05,566 --> 00:20:12,448
But it's an admirable thought and admirable sentiment, however, certainly premature.

277
00:20:13,149 --> 00:20:19,831
But again, I would like, if we were able to get it back, to look into that for possibility of giving it to the Arts Center.

278
00:20:20,232 --> 00:20:26,254
I have no doubt that Mayor Burke wants to, and not only with this particular endeavor, but with

279
00:20:26,982 --> 00:20:28,083
uh, so many other ways.

280
00:20:28,203 --> 00:20:32,766
She has her eye on the city to see what an appropriate home would be for the arts community.

281
00:20:33,207 --> 00:20:44,315
She made that a part of her, um, commitment, um, to the arts community and to the people of the city of Medford because of the beneficial, beneficial attributes of that particular endeavor.

282
00:20:44,515 --> 00:20:47,777
And I'm sure that she is going to continue to live up to that commitment.

283
00:20:48,758 --> 00:20:49,078
Thank you.

284
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:51,680
Again, motion for, thank you.

285
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,182
On motion for approval by councilor Caviello,

286
00:20:54,727 --> 00:20:55,427
Good evening, sir.

287
00:20:55,447 --> 00:20:56,527
Please state your name and address for the record.

288
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:57,568
My name is Robert Penter.

289
00:20:57,608 --> 00:21:00,968
I live at Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass., former member of the Saugus party.

290
00:21:01,408 --> 00:21:05,409
I was on the Medford City Council on the year that this transfer did take place.

291
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:08,870
It was a very emotionally impact situation at the time.

292
00:21:09,510 --> 00:21:15,451
Folks that had certain disabilities were very excited over the fact that this opportunity would present itself.

293
00:21:16,071 --> 00:21:21,812
But the fact of the matter is since the property has not been used, I believe for the last two years for the purposes so stated back in 1991,

294
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:29,873
I believe, Mr. Solicitor, it would indicate that it possibly would revert back to the City of Method because of its non-use.

295
00:21:30,674 --> 00:21:38,818
And Bridgewell really has no opportunity to say to the City of Method, you have to buy it back from us to negotiate because, in fact, it was the Heckner Center.

296
00:21:39,198 --> 00:21:43,440
Whatever the agreement, the handshake was between the Heckner Center and Bridgewell, that came after the fact.

297
00:21:43,861 --> 00:21:48,423
It continued on, so to speak, as the educational nonprofit entity.

298
00:21:48,823 --> 00:21:52,485
But when they stopped using the property at that location, I believe,

299
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:59,358
The council vote and the record will reflect that once it's no longer used for that purpose, it remains as a city of Memphis piece of property.

300
00:21:59,898 --> 00:22:00,138
May I?

301
00:22:00,518 --> 00:22:00,719
Sure.

302
00:22:02,239 --> 00:22:06,381
In fact, the council was the president of the council when it was sold to the Heckner Center.

303
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,602
Um, I would only say this.

304
00:22:08,682 --> 00:22:16,426
I know that, uh, uh, some people might think that the merger of one nonprofit into another is, is of some relevance here.

305
00:22:16,646 --> 00:22:17,206
It is not.

306
00:22:17,726 --> 00:22:21,888
Bridgewell stands in the, in the, in the shoes of what Heckner would have had.

307
00:22:22,605 --> 00:22:34,813
Also, the idea that we could simply say, you didn't use it for a nonprofit use for two years, so give it back to us, would assume that they would say, oh, yes, and here's the deed, thank you very much.

308
00:22:35,173 --> 00:22:42,598
Things don't happen quite that simply, nor does it happen with the snap of a finger or with the intentions that are built on historical fact.

309
00:22:42,998 --> 00:22:45,560
That requires legal action if there's resistance.

310
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:47,941
Thank you, Mr. Solicitor.

311
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,542
But I believe the legal action was predicated upon the city of Medford and the Hegner Center.

312
00:22:52,883 --> 00:22:57,446
And what they did after that became subsequent to the original intent of the council.

313
00:22:59,627 --> 00:23:05,411
Bridgewell stands in the shoes of the Hegner Center as their successor corporation.

314
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:07,052
The Hegner Center does not exist.

315
00:23:07,392 --> 00:23:09,574
Hegner Incorporated no longer exists.

316
00:23:09,654 --> 00:23:18,540
It was merged into Bridgewell, which had the exact same nonprofit purposes to serve citizens who are mentally retarded.

317
00:23:18,927 --> 00:23:20,648
and to help them in different endeavors.

318
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:28,832
Bridgewell, the fact that there's Bridgewell and not Hegner is of no legal significance.

319
00:23:28,852 --> 00:23:29,333
Thank you.

320
00:23:29,873 --> 00:23:30,793
Thank you to both of you.

321
00:23:31,394 --> 00:23:32,014
Councilor Marks.

322
00:23:32,214 --> 00:23:36,056
Just a question to the city solicitor while he's up here.

323
00:23:36,076 --> 00:23:41,559
I know we had a lengthy conversation regarding this paper that was on the agenda for last week.

324
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:48,703
Has there been any dialogue with Bridgewell between Bridgewell and the city regarding what our intent is

325
00:23:49,083 --> 00:23:50,003
Not in the last week.

326
00:23:50,123 --> 00:23:55,885
What's happened right now is this is the aftermath of the breakdown of the prospective sale.

327
00:23:56,285 --> 00:24:02,066
So in the last seven days, there has not been, well, I shouldn't say that, in the last five, there has not been any dialogue.

328
00:24:02,467 --> 00:24:15,670
I did speak with representatives of Bridgewell and the church towards the end of last week, but they are taking care of the issues that they need to take care of to unravel the contractual relationship that they had, which would have led to the sale of the property.

329
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:19,309
And so it's a little bit early for anything else to have transpired.

330
00:24:20,911 --> 00:24:34,741
And I noticed too, that, uh, the new language, if this, uh, deal was to go through, uh, between Bridgewell and this, this church that, uh, now there's language in there requiring notification to the city.

331
00:24:35,842 --> 00:24:43,467
Um, if, if the property is no longer used for its intended purpose, is there, is there a reason why that wasn't done back in 1991?

332
00:24:45,091 --> 00:24:58,576
I couldn't say I didn't draft that deed that was done with my predecessor, Mr. Bloomsack and that notification language that would have existed between the church and Bridgewell is now of a historical interest only it's moved.

333
00:24:59,016 --> 00:24:59,176
Right.

334
00:24:59,556 --> 00:25:10,319
So, so I guess my question is, and maybe you can't answer it, but the fact that Bridgewell relocated in November of 2013, uh, does that give them any more standing?

335
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:14,881
The fact that the city hasn't approached them and two and a half years to say,

336
00:25:15,311 --> 00:25:22,636
Hey, wait, we believe that you are no longer using this to its original intent, and we would like to have the property deeded back to us.

337
00:25:23,076 --> 00:25:26,538
Yes, but there's a fundamental fact that you have to acknowledge, which is this.

338
00:25:26,978 --> 00:25:30,821
The city was not aware that they didn't use it for that purpose for that time.

339
00:25:31,201 --> 00:25:34,823
They did not advise us of that until this past holiday season.

340
00:25:35,878 --> 00:25:37,579
there was no notification before.

341
00:25:37,639 --> 00:25:39,640
There was no requirement that they notify.

342
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:45,864
They have, Bridgewell has said, uh, in writing that they have not used the property for that period of time.

343
00:25:45,924 --> 00:25:46,505
That's true.

344
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:55,090
But the city was never on, uh, never had, uh, gone there in 2013 or 14 because we didn't know where they were, uh, where they were.

345
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,111
I know that way.

346
00:25:56,171 --> 00:25:58,892
I know they're tax exempt because of their nonprofit status.

347
00:25:58,913 --> 00:25:59,413
That's correct.

348
00:25:59,733 --> 00:26:01,594
However, they still pay a water bill.

349
00:26:01,774 --> 00:26:02,275
I would assume.

350
00:26:02,535 --> 00:26:02,715
Yes.

351
00:26:03,422 --> 00:26:07,725
they still pay other outstanding liabilities on the property itself.

352
00:26:07,945 --> 00:26:08,325
Of course.

353
00:26:08,746 --> 00:26:14,810
Um, is it safe to say that they have paid their water bill for the last two and a half years?

354
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:19,213
I have not checked their water bill, but I don't think that it's in arrears.

355
00:26:19,913 --> 00:26:20,173
Okay.

356
00:26:21,074 --> 00:26:24,136
Uh, we can certainly report on their water bill if that's your request.

357
00:26:24,176 --> 00:26:33,022
No, I, I'm just concerned that, uh, that people here at city hall didn't realize, uh, an establishment that's been in the city.

358
00:26:33,408 --> 00:26:43,953
for a number of years in a city-owned building at the time that was deeded over, didn't realize that after two and a half years, they were no longer operating in the city.

359
00:26:44,534 --> 00:26:47,015
Well, I would say, you said a city-owned building.

360
00:26:47,055 --> 00:26:49,676
It hasn't been a city-owned building in 25 years.

361
00:26:50,357 --> 00:27:00,482
And in addition, there was no taxes that were required for them since they were a nonprofit, nor was there any requirement that they, on an annual basis, report into us.

362
00:27:01,182 --> 00:27:05,604
And also, it sounds a little nefarious to say that nobody here in City Hall knew.

363
00:27:06,064 --> 00:27:08,145
In fact, there was no bad intent.

364
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:20,189
The ability of Bridgewell to serve the citizens that they were serving was expanding, and the Hegness Center location was no longer sufficient for them to carry out that particular mission.

365
00:27:20,609 --> 00:27:27,072
And when that occurred, they went to other places in order to carry out that mission with the citizens that they were serving.

366
00:27:27,532 --> 00:27:30,313
So the city didn't enter that building until

367
00:27:31,238 --> 00:27:39,760
Sometime at the beginning of this year and it was me who did it and at that time they were very upfront We haven't used this for these purposes for the last two years.

368
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:42,821
So there's no been no sleight of hand No, no shell.

369
00:27:43,581 --> 00:27:54,144
I don't think it's a slight of hand, but and we've had this conversation I have a tough time as a member of the City Council knowing that this particular property was deeded over for a dollar.

370
00:27:54,324 --> 00:27:57,784
Yep for people with Intellectual disabilities.

371
00:27:58,065 --> 00:27:59,985
Yes, and they serviced a number of methods

372
00:28:00,633 --> 00:28:05,154
people for a number of years and done yeoman's work around the disabilities.

373
00:28:05,774 --> 00:28:28,798
However, some years later, I have a problem with the fact that they're no longer using that particular building for that purpose, trying to sell the building at $670,000, in which they paid $1 for, and in my opinion, which is below the assessed value on top of it, in my opinion, the city should have done a better job of safeguarding

374
00:28:29,177 --> 00:28:32,218
it's position on the property and it's no reflection.

375
00:28:32,258 --> 00:28:49,284
I know you weren't city solicitor at the time, but, uh, it's, I think someone at city hall here should have realized what was going on in the building, realized it wasn't being used for two and a half years and then maybe move towards land court or move towards negotiations with bridge.

376
00:28:49,324 --> 00:28:53,566
Well, to try to bring this back into the city coffers back into the city.

377
00:28:53,646 --> 00:28:54,226
Three points.

378
00:28:54,646 --> 00:28:56,287
One, you're entitled to your opinion.

379
00:28:56,587 --> 00:28:57,708
I don't have to agree with it.

380
00:28:58,388 --> 00:28:58,608
Two,

381
00:28:59,164 --> 00:29:00,185
I'm not looking for agreement.

382
00:29:00,445 --> 00:29:02,165
I'm just giving my opinion.

383
00:29:02,285 --> 00:29:03,806
Then we should be all very happy.

384
00:29:04,206 --> 00:29:09,329
Two, the second part of it is that that deal for $670,000 is not going through.

385
00:29:10,069 --> 00:29:16,352
Three, in the last seven days, the city of Medford has not entered an action in land court, and there's various reasons for that.

386
00:29:16,897 --> 00:29:19,599
Not the least of which is, it's not time to do that.

387
00:29:19,639 --> 00:29:24,744
It's time to allow the relationship between Bridgewell and the church to unravel legally.

388
00:29:25,184 --> 00:29:35,733
And the actions that'll be taken in the future on this property by the city of Medford will be done either by negotiation or by judicial action, one of the two.

389
00:29:38,856 --> 00:29:39,156
Thank you.

390
00:29:39,416 --> 00:29:40,017
Thank you all.

391
00:29:40,077 --> 00:29:43,700
On the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello, Vice President Lugo-Kern.

392
00:29:46,257 --> 00:29:56,520
I was just going to ask on this topic, but on a side, how many buildings are there that we've deeded over, you know, and how do we keep control of them, you know, in the future?

393
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,700
Maybe we should stay on topic.

394
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,001
How many properties have we deeded over?

395
00:30:01,021 --> 00:30:04,082
For a dollar that have deed restrictions that we should be keeping up with.

396
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:05,342
There's one that I know of, Hagena 7.

397
00:30:05,382 --> 00:30:05,822
Okay, that's it.

398
00:30:05,922 --> 00:30:06,222
That's it.

399
00:30:06,242 --> 00:30:06,562
That's right.

400
00:30:06,822 --> 00:30:07,122

414
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:29,934
sewer backup into her basement on September 3rd, 2015.

415
00:31:30,174 --> 00:31:39,840
The Department of Public Works has confirmed that a blockage occurred in the sewers main that may have caused or contributed to sewage flowing into her home.

00:32:19,111 --> 00:32:19,912
Councilor Caviello?

424
00:32:19,992 --> 00:32:20,172
Yes.

425
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:21,312
Councilor Falco?

426
00:32:21,352 --> 00:32:21,432
Yes.

427

00:32:38,628 --> 00:32:39,308
All those opposed?

436
00:32:39,368 --> 00:32:39,968
Motion carries, 16-320.

437
00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:45,091
Offered by Councilor Caviello, be it resolved that the Mayor take $100,000 from the $250,000 allocated in Resolution 15-186 and purchase single head meters to be placed on the main roads

438
00:32:55,782 --> 00:32:57,303
of the city's business districts.

439
00:32:57,403 --> 00:33:01,807
Councilor Caviello, can you tell us first about motion number 16-320?

440
00:33:01,927 --> 00:33:04,129
Thank you, Mr. President.

441
00:33:06,671 --> 00:33:15,058
This is some money that was set aside by former Mayor McGlynn in order to help out the business districts with the parking.

442
00:33:16,539 --> 00:33:22,744
It was a one-time only allocation of funds, and it's been sitting there for a bit.

443
00:33:22,764 --> 00:33:22,804
Oh.

444
00:33:23,365 --> 00:33:24,125
I'm sorry?

445
00:33:26,117 --> 00:33:26,557
Now I know.

446
00:33:27,197 --> 00:33:27,377
Okay.

447
00:33:27,958 --> 00:33:36,360
Um, I saw that last week the mayor had, uh, has a motion to purchase, I think about 86, uh, single head meters to go around the city.

448
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:46,963
Uh, it's, it's my proposal that we, we, we replace the kiosks with single head meters in all the, all the, all the main roads of the business districts throughout our city.

449
00:33:47,843 --> 00:33:53,925
And, uh, the purpose of doing this is I think everyone's biggest complaint that we hear of is,

450
00:33:55,331 --> 00:33:59,412
Kids too far away, I don't know how to operate them, various things.

451
00:33:59,952 --> 00:34:09,636
And I think by just replacing them with the basic meter will be, I think, a huge improvement to the whole area.

452
00:34:10,596 --> 00:34:16,658
If you go out and you look now, they sell a single meter that has two sides on it.

453
00:34:17,218 --> 00:34:19,519
So you don't have to buy two, we can get one that does two sides.

454
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:23,320
And also some of the newer meters have a 15 minute free button on them.

455
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:28,793
So again, I think it's something that people have been asking for in the community.

456
00:34:29,273 --> 00:34:30,454
It would be a relief to everybody.

457
00:34:31,554 --> 00:34:38,416
And then we can take some of the kiosks that we have and put them in different areas where they're a little spread apart, or in different populations, Mr. President.

458
00:34:39,076 --> 00:34:40,697
Very good measure, Councilor.

459
00:34:40,757 --> 00:34:42,317
Chair recognizes Councilor Scarpelli.

460
00:34:42,877 --> 00:34:45,278
If I can, I appreciate Councilor Caviello for bringing this forward.

461
00:34:45,738 --> 00:34:51,480
But I think that, direct me from wrong, but I think that from what I'm reading,

462
00:34:53,332 --> 00:34:56,894
There has to be some change in the discussions, that there's some changing going on.

463
00:34:56,914 --> 00:34:59,035
I'm sure there would have to be some discussion with Republicans.

464
00:34:59,076 --> 00:35:05,079
And I know that the hope is still out there to revisit the whole process.

465
00:35:05,719 --> 00:35:07,360
I would like to revisit the whole process also.

466
00:35:07,661 --> 00:35:09,422
So I think we're all in agreement with that.

467
00:35:09,462 --> 00:35:21,609
But at the same time, I think doing this or voting for this resolution right now might put the cart in front of the horse and say, look, I'd like to instead maybe ask for a report

468
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,762
Well, I know the mayor has met with them.

469
00:35:23,942 --> 00:35:26,344
I don't know what the, I don't know.

470
00:35:28,046 --> 00:35:30,708
I know council, but I, I haven't, this is, this is what we're saying.

471
00:35:30,728 --> 00:35:34,732
They're talking about, you know, I'd like to know what the mayor, what's in place.

472
00:35:34,752 --> 00:35:37,395
I maybe, maybe it's a great, wonderful plan, but

473
00:35:37,934 --> 00:35:41,817
It seems like the transcript knows what's going on, but I really don't.

474
00:35:41,877 --> 00:35:54,748
So if we can, if we can get a report from the mayor and find out what we're really doing, because if we're going to, if the thought of the mayor's thought is to overhaul this and this is everybody's wish, that's great, but why put anything into it and do something twice?

475
00:35:54,808 --> 00:35:56,529
So that's, that's my only concern.

476
00:35:57,090 --> 00:36:06,177
So as amended by council Scott Pelly, that the mayor report to the city council as to her intentions on dealing with the parking program.

477
00:36:06,558 --> 00:36:06,838
Thank you.

478
00:36:07,857 --> 00:36:09,778
Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

479
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,760
Thank you, Mr. President.

480
00:36:13,721 --> 00:36:15,402
I also agree with Councilor Scarpelli.

481
00:36:15,442 --> 00:36:27,489
I think a report from the administration is a great idea, but what I would also like to see is with regard to this resolution, it'd be interesting to see, you know, how much, how much does a single meter cost?

482
00:36:27,730 --> 00:36:35,314
I mean, if we could get some cost figures from this city with regard to how much single meters cost, I mean, we have kiosks that we purchased.

483
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:36,075
I mean,

484
00:36:37,325 --> 00:36:51,714
I mean, even though I might not like the kiosk program, maybe something that if we sell them back, can we, I mean, I hate the sense, uh, this money that should be going to the, each of the individual squares, it'd be nice to actually use it for something other than parking.

485
00:36:52,475 --> 00:36:57,017
And, um, so it would be nice if you can get some sort of cost estimates back from the city with regard to, um,

486
00:36:58,532 --> 00:37:00,774
if we could, how much the single head meters would cost.

487
00:37:00,834 --> 00:37:07,500
And, um, if the kiosks could be, I don't know, sold to another city, that's maybe using the site, same type of program.

488
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:14,546
Um, I definitely would like to use the money for the purpose that it was originally planned for.

489
00:37:14,666 --> 00:37:18,389
So, um, if we could get those numbers back from the administration, that'd be great.

490
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:19,009
Thank you.

491
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:26,716
On the motion for approval offered by Councilor Caviello, amended by Councilors Scarpelli and Falco, Madam Vice President.

492
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:27,240
Thank you.

493
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:30,703
President DelaRusso, I think Councilor Falcook read my mind.

494
00:37:30,943 --> 00:37:32,785
Just a little more discussion needs to be had.

495
00:37:33,305 --> 00:37:35,487
My question was, how much is each single head meter?

496
00:37:35,907 --> 00:37:42,512
And my question along with that is, I know after 10 years we're going to own the meters, but as of right now, it's almost like we are leasing them.

497
00:37:42,672 --> 00:37:49,778
So, you know, when we are we selling these, would we be selling the machines that are out there now back to Republic?

498
00:37:50,498 --> 00:37:51,900
We'd own the single head meters.

499
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,581
So I think this is just a number of

500
00:37:54,062 --> 00:38:08,170
calculations that need to be done, and I agree with Councilor Schiappelli, just to the whole conversation about the whole entire program, whether that's in the Committee of the Whole with the Mayor, just to see, you know, get her feedback, see where we're going with this and how we're going to improve it on multiple levels.

501
00:38:09,310 --> 00:38:15,514
And thank you to Councilor Carviel for bringing the discussion forward, but I think a number of different things need to be discussed.

502
00:38:15,534 --> 00:38:15,774
Mr. President.

503
00:38:17,115 --> 00:38:17,655
Mr. President.

504
00:38:18,335 --> 00:38:18,976
Councilor Carviel.

505
00:38:19,576 --> 00:38:21,397
About four weeks ago, we had asked for a discussion

506
00:38:22,122 --> 00:38:25,183
with Republic Parking and they have not come forward.

507
00:38:27,624 --> 00:38:29,144
So maybe we should ask them again.

508
00:38:29,164 --> 00:38:31,125
Do you want to continue, Madam Vice President?

509
00:38:31,725 --> 00:38:33,286
No, I think I was finished speaking.

510
00:38:33,326 --> 00:38:43,890
I think we should definitely have a committee meeting and get the mayor's input and see where she's going and get some facts and figures so we can know how this will impact the entire situation.

511
00:38:43,910 --> 00:38:44,990
Awesome.

512
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:48,071
Councilor, Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

513
00:38:49,492 --> 00:38:50,412
Thank you, Mr. President.

514
00:38:51,153 --> 00:39:03,161
The last number I heard, if we were to go to meters and do away with the kiosk, was the city would have to put up about $800,000 to $1 million, because Councilor Longo-Kern is right.

515
00:39:04,322 --> 00:39:08,185
Over, I believe it's a 10-year span, we'll eventually own the kiosk.

516
00:39:08,465 --> 00:39:10,206
But at this point, we don't own the kiosk.

517
00:39:11,026 --> 00:39:20,673
So to revert back to meters, which, by the way, I wholeheartedly support, and I'm having deja vu, because back some

518
00:39:21,157 --> 00:39:32,384
Four or five years ago, the committee I sat on, that the mayor appointed, then Mayor McGlynn, our recommendation was to put meters on the street and kiosks in the parking lots.

519
00:39:33,285 --> 00:39:46,273
Now that was back four or five years ago, the recommendation, and the mayor at the time didn't like how meters looked on the streets, and he decided to go off and do kiosks altogether.

520
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,754
So it would be helpful,

521
00:39:48,848 --> 00:39:52,331
I'd rather have a meeting than to get just a correspondence back from the mayor.

522
00:39:53,052 --> 00:40:02,780
I think it's appropriate that there's all these different transition committees out there going around, meeting with neighbors and the business district and everything else.

523
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:11,467
And we have yet really to sit down with the mayor to discuss anything other than what the mayor wanted to present to us a couple of weeks ago.

524
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:12,488
And that was it.

525
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:17,112
It was a one-way conversation, which is not an effective way to communicate.

526
00:40:17,651 --> 00:40:35,077
But needless to say, Mr. Mayor, Mr. President, that... Needless to say, I think it would be more fruitful if we had a meeting to sit down with the mayor and discuss some of these issues.

527
00:40:35,418 --> 00:40:42,940
We've all been around, we've all listened to the businesses and the residents, and why not invite us to a meeting and say, hey, what are your thoughts?

528
00:40:43,481 --> 00:40:47,242
Rather than the mayor go off and do something on her own and then come back and say,

529
00:40:47,648 --> 00:40:53,170
Well, that's the direction the council gave me, similar to what Mike McGlynn did to us back a couple of years ago.

530
00:40:53,190 --> 00:41:01,552
You know, he tried to bring us in after the fact, after he made all the decisions, he tried to bring us in and say this is what the council was supportive of.

531
00:41:01,892 --> 00:41:10,754
So why not have a fresh new start with this new mayor and bring us in ahead of time and let us give some input and some suggestions.

532
00:41:11,895 --> 00:41:16,716
Chief Sacker was at meetings we had, this is going back some years ago,

533
00:41:17,250 --> 00:41:26,695
But I believe at the time, a double-headed meter, which was more cost effective, installed was about anywhere from $600 to $800 for a double-headed meter.

534
00:41:27,375 --> 00:41:31,057
And that was from Pacquiao or one of the particular larger vendors.

535
00:41:31,477 --> 00:41:32,837
And prices may have changed.

536
00:41:32,898 --> 00:41:35,059
I know technology has changed over the years.

537
00:41:35,899 --> 00:41:41,542
So $100,000 to do every meter in the city is far short of the mark.

538
00:41:42,502 --> 00:41:44,843
So I don't think $100,000 would be enough.

539
00:41:45,143 --> 00:41:46,344
And we'd also have to look at,

540
00:41:47,165 --> 00:41:57,070
the additional $800,000 to $1,000,000 to actually get out of the contract that we have right now with Republic.

541
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:59,070
So I think it's a worthy suggestion.

542
00:41:59,351 --> 00:42:06,394
And I would ask, Mr. President, rather than a correspondence, that we have a meeting with the mayor to discuss parking in this city.

543
00:42:10,355 --> 00:42:11,616
Mr. President, thank you very much.

544
00:42:11,676 --> 00:42:14,197
And thank you to Councilor Caviello for bringing this initiative forward.

545
00:42:14,942 --> 00:42:16,343
I can certainly understand why he's done it.

546
00:42:16,503 --> 00:42:21,905
The program's been in place now for a year, and we've made a lot of requests, and we've asked for a lot of different things, and we've seen some inaction.

547
00:42:21,945 --> 00:42:23,786
So I can certainly appreciate where he's coming from.

548
00:42:24,686 --> 00:42:33,049
However, I would agree with Councilor Mox that I think a meeting would be more beneficial, more productive, and quite frankly, get us all on the same page.

549
00:42:33,649 --> 00:42:39,932
So in looking at the matter that's before us this evening, Mr. President, I think it's safe to say that we're not going to have any consensus tonight, which is fine.

550
00:42:39,972 --> 00:42:43,193
So I would motion that the matter be referred to a committee of the whole between the administration

551
00:42:43,718 --> 00:43:00,093
for public parking in the council to do an annual review of the last year, the first year of implementation, and to discuss the pros and cons, the complaints that we've received, so on and so forth, and then maybe help shape a new plan going forward as to what's going to work best for Medford, Mr. President.

552
00:43:00,113 --> 00:43:04,957
So I would recommend that we go to subcommittee and concur with Councilor Moxon and Councilor Longo-Kern on this matter.

553
00:43:05,497 --> 00:43:07,799
And I would make that a motion.

554
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:08,720
Very good.

555
00:43:09,481 --> 00:43:10,702
As amended by Councilor Knight.

556
00:43:11,715 --> 00:43:18,838
On the motion, main motion for approval as amended by Councilors Scarpelli, Falco, Markson, Knight, Councilor Caraviello.

557
00:43:18,858 --> 00:43:19,718
Thank you, Mr. President.

558
00:43:19,958 --> 00:43:24,580
My intent was not to throw away the kiosks and give them back.

559
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:34,583
My intent was just to do the main roads of the business districts and reposition those kiosks in different parts of the city, in different areas.

560
00:43:35,844 --> 00:43:39,205
I don't think anybody was buying them from us or taking them back.

561
00:43:39,858 --> 00:43:42,582
just to move them to different areas, maybe a little closer in some spots.

562
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:46,527
And just put the meters on the main road of the business area.

563
00:43:47,809 --> 00:43:53,076
And I have no problem sending this to either committee of the whole or subcommittee for discussion, Mr. President.

564
00:44:09,533 --> 00:44:09,873
go ahead.

565
00:44:09,933 --> 00:44:10,514
I apologize.

566
00:44:10,994 --> 00:44:12,314
We had to clarify what was said.

567
00:44:12,735 --> 00:44:14,656
Please state your name, address for the record and welcome.

568
00:44:15,276 --> 00:44:15,716
Thank you.

569
00:44:15,776 --> 00:44:18,358
Joyce Paul, a Mason street, Medford mass.

570
00:44:18,578 --> 00:44:24,401
And I just wanted to say, um, when we make a contract, when the city makes a contract, I'd like it to benefit the city.

571
00:44:25,061 --> 00:44:33,145
And this contract, I understand 65% of the money goes to a company that is in Tennessee.

572
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:35,926
And to me, that doesn't sound like a really good deal.

573
00:44:36,047 --> 00:44:38,908
I think there must be somebody in Massachusetts that could,

574
00:44:39,874 --> 00:44:40,874
do the same thing.

575
00:44:41,254 --> 00:44:48,076
And I think we would, I'd like to, you know, look at benefiting us if that's what we're, if that's what the contract is for.

576
00:44:48,536 --> 00:44:49,177
Thank you.

577
00:44:49,237 --> 00:44:50,077
Thank you very much.

578
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:50,937
Good evening.

579
00:44:50,977 --> 00:44:51,357
Welcome.

580
00:44:51,417 --> 00:44:53,058
Please state your name and address for the record.

581
00:44:53,638 --> 00:44:55,578
Nick Tomazook, 29 Garfield left.

582
00:44:56,498 --> 00:44:58,879
Uh, maybe I missed it or what?

583
00:44:59,539 --> 00:45:01,200
What is this from the meters?

584
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:06,021
Where's that money going to go to, to the city or to that parking Nazi?

585
00:45:10,948 --> 00:45:12,249
Or whatever, Republic is it?

586
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,632
I'm sorry, I haven't really followed up on that contract.

587
00:45:16,033 --> 00:45:18,154
But who's the money going to go to from the meters?

588
00:45:20,957 --> 00:45:21,737
The parking company?

589
00:45:22,258 --> 00:45:23,439
And we have to pay for the meters?

590
00:45:24,740 --> 00:45:28,043
Are they absorbing any cost at all of the meters?

591
00:45:32,046 --> 00:45:33,528
Right, they're doing the enforcement.

592
00:45:33,928 --> 00:45:37,171
Now we have to provide them with the tools to enforce it?

593
00:45:39,822 --> 00:45:42,143
Well, that's what I was saying, is where's that money going to go to?

594
00:45:43,044 --> 00:45:46,665
If we're paying for the meters and then they're going to collect the money.

595
00:45:48,546 --> 00:45:50,087
Okay.

596
00:45:50,107 --> 00:46:01,512
That contract's been so messed up, but you know, things have changed and it seems like the city's pumping money into it and they're just sitting back and collecting the money.

597
00:46:04,033 --> 00:46:06,335
They had to improve the cameras because they couldn't see them.

598
00:46:06,455 --> 00:46:07,095
We'll pay for that.

599
00:46:08,901 --> 00:46:16,223
I mean, we're loading lots of money into this program that you're not getting a return on, that you should be getting.

600
00:46:18,303 --> 00:46:23,464
If you can't read a screen, the city shouldn't have to pay for the new screens.

601
00:46:24,225 --> 00:46:25,645
They should have to pay for the new screens.

602
00:46:28,586 --> 00:46:31,806
So if they want to change the screens next month, are we going to pay for it again?

603
00:46:34,807 --> 00:46:36,067
There's got to be a stop somewhere.

604
00:46:36,687 --> 00:46:38,128
You know, the buck's got to stop somewhere.

605
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,481
And when you put these meters in, they're going to say, hey, we want all the money.

606
00:46:45,381 --> 00:46:46,381
And you're going to get your 35%.

607
00:46:48,922 --> 00:46:51,223
But you have to incur the cost of the meters.

608
00:46:52,763 --> 00:46:54,583
They should have to incur some kind of cost.

609
00:46:55,544 --> 00:47:05,686
If I go through a set of brick steps in your house, am I going to ask you to pay for the trowel, for the bucket, for the mortar, for the, you know, for the shovel?

610
00:47:08,456 --> 00:47:11,818
Yeah, but the thing of it is, is you're asking for the money to pay for the meters.

611
00:47:12,659 --> 00:47:14,220
Where's the money going to go from the meters?

612
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:15,421
Are you only going to get a 35% return on it?

613
00:47:15,441 --> 00:47:19,064
Well, that's why I'm asking the question.

614
00:47:19,084 --> 00:47:21,205
Point of information, Vice President Longo-Curran.

615
00:47:21,225 --> 00:47:22,786
Thank you, President DeLaRusso.

616
00:47:23,266 --> 00:47:28,310
Nick, I think that's why we're asking for a committee the whole meeting, because your question makes complete sense.

617
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:31,252
And I think that's where Council Fapo and Marks and I were coming from.

618
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:33,594
You know, who's going to pay for these meters?

619
00:47:33,894 --> 00:47:35,215
Obviously, maybe the city would.

620
00:47:35,657 --> 00:47:39,939
would we get reimbursement for the meters that we gave back to them that are currently there now?

621
00:47:40,239 --> 00:47:43,801
I think that's all the questions that we need answered before we just go and buy single head meters.

622
00:47:44,062 --> 00:47:54,347
Because the contract would have to be changed, terms would have to be agreed upon, because obviously Mayor Burke is fiscally responsible and isn't going to give up funds that should be the city's.

623
00:47:54,607 --> 00:47:55,528
Because I saw the enforcement car.

624
00:47:55,548 --> 00:47:58,089
Thank you for that clarification, Madam Vice President.

625
00:47:58,669 --> 00:48:00,010
I saw the enforcement car.

626
00:48:00,050 --> 00:48:02,171
All they did was put a magnetic sign on the door.

627
00:48:03,072 --> 00:48:03,392
Thank you.

628
00:48:04,194 --> 00:48:05,494
That's not part of the enforcement.

629
00:48:05,514 --> 00:48:08,695
Good evening.

630
00:48:08,815 --> 00:48:10,596
Please state your name and address for the record.

631
00:48:11,256 --> 00:48:12,296
Thank you, Mr. President.

632
00:48:12,536 --> 00:48:14,577
Uh, Rob Capucci, 71 Evans street.

633
00:48:15,017 --> 00:48:28,860
Uh, really brief in this meeting that's coming up, uh, possible, uh, question, uh, the meters we don't have to pay after six o'clock, but I've, I've noticed many times parking around the city.

634
00:48:29,405 --> 00:48:36,248
that I know there's signage for it, but the signs kind of blend into one another and a lot of people don't notice.

635
00:48:36,668 --> 00:48:46,493
And many times, I've been walking down the street or parking after six, and I see people pumping money into the meters at 6.15, 6.30, seven o'clock at night.

636
00:48:48,874 --> 00:48:56,958
If there was a way to perhaps make these meters either shut down or not take money after six o'clock,

637
00:48:57,441 --> 00:49:09,546
If that's possible with Republic in any meetings that you have, that would probably save a lot of citizens some money that they don't need to be paying after 6 o'clock.

638
00:49:09,606 --> 00:49:10,486
Thank you, Mr. President.

639
00:49:10,506 --> 00:49:11,407
Thank you very much.

640
00:49:12,767 --> 00:49:13,508
Good evening, sir.

641
00:49:13,668 --> 00:49:14,048
Welcome.

642
00:49:14,068 --> 00:49:15,688
Please state your name and address for the record.

643
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:18,169
Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, and I've been masked.

644
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,350
I'm a member of this council.

645
00:49:19,710 --> 00:49:24,352
One of the things I think you really need to be concerned about is the annual report that just came out by Republic.

646
00:49:24,955 --> 00:49:27,776
They indicated that they did just a little bit over a million dollars.

647
00:49:27,956 --> 00:49:30,936
Their intention was to do about a million eight for their first year.

648
00:49:31,256 --> 00:49:38,638
Now they're blaming a bad winter, they're blaming the Kratik Bridge, they're blaming a whole host of other issues as to why they didn't receive that and generate the money.

649
00:49:39,558 --> 00:49:50,741
If that doesn't tell you that they're going to go on a very aggressive ticketing here in the city of Medford, something is going to tell you that, because they're not going to be out here not to make money.

650
00:49:51,327 --> 00:49:55,108
You know, the fact of the matter is that we only got $30,000 this year from them.

651
00:49:55,568 --> 00:49:59,849
I believe we're getting another $230,000 from fines and we're getting another $250,000.

652
00:50:00,269 --> 00:50:03,049
Um, on the, it's an annual payment.

653
00:50:03,109 --> 00:50:04,950
It's not a one time annual thing.

654
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:06,470
It's $250,000 annually.

655
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:08,490
That's supposed to go back to the cities and towns.

656
00:50:08,930 --> 00:50:14,091
So that probably only generated about $560,000 here to the city of Medford for this past year.

657
00:50:14,111 --> 00:50:15,952
But that included fines and that included the two 50.

658
00:50:17,072 --> 00:50:17,732
So the actual,

659
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:43,101
Revenue was only $30,000 because they never even got anywheres near the million eight It wasn't supposed to be a revenue enhancer, but the present mayor calls it a revenue turnover I I don't know how it's a revenue turnover if it's not a revenue enhancer Because if you're turning over more cars allegedly people are going to take the spots and pay more money no matter how you look at it It's a revenue enhancer council marks.

660
00:50:43,121 --> 00:50:45,922
We can go back to 2009 when the report was submitted here

661
00:50:46,430 --> 00:50:49,513
which you and the chief and other members of this community served upon it, and you're right.

662
00:50:50,313 --> 00:50:54,797
The first thing was to have revenue traffic enforcement.

663
00:50:54,877 --> 00:51:01,843
And on the last page, the priority of the committee was to have single head meters or double head meters, you know, throughout the community.

664
00:51:01,863 --> 00:51:06,867
That was the easiest and common sense way for people to understand what they would have to pay for when they're parking.

665
00:51:07,888 --> 00:51:09,089
And we don't see that right now.

666
00:51:09,709 --> 00:51:12,612
And I think if you just continue to go on and you realize,

667
00:51:13,087 --> 00:51:17,269
that if you're going to change the contract, the contract is very specific as it states.

668
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:21,311
If any changes to the kiosk take place, the city of Medford has to pay for that.

669
00:51:21,812 --> 00:51:27,655
So whether you buy these doublehead or singlehead meters, it's going to have to be negotiated.

670
00:51:27,675 --> 00:51:28,935
I know your city solicitor is here.

671
00:51:29,256 --> 00:51:30,676
It's going to have to be negotiated too.

672
00:51:30,856 --> 00:51:34,979
But the fact of the matter is, they didn't get anywhere near the $1 million that they were looking for.

673
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:41,142
So you're going to probably see a very aggressive movement right now by Republic as it relates to this.

674
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:43,636
Let me tell you an experience I had this afternoon.

675
00:51:43,656 --> 00:51:48,298
I was in Medford Square with one of the people from Republic, a gentleman who was very kind and very courteous.

676
00:51:48,759 --> 00:51:55,962
And he watched two particular people, one gentleman in particular, who parked his car maybe six cars away from the kiosk.

677
00:51:56,322 --> 00:51:59,604
He drove by, didn't even see the kiosk, and just went along his way.

678
00:52:00,004 --> 00:52:02,286
He was stopped, and he was told he had to put the money in the kiosk.

679
00:52:02,306 --> 00:52:03,366
He said he didn't even know.

680
00:52:03,866 --> 00:52:10,830
And if you have an SUV or other type of vehicle that's there, when you're driving by and you don't see it, and if you don't come from the city of Medford and you don't see it,

681
00:52:11,224 --> 00:52:12,605
You know, you're just going to be subject to that.

682
00:52:13,026 --> 00:52:20,272
And another one was, somebody just mentioned it, I think Mr. Capucci, if the screen is very light and you can't read it and you can't see it.

683
00:52:20,572 --> 00:52:33,224
I think it was you, Councilor Caviello, who brought this up way back in January of 2015 as one of the first arguments that you had against Republic was the fact that the matter of these kiosks were very hard to read, especially when the sun is hitting on them.

684
00:52:33,264 --> 00:52:35,806
And if you're a senior citizen, it's making it even worse.

685
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:40,796
There's a cost factor that the republic is going to have to address and it should not be on the city side.

686
00:52:41,396 --> 00:52:56,065
But I would, if in fact you have to go forward any further with this whole program for which I would be totally opposed to, I believe the meters would be a better way of representing common sense to a person having to park and having to put money in it.

687
00:52:56,505 --> 00:53:02,849
But more importantly, I think the city can find itself in a negotiating point as it relates to where they would want to go with this.

688
00:53:02,909 --> 00:53:03,349
Remember that $250,000.

689
00:53:05,312 --> 00:53:07,854
by Mayor McGlynn, former Mayor McGlynn, was very specific.

690
00:53:08,295 --> 00:53:12,719
It was to be used specifically for the business districts here in the city of Medford.

691
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:21,967
And to use it for any other purpose for which would serve hopefully a better purpose for people in the business districts, I think that's gonna have to be a negotiated tool.

692
00:53:22,587 --> 00:53:25,870
On the motion approved by Councilor Caraviello as amended.

693
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:26,971
All those in favor?

694
00:53:27,352 --> 00:53:29,774
All those opposed?

695
00:53:29,794 --> 00:53:30,835
Motion carries.

696
00:53:30,855 --> 00:53:32,236
16-321 offered by Councilor Caraviello.

697
00:53:32,764 --> 00:53:46,115
Be it resolved that legislation House Bill 463 and Senate Bill 312 to provide early screening and appropriate instruction of students with dyslexia is supported by the Medford City Council.

698
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:52,460
This legislation is supported by representatives Donato and Garbali.

699
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,404
Nancy Duggan will say a few words in regards to this legislation.

700
00:53:57,784 --> 00:53:58,825
Councilor Caviello.

701
00:54:01,769 --> 00:54:11,378
Sex here is a neurobiological condition and it starts in children and affects how they learn to write, read and write later on in life.

702
00:54:11,398 --> 00:54:17,063
Part of this bill is to provide early screening for these students.

703
00:54:18,504 --> 00:54:21,486
So this is found earlier in their lives.

704
00:54:21,547 --> 00:54:24,549
And I spoke to Nancy about it, I think she's here in the audience.

705
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:27,952
And I think she'll clarify a little bit better.

706
00:54:29,825 --> 00:54:32,226
Ma'am, please state your name and address for the record.

707
00:54:32,286 --> 00:54:32,686
Welcome.

708
00:54:33,366 --> 00:54:36,947
Hi, I'm Nancy Rasso-Duggan, and I'm from 36 Warren Street in Medford.

709
00:54:37,327 --> 00:54:40,768
I also represent a statewide group called Decoding Dyslexia.

710
00:54:41,228 --> 00:54:52,331
It's parents, neuroscientists, developmental pediatricians, speech and language therapists, and families who have a history of dyslexia and are trying to get this type of legislation passed.

711
00:54:54,012 --> 00:55:12,843
One of the benefits, as Councilor Caviello mentioned, is that early screening is part of the legislation, and currently in Massachusetts we screen for vision and hearing and posture, and we didn't in the past have the ability to screen for dyslexia because it's somewhat of an invisible disability.

712
00:55:13,463 --> 00:55:27,613
But now the research and the information is out there through the great institutions in Massachusetts, like Children's Hospital and Massachusetts Institute of Technology has a brain and research center, and they've done a lot of research on this.

713
00:55:28,114 --> 00:55:29,475
It's a simple process.

714
00:55:29,955 --> 00:55:32,157
It's very easily done in less than 20 minutes.

715
00:55:32,557 --> 00:55:40,363
So the current legislation would really benefit probably about two students in every classroom that would have this disability.

716
00:55:40,663 --> 00:55:42,945
It's a very widespread disability.

717
00:55:43,465 --> 00:55:53,992
And so instead of the current model where we wait for kids, we recognize kids that are struggling to read, and by about second or third grade, we start to provide different interventions.

718
00:55:54,052 --> 00:55:59,055
Sometimes they even get interventions sooner, but not specific to the actual disability.

719
00:55:59,495 --> 00:56:10,462
So if we could screen when kids, they call it school onset, when kids come to school as we do for vision and for hearing and for posture, that would be a benefit to these students.

720
00:56:10,562 --> 00:56:10,882
Thank you.

721
00:56:11,935 --> 00:56:13,436
Thank you very much, Nancy.

722
00:56:13,877 --> 00:56:15,838
Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

723
00:56:16,258 --> 00:56:17,179
Thank you, Mr. President.

724
00:56:17,419 --> 00:56:19,421
Um, I support this a hundred percent.

725
00:56:19,601 --> 00:56:21,322
I have a family members.

726
00:56:21,382 --> 00:56:29,269
I have friends who have kids that have dyslexia and, uh, cannot even stress the importance of early detection.

727
00:56:29,769 --> 00:56:39,677
Um, you know, you hear, I know being on the school committee previously, you know, you talk to so many parents and, um, you know, real nightmare is when a child goes undiagnosed for

728
00:56:40,564 --> 00:56:45,005
And they get to the fourth grade, and all of a sudden, they find out the child has dyslexia.

729
00:56:45,286 --> 00:56:54,508
And to try to unravel that, get back to the point where you're starting to teach reading again in the fourth grade, that's really tough on the child, on the family.

730
00:56:55,129 --> 00:56:57,069
And so early detection is the key.

731
00:56:57,429 --> 00:56:59,330
And I support this 100%.

732
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:02,751
I'm glad that Councilor Caviello brought this before us tonight.

733
00:57:02,971 --> 00:57:04,812
And I support it.

734
00:57:05,052 --> 00:57:05,332
Thank you.

735
00:57:05,352 --> 00:57:05,612
Thank you.

736
00:57:06,152 --> 00:57:06,472
Excellent.

737
00:57:06,932 --> 00:57:08,093
Councilor Caviello.

738
00:57:08,113 --> 00:57:09,033
Mr. President.

739
00:57:10,337 --> 00:57:16,998
I would ask that this be sent to Senator Jalen and Representative Barber for their support also.

740
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,339
As amended by Councilor Caffiello.

741
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:21,139
Councilor Knight.

742
00:57:22,019 --> 00:57:25,660
Yes, Mr. President, I do have one question through you to the sponsor of this resolution.

743
00:57:26,260 --> 00:57:29,941
Are House Bill 463 and Senate Bill 312 the exact same language?

744
00:57:31,301 --> 00:57:31,641
No, they're not.

745
00:57:32,062 --> 00:57:32,402
They're not.

746
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:33,722
Can you explain the differences, Ms.

747
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:34,362
Duggan, if you don't mind?

748
00:57:35,186 --> 00:57:37,937
And which version would your organization prefer to see?

749
00:57:37,977 --> 00:57:40,889
What do you think would be the best fit for Massachusetts and Medford?

750
00:57:41,823 --> 00:58:04,875
Currently, the two bills are in the, it's a joint committee, so there's a Senate bill and a House bill, and the House bill is specific to screening, early screening, and it would coincide with, I think, Section, Chapter 57, Section 71 or something, the same law that does the screening for hearing and vision, basically.

751
00:58:05,455 --> 00:58:09,599
The Senate side has some more detailed description.

752
00:58:09,679 --> 00:58:16,525
It actually suggests that we accept the scientific definition of dyslexia, which we also would support that.

753
00:58:17,346 --> 00:58:25,152
They would like us to use the International Dyslexia Association's definition or the National Institute of Health's definition.

754
00:58:25,192 --> 00:58:26,433
They're both the same definition.

755
00:58:28,395 --> 00:58:35,841
It seems obvious that there would be a scientific definition, but they're recommending that it be part of the legislation.

756
00:58:38,576 --> 00:58:41,398
The Senate also has the interventions.

757
00:58:41,458 --> 00:58:45,059
They're more specific and more detailed about how to do the interventions.

758
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,201
So we would also support that.

759
00:58:47,521 --> 00:58:52,343
But my understanding is that if it comes out of the committee, it will come out revised.

760
00:58:52,383 --> 00:59:02,529
Because there was a hearing, there was a public hearing, and there's been quite a bit of professional testimony from those researchers at MIT and Boston Children's and different places.

761
00:59:02,909 --> 00:59:08,012
So my understanding is they'll come out as sort of a combined dyslexia legislation.

762
00:59:08,772 --> 00:59:13,295
And, Mr. President, through you to the Speaker, Mr. President, what goes into a screening?

763
00:59:14,075 --> 00:59:15,156
How long does the process take?

764
00:59:15,216 --> 00:59:24,741
I mean, I think we're all familiar when, you know, we went down to the Brooks School and they made us look through those glasses and follow the apple around or raise your left hand and your right hand when you heard the beeps and stand up against the wall in gym class when they checked your spine.

765
00:59:25,442 --> 00:59:27,743
What goes into – do they still do that?

766
00:59:28,568 --> 00:59:30,472
I'm sorry, physical education.

767
00:59:30,492 --> 00:59:32,656
My father's yelling at the TV right now as he's sitting at home.

768
00:59:33,738 --> 00:59:36,303
But if you could explain maybe a little bit as to what goes into the process.

769
00:59:40,682 --> 00:59:47,348
would be done, like right now, as this gentleman referenced, we do discover or find them by third grade.

770
00:59:47,749 --> 00:59:58,078
The screening is very similar, except for instead of doing it in third grade, we have discovered that there are certain activities that you can do at age five that are just as accurate.

771
00:59:58,098 --> 01:00:03,583
In fact, they may be even more accurate because the child hasn't already learned some other things and they can find them.

772
01:00:03,984 --> 01:00:05,525
So typically in schools,

773
01:00:07,665 --> 01:00:09,206
You do like a kindergarten screening.

774
01:00:09,986 --> 01:00:19,609
And some of the activities like rhyming, letter knowledge, and something called rapid automatized naming, which are very simply done in about 20 minutes.

775
01:00:20,549 --> 01:00:21,670
The study from MIT.

776
01:00:23,235 --> 01:00:24,875
was done throughout Massachusetts.

777
01:00:24,915 --> 01:00:36,598
And in fact, I think some schools in Medford participated in the study, where MIT professionals helped teachers use the normal tools that they would use anyway.

778
01:00:36,658 --> 01:00:43,380
In other words, most schools already understand how to measure something called phonemic awareness or rapid automatized naming.

779
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,561
And they were just made aware of if you do this at age five.

780
01:00:47,021 --> 01:00:54,402
and it hits a certain criteria, then we know with 87 percent accuracy that that child will fail to read by third grade.

781
01:00:55,042 --> 01:00:58,203
It was 87 percent accurate in about 20 minutes.

782
01:00:58,783 --> 01:01:09,785
So you could predict in this long term, it was a five-year study funded by the National Institute of Health, and they were very surprised at how accurate and how simple the study was.

783
01:01:10,005 --> 01:01:11,905
So that's what they're proposing.

784
01:01:12,886 --> 01:01:14,706
Mr. President, I don't think you can argue with those numbers.

785
01:01:15,257 --> 01:01:15,857
That's for sure.

786
01:01:16,077 --> 01:01:20,800
Um, I'm in full support of this resolution and, uh, I would move approval on the motion for approval.

787
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:22,921
Chair recognizes council marks.

788
01:01:23,641 --> 01:01:24,862
Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

789
01:01:24,882 --> 01:01:28,443
And, uh, I know her as Nancy Razzo.

790
01:01:28,503 --> 01:01:36,167
So, uh, Nancy, um, are there currently any districts and school districts in Massachusetts that are doing the early screening?

791
01:01:40,917 --> 01:01:48,201
I'm not one of the researchers, but there were either 129 or 159 schools that participated in the original study.

792
01:01:48,661 --> 01:01:54,384
And it's my understanding that even though the study was over, they were all like, this is awesome, and we're going to do this.

793
01:01:55,705 --> 01:02:06,991
I believe that Carver, Mass, and the town of Weston recently has already said, well, we're going to adopt this anyway.

794
01:02:08,472 --> 01:02:11,633
But I don't have a poll of every single town.

795
01:02:12,433 --> 01:02:18,714
Oh, in Amherst, actually, Amherst, Massachusetts, they also, I think, have a screening protocol.

796
01:02:18,754 --> 01:02:30,737
Based on the statistics, I think it might be worthwhile for us to send also, in addition to supporting both the House and Senate bill, something to the school committee, as well as the superintendent of schools, to have them look into it.

797
01:02:31,397 --> 01:02:33,178
Because I think your numbers do bear out.

798
01:02:34,918 --> 01:02:37,559
If I could just ask, the House bill and the Senate bill,

799
01:02:38,995 --> 01:02:41,857
How long have they been filed with the state legislature?

800
01:02:41,917 --> 01:02:42,417
How many years?

801
01:02:43,418 --> 01:02:45,158
Well, it's a two-year session.

802
01:02:45,399 --> 01:02:48,640
So we started to lobby in 2013.

803
01:02:49,701 --> 01:02:52,843
Like I said, we're a collaboration with some experts and researchers.

804
01:02:53,443 --> 01:02:57,145
And they just entered, I guess, last January, the cycle.

805
01:02:57,185 --> 01:02:59,386
I'm not a lobbyist, so I hope I'm saying this correctly.

806
01:02:59,426 --> 01:03:02,588
But in January, they entered the legislation.

807
01:03:03,048 --> 01:03:05,749
In June, June 17th, we had the hearing.

808
01:03:08,811 --> 01:03:15,036
Now it's been in the committee, and there's some discussion of how to word it and how to get it to come together.

809
01:03:15,696 --> 01:03:17,478
And it's been extended.

810
01:03:17,538 --> 01:03:26,365
So usually there's a rule in Massachusetts where it would have been reported out already, but it has until June 3rd to report out because they're trying to get the language precise.

811
01:03:27,225 --> 01:03:46,408
One of the other things that I didn't mention is that we're hoping it will come out, it is not in the legislation now, but we are hoping that they will come out with a task force so that these researchers and experts and families could talk with educators and decide what the plan of action would be so they'd be like a handbook or some guide so you wouldn't just say,

812
01:03:47,269 --> 01:03:49,930
Okay, everybody screen and not really have.

813
01:03:49,950 --> 01:04:04,938
And I think that's what the delay is to make sure that we equip our educators, not only with the information about that screening's effective, but how to do it and how to be supported so that they can go forward.

814
01:04:05,758 --> 01:04:09,800
Do you know if the bill includes any type of funding, state funding?

815
01:04:11,428 --> 01:04:18,911
It does not, because, well, maybe they'll come up with something, but theoretically, it doesn't cost anything to accept the definition.

816
01:04:19,831 --> 01:04:28,615
The screening tools most schools would have anyway, and it would just be an education

817
01:04:29,703 --> 01:04:37,110
factor of getting everybody on board, so there'd probably be some kind of time, so they would give time to the schools to figure out how they're going to do the screening.

818
01:04:37,511 --> 01:04:46,219
For instance, in one school you might use something called the Gold Star Kindergarten Screening, which does include phonemic awareness and RAN.

819
01:04:46,299 --> 01:04:53,086
And another school might buy something called AIMSwebs, you know, because different districts have their own way to screen their kindergartners.

820
01:04:53,686 --> 01:05:00,676
And so they would just have to have time to figure out, you know, which screening tool are we using and who's going to be responsible?

821
01:05:00,776 --> 01:05:03,540
Is it the kindergarten teachers or the first grade teachers?

822
01:05:04,221 --> 01:05:08,247
And do you know if it covers both parochial schools as well with private schools?

823
01:05:09,711 --> 01:05:13,013
That, I think it's a public school situation.

824
01:05:13,073 --> 01:05:21,756
I know that with most disability rights issues, private schools usually follow suit if they can.

825
01:05:22,917 --> 01:05:28,840
They would because they usually follow the ADA laws and IDEA laws.

826
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,101
because you have equal access.

827
01:05:31,382 --> 01:05:38,449
Once it's accepted as a disability, and it is a disability under IDEA, it's really just an awareness.

828
01:05:38,750 --> 01:05:48,180
If people understood how effective this screening is and it's new, theoretically, we already have the obligation to do that under the Federal Child Find Act.

829
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:54,723
We're just informing people that there's a better, more effective, newer way to find them.

830
01:05:55,163 --> 01:05:58,685
And instead of finding them in third or fourth grade, we can find them in kindergarten.

831
01:05:59,185 --> 01:06:01,086
So that law sort of already exists.

832
01:06:01,226 --> 01:06:02,507
This just brings awareness.

833
01:06:03,187 --> 01:06:03,647
That's great.

834
01:06:03,667 --> 01:06:04,748
Thanks for your time.

835
01:06:04,788 --> 01:06:10,311
Mr. President, if we could just amend it to send that communication to the school committee as well as the superintendent of schools.

836
01:06:11,591 --> 01:06:18,435
On the motion of Councilor Caviello with the second for approval by Councilor Knight as amended.

837
01:06:18,794 --> 01:06:20,596
Chair recognizes Vice President Longo Kern.

838
01:06:20,896 --> 01:06:21,917
Thank you, President Del Rosso.

839
01:06:21,937 --> 01:06:23,698
Just two quick questions, if you don't mind.

840
01:06:24,819 --> 01:06:33,347
Does this, I think the first has been answered, this mandates that every kindergartner be screened, not just those who may, the teachers may feel are at risk?

841
01:06:34,247 --> 01:06:36,089
Yes, it would screen every kindergartner.

842
01:06:36,489 --> 01:06:38,051
And would they be screened by the kids?

843
01:06:38,071 --> 01:06:40,333
Our first grade, because some kids don't come to school until first grade.

844
01:06:41,162 --> 01:06:46,203
And then would they be screened by their actual teacher, or does it have to be somebody with a certification?

845
01:06:46,643 --> 01:06:47,943
It's really up to the district.

846
01:06:48,123 --> 01:06:52,944
They found in the studies that you could train paraprofessionals, you could train the teachers.

847
01:06:53,345 --> 01:07:02,806
It's not a very long or intense training, and most teachers, actually, once they were told this is what you are going to do, would be like, oh, OK, we could do that.

848
01:07:03,907 --> 01:07:05,107
It's not that difficult.

849
01:07:05,127 --> 01:07:06,047
Thank you.

850
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:07,587
No, I appreciate all your hard work on it.

851
01:07:07,667 --> 01:07:10,168
And me, as a parent, I think it's

852
01:07:10,654 --> 01:07:17,198
It's great to get the children tested in kindergarten before it's, you know, they're later in life, second, third, fourth grade and struggling.

853
01:07:17,258 --> 01:07:18,799
So, um, thank you.

854
01:07:18,859 --> 01:07:23,842
Counselor Carvio for bringing this forward and I second the approval on the motion for approved by council.

855
01:07:23,862 --> 01:07:25,343
Can't be all seconded by council night.

856
01:07:25,383 --> 01:07:27,584
All those in favor as amended.

857
01:07:27,764 --> 01:07:39,611
All those posts 16 dash three 27 off by council scout Pelly be resolved that the mayor's office and the health department report back to the city council outlining the guidelines

858
01:07:40,293 --> 01:07:45,356
on the free structure for portal parties for the city of Medford youth organizations.

859
01:07:45,977 --> 01:07:47,098
Uh, council Scott Pelley.

860
01:07:47,998 --> 01:07:49,419
Thank you, Mr. President.

861
01:07:49,539 --> 01:08:08,612
Uh, I received numerous phone calls and emails and, uh, um, stopped the, uh, last Tuesday evening after the park board meeting and, uh, our youth organizations, I believe we're just informed that not only are they to rent quarter parties at our public parks, but now have to pay a,

862
01:08:09,642 --> 01:08:16,528
fee of $25 per port-a-potty per month, which is unheard of.

863
01:08:16,589 --> 01:08:34,485
So I've done some research in neighboring communities, and we're pretty fortunate in Medford that our youth organizations pick up the tap on the port-a-potties that are used, not just through the days and times of use through the organizations, but also throughout the whole summer and spring.

864
01:08:36,342 --> 01:08:41,244
My question, my concerns that were brought forward were why are we paying?

865
01:08:42,645 --> 01:08:53,370
Why do they need to have to pay the fee if it's looked at as a private organization and that's under the rules and regulations of the health department?

866
01:08:53,990 --> 01:09:04,355
And if not, then maybe we should meet with the powers to be above the park board in trying to figure out a way of

867
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:08,565
aiding our youth organizations.

868
01:09:09,586 --> 01:09:21,255
One of the biggest issues that we're hearing is the lack of numbers in some of our youth sports, and maybe because of crude costs.

869
01:09:21,435 --> 01:09:28,201
And with this, it might sound like piddles, but if you keep adding on to it, we're going to,

870
01:09:30,221 --> 01:09:35,763
We're going to have to raise fees in which raising fees is going to now take our kids off the fields.

871
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:48,448
So I find it really bothersome and I'd like to know how this falls into the structure of rules and regulations in the health department.

872
01:09:48,928 --> 01:09:51,529
And then if there are issues moving forward.

873
01:09:52,027 --> 01:10:04,811
We need to sit with the park board and try to figure out something that will assist our youth organizations, whether it's waivers or assisting in fees with the porter parties.

874
01:10:05,491 --> 01:10:11,433
And I've had one call said that, well, if it's going to be ours, we're going to put a chain around it.

875
01:10:11,553 --> 01:10:20,436
And that brings another issue, because when people try to lock up porter parties, that just invites destruction.

876
01:10:21,555 --> 01:10:22,755
And that's not a pretty sight.

877
01:10:23,375 --> 01:10:36,719
I know that in my profession, we oversee all of our parks and all of the porta-potties are paid through through the DPW and it's open to the community.

878
01:10:36,779 --> 01:10:40,420
So that's if we can.

879
01:10:41,561 --> 01:10:47,783
ask for that report and get some answers back because, uh, as a season comes upon us with a lot of questions.

880
01:10:47,843 --> 01:10:49,703
So thank you.

881
01:10:49,743 --> 01:10:56,045
Counselor on the motion for approval by counselor, uh, Scott Pelly, counselor Falco.

882
01:10:56,585 --> 01:10:57,805
I'll I'll wait.

883
01:10:57,825 --> 01:11:02,407
Hi, please state your name and address for the record, man.

884
01:11:02,507 --> 01:11:04,807
Katie Martin, 20 Sagamore Avenue, Medford mess.

885
01:11:05,548 --> 01:11:07,748
Um, I am the president of Medford youth soccer.

886
01:11:07,928 --> 01:11:10,589
We're the largest youth sports organization in the city.

887
01:11:10,629 --> 01:11:10,929
We have,

888
01:11:11,363 --> 01:11:15,546
approximately 700 children participating in our soccer program this upcoming season.

889
01:11:16,446 --> 01:11:22,650
And I just would like to address the overall issue of the burden of having to provide sanitation facilities in our public parks.

890
01:11:23,111 --> 01:11:32,657
We budget about $4,000 a year, so that's money that is taken away from the children's program and is directed into providing what probably is a basic

891
01:11:33,573 --> 01:11:35,214
service that should be provided by the city.

892
01:11:35,334 --> 01:11:46,798
The additional burden of the permits being put upon us is also substantial as we provide, you know, four months of pot, four months worth of the season with potties in five different parks.

893
01:11:46,938 --> 01:11:55,721
So, um, I'd like to just bring this up as a point of consideration as to why the youth sports organizations in the city are fielding the tab for potties.

894
01:11:56,042 --> 01:11:59,903
In addition to the unsanitary situations that it creates and the potential for

895
01:12:00,533 --> 01:12:04,195
fines for those that are older than six that are using the trees for facilities.

896
01:12:04,635 --> 01:12:04,956
Thank you.

897
01:12:05,336 --> 01:12:05,996
Thank you, ma'am.

898
01:12:06,116 --> 01:12:07,577
Chair recognizes Councillor Knight.

899
01:12:08,298 --> 01:12:12,020
Yes, Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper to request what the permitting process is as well.

900
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:17,623
Especially since last week, a pot of potty popped up in front of my house on High Street on the sidewalk.

901
01:12:19,224 --> 01:12:26,288
And also, Mr. President, I'd like to see what the fee structure is, not only for youth organizations, but for anybody that would like to

902
01:12:28,556 --> 01:12:32,198
receive a permit to put a protoparty on a parcel.

903
01:12:33,099 --> 01:12:33,539
Very good.

904
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:44,385
The motion for approval and amended by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Knight, and as amended by Councilor Knight, Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

905
01:12:44,645 --> 01:12:45,546
Thank you, Mr. President.

906
01:12:45,946 --> 01:12:48,127
I too have received phone calls about this.

907
01:12:48,167 --> 01:12:53,030
He was asked questions on Saturday when he took my son to Little League tryouts.

908
01:12:53,370 --> 01:12:57,253
And I got the same type of figure

909
01:12:57,935 --> 01:13:07,120
little league had told me that they basically spent $6,000 on port-a-potties, um, for the, for the various seasons that they played baseball at the parks.

910
01:13:07,480 --> 01:13:09,461
And, uh, to me it's a bit exorbitant.

911
01:13:09,801 --> 01:13:26,070
Um, and you know, the city, it'd be nice to actually see if we could do some sort of, you know, if the leaks can't do cost sharing or something like that, it'd be nice to maybe see if we can do, the city should, in my opinion, the city should be providing the port-a-potties and, uh, basically the city should,

912
01:13:26,596 --> 01:13:47,383
If we could actually have, and I'm not sure if it would be the parks department, if we could actually have them do a cost analysis to see how much it would cost for a year, or for the time period where the parks are in use, just do a cost analysis to see how much it's gonna cost to put a porta potty at each of the parks that are in use.

913
01:13:48,064 --> 01:13:49,804
And it's something that the city should provide.

914
01:13:51,585 --> 01:13:55,046
To me, it doesn't make sense if you're increasing the cost to play soccer in Little League,

915
01:13:56,016 --> 01:13:59,578
because, you know, you have thousands of dollars of port-a-potty costs.

916
01:14:00,158 --> 01:14:03,160
So, I definitely think this is something that should be looked at.

917
01:14:03,220 --> 01:14:10,485
If we could actually have the city do a cost analysis to see how much it would cost to have a port-a-potty at each of the parks, that would be great.

918
01:14:10,745 --> 01:14:11,505
So, thank you.

919
01:14:11,985 --> 01:14:12,946
Thank you, Councilor.

920
01:14:13,306 --> 01:14:22,792
So on the motion of approval by Councilor Scott Kelly, as seconded by Councilor Knight, and as amended by both Councilors, the Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

921
01:14:23,552 --> 01:14:24,513
Thank you, Mr. President.

922
01:14:25,432 --> 01:14:30,177
I'm wondering who pays for the portal party up at the high school.

923
01:14:30,538 --> 01:14:33,561
Does anyone know who pays for the one in the field of dreams?

924
01:14:36,223 --> 01:14:44,052
So the school pays for that one up there.

925
01:14:45,393 --> 01:14:46,955
No, but it's right.

926
01:14:49,513 --> 01:14:57,116
I agree with the comments that were made, Mr. President, that with the user fees going up in this community, that's just a basic amenity.

927
01:14:58,137 --> 01:15:02,238
If they're not provided, then you're going to have the option of what else do you do?

928
01:15:02,979 --> 01:15:05,980
And the alternative isn't a great alternative.

929
01:15:06,440 --> 01:15:09,781
So I think it's worthy of the city looking into it.

930
01:15:10,462 --> 01:15:16,264
And possibly, I'm not sure how they do it in other communities, if it is so expensive, and that seems very expensive,

931
01:15:16,992 --> 01:15:18,953
That may be a service we can provide in-house.

932
01:15:19,713 --> 01:15:31,538
You know, I'm not sure in a city this size with the number of parks we have, it may be worthwhile to check into that and see if that's a service DPW can do on behalf of the community, Mr. President.

933
01:15:32,158 --> 01:15:35,180
And, you know, it's definitely worth looking into.

934
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:39,541
And I thank Councilor Scott Pelley for bringing this up.

935
01:15:40,502 --> 01:15:42,342
On the motion for approval, all those in favor?

936
01:15:42,543 --> 01:15:43,203
All those opposed?

937
01:15:43,243 --> 01:15:43,603
Motion carries.

938
01:15:45,055 --> 01:15:47,957
16-322, offered by Councilor Falco.

939
01:15:51,680 --> 01:15:58,625
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its sincere condolences to the family of Stacey K. Kirkpatrick on her recent passing.

940
01:15:59,286 --> 01:16:02,929
Stacey was born and raised in Dallas, Texas and lived in Medford for over 20 years.

941
01:16:03,829 --> 01:16:09,694
She was a nurse practitioner at the Boston Healthcare for the Homeless Program and raised over $60,000

942
01:16:11,616 --> 01:16:15,399
as an eight time rider in the pan mass challenge.

943
01:16:16,340 --> 01:16:19,562
Uh, if there's no objections, we have another condolence here too.

944
01:16:21,984 --> 01:16:32,372
Offered by counselors, Caviello and Della Russo be resolved at the Medford city council office and say condolences to the family of Brendan Daddario on the occasion of his recent passing.

945
01:16:33,613 --> 01:16:38,836
Uh, so the chair recognizes council Falco speak on Mrs Kirkpatrick.

946
01:16:39,297 --> 01:16:40,438
Thank you, Mr. President.

947
01:16:40,758 --> 01:16:40,798
Um,

948
01:16:41,272 --> 01:16:45,653
Stacey and her wife Karen were neighbors of mine.

949
01:16:46,073 --> 01:16:48,314
And Stacey was an inspiration to all of us.

950
01:16:49,114 --> 01:16:53,216
She didn't only beat cancer once, she beat cancer twice.

951
01:16:53,916 --> 01:16:57,397
And she became a nurse practitioner.

952
01:16:58,477 --> 01:17:06,479
Like you said earlier, she rode in the PMC Challenge, I believe, eight times, which is a remarkable accomplishment.

953
01:17:08,856 --> 01:17:11,958
She went to Haiti to help out after the earthquake.

954
01:17:12,959 --> 01:17:14,480
She was just a remarkable woman.

955
01:17:15,121 --> 01:17:19,224
And I was talking to her friend, Joan Sear, earlier tonight.

956
01:17:19,864 --> 01:17:27,049
And she basically hit it on the head that Medford has lost a shining light of hope and resilience.

957
01:17:27,550 --> 01:17:30,932
And my thoughts and prayers go out to the family.

958
01:17:31,032 --> 01:17:32,233
So thank you.

959
01:17:32,954 --> 01:17:33,814
Thank you, Counselor.

960
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:37,297
And if you would all join us for a moment of silence.

961
01:17:38,948 --> 01:17:39,348
Thank you.

962
01:17:39,648 --> 01:17:49,652
If I may, on this not good day, Osher, we should take a moment to say a prayer, if you'd like, for what happened in Brussels, Belgium.

963
01:17:50,432 --> 01:18:06,478
Thank you.

964
01:18:06,498 --> 01:18:08,519
Petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

965
01:18:10,829 --> 01:18:26,701
16-323, petition for common official's license by Jeffrey B. Chen, president for Two Chins Restaurant, Incorporated, doing business as Maylings, 434A, Salem Street, Medford, Mass.

966
01:18:27,281 --> 01:18:36,668
On file business certificate number 60, building department, fire department, police, traffic, impact, health department, treasurer, letter of compliance, tax identification, workman's comp,

967
01:18:37,328 --> 01:18:40,510
Certificate of organization and petition all approved.

968
01:18:40,690 --> 01:18:43,152
Chair recognizes Councilor Caviello.

969
01:18:43,232 --> 01:18:45,493
Chairman of the Licensing Committee, full recommendation.

970
01:18:46,814 --> 01:18:47,635
Thank you, Mr. President.

971
01:18:48,375 --> 01:18:52,078
Mr. President, I have reviewed the papers and they appear to be in order.

972
01:18:53,019 --> 01:18:57,101
And they are, are you just changing ownership from your old mailings to?

973
01:18:57,722 --> 01:18:59,463
Hi, please state your name and address for the record.

974
01:18:59,723 --> 01:19:01,084
Yes, Councilors.

975
01:19:01,104 --> 01:19:01,784
Good evening.

976
01:19:02,245 --> 01:19:04,967
Margaret Sue, attorney for Two Shins Restaurant, Inc.

977
01:19:05,667 --> 01:19:06,588
I have here today

978
01:19:07,837 --> 01:19:09,498
the owner, Jeffrey B. Chen.

979
01:19:10,239 --> 01:19:16,343
And he is going to be mainly changing ownership of the business.

980
01:19:18,665 --> 01:19:20,106
Very good.

981
01:19:20,126 --> 01:19:25,610
Mr. President, my only question is, this is a new business.

982
01:19:26,671 --> 01:19:30,854
The hours of operation are 7 a.m.

983
01:19:30,894 --> 01:19:31,634
to 12 a.m.

984
01:19:31,654 --> 01:19:35,337
on Friday and Saturday and Sunday, 7 a.m.

985
01:19:35,417 --> 01:19:35,657
to 1 a.m.

986
01:19:37,681 --> 01:19:39,302
Do these carry over from the old business?

987
01:19:39,862 --> 01:19:40,362
Mr. Clark?

988
01:19:41,422 --> 01:19:51,905
Everything appears to be in order, and I hope you do the same good job that Mayling's has done for many years in this community.

989
01:19:52,385 --> 01:20:02,448
As a matter of fact, actually, Mr. Chen is actually a family friend of the previous owner, Michelle, and that's, it's going to be

990
01:20:02,929 --> 01:20:10,454
basically keeping it kind of in the family because she's, you know, has it been a staple in that area and it is, and I hope they continue the good work.

991
01:20:11,014 --> 01:20:13,476
Yes, that's, that's exactly the intent.

992
01:20:13,576 --> 01:20:13,836
Very good.

993
01:20:13,856 --> 01:20:16,518
So on the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello, Councilor Knight.

994
01:20:17,242 --> 01:20:20,124
Yes, Mr. President, Councilor Caviello took the words right out of my mouth.

995
01:20:20,164 --> 01:20:31,733
I know that Mei-Ling's has been open late night for a very long time and I wanted to be sure that they were allowed to continue to do so because I may, once in a while, pop in there after 11 o'clock at night to get a little bite to eat.

996
01:20:31,793 --> 01:20:33,434
So I wish you all the best of luck.

997
01:20:33,454 --> 01:20:36,536
So you have my support on this matter and thank you very much for appearing this evening.

998
01:20:36,896 --> 01:20:37,236
Thank you.

999
01:20:37,457 --> 01:20:37,817
Very good.

1000
01:20:37,837 --> 01:20:39,738
On the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello.

1001
01:20:39,798 --> 01:20:40,679
All those in favor?

1002
01:20:40,699 --> 01:20:41,319
Aye.

1003
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:42,560
All those opposed?

1004
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:43,241
Motion carries.

1005
01:20:43,361 --> 01:20:44,882
Good luck.

1006
01:20:50,168 --> 01:20:57,411
16-324, petition by Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street, Metro Massachusetts, to address the council about police and fire departments.

1007
01:20:57,911 --> 01:20:58,091
Ms.

1008
01:20:58,131 --> 01:20:59,952
Martin, please state your name and address for the record.

1009
01:20:59,992 --> 01:21:00,352
Welcome.

1010
01:21:00,932 --> 01:21:01,292
Thank you.

1011
01:21:01,352 --> 01:21:02,613
Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

1012
01:21:05,514 --> 01:21:11,797
I was wrong a couple of weeks ago when I backslid on mandating a new public safety building for this city.

1013
01:21:12,637 --> 01:21:17,159
I remember saying to myself and saying to you, there's not an appetite in this for this city.

1014
01:21:18,060 --> 01:21:18,480
You know what?

1015
01:21:19,342 --> 01:21:24,003
Doesn't matter whether there's an appetite in this city, it has to happen.

1016
01:21:24,503 --> 01:21:30,265
The reason is because Mayor Burke has made a few small gestures in the right direction toward open government.

1017
01:21:30,685 --> 01:21:38,307
And so in response to this good faith effort on her part, I essentially gave her a pass on building out the public safety building.

1018
01:21:39,428 --> 01:21:41,568
I was wrong and felt guilty later that night.

1019
01:21:42,568 --> 01:21:48,510
She needs to be able to do both simultaneously, open up government and make it transparent

1020
01:21:48,867 --> 01:21:51,189
but she also needs to address the new police building.

1021
01:21:53,250 --> 01:22:00,455
She cannot claim ignorance to both matters as essential to the running of this city, but she is not the only one.

1022
01:22:00,975 --> 01:22:04,517
This city is also willfully ignoring the needs of our police department.

1023
01:22:06,559 --> 01:22:12,803
And if the people are in a state of collective denial, then it is my job to hold the citizenry accountable as well.

1024
01:22:14,744 --> 01:22:16,085
Not only do the local police

1025
01:22:16,650 --> 01:22:30,236
have to save people from themselves and others in its traditional role, they are being asked to become the front line for domestic terrorism, and we need to adjust and prepare our men and women in public safety to be ready for this new demand on them.

1026
01:22:31,356 --> 01:22:38,079
Today, in Brussels, terrorists once again sent fear throughout Europe, killing 34 and wounding 28 others.

1027
01:22:38,599 --> 01:22:39,880
And that was an early estimate.

1028
01:22:40,744 --> 01:22:43,306
The target was near the headquarters of the European Union.

1029
01:22:44,226 --> 01:22:48,329
Boston is also a symbolic city, in case you were wondering.

1030
01:22:50,450 --> 01:22:53,712
They bombed an airport and a subway.

1031
01:22:54,412 --> 01:22:55,213
What does Boston have?

1032
01:22:55,593 --> 01:22:56,774
An airport and a subway.

1033
01:22:58,035 --> 01:23:10,042
Less than one year ago, on July 17, 2015, the local police, the local police, took down the domestic terrorist who shot up a recruiting station at Chattanooga, Tennessee.

1034
01:23:10,650 --> 01:23:14,893
and went on to kill four Marines and wounded three others at a naval training station.

1035
01:23:15,814 --> 01:23:18,395
It was the local police who stopped the shooter.

1036
01:23:19,256 --> 01:23:21,257
We have a recruiting station in Medford Square.

1037
01:23:22,058 --> 01:23:23,259
Why do we think we're immune?

1038
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:35,147
Also on November 13, 2015, terrorists attacked several sites simultaneously in Paris, killing 128 and wounding countless others.

1039
01:23:35,967 --> 01:23:38,109
It was, again, the local police

1040
01:23:39,371 --> 01:23:41,873
the local police who killed the attackers.

1041
01:23:43,614 --> 01:23:54,723
And on December 2, 2015, domestic terrorists opened fire on innocent people in their workplace, killing 14 and injuring 22 others in San Bernardino, California.

1042
01:23:59,286 --> 01:24:01,788
If that's not enough, I will hit you where you live.

1043
01:24:02,869 --> 01:24:08,974
While the following statistic includes school buses, college campuses, and suicides on school property,

1044
01:24:09,567 --> 01:24:17,349
In 2015 alone, there were 52 school shootings resulting in 30 deaths and 53 others injured.

1045
01:24:18,089 --> 01:24:19,229
Why do we think we're immune?

1046
01:24:21,330 --> 01:24:23,910
They're getting so commonplace, they don't even report them anymore.

1047
01:24:25,310 --> 01:24:28,691
The problem isn't the public safety professionals, it's the public, period.

1048
01:24:29,411 --> 01:24:37,573
With absolute clarity, I can tell you that sooner rather than later, there will be a group of well-intentioned, genuine people who will want to spend money

1049
01:24:38,139 --> 01:24:43,341
on renovating the library or building a new high school or, no offense, an art center.

1050
01:24:44,741 --> 01:24:54,144
And the sad part is that they have a better chance at seeing their want list checked off before a new public safety station is built.

1051
01:24:55,305 --> 01:25:02,327
Most people's experience with the police is either watching them on a detail, standing in the street, or getting pulled over for a traffic stop.

1052
01:25:03,187 --> 01:25:05,928
But I assure you that they do a lot more than that today.

1053
01:25:06,915 --> 01:25:09,797
And you better start appreciating them, or chaos will ensue.

1054
01:25:11,958 --> 01:25:19,442
I am for police reform, and I believe it is in the best interest of both the police and us.

1055
01:25:20,322 --> 01:25:34,070
The public included, including but not limited to, details, crowd control, toxic spills, fires, sensitivity training, overtime limits, relaxation techniques, school shootings, terrorist bomber threats, you name it.

1056
01:25:34,830 --> 01:25:35,831
All of these come under the

1057
01:25:36,382 --> 01:25:38,263
purview of the police department training.

1058
01:25:40,843 --> 01:25:41,804
That's just a short list.

1059
01:25:43,224 --> 01:25:56,488
But it all starts with the solid base of operations, which our police and fire do not have at this time in order to face the issues of 2016, when the building they are working out of was built in 1962.

1060
01:25:56,588 --> 01:26:02,270
Mayor Burke, you no longer have a choice to look the other way on this.

1061
01:26:02,850 --> 01:26:03,830
It is not a maybe.

1062
01:26:04,373 --> 01:26:06,494
or a in seven years decision.

1063
01:26:07,215 --> 01:26:08,255
It has to be made today.

1064
01:26:08,876 --> 01:26:12,518
The plan has to be started today in order for it to be up and running in three years.

1065
01:26:14,539 --> 01:26:19,522
To the people of Medford, the mayor takes her cue from you, and you stand silent to this.

1066
01:26:21,043 --> 01:26:22,304
You are just as much to blame.

1067
01:26:23,404 --> 01:26:25,485
These men and women aren't there for the fun of it.

1068
01:26:26,006 --> 01:26:29,648
They are there in that building to carry out your protection.

1069
01:26:30,784 --> 01:26:35,148
While it is an ugly topic, it is not one that can be avoided anymore.

1070
01:26:35,789 --> 01:26:39,933
We need to send everyone in this city to police empathy school.

1071
01:26:44,237 --> 01:26:52,405
And yes, I do agree with our police and fire from time to time, and I disagree with our police and fire from time to time, and will continue to do so.

1072
01:26:53,426 --> 01:26:54,607
They're not always right either.

1073
01:26:55,337 --> 01:26:59,338
The two values can and do sit side by side for me.

1074
01:27:00,318 --> 01:27:06,519
We need to give them all the right tools for the job and teach them better skill sets to manage today's problems.

1075
01:27:06,979 --> 01:27:09,219
They are not exclusive of one another.

1076
01:27:10,460 --> 01:27:18,361
I can assure you today, this city has let me down and let the police down horribly, and it continues to do so.

1077
01:27:19,541 --> 01:27:24,442
Ask yourselves, why don't I care about the people who swear to run into danger

1078
01:27:25,007 --> 01:27:27,969
when I am too chicken and run out.

1079
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:29,650
Why?

1080
01:27:29,751 --> 01:27:35,955
Because it impacts your desires to build a park, school, recreation building, or renovate some other interest you have.

1081
01:27:36,816 --> 01:27:38,557
You don't see it as selfishness.

1082
01:27:38,597 --> 01:27:46,263
You couch it in some good-for-all construct that helps you rationalize your goals over that of the entire city.

1083
01:27:48,324 --> 01:27:50,706
And make no mistake, I don't do this for the police department.

1084
01:27:51,247 --> 01:27:53,048
I do this for the betterment of the entire city.

1085
01:27:54,622 --> 01:28:02,704
While I am calling out the mayor for negligence in making this a priority, I am also calling out my fellow citizens for selfishness above and beyond recklessness.

1086
01:28:04,324 --> 01:28:11,085
The police are there for you, and they don't ask you for your insurance card before administering Narcan to your kid.

1087
01:28:12,066 --> 01:28:18,007
They don't ask you while they are standing between you and your crazy ex, what is it you do for a living?

1088
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:23,868
The fire department is there for you when you are having a heart attack, and they don't say, wait,

1089
01:28:24,733 --> 01:28:25,773
My kid's in Little League.

1090
01:28:26,034 --> 01:28:27,134
I'll have to get to you later.

1091
01:28:27,854 --> 01:28:28,535
They say now.

1092
01:28:29,695 --> 01:28:30,896
I will be there right now.

1093
01:28:31,656 --> 01:28:33,257
I will be there right now for you.

1094
01:28:34,037 --> 01:28:36,598
It is our job to be there for them right now.

1095
01:28:40,680 --> 01:28:41,980
Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

1096
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:43,561
Motion received and placed on file, Mr. President.

1097
01:28:43,581 --> 01:28:46,682
On the motion for Councilor Knight to receive the paper and place it on file.

1098
01:28:47,023 --> 01:28:47,723
All those in favor?

1099
01:28:47,763 --> 01:28:48,783
Motion to suspend, Mr. President.

1100
01:28:49,163 --> 01:28:51,324
On the motion for suspension of the rules by Councilor Knight.

1101
01:28:51,404 --> 01:28:52,065
All those in favor?

1102
01:28:52,085 --> 01:28:52,765
All those opposed?

1103
01:28:54,330 --> 01:29:04,534
Earlier this evening the Subcommittee on Zoning and Ordinances met to discuss paper number 16309 at the request of Councilor Marks and the concurrence of this Council.

1104
01:29:05,134 --> 01:29:09,416
This paper was before us last week and it was an amendment to the outdoor dining license.

1105
01:29:10,296 --> 01:29:15,198
This amendment to the outdoor dining license clarified the improper interpretation of the legislative intent.

1106
01:29:15,831 --> 01:29:16,652
It takes nothing out.

1107
01:29:17,112 --> 01:29:22,656
Presently, this is a $25 fee, Mr. President, for an individual to apply for an outdoor dining license.

1108
01:29:22,836 --> 01:29:33,043
The new language added to the ordinance would read, the provisions of this article shall be applicable and specifically limited to sidewalks and other property which is under the jurisdiction of the city.

1109
01:29:33,935 --> 01:29:45,518
or any of its departments, notwithstanding the provisions of this article, all other laws, regulations, ordinances, and codes that pertain or relate to outdoor dining shall continue to be applicable and in full force in effect."

1110
01:29:46,018 --> 01:29:58,622
So this change, Mr. President, based on the determination of the subcommittee with the advice and consent of the city solicitor, reported it out, indicating that all it did was clarify the legislative intent of the passage of the previous ordinance back in 2014.

1111
01:29:58,962 --> 01:30:02,323
And the subcommittee reported it out favorably, Mr. President.

1112
01:30:02,851 --> 01:30:05,031
As such, I would move for approval on the paper.

1113
01:30:05,992 --> 01:30:16,054
On the motion for approval on paper number 16-309, Amendment to the Outdoor Dining Ordinance.

1114
01:30:17,074 --> 01:30:18,734
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1115
01:30:20,855 --> 01:30:21,555
First reading.

1116
01:30:21,575 --> 01:30:23,055
Councilor?

1117
01:30:26,136 --> 01:30:28,956
On the motion for Councilor Caviello to waive the three readings.

1118
01:30:29,537 --> 01:30:30,457
All those in favor?

1119
01:30:30,477 --> 01:30:31,377
Aye.

1120
01:30:33,541 --> 01:30:34,622
Councilor Marks?

1121
01:30:37,403 --> 01:30:52,428
Mr. President, I would ask that my colleague withdraw the motion based on the fact that the three readings are in place to, first of all, require public notification, which the second reading is the printing of it in the local newspaper.

1122
01:30:53,169 --> 01:31:00,271
And the third reading allows residents of this community to come up and speak on it and give input if necessary.

1123
01:31:00,691 --> 01:31:02,132
So I would ask with all due respect

1124
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:08,052
That my council colleague remove that in the interest of transparency, Mr. President.

1125
01:31:09,532 --> 01:31:11,392
The chair recognizes Council Member Kern.

1126
01:31:13,093 --> 01:31:15,414
I'm sorry, Madam Vice President.

1127
01:31:15,434 --> 01:31:16,534
Thank you, President De La Russo.

1128
01:31:16,754 --> 01:31:19,375
Councilman Lacks said it perfectly.

1129
01:31:19,715 --> 01:31:22,776
I just believe that the three readings are necessary.

1130
01:31:22,836 --> 01:31:30,958
It's something that a few of us councilors believe should be taking place, especially after what we've heard during election time and the need for transparency.

1131
01:31:32,529 --> 01:31:36,150
Councilor Caraviello has a motion on the floor to waive the three readings.

1132
01:31:36,290 --> 01:31:37,590
I'll rescind my motion, Mr. President.

1133
01:31:37,770 --> 01:31:38,130
I'm sorry?

1134
01:31:38,450 --> 01:31:40,190
I will rescind my motion for Councilor Nights.

1135
01:31:40,751 --> 01:31:42,451
I will rescind my motion for Councilor Nights.

1136
01:31:42,471 --> 01:31:49,132
The motion of Councilor Caraviello for the suspension of the three readings is rescinded.

1137
01:31:49,532 --> 01:31:49,952
Mr. President.

1138
01:31:49,972 --> 01:31:51,352
Mr. Clerk, call the roll, please.

1139
01:31:51,372 --> 01:31:52,273
Mr. President, if I could get a clarification.

1140
01:31:52,293 --> 01:31:53,273
Councilor Night, if you would.

1141
01:31:53,793 --> 01:31:59,694
Can the clerk explain after the three readings I waived what the process is in terms of notification, so on and so forth?

1142
01:32:00,646 --> 01:32:09,490
If the three readings are waived, it would then go to the, it would be an advertisement to the public.

1143
01:32:11,771 --> 01:32:15,553
So the advertisement requirement still remains in place.

1144
01:32:15,853 --> 01:32:19,494
However, the final reading at the meeting would be waived.

1145
01:32:20,135 --> 01:32:20,595
Thank you very much.

1146
01:32:22,902 --> 01:32:27,165
On the motion for approval of the first reading by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1147
01:32:27,765 --> 01:32:28,686
The roll is called.

1148
01:32:29,306 --> 01:32:33,910
Mr. President, I just want to thank my council colleague, Councilor Caviello, for his understanding on that.

1149
01:32:34,570 --> 01:32:35,891
Thank you, Councilor.

1150
01:32:35,911 --> 01:32:41,154
The records show that Councilor Marks expressed his gratitude to Councilor Caviello.

1151
01:32:41,415 --> 01:32:42,595
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1152
01:32:43,116 --> 01:32:43,996
Commit to the part of the paper.

1153
01:32:44,036 --> 01:32:44,357
Yes.

1154
01:32:45,838 --> 01:32:46,578
Councilor Calderon.

1155
01:32:46,758 --> 01:32:46,978
Yes.

1156
01:32:47,759 --> 01:32:48,259
Councilor Knight.

1157
01:32:48,399 --> 01:32:48,740
Yes.

1158
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:50,241
Vice President O'Connor.

1159
01:32:50,281 --> 01:32:50,521
Yes.

1160
01:32:51,021 --> 01:32:51,622
Councilor Marks.

1161
01:32:51,862 --> 01:32:51,942
Yes.

1162
01:32:52,783 --> 01:32:53,524
Councilor Scarpelli?

1163
01:32:53,604 --> 01:32:53,844
Yes.

1164
01:32:54,625 --> 01:32:55,445
President DelaRusso?

1165
01:32:55,606 --> 01:32:56,106
Yes.

1166
01:32:56,206 --> 01:32:58,248
With a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

1167
01:32:58,748 --> 01:32:59,649
First reading passes.

1168
01:32:59,709 --> 01:33:13,502
While we're under suspension, offered in council March 22nd, 2016 by Councilor Scarpelli, number 16-328, be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Jay Campbell,

1169
01:33:18,055 --> 01:33:24,923
for organizing a very successful Medford night at the Boston Celtics game last evening, March 21st.

1170
01:33:25,483 --> 01:33:34,273
Over 900 Medford residents attended the game and raised over $11,000 for various Medford programs.

1171
01:33:34,734 --> 01:33:35,735
Councilor Scott Kelly.

1172
01:33:36,065 --> 01:33:37,166
Well, thank you, Mr. President.

1173
01:33:37,186 --> 01:33:43,069
This is a gentleman that everybody knows but nobody knows in Medford, Jay Campbell.

1174
01:33:43,369 --> 01:33:47,331
I've known Jay for a few years, being a parent of the McGlynn School.

1175
01:33:48,932 --> 01:33:56,616
Jay helped our PTG raise some money through a fundraising effort with the Boston Celtics.

1176
01:33:57,117 --> 01:34:00,458
He realized how big it was and it started to grow.

1177
01:34:01,099 --> 01:34:03,420
So he contacted the Celtics and

1178
01:34:04,302 --> 01:34:09,728
Reached out to every organization that is a fundraising organization in the city.

1179
01:34:10,389 --> 01:34:22,363
And everybody from, I know the Joey Lopez Foundation, all the PTGs, a few of the basketball programs in the city.

1180
01:34:22,968 --> 01:34:24,249
And everybody jumped right in.

1181
01:34:24,509 --> 01:34:26,831
And last night was an amazing evening.

1182
01:34:27,892 --> 01:34:31,815
Jay's intent isn't just to raise money, but getting the whole community involved.

1183
01:34:31,855 --> 01:34:42,664
I believe Dean Bruno was named the citizen of the game for the Celtics for all of his efforts and what he's doing with his endeavors.

1184
01:34:42,704 --> 01:34:50,170
And I believe almost every kid that was involved, every child that was involved, was part of the game, whether they played on the court,

1185
01:34:50,773 --> 01:34:53,074
I know the Mephiti boys played the Mephiti girls team.

1186
01:34:53,434 --> 01:34:55,616
I believe the girls won by 66 points, John.

1187
01:34:57,797 --> 01:35:01,519
And high fives to the kids and the players.

1188
01:35:01,559 --> 01:35:07,082
But it was something that, I forget about the money that was raised, but what a community event.

1189
01:35:07,442 --> 01:35:16,207
It was nice to see when you're walking through the venue like the Boston Garden and seeing everybody so happy and involved.

1190
01:35:16,267 --> 01:35:17,888
So I just want to thank Jay publicly.

1191
01:35:18,361 --> 01:35:19,201
for everything he did.

1192
01:35:19,261 --> 01:35:23,483
I know that's thankless, and it's, you know, he does it out of the goodness of his own heart.

1193
01:35:23,503 --> 01:35:24,203
So, thank you, Jay.

1194
01:35:24,683 --> 01:35:25,363
Thank you, Jay.

1195
01:35:25,583 --> 01:35:26,324
Councilor Falco.

1196
01:35:26,424 --> 01:35:27,404
Thank you, Mr. President.

1197
01:35:27,484 --> 01:35:29,945
I just want to echo the sentiments of a colleague.

1198
01:35:30,425 --> 01:35:32,926
Jay did a fabulous job organizing the event.

1199
01:35:33,806 --> 01:35:38,448
All the kids were involved in something, and, you know, Jay doesn't get to watch any of the game.

1200
01:35:38,508 --> 01:35:47,731
He literally runs around the garden the whole night trying to get the kids into position as to where they need to go, if they're playing or if they're giving players high fives and whatnot.

1201
01:35:48,590 --> 01:35:51,211
Congratulations to Jay on a job well done.

1202
01:35:51,751 --> 01:35:53,672
On the motion approved by Councilor Scott Pelley.

1203
01:35:53,712 --> 01:35:54,653
All those in favor?

1204
01:35:54,973 --> 01:35:55,073
Aye.

1205
01:35:55,353 --> 01:35:56,194
All those opposed?

1206
01:35:56,334 --> 01:35:57,114
Motion carries.

1207
01:35:57,214 --> 01:36:00,456
While we're on to suspension, meeting notice.

1208
01:36:01,356 --> 01:36:15,402
Tomorrow night is the last meeting of the Mayor Burke Economic and Business Development Committee, subcommittee for the transition meeting in South Medford at the Arthur W. So,

1209
01:36:17,693 --> 01:36:26,098
the Arthur W. Russell Community Center at Engine 5, 6 to 8 p.m., Economic and Business Subcommittee on South Metro.

1210
01:36:26,799 --> 01:36:29,521
While we're under suspension, Councilor Marks has this to offer.

1211
01:36:29,941 --> 01:36:36,505
Be it resolved that the city report back on the number of outstanding common vitual licenses citywide.

1212
01:36:36,585 --> 01:36:37,326
Councilor Marks.

1213
01:36:38,206 --> 01:36:39,247
Thank you, Mr. President.

1214
01:36:39,567 --> 01:36:44,911
It was brought to my attention that the Board of Health, prior to

1215
01:36:45,945 --> 01:37:00,793
approving the common vigilance license is requesting on-site visits to many establishments, of which many establishments are doing business without their common vigilance licenses.

1216
01:37:01,633 --> 01:37:04,875
And this seems to be a change over previous years.

1217
01:37:04,895 --> 01:37:14,020
So I would just ask that we get a report back from someone in the administration, maybe Karen Rose or someone else regarding

1218
01:37:15,376 --> 01:37:24,583
why this is a new process that's taken place and what is holding up the on-site visits for some of these business establishments.

1219
01:37:25,164 --> 01:37:25,584
Very good.

1220
01:37:25,664 --> 01:37:29,127
So we'll send that to the Mayor's office to be disseminated where it needs to go.

1221
01:37:29,468 --> 01:37:33,591
On the motion approved by Councilman Marks, Councilor Caravaglio.

1222
01:37:34,252 --> 01:37:34,572
Okay.

1223
01:37:35,673 --> 01:37:37,834
On that motion, all those in favor?

1224
01:37:38,295 --> 01:37:38,435
Aye.

1225
01:37:38,855 --> 01:37:40,036
All those against?

1226
01:37:40,056 --> 01:37:40,337
Carried.

1227
01:37:41,970 --> 01:37:43,931
Chair recognizes councilor Caviello.

1228
01:37:44,051 --> 01:38:00,916
Mr. President, while we're on the suspension, 16094 in our package this week, we got back an answer from Republic Parking on amendment B and amendment C. It says C attached.

1229
01:38:00,976 --> 01:38:02,217
I don't see anything attached there.

1230
01:38:03,357 --> 01:38:06,918
What are you referring to, councilor?

1231
01:38:06,938 --> 01:38:09,099
16094, some questions we asked of Republic Parking.

1232
01:38:10,400 --> 01:38:11,500
And they gave us an answer here.

1233
01:38:12,072 --> 01:38:17,273
But it says C attached on letter B and letter C, and I don't see any attached.

1234
01:38:17,914 --> 01:38:18,334
Oh, yes.

1235
01:38:23,195 --> 01:38:24,856
What is your motion then, Councillor?

1236
01:38:25,576 --> 01:38:26,416
I'm looking for the attachments.

1237
01:38:27,376 --> 01:38:33,778
Be it resolved by Councillor Caviello that the response from Republic Parking

1238
01:38:34,255 --> 01:38:36,857
be re-sent to us with the attachments.

1239
01:38:36,917 --> 01:38:37,757
All those in favor?

1240
01:38:38,418 --> 01:38:39,438
All those opposed?

1241
01:38:39,458 --> 01:38:40,079
Motion carries.

1242
01:38:40,499 --> 01:38:45,362
On the motion of council, Vice President Long of Kern to revert back to the regular order of business.

1243
01:38:45,402 --> 01:38:46,162
All those in favor?

1244
01:38:46,623 --> 01:38:47,383
All those opposed?

1245
01:38:47,443 --> 01:38:49,884
Motion carries.

1246
01:38:49,905 --> 01:39:01,992
16-326, petition by Robert M. Penta, Zero, Summit Road, Medford, Mass, to address the City Council regarding Republic parking issues.

1247
01:39:03,293 --> 01:39:03,893
Good evening, sir.

1248
01:39:03,974 --> 01:39:06,195
Please state your name and address for the record.

1249
01:39:06,555 --> 01:39:10,938
Robert Pentz, Zero Summit Road, Medford Mass, former colleague of this August body.

1250
01:39:12,079 --> 01:39:18,963
On January 29th of this past year, Republic met with the mayor of this community as it relates to certain parking issues that have been going on.

1251
01:39:19,003 --> 01:39:31,392
But I would just like to revert back to July 23rd of 2015, when the local press, the mayor at that time who was running, had sent in a press release indicating that there were 12 things

1252
01:39:32,347 --> 01:39:36,429
that she would like to see take place as it relates to Republic.

1253
01:39:36,770 --> 01:39:41,092
And the request at that time was to have it done immediately, not in January.

1254
01:39:41,853 --> 01:39:42,753
And we're still waiting.

1255
01:39:43,594 --> 01:39:48,657
But she updated that on August 23rd of this past year.

1256
01:39:49,217 --> 01:39:52,519
And what she updated, strike that, on August 30th of this past year.

1257
01:39:52,659 --> 01:39:55,121
And what she updated was another press release.

1258
01:39:55,161 --> 01:39:59,083
And she also sent out a survey to the peoples of this community.

1259
01:39:59,604 --> 01:40:01,885
And the survey was particular, in one particular area.

1260
01:40:02,182 --> 01:40:08,686
Question number one, would you be supportive of exempting senior citizens from having to pay to park in the city of Medford?

1261
01:40:09,166 --> 01:40:13,989
I believe our seniors should not have to encounter any frustration in their daily lives.

1262
01:40:14,349 --> 01:40:16,231
And that's part of the base commentary.

1263
01:40:17,091 --> 01:40:26,177
And on the second page of the survey, there were four questions, and the very first one was, do you think senior citizens should be exempt from paying or parking at kiosks and meters?

1264
01:40:27,177 --> 01:40:31,340
And I believe it was October 23rd, and the debate that we had

1265
01:40:31,992 --> 01:40:37,754
She publicly announced, once again, seniors should not have to pay, and she was making that a priority.

1266
01:40:38,654 --> 01:40:42,276
This is now September 20th, I mean, strike that, March 23rd.

1267
01:40:43,116 --> 01:40:54,240
This is a huge issue, because no matter where I go walking around this city, and I'm quite sure members of this council have heard the same thing, you know, the seniors of this community believe that they're going to be entitled to this discount.

1268
01:40:55,060 --> 01:40:56,100
It was a campaign issue.

1269
01:40:56,120 --> 01:40:57,421
It was a campaign promise.

1270
01:40:58,121 --> 01:40:59,821
It was a campaign press release.

1271
01:41:00,242 --> 01:41:01,282
It was a double-headed story.

1272
01:41:01,706 --> 01:41:02,887
And it was a survey they went out.

1273
01:41:03,687 --> 01:41:08,670
I believe, in all honesty, if you're going to make promises such as this, you need to honor them.

1274
01:41:08,930 --> 01:41:10,831
If not, have a discussion as to why not.

1275
01:41:11,531 --> 01:41:29,321
I don't think this council has had any discussion with the mayor and with Republic as it relates to any of the 12 issues that were reported on July 23rd in the local paper and on August 30th, as was presented by then-candidate Mayor Burke, as she is now, Mayor Burke.

1276
01:41:29,772 --> 01:41:31,872
I just think it's too important of an issue, Mr. President.

1277
01:41:31,912 --> 01:41:33,373
Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1278
01:41:34,933 --> 01:41:41,794
With all due respect to the speaker, this council hasn't had its own questions answered, never mind those that were made in campaign promises, Councilor Pinto.

1279
01:41:41,814 --> 01:41:44,295
So I can certainly appreciate where you're coming from.

1280
01:41:44,315 --> 01:41:47,635
I'm just alluding to the fact that this is what I'm hearing more and more as I'm walking the streets.

1281
01:41:48,355 --> 01:41:51,096
Give the mayor an opportunity sometime, I have no problem with that.

1282
01:41:51,516 --> 01:41:54,236
But the fact of the matter is there's nothing on the table that even talks about it.

1283
01:41:54,676 --> 01:41:56,637
That was the number one question in the survey.

1284
01:41:57,077 --> 01:41:58,597
It was the number one comment.

1285
01:41:59,044 --> 01:41:59,865
and the press release.

1286
01:42:00,425 --> 01:42:11,393
And when you lead with something like that, and you're leading people to believe that this is what it's about, and thinking there's a rainy day that's going to go away with some sunshine for seniors, we don't even know if it's going to be 55, 62, 65.

1287
01:42:12,493 --> 01:42:15,596
I don't know what the number is, but whatever it is, so be it.

1288
01:42:16,116 --> 01:42:17,957
It's for the senior citizens of this community.

1289
01:42:19,258 --> 01:42:27,544
And with that being said, I would hope one member of the council, if not the council in general, would basically make the request of the mayor, if in fact she is going to honor that pledge,

1290
01:42:28,123 --> 01:42:29,965
of granting senior citizens a discount.

1291
01:42:30,785 --> 01:42:41,254
And when you people have your meeting with her, that as well as the other 12 things that were outlined on July 23rd in the local press, which still haven't come to fruition, need to be addressed.

1292
01:42:41,634 --> 01:42:44,096
You know, we all ran for politics.

1293
01:42:44,136 --> 01:42:45,558
Some of us win, some of us lose.

1294
01:42:46,118 --> 01:42:52,103
But you have to stand by what you're running on and the principles of what you're running on and the comments that you're talking about.

1295
01:42:52,583 --> 01:42:56,547
And they just can't be there for the sake of being political and making political hay

1296
01:42:57,040 --> 01:42:58,901
It's just appeasing the people that you're talking to.

1297
01:43:01,141 --> 01:43:02,241
They've met January 29th.

1298
01:43:02,361 --> 01:43:08,063
It's obvious that you guys have no idea, and ladies, no idea what took place on January 29th.

1299
01:43:08,363 --> 01:43:09,844
You don't know what the discussions have been.

1300
01:43:10,284 --> 01:43:12,924
It's obvious that something is going on that you're not aware of.

1301
01:43:13,825 --> 01:43:20,566
Councilor Caviello, I think the conversation that we had a few weeks ago, you haven't even gotten an update to the financial question that you asked.

1302
01:43:22,587 --> 01:43:25,128
Part of the attachment that you never got, so they're just keeping you in limbo.

1303
01:43:26,291 --> 01:43:43,703
whatever it might be, I would just hope, and I would ask one of my colleagues, one of my colleagues that are presently here, if they would put that in the form of a motion for a report to get an answer back on, because I think it's in all fairness to all the seniors in this community, it was a major campaign issue, and it still hasn't been addressed.

1304
01:43:44,404 --> 01:43:45,725
Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

1305
01:43:45,905 --> 01:43:48,567
I found the request, Mr. President, to be a moot point earlier in this meeting.

1306
01:43:48,607 --> 01:43:54,111
The council has requested to sit down with the mayor and the administration and Republic Parking to speak about the program and the direction that it's going in.

1307
01:43:54,131 --> 01:43:55,692
So I think that this action has already been taken.

1308
01:43:56,058 --> 01:43:56,378
It has.

1309
01:43:56,398 --> 01:43:57,879
The chair determines that.

1310
01:43:58,359 --> 01:43:59,679
So on the motion of council on night.

1311
01:44:00,920 --> 01:44:02,360
Well, Mr. President, let me ask you a question.

1312
01:44:02,681 --> 01:44:05,722
How could that be determined when that issue has not even been brought up?

1313
01:44:06,182 --> 01:44:10,924
You've had other financial issues brought up, but you haven't had the issues of the senior citizen parking.

1314
01:44:11,184 --> 01:44:12,904
It's separate and distinct unto itself.

1315
01:44:14,685 --> 01:44:19,287
I believe that the, can the clerk please read back the amendments to the paper that were passed earlier this evening?

1316
01:44:32,522 --> 01:44:39,207
And the Senior Citizen Discount was part of a motion that was filed by this body unanimously within this term.

1317
01:44:40,267 --> 01:44:41,008
Thank you.

1318
01:44:41,308 --> 01:44:44,130
I beg to disagree with you, Council President DelaRosa.

1319
01:44:44,150 --> 01:44:45,911
There's nothing in the records that even reflect that.

1320
01:44:46,492 --> 01:44:51,855
I'm making that as a public request right now to have that as part of the official agenda when you folks meet.

1321
01:44:53,656 --> 01:44:56,038
Mr. President, I'm offering away the motion.

1322
01:44:56,586 --> 01:45:01,867
But this program of parking has many aspects, and I don't see the harm of asking.

1323
01:45:02,487 --> 01:45:06,908
On the motion of Councilor Marks that this be part of the meeting that we have.

1324
01:45:07,008 --> 01:45:07,828
All those in favor?

1325
01:45:08,488 --> 01:45:09,808
All those opposed?

1326
01:45:10,328 --> 01:45:10,768
Carries.

1327
01:45:15,009 --> 01:45:19,070
The records of the meeting of March 15, 2016 were passed to Councilor Marks.

1328
01:45:19,150 --> 01:45:20,710
Councilor Marks, how would you find those?

1329
01:45:20,730 --> 01:45:23,551
I ask that they be tabled, Mr. President.

1330
01:45:24,271 --> 01:45:24,651
I'm sorry?

1331
01:45:25,371 --> 01:45:26,111
I'd like to table them.

1332
01:45:26,696 --> 01:45:30,278
On motion, council marks the table the marked 15th records.

1333
01:45:30,318 --> 01:45:31,298
All those in favor?

1334
01:45:31,518 --> 01:45:32,499
All those against?

1335
01:45:32,519 --> 01:45:34,399
Records are tabled.

1336
01:45:40,442 --> 01:45:42,983
On motion for adjournment by Vice President Longo Kern.

1337
01:45:43,243 --> 01:45:44,144
All those in favor?

1338
01:45:44,924 --> 01:45:45,864
Oh, one more thing.

1339
01:45:47,085 --> 01:45:47,785
One more thing.

1340
01:45:49,146 --> 01:45:51,507
Citizen, please state your name and address for the record.

1341
01:45:52,277 --> 01:45:53,398
Thank you, Mr. President.

1342
01:45:53,578 --> 01:45:53,918
Welcome.

1343
01:45:54,219 --> 01:45:57,041
Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street and through the chair.

1344
01:45:57,101 --> 01:45:58,102
Thank you, Councillor Knight.

1345
01:46:01,564 --> 01:46:08,029
I was out to dinner the other night and a citizen sitting next to me has worked for the Lawrence Memorial Hospital for 23 years.

1346
01:46:08,590 --> 01:46:21,500
And I know the gentleman who spoke before me, Councillor Penta, when he was on this body, he brought up the merger that never went through and such.

1347
01:46:22,013 --> 01:46:34,003
But to be brief, this gentleman who worked for the Lawrence Memorial for 23 years has told me there's doctors that are leaving and that the hospital is up for sale.

1348
01:46:35,624 --> 01:46:50,696
If this body could, unless you know already, find out for sure what's going on so that the citizens of Medford know what's going on with their local hospital, the urgent care, the emergency care there, if in any way one of you councillors could

1349
01:46:51,157 --> 01:46:58,440
could possibly reach out to the current leadership of Hallmark and maybe have them come before this body to discuss it.

1350
01:46:59,321 --> 01:47:02,242
That would be highly appreciated.

1351
01:47:03,022 --> 01:47:03,963
Thank you, Mr. President.

1352
01:47:05,884 --> 01:47:07,324
I would move that forward.

1353
01:47:07,344 --> 01:47:09,185
I believe it's been- Could you give me some language?

1354
01:47:09,205 --> 01:47:09,945
Give me some language.

1355
01:47:11,186 --> 01:47:20,350
On the motion of Vice President Langel-Kern that the administration inquire with the hospital as to the status of its saleness or non-for-saleness.

1356
01:47:22,065 --> 01:47:22,685
Council Max.

1357
01:47:23,305 --> 01:47:32,187
And I just would like to recognize the last speaker, Mr. Capucci, just won the election as Republicans, uh, city committee person.

1358
01:47:32,787 --> 01:47:40,229
And I think he deserves a great round of applause for his tireless efforts on the motion of council along the turn for approval.

1359
01:47:40,289 --> 01:47:47,490
All those in favor, all those on the motion for adjournment by council along the current, all those in favor of meeting adjourned.
