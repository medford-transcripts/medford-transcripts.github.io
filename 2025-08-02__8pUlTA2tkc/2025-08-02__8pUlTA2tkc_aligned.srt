00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:12,931
Just one question.

10
00:01:14,153 --> 00:01:15,615
Why do you use fake weights?

11
00:01:18,588 --> 00:01:19,889
Plates not plates.

12
00:01:19,989 --> 00:01:26,333

13
00:01:26,413 --> 00:01:26,633

00:01:40,782 --> 00:01:41,202
The bar?

Like this?

18
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:57,332
I don't want to say to anyone, but I just see it looks like... I mean... There is like water or plastic?

19
00:01:57,392 --> 00:01:58,873
Just try it yourself.

20
00:02:01,675 --> 00:02:02,115
Like this?

21
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:05,777
But what if dumbbell will break the... No, no, no, not too far.

22
00:02:19,292 --> 00:02:20,172
What's happening guys?

23
00:02:21,493 --> 00:02:23,454
What's serious?

24
00:02:24,594 --> 00:02:25,835
What they give me permission to do?

25
00:02:33,306 --> 00:02:35,467
Nothing beats a jetty holiday.

26
00:02:35,527 --> 00:02:36,388
I'm like even music.

27
00:02:36,908 --> 00:02:37,148
Nice.

00:02:38,629 --> 00:02:38,849
Yeah?

30
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:39,669
Okay.

31
00:02:40,369 --> 00:02:49,073
Something like... I don't know, like... Honestly, like, just for me, it looks like... Like, not that real.

32
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:52,255
I don't know, like... Let me just hold them up, I will try.

33
00:02:52,595 --> 00:02:52,795
Okay?

34
00:03:01,123 --> 00:03:02,825
I usually do this lift, like this one.

35
00:03:03,605 --> 00:03:09,111
So, like this, and then like... What do you mean?

36
00:03:09,872 --> 00:03:15,317
You mean like, this is the... Just hold them up, please.

37
00:03:24,052 --> 00:03:25,092
No, this is the real.

38
00:03:25,252 --> 00:03:27,353
You're joking or not, but can I do this hand, please?

39
00:03:29,074 --> 00:03:37,177
Guys, it's okay, because you look at me like... I'll be just one hand and then I'll go.

40
00:03:38,877 --> 00:03:41,598
But if you hurt yourself, we are not responsible.

41
00:03:42,478 --> 00:03:42,858
Hurt what?

42
00:03:42,878 --> 00:03:45,419
If you want her back.

43
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,460
It's already broken.

44
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,320
Okay, bro.

45
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,501

No, no, it's fine.

51
00:04:26,243 --> 00:04:26,964
It's fine.

52
00:04:27,064 --> 00:04:28,846
Yeah!

53
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:30,147

00:05:50,703 --> 00:06:15,985

This is prank, yes?

63
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:28,176
You use like fake weights and... No, I'm not cheating.

64
00:06:28,196 --> 00:06:30,618
You put me with the mob of 50 people.

65
00:06:30,638 --> 00:06:30,618
50?

66
00:06:31,078 --> 00:06:32,299

67
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,901
You are like joking like on a prank here or something.

68
00:06:37,902 --> 00:06:38,102
Guys.

69
00:06:40,563 --> 00:06:41,424

00:06:42,404 --> 00:06:42,965
This is like good.

71
00:06:43,505 --> 00:06:45,006
If you want, you can try with the map as well.

72
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:47,207
Yeah, just try it.

73
00:06:56,445 --> 00:07:00,968
They give me this map and they tell me, like, it's heavy, but you're gonna get stronger.

74
00:07:01,488 --> 00:07:04,130
Who is this joke?

75
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:08,854
I have today, like, a really hard day, that's why I'm not laughing, but it's funny, nice, guys.

76
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:10,515
It's nice.

77
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,156
I will take it, it's okay.

78
00:07:13,216 --> 00:07:15,278
That's why sometimes I have to do some exercise.

79
00:07:15,298 --> 00:07:17,880
Like this, the same exercise.

80
00:07:25,237 --> 00:07:42,247
if you need any help if you need any help here guys just let me know I mean I don't think like I'm just I know it's not

81
00:07:44,853 --> 00:07:50,095
I cannot be like, guys, see like, this is like jumping.

82
00:07:50,515 --> 00:07:51,236
Have a good workout.

83
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,338
Just like regular, like day.

84
00:07:58,599 --> 00:07:59,639
I'm just like mapping.

85
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,761
I really appreciate trainer.

86
00:08:03,921 --> 00:08:04,582
Thank you very much.

87
00:08:38,687 --> 00:08:40,489
A year ago we did a social experiment.

88
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:48,820
We gathered 700 people from all over the world and the next 4 weeks all of them followed a training periodization method and a high collagen diet.

89
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:53,146
This was just 3 workouts per week, maximum 1-1.5 hour per session.

90
00:08:53,186 --> 00:08:55,970
And after 30 days the results shocked even myself.

91
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,931
I even felt like it's fake to be able to do this in 30 days.

92
00:09:00,011 --> 00:09:03,873
But I got all of the proofs in pictures and even the videos before and after.

93
00:09:04,073 --> 00:09:05,973
And this was the Anatoly Challenge.

94
00:09:06,193 --> 00:09:10,135
Guys, please, don't do all of these basic arms or calves workout.

95
00:09:10,255 --> 00:09:12,916
You just get a pump, look at the mirror, looks nice.

96
00:09:13,156 --> 00:09:15,857
But then 40 minutes after your workout, you look the same.

97
00:09:15,977 --> 00:09:17,117
The rules is very simple.

98
00:09:17,297 --> 00:09:19,978
Do only things which gets you closer to the progress.

99
00:09:20,158 --> 00:09:22,719
Adjust the load, I mean your training periodization now.

100
00:09:22,879 --> 00:09:25,459
Avoid overtraining, it's a really big problem in the industry.

101
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:31,521
And please, do exercises which really shock your body and increase, of course, your hormones and anabolism.

102
00:09:32,061 --> 00:09:35,781
That's what, guys, honestly, I am personally doing to be Anatoly.

103
00:09:35,961 --> 00:09:39,262
And more than 45,000 people already tried this.

104
00:09:39,462 --> 00:09:42,723
And the results speak for themselves right now, right here on the screen.

105
00:09:42,943 --> 00:09:47,545
Guys, I'm really proud to say that the link to join my training program will be in the description below.

113
00:10:34,215 --> 00:10:35,018
I'm just joking.

114
00:10:35,038 --> 00:10:37,388
Is it okay if I do it with you?

115
00:10:39,595 --> 00:10:41,195
Why are you laughing?

116
00:10:41,895 --> 00:10:42,376
No, no, don't worry.

117
00:10:42,396 --> 00:10:44,016
If you want to try, then try.

118
00:10:44,576 --> 00:10:48,537
I will join because you have three more sets and they're like... Yeah, yeah, if you want to try.

119
00:10:48,557 --> 00:10:48,777
Yeah?

120
00:10:48,797 --> 00:10:49,277
Okay.

121
00:10:49,297 --> 00:10:49,457
Okay.

122
00:10:49,477 --> 00:10:52,057
Okay, I'll just clean here a little bit.

123
00:10:52,898 --> 00:10:56,718
Can you like maybe show me some like technique or... So you want to go there?

124
00:10:57,378 --> 00:10:57,758
That side?

125
00:10:57,838 --> 00:10:57,939
Where?

126
00:10:57,979 --> 00:10:58,859
That side?

127
00:10:58,899 --> 00:10:59,659
The leg weight?

128
00:11:00,039 --> 00:11:00,839
You don't understand me.

129
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:05,160
If I want the same biceps like yours, I should do the same weight or... You can do it.

130
00:11:07,121 --> 00:11:28,516
but if i'll do like bait like i will be same like a girl looks like sometimes i'm doing exercising something like this but like i don't know i'm doing like like this i mean the real thing that's what i'm asking like can you just hold it

131
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:33,330
Why are you like... This is what I'm talking about.

132
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:36,051
I'm doing like this always, like, for biceps, like this.

133
00:11:39,133 --> 00:11:40,133
You can hold it.

134
00:11:44,015 --> 00:11:49,197
I am, like, never been with a girl, like, too close.

135
00:11:50,238 --> 00:11:55,020
It's always here some men and, like, you are here like flowers.

136
00:11:55,884 --> 00:11:56,685
I'm sorry for this.

137
00:11:57,365 --> 00:12:02,048
Like, by the chance, maybe I will show you something better for the apps.

138
00:12:03,449 --> 00:12:05,210

143
00:12:31,328 --> 00:12:39,295
So is it like something like this or... Or I should take something like heavier.

144
00:12:39,355 --> 00:12:40,496
I don't like now.

145
00:12:40,516 --> 00:12:43,658
Doctor from my home country, he tells me like this is not good.

146
00:12:44,119 --> 00:12:45,200
This is some problem like...

147

00:13:20,186 --> 00:13:22,568
Okay, this is like three by three.

151
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:30,993
My trainer told me this.

152
00:13:34,656 --> 00:13:35,777

153
00:13:37,797 --> 00:13:40,139

157
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:49,087
I mean, try it.

158
00:13:49,127 --> 00:13:51,269
You can try it.

159
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:56,194
This is like Samantha.

160
00:13:56,214 --> 00:13:57,035

161
00:13:59,457 --> 00:13:59,897
Are you sure?

00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:00,078

00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:11,355
By the way, this is my girlfriend.

166
00:14:11,975 --> 00:14:15,776
She's my trainer's girlfriend and in general, this is my love.

171
00:14:30,984 --> 00:14:31,785
