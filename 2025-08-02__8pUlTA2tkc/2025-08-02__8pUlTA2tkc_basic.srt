00:08:38,667 --> 00:08:56,150
A year ago we did a social experiment. We gathered 700 people from all over the world and the next 4 weeks all of them followed a training periodization method and a high collagen diet. This was just 3 workouts per week, maximum 1-1.5 hour per session. And after 30 days the results shocked even myself.

20
00:08:56,150 --> 00:09:20,078
I even felt like it's fake to be able to do this in 30 days. But I got all of the proofs in pictures and even the videos before and after. And this was the Anatoly Challenge. Guys, please, don't do all of these basic arms or calves workout. You just get a pump, look at the mirror, looks nice. But then 40 minutes after your workout, you look the same. The rules is very simple. Do only things which gets you closer to the progress.

21
00:09:20,078 --> 00:09:42,843
Adjust the load, I mean your training periodization now. Avoid overtraining, it's a really big problem in the industry. And please, do exercises which really shock your body and increase, of course, your hormones and anabolism. That's what, guys, honestly, I am personally doing to be Anatoly. And more than 45,000 people already tried this. And the results speak for themselves right now, right here on the screen.

22
00:09:42,843 --> 00:10:06,451
Guys, I'm really proud to say that the link to join my training program will be in the description below. So see you in the gym, be smart and stay strong. See you. Abs.

24
00:10:33,974 --> 00:10:38,733
I'm just joking. Is it okay if I do it with you?

25
00:10:39,475 --> 00:11:05,800
Why are you laughing? No, no, don't worry. If you want to try, then try. I will join because you have three more sets and they're like... Yeah, yeah, if you want to try. Yeah? Okay. Okay. Okay, I'll just clean here a little bit. Can you like maybe show me some like technique or... So you want to go there? That side? Where? That side? The leg weight? You don't understand me. If I want the same biceps like yours, I should do the same weight or... You can do it.
