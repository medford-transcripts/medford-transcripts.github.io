1
00:00:11,372 --> 00:00:19,294
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm Lisa Hughes from WBZ TV and it is an honor to be here today.

2
00:00:19,354 --> 00:00:28,377
[SPEAKER_11]: I had the pleasure of visiting the garden with Bill and Patty Campbell on Thursday and the greatest joy was to see their reaction.

3
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:39,436
[SPEAKER_11]: This park, the way it was designed, the attention to detail, the way so many people chipped in to raise the money to make it a reality, and the excitement.

4
00:00:40,316 --> 00:00:43,418
[SPEAKER_11]: It speaks to the power of what we can do when we work together.

5
00:00:44,038 --> 00:00:54,625
[SPEAKER_11]: When we form a circle around one another in the way that we did in 2013, in some of the darkest days in our community's history, and dedicate ourselves to making something good,

6
00:00:56,298 --> 00:01:05,941
[SPEAKER_11]: Crystal's legacy, and that of Sean, and Lindsay, and Mark, inspires us to be kind, to lift up one another.

7
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:17,524
[SPEAKER_11]: I now call upon the Medford Police Honor Guard, the MIT Honor Guard, and the Middlesex County Sheriff's Honor Guard to present the colors.

8
00:01:32,509 --> 00:01:38,375
[SPEAKER_11]: And now while we are all standing, please welcome the members of the Medford Ritalin to join us in the Pledge of Allegiance.

9
00:01:38,435 --> 00:01:38,855
[SPEAKER_11]: To the flag.

10
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:52,268
[SPEAKER_09]: We pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America.

11
00:01:53,157 --> 00:02:07,302
[SPEAKER_11]: Ladies and gentlemen, please remain standing while Stacey Clayton sings our National Anthem.

12
00:02:22,847 --> 00:02:47,021
[SPEAKER_08]: by the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming, whose broad stripes and bright stars

13
00:02:47,626 --> 00:03:04,407
[SPEAKER_08]: through the perilous fight, o'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?

14
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:31,377
[SPEAKER_08]: And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.

15
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:56,393
[SPEAKER_08]: O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free

16
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:03,727
[SPEAKER_08]: and the home of the brave?

17
00:05:20,277 --> 00:05:24,978
[SPEAKER_11]: That glorious noise was brought to you by the Bedford Strong Motorcycle Group.

18
00:05:25,738 --> 00:05:40,202
[SPEAKER_11]: A group that has been raising money for the establishment of Crystal Campus for the last four years.

19
00:05:40,342 --> 00:05:45,143
[SPEAKER_11]: And we draw on this memory so that we may have a moment of silence in the memory of Crystal and Shawn.

20
00:06:05,413 --> 00:06:18,543
[SPEAKER_13]: As we gather, let us pause and recognize that there are things much greater than ourselves, mysteries beyond us, questions impossible to answer.

21
00:06:20,605 --> 00:06:24,408
[SPEAKER_13]: The hardest questions to answer begin with the word why.

22
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:33,074
[SPEAKER_13]: Our thirst for the why of things is not quenched on this earth, but through the

23
00:06:37,727 --> 00:07:02,237
[SPEAKER_13]: These hints include things like sunflowers that turn their face always to the sun, water softly flowing yet hard enough to carve canyons, and most especially the inner courageous spirit of those among us who exemplify strength, dignity, leadership, love.

24
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:11,535
[SPEAKER_13]: people like Crystal Campbell, whose love reaches beyond her short time on earth and gathers us today.

25
00:07:13,917 --> 00:07:22,886
[SPEAKER_13]: As today we gaze upon this beautiful new garden, let us pray for Crystal and for Martin, Lingzi and Sean.

26
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,190
[SPEAKER_13]: We pray for all those injured.

27
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:38,762
[SPEAKER_13]: for all that responded, somehow running towards the scene rather than away from it, and for all of our families who remember.

28
00:07:40,383 --> 00:07:45,064
[SPEAKER_13]: Let us look upon God's creation and pray for deep peace.

29
00:07:47,444 --> 00:07:50,885
[SPEAKER_13]: Deep peace of running waves to you.

30
00:07:52,526 --> 00:07:56,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Deep peace of the flowing air to you.

31
00:07:57,934 --> 00:08:01,697
[SPEAKER_13]: Deep peace of the quiet earth to you.

32
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:07,102
[SPEAKER_13]: Deep peace of the shining stars to you.

33
00:08:09,184 --> 00:08:13,208
[SPEAKER_13]: Deep peace of the infinite peace to you.

34
00:08:19,262 --> 00:08:22,085
[SPEAKER_11]: And one of them is our Transportation Secretary, Stephanie Pollack.

35
00:08:22,285 --> 00:08:28,410
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would like to invite Madam Secretary to the podium to talk a little bit about her dedication and that of her team.

36
00:08:39,459 --> 00:08:41,541
[SPEAKER_12]: When you're in the transportation business,

37
00:08:43,294 --> 00:08:58,726
[SPEAKER_12]: You come to many intersections or bridges or stretches of road that have been dedicated in the memory of someone who was very important to many people, important enough for something to be gained for them.

38
00:08:59,627 --> 00:09:08,531
[SPEAKER_12]: And even before I was secretary, I was one of those people who would always read the little plaques on the bridges or at the intersections.

39
00:09:09,252 --> 00:09:15,655
[SPEAKER_12]: Because having a physical manifestation of those we have lost is really important to us.

40
00:09:16,675 --> 00:09:18,436
[SPEAKER_12]: It's important to know.

41
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:22,088
[SPEAKER_12]: that they won't be forgotten.

42
00:09:22,368 --> 00:09:34,560
[SPEAKER_12]: That's one of the things I think all of us who have lost a loved one share, is this deep-seated need to know that that very special person, that unbelievable soul, will live on.

43
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:41,366
[SPEAKER_12]: And the physical manifestation of the bridge or the intersection or the relieved road is important to us all.

44
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:50,503
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a rare thing, at least in my world, for that manifestation to be in the form of a garden, and in fact a peace garden.

45
00:09:50,783 --> 00:10:00,646
[SPEAKER_12]: And I will tell you that the men and women of NASDAQ are deeply honored to have been part of the construction of this peace garden.

46
00:10:00,706 --> 00:10:06,388
[SPEAKER_12]: It is a very different project from the kinds of projects that we undertake, but it is no less important.

47
00:10:06,528 --> 00:10:08,528
[SPEAKER_12]: than the other kinds of projects we do.

48
00:10:08,969 --> 00:10:27,533
[SPEAKER_12]: So I want to thank everyone, particularly Paul Stedman and the folks at Highway District 4, the folks from Daigle, the contractor who brought all of the pieces together in less than a year to bring the vision of this Peace Garden that was shared by so many people to a reality.

49
00:10:31,571 --> 00:10:57,143
[SPEAKER_12]: And it will mean not just for those who were lucky enough to know Crystal and Martin and Lindsay and Sean that they won't be forgotten, but it means those of us who never were lucky enough to know them will also have a place and a way to learn about them, to remember them, to honor not only the manner of their deaths, but the manner of their lives.

50
00:10:58,187 --> 00:11:06,913
[SPEAKER_12]: And in my faith, in the Jewish faith, this is the month before the Jewish New Year of Rosh Hashanah.

51
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:16,979
[SPEAKER_12]: And during that month, it is traditional to go visit the cemetery and to put a pebble or a stone on the grave of your loved ones.

52
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:18,460
[SPEAKER_12]: And the reason for that

53
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:27,002
[SPEAKER_12]: pebble is that way of saying, I was here and I haven't forgotten you.

54
00:11:27,182 --> 00:11:35,665
[SPEAKER_12]: So I say to the souls of Crystal, Agnes, Ian Martin, and Sean, we are here, we have not forgotten you.

55
00:11:35,745 --> 00:11:42,567
[SPEAKER_12]: We are honored to have all played some small part in the process of making this piece start to become a reality.

56
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:45,088
[SPEAKER_12]: And it will ensure, I hope,

57
00:11:45,908 --> 00:11:54,502
[SPEAKER_12]: that your souls rest in peace, that your loved ones find peace, and that all of us share in the peace that this garden represents.

58
00:11:54,602 --> 00:11:55,343
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

59
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:08,695
[SPEAKER_11]: I asked Patti Campbell the other day if it was really important that the word peace be in the name of the garden.

60
00:12:09,635 --> 00:12:18,743
[SPEAKER_11]: She said, yes, because it's the reason people move to this country, because they want their families to be safe, and because that's what we believe in.

61
00:12:18,763 --> 00:12:27,871
[SPEAKER_11]: And the next speaker we are about to hear from moved to this country while bathing in 2011 with his daughters and his wife.

62
00:12:28,812 --> 00:12:36,454
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuat Mbele was at the Marathon, as so many of us were in 2013, and today he would like to share his poetic interlude with us.

63
00:12:36,914 --> 00:12:37,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Please, Fuat.

64
00:12:47,377 --> 00:12:48,397
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everyone.

65
00:12:49,537 --> 00:12:52,858
[SPEAKER_01]: I am here, here at Duttonwood, American,

66
00:12:53,518 --> 00:12:55,499
[SPEAKER_01]: and my English not right.

67
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:58,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, sorry for my mistake.

68
00:13:04,465 --> 00:13:14,932
[SPEAKER_01]: We have gathered here today in the hope of peace for the Christians and all the other promised loves most.

69
00:13:16,573 --> 00:13:25,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Here her brother's city has come, praying for one of its own, her daughter in our hearts.

70
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:35,500
[SPEAKER_01]: At the forefront is your family, holding flowers in their hands, missing you, Christi, so much today and every day.

71
00:13:36,838 --> 00:13:48,924
[SPEAKER_01]: The city of Mansford built a park in honor of you and gave it your beautiful name, Crystal Campbell, surrounded by flowers and light.

72
00:13:49,924 --> 00:13:51,765
[SPEAKER_01]: It is truly a beautiful place.

73
00:13:53,026 --> 00:14:05,892
[SPEAKER_01]: It also unfortunately reminds us of the Boston Marathon bombing, the day when enormous, epic flowers bloomed, blood trickled down.

74
00:14:07,236 --> 00:14:12,897
[SPEAKER_01]: My heart was beating fast that day, worried for my one daughter.

75
00:14:14,217 --> 00:14:17,578
[SPEAKER_01]: She was watching the Boston Marathon nearby.

76
00:14:18,338 --> 00:14:21,619
[SPEAKER_01]: I worried she may have the same misfortune.

77
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:29,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Watching the marathon from the sidelines, you Christians were one of the unlucky ones.

78
00:14:30,361 --> 00:14:36,382
[SPEAKER_01]: And we will always remember you in every flower's bloom.

79
00:14:37,352 --> 00:14:44,534
[SPEAKER_01]: We come to this park every day, giving yourself time to heal, getting over a broken heart.

80
00:14:45,114 --> 00:14:54,637
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter who you are or who you represent, we thank everyone while praying for Christians and others.

81
00:14:56,358 --> 00:15:06,741
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, the blood still trickles down all around the world for no reason, and all high

82
00:15:07,627 --> 00:15:11,770
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear his crystal voice to ask love and peace.

83
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:13,992
[SPEAKER_01]: Please, God bless.

84
00:15:14,753 --> 00:15:15,493
[SPEAKER_01]: Boston Strong.

85
00:15:24,901 --> 00:15:28,544
[SPEAKER_11]: Our next speaker is one of those people who never truly rests.

86
00:15:29,224 --> 00:15:36,070
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, in addition to running the Jimmy Fund Walk today, he ran the entire Boston Marathon this morning.

87
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,120
[SPEAKER_11]: He is a Medford native.

88
00:15:40,141 --> 00:15:43,622
[SPEAKER_11]: He is the BAA Boston Marathon race director.

89
00:15:43,702 --> 00:15:45,862
[SPEAKER_11]: And my dear friend, please welcome Dave McGowan.

90
00:15:55,105 --> 00:16:00,187
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I thought it was great that the Method Little League kids were here doing the Pledge of Allegiance.

91
00:16:00,307 --> 00:16:01,987
[SPEAKER_02]: I played for the Method Little League, too.

92
00:16:02,547 --> 00:16:04,068
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't grown an inch since then.

93
00:16:08,615 --> 00:16:09,176
[SPEAKER_02]: why I run.

94
00:16:10,417 --> 00:16:26,230
[SPEAKER_02]: On behalf of the Boston Athletic Association, the Boston Marathon, and all the runners around the world, I want to thank both Mayor Burke and Mayor Glenn for inviting me to this very special occasion.

95
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:36,119
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't imagine the pain one feels from the loss of their child.

96
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:51,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I have five children myself and I love them more than anything in the world the way Crystal's parents loved Crystal.

97
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:58,315
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's fitting that this Peace Garden represent the Boston Marathon course.

98
00:16:58,895 --> 00:17:06,400
[SPEAKER_02]: As Lisa said, this morning I ran the entire marathon course in memory of Crystal.

99
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:11,493
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to, I had to reflect.

100
00:17:13,754 --> 00:17:24,959
[SPEAKER_02]: I never met Crystal personally, but I felt she was with me every step of the way this morning, as were Martin and Lindsay and Sean.

101
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:37,325
[SPEAKER_02]: This garden is a fitting tribute to Crystal, Sunflower, Martin, Baseball Glove, Lindsay,

102
00:17:38,643 --> 00:17:42,065
[SPEAKER_02]: books, and Sean Badge.

103
00:17:43,826 --> 00:17:47,889
[SPEAKER_02]: April 15, 2013 impacted so many of us.

104
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:56,274
[SPEAKER_02]: In the past three years, I've traveled the world, and everyone remembers that day.

105
00:17:56,915 --> 00:17:59,356
[SPEAKER_02]: The entire world was impacted.

106
00:17:59,857 --> 00:18:01,958
[SPEAKER_02]: The running community was impacted.

107
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:07,682
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also experienced resolve and perseverance

108
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:12,854
[SPEAKER_02]: an amazing will to stay strong.

109
00:18:14,696 --> 00:18:20,122
[SPEAKER_02]: This very area of the city of Medford is very special to me personally.

110
00:18:21,403 --> 00:18:24,527
[SPEAKER_02]: I was born and grew up right down the road from here.

111
00:18:26,282 --> 00:18:38,205
[SPEAKER_02]: 38 years and one month ago, I finished running across the United States from Method, Oregon to Method, Massachusetts for the Jimmy Fund right over there.

112
00:18:38,545 --> 00:18:53,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen a city rally behind one cause more than the city of Method did that

113
00:18:56,325 --> 00:18:56,965
[SPEAKER_02]: until now.

114
00:18:58,526 --> 00:19:07,531
[SPEAKER_02]: And although you might be able to take me out of Medford, you can never take Medford out of me.

115
00:19:12,974 --> 00:19:24,741
[SPEAKER_02]: How wonderful it is that you, my hometown, have done this for the Campbell family, for Martin, Lindsay, Sean, and all the survivors, and for all of us.

116
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:29,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Patrick Down, a Boston Marathon survivor, said it best.

117
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:37,666
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, he refuses to see himself as a victim of violence, but rather as an ambassador for peace.

118
00:19:38,447 --> 00:19:46,313
[SPEAKER_02]: Peace has never been about the absence of evil, he said, rather the existence of the good in all of us.

119
00:19:47,313 --> 00:19:51,236
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what this Peace Garden truly represents.

120
00:19:52,157 --> 00:19:55,980
[SPEAKER_02]: And Martin wrote, no more hurting, peace,

121
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,070
[SPEAKER_02]: He was right.

122
00:19:59,271 --> 00:20:01,513
[SPEAKER_02]: No more hurting.

123
00:20:03,774 --> 00:20:05,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Three quick stories of recovery.

124
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:12,480
[SPEAKER_02]: That day, my eight-year-old son, Mike Martin, was sitting at the finish line in the bleachers.

125
00:20:12,641 --> 00:20:14,222
[SPEAKER_02]: He saw everything.

126
00:20:15,042 --> 00:20:18,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Two days after the marathon, I went home, and I saw my son.

127
00:20:18,925 --> 00:20:20,446
[SPEAKER_02]: And he came up to me, and he hugged me.

128
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:25,950
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, Dad, I never, ever, ever want you to direct that race again.

129
00:20:28,632 --> 00:20:31,414
[SPEAKER_02]: He associated danger with my job.

130
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:33,615
[SPEAKER_02]: I put on a road race.

131
00:20:35,937 --> 00:20:36,818
[SPEAKER_02]: He persevered.

132
00:20:37,558 --> 00:20:38,339
[SPEAKER_02]: He worked hard.

133
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:40,060
[SPEAKER_02]: He processed.

134
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,184
[SPEAKER_02]: Two months later, he came up to me and he said, Dad, remember I told you I never want you to direct that race again?

135
00:20:46,404 --> 00:20:48,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, yes, Luke, I remember.

136
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,086
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, you know why?

137
00:20:49,546 --> 00:20:50,107
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, why?

138
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:56,951
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, because I want to direct it.

139
00:20:56,971 --> 00:20:57,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff Baumann.

140
00:20:58,598 --> 00:21:04,404
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked Jeff a few months ago if he'd come and run in a one-mile celebrity race I was putting on.

141
00:21:05,144 --> 00:21:06,946
[SPEAKER_02]: To my surprise, he said he would do it.

142
00:21:07,927 --> 00:21:09,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff trained like you wouldn't believe.

143
00:21:10,329 --> 00:21:12,732
[SPEAKER_02]: He was determined to do this mile.

144
00:21:13,112 --> 00:21:14,533
[SPEAKER_02]: He'd never run a race in his life.

145
00:21:15,655 --> 00:21:16,235
[SPEAKER_02]: He trained.

146
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,098
[SPEAKER_02]: He would email me and say, I'm training hard, Dave, for this race.

147
00:21:19,598 --> 00:21:20,619
[SPEAKER_02]: He showed up at the race.

148
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,801
[SPEAKER_02]: One mile, two laps.

149
00:21:23,843 --> 00:21:29,106
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden, I looked to my right as I was introducing all the celebrities, and there was Carlos Arredondo.

150
00:21:30,006 --> 00:21:34,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Carlos helped save Jeff, as you saw in that iconic picture.

151
00:21:34,428 --> 00:21:36,349
[SPEAKER_02]: I asked Carlos, do you want to do the celebrity mile too?

152
00:21:36,389 --> 00:21:37,010
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, sure.

153
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,191
[SPEAKER_02]: But Carlos was in a wheelchair.

154
00:21:39,451 --> 00:21:41,672
[SPEAKER_02]: He had just injured his leg and was in a cast.

155
00:21:41,932 --> 00:21:43,653
[SPEAKER_02]: He had someone pushing him.

156
00:21:43,673 --> 00:21:44,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Long story short,

157
00:21:45,314 --> 00:21:49,637
[SPEAKER_02]: who did that first half mile, and then Jeff was the very last person.

158
00:21:49,777 --> 00:21:52,319
[SPEAKER_02]: All the celebrities had finished, and Jeff still had a lap to go.

159
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:58,503
[SPEAKER_02]: Every celebrity jumped into the race behind Jeff and walked with Jeff the last half mile.

160
00:21:59,503 --> 00:22:01,504
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden, we're coming towards the finish.

161
00:22:02,845 --> 00:22:04,226
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy's pushing Carlos.

162
00:22:04,626 --> 00:22:05,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff turns to me.

163
00:22:05,447 --> 00:22:08,069
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, Dave, do you mind?

164
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,251
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to push Carlos.

165
00:22:13,352 --> 00:22:14,433
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave me his cane.

166
00:22:15,295 --> 00:22:18,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff pushed Carlos across the finish line.

167
00:22:19,416 --> 00:22:20,976
[SPEAKER_02]: Three years later, Republic.

168
00:22:25,097 --> 00:22:27,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, Patrick Downs.

169
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:29,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at the Disney Marathon in January.

170
00:22:30,238 --> 00:22:31,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I was standing at the start.

171
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:32,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a tap on my shoulder.

172
00:22:32,539 --> 00:22:33,319
[SPEAKER_02]: I looked behind me.

173
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:35,140
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, oh, hi, Patrick.

174
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,360
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing here?

175
00:22:38,380 --> 00:22:41,021
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, well, I'm running in the half marathon.

176
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,147
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, you're running in the half marathon?

177
00:22:44,769 --> 00:22:45,251
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, yeah.

178
00:22:45,773 --> 00:22:46,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, but you just.

179
00:22:48,347 --> 00:22:48,967
[SPEAKER_02]: I couldn't believe it.

180
00:22:49,527 --> 00:22:50,828
[SPEAKER_02]: He's running in the half marathon.

181
00:22:51,508 --> 00:22:56,889
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran the marathon, the half marathon, I finished, and I went into a tent, waited for Jeff.

182
00:22:57,009 --> 00:22:58,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I get another tap on my shoulder.

183
00:22:59,069 --> 00:23:01,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I look, I said, oh, hi, Jeff.

184
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:04,070
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Patrick's wife, Jess.

185
00:23:04,891 --> 00:23:06,851
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, so why are you here?

186
00:23:07,351 --> 00:23:10,012
[SPEAKER_02]: She said, well, I just ran the half marathon.

187
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,272
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, you ran the half marathon?

188
00:23:12,292 --> 00:23:13,893
[SPEAKER_02]: She said, yeah, on a hand cycle.

189
00:23:14,273 --> 00:23:15,233
[SPEAKER_02]: She lost both legs.

190
00:23:17,048 --> 00:23:18,289
[SPEAKER_02]: We waited for Patrick.

191
00:23:18,349 --> 00:23:34,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Patrick came in, I shook his hand, and Patrick turned to me and he said, Dave, I want you to tell all those people in Boston how much we appreciate all their support and how much they are an inspiration to all of us.

192
00:23:35,944 --> 00:23:39,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, Patrick, I think you have it backwards.

193
00:23:42,025 --> 00:23:42,545
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine.

194
00:23:43,085 --> 00:23:50,927
[SPEAKER_02]: So those who have been impacted have actually inspired us more than we have inspired them.

195
00:23:52,088 --> 00:24:00,550
[SPEAKER_02]: So finally, to Crystal's parents and to your family, you will always be in our thoughts and prayers.

196
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:10,672
[SPEAKER_02]: We will always remember Crystal as this Peace Garden will keep her memory and her beautiful smile alive forever.

197
00:24:11,685 --> 00:24:22,349
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't have a lot to give, but what I do have that I want to give to the Crystal family is my Boston Marathon medal from 2013.

198
00:24:22,469 --> 00:24:35,934
[SPEAKER_02]: It symbolizes friendship, resolve, and most importantly, peace.

199
00:24:38,215 --> 00:24:38,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

200
00:24:49,067 --> 00:25:00,235
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a place that I know, where the sick and the wounds grow.

201
00:25:01,476 --> 00:25:10,083
[SPEAKER_08]: And amphitheatres have their fun.

202
00:25:10,883 --> 00:25:13,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Where the cares of the day seem to slowly fade away.

203
00:25:15,050 --> 00:25:40,575
[SPEAKER_08]: And the glow of the evening sun Leaves when the day is done If I get there late, let my mind meditate On everything to be done

204
00:25:43,947 --> 00:25:56,882
[SPEAKER_08]: If I search deep inside, let my conscience be my guide, then the answers are sure to come.

205
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:02,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't have to worry now.

206
00:26:07,036 --> 00:26:25,966
[SPEAKER_08]: When you find peace of mind, leave your worries behind, and don't say that it can't be done.

207
00:26:26,787 --> 00:26:34,971
[SPEAKER_08]: With a new point of view, life's true meaning comes to you, and the freedom you seek is won.

208
00:26:40,274 --> 00:26:43,076
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace is for everyone.

209
00:26:43,116 --> 00:26:48,061
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace is for everyone.

210
00:26:48,181 --> 00:26:54,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Peace is for everyone.

211
00:27:19,356 --> 00:27:32,869
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, a little over a year ago, when former Mayor Michael Flynn asked if I would join him in a group of people at a fundraiser that I'm sure many of you attended, the goal was to raise $15,000 for this park.

212
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:37,994
[SPEAKER_11]: And by the time the night was over, we had more than tripled.

213
00:27:42,713 --> 00:27:54,385
[SPEAKER_11]: The former mayor had a vision for this park that is so incredibly well realized that it is as if someone took the rendering and put a photo of what's here today right in front of us.

214
00:27:54,465 --> 00:28:00,532
[SPEAKER_11]: It was an amazing vision, and on behalf of everybody here, I don't think we can thank you enough, but we do want to hear from you.

215
00:28:00,592 --> 00:28:01,553
[SPEAKER_11]: Former Mayor Mike McGlynn.

216
00:28:16,312 --> 00:28:18,232
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome, everyone, and thank you.

217
00:28:20,253 --> 00:28:43,857
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm excited, as I see the faces in the crowd, of those who worked, volunteered, and donated to fulfill the vision for this space, which was a combination of ideas, but with a single goal of celebrating the lives of Martin Richards, Sean Foyer, Lise Lu, and Crystal Campbell.

218
00:28:45,086 --> 00:29:08,050
[SPEAKER_09]: to celebrate the survivors who have overcome devastating challenges, to lead the healing process with grace and strength and compassion, and to celebrate our first responders, public safety officials, citizen volunteers, the National Guard, fellow runners, BAA staff and hospital personnel,

219
00:29:09,479 --> 00:29:16,665
[SPEAKER_09]: for their immediate and selfless heroic actions, and who are responsible for saving many additional lives.

220
00:29:18,106 --> 00:29:30,377
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank Mayor Stephanie Muccini-Burke for her leadership in shepherding this project through to fruition, and Secretary Stephanie Pollack for making this day a reality.

221
00:29:32,027 --> 00:29:34,989
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you to those who helped kick off the fundraising drive.

222
00:29:35,869 --> 00:29:59,083
[SPEAKER_09]: President Anthony Monaco from Tufts University, Bill Cummings from the Cummings Foundation, Bob DiSalvio of Winn-Boston, the state and federal government, along with hundreds who generously gave nearly $1.5 million to build and maintain the Crystal Campbell Peace Guard.

223
00:30:00,293 --> 00:30:08,376
[SPEAKER_09]: People have been supportive and determined not to let Crystal's passion and energy for life that would be forgotten.

224
00:30:09,297 --> 00:30:13,198
[SPEAKER_09]: The celebration of her life continues.

225
00:30:13,298 --> 00:30:28,665
[SPEAKER_09]: On April 15, 2013, was a devastating and tragic day, but also a time when people came together to support one another with a renewed commitment for a better quality of life for all.

226
00:30:29,898 --> 00:30:33,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Their spirit is what this Peace Garden represents.

227
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:51,640
[SPEAKER_09]: People came together to redesign and reconstruct this land as not only a part of the healing process, but also as a memorial to the four people who reached out in their own way to spread peace upon the earth.

228
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:59,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Sean Collier was a police officer, providing a safe environment for faculty and staff.

229
00:31:00,803 --> 00:31:09,389
[SPEAKER_09]: Martin Richard, who at a young age, ministered to us all, preaching a message of stop hurting people.

230
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:15,634
[SPEAKER_09]: Lingzi Lu, through education and music, sought a better quality of life for many.

231
00:31:16,847 --> 00:31:23,570
[SPEAKER_09]: and Crystal Campbell, a leader who nurtured her friends and guided and supported her co-workers.

232
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:28,272
[SPEAKER_09]: We have all heard the loving stories of their actions.

233
00:31:29,933 --> 00:31:33,435
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a hymn entitled, Go Make a Difference.

234
00:31:33,455 --> 00:31:40,018
[SPEAKER_09]: One line states, we are the salt of the earth.

235
00:31:40,118 --> 00:31:43,720
[SPEAKER_09]: All that the people see is the love of God in you and me.

236
00:31:45,875 --> 00:31:48,480
[SPEAKER_09]: They went forth and made a difference.

237
00:31:49,021 --> 00:31:55,552
[SPEAKER_09]: And every time their story is told, here or elsewhere, they will continue to make a difference.

238
00:31:56,727 --> 00:32:17,443
[SPEAKER_09]: When you walk down Clippership Drive, and read the marathon mile markers, and continue to the fountain, and see the flack of Sean's police badge, baseball gloves, glitzy loose books, or crystal sunflowers, you cannot help but be inspired and comforted by their message.

239
00:32:18,684 --> 00:32:24,048
[SPEAKER_09]: For generations to come, this message will be spread over and over again.

240
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:32,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you to Pam Shadley and Skylar Chick of Shadley Associates for all of their hard work on the design.

241
00:32:33,322 --> 00:32:42,624
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you to President Maureen for her thanks to the electric field for the construction and reconstruction of this site.

242
00:32:43,444 --> 00:32:49,345
[SPEAKER_09]: When the finished product looks exactly like the design picture, you know it's a job well done.

243
00:32:50,784 --> 00:32:56,209
[SPEAKER_09]: And I must thank the crew who work daily with me on this magnificent site.

244
00:32:57,209 --> 00:33:10,180
[SPEAKER_09]: Laura DiLorenzo, Mark Rumley, Clodagh Stoker-Long, Lisa Evangelista, Medford's own Frankie DePaola, Tom Tidland, Paul Stedman, and Paul Malloy.

245
00:33:11,581 --> 00:33:18,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Two and a half years ago, our nation was once again challenged by the forces of evil in our world.

246
00:33:19,353 --> 00:33:25,364
[SPEAKER_09]: We have all shared a profound sense of grief for those we lost and for those who loved them.

247
00:33:26,385 --> 00:33:30,172
[SPEAKER_09]: But when we think of the lives of Lindsey, Crystal, Martin, and Sean,

248
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,403
[SPEAKER_09]: we think of what they accomplished.

249
00:33:34,524 --> 00:33:45,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Our response to the forces of evil is to celebrate their lives in a unified voice and let it be known that the American spirit is unbroken.

250
00:33:46,737 --> 00:33:51,282
[SPEAKER_09]: We energetically embrace our future, our freedom, and our way of life.

251
00:33:52,729 --> 00:33:54,250
[SPEAKER_09]: We celebrate Crystal's life.

252
00:33:55,171 --> 00:34:00,515
[SPEAKER_09]: She was a Medford Mustang class of 2001, an alumnus of UMass Boston.

253
00:34:01,415 --> 00:34:06,739
[SPEAKER_09]: Crystal was a member of the Medford High School band and the girls' softball team.

254
00:34:06,839 --> 00:34:11,943
[SPEAKER_09]: We celebrate her ongoing, fun-loving, deeply passionate, and energetic life.

255
00:34:13,264 --> 00:34:15,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Crystal lived life to the fullest.

256
00:34:16,546 --> 00:34:23,713
[SPEAKER_09]: She touched the hearts and souls of not only family and friends, but hearts and souls throughout the world.

257
00:34:24,794 --> 00:34:25,695
[SPEAKER_09]: She loved people.

258
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:39,608
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure she is watching us now displaying that million-dollar smile and thinking about all the new friendships that have resulted from everyone working together on the Peace Guard.

259
00:34:40,893 --> 00:34:50,735
[SPEAKER_09]: We can only imagine how many more will develop over the years as people come to this site to relax, to view, and to listen to the fountains.

260
00:34:52,175 --> 00:35:07,058
[SPEAKER_09]: When this project began, Bill Campbell, Bristol's dad, said he could not wait until it was finished so he could bring his grandson, Billy III, and enjoy his company in the beauty of this park.

261
00:35:09,882 --> 00:35:10,663
[SPEAKER_09]: The word is out.

262
00:35:10,683 --> 00:35:13,565
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have a lot of company.

263
00:35:14,546 --> 00:35:15,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Let there be peace on Earth.

264
00:35:15,666 --> 00:35:17,528
[SPEAKER_09]: And let it begin with me.

265
00:35:18,609 --> 00:35:22,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Let there be peace on Earth, the peace that was meant to be.

266
00:35:23,573 --> 00:35:29,317
[SPEAKER_09]: May God bless us and provide us the strength to persevere, to heal, and to love.

267
00:35:29,677 --> 00:35:30,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

268
00:35:39,591 --> 00:35:44,239
[SPEAKER_11]: This time, we're now playing Walk the Rainwater, the first of a new version of A Foster Nurse.

269
00:38:17,523 --> 00:38:42,077
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to use a little bit like applause to kind of get that going.

270
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:56,982
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one thing to have an amazing vision, and then to take over that vision, and as we would say on a Sunday, take it over the bowl and execute on what was there before you with the passion and dedication that Mayor Burke has.

271
00:38:57,022 --> 00:39:12,868
[SPEAKER_11]: This was truly a labor of love for so many people, and even on Thursday, when one of the workers was here and so kindly turned on the fountains for us so we could put some video on television, it was clear that there was tremendous pride in what's here now.

272
00:39:14,005 --> 00:39:18,650
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's an eagerness to share it with all of you and people who have come here for generations.

273
00:39:19,591 --> 00:39:26,218
[SPEAKER_11]: Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the woman who helped get this to the finish line, the clear hearted soul into a real stepping stone.

274
00:39:38,578 --> 00:39:52,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Good afternoon dignitaries, clergy, friends, survivors, first responders, and especially the families of Crystal, Martin, Lindsey, and John.

275
00:39:52,612 --> 00:40:02,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Your strength and courage since September, April 15, 2013 has given us the ability to come together to heal from that traumatic time in the Commonwealth's history.

276
00:40:03,593 --> 00:40:06,134
[SPEAKER_10]: As a community, we share in your sorrow.

277
00:40:06,995 --> 00:40:09,236
[SPEAKER_10]: As a community, we share in your healing.

278
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:11,877
[SPEAKER_10]: And as a community, we are hopeful.

279
00:40:13,058 --> 00:40:28,706
[SPEAKER_10]: We are hopeful that this special place in our city, a living memorial that countless individuals, entities contributed to, to bring to fruition, is a testament to the longing we all have for a peaceful, reflective space.

280
00:40:30,401 --> 00:40:38,072
[SPEAKER_10]: I thank former Mayor Michael McGlynn for his vision and fortitude to plan this garden, which sits just a few blocks from the Campbell's residence.

281
00:40:39,561 --> 00:40:48,825
[SPEAKER_10]: I thank Secretary Pollack, Highway Administrator Tom Tinlin, and their team for their expertise and funding to assist in this project.

282
00:40:48,865 --> 00:40:55,028
[SPEAKER_10]: And I thank the Dagles, Pam Shadley, and all city departments for their work and oversight.

283
00:40:55,728 --> 00:41:02,591
[SPEAKER_10]: We, the city and state, are a shepherd for this beautiful Peace Garden on behalf of all of those who gave us so much.

284
00:41:04,401 --> 00:41:18,231
[SPEAKER_10]: As versed by the Dalai Lama, when we meet real tragedy in life, we can react in two ways, either by losing hope and following self-destructive habits, or by using the challenge to find our inner strength.

285
00:41:19,272 --> 00:41:32,662
[SPEAKER_10]: In the days, weeks, and years following the horrific events, these families, first responders, and survivors have demonstrated pure strength by their actions and words seen and heard around the world.

286
00:41:33,906 --> 00:41:39,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Who can forget the words by Rob Rogers during his eulogy of his brother Sean Collier?

287
00:41:39,848 --> 00:41:41,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Live long like he would.

288
00:41:42,169 --> 00:41:48,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Big hearts, big smiles, big service, all love.

289
00:41:48,831 --> 00:41:57,615
[SPEAKER_10]: Who can forget Mr. Bill Richard's remarks during a recent dedication of a statue to his son Marvin at his and his wife Denise's alma mater, Bridgewater State University?

290
00:41:58,635 --> 00:42:03,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Reminder to all, unlike the past, the story of the future is not yet written.

291
00:42:04,683 --> 00:42:06,806
[SPEAKER_10]: Martin's message of peace will live on.

292
00:42:07,847 --> 00:42:15,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Our hope is for Martin's legacy to live on through today's children and to show that no matter the age, you can always choose kindness.

293
00:42:18,355 --> 00:42:22,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Who can forget Zheng Lu's expression at a memorial mass for his daughter, Lingzi?

294
00:42:23,357 --> 00:42:31,441
[SPEAKER_10]: An ancient Chinese saying says, every child is actually a little Buddha that helps their parents mature and grow up.

295
00:42:31,721 --> 00:42:45,768
[SPEAKER_10]: Even though we brought up Lingzi, and yet today, while reflecting on her short, 24-year life, we as parents admire and appreciate her kindness, courage, and her yearning for a beautiful life.

296
00:42:47,254 --> 00:42:53,957
[SPEAKER_10]: and who can forget Mr. Campbell's humble comments following the groundbreaking of this Garden of Peace.

297
00:42:55,078 --> 00:42:56,399
[SPEAKER_10]: But the weight is lifted.

298
00:42:57,159 --> 00:42:58,700
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a rejoicing now.

299
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,341
[SPEAKER_10]: No more sorrow.

300
00:43:00,841 --> 00:43:02,722
[SPEAKER_10]: You couldn't ask for any better.

301
00:43:03,542 --> 00:43:04,963
[SPEAKER_10]: Crystal would have loved it.

302
00:43:05,703 --> 00:43:09,705
[SPEAKER_10]: We're so lucky to have a community of people hearing so much.

303
00:43:10,326 --> 00:43:12,467
[SPEAKER_10]: It's overwhelming, just beautiful.

304
00:43:14,211 --> 00:43:27,196
[SPEAKER_10]: To the Colliers, Lews, Richards, and Campbells, we are so proud to honor the memories of Sean, Lindsey, Martin, and Crystal, and remember the positive impact that they had on all of us.

305
00:43:28,496 --> 00:43:34,519
[SPEAKER_10]: To the survivors, the courage, strength, and bond you built is an inspiration to all of us.

306
00:43:35,719 --> 00:43:42,842
[SPEAKER_10]: To the first responders and ordinary people that ran to instead of from, you are our heroes.

307
00:43:47,036 --> 00:43:55,842
[SPEAKER_10]: We all must remember that this Peace Garden not only signifies their memory, but also our commitment to observing peace every day.

308
00:43:56,742 --> 00:44:12,832
[SPEAKER_10]: With this unveiling in the shadow of the International Day of Peace this past Wednesday, we must always remember Martin's message conveyed through a simple drawing of red full hearts and the words, no more hurting people.

309
00:44:13,533 --> 00:44:13,753
[SPEAKER_10]: Peace.

310
00:44:14,613 --> 00:44:15,254
[SPEAKER_10]: God bless you all.

311
00:44:23,472 --> 00:44:30,835
[SPEAKER_11]: In just a moment, Mayor Burke will join the families for the dedications of the plaques, but first, I would like to welcome to the podium U.S.

312
00:44:30,875 --> 00:44:31,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Senator Ed Markey.

313
00:44:31,536 --> 00:44:31,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

314
00:44:31,896 --> 00:44:51,405
[SPEAKER_14]: To the Campbell family, to the Paulga family, to the Richard family,

315
00:44:56,759 --> 00:44:59,040
[SPEAKER_14]: We honor you today.

316
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:06,602
[SPEAKER_14]: We honor the memory of the sacrifice which your family has made.

317
00:45:06,722 --> 00:45:08,743
[SPEAKER_14]: That is why we are here.

318
00:45:10,184 --> 00:45:19,707
[SPEAKER_14]: And the great poet Milan Kundera said that the challenge in life

319
00:45:29,325 --> 00:45:32,607
[SPEAKER_14]: What we say here today is that we remember.

320
00:45:33,808 --> 00:45:48,659
[SPEAKER_14]: What we say here today is that we will never forget what happened on that day, three and a half years ago.

321
00:45:48,699 --> 00:45:53,203
[SPEAKER_14]: Mayor McGlynn, you had a dream, you had a concept.

322
00:45:53,223 --> 00:45:55,885
[SPEAKER_14]: You understand patriotism.

323
00:45:57,886 --> 00:45:58,867
[SPEAKER_14]: We just celebrated

324
00:46:00,493 --> 00:46:10,077
[SPEAKER_14]: The life of your great father, Jack O'Lynn, two weeks ago, that great patriot who served us in World War II, and that ghost brigade.

325
00:46:10,177 --> 00:46:21,981
[SPEAKER_14]: And we know how much this means to you, how dedicated you have been throughout your entire life, making sure that those who sacrificed here in Bedford are remembered.

326
00:46:23,807 --> 00:46:31,031
[SPEAKER_14]: And Mayor Burke, you as well, you have taken this concept and brought it to a perfect execution.

327
00:46:32,772 --> 00:46:40,957
[SPEAKER_14]: Something that will stand here forever to help everyone remember what happened here.

328
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:52,744
[SPEAKER_14]: And the wonderful thing about today is that we are going to remember the indomitable spirit of Crystal.

329
00:46:53,957 --> 00:46:58,039
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're also going to remember Martin Richard.

330
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,121
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's a baseball glove, a little boy that we're going to see.

331
00:47:03,141 --> 00:47:08,204
[SPEAKER_14]: I took a little sneak preview of him right there next to his name.

332
00:47:08,564 --> 00:47:10,205
[SPEAKER_14]: At this point, he talked about peace.

333
00:47:12,145 --> 00:47:17,108
[SPEAKER_14]: And next to Sean Collier, a badge.

334
00:47:17,128 --> 00:47:19,889
[SPEAKER_14]: He was a peace officer.

335
00:47:19,949 --> 00:47:20,689
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what he did.

336
00:47:22,479 --> 00:47:23,680
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a Peace Garden.

337
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:40,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Lindsay Liu, an international student who came here to this land of the free and the home of the brave, we celebrate that here today as well.

338
00:47:47,434 --> 00:47:51,715
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, I just want to mention that we have with us here the great mayor of the city of Boston.

339
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:53,156
[SPEAKER_14]: We have Marty Malt, who is here today.

340
00:47:53,576 --> 00:47:57,697
[SPEAKER_14]: What about a clap for the folks?

341
00:47:59,158 --> 00:48:01,119
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be so great for them to be here.

342
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:04,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Our great congresswoman, Kathleen Clark, who is here today.

343
00:48:09,083 --> 00:48:19,851
[SPEAKER_14]: And Stephanie Pollack, the Secretary of Transportation, who did such a fantastic job in making sure that such a thing of beauty would be here forever.

344
00:48:21,452 --> 00:48:23,494
[SPEAKER_14]: So Crystal grew up here in Medford.

345
00:48:24,535 --> 00:48:29,579
[SPEAKER_14]: And Patriot's Day is a very special day in Medford.

346
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:37,084
[SPEAKER_14]: Paul Revere looked up in the Old Law Church to see if it was

347
00:48:39,061 --> 00:48:42,142
[SPEAKER_14]: One at my land, two at my sea.

348
00:48:42,923 --> 00:48:47,865
[SPEAKER_14]: And then he began his ride, captured by Longfellow.

349
00:48:47,965 --> 00:49:00,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Every Patriot's Day, as Paul Revere would ride through Lenton Square, and Crystal would see Paul Revere, as we all did growing up.

350
00:49:01,110 --> 00:49:06,152
[SPEAKER_14]: As he stopped just 200 yards from here, where we had our Patriot's Day ceremony.

351
00:49:08,285 --> 00:49:17,732
[SPEAKER_14]: has been celebrating the patriots of Metric, the Minutemen who came out to fight for liberty back in 1775.

352
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:20,754
[SPEAKER_14]: That is what the marathon celebrates.

353
00:49:21,094 --> 00:49:35,345
[SPEAKER_14]: It celebrates Patriot's Day, where one million people from Massachusetts come together to celebrate that day, where the people of these villages, like Metric, stood up for freedom.

354
00:49:36,996 --> 00:49:42,261
[SPEAKER_14]: So that is commemorated every single year here in Bedford.

355
00:49:42,781 --> 00:49:52,090
[SPEAKER_14]: On these streets that Crystal walked every day of her life, we celebrated that freedom.

356
00:49:54,372 --> 00:49:56,774
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why she was there at the marathon.

357
00:49:57,755 --> 00:50:00,616
[SPEAKER_14]: She went to the finish of the marathon every year.

358
00:50:00,756 --> 00:50:09,138
[SPEAKER_14]: She was there with her bright blue eyes, with a huge smile on her beautiful, freckled face.

359
00:50:09,858 --> 00:50:11,058
[SPEAKER_14]: She was there with her friends.

360
00:50:12,439 --> 00:50:14,719
[SPEAKER_14]: She had a gift for friendship.

361
00:50:14,799 --> 00:50:16,420
[SPEAKER_14]: She had a legion of friends.

362
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:21,301
[SPEAKER_14]: That legion of friends is here today to remember her.

363
00:50:22,173 --> 00:50:29,316
[SPEAKER_14]: They are here because she was a very loyal, very happy, very beloved friend of all who knew her.

364
00:50:29,396 --> 00:50:35,079
[SPEAKER_14]: Her spirit is the spirit of Medford, and it is the spirit of America.

365
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:38,541
[SPEAKER_14]: That is what will be remembered.

366
00:50:39,101 --> 00:50:40,581
[SPEAKER_14]: She walked these streets.

367
00:50:41,422 --> 00:50:47,685
[SPEAKER_14]: This will always be here as a way to help all of us to remember her.

368
00:50:48,931 --> 00:50:50,432
[SPEAKER_14]: She shared her humanity.

369
00:50:50,492 --> 00:50:52,113
[SPEAKER_14]: She shared her spirit.

370
00:50:53,474 --> 00:50:58,137
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is the answer to those who hate America.

371
00:51:00,058 --> 00:51:05,601
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the answer to those who want to destroy us.

372
00:51:06,662 --> 00:51:14,647
[SPEAKER_14]: Even those two weeks ago in New York, in New Jersey, who mentioned Patriots Day.

373
00:51:20,016 --> 00:51:26,658
[SPEAKER_14]: Martin Luther King said the answer to hate is not more hate, the answer to hate is love.

374
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,319
[SPEAKER_14]: The answer to hate is peace.

375
00:51:29,479 --> 00:51:35,761
[SPEAKER_14]: So even today she boosts our spirits.

376
00:51:37,895 --> 00:51:49,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Crystal, in the same way she set the finish line of the marathon to boost the spirit of her friend who was running in the marathon, is boosting our spirits once again here today.

377
00:51:50,848 --> 00:52:16,466
[SPEAKER_14]: So we come here to celebrate her spirit at this special place for each one of us, where we can come whenever we want to celebrate her life, to celebrate all of their lives, and to celebrate the fact that we live in the greatest country in the world, a country whose values of freedom and liberty and diversity

378
00:52:17,612 --> 00:52:29,865
[SPEAKER_14]: a protection of religion, a protection of every single ethnic group in our country, is what it is that makes us the greatest country in the history of the world.

379
00:52:30,365 --> 00:52:31,847
[SPEAKER_14]: And each of us can come here.

380
00:52:33,127 --> 00:52:40,889
[SPEAKER_14]: and celebrate and reflect upon that greatness every single time we leave to refresh our souls.

381
00:52:41,229 --> 00:52:44,090
[SPEAKER_14]: We thank each of the families.

382
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:49,492
[SPEAKER_14]: We thank the city of Medford for bringing together this tremendous group of people.

383
00:52:49,532 --> 00:52:51,012
[SPEAKER_14]: May God bless the families.

384
00:52:51,312 --> 00:53:01,015
[SPEAKER_14]: May God bless the United States of America.

385
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:01,695
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Senator.

386
00:53:02,682 --> 00:53:16,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Mayor Burke will now be joining members of each family for the dedication of the plaques, beginning with Venerable Gish Tenley representing the Lu family and unveiling the plaque dedicated to Lu Xilin.

387
00:53:52,758 --> 00:53:53,779
[SPEAKER_06]: We are honored to be here.

388
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:58,883
[SPEAKER_06]: And to Bill and Patricia and the entire Campbell family, I want to thank you.

389
00:54:00,024 --> 00:54:02,026
[SPEAKER_06]: This garden is inspiring.

390
00:54:02,626 --> 00:54:04,948
[SPEAKER_06]: It's transformative.

391
00:54:05,028 --> 00:54:12,034
[SPEAKER_06]: As Mayor McGlynn mentioned, and Mayor Burke mentioned, what Bill had said, it is a beautiful, beautiful place to come.

392
00:54:12,855 --> 00:54:15,437
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's being unveiled on a beautiful, beautiful day.

393
00:54:16,298 --> 00:54:20,882
[SPEAKER_06]: And crystal, you can feel crystal with every breeze that comes through here, keeping smiles and all of that.

394
00:54:22,998 --> 00:54:25,644
[SPEAKER_06]: This groundbreaking happened just under a year ago.

395
00:54:27,008 --> 00:54:32,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Now it's a vibrant, fitting memorial to four beautiful lives that we lost three and a half years ago.

396
00:54:33,781 --> 00:54:38,804
[SPEAKER_06]: You can certainly, as you're sitting here, sense the energy and compassion that went into building this memorial.

397
00:54:39,685 --> 00:54:46,309
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a result of enormous acts of kindness, donations, and grants, bringing the community together for this cause.

398
00:54:47,109 --> 00:54:49,671
[SPEAKER_06]: It's something that this city should be very proud of.

399
00:54:50,491 --> 00:54:52,633
[SPEAKER_06]: I sure know Crystal is very proud of this garden.

400
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:59,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing will ever heal the wounds of the loss felt by Crystal's family and friends.

401
00:54:59,795 --> 00:55:02,317
[SPEAKER_06]: The same goes for the other families.

402
00:55:03,158 --> 00:55:05,119
[SPEAKER_06]: But I hope this memorial brings some comfort.

403
00:55:06,020 --> 00:55:09,623
[SPEAKER_06]: That it'll always be a place of reflection, healing, and peace.

404
00:55:10,844 --> 00:55:17,590
[SPEAKER_06]: For Crystal's family, I hope it reminds them of Crystal's upbeat personality, her warm heart, and certainly her love.

405
00:55:18,688 --> 00:55:22,471
[SPEAKER_06]: Crystal, as you heard, was a beloved member of the Medford community.

406
00:55:23,232 --> 00:55:25,954
[SPEAKER_06]: But she was also a beloved member of the city of Boston community.

407
00:55:26,934 --> 00:55:28,416
[SPEAKER_06]: She attended UMass Boston.

408
00:55:29,316 --> 00:55:30,878
[SPEAKER_06]: She worked in our restaurants.

409
00:55:31,338 --> 00:55:33,199
[SPEAKER_06]: And she made our city better and brighter.

410
00:55:34,560 --> 00:55:37,463
[SPEAKER_06]: After her passing, the world learned about her spirit.

411
00:55:38,464 --> 00:55:47,591
[SPEAKER_06]: And now everyone, as everyone comes to this memorial, we're going to be reminded about the life and legacy about Crystal, Martin, Lindsay, and Sean.

412
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:52,001
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this garden is going to shine even through the winter.

413
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:55,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Every Boston Marathon, as was mentioned earlier, is going to bloom.

414
00:55:55,644 --> 00:56:01,828
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a reminder and a sign of the historic of our country, that it was founded here.

415
00:56:02,849 --> 00:56:08,072
[SPEAKER_06]: And it joins other wonderful memorials set up by the families that honor the victims.

416
00:56:08,753 --> 00:56:18,200
[SPEAKER_06]: The Children's Wharf Project in South Boston, the Martin Richard Statue and Institute in Bridgewater State, and the Granite Sculpture honoring Sean at MIT.

417
00:56:19,978 --> 00:56:30,363
[SPEAKER_06]: People are going to continue to rally around the marathon finish line to celebrate the city and our state's resilience and pay tribute to these four incredible individuals.

418
00:56:31,544 --> 00:56:41,429
[SPEAKER_06]: And now they can come here to the Crystal Campbell Peace Garden to remember their lives and to be inspired and also to come here when they're in pain themselves.

419
00:56:42,412 --> 00:56:44,714
[SPEAKER_06]: to get a sense of peace here.

420
00:56:45,936 --> 00:56:54,485
[SPEAKER_06]: They can also be surrounded by the small beautiful garden what it offers and reflects on how the beauty of goodness and how that goodness is in the world.

421
00:56:55,506 --> 00:57:02,053
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to close with one of my favorite quotes and one that I know helped many others in the difficult days after the marathon.

422
00:57:03,556 --> 00:57:04,697
[SPEAKER_06]: As Dr. King Jr.

423
00:57:04,737 --> 00:57:08,419
[SPEAKER_06]: said, darkness cannot be driven out by darkness.

424
00:57:08,999 --> 00:57:10,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Only light can do that.

425
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:12,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Hate cannot be driven out by hate.

426
00:57:13,242 --> 00:57:14,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Only love can do that.

427
00:57:15,523 --> 00:57:17,745
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what this memorial represents.

428
00:57:17,845 --> 00:57:22,267
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank you all for being here, and to all the families, thank you very much.

429
00:57:29,392 --> 00:57:29,912
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mayor.

430
00:57:31,762 --> 00:57:49,752
[SPEAKER_11]: And now, with that beautiful spark, Jane Richard joined her mom, Denise, for the unveiling of the plaque dedicated to Martin Richard with Mary Brooke.

431
00:57:49,772 --> 00:57:50,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Flower.

432
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:03,530
[SPEAKER_11]: We are so honored to have so many members of the Campbell family with us today.

433
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:06,455
[SPEAKER_11]: And Bill and Patty, would you join Mayor Burke?

434
00:58:07,277 --> 00:58:09,440
[SPEAKER_11]: Crystal's plaque with the sunflower for the anthem.

435
00:58:45,218 --> 00:59:00,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Good afternoon, Mayor Burke, Mayor McGlynn, Bill and Patty, Crystal's brother Billy, Kelly and Joe, Denise and Jane, all the dignitaries that are here today, as well as family and friends.

436
00:59:01,952 --> 00:59:08,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel honored to be here today to help commemorate this park and its message of peace and positivity.

437
00:59:09,598 --> 00:59:22,362
[SPEAKER_05]: And although I never had the honor of meeting the four young people whose lives are commemorated here, I'm sure it would be comforting for them to know they're being remembered in such a beautiful way.

438
00:59:24,262 --> 00:59:29,444
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year at the groundbreaking, speaking with Patty, she had mentioned to me that Crystal would love this park.

439
00:59:30,424 --> 00:59:38,947
[SPEAKER_05]: And more recently, in speaking to Crystal's friend Karen and Matt, they told me as well that she especially would really love this.

440
00:59:40,561 --> 00:59:46,023
[SPEAKER_05]: She would love that this place has been created in her memory and would be moved.

441
00:59:46,043 --> 00:59:56,926
[SPEAKER_05]: As we are reminded almost daily of the turmoil that exists in the world today, this garden will be a haven for those seeking refuge from the turmoil.

442
00:59:57,747 --> 01:00:02,088
[SPEAKER_05]: A place to be grounded and enjoy a few moments of peace and tranquility.

443
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:09,931
[SPEAKER_05]: The definition of peace is freedom from disturbance, quietude and tranquility.

444
01:00:11,118 --> 01:00:14,620
[SPEAKER_05]: freedom from, or the cessation of war or violence.

445
01:00:16,061 --> 01:00:32,132
[SPEAKER_05]: The definition of a peace garden is a public botanical garden created to commemorate the end of conflict or as an expression of commitment to peace, especially world peace.

446
01:00:33,753 --> 01:00:36,495
[SPEAKER_05]: This memorial garden is true of that definition.

447
01:00:37,453 --> 01:00:51,524
[SPEAKER_05]: It is an expression of the commitment that Campbell family and the city of Medford and those residents of Medford have to create a space that honors four people that sought peace in a turbulent world.

448
01:00:52,744 --> 01:01:02,712
[SPEAKER_05]: This garden is a reminder of how the hatred that stole four precious lives can be overcome by love in a united community.

449
01:01:04,244 --> 01:01:13,251
[SPEAKER_05]: In this beautiful, peaceful sanctuary, we can reflect on the goodness, passion, and innocence personified in these symbols.

450
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:24,239
[SPEAKER_05]: As mentioned several times today, the symbols, the baseball glove for Martin, the book for Lindsay, the police badge for Sean, and the sunflower for Crystal.

451
01:01:25,588 --> 01:01:34,375
[SPEAKER_05]: The center of the fountain was created making it rise above as it represents the survivors and future peace.

452
01:01:35,997 --> 01:01:41,321
[SPEAKER_05]: This park is a beacon of their life which will serve to remind us of what true character should be.

453
01:01:42,542 --> 01:01:51,450
[SPEAKER_05]: When we see the symbols represented here, one can't help but think of how communities can unite despite chaos and tragedy.

454
01:01:52,686 --> 01:01:59,270
[SPEAKER_05]: That there is hope and determination that we as a community can and have risen above.

455
01:01:59,910 --> 01:02:11,657
[SPEAKER_05]: And although we are reminded of the innocence lost, we are also reminded of the wisdom gained and the messages that Martin, Crystal, Lingzi, and Shawn left for us.

456
01:02:13,738 --> 01:02:23,821
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very fitting that we can see symbols of their youth, beauty, life, vitality, learning, and selfless service everywhere we look within this garden.

457
01:02:24,801 --> 01:02:35,304
[SPEAKER_05]: We can take great comfort knowing these symbols have not only been woven into every aspect of this garden, but will remain etched in all the hearts of those who visit.

458
01:02:36,668 --> 01:02:46,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Although pain and despair have touched us all, it is critical that we take and emulate the character we see represented here in our lives every day.

459
01:02:47,212 --> 01:02:49,192
[SPEAKER_05]: May God bless you all and keep you safe.

460
01:02:49,753 --> 01:02:59,716
Thank you.

461
01:03:04,258 --> 01:03:04,978
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Roseanne.

462
01:03:07,111 --> 01:03:24,442
[SPEAKER_11]: It's my pleasure now to bring Bill Campbell to the podium.

463
01:03:24,462 --> 01:03:26,343
[SPEAKER_07]: Good afternoon.

464
01:03:26,723 --> 01:03:28,184
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to say one thing.

465
01:03:28,444 --> 01:03:34,288
[SPEAKER_07]: Mike McGlynn did have a vision, and that vision is here today.

466
01:03:35,538 --> 01:03:43,020
[SPEAKER_07]: And my wife, my family, I just want to thank you, our community, where we live.

467
01:03:43,961 --> 01:03:44,961
[SPEAKER_07]: We love each and everyone.

468
01:03:45,641 --> 01:03:46,261
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much.

469
01:03:52,944 --> 01:04:00,226
[SPEAKER_00]: God of peace and healing, on this day of memory, let us find renewed hope in this Crystal Campbell Peace Garden.

470
01:04:01,626 --> 01:04:03,487
[SPEAKER_00]: May its sunflowers, waters,

471
01:04:04,655 --> 01:04:12,481
[SPEAKER_00]: and memorial plaques serve as a loving tribute to the lives of Crystal Campbell, Martin Richard, Lingzi Liu, and Sean Collier.

472
01:04:12,661 --> 01:04:14,242
[SPEAKER_00]: May their memories be for a blessing.

473
01:04:15,543 --> 01:04:20,446
[SPEAKER_00]: May we recall the selfless deeds of the first responders who extended their arms in love and comfort.

474
01:04:21,607 --> 01:04:29,533
[SPEAKER_00]: May the scarlet of peace stand as a testament to our faith that love rules over hate, peace over violence, and hope over despair.

475
01:04:31,213 --> 01:04:39,522
[SPEAKER_00]: May this garden of peace inspire renewed dialogue and understanding, as when we speak to each other, we can create a world of harmony and peace.

476
01:04:41,444 --> 01:04:48,612
[SPEAKER_00]: May this Bristol Campbell Peace Garden inspire us to fulfill among us, in a small way, what is written in scripture.

477
01:04:49,768 --> 01:04:54,770
[SPEAKER_00]: I shall give peace upon the earth, and you shall lie down in none to make you afraid.

478
01:04:55,590 --> 01:04:57,730
[SPEAKER_00]: I shall abolish from the earth the predatory beast.

479
01:04:58,411 --> 01:05:00,511
[SPEAKER_00]: The sword shall never come upon your land.

480
01:05:01,051 --> 01:05:04,833
[SPEAKER_00]: Justice shall roll down like water, and righteousness like a mighty stream.

481
01:05:06,053 --> 01:05:10,034
[SPEAKER_00]: And like all Jewish prayers, I will end with a prayer for shalom, for peace.

482
01:05:11,355 --> 01:05:18,497
[SPEAKER_00]: May the one who makes peace in the heavens bring peace to all of us and to all of humanity, and let us say amen.
