00:20:31,754 --> 00:20:32,875

00:20:43,035 --> 00:20:44,816

00:20:48,279 --> 00:20:48,819
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

96
00:20:48,959 --> 00:20:49,319
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry.

97
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:50,700
[SPEAKER_14]: I was going to grab the document.

98
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,701
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to screen share.

99
00:21:21,123 --> 00:21:34,267
[SPEAKER_14]: The presentation this evening is going just to be providing the committee with an update on the goals that were approved at the January 8th, 2024 meeting.

100
00:21:35,107 --> 00:21:38,148
[SPEAKER_14]: And so the district improvement goal

101
00:21:38,908 --> 00:21:51,136
[SPEAKER_14]: for this school year is that the Medford Public Schools will improve systems and structures that directly impact student services, student and family and communications and school facilities and operations.

102
00:21:51,897 --> 00:22:01,403
[SPEAKER_14]: And so there were 11 key actions that the committee requested to see movement on.

103
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:08,488
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I want to report out on the district goal, the student learning goal and the professional practice goal.

104
00:22:09,588 --> 00:22:19,192
[SPEAKER_14]: So under key action number one, improve accessibility to facilities and develop a ticketing system.

105
00:22:20,353 --> 00:22:24,575
[SPEAKER_14]: We have completed that first task.

106
00:22:25,715 --> 00:22:34,139
[SPEAKER_14]: We have partnered with operations hero, which will be the system that will

107
00:22:36,937 --> 00:22:49,567
[SPEAKER_14]: operations hero is a system that we will be using to manage our programs and ticketing systems that are being entered into the ticketing system for the district to address.

108
00:22:50,528 --> 00:22:51,709
[SPEAKER_14]: That was one of the first

109
00:22:53,888 --> 00:22:57,529
[SPEAKER_14]: pieces that we were able to secure this year.

110
00:22:57,669 --> 00:23:04,771
[SPEAKER_14]: And so operations hero is the portal that will be used for our school facilities.

111
00:23:05,731 --> 00:23:19,054
[SPEAKER_14]: And the team consisted of Dr. Cushing and principals and a few others who helped to say what the ticketing system could look like for the Medford public schools.

112
00:23:20,424 --> 00:23:25,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Key action number two was regarding consistent communications to families.

113
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:35,478
[SPEAKER_14]: And three was effective, appropriate, and consistent messaging when there were also emergency scenarios.

114
00:23:36,099 --> 00:23:44,446
[SPEAKER_14]: And so from a communications perspective, we are actively using some more.

115
00:23:45,647 --> 00:23:55,459
[SPEAKER_14]: We are actually using final site, which is our website mass notifications and We are using talking points which are

116
00:23:56,983 --> 00:23:59,184
[SPEAKER_14]: has been getting tremendous traction.

117
00:24:00,025 --> 00:24:12,170
[SPEAKER_14]: And it seems like my computer's going a little slowly, but I'll try to explain what the links are that I've hyperlinked within the document for your review.

118
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:18,474
[SPEAKER_14]: But for Talking Points, this school year, we sent over 803,705 messages were sent out to families.

119
00:24:26,573 --> 00:24:30,297
[SPEAKER_14]: And so this talking points is able to translate.

120
00:24:30,777 --> 00:24:50,016
[SPEAKER_14]: It shows all the languages, English, Portuguese, Spanish, Haitian Creole, simplified Chinese, Arabic, Bengali, Vietnamese, Nepali, Punjabi, Albanian, and there are many other languages, but also we use it for English, and as you can see,

121
00:24:50,717 --> 00:24:58,341
[SPEAKER_14]: this turquoise blue, it goes out to the whole community and it's really being used effectively.

122
00:24:58,902 --> 00:25:12,449
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, here, EL students is represented by the turquoise bar, non-EL, and then unknown, but again, it is being used effectively.

123
00:25:13,777 --> 00:25:27,161
[SPEAKER_14]: a tool that we are using as a district, oh, a tool that we are using as a district, and it is yielding really great communication, quick communication with families.

124
00:25:32,142 --> 00:25:32,722
[SPEAKER_10]: One moment.

125
00:25:35,363 --> 00:25:35,823
[SPEAKER_10]: Go back.

126
00:25:38,184 --> 00:25:38,964
[SPEAKER_10]: Apologize.

127
00:25:48,482 --> 00:25:55,167
[SPEAKER_14]: I apologize, my... Here we go.

128
00:26:03,252 --> 00:26:03,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

129
00:26:04,894 --> 00:26:11,979
[SPEAKER_14]: In terms of a different outcome, which I didn't address, was to finalize the employee handbook.

130
00:26:13,294 --> 00:26:18,395
[SPEAKER_14]: Hyperlinked within this document is an employee handbook that shall be completed.

131
00:26:19,016 --> 00:26:23,857
[SPEAKER_14]: It is about 97% completed for the Medford Public Schools.

132
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:36,441
[SPEAKER_14]: There are a few areas that we are just receiving additional consult on, and I am continuing to work with Enough Abuse.

133
00:26:37,141 --> 00:26:40,762
[SPEAKER_14]: They have a portion, a separate,

134
00:26:41,622 --> 00:26:46,468
[SPEAKER_14]: employee handbook or an agreement about rules of engagement with students.

135
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:50,012
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I am also receiving consult from them.

136
00:26:50,492 --> 00:26:58,582
[SPEAKER_14]: So our hope is to have this employee handbook fully finalized by the summer to be able to launch and start the new school year.

137
00:27:00,538 --> 00:27:10,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Another area that we have addressed in terms of district improvement goals is accessibility of parking outside in front of Medford Public Schools.

138
00:27:11,684 --> 00:27:20,549
[SPEAKER_14]: The loop at the high school here had limited ADA accessible parking on the loop.

139
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:28,313
[SPEAKER_14]: And so what we did was we took the side closest to the building and we added

140
00:27:29,756 --> 00:27:34,618
[SPEAKER_14]: accessible parking in front of the entire high school loop.

141
00:27:35,318 --> 00:27:39,159
[SPEAKER_14]: And on the opposite side of the loop is now visitor parking.

142
00:27:39,719 --> 00:27:49,822
[SPEAKER_14]: So family members of the community, parents that are coming on campus, they can come to Medford High School, find parking on the loop,

143
00:27:50,382 --> 00:27:54,805
[SPEAKER_14]: come in for meetings, come in to register, and come in and out.

144
00:27:54,985 --> 00:28:10,696
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that was something that we did to make the high school a more welcoming environment, and especially where we are working on making the high school campus more ADA accessible by having

145
00:28:12,341 --> 00:28:17,104
[SPEAKER_14]: multiple ADA parking spots at the front of the building.

146
00:28:17,344 --> 00:28:24,870
[SPEAKER_14]: It is definitely more accessible for members of our community that need greater and closer access to the building.

147
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:32,695
[SPEAKER_14]: And we also have one reserved spot for our military veterans on the visitor side.

148
00:28:34,372 --> 00:28:49,624
[SPEAKER_14]: In addition to that, a charge was to reestablish the capital planning committee and begin looking at building systems to create a replacement timeline for individual systems that may not be working properly.

149
00:28:53,507 --> 00:29:01,577
[SPEAKER_14]: strategic and capital planning subcommittee did meet March 26th and there was a May 21st meeting.

150
00:29:02,318 --> 00:29:05,903
[SPEAKER_14]: The agenda and minutes are hyperlinked and attached there.

151
00:29:05,923 --> 00:29:08,366
[SPEAKER_14]: In addition to that,

152
00:29:09,187 --> 00:29:15,814
[SPEAKER_14]: Bullet number five, seizing every opportunity to collaborate with the Massachusetts School Building Authority.

153
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:23,742
[SPEAKER_14]: We have an active school building MSBA group, and there is even a separate website

154
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:27,506
[SPEAKER_14]: which is buildingmhs.org.

155
00:29:28,106 --> 00:29:37,648
[SPEAKER_14]: And so you can access it through the district's Medford Public Schools website, or you can go directly to buildingmhs.org.

156
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:51,211
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was work that was done this year to, again, secure the website for the work that's taking place with MSBA and the Medford High School Building Committee.

157
00:29:51,311 --> 00:29:53,712
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was bullet number five.

158
00:29:54,659 --> 00:30:03,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Number six, about enhancing human resource practices, job posting, hiring, payroll management, and labor relations.

159
00:30:04,605 --> 00:30:12,191
[SPEAKER_14]: We have put different systems and structures in place, working closely with the finance office.

160
00:30:12,291 --> 00:30:25,220
[SPEAKER_14]: We've added codes so that it's more easily identifiable for the district to be able to say where the funding sources are coming from, and that work is continuing to be done.

161
00:30:26,442 --> 00:30:30,227
[SPEAKER_14]: This year, there was a request for a timely budget process.

162
00:30:30,748 --> 00:30:32,911
[SPEAKER_14]: That budget process did take place.

163
00:30:33,592 --> 00:30:39,741
[SPEAKER_14]: I hyperlinked in one of the slide decks from a timely budget process that took place.

164
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:45,080
[SPEAKER_14]: We also had an excessive heat protocol.

165
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,961
[SPEAKER_14]: That was an ask, that task was completed this year.

166
00:30:49,981 --> 00:31:08,944
[SPEAKER_14]: And at an earlier meeting, that meeting was, I believe it looks like it was the 11th of May, where the school committee approved the excessive heat protocol for what we need to do when we have extreme temperatures.

167
00:31:10,529 --> 00:31:14,532
[SPEAKER_14]: Revised middle school and high school schedules, we worked with a partner.

168
00:31:15,413 --> 00:31:23,660
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, here, hyperlinkedin is the presentation of the Medford High School scheduling opportunity review.

169
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:32,246
[SPEAKER_14]: And this abbreviated slide deck explains the potential models that will provide

170
00:31:33,747 --> 00:31:54,852
[SPEAKER_14]: greater scheduling, and here at the high school where we have the six-day schedule and the five-day schedule, what a potential schedule could look like with the five-day and the six-day merging and becoming a five-day schedule, a seven-period day is one of the proposed model that was recommended.

171
00:31:55,962 --> 00:31:57,243
[SPEAKER_14]: by our outside partner.

172
00:31:57,904 --> 00:32:05,709
[SPEAKER_14]: And there were several staff that also had worked on potential schedules, and the schedules were very similar.

173
00:32:07,451 --> 00:32:13,735
[SPEAKER_14]: Bullet number 10 was implementing the new bullying policy, full implementation.

174
00:32:14,836 --> 00:32:21,201
[SPEAKER_14]: In addition to having updated bullying form, which is hyperlinked in here, we also have

175
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:30,376
[SPEAKER_14]: bullying report slides, presentations that have taken place for administrators.

176
00:32:31,457 --> 00:32:31,658
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

177
00:32:31,678 --> 00:32:39,106
[SPEAKER_14]: Bowen, our director of student services oversees that and reports all information to DESE.

178
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:54,483
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, the 11th request was the outcome of the high school climate study, and within that, I hyperlinked in, um, the presentation from, uh, Principal Cabral, Ms.

179
00:32:54,523 --> 00:33:08,266
[SPEAKER_14]: Cabral at the high school, providing an update on where the high school is with, um, uh, the high school climate, and it has improved markedly, and we're really, really, um,

180
00:33:09,665 --> 00:33:11,786
[SPEAKER_14]: really, really pleased about the progress.

181
00:33:12,406 --> 00:33:28,974
[SPEAKER_14]: In terms of the student learning goal, we have included what our students are doing here under key actions, things that are supporting the development and the implementation of the new curriculum into reading.

182
00:33:29,454 --> 00:33:37,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Here is the elementary update that Dr. Galussi shared, which gives a lot of information

183
00:33:38,658 --> 00:33:55,915
[SPEAKER_14]: that is related to inter-reading data, and this goes out to all elementary staff and the elementary level to let the community know as well where are students, how are they performing with their work and data.

184
00:33:58,951 --> 00:34:05,476
[SPEAKER_14]: some of the outcomes that were asked to look at NWEA math growth data.

185
00:34:06,096 --> 00:34:11,620
[SPEAKER_14]: The end of year testing window closed on June 10th, June 12th of this year.

186
00:34:12,321 --> 00:34:17,985
[SPEAKER_14]: And so there is preliminary data for DIBELS and professional development.

187
00:34:18,465 --> 00:34:23,408
[SPEAKER_14]: And at the start of next school year, Dr. Galluzzi will present

188
00:34:25,336 --> 00:34:40,747
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, the most current updated information on how it ended, but we wanted to provide you with some data as this was an ask on how are we making progress with our student learning goals.

189
00:34:42,188 --> 00:34:56,636
[SPEAKER_14]: Under professional practice goal, I am still working collaboratively with MASS, Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, and DESE, Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

190
00:34:56,656 --> 00:35:00,158
[SPEAKER_14]: I am part of the BIPOC Superintendent Network.

191
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,139
[SPEAKER_14]: And in addition to that,

192
00:35:04,481 --> 00:35:07,142
[SPEAKER_14]: The BIPOC network is for superintendents of color.

193
00:35:07,903 --> 00:35:13,185
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm part of leading now, which is a national superintendents group.

194
00:35:13,925 --> 00:35:18,667
[SPEAKER_14]: And I will be attending the leading now convening this July.

195
00:35:19,968 --> 00:35:27,371
[SPEAKER_14]: In July, we will be meeting in Columbus, Ohio, for a retreat of superintendents across the country.

196
00:35:28,203 --> 00:35:42,292
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've linked some pertinent information from DESE and MASS on what the sessions entail.

197
00:35:43,032 --> 00:35:53,999
[SPEAKER_14]: I've hyperlinked some slide decks in here and what is happening with leading now and how they work with superintendents.

198
00:35:55,802 --> 00:35:59,172
[SPEAKER_14]: to support school districts in the

199
00:36:01,354 --> 00:36:02,275
[SPEAKER_14]: in today's era.

200
00:36:02,955 --> 00:36:13,142
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, we do look at race, equity, diversity, and inclusion, which is just another way of saying DEI, but that's what REDI stands for, R-E-D-I.

201
00:36:13,722 --> 00:36:20,807
[SPEAKER_14]: And then I continue to collaborate with our district attorney's office.

202
00:36:21,688 --> 00:36:30,974
[SPEAKER_14]: And I included here in January, DA Ryan invited all superintendents and chiefs of police

203
00:36:31,714 --> 00:36:51,203
[SPEAKER_14]: and chiefs of fire to a convening and we met in Lexington where they had a wonderful presentation to talk to superintendents, chiefs of police, and chiefs of fire just about our roles and the work that we're doing supporting our communities.

204
00:36:52,153 --> 00:37:02,100
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just wanted to present that data to you, the committee, and I know that you will take it and work with it.

205
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:18,832
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, I'll be open to emails or any other, respond to any questions that I can respond to right now, but I can also respond to specific questions if you choose to send them to me electronically.

206
00:37:20,853 --> 00:37:21,874
[SPEAKER_14]: That is my presentation.

207
00:37:22,486 --> 00:37:23,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Dr. Edward Vincent.

208
00:37:26,029 --> 00:37:28,732
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's no questions, are there any questions from the committee?

209
00:37:36,018 --> 00:37:36,318
[SPEAKER_07]: Mayor?

210
00:37:36,779 --> 00:37:38,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham.

211
00:37:38,701 --> 00:37:46,608
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to talk about what we have done in the past from a process perspective, since we have so many new members.

212
00:37:48,277 --> 00:37:50,798
[SPEAKER_07]: just to sort of get the ball rolling.

213
00:37:50,958 --> 00:38:02,464
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is the superintendent self-evaluation, and then we as a committee have to compile our evaluation and then present it back in an open session just like this.

214
00:38:03,665 --> 00:38:12,730
[SPEAKER_07]: But what we did last year that seemed to work was that the evaluation subcommittee met, had a meeting, established a timeline,

215
00:38:13,650 --> 00:38:31,112
[SPEAKER_07]: of all the steps that had to happen from our perspective, and then held a separate, a second meeting where they compiled the results from all the different pieces of evaluation from each of us individually, and then that came to the floor to be

216
00:38:32,674 --> 00:38:37,897
[SPEAKER_07]: to be reviewed here and presented and ultimately approved.

217
00:38:38,477 --> 00:38:42,019
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think those are the next steps is for that committee.

218
00:38:42,039 --> 00:38:44,380
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think member Olapade chairs that committee.

219
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:50,984
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think the next steps would be for you all to find a time to meet and establish the right timeline.

220
00:38:51,084 --> 00:38:54,165
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can dig up and obviously support you.

221
00:38:55,646 --> 00:38:58,888
[SPEAKER_07]: with the process because I think everyone on the committee is new.

222
00:38:58,908 --> 00:39:07,513
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can definitely give you some process like guidance along the way in terms of what needs to happen.

223
00:39:09,414 --> 00:39:16,458
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think the most important thing for all the members to know is that everything that we do here as part of

224
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:24,875
[SPEAKER_07]: compiling the superintendent's evaluation is a matter of public record and must be done on the floor.

225
00:39:24,935 --> 00:39:27,438
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not stuff that happens in executive session, which.

226
00:39:28,846 --> 00:39:29,487
[SPEAKER_07]: is the law.

227
00:39:29,947 --> 00:39:31,849
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not, would not be my preference.

228
00:39:31,929 --> 00:39:39,375
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sure it would not be the superintendent's preference, but there are unfortunately like there, that is the process that we have to go through.

229
00:39:39,455 --> 00:39:44,700
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of your subcommittee meetings will be held as hosted subcommittee meetings.

230
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Members of the public are free to attend.

231
00:39:48,243 --> 00:39:53,147
[SPEAKER_07]: And the sort of mechanics of how you compile all have to be done in

232
00:39:53,867 --> 00:40:06,474
[SPEAKER_07]: in open session, so I just wanted to put that out there because there are some next steps there, and I just wanted to make sure that if there are questions about that, we give folks an opportunity to ask some questions.

233
00:40:10,817 --> 00:40:12,818
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for the outline, Member Graham.

234
00:40:14,779 --> 00:40:21,323
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna, if there's no further questions, we'll get that meeting scheduled and keep us posted on that.

235
00:40:21,363 --> 00:40:23,144
[SPEAKER_11]: We're gonna go to recommendation to approve

236
00:40:24,565 --> 00:40:27,926
[SPEAKER_11]: potential partnership with City Year, Dr. Edward Vincent?

237
00:40:28,907 --> 00:40:29,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

238
00:40:31,788 --> 00:40:49,375
[SPEAKER_14]: So one of the potential partnerships, Medford Public Schools, we were approached by a former colleague that I worked with who is now leading City Year Boston.

239
00:40:50,416 --> 00:40:50,576
[SPEAKER_14]: And

240
00:40:53,871 --> 00:41:03,076
[SPEAKER_14]: This partnership would potentially bring two teams of AmeriCorps members to Medford, with each team being composed of five to six members.

241
00:41:03,956 --> 00:41:14,302
[SPEAKER_14]: City Year AmeriCorps members are trained to provide high-quality support to students, teachers, and the entire school community to accelerate student learning and performance.

242
00:41:15,362 --> 00:41:20,667
[SPEAKER_14]: AmeriCorps members work closely with principals and teachers to deliver critical services.

243
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:33,540
[SPEAKER_14]: These services, part of their whole school, whole child model, are delivered in schools by highly trained, diverse teams of young adult AmeriCorps members who serve full-time for one academic year.

244
00:41:35,638 --> 00:41:54,135
[SPEAKER_14]: A few of the activities that they provide are one-on-one and small group instruction, supporting extended day programming before and after school, supporting small group social emotional skill building, supporting whole school activities for students, families, and the community.

245
00:41:55,016 --> 00:41:59,680
[SPEAKER_14]: They serve as success coaches and mentor student leaders.

246
00:42:01,699 --> 00:42:10,021
[SPEAKER_14]: And the near peer age and diversity of the AmeriCorps members, they are young adults between the ages of 18 and 25.

247
00:42:10,602 --> 00:42:18,424
[SPEAKER_14]: Many of them, it's a gap year between finishing college and going out into the workforce.

248
00:42:18,644 --> 00:42:22,745
[SPEAKER_14]: It gives them an opportunity to connect and relate to students that they serve.

249
00:42:23,465 --> 00:42:27,886
[SPEAKER_14]: And as a result of being part of AmeriCorps, they are also

250
00:42:29,947 --> 00:42:39,290
[SPEAKER_14]: They also receive benefits in turn from loans and things like that for volunteering their time.

251
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:40,790
[SPEAKER_14]: They are compensated.

252
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:43,591
[SPEAKER_14]: I shouldn't say it's volunteer.

253
00:42:43,631 --> 00:42:57,415
[SPEAKER_14]: They're compensated at a small rate, but they do receive loan support or access to special grants for members that do support AmeriCorps.

254
00:42:59,355 --> 00:43:14,922
[SPEAKER_14]: This opportunity, when it was presented, and we were approached, I immediately thought of two of our schools which serve some of our most vulnerable populations.

255
00:43:16,062 --> 00:43:20,865
[SPEAKER_14]: and that would be the Missittuck school and the McGlynn school.

256
00:43:22,405 --> 00:43:34,772
[SPEAKER_14]: It is not a free program, there would be a cost to the district and we are in the process right now of working on a

257
00:43:37,675 --> 00:43:45,740
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, we are in the process right now of, um, it is considered a sole source, but we are working with City Hall.

258
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:59,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, Mr. McHugh has, um, sent it forward to look for procurement, to look at the cost and look at the, um, contract that, um, was proposed for the Medford Public Schools.

259
00:43:59,988 --> 00:44:03,831
[SPEAKER_14]: So my recommendation is, um, the cost of the City Year team

260
00:44:04,571 --> 00:44:07,974
[SPEAKER_14]: for Medford would be approximately $100,000.

261
00:44:09,975 --> 00:44:13,918
[SPEAKER_14]: The normal cost is $120,000 per team.

262
00:44:15,139 --> 00:44:26,488
[SPEAKER_14]: And through negotiating and working collaboratively with them, they are willing to work with Medford this year.

263
00:44:28,189 --> 00:44:38,397
[SPEAKER_14]: for the discounted rate of $100,000 for a team of five to six individuals who would be supporting our schools.

264
00:44:38,597 --> 00:44:47,464
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we are able to have the two teams, that would be my desire for us to work with two teams and pilot those two teams.

265
00:44:48,025 --> 00:44:56,832
[SPEAKER_14]: And if for whatever reason we could not secure two teams, then I would ask the committee for permission to secure one team

266
00:44:58,233 --> 00:45:00,716
[SPEAKER_14]: to come to the school and support our school.

267
00:45:04,161 --> 00:45:05,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

268
00:45:05,763 --> 00:45:07,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Rousseau, then Member Olapade.

269
00:45:08,707 --> 00:45:10,750
[SPEAKER_17]: If you don't mind, I'd let Member Olapade go first.

270
00:45:11,571 --> 00:45:12,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Olapade.

271
00:45:13,288 --> 00:45:14,229
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very so.

272
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:19,434
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have some opinions on this as a former member of City Year Boston.

273
00:45:19,835 --> 00:45:22,437
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to see that the possible partnership does exist.

274
00:45:22,537 --> 00:45:28,503
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the mission and the goals of City Year as an entity, as an AmeriCorps program is phenomenal.

275
00:45:28,904 --> 00:45:31,166
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a great time doing it when I graduated from high school.

276
00:45:31,746 --> 00:45:35,230
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working in an eighth grade mathematics course in Charlestown.

277
00:45:35,911 --> 00:45:44,414
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I got to work hand-in-hand with educators, the administrative staff of Edwards Middle School, and then City or Boston themselves.

278
00:45:46,314 --> 00:45:48,655
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of things for people to know on the committee.

279
00:45:49,175 --> 00:45:57,997
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the really interesting things about how City Year operates is that we receive quite a bit of formal training preceding our time in the schools.

280
00:45:58,177 --> 00:46:01,098
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we're in our program, we're still receiving that training.

281
00:46:01,899 --> 00:46:03,279
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of one-on-one

282
00:46:04,283 --> 00:46:05,484
[SPEAKER_00]: coursework that we go through.

283
00:46:06,444 --> 00:46:10,065
[SPEAKER_00]: We did about six weeks of training preceding the start of the school year.

284
00:46:10,565 --> 00:46:14,486
[SPEAKER_00]: Full-time every single day going to work sites, working with your team.

285
00:46:15,226 --> 00:46:28,751
[SPEAKER_00]: You then are landed in a work site around the greater Boston area and you'll work with your team for the full year depending on your preferences or your ability and your age will determine how you are posted to your workspace.

286
00:46:28,791 --> 00:46:28,911
[SPEAKER_00]: So

287
00:46:30,856 --> 00:46:33,857
[SPEAKER_00]: Only college graduates are allowed to work with high school age students.

288
00:46:34,377 --> 00:46:37,739
[SPEAKER_00]: City as an entity usually is from the 3rd grade to the 10th grade.

289
00:46:38,119 --> 00:46:53,845
[SPEAKER_00]: We understand through research and a lot of studies that 3rd grade, 8th grade, and 10th grade are the focal points of maturization, and that's where a lot of students find themselves needing to determine if they can continue on with the current coursework that is being given to them by the state or by their school.

290
00:46:54,845 --> 00:47:02,870
[SPEAKER_00]: By the third grade, that's when research has determined that if a student is falling behind, hitting certain academic thresholds, they'll never recover.

291
00:47:03,170 --> 00:47:21,319
[SPEAKER_00]: If they can't continue to find those thresholds, more often than not, it's going to be harder and harder for them to find the missing material and retention that they need to stack up against their peers, which is why City Year has continued to be an entity that's, I think, in over 30 states, probably, and three different continents at this point.

292
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,381
[SPEAKER_00]: I found a great love for doing the work.

293
00:47:24,422 --> 00:47:37,672
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what got me excited about education in general, was that work right after high school, working as an 18, 19-year-old, working in a classroom with a partner teacher, getting to work with a subsection of the class each day.

294
00:47:37,692 --> 00:47:39,213
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in class all day.

295
00:47:39,233 --> 00:47:40,975
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a lot of really good work.

296
00:47:41,435 --> 00:47:51,443
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that as we continue to have a conversation about a partnership, I want to make sure that we're conscious about how they're not treated and we shouldn't treat them as full-time teachers.

297
00:47:51,963 --> 00:47:54,466
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have the education or the certifications to be that.

298
00:47:54,846 --> 00:48:08,179
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not suggesting that that's what's happening here, but it's important that we as a district understand that they are support staff who have done really good work and are there to support our educators and our teachers as much as possible and the community that they'll be working in.

299
00:48:08,860 --> 00:48:12,584
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are not, I don't think that we should treat them as being full-time staff.

300
00:48:13,324 --> 00:48:15,204
[SPEAKER_00]: because they don't have the qualifications to do that.

301
00:48:15,644 --> 00:48:31,767
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as we continue to figure out how we're going to implement a team in one or more schools, I think it's important that we are communicating just religiously with that school about how they'll fit into a classroom day in day, every day.

302
00:48:31,988 --> 00:48:35,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Because with my school and how my program worked, I was working with the same teacher every day.

303
00:48:36,348 --> 00:48:39,589
[SPEAKER_00]: Some schools need to have different needs, so you might be switching from one teacher to another.

304
00:48:40,089 --> 00:48:43,251
[SPEAKER_00]: But my school, the primary focus was one teacher each day.

305
00:48:43,271 --> 00:48:46,393
[SPEAKER_00]: Math and English are the two primary focuses of City Year.

306
00:48:46,654 --> 00:48:50,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that may have changed in the last five years since I did it, but math and English were the two focus subjects.

307
00:48:51,677 --> 00:48:53,478
[SPEAKER_00]: Social emotional learning was a really big thing.

308
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:55,860
[SPEAKER_00]: Teen mentoring was another big part of it.

309
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:58,662
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside community programming was another big part of City Year.

310
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:03,946
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's so many benefits this organization has to offer any community, any district.

311
00:49:04,726 --> 00:49:06,267
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important that we understand that

312
00:49:07,128 --> 00:49:16,237
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a mission and a plan as an entity, as an organization, and they, I think, do a good job of trying to fit into what each district is asking of them.

313
00:49:17,598 --> 00:49:28,369
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a matter of how do we, I think, utilize their skill set and what they're offering us to the best of that cost to us of that $100,000 at the reduced rate that the superintendent mentioned.

314
00:49:29,486 --> 00:49:33,588
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are just some of the first thoughts that I had about this and I'm excited about the potential of it.

315
00:49:33,648 --> 00:49:49,317
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to make sure we're really careful about how we're implementing them and what that actually looks like for the students especially, but the teachers themselves and that we're not leaning on them too much because that's going to potentially burden the staff in general in a way that we don't want.

316
00:49:49,477 --> 00:49:53,640
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to put us in a position where we're not conscious about the lack of

317
00:49:54,520 --> 00:50:02,030
[SPEAKER_00]: certified, you know, educated, educate teachers, when we have a support staff who are there to support us the best of our ability.

318
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:05,073
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for letting me rant for a moment.

319
00:50:05,934 --> 00:50:06,215
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

320
00:50:07,748 --> 00:50:14,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I just want to say the senior vice president, Monica Roberts, she is on the call as well.

321
00:50:14,673 --> 00:50:20,778
[SPEAKER_14]: And I had asked Dr. Cushing to, I think, allow her to speak.

322
00:50:20,838 --> 00:50:28,284
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure if she was able to speak, but I wanted her to also be able to talk about City Year.

323
00:50:28,824 --> 00:50:32,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Erin, member Olapade, I appreciate your sharing.

324
00:50:32,587 --> 00:50:34,409
[SPEAKER_14]: And what I did not say to the committee is,

325
00:50:35,149 --> 00:50:44,371
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, when City Year came out in the nineties, I was one of the fortunate teachers to have been blessed with City Year member core members in my classroom.

326
00:50:45,132 --> 00:50:54,394
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was, um, they were such a wonderful addition to the school, the culture, the climate.

327
00:50:55,154 --> 00:50:58,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, they were, uh, a force of positive presence.

328
00:50:59,495 --> 00:51:09,838
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, helping with before school programming, after school programming, supporting instruction, and really building great relationships with the students.

329
00:51:10,418 --> 00:51:17,340
[SPEAKER_14]: So I personally experienced it, and it was a very, very positive experience.

330
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:23,842
[SPEAKER_14]: And they were highly sought after, and there weren't enough teams to go into

331
00:51:25,572 --> 00:51:25,992
[SPEAKER_14]: to be able to support.

332
00:51:26,353 --> 00:51:27,794
[SPEAKER_14]: All of all of the schools.

333
00:51:28,254 --> 00:51:33,299
[SPEAKER_14]: So I see member Ruseau has his hand and then maybe after member Ruseau, Monica Robert.

334
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:34,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

335
00:51:34,821 --> 00:51:35,321
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Doctor.

336
00:51:35,341 --> 00:51:36,642
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember yourself.

337
00:51:37,543 --> 00:51:38,284
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

338
00:51:39,064 --> 00:51:39,225
[SPEAKER_17]: Um.

339
00:51:40,386 --> 00:51:42,848
[SPEAKER_17]: So I don't really know much about city year other than

340
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:53,051
[SPEAKER_17]: recipient of services or however you would describe that, I think that's awesome.

341
00:51:54,372 --> 00:52:05,201
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm curious, I did read the entire memo and I'm wondering what the stipend is for 45 hours of labor per week.

342
00:52:05,682 --> 00:52:07,723
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll ask my questions and then I can go back.

343
00:52:08,806 --> 00:52:09,827
[SPEAKER_17]: Somebody has answers.

344
00:52:10,848 --> 00:52:12,369
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll just get them all out once.

345
00:52:13,690 --> 00:52:19,556
[SPEAKER_17]: How do we ensure that they're not doing any work that is currently covered by any of our CBAs with our union partners?

346
00:52:21,197 --> 00:52:26,882
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't take union work and give it to non-union members, and I'm concerned about that.

347
00:52:31,374 --> 00:52:49,112
[SPEAKER_17]: wonder what of the $100,000 is used, what percentage of that is used to pay the employees, which I don't, I don't know if they're considered employees since the word stipend is a very specific legal thing used, which I typically dislike that word stipend when people are gonna be working full time.

348
00:52:50,933 --> 00:52:51,474
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I'm,

349
00:52:55,649 --> 00:53:06,138
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I've read a couple of articles, it seems to suggest that City Year folks spend a significant amount of time talking about City Year while they're in the schools, drumming up support for future City Year participants.

350
00:53:06,638 --> 00:53:09,420
[SPEAKER_17]: And I guess I would ask Member Olapade, how did you hear about City Year?

351
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:13,524
[SPEAKER_17]: If I could ask through the chair.

352
00:53:15,485 --> 00:53:16,026
[SPEAKER_10]: Member Olapade?

353
00:53:17,387 --> 00:53:19,528
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I heard it through a family friend of ours.

354
00:53:20,108 --> 00:53:27,671
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was looking at college opportunities, we had the opportunity to attend a City Year sponsored event.

355
00:53:28,431 --> 00:53:35,794
[SPEAKER_00]: The former executive director, Sandra Lopez-Burke, I believe her name was, was one of the panelists at the discussion.

356
00:53:35,854 --> 00:53:41,777
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was able to speak with her after the event, and she kind of illustrates some of the things that City Year was doing.

357
00:53:41,897 --> 00:53:46,339
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was a senior at the time, and it really excited me about what they were offering students.

358
00:53:47,338 --> 00:54:02,434
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in the major city and I thought that it was a really cool opportunity for people who are graduating from high school and college and that that you know gap year period where you kind of had some more time to discern your interest in what you want to pursue, and so I was able to apply and work in.

359
00:54:02,714 --> 00:54:10,921
[SPEAKER_00]: in close proximity with her city or Boston's headquarters is the same headquarters building as city or as the entire nonprofit, I still believe.

360
00:54:10,941 --> 00:54:22,150
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was a really cool opportunity for me to be in that space and see, I think people who were super charged about the educational opportunity that they were offering to students and supportive of our teachers.

361
00:54:22,191 --> 00:54:26,554
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was what got me excited and interested in the program originally about five, six years ago.

362
00:54:26,574 --> 00:54:30,157
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

363
00:54:30,578 --> 00:54:30,698
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

364
00:54:30,718 --> 00:54:30,958
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

365
00:54:31,664 --> 00:54:31,724
[SPEAKER_11]: you.

366
00:54:31,744 --> 00:54:37,485
[SPEAKER_11]: Is if you're else finished member, so invite Monica Roberts to say a few words.

367
00:54:40,126 --> 00:54:41,146
[SPEAKER_01]: Monica Welcome.

368
00:54:41,646 --> 00:54:42,206
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening.

369
00:54:42,246 --> 00:54:42,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

370
00:54:42,627 --> 00:54:45,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, uh, mayor and all the members of the school committee.

371
00:54:45,947 --> 00:54:53,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Um and thank you for, uh, committee member on the party for being such a wonderful spokesperson talking about the

372
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:03,156
[SPEAKER_01]: in brief talk about the program since it's been talked about quite a bit and then answer the questions that I heard.

373
00:55:04,036 --> 00:55:09,922
[SPEAKER_01]: So City Year typically will place a team of about six young people in a building at the elementary level.

374
00:55:10,163 --> 00:55:14,567
[SPEAKER_01]: They're generally following, they stay with their teacher through the course of the year.

375
00:55:15,088 --> 00:55:18,812
[SPEAKER_01]: They start at the beginning of the school year and then June when they

376
00:55:19,392 --> 00:55:20,692
[SPEAKER_01]: graduate from our program.

377
00:55:21,473 --> 00:55:23,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Our young people are ages 18 to 25.

378
00:55:24,713 --> 00:55:31,095
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say about a third are high school grads, two-thirds are college grads typically in our core.

379
00:55:31,935 --> 00:55:39,717
[SPEAKER_01]: This past year, about 52% were BIPOC or identified as BIPOC and were multilingual or bilingual.

380
00:55:40,417 --> 00:55:48,222
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we think about that as we're placing them in addition to making sure that they're appropriately placed in terms of their skills.

381
00:55:49,183 --> 00:55:55,447
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, of course, by age, our high school grads are serving in elementary schools, our college grads are serving in middle and high schools.

382
00:55:58,591 --> 00:56:01,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Our core members do focus on ELA and math.

383
00:56:01,492 --> 00:56:14,738
[SPEAKER_01]: So I believe those two core skills and making sure young people understand them and are able to do that work in the classroom, working alongside the teacher with a list of students that we call a focus list of kids who are either off track or need keep up support.

384
00:56:15,859 --> 00:56:20,401
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do that work in small groups or an individual one-on-one support.

385
00:56:21,201 --> 00:56:26,886
[SPEAKER_01]: Our goal is not to supplant any work that educators are doing in a building, we are to supplement.

386
00:56:26,926 --> 00:56:39,897
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of what we do to manage for that is we have an impact manager who's assigned to your school, who is managing that team, who is meeting with the teachers, who is responsible for that school partnership and meeting with the school leader to make sure that we are on track

387
00:56:40,618 --> 00:57:06,833
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have an instructional coach who comes and does work and observations with our AmeriCorps members to see how they're doing in the classroom, working with the teacher, how they're working with the young people and to coach them around that work so that while they're not trained teachers, we are really doing work to help them understand how you both build relationship and how do you deliver academic content though you are not educating yourself and so providing that supplemental support.

388
00:57:08,388 --> 00:57:19,922
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition to that, I do visit every school partnership, including Observations myself, and that is in part A, I want to hear from educators, I want to hear from the school leader, I want to hear from our AmeriCorps members.

389
00:57:20,342 --> 00:57:26,169
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really my dipsticking to see how we're doing, what's effective, what's not effective, and what do we need to do differently.

390
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:32,573
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're constantly fine tuning our process to make sure that we're delivering the best service at the end of the day.

391
00:57:33,233 --> 00:57:35,914
[SPEAKER_01]: Our desire is to have improved student outcomes.

392
00:57:36,874 --> 00:57:38,795
[SPEAKER_01]: For this reason, we also work on attendance.

393
00:57:38,835 --> 00:57:44,978
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of our students are on our list for chronic absenteeism or just attendance challenges, and we do that work.

394
00:57:46,158 --> 00:57:48,661
[SPEAKER_01]: If a school has an attendance team, we do that alongside them.

395
00:57:48,701 --> 00:57:51,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Our impact manager will generally serve on that team.

396
00:57:52,383 --> 00:58:06,455
[SPEAKER_01]: And our core members are able to make phone calls home, which we do training for our impact managers and our core on how to effectively engage families and leverage the opportunities that they have when they see families because they are outside in the morning greeting young people and their families.

397
00:58:07,415 --> 00:58:10,117
[SPEAKER_01]: to support the school around attendance.

398
00:58:10,657 --> 00:58:21,924
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, we talk about social emotional learning and that near peer relationship that allows for mentoring and provides support where young people can have conversations

399
00:58:22,504 --> 00:58:29,345
[SPEAKER_01]: with our AmeriCorps members who are trained then to pass that along to the appropriate person at the school.

400
00:58:29,425 --> 00:58:39,707
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, one of our schools had a student had a gun in the building this last year and that was reported to our team and our team immediately reported that to the school.

401
00:58:39,747 --> 00:58:41,427
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were able to handle that.

402
00:58:41,587 --> 00:58:50,609
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things we find is that that near peer relationship allows for information to come up very quickly that we can then pass on to the appropriate folks at the school who is able

403
00:58:51,687 --> 00:58:52,727
[SPEAKER_01]: to manage and support it.

404
00:58:54,128 --> 00:59:01,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Our core members are typically working about a nine to a nine and a half hour day because they have to earn 1,700 hours in general.

405
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:04,232
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have two types of slots.

406
00:59:04,272 --> 00:59:08,933
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a 1,700 hour slot and a 1,200 hour slot.

407
00:59:08,953 --> 00:59:10,354
[SPEAKER_01]: 1,700 gets you to nine and a half hour day.

408
00:59:10,374 --> 00:59:12,295
[SPEAKER_01]: It's why we're providing before and after school.

409
00:59:12,655 --> 00:59:15,696
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to complete those hours in order to get their education award.

410
00:59:17,449 --> 00:59:23,036
[SPEAKER_01]: The 1,200 hour slot is a 6.5 hour day for your schools.

411
00:59:24,498 --> 00:59:29,964
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we need to have a conversation about which one makes the most sense, but I think initially we've been thinking about the 1,700 hour slots.

412
00:59:36,224 --> 00:59:41,428
[SPEAKER_01]: We call them volunteers because they are getting paid a stipend, that stipend for this year was $27,300.

413
00:59:42,568 --> 00:59:50,814
[SPEAKER_01]: We are working on trying to make the role more financially equitable for young people in a city and area that is very expensive to live in.

414
00:59:51,734 --> 01:00:01,279
[SPEAKER_01]: And knowing that the hours that they're putting in and with the additional planning that they may have to do on the weekends, they may not be able to hold a second job.

415
01:00:01,899 --> 01:00:06,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Many times there, I find very few people are able to hold a second job and or take classes.

416
01:00:06,782 --> 01:00:09,043
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is their commitment for this year.

417
01:00:09,483 --> 01:00:10,804
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is what they get.

418
01:00:11,304 --> 01:00:12,405
[SPEAKER_01]: They do get some benefits.

419
01:00:13,005 --> 01:00:14,565
[SPEAKER_01]: So they get medical benefits another.

420
01:00:14,585 --> 01:00:24,069
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the, the hundred thousand dollars for the year supports a portion of that we fundraise for the other portion and bring the other portion to the table.

421
01:00:26,536 --> 01:00:41,606
[SPEAKER_01]: We also the one program that won't be able to place there this year, but as you're thinking about out years and whether the partnership is something that you want to do, we have a teacher fellows program and partnership with UMass Boston, where our AmeriCorps members are able to come back for a second or third year.

422
01:00:42,918 --> 01:00:46,161
[SPEAKER_01]: And they take their coursework at UMass Boston in the evening.

423
01:00:46,241 --> 01:00:48,963
[SPEAKER_01]: They are enrolled in a master's of education program.

424
01:00:49,924 --> 01:00:53,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Their city year training during the course of that year is their practicum.

425
01:00:53,246 --> 01:00:55,468
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are in a classroom with the teacher full time.

426
01:00:55,508 --> 01:01:02,454
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit different from our typical AmeriCorps member experience because those AmeriCorps members are doing before and after school.

427
01:01:02,514 --> 01:01:04,115
[SPEAKER_01]: This person is training to be a teacher.

428
01:01:04,155 --> 01:01:06,477
[SPEAKER_01]: And so their sole focus is doing that work with the teacher.

429
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:10,218
[SPEAKER_01]: For the first half of the year, they're supporting and working with the teacher.

430
01:01:10,238 --> 01:01:14,438
[SPEAKER_01]: For the second half of the year, they are running the classroom and the teacher's coaching.

431
01:01:15,379 --> 01:01:24,080
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically what we find is that the schools that are training these teachers are often able to recruit them, and it's been a great pipeline program.

432
01:01:24,980 --> 01:01:33,562
[SPEAKER_01]: So our fellows for this year have already been placed, but I think as we look into out years, it's a great opportunity to think about if you are looking to build your teacher pipeline,

433
01:01:35,243 --> 01:01:43,690
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really good program, and our AmeriCorps members are usually able to complete the program if they are leveraging all of their Ed Awards for as little as $2,000 to $4,000.

434
01:01:43,870 --> 01:01:46,732
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a great benefit for them.

435
01:01:46,812 --> 01:01:48,193
[SPEAKER_01]: We pay for the Intels.

436
01:01:48,293 --> 01:01:49,394
[SPEAKER_01]: We pay for all their testing.

437
01:01:49,434 --> 01:01:53,617
[SPEAKER_01]: They are all dual or triple certified when they complete our program.

438
01:01:54,898 --> 01:01:59,382
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll pause there and see if there's anything that there may be questions.

439
01:02:00,082 --> 01:02:00,343
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

440
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,865
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much, Monica.

441
01:02:03,956 --> 01:02:04,336
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

442
01:02:05,037 --> 01:02:11,661
[SPEAKER_17]: Are these fellows considered employees or, and therefore getting, you know, Social Security benefits and all that stuff contributed?

443
01:02:12,922 --> 01:02:17,546
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they're considered, because they're considered volunteers, they get the stipend.

444
01:02:17,586 --> 01:02:20,087
[SPEAKER_01]: They do get, they do, they can opt.

445
01:02:20,848 --> 01:02:24,811
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on how they choose to do their taxes.

446
01:02:24,871 --> 01:02:26,672
[SPEAKER_01]: So they do pay taxes and those things.

447
01:02:27,212 --> 01:02:30,855
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it depends on the individual in terms of what they pay into.

448
01:02:32,264 --> 01:02:38,928
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, so they would be paying both sides of Social Security, Medicare out of the 27,300.

449
01:02:40,429 --> 01:02:47,393
[SPEAKER_17]: So that, you know, when we think about most minimum wage workers, they are also getting the employers paying for all of that stuff.

450
01:02:47,993 --> 01:02:52,516
[SPEAKER_01]: So- And we pay for some, we do have to pay the employer's share.

451
01:02:53,917 --> 01:02:55,218
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, you do pay the employer's share?

452
01:02:55,258 --> 01:02:57,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, we're not making, yes, yes, sir.

453
01:02:57,219 --> 01:02:59,180
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, so they're, okay, thank you.

454
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:00,381
[SPEAKER_17]: I was a little confused on that, thank you.

455
01:03:01,869 --> 01:03:13,051
[SPEAKER_17]: And as for what they would do in the school, and I realize these are early days in this conversation, but I've heard people say they could be substitutes, they could help when their paras are out.

456
01:03:14,351 --> 01:03:30,394
[SPEAKER_17]: And those are, well, I don't actually think substitutes are part of any of our CBA, any of our contracts, but I am deeply concerned that we're going to have them fill in for work because we can't find employees to fill jobs

457
01:03:31,482 --> 01:03:33,243
[SPEAKER_17]: that we have posted in our schools.

458
01:03:33,704 --> 01:03:39,547
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, that's just not allowed.

459
01:03:39,688 --> 01:03:44,671
[SPEAKER_17]: You can't just have non-union workers taking over union work, regardless of why.

460
01:03:46,152 --> 01:03:49,094
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I mean, and I don't think that's, that's certainly not a question for you, Ms.

461
01:03:49,134 --> 01:03:57,379
[SPEAKER_17]: Roberts, because that's a superintendent issue and perhaps a school committee discussion as well.

462
01:04:00,579 --> 01:04:13,765
[SPEAKER_17]: And so $100,000, a team of six at $27,300, I mean, that's not even covering the cost.

463
01:04:14,466 --> 01:04:17,087
[SPEAKER_17]: So where does the rest of the money come from?

464
01:04:17,107 --> 01:04:18,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Fundraising.

465
01:04:19,328 --> 01:04:19,528
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

466
01:04:19,628 --> 01:04:29,413
[SPEAKER_01]: So a big part of my job is also fundraising on the other end, looking for public, corporate, individual, and foundation dollars.

467
01:04:31,101 --> 01:04:31,402
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

468
01:04:41,687 --> 01:04:42,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, thank you.

469
01:04:42,928 --> 01:04:47,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to repeat the questions from Member Ruseau and Member Olapade.

470
01:04:48,072 --> 01:05:04,163
[SPEAKER_05]: I do want to say I've worked with a number of programs in this sort of thing, and I have found that City Year is one of the more supportive, providing the support to employees than some of the other similar programs and even those as part of the AmeriCorps program.

471
01:05:04,203 --> 01:05:06,645
[SPEAKER_05]: I found City Year to be really a solid

472
01:05:07,345 --> 01:05:07,725
[SPEAKER_05]: partner.

473
01:05:07,745 --> 01:05:14,291
[SPEAKER_05]: The question that I have maybe is for the administration more than you, Ms.

474
01:05:14,331 --> 01:05:20,495
[SPEAKER_05]: Roberts, it's around what this looks like in terms of planning coming into the school year.

475
01:05:20,555 --> 01:05:30,083
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we've, anyone who has been in education or well really many, many jobs, it's not exclusive to education, has had a student teacher, an intern come in and that can often be

476
01:05:30,683 --> 01:05:34,466
[SPEAKER_05]: more work for the person supervising, obviously for great benefit.

477
01:05:34,546 --> 01:05:43,834
[SPEAKER_05]: I really, really support programs that are teaching these skills and giving these community collaborations an opportunity to grow.

478
01:05:43,854 --> 01:05:48,658
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not about that, but what kind of foundation and conversations

479
01:05:49,398 --> 01:06:03,434
[SPEAKER_05]: would we be having with the teachers and the administration in the schools, particularly noting that we are now in the summer period and many of the staff will be coming back right before school starts and moving in.

480
01:06:03,535 --> 01:06:08,520
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a question about onboarding and the commitment for what it looks like on the ground for

481
01:06:09,321 --> 01:06:11,943
[SPEAKER_05]: really being able to get this going.

482
01:06:12,064 --> 01:06:27,337
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate what Member Olapade said, that this is an and, not an or, but even adding ands to the top of already very full jobs is a lot of work, and I'd love to hear about how that is managed.

483
01:06:29,411 --> 01:06:37,338
[SPEAKER_01]: I can start by sharing kind of what we have done and then certainly the superintendent I'm sure will have some other thoughts.

484
01:06:38,179 --> 01:06:49,448
[SPEAKER_01]: So we typically will have our team come in when teachers are starting one just to get folks acclimated to meet the team, to connect, to hear a little bit about our program.

485
01:06:49,488 --> 01:06:57,435
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like generally to start with an informational session for the staff and the school leaders so they understand what they're getting.

486
01:06:58,275 --> 01:07:01,277
[SPEAKER_01]: We do not force teachers to take us on.

487
01:07:01,338 --> 01:07:07,322
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, in terms of our conditions of success, we want teachers who are AmeriCorps members in the classroom.

488
01:07:08,023 --> 01:07:10,565
[SPEAKER_01]: We can talk with them about the deep training we do.

489
01:07:10,625 --> 01:07:12,866
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a month of training before the school year starts.

490
01:07:12,946 --> 01:07:20,132
[SPEAKER_01]: We do partner with our two other district partners, Boston and Everett, to provide training on supporting ELs, English learners.

491
01:07:20,612 --> 01:07:26,097
[SPEAKER_01]: And students with disabilities also getting certified and mental health and wellness as well.

492
01:07:26,157 --> 01:07:32,582
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of support that happens that we would share with your educators and then we have a matching process.

493
01:07:32,602 --> 01:07:36,705
[SPEAKER_01]: So, after teachers face a hand, they say, this is I'm interested.

494
01:07:36,845 --> 01:07:39,588
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to match them with a AmeriCorps member.

495
01:07:40,588 --> 01:07:46,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Our impact manager who's on the ground is going in the classrooms, having conversations, doing observations, seeing how it's going.

496
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:54,713
[SPEAKER_01]: In the case that it's not working, we will pull an AmeriCorps member out of the classroom and try to find a more suitable placement for them.

497
01:07:55,553 --> 01:07:58,154
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do try to be flexible.

498
01:07:58,234 --> 01:08:07,477
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think thinking about the startup time, given where we are in the school year, is something that we can do to make sure it works for the schools and the educators.

499
01:08:08,277 --> 01:08:19,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, the other part of that was making sure the teachers and support staff that are being worked with have the opportunity to express that this is our specific need in this specific year.

500
01:08:21,041 --> 01:08:28,907
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's part of what we call the hour one conversations that the impact manager has with the individual teachers who raised their hand.

501
01:08:28,947 --> 01:08:30,969
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do collect kind of what they're looking for.

502
01:08:30,989 --> 01:08:34,791
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's that's part of what how we are able to match our educators.

503
01:08:34,811 --> 01:08:40,936
[SPEAKER_01]: The one other thing I didn't get to say at all times, our core members must have a staff person in the building.

504
01:08:40,976 --> 01:08:42,437
[SPEAKER_01]: So the concern about.

505
01:08:44,038 --> 01:08:50,642
[SPEAKER_01]: if a teacher is out, them being the substitute, you actually have to have another adult in the classroom.

506
01:08:50,702 --> 01:09:03,710
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what is helpful is often they are the through line because they've been with the classroom teachers, so they know the content and they can provide a lot of support to the substitute to making sure that the students are not missing anything in the interim.

507
01:09:06,832 --> 01:09:08,613
[SPEAKER_14]: And thank you.

508
01:09:08,653 --> 01:09:09,894
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Edmundson and then member Graham.

509
01:09:10,509 --> 01:09:10,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

510
01:09:11,170 --> 01:09:20,060
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to comment member Reinfeld that I have been in communication with Monica and in addition to that Miss Roberts.

511
01:09:21,622 --> 01:09:26,588
[SPEAKER_14]: I have had a preliminary conversation with the new administration at the Mississippi

512
01:09:27,569 --> 01:09:31,313
[SPEAKER_14]: and saying that, you know, we are presenting this before the committee.

513
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:42,486
[SPEAKER_14]: They both are eager and excited if it is actually a possibility that if the committee agrees that it's something that we can go forward with.

514
01:09:42,586 --> 01:09:46,370
[SPEAKER_14]: They are excited about having the opportunity to have

515
01:09:47,671 --> 01:09:50,293
[SPEAKER_14]: an AmeriCorps team supporting the school.

516
01:09:50,974 --> 01:09:57,559
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, it's not to supplant anything, but it's truly to support the work that's happening there.

517
01:09:58,419 --> 01:10:03,903
[SPEAKER_14]: And they have a lot of excitement and enthusiasm for the new year that is coming forward.

518
01:10:04,704 --> 01:10:07,225
[SPEAKER_14]: And we would continue to plan.

519
01:10:07,926 --> 01:10:08,987
[SPEAKER_14]: And as Ms.

520
01:10:09,027 --> 01:10:14,291
[SPEAKER_14]: Roberts explained, that there's a lot of training that the Corps members go through over the course of the summer.

521
01:10:15,151 --> 01:10:25,600
[SPEAKER_14]: so that if the committee were to agree, the court, the team would not be assigned to Medford Public Schools until August to have an opportunity to interact.

522
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:35,848
[SPEAKER_14]: And so while people are on summer break, again, I'm not sure if there's an opportunity to do something mid-summer or earlier in August to have

523
01:10:37,745 --> 01:10:40,529
[SPEAKER_14]: know, an opportunity to do a meet and greet.

524
01:10:41,210 --> 01:10:49,921
[SPEAKER_14]: But the benefits, there are so many benefits to having a city or team at a school.

525
01:10:49,941 --> 01:10:53,566
[SPEAKER_14]: If it wasn't something where

526
01:10:55,655 --> 01:11:11,243
[SPEAKER_14]: we had to be more cautious, I would have been asking for a team to be assigned to all four of our elementary schools if that had been an option.

527
01:11:11,384 --> 01:11:19,568
[SPEAKER_14]: But to start off and to start off with a smaller pilot, that's what the thinking of our team is here.

528
01:11:19,588 --> 01:11:21,689
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

529
01:11:22,229 --> 01:11:22,650
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

530
01:11:22,890 --> 01:11:23,290
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham?

531
01:11:26,442 --> 01:11:26,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

532
01:11:27,283 --> 01:11:32,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, does I think this is a question for Miss Roberts.

533
01:11:33,329 --> 01:11:42,818
[SPEAKER_07]: What kind of supports does city air provide to its staff, given that that stipend would not allow you to live in the area, right?

534
01:11:42,898 --> 01:11:44,800
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is not enough money to

535
01:11:46,872 --> 01:11:48,936
[SPEAKER_07]: pay rent, eat, do all those things.

536
01:11:49,016 --> 01:11:56,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there other supports that you're providing to the team so that they can actually live in the area that they are working in?

537
01:11:57,631 --> 01:12:03,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, so we do provide support to our national office on finding housing.

538
01:12:03,253 --> 01:12:12,676
[SPEAKER_01]: We get a lot of information so that folks are able to find housing that is affordable and also to do some roommate matching.

539
01:12:12,716 --> 01:12:16,457
[SPEAKER_01]: So often some AmeriCorps members are kind of housing together.

540
01:12:17,377 --> 01:12:24,900
[SPEAKER_01]: For folks who are moving, we do provide what I would call a housing stipend to support them in their move in addition to that.

541
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:33,929
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a person in our local office who provides support in terms of any other needs they may have.

542
01:12:33,969 --> 01:12:37,412
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, we did have some folks who ended up homeless last year.

543
01:12:37,472 --> 01:12:41,397
[SPEAKER_01]: So we paid for a hotel and helped them find housing.

544
01:12:41,437 --> 01:12:45,381
[SPEAKER_01]: So we understand that there were a lot of challenges and that these are young people.

545
01:12:45,441 --> 01:12:48,264
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are also providing that additional support.

546
01:12:49,685 --> 01:12:56,212
[SPEAKER_01]: The other things I'll say that we are helping them on while they're in City Year is really their life after City Year.

547
01:12:56,232 --> 01:13:03,741
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is their long term plan, getting them into college or programs that might provide economic mobility as well.

548
01:13:04,161 --> 01:13:07,525
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're kind of looking at the trajectory while they're with us and then beyond.

549
01:13:10,900 --> 01:13:31,959
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I think this question is maybe for the superintendent, in terms of like how you envision these teams being used, I guess like the things that I started thinking about immediately are some of our operational challenges around substitute coverage around after school, but it sounds like substitute coverage is not an option in terms of how they work with our, with our staff.

550
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:49,484
[SPEAKER_07]: So would these students, like if they're in the classroom working with teachers, I think the question about union work is a good one to be asking to make sure that we're not tripping on our bargaining obligations.

551
01:13:50,665 --> 01:13:58,467
[SPEAKER_07]: But also if we were to try to think about like the afterschool challenge of capacity in,

552
01:13:59,827 --> 01:14:00,687
[SPEAKER_07]: some of the buildings.

553
01:14:00,807 --> 01:14:13,192
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Brooks is sort of an anomaly because the program is too big for the building, but at Missittuck and McGlynn and Roberts for sure, there is some capacity, I think, to expand the program.

554
01:14:13,592 --> 01:14:23,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Would these staff being infused into the afterschool program allow us to take more students into the program that Megan runs?

555
01:14:25,285 --> 01:14:40,450
[SPEAKER_14]: So I did have a preliminary conversation with Megan Fidler-Carey, and she was very excited about the prospect of having additional members to support the work that is happening.

556
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:43,371
[SPEAKER_14]: There are some stipulations, which Ms.

557
01:14:43,431 --> 01:14:47,332
[SPEAKER_14]: Roberts was talking about with the team, but part of it is.

558
01:14:47,952 --> 01:14:50,634
[SPEAKER_14]: that they are able to support that programming.

559
01:14:51,755 --> 01:15:13,013
[SPEAKER_14]: So if a core member was, depending on the size of the space and depending on the total number of students, they could be supporting supervision and instruction if they were in a cafeteria space and there was still another adult there to provide additional supervision and support.

560
01:15:13,613 --> 01:15:26,138
[SPEAKER_14]: So that is one of the key pieces of them having access to another adult administrator to support whatever the work is that they're doing.

561
01:15:26,198 --> 01:15:36,282
[SPEAKER_14]: So even if it is the before and after school programming, they could be working with a group of students and you could still have the after school team leader

562
01:15:38,203 --> 01:15:50,509
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, supervising the work that all the people are doing and that the core members would be able to be working with students under that same level of supervision.

563
01:15:51,590 --> 01:16:02,575
[SPEAKER_14]: So it is, in essence, yes, it could work, and they would be able to increase capacity, keeping those parameters in mind.

564
01:16:03,703 --> 01:16:10,902
[SPEAKER_07]: And so tactically, do you have a number of people that we could take off the wait list and place into the program?

565
01:16:12,461 --> 01:16:16,262
[SPEAKER_14]: So I did not ask Ms.

566
01:16:16,282 --> 01:16:25,883
[SPEAKER_14]: Fidler-Carey about what the wait list would look like and how many more people could potentially be added.

567
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,203
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't ask that question.

568
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:41,686
[SPEAKER_14]: I just said that I was, I shared with her that I was presenting this evening to the committee and that I would defer to the committee and I would have additional information later in the week to let her know which way

569
01:16:43,806 --> 01:16:48,728
[SPEAKER_14]: So she is aware, but I did not ask for that next piece of information.

570
01:16:48,788 --> 01:17:00,491
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, based on the guidelines of how they've explained how we can use the City Year core members, we definitely would be able to increase

571
01:17:01,391 --> 01:17:08,577
[SPEAKER_14]: capacity because they would be supervised by one of the after school leaders that are there.

572
01:17:08,597 --> 01:17:11,819
[SPEAKER_14]: There are leaders and there are assistant leaders.

573
01:17:12,280 --> 01:17:19,025
[SPEAKER_14]: So there is a ratio that is in place and they would be able to provide further support for our community.

574
01:17:20,967 --> 01:17:24,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I think I would definitely be interested in knowing how do we quantify that because

575
01:17:27,327 --> 01:17:30,650
[SPEAKER_07]: that's an important and ongoing discussion that we're sort of always having.

576
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:33,012
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have wait lists in all the buildings.

577
01:17:33,172 --> 01:17:40,398
[SPEAKER_07]: So if there is like a quantifiable way to say what we would be able to do, that would, I think, be ideal.

578
01:17:41,118 --> 01:17:47,383
[SPEAKER_07]: The other question I have is about the work that they're doing in collaboration with a teacher in a classroom.

579
01:17:47,964 --> 01:17:51,507
[SPEAKER_07]: How are they trained on the curricula that our teachers are using?

580
01:17:51,647 --> 01:17:53,668
[SPEAKER_07]: So I know we have been like,

581
01:17:54,409 --> 01:18:00,894
[SPEAKER_07]: sort of fighting the good fight around the science of reading and using evidence-based instruction.

582
01:18:00,914 --> 01:18:16,207
[SPEAKER_07]: And I am a little nervous about tutors in the mix who may not be apprised of all of those things that our teachers are sort of on the front lines of every single day.

583
01:18:16,307 --> 01:18:19,109
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was just curious, and maybe that's a question for Ms.

584
01:18:19,149 --> 01:18:21,992
[SPEAKER_07]: Roberts, how that works.

585
01:18:23,188 --> 01:18:32,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think we try to do two things that will be a little more challenging for this year, but typically our AmeriCorps members are training with our district partners.

586
01:18:32,918 --> 01:18:38,084
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Boston and Everett, they are being trained in their literacy and math initiatives.

587
01:18:38,564 --> 01:18:42,448
[SPEAKER_01]: Boston is providing additional training on how to do intervention services.

588
01:18:42,528 --> 01:18:44,551
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is something that we can do alongside.

589
01:18:45,773 --> 01:18:53,714
[SPEAKER_01]: your educators, or if there's someone from your team, we can bring them to train our team over the course of the summer as they're here getting training for a month.

590
01:18:54,656 --> 01:19:07,625
[SPEAKER_01]: The second thing we do is our AmeriCorps members, we ask teachers to have planning time with their AmeriCorps member so they understand the content that they're going to be covering for the day and how they might approach delivering it.

591
01:19:07,665 --> 01:19:18,432
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's part of what we try to create in terms of the structure so that there's that planning time and the AmeriCorps member isn't doing something differently than the classroom teacher would do.

592
01:19:20,610 --> 01:19:34,438
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on a question of after school, I'm gonna try to get a firm number for you, but I think typically in most of our schools, one AmeriCorps member is supporting anywhere from five to 10 young people, depending on the model of the program.

593
01:19:35,198 --> 01:19:41,162
[SPEAKER_01]: We both run our own programs and we are also expanding capacity in existing programs.

594
01:19:41,642 --> 01:19:46,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Understanding that you have an existing program, happy to do that, and we've done that elsewhere.

595
01:19:46,104 --> 01:19:49,066
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

596
01:19:52,523 --> 01:19:52,943
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

597
01:19:52,963 --> 01:19:53,304
[SPEAKER_11]: Roberts.

598
01:19:55,265 --> 01:20:19,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Just to piggyback from the chair, if I may, on Member Graham's point, I think we did have discussion on the afterschool programming piece in the past, and I think we all agreed that we were going to try to, this would be a great addition, obviously, for afterschool programming, but also make sure that we don't create more spots for one year and then can't fulfill them the year after is one

599
01:20:21,052 --> 01:20:22,332
[SPEAKER_11]: thing we just want to think through.

600
01:20:22,432 --> 01:20:34,337
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the second is, are we going to be working throughout the summer to increase hiring, especially at three schools where we have the 60 students in the after school program?

601
01:20:34,357 --> 01:20:39,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we did make a recommendation that we try to increase the other three schools.

602
01:20:39,679 --> 01:20:40,759
[SPEAKER_11]: I know the Brooks is at over 120.

603
01:20:40,799 --> 01:20:45,100
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want to make sure that's still in the works.

604
01:20:45,120 --> 01:20:46,741
[SPEAKER_11]: 2020, 2021, 2022, we're hiring.

605
01:20:50,218 --> 01:20:56,673
[SPEAKER_11]: to hire, I know that, but I'm hoping we make some strides this summer to increase, get some of those children off the wait list.

606
01:20:59,159 --> 01:20:59,761
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Reinfeld?

607
01:21:01,226 --> 01:21:13,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I could, I apologize, this might have been said already, but is the third, we're talking about an elementary school and a single classroom, is the third grade a fixed point?

608
01:21:13,290 --> 01:21:22,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think the schools that we're looking at, particularly the Mississippi is where we've had a lot of concerns about the average class size being a lot for a single teacher.

609
01:21:23,353 --> 01:21:26,614
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not necessarily in the third grade, for example, so.

610
01:21:29,275 --> 01:21:33,037
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of, how does this intersect with our class size questions?

611
01:21:35,439 --> 01:21:37,080
[SPEAKER_05]: We're having another adult in the room.

612
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:41,283
[SPEAKER_01]: I can share that we do grades three to 10.

613
01:21:42,504 --> 01:21:53,312
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're able to do those grades depending on what the school leader thinks are the needs and where teachers are willing to raise their hand to have an AmeriCorps member.

614
01:21:54,793 --> 01:21:56,775
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not fixed for a particular grade.

615
01:21:57,075 --> 01:21:57,295
Thank you.

616
01:22:00,404 --> 01:22:01,425
[SPEAKER_11]: That's great, yes, thank you.

617
01:22:03,266 --> 01:22:06,489
[SPEAKER_11]: And then just the funding source for this.

618
01:22:06,609 --> 01:22:08,370
[SPEAKER_11]: If we had one team, it's $100,000.

619
01:22:09,050 --> 01:22:10,031
[SPEAKER_11]: If we have two teams, it's $200,000.

620
01:22:13,447 --> 01:22:27,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, and I spoke with Mr. McHugh and where the city year model, the model that we were talking about includes expanded day before and after school programming.

621
01:22:29,642 --> 01:22:34,286
[SPEAKER_14]: Jerry did say a portion of that money could be used.

622
01:22:35,347 --> 01:22:39,350
[SPEAKER_14]: We could authentically use some of our before and after school programming money.

623
01:22:40,359 --> 01:22:51,470
[SPEAKER_14]: to support City Year because they would be offering extended day support to our students and then we would look at

624
01:22:52,762 --> 01:22:57,024
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, either other revolving accounts or other areas to supplement.

625
01:22:57,704 --> 01:23:01,466
[SPEAKER_14]: So, and when I spoke with Ms.

626
01:23:01,526 --> 01:23:08,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Megan Fidler-Carey, she too was just excited about the opportunity to have the additional support.

627
01:23:09,669 --> 01:23:15,571
[SPEAKER_14]: And I said to her, you know, we could try to use a little bit of the before and after school funding.

628
01:23:16,191 --> 01:23:19,353
[SPEAKER_14]: And she was definitely in support of that.

629
01:23:19,873 --> 01:23:22,094
[SPEAKER_14]: And Mr. McHugh is right, right?

630
01:23:23,424 --> 01:23:34,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, yeah, that makes sense, because we'll be able to hopefully accept more children off the wait list, bringing in more funding to hopefully support at least a portion of this funding need.

631
01:23:35,092 --> 01:23:35,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

632
01:23:36,013 --> 01:23:36,973
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a motion on the floor?

633
01:23:37,994 --> 01:23:39,615
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Rousseau, then Member Intoppa?

634
01:23:41,657 --> 01:23:42,577
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Intoppa was first.

635
01:23:43,638 --> 01:23:45,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Intoppa, then Member Rousseau?

636
01:23:45,999 --> 01:23:48,800
[SPEAKER_19]: And thank you everyone for giving this valuable information.

637
01:23:48,820 --> 01:24:13,026
[SPEAKER_19]: I think, you know, from what it sounds like the city, your program is a phenomenal program to help, you know, professionally develop students, you know, at a time in their life after high school, uh, my initial concern was about the funding portion, but the a hundred thousand or the 200,000 and, you know, scraping from revolving funds or from the before and after school program, because I know we're still, we're, it's on the agenda tonight to talk about the budget and we're, you know,

638
01:24:13,885 --> 01:24:17,715
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not ideal what we're doing in the budget, and we're trying to fit in a $100,000, possibly $200,000 program.

639
01:24:20,612 --> 01:24:23,593
[SPEAKER_19]: that I don't know if spend budgeted for in the budget.

640
01:24:23,733 --> 01:24:30,395
[SPEAKER_19]: And that part sort of just concerns me a little bit, I guess, to put it out there before we vote.

641
01:24:30,815 --> 01:24:39,017
[SPEAKER_19]: And also, is this vote to start negotiations, to start talks, or is this vote to approve the actual program?

642
01:24:39,877 --> 01:24:45,819
[SPEAKER_19]: Because while it seems like an amazing program, and from what I could tell, it really is, I just have concerns about bringing it in a time

643
01:24:46,619 --> 01:24:53,661
[SPEAKER_19]: where we're doing layoffs and scraping revolving funds to just get by for a level service, and we're trying to introduce more.

644
01:24:55,702 --> 01:25:00,583
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm sorry to be so negative about that, but that's just sort of where my concerns are at.

645
01:25:04,445 --> 01:25:05,305
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Member Intoppa.

646
01:25:05,325 --> 01:25:15,588
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if anybody has any response to that, but I'll go to Member Ruseau until

647
01:25:17,021 --> 01:25:17,302
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

648
01:25:17,362 --> 01:25:20,464
[SPEAKER_17]: And I appreciate member and tapas point about.

649
01:25:21,806 --> 01:25:25,629
[SPEAKER_17]: Adding anything an additional new expense at a time when we're.

650
01:25:26,710 --> 01:25:29,833
[SPEAKER_17]: About to have a discussion about our budget and the layoffs that are involved in that.

651
01:25:30,473 --> 01:25:34,417
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's an exceptionally good point and a little embarrassed.

652
01:25:34,437 --> 01:25:37,099
[SPEAKER_17]: We didn't get to that one already, but, um.

653
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:38,861
[SPEAKER_17]: The, um.

654
01:25:40,183 --> 01:25:47,067
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel like there's significant critical questions we need answers to aside from the funding.

655
01:25:49,468 --> 01:25:56,813
[SPEAKER_17]: I think knowing that our union partners are okay with this is not unimportant.

656
01:25:58,534 --> 01:26:03,977
[SPEAKER_17]: And the deployment, I feel like a plan should, even a,

657
01:26:04,893 --> 01:26:15,056
[SPEAKER_17]: generic, you know, wireframe plan of what this would look like without, obviously, you won't have the information about which teachers raise their hands.

658
01:26:15,276 --> 01:26:19,578
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, you know, you're not going to have that happen until after we're already like, yes, we're going.

659
01:26:21,118 --> 01:26:29,541
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, after school, that sounds fine, except that they can't be the after school people that are

660
01:26:32,458 --> 01:26:46,228
[SPEAKER_17]: replacing the other adults we would want to have and expanding afterschool for one year so that next year we are going to be in crisis mode because we are going to have fewer people to staff it.

661
01:26:46,489 --> 01:26:51,673
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's one thing to be on a wait list and to be like, I wish I could have gotten afterschool care.

662
01:26:52,313 --> 01:26:54,395
[SPEAKER_17]: And then it's another thing to get it and then

663
01:26:55,829 --> 01:27:03,958
[SPEAKER_17]: 12 months later, be told you had a spot, you don't have a spot anymore because we just can't recruit enough people to fill those spots.

664
01:27:04,398 --> 01:27:15,469
[SPEAKER_17]: And that concerns me about any times we talk about expanding after school is that I feel like after school, the staff spends an enormous amount of time trying to find staff.

665
01:27:16,370 --> 01:27:16,551
[SPEAKER_17]: And

666
01:27:18,391 --> 01:27:21,293
[SPEAKER_17]: that's just a permanent problem of afterschool programs everywhere.

667
01:27:22,334 --> 01:27:41,606
[SPEAKER_17]: So the idea of having more space is delightful, I think, especially if you have a kid and you need it, but I don't know that we want to make a bed of crisis that we're gonna have to all lay in a year from now or a year after when the city year has not continued.

668
01:27:44,148 --> 01:27:44,789
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know,

669
01:27:47,129 --> 01:27:55,137
[SPEAKER_17]: I do just have some, you know, those are my big concerns and I feel like I would rather have answers before we approve continuing with this.

670
01:27:55,237 --> 01:28:04,125
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we could get those answers at another meeting, I think that would be a better time to motion to approve this.

671
01:28:04,225 --> 01:28:06,928
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I mean, I'd like to motion to table it to our next meeting.

672
01:28:08,422 --> 01:28:15,605
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to say through the chair that there is another neighboring community that is also on the table.

673
01:28:16,626 --> 01:28:20,868
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was very excited and appreciative that Ms.

674
01:28:20,888 --> 01:28:32,133
[SPEAKER_14]: Roberts thought of Medford and said, let Medford know that there is the possibility that other community is Somerville.

675
01:28:32,933 --> 01:28:33,413
[SPEAKER_14]: And so

676
01:28:35,254 --> 01:28:42,517
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been here six years, and this is the first time that we got a viable option to get a City Year team.

677
01:28:42,758 --> 01:28:46,479
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not something that is normally readily available.

678
01:28:47,140 --> 01:28:58,025
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, you know, I would just ask the committee to, you know, if you need additional information, I can try to get as much of that information as possible.

679
01:28:58,185 --> 01:29:03,047
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're going to be in July, and if we're not going to be able to go forward, then I know

680
01:29:04,482 --> 01:29:08,125
[SPEAKER_14]: they'll need to go forward with another community or another district.

681
01:29:13,029 --> 01:29:32,424
[SPEAKER_11]: Maybe you can elaborate then, Dr. Edward-Vincent, on what would the plan be if we had 12 students going into college or in college, and then that allowed us to bring in 100 more children to the afterschool program, what will we do the next year?

682
01:29:33,629 --> 01:29:35,669
[SPEAKER_11]: how would we explain it to families?

683
01:29:36,269 --> 01:29:44,811
[SPEAKER_11]: Or are we gonna be trying to hire starting June of 2025 to make sure we can maintain that level?

684
01:29:47,392 --> 01:29:48,652
[SPEAKER_14]: Where Ms.

685
01:29:48,712 --> 01:29:55,993
[SPEAKER_14]: Roberts gave the ratio that each person could potentially supervise five to 10 students.

686
01:29:56,293 --> 01:29:59,174
[SPEAKER_14]: So if it was 12 that the additional 120

687
01:30:02,293 --> 01:30:14,241
[SPEAKER_14]: seats, I don't have the exact numbers in front of me for the two schools, but what led me to look at the Missittuck and the McGlynn, those are our title one schools.

688
01:30:14,461 --> 01:30:19,744
[SPEAKER_14]: Both of those schools house our newcomer English language learner program.

689
01:30:20,465 --> 01:30:21,926
[SPEAKER_14]: And so Ms.

690
01:30:21,966 --> 01:30:26,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Roberts talked about some of the core members being bilingual,

691
01:30:27,149 --> 01:30:33,190
[SPEAKER_14]: and just thinking about the programming at the McGlynn Complex, which is a K-8 complex.

692
01:30:34,031 --> 01:30:36,771
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I did speak to Ms.

693
01:30:36,831 --> 01:30:42,452
[SPEAKER_14]: Roberts about, you know, there are nearly 1,000 students on that campus.

694
01:30:42,972 --> 01:30:47,793
[SPEAKER_14]: So could we potentially have a team split between both sides?

695
01:30:48,674 --> 01:30:54,335
[SPEAKER_14]: And so thinking, looking at demographics, those are our two schools that have

696
01:30:56,095 --> 01:30:59,597
[SPEAKER_14]: according to DESI, they represent the highest needs.

697
01:31:00,337 --> 01:31:09,121
[SPEAKER_14]: And so I was looking at it from that perspective, starting with the Missituck first.

698
01:31:10,461 --> 01:31:12,922
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what the wait list is.

699
01:31:12,962 --> 01:31:14,723
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if Ms.

700
01:31:14,743 --> 01:31:17,804
[SPEAKER_14]: Galussi might be able to get a hold of Ms.

701
01:31:17,984 --> 01:31:22,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Fidler-Carey to see if there might be some numbers in terms of,

702
01:31:24,755 --> 01:31:29,676
[SPEAKER_14]: for those two programs, but I did ask Ms.

703
01:31:29,716 --> 01:31:31,797
[SPEAKER_14]: Roberts, what happens at the end of the year?

704
01:31:31,997 --> 01:31:51,021
[SPEAKER_14]: I said, if we get two teams and it's incredibly successful, and we would like to go with two additional teams, would we be able to get in queue to receive the two additional teams to support both the Brooks and the Roberts, which equally would benefit?

705
01:31:51,822 --> 01:31:58,260
[SPEAKER_14]: And she said, yes, that would be definitely on the table as an option.

706
01:32:02,402 --> 01:32:04,683
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there's a desire for us to have more seats.

707
01:32:04,803 --> 01:32:07,705
[SPEAKER_14]: We have applied.

708
01:32:08,725 --> 01:32:08,886
[SPEAKER_14]: Ms.

709
01:32:08,926 --> 01:32:19,331
[SPEAKER_14]: Fidler-Carey is working with Tufts and other partners, constantly trying to see who would like to work those limited amount of hours in an afterschool program.

710
01:32:19,991 --> 01:32:22,893
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's a very fluid population.

711
01:32:22,933 --> 01:32:26,575
[SPEAKER_14]: We hire people, they're with us for a year, and then

712
01:32:27,335 --> 01:32:30,436
[SPEAKER_14]: They go on to do something else or they may graduate from college.

713
01:32:30,936 --> 01:32:32,917
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we're looking to hire new people.

714
01:32:33,918 --> 01:32:36,939
[SPEAKER_14]: So that that work has not stopped.

715
01:32:37,799 --> 01:32:41,901
[SPEAKER_14]: But it is something that's, you know, going to be ongoing.

716
01:32:43,595 --> 01:32:48,136
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I think families would be happy if they knew, okay, we have it this year.

717
01:32:48,956 --> 01:32:51,977
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we know, I don't know at what point in time, Ms.

718
01:32:52,017 --> 01:33:02,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Roberts, you notify districts that they're in queue for the following year so that we could plan accordingly.

719
01:33:02,540 --> 01:33:11,683
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think families would definitely take advantage of this year while something is in place to increase

720
01:33:12,623 --> 01:33:15,145
[SPEAKER_14]: coverage for more students after school care.

721
01:33:16,125 --> 01:33:24,330
[SPEAKER_01]: And apologies for not leading with this, but our goal is never to be in a district or a school for a year and pulling out.

722
01:33:24,911 --> 01:33:35,497
[SPEAKER_01]: So I should say that in establishing a partnership, we're hoping that it can be one that you all find beneficial and that you all will want to keep.

723
01:33:35,757 --> 01:33:39,620
[SPEAKER_01]: So our goal is to really to have roots and to really integrate ourselves

724
01:33:40,120 --> 01:33:43,161
[SPEAKER_01]: That is what makes the City Year model powerful.

725
01:33:43,241 --> 01:33:46,742
[SPEAKER_01]: When I go into a school that has had City Year, I go in with my red jacket.

726
01:33:46,842 --> 01:33:48,042
[SPEAKER_01]: Kids don't need to know my name.

727
01:33:48,082 --> 01:33:49,603
[SPEAKER_01]: The jacket means something to them.

728
01:33:49,623 --> 01:33:54,864
[SPEAKER_01]: They're asking me if I'm a City Year and whose class I'm serving in because the jacket means something to them.

729
01:33:54,904 --> 01:34:01,846
[SPEAKER_01]: So our goal is really to take root and to have a deeper partnership so we would not be looking to pull out next year unless you all

730
01:34:02,946 --> 01:34:05,067
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't find it to be a beneficial partnership.

731
01:34:05,248 --> 01:34:09,330
[SPEAKER_01]: And for that reason, we would be looking to continue after school programming.

732
01:34:10,230 --> 01:34:23,617
[SPEAKER_01]: And if for whatever reason, which happens with some of our school partners, the school is not able to continue its program, our team does develop programs, often they're a mix of enrichment and academic support.

733
01:34:23,657 --> 01:34:25,678
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can do some of that work.

734
01:34:27,379 --> 01:34:33,461
[SPEAKER_01]: and that doesn't, I think, hopefully that answers the questions that you all have, but our goal would be to return.

735
01:34:38,303 --> 01:34:39,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Roberts.

736
01:34:39,224 --> 01:34:40,384
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

737
01:34:40,484 --> 01:34:45,306
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just finished my thought from the chair, and then I'm going to go to Member Bramley and then Member Reinfeld.

738
01:34:46,406 --> 01:34:56,510
[SPEAKER_11]: I think, for me, I'd be a yes, because I think we have an after-school crisis, and I think it seems like a wonderful program, and of course, our teachers can be

739
01:34:58,373 --> 01:35:07,597
[SPEAKER_11]: you support, and I think that we could bring in more revenue to be able to support this fee that is gonna be 100,000 for six people.

740
01:35:08,637 --> 01:35:10,618
[SPEAKER_11]: I just know that as a committee, we've been asking for

741
01:35:11,377 --> 01:35:15,100
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, several years to increase numbers at our, of the three afterschool programs.

742
01:35:15,140 --> 01:35:17,201
[SPEAKER_11]: And I don't think we've increased it at all.

743
01:35:17,341 --> 01:35:26,788
[SPEAKER_11]: So that makes me concerned what it's either, we don't want to increase it at all, or we really can't, can still not hire to increase at that, those three schools.

744
01:35:27,228 --> 01:35:34,974
[SPEAKER_11]: And that would in turn, if it's the hiring piece, that is the issue, whether city is here for one, two or three years.

745
01:35:35,454 --> 01:35:39,357
[SPEAKER_11]: And I like that as a continued partnership, I just would have concerns for families just,

746
01:35:40,589 --> 01:35:48,674
[SPEAKER_11]: not having that support and creating their lives around an after-school program and then only having it for a year or maybe two.

747
01:35:48,735 --> 01:35:50,756
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's just a concern I have.

748
01:35:50,896 --> 01:35:53,157
[SPEAKER_11]: But member Branley and member Reichelt.

749
01:35:58,581 --> 01:35:59,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Member Branley, you're muted.

750
01:36:03,404 --> 01:36:04,425
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, can you hear me now?

751
01:36:05,706 --> 01:36:10,009
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think just to go along with the mayor on that, I agree.

752
01:36:10,069 --> 01:36:10,309
[SPEAKER_02]: I think

753
01:36:11,681 --> 01:36:11,961
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think.

754
01:36:11,981 --> 01:36:12,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Supplying something for a year.

755
01:36:12,882 --> 01:36:13,443
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.

756
01:36:13,763 --> 01:36:15,064
[SPEAKER_02]: But then what happens after that?

757
01:36:15,484 --> 01:36:16,025
[SPEAKER_02]: And then.

758
01:36:17,506 --> 01:36:20,149
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand what you're saying, Super, but.

759
01:36:20,889 --> 01:36:23,251
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think we needed more.

760
01:36:24,813 --> 01:36:29,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Info background info for this, because I have to agree with member on top of that.

761
01:36:35,563 --> 01:36:39,747
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to add this, I don't know, I kind of feel guilty and I think it's a great program.

762
01:36:39,787 --> 01:36:40,067
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ms.

763
01:36:40,087 --> 01:36:41,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Roberts, thank you for your time.

764
01:36:41,368 --> 01:36:46,472
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love that member Olapade could elaborate on this from a firsthand experience because it is a great program.

765
01:36:46,933 --> 01:36:54,639
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think this is something that, you know, here's a moment where, here's a great program that I would love to say, this is awesome, let's do it.

766
01:36:54,679 --> 01:36:59,123
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gonna be here for more than a year, you know, supporting our afterschool and our before school program.

767
01:36:59,844 --> 01:37:02,126
[SPEAKER_02]: But because we've dug ourselves this hole now,

768
01:37:04,580 --> 01:37:09,101
[SPEAKER_02]: it, you know, it puts us in a different kind of position.

769
01:37:09,161 --> 01:37:25,266
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and just one other thing Memogram had mentioned about the curriculum with the staff, even as paraprofessionals, we don't get any training on curriculum, we go in day in and day out, without any training.

770
01:37:26,947 --> 01:37:28,307
[SPEAKER_02]: We're, you know,

771
01:37:30,336 --> 01:37:34,359
[SPEAKER_02]: the back and call sort of of our of our classroom teacher to say, Oh, this is what we're doing today.

772
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:36,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm going to follow along.

773
01:37:36,960 --> 01:37:40,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Um and so I think even that part.

774
01:37:41,003 --> 01:37:42,304
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even a staff.

775
01:37:42,324 --> 01:37:44,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we're not trained in the things that we're doing day to day.

776
01:37:44,825 --> 01:37:52,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Um and so it's great that they can pitch in, you know, but it almost is equivalent to the parent in that point.

777
01:37:52,450 --> 01:37:54,412
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to let That

778
01:38:00,609 --> 01:38:02,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, I think these are all really valid concerns.

779
01:38:03,011 --> 01:38:07,155
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also think this is an opportunity to pilot what community partnership looks like.

780
01:38:07,835 --> 01:38:09,837
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something we should be doing.

781
01:38:09,877 --> 01:38:13,460
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a way forward in making Medford a great place to learn.

782
01:38:13,740 --> 01:38:20,066
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I can hear concerns, maybe two programs is too much for a pilot, given the uncertainties.

783
01:38:20,166 --> 01:38:21,307
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think

784
01:38:22,645 --> 01:38:34,969
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is something we can learn from, and it will lay a foundation for being able to have more partnership, more community support, training people to be in education and make a difference in students' lives.

785
01:38:35,669 --> 01:38:36,910
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a valuable pilot.

786
01:38:39,670 --> 01:38:40,691
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Member Redfeld.

787
01:38:40,771 --> 01:38:41,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham?

788
01:38:42,997 --> 01:38:43,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

789
01:38:44,098 --> 01:38:51,462
[SPEAKER_07]: Miss Roberts, I respect the fact that there's a lot of questions that we've posed that are not for you to answer.

790
01:38:51,482 --> 01:38:58,987
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's sort of always the case with these kinds of sort of big strategic efforts.

791
01:38:59,567 --> 01:39:00,387
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wondered if

792
01:39:03,055 --> 01:39:10,439
[SPEAKER_07]: we could plan to have a follow-up meeting, perhaps the week of July 8th, to be able to provide you a final answer.

793
01:39:10,459 --> 01:39:26,767
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the things that I am thinking about is that we also have, due at some point, a report back from Meghan Fidler-Carey about any ways in which the administration has come up with any expansion.

794
01:39:26,787 --> 01:39:27,668
[SPEAKER_07]: And we talked about

795
01:39:28,748 --> 01:39:31,071
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about things like using the Andrews Middle School.

796
01:39:31,631 --> 01:39:33,333
[SPEAKER_07]: We've talked about a whole bunch of things.

797
01:39:33,433 --> 01:39:48,667
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just wonder if given like if we could just get by ourselves a couple of weeks, could we put together like a cohesive plan about how this could work effectively here in our district that would be compelling?

798
01:39:49,708 --> 01:40:07,799
[SPEAKER_07]: And with the framing of it all as sort of supplementing the afterschool staff as its primary mission, which I think is sort of the thing we're all coalescing around, the revolving fund account for the afterschool program could be relied on to pay for this.

799
01:40:07,899 --> 01:40:17,065
[SPEAKER_07]: So the budget concerns that my colleagues have, which are well-founded, are separate concerns when you're talking about a revolving account.

800
01:40:17,665 --> 01:40:21,886
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just, I guess my roundabout ask is maybe twofold.

801
01:40:22,206 --> 01:40:28,347
[SPEAKER_07]: One, could we get back to you in a couple of weeks so that we can do a little bit of due diligence planning on our end?

802
01:40:28,987 --> 01:40:46,011
[SPEAKER_07]: And two, superintendent, could we schedule a meeting for the week of the eighth where we circle back, close that open loop about afterschool programming with this in mind and say, this is sort of, what does this look like as part of that solution?

803
01:40:50,197 --> 01:41:00,885
[SPEAKER_14]: We can definitely schedule a meeting during the week of the eighth, and I'll have Lisa connect with the committee regarding that.

804
01:41:01,065 --> 01:41:02,626
[SPEAKER_14]: But I defer to Ms.

805
01:41:02,666 --> 01:41:09,871
[SPEAKER_14]: Roberts because I don't know what timetable you're on with your other obligations.

806
01:41:10,171 --> 01:41:17,536
[SPEAKER_14]: So I appreciate the attention, the invitation from Medford, but I defer.

807
01:41:20,356 --> 01:41:35,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, thank you, and I just see you all know my I've been at city for two and a half years, but prior to that I was in senior administration and with Boston Public Schools, I understand the questions and the challenges and appreciate them.

808
01:41:36,726 --> 01:41:37,607
[SPEAKER_01]: On our end,

809
01:41:39,355 --> 01:41:46,278
[SPEAKER_01]: If we could have some definitive decision by the 8th, that would be helpful.

810
01:41:46,298 --> 01:41:47,299
[SPEAKER_01]: And just for a few reasons.

811
01:41:47,519 --> 01:41:56,183
[SPEAKER_01]: One, I need to decide if I'm able, if I am placing a staff person to support the schools there, I need to then plan for that.

812
01:41:56,383 --> 01:42:00,865
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are starting our training for our staff who are supporting schools in July.

813
01:42:00,925 --> 01:42:03,827
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just one thing, wanting to make sure we have someone well-trained.

814
01:42:04,547 --> 01:42:07,509
[SPEAKER_01]: Two, our AmeriCorps members are already looking for housing.

815
01:42:07,549 --> 01:42:11,271
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we do encourage them to live in the communities in which they're going to serve.

816
01:42:11,932 --> 01:42:12,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Most do.

817
01:42:13,172 --> 01:42:23,399
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as they're looking for housing to come and start with us on August 1st, that just limits their ability to find housing and plan to live closer to Medford.

818
01:42:23,839 --> 01:42:28,822
[SPEAKER_01]: We certainly don't want to encourage people to move to Medford and then they end up serving in Boston.

819
01:42:28,842 --> 01:42:31,083
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think those would be the two challenges.

820
01:42:31,283 --> 01:42:32,864
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say if you know sooner,

821
01:42:34,205 --> 01:42:39,209
[SPEAKER_01]: I would deeply appreciate knowing sooner so I can think differently.

822
01:42:39,630 --> 01:42:50,259
[SPEAKER_01]: We certainly think that Medford represents the student population is who we serve and we have been paying attention to Medford.

823
01:42:50,299 --> 01:42:53,381
[SPEAKER_01]: It's why we knocked on your door.

824
01:42:53,822 --> 01:42:56,003
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're very interested in the partnership.

825
01:42:56,804 --> 01:42:59,747
[SPEAKER_01]: We would probably need to know by the 8th just so that we can

826
01:43:01,528 --> 01:43:05,773
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll have to make some decisions on our end as well.

827
01:43:05,854 --> 01:43:18,949
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, your point about these folks needing to find housing in our housing market is a really good one, actually, because it is really hard everywhere, and Medford is not an exception to that.

828
01:43:21,112 --> 01:43:25,195
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I, I don't know, you know where the rest of the committee is at.

829
01:43:25,315 --> 01:43:38,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I think if we could, I don't know if maybe we try to approve this tonight with an expectation that some sort of report can be provided to us in the next couple of weeks that

830
01:43:39,206 --> 01:44:00,496
[SPEAKER_07]: sort of answers some of these questions that has been posed just so that we have sort of a closed loop process and then we can we can and still I think should have our meeting about broadly what happens with after school but it would sort of take that contingency out of the mix for Miss Roberts and and the staff that we would want to be here.

831
01:44:00,556 --> 01:44:02,457
[SPEAKER_07]: So I don't know if maybe that's an option where

832
01:44:03,177 --> 01:44:09,080
[SPEAKER_07]: We approve this tonight, and we still schedule that after school meeting sometime in July.

833
01:44:09,640 --> 01:44:15,083
[SPEAKER_07]: That sort of takes the timing pressure off, but allows us to sort of onboard this pilot.

834
01:44:17,244 --> 01:44:23,387
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm open to feedback on that idea, and I'm happy to make a motion, but thoughts?

835
01:44:24,687 --> 01:44:26,268
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Ruseau, you had the motion.

836
01:44:26,588 --> 01:44:30,050
[SPEAKER_11]: You were gonna put the motion, I think, forward to table, so I'll go to you.

837
01:44:30,650 --> 01:44:32,091
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I didn't get a second, thankfully.

838
01:44:33,149 --> 01:44:38,991
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, the housing point is one that's quite moving, frankly, for me.

839
01:44:39,011 --> 01:44:45,893
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, this is not gonna be money that's going to be in our budget.

840
01:44:46,354 --> 01:44:48,494
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, because our budget is being presented tonight.

841
01:44:48,614 --> 01:44:56,757
[SPEAKER_17]: So, you know, there's an assumption that we're gonna find the money in these revolving accounts, which we have all of the totals in the actual budget presentation.

842
01:44:57,197 --> 01:45:01,599
[SPEAKER_17]: Although those are the end of last fiscal year totals, not the current totals.

843
01:45:03,019 --> 01:45:18,754
[SPEAKER_17]: If Mr. McHugh believes he can find the money and if he can't find the money, if the city can perhaps provide the money out of the quote free cash, you know, that's all, you know, somebody has to write the check and it's not the school budget.

844
01:45:18,974 --> 01:45:21,877
[SPEAKER_17]: We're not cutting anybody else to do this and

845
01:45:24,165 --> 01:45:29,547
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, as member Branley pointed out, I mean, it's like, this doesn't look good.

846
01:45:29,567 --> 01:45:39,390
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember in top, I believe, I'm sorry, I forget who said it, but, you know, my concerns about union work remain.

847
01:45:40,311 --> 01:45:44,512
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not particularly pleased with the amount of money that these folks will get paid.

848
01:45:45,672 --> 01:45:49,814
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe they'll be the lowest paid workers in the district and,

849
01:45:52,186 --> 01:45:58,851
[SPEAKER_17]: But I also can't ignore the needs in the afterschool program, which is only a portion of the day.

850
01:45:58,931 --> 01:46:04,115
[SPEAKER_17]: So we've talked about that extensively, but there's the rest of the day, they have to be doing something.

851
01:46:05,116 --> 01:46:19,167
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that if we can have answers to that at a meeting in July, I would be moved to the point where I could agree to approve this, just because I do think that

852
01:46:20,359 --> 01:46:35,049
[SPEAKER_17]: If you know tonight, then folks can perhaps get into the July one hunt for a place to live rather than the August one, which is the exact same time when all of the college students in Medford are, the Tufts are all looking for housing.

853
01:46:36,389 --> 01:46:40,292
[SPEAKER_17]: So my concerns remain.

854
01:46:40,312 --> 01:46:44,695
[SPEAKER_17]: I would like us to have a meeting to discuss them, but I would be moved to a yes vote on this.

855
01:46:47,356 --> 01:46:49,378
[SPEAKER_07]: So then I will make a motion to approve

856
01:46:50,867 --> 01:47:01,050
[SPEAKER_07]: the two teams as discussed for Magdalene and Misituk, and that we'll have a summer meeting about resuming our conversation around afterschool programming.

857
01:47:03,111 --> 01:47:10,373
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, and create a plan for how to maintain those, the levels that will be implemented next year.

858
01:47:12,253 --> 01:47:16,854
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to open program, seconded by, hopefully my amendment can get in there.

859
01:47:17,755 --> 01:47:18,455
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, as amended.

860
01:47:19,471 --> 01:47:20,152
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, thank you.

861
01:47:20,612 --> 01:47:22,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by member Reinfeld.

862
01:47:22,493 --> 01:47:23,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call, please.

863
01:47:25,515 --> 01:47:26,176
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Bramley.

864
01:47:26,996 --> 01:47:27,237
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

865
01:47:28,297 --> 01:47:28,838
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Graham.

866
01:47:29,298 --> 01:47:29,538
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

867
01:47:30,219 --> 01:47:30,879
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Adepapa.

868
01:47:31,259 --> 01:47:31,740
[SPEAKER_19]: Abstain.

869
01:47:34,682 --> 01:47:35,463
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Olapade.

870
01:47:36,083 --> 01:47:36,363
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

871
01:47:37,264 --> 01:47:38,004
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Reinfeld.

872
01:47:38,325 --> 01:47:38,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

873
01:47:39,245 --> 01:47:40,846
[SPEAKER_17]: Members have yes, may I one go current.

874
01:47:41,907 --> 01:47:43,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it's in the affirmative.

875
01:47:43,708 --> 01:47:44,789
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna abstain.

876
01:47:45,290 --> 01:47:46,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

877
01:47:46,610 --> 01:47:47,011
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

878
01:47:47,051 --> 01:47:47,331
[SPEAKER_11]: Roberts.

879
01:47:47,351 --> 01:47:47,971
[SPEAKER_11]: We appreciate you being here.

880
01:47:47,991 --> 01:47:48,252
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Ms.

881
01:47:48,272 --> 01:47:48,512
[SPEAKER_11]: Roberts.

882
01:47:49,653 --> 01:47:50,974
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

883
01:47:52,114 --> 01:47:55,696
[SPEAKER_11]: Next, we have the recommendation to approve a five-year contract for a new telephone system.

884
01:47:55,716 --> 01:47:58,978
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm going to turn it over to Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent.

885
01:47:59,974 --> 01:48:01,655
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, members of the school committee.

886
01:48:02,396 --> 01:48:08,340
[SPEAKER_12]: Under state law and statute, any contract of five years needs to come before the governing body.

887
01:48:10,021 --> 01:48:14,124
[SPEAKER_12]: And our current telephone system is aging out.

888
01:48:15,225 --> 01:48:20,989
[SPEAKER_12]: It also costs more than we can get by going to the open market.

889
01:48:21,889 --> 01:48:29,175
[SPEAKER_12]: The reason why we went with Zoom is because of several reasons, but primarily we utilize them for

890
01:48:30,155 --> 01:48:33,278
[SPEAKER_12]: Hosting this meeting doing a great many other things throughout the district.

891
01:48:33,839 --> 01:48:41,486
[SPEAKER_12]: This will give us the ability for us to also consider reducing our cell phone fleet and reducing costs there as well.

892
01:48:42,027 --> 01:48:43,488
[SPEAKER_12]: We should be able to save about $25,000 a year.

893
01:48:46,591 --> 01:48:51,914
[SPEAKER_12]: And that number will come down just a little bit as we look to add phones to the high school.

894
01:48:52,474 --> 01:49:00,738
[SPEAKER_12]: I've written a grant, rather large grant, that's before the Department of Justice to add telephones to every high school classroom.

895
01:49:00,758 --> 01:49:05,021
[SPEAKER_12]: It's the only building in the district that doesn't have telephones in each classroom.

896
01:49:06,241 --> 01:49:08,182
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll be able to deploy that as well.

897
01:49:08,202 --> 01:49:08,242
[SPEAKER_12]: So

898
01:49:11,058 --> 01:49:16,922
[SPEAKER_12]: Part of the five-year agreement, they're going to provide us nearly $90,000 in an upfront credit.

899
01:49:17,203 --> 01:49:33,655
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll be able to have a professional company, Harbor Networks, come in over the summer, starting in August, deploy the new phones, remove the old phones, and get everything up and running smoothly with no impact to daily operations.

900
01:49:34,255 --> 01:49:37,617
[SPEAKER_12]: So, but once again, need the body's approval to do this.

901
01:49:37,897 --> 01:49:41,899
[SPEAKER_12]: This would also take away the $13,000 we spend annually on Zoom.

902
01:49:42,880 --> 01:49:48,943
[SPEAKER_12]: It would take away about, it would reduce our costs to about $7,500 a month.

903
01:49:49,023 --> 01:49:55,647
[SPEAKER_12]: We pay about 8,600 to $8,700 per month for current telephone service across the district.

904
01:49:56,287 --> 01:50:01,190
[SPEAKER_12]: These would be VoIP phones that are powered over internet.

905
01:50:07,517 --> 01:50:08,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

906
01:50:08,457 --> 01:50:08,798
[SPEAKER_11]: Let me just.

907
01:50:08,878 --> 01:50:09,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to approve.

908
01:50:11,099 --> 01:50:13,260
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to approve by member Graham.

909
01:50:15,260 --> 01:50:16,781
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by member Oloparde.

910
01:50:17,922 --> 01:50:18,822
[SPEAKER_11]: All those in favor?

911
01:50:21,103 --> 01:50:21,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Has to be a roll call.

912
01:50:22,084 --> 01:50:33,128
[SPEAKER_11]: Roll call, please.

913
01:50:34,029 --> 01:50:34,289
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

914
01:50:35,229 --> 01:50:35,730
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Graham?

915
01:50:36,150 --> 01:50:36,350
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

916
01:50:37,196 --> 01:50:37,797
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Ntaka?

917
01:50:38,137 --> 01:50:38,417
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

918
01:50:39,558 --> 01:50:40,279
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Olapade?

919
01:50:40,759 --> 01:50:41,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

920
01:50:41,821 --> 01:50:42,381
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Anto?

921
01:50:42,681 --> 01:50:42,922
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

922
01:50:43,442 --> 01:50:43,883
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Rossell?

923
01:50:43,903 --> 01:50:44,083
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

924
01:50:44,123 --> 01:50:44,823
[SPEAKER_16]: Mayor Landau?

925
01:50:46,545 --> 01:50:46,845
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

926
01:50:47,226 --> 01:50:48,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

927
01:50:48,707 --> 01:50:49,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion's approved.

928
01:50:50,929 --> 01:50:51,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

929
01:50:51,950 --> 01:50:53,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Dr. Cushing.

930
01:50:53,912 --> 01:50:57,656
[SPEAKER_11]: We have recommendation to approve five-year contract for a new time reporting system.

931
01:50:58,096 --> 01:51:00,779
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, Dr. Peter Cushing, assistant superintendent.

932
01:51:02,437 --> 01:51:08,061
[SPEAKER_12]: So we've been working on time clocks and time reporting and various things like that.

933
01:51:10,342 --> 01:51:15,245
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the things why I'm requesting a five-year, that's the life of the devices.

934
01:51:15,525 --> 01:51:19,067
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll get a free additional year of their replacement service.

935
01:51:19,667 --> 01:51:21,668
[SPEAKER_12]: Also negotiated $300 off per device.

936
01:51:25,210 --> 01:51:40,896
[SPEAKER_12]: device, so that's $4,500 savings, and the 1,000 time clock ID cards that can also dual roll once we start moving to electronic door locks.

937
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:42,276
[SPEAKER_12]: We won't have to worry about that.

938
01:51:42,356 --> 01:51:48,979
[SPEAKER_12]: People will already be provisioned, and they can be printed as identification badges as well with our existing system.

939
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:52,322
[SPEAKER_12]: So requesting approval of this.

940
01:51:53,403 --> 01:51:53,744
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

941
01:51:54,144 --> 01:51:55,126
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy to answer any questions.

942
01:51:56,948 --> 01:52:01,073
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you mind elaborating a little bit more on this?

943
01:52:01,273 --> 01:52:03,636
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, I missed the first sentence or two.

944
01:52:04,195 --> 01:52:04,896
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

945
01:52:05,056 --> 01:52:13,162
[SPEAKER_12]: So as we move forward with time clocks, this will directly connect into our frontline system.

946
01:52:13,302 --> 01:52:21,248
[SPEAKER_12]: It will assist with our payroll processing to make sure that our accuracy is spot on.

947
01:52:22,089 --> 01:52:26,132
[SPEAKER_12]: It will also be able to help us make sure that our overtime is accurate.

948
01:52:27,832 --> 01:52:30,673
[SPEAKER_12]: and allows for time reporting.

949
01:52:30,833 --> 01:52:50,799
[SPEAKER_12]: This will put two devices, one device at the Curtis Tufts High School, two devices in each of the other schools, one at the loading dock, one at the main office, and at the high school, one in kid's corner, one at the main security desk, and one at the loading dock as well.

950
01:52:51,399 --> 01:52:54,820
[SPEAKER_12]: The primary places where people enter the buildings.

951
01:52:56,485 --> 01:52:57,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, this is all been budgeted.

952
01:52:58,507 --> 01:52:58,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

953
01:53:00,348 --> 01:53:01,089
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, Graham?

954
01:53:03,171 --> 01:53:12,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I just wanted to say thank you to Dr Cushing because we have been having this conversation in negotiations about exactly how this will work.

955
01:53:12,999 --> 01:53:17,442
[SPEAKER_07]: And just last week, one of our bargaining partners was describing that

956
01:53:18,263 --> 01:53:21,724
[SPEAKER_07]: this exact system is what they wanted to see us implement.

957
01:53:21,804 --> 01:53:26,726
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for not being in the room, but knowing what that was and making it happen.

958
01:53:26,766 --> 01:53:28,246
[SPEAKER_07]: So appreciate that.

959
01:53:29,427 --> 01:53:35,489
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think, you know, the direct connection to frontline is critically important to streamlining

960
01:53:37,169 --> 01:53:46,951
[SPEAKER_07]: how we pay our staff, how we ensure that we're paying people for overtime in accordance with the contract and the law and all of that stuff.

961
01:53:46,991 --> 01:53:49,612
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for all of that, motion to approve.

962
01:53:50,312 --> 01:53:50,592
[SPEAKER_16]: Second.

963
01:53:51,232 --> 01:53:53,573

980
01:54:21,809 --> 01:54:23,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to take 2024 dash 30 out of order.

981
01:54:24,510 --> 01:54:24,770
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

982
01:54:24,810 --> 01:54:31,832
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham seconded by second member.

983
01:54:31,912 --> 01:54:35,093
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought that was real call, please.

984
01:54:39,085 --> 01:54:39,265
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

985
01:54:39,305 --> 01:54:39,485
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

986
01:54:39,505 --> 01:54:39,666
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

987
01:54:40,226 --> 01:54:40,526
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

988
01:54:41,988 --> 01:54:42,148
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

989
01:54:42,168 --> 01:54:42,468
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

990
01:54:42,909 --> 01:54:43,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

991
01:54:43,729 --> 01:54:43,869
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

992
01:54:43,990 --> 01:54:44,210
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

993
01:54:44,530 --> 01:54:44,790
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

994
01:54:45,251 --> 01:54:45,431
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

995
01:54:45,531 --> 01:54:45,751
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

996
01:54:46,171 --> 01:54:46,392
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

997
01:54:47,212 --> 01:54:47,413
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

998
01:54:48,133 --> 01:54:48,393
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

999
01:54:48,874 --> 01:54:49,354
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1000
01:54:49,374 --> 01:54:49,535
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1001
01:55:04,028 --> 01:55:30,654
[SPEAKER_11]: section 37 M a notwithstanding the provisions of chapter 41 or chapter 71 or any other special general law to the contrary any city or town which accepts this provision of the section may consolidate administrative functions including but not limited to financial personnel and maintenance functions of the school committee with those of the city or town provided however that such consolidation may occur only upon a majority vote of both the school committee and

1002
01:55:31,471 --> 01:55:40,398
[SPEAKER_11]: in the city, the city council with approval of the mayor required by law or in a town, the annual town meeting or in a town with no town meeting, the town council.

1003
01:55:41,158 --> 01:55:59,432
[SPEAKER_11]: B, notwithstanding any general or special law to the contrary, decision to consolidate functions pursuant to paragraph A of this section may be revoked by a majority vote of either the school committee of the city or town or the city of town or both as such vote is described in said paragraph A. I put this before you,

1004
01:56:03,160 --> 01:56:07,501
[SPEAKER_11]: is it was something that's been talked about from when I was a city councilor.

1005
01:56:07,521 --> 01:56:15,923
[SPEAKER_11]: I believe the conversation started in the 2018 timeframe and it never fully moved forward.

1006
01:56:16,003 --> 01:56:18,643
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is the way you have to accept it.

1007
01:56:18,823 --> 01:56:26,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Although, you know, I am happy to come before you with any, or I'm sure the school administration is as well with any specific requests.

1008
01:56:27,722 --> 01:56:31,963
[SPEAKER_11]: First and foremost, I think this will help a great deal with facilities.

1009
01:56:32,143 --> 01:56:39,845
[SPEAKER_11]: We want a big goal of mine, and I know it's part of the committee's goals, is to get routine maintenance in our schools.

1010
01:56:40,125 --> 01:56:43,886
[SPEAKER_11]: We hope to have more funding soon to be able to do that.

1011
01:56:44,387 --> 01:56:49,408
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this, along with all the work that the negotiation team did,

1012
01:56:49,983 --> 01:56:53,086
[SPEAKER_11]: would go a very long way and make that happen.

1013
01:56:53,146 --> 01:56:57,690
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have contracts set up and running to maintain our not-so-new schools anymore.

1014
01:56:57,710 --> 01:57:00,372
[SPEAKER_11]: So just ask for your approval on this paper.

1015
01:57:00,392 --> 01:57:09,020
[SPEAKER_11]: We will keep you up to date on anything moving forward and happy to request a vote if need be, but definitely we'll keep you updated.

1016
01:57:13,523 --> 01:57:14,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Rousseau.

1017
01:57:15,370 --> 01:57:15,830
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1018
01:57:16,191 --> 01:57:37,726
[SPEAKER_17]: As I understand this statute, this will simply mean that you all can start having conversations about doing this work, that absolutely no sharing of resources occurs when we agree to this, that if we want to share any resources, those individual decisions will come to the school committee and the city council, and we will vote whether we agree or not.

1019
01:57:37,926 --> 01:57:38,426
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that correct?

1020
01:57:45,814 --> 01:57:52,741
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I understood it that once you accept this, it can be done, but it would have to come before the school committee for any type of budgetary vote.

1021
01:57:52,962 --> 01:57:57,566
[SPEAKER_11]: So if this money is coming out of school monies, then yes, you'd have to vote for it.

1022
01:57:57,626 --> 01:58:04,714
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure the city council would as well, unless it was coming out of city funding, then yes, it would have to be part of a budget or a supplemental budget.

1023
01:58:05,578 --> 01:58:06,218
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not understanding.

1024
01:58:06,258 --> 01:58:32,715
[SPEAKER_17]: So you're suggesting that this paper allows the superintendent and the city to get together and decide that maintenance will now be a city function, that utilities won't be charged to the schools anymore, we'll just have them charged out of the schools, that we'll move any of the functionalities, information systems, IT department, those that you and who else gets to decide that that is now just a city function?

1025
01:58:34,710 --> 01:58:37,973
[SPEAKER_11]: I would expect tomorrow night that I would hope that they would approve this.

1026
01:58:38,054 --> 01:58:43,399
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would expect to be paper that it would just be for facilities for now.

1027
01:58:43,499 --> 01:58:46,863
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we'd have to go before and this body can do the same.

1028
01:58:46,883 --> 01:58:50,907
[SPEAKER_11]: And then if we wanna expand that, we can always take another vote.

1029
01:58:51,886 --> 01:58:57,610
[SPEAKER_17]: So facilities being the obvious one, and you've mentioned it, and I think everybody assumes that that's what we were talking about.

1030
01:58:58,751 --> 01:59:05,475
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we approve this, that means the school committee no longer has oversight of facilities, as is the case in Somerville.

1031
01:59:06,836 --> 01:59:20,485
[SPEAKER_17]: During the pandemic, the school committee lived through hell because they did not open, the city did not open the schools because the schools were 100%, facilities-wise, were a part of the city of Somerville, and that is still the case today.

1032
01:59:22,646 --> 01:59:34,893
[SPEAKER_17]: If we have any maintenance challenges, the rational thing for the community to do is to bring up the school committee, at which point we will say, sorry, not our job, call City Hall.

1033
01:59:37,234 --> 01:59:41,296
[SPEAKER_17]: And I just want that to be clear that that's the situation we'll be in.

1034
01:59:41,316 --> 01:59:43,357
[SPEAKER_17]: And if we are unsatisfied with

1035
01:59:44,622 --> 01:59:49,446
[SPEAKER_17]: how the city is doing the maintenance in our buildings, which I have no reason to believe that's the case, that would happen.

1036
01:59:49,886 --> 02:00:01,996
[SPEAKER_17]: But if that happens, our only option would be to sever, to end this entirely, abruptly, just decide that no longer the city has any responsibility for facilities.

1037
02:00:02,096 --> 02:00:03,657
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that how you understand this?

1038
02:00:05,258 --> 02:00:07,780
[SPEAKER_11]: That may be how some cities and towns handle it.

1039
02:00:08,221 --> 02:00:11,743
[SPEAKER_11]: I do not see that it would operate that way.

1040
02:00:11,964 --> 02:00:13,485
[SPEAKER_11]: So for example, if you were gonna put

1041
02:00:14,085 --> 02:00:22,890
[SPEAKER_11]: IT under one director fully, and then if you're going to say, yeah, do it with IT, I could see that being the case.

1042
02:00:23,091 --> 02:00:35,698
[SPEAKER_11]: But where we have a facilities maintenance director in the schools, we would just be putting somebody in charge to oversee, to help guide, to put the appropriate contracts into place, to help create a system and help

1043
02:00:39,099 --> 02:00:47,245
[SPEAKER_11]: train and get that job done, especially if we're going to have an influx of potential monies that we want to be spent towards maintaining our schools.

1044
02:00:47,605 --> 02:00:49,246
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a lot for one person to handle.

1045
02:00:49,847 --> 02:00:54,850
[SPEAKER_11]: And that person also oversees all the custodial work, from what I understand.

1046
02:00:54,890 --> 02:00:58,733
[SPEAKER_11]: So I feel like this would be an extra support and another level.

1047
02:00:59,794 --> 02:01:00,915
[SPEAKER_11]: So I see it a little bit differently.

1048
02:01:01,435 --> 02:01:01,615
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

1049
02:01:01,675 --> 02:01:07,980
[SPEAKER_17]: And my last question is, so this person will not report to the superintendent or has supervision within the school system, correct?

1050
02:01:10,018 --> 02:01:28,552
[SPEAKER_17]: If our director of facilities was reporting to the director of DPW or whoever it would be, director of facilities at the city, that person would be doing their review, the contractor would be a mayor, signs the contract, not the school committee or the superintendent.

1051
02:01:32,175 --> 02:01:34,417
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, in this one case, I would,

1052
02:01:35,609 --> 02:01:40,494
[SPEAKER_11]: see that this director of facilities would still be a direct report to the superintendent.

1053
02:01:41,876 --> 02:01:47,081
[SPEAKER_11]: If there's somebody overseeing that work, that could also be a second direct report.

1054
02:01:49,464 --> 02:01:50,745
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you.

1055
02:01:51,666 --> 02:01:52,107
[SPEAKER_11]: Member Graham.

1056
02:01:53,936 --> 02:02:01,438
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, and I sort of am feeling like, so two things.

1057
02:02:01,819 --> 02:02:11,362
[SPEAKER_07]: One is I'm in favor of having these discussions because I think to your point about the opportunities that having some additional support might provide is good.

1058
02:02:11,962 --> 02:02:22,085
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm sort of inclined to say what I'd like to see us do is adopt the statute, which we have to do in order for any of this to be legally possible.

1059
02:02:23,185 --> 02:02:38,172
[SPEAKER_07]: but also adopt the statute with an amendment that states that before any sort of change happens, that that plan will be presented to us for review and approval.

1060
02:02:38,812 --> 02:02:47,334
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason I say that is because there's any number of ways where this, like, I think we've just talked about like five of them literally in a minute, that this could happen.

1061
02:02:47,374 --> 02:02:54,356
[SPEAKER_07]: It could just simply be support and then everybody still reports to the superintendent and the school committee still holds the contracts.

1062
02:02:54,856 --> 02:02:57,377
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be that the contracts go somewhere else.

1063
02:02:57,437 --> 02:03:00,618
[SPEAKER_07]: It could, you know, any number of things could happen in any of these departments.

1064
02:03:00,678 --> 02:03:04,479
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I would like to see is that, you know,

1065
02:03:05,484 --> 02:03:14,927
[SPEAKER_07]: we agree that we should investigate what these options are and bring those proposals back to this group before those actions are taken.

1066
02:03:14,947 --> 02:03:18,088
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's absolutely fine.

1067
02:03:18,609 --> 02:03:20,009
[SPEAKER_11]: It just has to be a B paper.

1068
02:03:20,169 --> 02:03:25,771
[SPEAKER_11]: From what I understand, this language has to be adopted as is, but you can absolutely do a B paper to make those restrictions.

1069
02:03:27,401 --> 02:03:29,642
[SPEAKER_07]: So we don't usually do B papers.

1070
02:03:30,603 --> 02:03:36,745
[SPEAKER_07]: So do I make a motion to like approve the paper and then somebody else adds a B paper?

1071
02:03:36,785 --> 02:03:37,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that how it happens?

1072
02:03:38,646 --> 02:03:39,186
[SPEAKER_07]: You could do both.

1073
02:03:39,227 --> 02:03:39,767
[SPEAKER_07]: You could do both.

1074
02:03:39,867 --> 02:03:40,047
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1075
02:03:40,567 --> 02:03:45,429
[SPEAKER_05]: So versus tabling the motion versus tabling this until we see that plan.

1076
02:03:47,450 --> 02:03:51,072
[SPEAKER_07]: What I'm saying is we would be accepting the statute

1077
02:03:52,681 --> 02:03:57,725
[SPEAKER_07]: So we would make a motion to accept the statute, which has to happen in order for the statute to be accepted.

1078
02:03:58,285 --> 02:04:07,932
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there would be a B paper added that is a motion that requires school committee approval before any plan is implemented for shared resources.

1079
02:04:09,293 --> 02:04:14,257
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we would be doing tonight would simply be opening the door to have that discussion.

1080
02:04:15,916 --> 02:04:26,285
[SPEAKER_11]: and that would allow us to know this, in general, this is supported, especially with, say, facilities, and allow us to build that plan to bring to the school committee for approval or denial.

1081
02:04:30,788 --> 02:04:32,250
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau, do you need me to repeat that?

1082
02:04:32,270 --> 02:04:36,353
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll let me tell you what I wrote down.

1083
02:04:36,373 --> 02:04:43,199
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to approve 2024-30 and require school committee approval for any plan before sharing resources.

1084
02:04:45,247 --> 02:04:45,387
[SPEAKER_07]: motion.

1085
02:04:45,407 --> 02:04:48,428
[SPEAKER_07]: Two motions of main paper and then the B paper.

1086
02:04:50,709 --> 02:04:50,909
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1087
02:04:52,109 --> 02:04:52,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1088
02:04:52,369 --> 02:04:58,772
[SPEAKER_11]: That's my motion motion for approval of the main paper and B paper by member Graham.

1089
02:04:59,992 --> 02:05:01,633
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll do the main paper first.

1090
02:05:02,073 --> 02:05:02,673
[SPEAKER_11]: Is there a second?

1091
02:05:04,193 --> 02:05:04,614
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll second.

[SPEAKER_11]: And second is the B paper to bring a plan of action to the committee before anything is implemented by Member Graham, seconded by?

1143
02:06:49,046 --> 02:06:49,927
[SPEAKER_11]: I do.

1144
02:06:50,347 --> 02:06:53,228
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm gonna abstain and not take part in this discussion.

1145
02:06:54,388 --> 02:06:54,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1146
02:06:54,708 --> 02:06:57,389
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

1147
02:06:57,549 --> 02:07:00,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, full disclosure, yeah, my sister's a teacher in the Metropolitan Schools.

1148
02:07:01,791 --> 02:07:02,091
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1149
02:07:02,511 --> 02:07:03,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so thank you.

1150
02:07:03,951 --> 02:07:04,992
[SPEAKER_02]: I also make a motion.

1151
02:07:07,553 --> 02:07:08,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on one second.

1152
02:07:08,797 --> 02:07:09,357
[SPEAKER_02]: You tell me when.

1153
02:07:09,377 --> 02:07:11,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1154
02:07:12,258 --> 02:07:19,001
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a recommendation to approve the FY 25 Medford Public Schools operating budget by Mr. Jerry McHugh, Director of Finance.

1155
02:07:19,041 --> 02:07:21,902
[SPEAKER_07]: So the mayor is abstaining from this vote entirely.

1156
02:07:21,922 --> 02:07:27,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Branley, did you have a conflict you want to cite so that we know what we need to do?

1157
02:07:28,044 --> 02:07:28,445
[SPEAKER_02]: correct.

1158
02:07:28,565 --> 02:07:30,386
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need to make a motion to amend.

1159
02:07:30,406 --> 02:07:41,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to sever the teacher salary line item as my sister is also a teacher here in the district, but I can abstain from that part of the vote, but I can vote on the total budget.

1160
02:07:41,856 --> 02:07:42,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, perfect.

1161
02:07:42,877 --> 02:07:45,539
[SPEAKER_07]: When the time comes, we will, um, take that up.

1162
02:07:46,200 --> 02:07:48,302
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you, Mr. McHugh.

1163
02:07:49,002 --> 02:07:49,663
[SPEAKER_07]: The floor is yours.

1164
02:07:51,064 --> 02:07:52,385
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, well, thank you.

1165
02:07:52,705 --> 02:07:54,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and vice chair, the

1166
02:07:58,055 --> 02:08:02,998
[SPEAKER_13]: You hopefully have a copy of the budget that got delivered.

1167
02:08:05,799 --> 02:08:15,085
[SPEAKER_13]: I attempted to kind of recap the bit of a roller coaster ride that the budget was during the year.

1168
02:08:20,546 --> 02:08:32,930
[SPEAKER_13]: like to thank the staff here and the school committee for their advocacy and of course the mayor and the city council for adopting the budget that they did.

1169
02:08:33,730 --> 02:08:44,633
[SPEAKER_13]: But essentially the superintendent's recommendation was a budget of about 76 million with $2.2 million worth of cuts.

1170
02:08:47,745 --> 02:08:51,628
[SPEAKER_13]: The school committee adopted a budget with zero cuts.

1171
02:08:53,990 --> 02:08:57,413
[SPEAKER_13]: We did receive additional money.

1172
02:08:58,874 --> 02:09:08,483
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess I should say, in addition to the savings plan that we proposed at the time of the public hearing, it was still this,

1173
02:09:12,825 --> 02:09:21,612
[SPEAKER_13]: over $5 million worth of additional savings that we would have to come up with in the absence of any additional money.

1174
02:09:21,712 --> 02:09:27,056
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was a big piece of what the city council funded.

1175
02:09:27,076 --> 02:09:36,464
[SPEAKER_13]: They also gave sufficient money for us to kind of reduce that savings plan from 2.2 million to about 1.6.

1176
02:09:40,051 --> 02:10:04,163
[SPEAKER_13]: That allowed us to bring back positions that we previously identified as being cuts to high school teachers, to elementary teachers, for administrators and a nurse back in the budget, along with

1177
02:10:05,191 --> 02:10:11,793
[SPEAKER_13]: some positions that we were not going to try to fund from the ESSA program.

1178
02:10:12,673 --> 02:10:20,036
[SPEAKER_13]: And those additional positions were two literacy coaches and three para-behavior specialists.

1179
02:10:20,696 --> 02:10:24,177
[SPEAKER_13]: So those positions are now back in the budget.

1180
02:10:24,197 --> 02:10:28,018
[SPEAKER_13]: The contracts, fully funded.

1181
02:10:28,038 --> 02:10:33,000
[SPEAKER_13]: The chronically underfunded accounts, fully funded.

1182
02:10:34,170 --> 02:10:47,956
[SPEAKER_13]: all the ESSA positions that we had proposed that were essential to some vital programs that we run here in Medford Public Schools.

1183
02:10:48,036 --> 02:11:00,281
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are in the budget along with some new spending, some of which is required and some was proposed as

1184
02:11:02,908 --> 02:11:09,051
[SPEAKER_13]: more discretionary but necessary in the operations of Medford Public Schools.

1185
02:11:11,052 --> 02:11:28,700
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I was gonna spare you another PowerPoint presentation and just kind of open it up to questions that you might have before we take the vote.

1186
02:11:31,394 --> 02:11:32,316
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. McHugh.

1187
02:11:33,358 --> 02:11:35,281
[SPEAKER_07]: For the committee, are there any questions?

1188
02:11:38,427 --> 02:11:40,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Lapate and then member Intoppa.

1189
02:11:41,570 --> 02:11:53,375
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so just a couple quick, you know, just line items that I'm sure will be explained very, I know that the most important thing for I think the committee understand that I'm sure we all do is that just the costs of living have gone up.

1190
02:11:53,435 --> 02:11:56,037
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the ways that we need to pay for things have gone up as well.

1191
02:11:56,997 --> 02:12:00,799
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, when we're looking at the special education line item, you know, there's an increase.

1192
02:12:02,253 --> 02:12:10,120
[SPEAKER_00]: I can just find it right here that goes up from the 2023 2024 from 15 million to upwards of 19.5 million.

1193
02:12:10,180 --> 02:12:21,070
[SPEAKER_00]: So just things like that where there are those really noticeable increases, I'm assuming it's just because of cost more than any other flagship programming that we're doing or any major differences in the district.

1194
02:12:21,151 --> 02:12:24,754
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's untrue, that might be really good for us to have some more

1195
02:12:26,215 --> 02:12:36,707
[SPEAKER_00]: direct explanation from the administration about how those programs might be costing us, but if it's just increased because of cost of living, then that's something that I don't necessarily need more clarification on.

1196
02:12:38,048 --> 02:12:40,271
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I'd say that there's two things.

1197
02:12:40,571 --> 02:12:45,297
[SPEAKER_13]: Cost did increase, and part of our new spending proposal was

1198
02:12:47,970 --> 02:13:01,254
[SPEAKER_13]: The fact that the state had granted tuition adjustments for all out of district placements, I think it was 4.69%.

1199
02:13:02,014 --> 02:13:14,297
[SPEAKER_13]: And then there's just kind of growth in the program, even though I think Medford does a pretty good job of offering a lot of opportunity for special needs students in district.

1200
02:13:15,663 --> 02:13:18,684
[SPEAKER_13]: that you do have some growth.

1201
02:13:18,744 --> 02:13:36,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Oftentimes, students will be placed in a collaborative or least restrictive setting, and if it's not working out, they have to go into a setting that might have more therapeutic options for that student.

1202
02:13:36,169 --> 02:13:41,450
[SPEAKER_13]: So that kind of adds cost, and that's where the growth comes in.

1203
02:13:42,833 --> 02:14:09,144
[SPEAKER_13]: The other thing, and this was just, I guess, a difference of how to present the budget, but all of our adjustment counselors, of which we have a substantial amount, were, even though they were charged to the special education budget, they were presented in the budget last year as part of the guidance budget.

1204
02:14:10,154 --> 02:14:17,896
[SPEAKER_13]: because I guess because the director of guidance provides the supervision for those adjustment counselors.

1205
02:14:18,957 --> 02:14:29,600
[SPEAKER_13]: So those adjustment counselors, I think, so you'll be able to make sense of a budget to actual report.

1206
02:14:30,618 --> 02:14:38,040
[SPEAKER_13]: those adjustment counselors are budgeted in the special ed program in FY25.

1207
02:14:38,740 --> 02:14:52,042
[SPEAKER_13]: And you probably noticed that the guidance program, which is program 19, I think, that probably went down because of that shift.

1208
02:14:55,143 --> 02:14:55,383
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1209
02:15:03,294 --> 02:15:05,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, number and tapa you're good.

1210
02:15:05,436 --> 02:15:06,737
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you vice chair.

1211
02:15:06,777 --> 02:15:08,058
[SPEAKER_19]: Graham Jerry.

1212
02:15:08,138 --> 02:15:15,163
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to take a moment and make a few thank yous 1 for creating this detailed report and giving a history lesson.

1213
02:15:15,224 --> 02:15:19,267
[SPEAKER_19]: So that someone who missed everything and may have been like, wait, what happened?

1214
02:15:19,307 --> 02:15:20,147
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know.

1215
02:15:20,928 --> 02:15:25,411
[SPEAKER_19]: This tells the story of what happened and sort of what's been going on.

1216
02:15:26,412 --> 02:15:27,893
[SPEAKER_19]: So I really want to thank you.

1217
02:15:27,913 --> 02:15:31,916
[SPEAKER_19]: I was actually talking to someone the other day about transparency and with budgeting.

1218
02:15:31,936 --> 02:15:33,177
[SPEAKER_19]: And they were like, well, is it going up?

1219
02:15:33,237 --> 02:15:34,138
[SPEAKER_19]: Is transparency going down?

1220
02:15:34,158 --> 02:15:37,781
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm like, it seems like it's going up with the packet I just received.

1221
02:15:37,941 --> 02:15:39,342
[SPEAKER_19]: We're getting all this information.

1222
02:15:39,422 --> 02:15:42,404
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's conversations on record, all these things.

1223
02:15:42,424 --> 02:15:43,165
[SPEAKER_19]: So just thank you.

1224
02:15:43,705 --> 02:15:45,067
[SPEAKER_19]: And to also hear that.

1225
02:15:45,107 --> 02:15:45,767
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1226
02:15:45,947 --> 02:15:46,608
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, of course.

1227
02:15:46,888 --> 02:15:48,569
[SPEAKER_19]: I also want to say, as I

1228
02:15:49,963 --> 02:15:54,886
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't want to sound nonchalant when I talk about cuts, but I do want to acknowledge that these are people's lives and positions.

1229
02:15:54,926 --> 02:15:58,647
[SPEAKER_19]: So I don't want it to seem so casual when I, when we discuss this.

1230
02:15:59,448 --> 02:16:04,390
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, so I want to acknowledge that and all the people who made their voices heard, but Jerry, just a quick question.

1231
02:16:04,450 --> 02:16:11,874
[SPEAKER_19]: So in here with page 13, it talks about adding back positions that were cut.

1232
02:16:11,894 --> 02:16:11,934
[SPEAKER_19]: Um,

1233
02:16:18,283 --> 02:16:20,464
[SPEAKER_19]: So the, and maybe I just misread.

1234
02:16:20,544 --> 02:16:22,464
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is why, this is why we asked the questions.

1235
02:16:23,325 --> 02:16:32,607
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, so the performing arts director, the assistant director of athletics, are those all positions now funded through the budget because they're not listed here anymore?

1236
02:16:32,627 --> 02:16:41,450
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, the four administrators that were, uh, brought back into the budget were the, um,

1237
02:16:42,142 --> 02:17:03,777
[SPEAKER_13]: coordinator of world language, the assistant athletic director, and director of health and PE, the library media director, and a special education coordinator.

1238
02:17:05,737 --> 02:17:09,800
[SPEAKER_19]: So the director of performing arts is still is still out.

1239
02:17:10,180 --> 02:17:10,320
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1240
02:17:10,360 --> 02:17:10,901
[SPEAKER_19]: Understood.

1241
02:17:10,921 --> 02:17:13,123
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1242
02:17:13,183 --> 02:17:19,767
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, just wanted to double check because as much as I just talked about transparency, that just wasn't clear and wanted to double check with that.

1243
02:17:19,787 --> 02:17:25,892
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I think at this moment, that's all I have, but if another question arise, I will let it be.

1244
02:17:25,972 --> 02:17:26,272
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1245
02:17:26,773 --> 02:17:27,093
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1246
02:17:27,533 --> 02:17:31,276
[SPEAKER_13]: And certainly feel free to email, um, if it comes up later.

1247
02:17:31,756 --> 02:17:32,477
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds good.

1248
02:17:33,820 --> 02:17:37,823
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you, Member Intoppa, and I think that's an important clarification.

1249
02:17:38,944 --> 02:17:52,475
[SPEAKER_07]: My understanding, though, is that for the administrators unit, one of the positions that was cut, that individual actually has accepted another position in the district, so she is remaining with the district.

1250
02:17:53,455 --> 02:18:03,020
[SPEAKER_07]: And then my understanding of the performing arts position is that the individual in that role has resigned, so the position is open.

1251
02:18:04,081 --> 02:18:06,262
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I would like somebody, maybe Ms.

1252
02:18:06,302 --> 02:18:17,708
[SPEAKER_07]: Glucy, Dr. Glucy, to describe the vision for supporting performing arts under this new structure if this budget passes.

1253
02:18:19,549 --> 02:18:20,469
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, absolutely.

1254
02:18:23,040 --> 02:18:27,942
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for for updating the things that are kind of rolling as we go.

1255
02:18:29,482 --> 02:18:35,864
[SPEAKER_09]: So because the that position that person has left the district.

1256
02:18:37,265 --> 02:18:41,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now we have Suzanne fee who is the director of fine arts.

1257
02:18:42,047 --> 02:18:43,107
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we would be.

1258
02:18:43,669 --> 02:18:45,970
[SPEAKER_09]: consolidating the two departments.

1259
02:18:46,230 --> 02:18:53,872
[SPEAKER_09]: And so Suzanne Fee will also be running both the performing arts and the fine arts departments.

1260
02:18:54,572 --> 02:19:03,655
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's important to note that that is the way institutionally Medford has done the arts departments.

1261
02:19:04,095 --> 02:19:05,796
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only been for two years that we

1262
02:19:06,843 --> 02:19:10,967
[SPEAKER_09]: created coordinator positions where we kind of separated the fine arts from performing arts.

1263
02:19:11,807 --> 02:19:28,862
[SPEAKER_09]: And so in order to kind of have more of a district wide view for the arts program, cause there is a lot of overlap and Suzanne currently also has a nice relationship with the performing arts.

1264
02:19:30,002 --> 02:19:33,986
[SPEAKER_09]: We would be merging the two so that she would be in charge of both departments.

1265
02:19:34,970 --> 02:19:44,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I know that the superintendent, uh, Suzanne fee and I plan on having conversations this week and throughout the summer, um, with.

1266
02:19:45,493 --> 02:20:01,057
[SPEAKER_09]: Teachers within the music department, as well as parents, um, that are affiliated with clubs through the performing arts department so that we can have, we can answer some questions and have just some discussions on where we go from here.

1267
02:20:03,274 --> 02:20:04,154
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that's helpful.

1268
02:20:04,835 --> 02:20:05,275
[SPEAKER_07]: That is.

1269
02:20:05,855 --> 02:20:10,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Will this be a promotion for Ms.

1270
02:20:10,157 --> 02:20:18,620
[SPEAKER_07]: Fee with taking on the extra department or does this all fall under her current director one job description?

1271
02:20:18,640 --> 02:20:25,782
[SPEAKER_14]: It would still qualify under director one.

1272
02:20:26,803 --> 02:20:28,624
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you for that clarification.

1273
02:20:30,484 --> 02:20:32,025
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, member Reinfeld.

1274
02:20:32,816 --> 02:20:41,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, thank you, Mr. McHugh and everybody who contributed conversations both within the administration and within the community.

1275
02:20:41,603 --> 02:20:45,906
[SPEAKER_05]: These were not easy conversations, and I appreciate the clarity of the story.

1276
02:20:46,026 --> 02:20:57,755
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing that this story doesn't tell that I think it's important to say on the floor in this meeting is that this whole process has revealed a lot of important conversations that need to happen.

1277
02:20:59,096 --> 02:21:13,923
[SPEAKER_05]: It has the potential cuts from the initial budget proposal have revealed the challenges in the high school schedule, the middle school schedule, the enrollment and distribution of students across the schools, particularly the elementary schools.

1278
02:21:14,603 --> 02:21:24,648
[SPEAKER_05]: It's raised questions about the stipend rates and then the timing of the budget cycle itself and how it coincides with non-renewals and everything.

1279
02:21:24,748 --> 02:21:26,449
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that is really important

1280
02:21:26,989 --> 02:21:27,770
[SPEAKER_05]: to keep in mind.

1281
02:21:28,370 --> 02:21:31,832
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not immediately germane to the approval of the budget at hand.

1282
02:21:33,493 --> 02:21:53,447
[SPEAKER_05]: But the one thing that I would like to do, I would like to make a motion that the school committee receive a report by December 7th describing the implementation and impact of the position reductions that were not related to enrollment, just to understand how the intended and unintended consequences of the decisions are going to affect next year's budget request.

1283
02:21:53,807 --> 02:21:56,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Because what I hate seeing in budgeting is when

1284
02:21:57,249 --> 02:22:09,278
[SPEAKER_05]: a position goes away, and I will say I'm particularly concerned about some of the middle school positions, but when it goes away and then we never go back to say, how did that pan out?

1285
02:22:09,718 --> 02:22:12,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Things just disappear and fall off the budget.

1286
02:22:12,420 --> 02:22:19,866
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would like to see a report to inform the next budget cycle of how those impacts affected.

1287
02:22:21,790 --> 02:22:37,167
[SPEAKER_07]: So a motion to receive a report by December 7th that specifically accounts for what has transpired, where any position reductions are maintained in this budget.

1288
02:22:37,187 --> 02:22:38,628
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that correct?

1289
02:22:39,849 --> 02:22:40,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1290
02:22:41,031 --> 02:23:00,015
[SPEAKER_05]: So I had phrased it, the report describing the implementation and impact of position reductions between the previous and current year budgets to understand the unintended and the intended, sorry, the intended and unintended consequences of these decisions will affect the budget request for the upcoming fiscal year.

1291
02:23:00,035 --> 02:23:01,476
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to send that to someone.

1292
02:23:02,316 --> 02:23:02,816
[SPEAKER_16]: Send it to me.

1293
02:23:02,916 --> 02:23:04,276
[SPEAKER_07]: You could send it to Member Rousseau.

1294
02:23:04,296 --> 02:23:05,336
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a motion on the floor.

1295
02:23:05,356 --> 02:23:06,957
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Reinfeld, is there a second?

1296
02:23:06,977 --> 02:23:08,037
[SPEAKER_16]: Second.

1297
02:23:09,082 --> 02:23:10,603
[SPEAKER_07]: second by Member Rousseau.

1298
02:23:12,804 --> 02:23:16,266
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's sort of pause game and take this motion.

1299
02:23:17,586 --> 02:23:21,568
[SPEAKER_07]: I tell that to my kids when I want them to do the laundry or really anything else in life.

1300
02:23:21,628 --> 02:23:34,315
[SPEAKER_07]: So on the motion by Member Reinfeld, which was seconded by Member Rousseau to receive a report by December 7th about these position reductions and the implementation, Member Rousseau, can you please call the roll?

1301
02:23:35,676 --> 02:23:35,956
[SPEAKER_16]: Sure.

1302
02:23:36,656 --> 02:23:37,277
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Bramley.

1303
02:23:37,817 --> 02:23:38,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1304
02:23:38,783 --> 02:23:39,283
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember Graham?

1305
02:23:39,864 --> 02:23:40,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1306
02:23:40,564 --> 02:23:41,285
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember Intoppa?

1307
02:23:41,525 --> 02:23:41,826
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1308
02:23:42,446 --> 02:23:43,227
[SPEAKER_16]: Remember Olapade?

1309
02:23:43,647 --> 02:23:43,867
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1310
02:23:44,448 --> 02:23:45,128
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember Reinfeld?

1311
02:23:45,449 --> 02:23:45,709
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1312
02:23:46,429 --> 02:23:49,532
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember Rousseau, and the mayor is absent?

1313
02:23:52,835 --> 02:23:53,855
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I believe so.

1314
02:23:56,858 --> 02:23:59,660
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just looking, yes, you can mark her absent.

1315
02:23:59,680 --> 02:24:01,622
[SPEAKER_07]: So,

1316
02:24:04,178 --> 02:24:06,680
[SPEAKER_07]: Five in the affirmative, one absent.

1317
02:24:07,020 --> 02:24:09,181
[SPEAKER_07]: No, six in the affirmative, one absent, sorry.

1318
02:24:10,482 --> 02:24:11,363
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion is approved.

1319
02:24:12,984 --> 02:24:14,285
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau, you had your hand in the air.

1320
02:24:15,045 --> 02:24:16,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, Member Reinfeld, are you done with your questions?

1321
02:24:18,347 --> 02:24:19,668
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all I have to say for now, yes.

1322
02:24:20,229 --> 02:24:20,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, thank you.

1323
02:24:21,370 --> 02:24:21,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Ruseau.

1324
02:24:22,449 --> 02:24:22,829
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1325
02:24:24,190 --> 02:24:25,390
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to just quickly go through.

1326
02:24:26,711 --> 02:24:27,631
[SPEAKER_17]: I had a lot of questions.

1327
02:24:27,711 --> 02:24:28,751
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm trying to keep them brief.

1328
02:24:29,832 --> 02:24:39,635
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to comment that in the message from the superintendent on the third paragraph, it does say that we've fully funding programs and positions formally funded with our ETRA grant.

1329
02:24:39,675 --> 02:24:42,977
[SPEAKER_17]: And I believe there are still a couple that we did not continue.

1330
02:24:42,997 --> 02:24:45,237
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that correct?

1331
02:24:45,257 --> 02:24:45,918
[SPEAKER_13]: That is true.

1332
02:24:46,198 --> 02:24:46,778
[SPEAKER_13]: That is true.

1333
02:24:46,838 --> 02:24:48,559
[SPEAKER_13]: That's poor,

1334
02:24:51,052 --> 02:24:54,173
[SPEAKER_13]: That's almost, I should have said almost fully fine.

1335
02:24:54,694 --> 02:24:55,074
[SPEAKER_17]: That's fine.

1336
02:24:55,154 --> 02:24:56,034
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanted to be sure.

1337
02:24:56,254 --> 02:24:57,035
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1338
02:24:58,916 --> 02:25:04,678
[SPEAKER_17]: And thankfully I put tabs, which this is a lot easier in person to do this stuff.

1339
02:25:07,791 --> 02:25:11,794
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanted to comment on page seven under federal grants.

1340
02:25:12,215 --> 02:25:16,278
[SPEAKER_17]: I see this sentence in here, which made me very happy and I just wanted to thank you.

1341
02:25:16,338 --> 02:25:23,764
[SPEAKER_17]: It says, when these grants are received during the course of the fiscal year, the actual grant amount received will be presented to the school committee for acceptance.

1342
02:25:23,884 --> 02:25:25,685
[SPEAKER_17]: I am very thankful for that.

1343
02:25:25,745 --> 02:25:33,972
[SPEAKER_17]: We have not done that in the past and it doesn't change anything financially, but it does keep us more informed about what's coming in, where it's going.

1344
02:25:34,432 --> 02:25:37,793
[SPEAKER_13]: So I want to thank you for including- It's actually a statutory requirement.

1345
02:25:38,373 --> 02:25:41,614
[SPEAKER_17]: There's that.

1346
02:25:42,254 --> 02:25:43,154
[SPEAKER_17]: There's that, right?

1347
02:25:43,214 --> 02:25:45,155
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't mean to shush you on that.

1348
02:25:45,335 --> 02:25:46,575
[SPEAKER_17]: I came across wrong.

1349
02:25:46,595 --> 02:25:47,535
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1350
02:25:48,095 --> 02:25:51,216
[SPEAKER_17]: On page nine, the Bedford Family Network, there's a negative balance of $70,000.

1351
02:25:51,316 --> 02:25:51,516
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1352
02:25:51,536 --> 02:25:52,677
[SPEAKER_17]: Quite surprising and wondering

1353
02:25:58,983 --> 02:26:01,225
[SPEAKER_17]: Where does the money come from that goes in there?

1354
02:26:01,425 --> 02:26:05,107
[SPEAKER_17]: And how are we operating the Family Network?

1355
02:26:06,168 --> 02:26:10,211
[SPEAKER_13]: Over the summer, I think we have to just unpack that.

1356
02:26:10,271 --> 02:26:14,894
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's possible what we think is happening is that

1357
02:26:17,742 --> 02:26:29,606
[SPEAKER_13]: people are being charged too much to that account and not enough to other accounts that are part of the Medford Family Network funding stream.

1358
02:26:30,506 --> 02:26:40,070
[SPEAKER_13]: So there is a person that oversees those budgets and she's confident that they're spending accurately.

1359
02:26:40,630 --> 02:26:46,312
[SPEAKER_13]: The initial amount I got was from the city.

1360
02:26:47,737 --> 02:26:55,002
[SPEAKER_13]: at the beginning of the fiscal year, too, which, you know, so we started out with that balance.

1361
02:26:55,082 --> 02:27:00,286
[SPEAKER_13]: But anyway, that's something that's on the agenda to get to the bottom of.

1362
02:27:00,866 --> 02:27:01,547
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you.

1363
02:27:02,267 --> 02:27:06,610
[SPEAKER_17]: On page 11, under the funding summary, the

1364
02:27:08,621 --> 02:27:15,206
[SPEAKER_17]: Last sentence of the first paragraph says with this in mind, the superintendent submitted a budget recommendation of 76.6 million.

1365
02:27:16,207 --> 02:27:20,130
[SPEAKER_17]: And then it says increasing the base budget by 8.2 million.

1366
02:27:20,550 --> 02:27:24,774
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think that is the 8.2 million.

1367
02:27:26,355 --> 02:27:28,236
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know where you get that from 71.2 to go up to 76 and get 8.2.

1368
02:27:28,356 --> 02:27:30,198
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, the 76 included the $2.2 million savings plan.

1369
02:27:38,120 --> 02:27:38,460
[SPEAKER_17]: Got it.

1370
02:27:38,740 --> 02:27:39,181
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1371
02:27:39,301 --> 02:27:40,781
[SPEAKER_17]: That makes sense.

1372
02:27:45,223 --> 02:27:46,064
[SPEAKER_17]: Next up.

1373
02:27:47,464 --> 02:27:59,310
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm a little confused by, so we have on page 12 that we had five elementary teachers that were included to be cut in this.

1374
02:28:00,339 --> 02:28:10,401
[SPEAKER_17]: And when I go across the actual schools, I come up with, and then it says that we restored three, correct?

1375
02:28:12,242 --> 02:28:12,462
[SPEAKER_13]: Two.

1376
02:28:12,842 --> 02:28:13,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Two at elementary.

1377
02:28:15,063 --> 02:28:17,403
[SPEAKER_17]: So that should leave three elementary still cut.

1378
02:28:17,443 --> 02:28:23,845
[SPEAKER_17]: But when I go through the rest of the document, I show seven cuts to elementary teachers.

1379
02:28:26,124 --> 02:28:33,369
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I can tell you exactly where they are, and you can tell me if maybe I'm misunderstanding them.

1380
02:28:37,172 --> 02:28:44,658
[SPEAKER_17]: On the McGlynn Elementary classroom teachers, I see two teachers are cut, correct?

1381
02:28:47,141 --> 02:28:47,401
[SPEAKER_07]: members.

1382
02:28:47,441 --> 02:28:50,502
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I can, um, offer a point of.

1383
02:28:51,222 --> 02:28:52,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Clarification real quick.

1384
02:28:53,183 --> 02:28:56,664
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, the does this have to do, uh.

1385
02:28:57,925 --> 02:29:10,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. McHugh with the kindergarten teachers because there were four kindergarten teachers added to the budget after it was approved last year, so it doesn't look like a budget cut because they never were in the

1386
02:29:15,720 --> 02:29:27,891
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, well, then that form on it seven minus four is three so minus four three yes i'm I feel like that makes sense now, thank you, I do what I really appreciate this listing of positions and then the little.

1387
02:29:28,692 --> 02:29:35,078
[SPEAKER_17]: Like know at the bottom about like minus to reduce by to tease or whatever I think that really.

1388
02:29:35,718 --> 02:29:36,539
[SPEAKER_17]: was very helpful.

1389
02:29:37,760 --> 02:29:50,472
[SPEAKER_17]: Although this issue of adding things after the budget is approved is always the wonkiest part because like for all, you know, I went through the Medford Public Schools budgets going back into the 80s.

1390
02:29:50,953 --> 02:29:57,719
[SPEAKER_17]: This year, last year, this year, earlier this year I went to the library and there were a couple missing but almost all of them were there.

1391
02:29:57,739 --> 02:29:57,799
[SPEAKER_17]: And

1392
02:29:59,841 --> 02:30:08,926
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, being on the school committee, I know that this is the plan how we're going to spend money and has, in many regards, is not a reality.

1393
02:30:09,467 --> 02:30:13,109
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, at the highest level, it's a reality.

1394
02:30:13,309 --> 02:30:21,194
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know, all the positions we have in there, and we couldn't find somebody or we didn't actually have the money, like, it doesn't tell the story that

1395
02:30:22,014 --> 02:30:24,615
[SPEAKER_17]: most people rationally would think it tells.

1396
02:30:25,896 --> 02:30:34,900
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, you know, last year we added kindergarten teachers after the budget was set, because we do that often when kids just show up and register.

1397
02:30:36,280 --> 02:30:45,865
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm just wondering if you have recommendations, not for today, but for, you know, whether there's a policy recommendation you could have, where there's some kind of a

1398
02:30:48,406 --> 02:31:03,494
[SPEAKER_17]: a document or something that we can create that will help the future school committees and maybe the community if they're so interested to really know, okay, this was the plan, this is what happened, was short of my memory and

1399
02:31:03,914 --> 02:31:09,556
[SPEAKER_17]: you know, the people in the room, it just disappears into history as this unwritten thing.

1400
02:31:09,696 --> 02:31:17,579
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's really a problem because sometimes I, you know, many of us have had arguments on online about like, well, that's not what really happened.

1401
02:31:17,739 --> 02:31:21,460
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, they're looking at the document we published that says, this is what's going to happen.

1402
02:31:21,480 --> 02:31:23,881
[SPEAKER_17]: And we might know that didn't happen.

1403
02:31:23,921 --> 02:31:25,522
[SPEAKER_17]: But how do we communicate that?

1404
02:31:25,722 --> 02:31:26,242
[SPEAKER_17]: And yeah,

1405
02:31:28,723 --> 02:31:53,119
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, we did, I did try to explain that a little bit on, on during one of the, I can't remember if it was, it was at a committee of the whole meeting where, when we talked about when we were on class size, you know, we talked about cutting some positions, adding some other positions.

1406
02:31:53,640 --> 02:31:57,542
[SPEAKER_13]: And then there was a one line that said, you know, this assumes that the,

1407
02:31:59,143 --> 02:32:11,674
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, the four teachers that were added were not going to be tried to be included in FY 25, but yeah, you could you, we could have been more.

1408
02:32:14,236 --> 02:32:15,357
[SPEAKER_13]: descript about that.

1409
02:32:15,417 --> 02:32:21,139
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just that it didn't create a savings because the money really never existed.

1410
02:32:21,819 --> 02:32:39,866
[SPEAKER_13]: But if they were to be added to the budget, then you'd have the kind of the documentation that you would want with whenever you add positions like that after the year starts, you have to make sure that those positions get fixed in the budget, you know, going forward, if it's necessary to keep them.

1411
02:32:41,653 --> 02:32:41,953
[SPEAKER_16]: Got it.

1412
02:32:42,814 --> 02:32:43,274
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1413
02:32:46,196 --> 02:32:55,222
[SPEAKER_17]: Of the 18 positions that are still cut, assuming that number is right, and if it's not exact, were all of those positions actually positions with people in them?

1414
02:32:58,115 --> 02:33:12,078
[SPEAKER_13]: I know that the positions that were cut at the high school after we brought back two, those positions were all vacant at some point during the year.

1415
02:33:19,580 --> 02:33:23,141
[SPEAKER_13]: One of the positions that we didn't bring forward from

1416
02:33:27,386 --> 02:33:35,490
[SPEAKER_13]: the data and assessment director, that position became vacant just a couple of weeks ago.

1417
02:33:40,433 --> 02:33:42,074
[SPEAKER_17]: But most of them did have people.

1418
02:33:42,114 --> 02:33:47,857
[SPEAKER_13]: The re-engagement specialists, the 1.6, they were going to be vacant.

1419
02:33:47,917 --> 02:33:54,541
[SPEAKER_13]: So the one that we kept was still interested in serving in that position.

1420
02:33:57,248 --> 02:34:03,852
[SPEAKER_13]: It could have been one of the nurse positions too.

1421
02:34:04,112 --> 02:34:09,356
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we had a retirement there.

1422
02:34:09,736 --> 02:34:13,498
[SPEAKER_13]: If you want, we could come up with a report.

1423
02:34:17,183 --> 02:34:18,365
[SPEAKER_17]: I can probably figure it out.

1424
02:34:18,786 --> 02:34:30,021
[SPEAKER_17]: It's only been so many hours in the budget, but some of them would have blanks in there, which I think implied that they were open, like there was not somebody in them.

1425
02:34:30,742 --> 02:34:32,044
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not going to ask for a report.

1426
02:34:32,084 --> 02:34:33,265
[SPEAKER_17]: I asked for too many hesitations.

1427
02:34:34,475 --> 02:34:49,390
[SPEAKER_17]: I do want to, and I don't know if this is just something for the payroll folks or HR to fix, but on this, under district-wide instruction and assessment, we have coordinator of world language, coordinator of art, and coordinator of music.

1428
02:34:50,912 --> 02:34:54,996
[SPEAKER_17]: When we settled their contract, they are no longer called coordinators, they're called directors.

1429
02:34:57,455 --> 02:34:59,616
[SPEAKER_17]: obviously their pay is correct and all that other stuff.

1430
02:34:59,676 --> 02:35:03,678
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think that for a newbie reading this, you'd be like, oh, coordinator.

1431
02:35:03,698 --> 02:35:09,981
[SPEAKER_17]: And I thought there was a director and just to synchronize those things where appropriate.

1432
02:35:10,321 --> 02:35:14,263
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are the only three that I found where the title change would actually be necessary.

1433
02:35:14,883 --> 02:35:17,165
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know that one of them were not funding anyways, so.

1434
02:35:17,765 --> 02:35:18,945
[SPEAKER_13]: That's an easy fix, yep.

1435
02:35:18,965 --> 02:35:20,586
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, so,

1436
02:35:28,470 --> 02:35:38,379
[SPEAKER_17]: I know there was a very long, not long, it wasn't terribly long, there was a memo explaining the kindergarten teacher situation and

1437
02:35:40,467 --> 02:36:07,521
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lot to that conversation, but I just want to repeat something I think is what I'm understanding is, you know, when we have to do layoffs, we have to do them in a certain order according to the contract in that at the Missittook, because the staff was newer, they were the folks who we had to lay off, correct?

1438
02:36:12,150 --> 02:36:18,200
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, I'm not necessarily all of them, I'm not suggesting, I mean, the non-professional status staff are by default.

1439
02:36:18,902 --> 02:36:19,122
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1440
02:36:19,883 --> 02:36:22,328
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I guess what happens is first,

1441
02:36:24,430 --> 02:36:28,172
[SPEAKER_13]: the first thing you determine is how many positions do you need.

1442
02:36:29,572 --> 02:36:44,719
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's kind of our assessment was that there were these pockets of lower class sizes, you know, in the mid-teens to upper teens.

1443
02:36:46,684 --> 02:36:54,055
[SPEAKER_13]: would it be more reasonable, given the budget situation, to look at class sizes of between, say, 21 and 23?

1444
02:36:56,997 --> 02:37:02,020
[SPEAKER_13]: And then that resulted in how many positions do we need by school?

1445
02:37:03,241 --> 02:37:18,752
[SPEAKER_13]: The second look at that is, you know, to the extent there are layoffs, regardless of what school they're in, it's the non-tenured staff first,

1446
02:37:20,494 --> 02:37:27,200
[SPEAKER_13]: And that could be, and then you, there's gonna always be some non-renewals based on performance.

1447
02:37:27,460 --> 02:37:30,763
[SPEAKER_13]: So that might take care of some of those.

1448
02:37:31,023 --> 02:37:44,516
[SPEAKER_13]: And then you try to identify teachers that might, that have the certification that could teach in a different school that happens to need a teacher.

1449
02:37:46,750 --> 02:37:46,970
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1450
02:37:48,050 --> 02:37:50,711
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's just the point is it's really quite complicated.

1451
02:37:51,571 --> 02:37:51,811
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1452
02:37:52,292 --> 02:37:52,672
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1453
02:37:52,792 --> 02:38:01,714
[SPEAKER_13]: And we wouldn't target a school just because they had non-tenured or more new teachers.

1454
02:38:01,814 --> 02:38:08,796
[SPEAKER_13]: So it was really just based on analysis of how many students are in that school by grade.

1455
02:38:11,385 --> 02:38:14,906
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I'll let some other people speak.

1456
02:38:14,946 --> 02:38:16,627
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a motion to make, but I'll wait on it.

1457
02:38:16,687 --> 02:38:17,027
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1458
02:38:18,467 --> 02:38:19,007
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Reinfeld?

1459
02:38:20,388 --> 02:38:27,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Quick clarification, are the kindergarten teacher numbers based on projected enrollment or current actual enrollment?

1460
02:38:29,733 --> 02:38:31,254
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, yes to both.

1461
02:38:31,554 --> 02:38:35,738
[SPEAKER_13]: You take into account the current enrollment and then you make a projection.

1462
02:38:37,219 --> 02:38:47,447
[SPEAKER_13]: Kindergarten is always a little tough because you're not necessarily bringing in everybody who's in a pre-K program.

1463
02:38:48,548 --> 02:38:56,694
[SPEAKER_13]: So for kindergarten, we kind of use the average of the last three kindergarten classes

1464
02:38:59,224 --> 02:39:03,607
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's basically what the projection is for next year.

1465
02:39:05,288 --> 02:39:21,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, because I was curious and I will say, I'm more familiar with the Roberts just because that is where I have a student because the projected enrollment is the same as the current enrollment, but the number of teachers in the budget is less than the current number of teachers.

1466
02:39:21,958 --> 02:39:27,621
[SPEAKER_05]: So that is an increase in class size that we're expecting, we're not sure if we're gonna need

1467
02:39:28,655 --> 02:39:35,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, some of it was intentional by bumping up the class size a little bit.

1468
02:39:36,742 --> 02:39:47,953
[SPEAKER_13]: The other thing is when the incoming kindergarten students were born, the birth rate actually went down in MedFed.

1469
02:39:48,453 --> 02:39:49,954
[SPEAKER_13]: for that particular year.

1470
02:39:50,454 --> 02:39:55,316
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was also a little, played a role in the projection.

1471
02:39:55,396 --> 02:40:17,067
[SPEAKER_13]: So initially, the model suggested that the class sizes might be slightly lower because of that, but because of the increase in the prior year, I felt like we should err on the side of what we saw last year in terms of enrollment.

1472
02:40:20,039 --> 02:40:30,747
[SPEAKER_05]: Does the housing market play a role in that in terms of, you know, I know there are neighborhoods where we're seeing a lot of younger families move in unrelated to birth rates.

1473
02:40:30,967 --> 02:40:42,156
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, so that's a bit of a wild card because that can kind of skew the numbers up or down because those parents aren't reflected in the MEDFED birth rate.

1474
02:40:43,997 --> 02:40:45,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, okay, thank you.

1475
02:40:50,085 --> 02:40:51,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Other questions from the committee?

1476
02:40:58,806 --> 02:41:07,151
[SPEAKER_13]: I just, maybe I should also offer here that we're looking at those kindergarten registrations on a weekly basis.

1477
02:41:07,251 --> 02:41:15,616
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, we have our eyes on the Roberts and the Brooks.

1478
02:41:16,477 --> 02:41:27,904
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not, the registrations have not exceeded our predictions yet, but they're probably close, you know, given the,

1479
02:41:28,735 --> 02:41:35,097
[SPEAKER_13]: the time of year we're at, and the McGlynn and the Ms.

1480
02:41:35,157 --> 02:41:49,862
[SPEAKER_13]: Tucker still kind of look like they're on track, but we would want to take some action as soon as possible if we felt like we had to add some kindergarten grades.

1481
02:41:52,904 --> 02:41:53,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1482
02:41:53,464 --> 02:41:53,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Rousseau?

1483
02:41:55,626 --> 02:41:56,486
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1484
02:41:56,606 --> 02:41:59,028
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to make a motion at this time.

1485
02:41:59,048 --> 02:42:16,976
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to motion that Vice Chair Graham will work with the financial task force on behalf of the school committee to request additional supplemental funding in fiscal year 2025 to increase the substitute pay addition of K teachers to lower class

1486
02:42:17,896 --> 02:42:27,081
[SPEAKER_17]: in order to lower class size, increase after-school capacity, and to fund recruitment of permanent substitutes for all schools.

1487
02:42:27,921 --> 02:42:31,303
[SPEAKER_17]: And the substitute pay, that's the end quote.

1488
02:42:32,584 --> 02:42:38,547
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know that in some communities, or maybe even many or most communities, substitute pay is actually part of a contract.

1489
02:42:38,607 --> 02:42:39,767
[SPEAKER_17]: In Medford, it isn't.

1490
02:42:41,548 --> 02:42:43,810
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that that is,

1491
02:42:45,506 --> 02:43:09,634
[SPEAKER_17]: both good and bad, if it was in a contract, maybe it would be higher already, but because it's not, we can actually be, if we can secure more funding and we can target it that way, we can increase our substitute pay to whatever we want, well, assuming we can find the money, to really solve what is a crisis, I think, in some places where there's just no substitutes.

1492
02:43:10,394 --> 02:43:14,095
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, whether it's a pay problem or not,

1493
02:43:15,367 --> 02:43:24,192
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, you know, the way our lives are created and oriented nowadays and the cost to live in Medford and all the other things makes it hard to find people for sure.

1494
02:43:24,672 --> 02:43:33,137
[SPEAKER_17]: But when there are some number of people doing this work and they have choices, Medford at one rate and then one town over, you know.

1495
02:43:34,353 --> 02:43:41,880
[SPEAKER_17]: 100 yards away for dramatically more money, it's kind of hard for anybody to rationally choose the worst pay.

1496
02:43:42,201 --> 02:43:44,082
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's my motion.

1497
02:43:44,102 --> 02:43:44,743
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm happy to repeat it.

1498
02:43:44,783 --> 02:43:45,464
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll second that.

1499
02:43:48,667 --> 02:43:49,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Rousseau, can you repeat it again?

1500
02:43:50,404 --> 02:43:51,004
[SPEAKER_17]: I can, yes.

1501
02:43:51,905 --> 02:44:01,293
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice Chair Graham will work with the City Financial Task Force on behalf of the School Committee to request additional supplemental funding in fiscal year 2025 to increase the substitute pay

1502
02:44:07,177 --> 02:44:16,060
[SPEAKER_17]: addition of K teachers to lower class size, increase afterschool capacity, and recruitment of permanent substitutes for all schools.

1503
02:44:16,100 --> 02:44:21,342
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm gonna drop it in the chat so any member that wants to, likes to read can do that.

1504
02:44:21,362 --> 02:44:25,504
[SPEAKER_17]: Once I figure out how to do this for all.

1505
02:44:28,245 --> 02:44:28,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1506
02:44:28,645 --> 02:44:30,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Intoppa, did you have a question about the motion?

1507
02:44:31,380 --> 02:44:51,895
[SPEAKER_19]: I was hoping to possibly make an amendment to also add into the language to find a way to increase the stipend pay for the band director with the idea that the pay that it is at may not be attractive to external candidates and that there will be a significant decline in the program's activity.

1508
02:44:51,995 --> 02:44:53,496
[SPEAKER_05]: That's contractual.

1509
02:44:53,956 --> 02:44:54,777
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it contractual?

1510
02:44:55,777 --> 02:44:57,038
[SPEAKER_05]: It's in the teacher's contract.

1511
02:44:57,238 --> 02:44:58,519
[SPEAKER_05]: All the stipend rates are there.

1512
02:44:58,579 --> 02:44:59,360
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

1513
02:44:59,440 --> 02:45:00,000
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you very much.

1514
02:45:02,787 --> 02:45:20,320
[SPEAKER_07]: But to your, I think to the spirit of what you were trying to do, Member Intoppa, one of the things like on my personal list, if we are to see a successful override in November is to get back to addressing those stipends.

1515
02:45:21,281 --> 02:45:32,910
[SPEAKER_07]: I know there have been some joint labor discussions with the teachers union about those stipends, which obviously has stalled because there has been no money in the budget to really think through that.

1516
02:45:33,911 --> 02:45:39,215
[SPEAKER_07]: But in terms of like sort of how like how did we create the the number is

1517
02:45:40,476 --> 02:46:00,428
[SPEAKER_07]: a complex question in terms of where those override numbers came from, but very much on my mind were a number of things, including the stipend district-wide, not just for the band, but for all of our athletic coaches, for all of our after-school, all of our advisors, and all of that.

1518
02:46:00,448 --> 02:46:01,969
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's sort of a packaged

1519
02:46:02,529 --> 02:46:08,993
[SPEAKER_07]: deal that when you think about all of those stipends together, it is not a few thousand dollars that needs to change.

1520
02:46:09,053 --> 02:46:10,154
[SPEAKER_07]: It's quite significant.

1521
02:46:10,254 --> 02:46:19,639
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I am hopeful that with a successful two override votes in November that we will have some breathing room to be able to get back to that conversation.

1522
02:46:19,739 --> 02:46:23,742
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I'll see you at the doors convincing people of that with me.

1523
02:46:24,142 --> 02:46:24,442
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1524
02:46:25,282 --> 02:46:26,923
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for the clarity, Vice Chair Grammich.

1525
02:46:26,963 --> 02:46:27,544
[SPEAKER_19]: I could actually

1526
02:46:28,384 --> 02:46:35,730
[SPEAKER_19]: make an, I don't know if this is an amendment making an amendment, if Member Rousseau is making the amendment herself, if I could second the amendment to increase funds available.

1527
02:46:37,411 --> 02:46:39,472
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just suggesting that might be the language you could use.

1528
02:46:39,892 --> 02:46:47,278
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I would be willing to adapt that language, amend my amendment to amend to that language for the amendment of your motion.

1529
02:46:48,038 --> 02:46:48,679
[SPEAKER_19]: So be it there.

1530
02:46:50,280 --> 02:46:53,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Member Rousseau, can you read the amended motion?

1531
02:46:53,775 --> 02:46:54,236
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.

1532
02:46:54,816 --> 02:47:12,554
[SPEAKER_17]: Vice Chair Graham will work with the financial task force on behalf of the school committee to request additional supplemental funding in fiscal year 2025 to increase the substitute pay, addition of K teachers to lower class size, increase afterschool capacity, increase funds available to additional funds

1533
02:47:18,393 --> 02:47:26,159
[SPEAKER_17]: to increase stipend pay in negotiations with our union partners, and recruitment of permanent substitutes for all schools.

1534
02:47:28,240 --> 02:47:31,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, on the motion by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member Rheinfeld.

1535
02:47:31,943 --> 02:47:32,603
[SPEAKER_07]: Roll call, please.

1536
02:47:36,466 --> 02:47:37,887
[SPEAKER_17]: How many things can I do at once?

1537
02:47:43,611 --> 02:47:44,192
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Granley.

1538
02:47:45,072 --> 02:47:45,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1539
02:47:46,153 --> 02:47:46,673
[SPEAKER_16]: Member Granley.

1540
02:47:47,054 --> 02:47:47,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1541
02:47:47,827 --> 02:47:48,548
[SPEAKER_17]: Remembering Papa?

1542
02:47:48,948 --> 02:47:49,209
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1543
02:47:49,709 --> 02:47:50,430
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Olapade?

1544
02:47:50,450 --> 02:47:51,151
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1545
02:47:51,711 --> 02:47:52,412
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Rheinfeld?

1546
02:47:52,953 --> 02:47:53,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1547
02:47:54,054 --> 02:47:55,816
[SPEAKER_17]: So yes, Mayor is absent.

1548
02:47:56,697 --> 02:48:00,661
[SPEAKER_07]: So six in the affirmative, one absent, the motion is approved.

1549
02:48:02,243 --> 02:48:03,364
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you all for that.

1550
02:48:03,444 --> 02:48:05,947
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have taken notes on my

1551
02:48:07,202 --> 02:48:10,624
[SPEAKER_07]: tasks going forward, and we will hopefully report back with something successful.

1552
02:48:12,405 --> 02:48:25,213
[SPEAKER_07]: Before, I do want to ask if there are members on Zoom who would like to provide comment, but before we do that, I just had a couple of things I wanted to say and clarify.

1553
02:48:27,154 --> 02:48:28,816
[SPEAKER_07]: That I think is important.

1554
02:48:28,896 --> 02:48:39,907
[SPEAKER_07]: So this budget does tell a really nice story about how we got here over the course of many meetings through open and transparent process.

1555
02:48:39,927 --> 02:48:42,210
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you for that, Jerry.

1556
02:48:43,191 --> 02:48:44,912
[SPEAKER_07]: This also does reflect

1557
02:48:46,534 --> 02:48:48,857
[SPEAKER_07]: a lot of what I call budget cleanups.

1558
02:48:49,037 --> 02:48:59,488
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the things that does get complicated in future years when you come back and look at this budget, you're like, why did that change so substantially?

1559
02:49:00,489 --> 02:49:04,613
[SPEAKER_07]: And so maybe there is a need to put an asterisk in the budget that says like,

1560
02:49:05,154 --> 02:49:16,824
[SPEAKER_07]: There was sort of cleanup of accounts and movement and reclassifications that happen, which mean which the consequences like some of these accounts look like they either artificially inflated or deflated.

1561
02:49:18,486 --> 02:49:24,872
[SPEAKER_07]: When in fact, that's really was just a reflection of reclassifying positions into the right places.

1562
02:49:26,849 --> 02:49:39,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I also thought the format was very digestible, and I appreciated completely that we didn't kill nearly as many trees in the printing of this budget as we do on the regular when we print budgets.

1563
02:49:40,878 --> 02:49:52,485
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing that I thought was really compelling, and I just wanted to say thank you for it, was the charts at the front that really clearly describe, like, what are our enrollments in each school and in each grades?

1564
02:49:53,766 --> 02:50:16,969
[SPEAKER_07]: how does the staff that supports the building lay out in the in the various buildings and so if you look at you know what happens on page four and what happens on page five you have a really clear picture of how many students are in this building and you have a really clear picture of like and what staff is there to support them so I think that's something that's been very missing from our budgets for a really long time so

1565
02:50:18,109 --> 02:50:18,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I am really happy with that.

1566
02:50:19,771 --> 02:50:21,253
[SPEAKER_07]: I love the new format.

1567
02:50:22,114 --> 02:50:26,439
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't take me like 17 years to read the budget and get ready for this meeting.

1568
02:50:26,579 --> 02:50:32,586
[SPEAKER_07]: And because it sort of provided that narrative that you just have to sort of sleuth together yourself.

1569
02:50:32,626 --> 02:50:33,246
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

1570
02:50:33,927 --> 02:50:34,788
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for all of that.

1571
02:50:35,889 --> 02:50:53,978
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will say, just to sort of quickly recap for people who are on the call and listening, under the citywide budget ordinance, the process kicked off for us in February.

1572
02:50:53,998 --> 02:50:59,900
[SPEAKER_07]: And in March, the mayor is required under the ordinance to provide an initial allocation.

1573
02:50:59,940 --> 02:51:01,661
[SPEAKER_07]: And when she did at that time, it was 73.5 million.

1574
02:51:04,102 --> 02:51:23,857
[SPEAKER_07]: We then, Jerry and team and the superintendent then got to work to sort of try to sort of land somewhere in hybrid territory of like not just what do we need, but like how can we put how could we possibly get to that number because this ramp off of Essar is significant and important.

1575
02:51:25,658 --> 02:51:33,724
[SPEAKER_07]: In the end, the work of the mayor with the approval of the city council brought our budget to $77.75 million.

1576
02:51:33,784 --> 02:51:37,747
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's like a multi-million dollar increase over the initial allocation.

1577
02:51:37,847 --> 02:51:42,310
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's a really important point that we have avoided.

1578
02:51:44,051 --> 02:51:52,378
[SPEAKER_07]: cuts that we hadn't even yet brought ourselves to discuss because we were able to the city was able to find some additional funding for the schools.

1579
02:51:53,239 --> 02:51:54,880
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's that is super important.

1580
02:51:55,721 --> 02:51:59,564
[SPEAKER_07]: This budget is not a level service budget because there are still cuts.

1581
02:52:00,104 --> 02:52:00,745
[SPEAKER_07]: That is true.

1582
02:52:01,906 --> 02:52:05,028
[SPEAKER_07]: This budget also does not do that many new things.

1583
02:52:05,869 --> 02:52:12,034
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are some new things that are happening administratively in terms of properly funding accounts that were underfunded before.

1584
02:52:12,134 --> 02:52:12,295
[SPEAKER_07]: So

1585
02:52:13,195 --> 02:52:27,785
[SPEAKER_07]: There are things happening that I think are really important that are new, but in terms of like new programs that you would be able to see or sort of feel in the schools, there's, there's not much in the way of new programming planned under this budget.

1586
02:52:31,848 --> 02:52:35,410
[SPEAKER_07]: better days ahead on that front as well as we look forward.

1587
02:52:35,570 --> 02:52:45,914
[SPEAKER_07]: So I am gonna ask if there's anyone who would like to provide comment, please just raise your hand.

1588
02:52:45,934 --> 02:52:50,255
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna ask you to limit your comments to two minutes.

1589
02:52:50,935 --> 02:52:56,017
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you could start by giving us your name and address for the record, that would be appreciated.

1590
02:52:56,157 --> 02:52:58,358
[SPEAKER_07]: So if there is anybody who would like to provide comment,

1591
02:53:00,759 --> 02:53:19,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Please put your hand in the air.

1592
02:53:20,527 --> 02:53:21,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Jessica Healy.

1593
02:53:26,314 --> 02:53:28,615
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Jessica Haley, Four Lock Road, Medford.

1594
02:53:29,576 --> 02:53:30,616
[SPEAKER_08]: I just have a question.

1595
02:53:30,836 --> 02:53:37,580
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not sure if this exactly has to do with the budget, but if we have a sixth grade special ed teacher at the McGlynn.

1596
02:53:42,643 --> 02:53:44,384
[SPEAKER_07]: Superintendent, can you answer that question?

1597
02:53:44,464 --> 02:53:47,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a sixth grade special ed teacher at the McGlynn?

1598
02:53:47,865 --> 02:53:49,787
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you can do that one off the top of your head.

1599
02:53:51,047 --> 02:53:51,868
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to say yes.

1600
02:53:54,184 --> 02:53:54,484
[SPEAKER_14]: Is Ms.

1601
02:53:54,524 --> 02:53:55,365
[SPEAKER_14]: Bowen on the call?

1602
02:53:56,286 --> 02:53:58,128
[SPEAKER_14]: I see her square.

1603
02:53:58,148 --> 02:54:06,356
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that due to IEPs, we must remain in compliance to serve all of our students.

1604
02:54:07,116 --> 02:54:19,048
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know there's an A side and a B side so that for all of our students on IEPs, they will be receiving appropriate services because we are mandated by law to do that.

1605
02:54:20,481 --> 02:54:26,324
[SPEAKER_14]: even if it's a different grade level, we are mandated to service all of our students that are on IEPs.

1606
02:54:26,985 --> 02:54:31,627
[SPEAKER_14]: So I can assure you that all students will receive appropriate services.

1607
02:54:33,728 --> 02:54:35,629
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I could address that too.

1608
02:54:36,250 --> 02:54:36,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1609
02:54:37,610 --> 02:54:48,236
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanna let Jessica know that the job has been posted and Mr. Tucci and I are in the process of interviewing candidates for that specific position.

1610
02:54:49,028 --> 02:54:52,712
[SPEAKER_03]: So our intent is to have it filled by the start of next school year.

1611
02:54:54,053 --> 02:54:55,014
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

1612
02:54:55,635 --> 02:54:56,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Ms.

1613
02:54:56,095 --> 02:54:56,355
[SPEAKER_06]: Bowen.

1614
02:55:01,781 --> 02:55:03,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions or comments?

1615
02:55:05,524 --> 02:55:06,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Lily Scott?

1616
02:55:22,352 --> 02:55:24,133
[SPEAKER_14]: Dr. Cushing, are you able to... Oh, here we go.

1617
02:55:24,153 --> 02:55:25,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Lily.

1618
02:55:25,733 --> 02:55:26,374
[SPEAKER_04]: I was on mute.

1619
02:55:26,434 --> 02:55:26,694
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

1620
02:55:26,854 --> 02:55:27,414
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

1621
02:55:27,974 --> 02:55:29,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Lily Scott, 30 College Ave.

1622
02:55:29,775 --> 02:55:31,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the information tonight.

1623
02:55:32,476 --> 02:55:42,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Just had a quick question on the numbers where it said that three elementary school teachers were cut district-wide.

1624
02:55:44,380 --> 02:55:59,126
[SPEAKER_04]: And just wanted to confirm that was true because it looked like when comparing the numbers on the sheet that the superintendent sent out on Friday, that it actually looked like more cuts were there.

1625
02:55:59,246 --> 02:56:02,888
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was just curious where that, where those numbers kind of balanced.

1626
02:56:04,309 --> 02:56:06,530
[SPEAKER_07]: Um Lily, I can maybe take a shot at that.

1627
02:56:06,650 --> 02:56:13,713
[SPEAKER_07]: So there while there were, um, there's a net reduction of three positions in this budget.

1628
02:56:14,514 --> 02:56:19,636
[SPEAKER_07]: Um and that includes increases in some places and decreases in other places.

1629
02:56:19,736 --> 02:56:22,397
[SPEAKER_07]: So the net reduction is three.

1630
02:56:22,417 --> 02:56:30,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but that there are additions in various places and, um and offsetting reductions.

1631
02:56:30,101 --> 02:56:30,841
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um,

1632
02:56:31,789 --> 02:56:50,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the picture is very complicated, but if you saw the superintendent's memo, I think from Friday night, after the table, there's a good explanation of the reductions happening across the district, but I don't, I can't remember off the top of my head if the additions were focused on there as well.

1633
02:56:50,525 --> 02:56:53,808
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'd have to sort of use the chart and the description to net that out.

1634
02:56:57,331 --> 02:56:59,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions, comments?

1635
02:57:08,884 --> 02:57:10,945
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, for the school committee.

1636
02:57:11,885 --> 02:57:13,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there, um.

1637
02:57:15,026 --> 02:57:21,147
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion to sever the teachers line item from the budget?

1638
02:57:24,788 --> 02:57:25,209
[SPEAKER_17]: It was.

1639
02:57:25,469 --> 02:57:28,429
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a motion by member of Brandling.

1640
02:57:29,170 --> 02:57:31,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a second second seconded by

1641
02:57:42,802 --> 02:57:43,542
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that was a yes.

1642
02:57:43,582 --> 02:57:44,003
[SPEAKER_17]: Memogram?

1643
02:57:44,303 --> 02:57:44,563
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1644
02:57:44,743 --> 02:57:45,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sorry.

1645
02:57:45,924 --> 02:57:47,044
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Papa?

1646
02:57:47,484 --> 02:57:47,764
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1647
02:57:48,285 --> 02:57:49,005
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Olapade?

1648
02:57:49,425 --> 02:57:49,645
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1649
02:57:50,226 --> 02:57:50,806
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Rheinfeldt?

1650
02:57:51,106 --> 02:57:51,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1651
02:57:52,227 --> 02:57:52,927
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Rousseau?

1652
02:57:53,027 --> 02:57:53,287
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1653
02:57:53,387 --> 02:57:54,948
[SPEAKER_17]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn is absent.

1654
02:57:55,948 --> 02:57:58,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

1655
02:57:58,329 --> 02:57:59,310
[SPEAKER_07]: The motion passes.

1656
02:58:01,171 --> 02:58:05,193
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion to approve the teacher line item in the budget?

1657
02:58:07,374 --> 02:58:09,695
[SPEAKER_17]: Motion to approve the teacher line item in the budget.

1658
02:58:10,933 --> 02:58:12,774

02:58:14,175 --> 02:58:14,536

[SPEAKER_16]: Member Branley.

1663
02:58:26,805 --> 02:58:27,225
[SPEAKER_17]: Abstain.

1664
02:58:28,506 --> 02:58:29,347
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, right, sorry.

1665
02:58:30,908 --> 02:58:31,909
[SPEAKER_17]: I shouldn't have even asked.

1666
02:58:33,050 --> 02:58:33,570
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Graham.

1667
02:58:34,331 --> 02:58:34,551
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1668
02:58:35,552 --> 02:58:36,092
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Intoppa.

1669
02:58:39,622 --> 02:58:40,323
[SPEAKER_17]: John, I missed that.

1670
02:58:40,583 --> 02:58:41,203
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, okay.

1671
02:58:41,984 --> 02:58:42,645
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Olapade.

1672
02:58:43,245 --> 02:58:43,545
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1673
02:58:44,626 --> 02:58:45,908
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Rheinfeld.

1674
02:58:46,268 --> 02:58:46,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1675
02:58:47,069 --> 02:58:49,090
[SPEAKER_17]: Member Soyes, Mayor Lungo-Koehn is absent.

1676
02:58:51,773 --> 02:58:55,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Five in the affirmative, one abstention, one absent.

1677
02:58:55,596 --> 02:59:00,140
[SPEAKER_07]: The teacher line item of the Medford Public Schools 2024-2025 budget passes.

1678
02:59:01,681 --> 02:59:04,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we continue, I see somebody with a hand.

1679
02:59:04,324 --> 02:59:06,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Christina, you have two minutes.

1680
02:59:20,656 --> 02:59:31,606
[SPEAKER_18]: When looking at the elementary memo, the class sizes aren't really compared consistently school to school.

1681
02:59:31,626 --> 02:59:37,671
[SPEAKER_18]: I believe that in the Brooks, the general classroom numbers are 100% of the kids.

1682
02:59:39,233 --> 02:59:52,706
[SPEAKER_18]: And so that shows like a maximum amount of kids in your classroom at a time, whereas at the other schools that have subseparate classrooms that work differently, where the student is placed with the subseparate classroom teacher.

1683
02:59:53,752 --> 02:59:57,894
[SPEAKER_18]: but then pushes in for academic and social time.

1684
02:59:57,994 --> 03:00:04,578
[SPEAKER_18]: Those numbers are all a minimum student class, like how many students you have present in your classroom.

1685
03:00:05,259 --> 03:00:10,102
[SPEAKER_18]: And that was kind of upsetting, getting that document, especially because

1686
03:00:11,022 --> 03:00:22,668
[SPEAKER_18]: It was titled equity, like the classes were being made equitably, and I think using that word inaccurately, we're really talking about making the classes equally.

1687
03:00:22,688 --> 03:00:33,733
[SPEAKER_18]: It really felt badly because first, the numbers aren't really a fair comparison, and then that doesn't even take into account looking at the needs

1688
03:00:34,673 --> 03:00:54,041
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just wanted to state that because I think if there is a document that's going to be comparing, I know it's hard to make a real document of how many bodies are really in a classroom at a time, but that one was misleading and also the way the cuts are expressed as being like two cuts.

1689
03:00:55,244 --> 03:01:13,389
[SPEAKER_18]: I know at our school, at Mississauga, it said two cuts, and at the other schools, it might not actually have been whatever it said, because you're looking at the class rising, and that's really where the cuts are, not so much at the grade level, which is a whole group of kids coming in.

1690
03:01:13,429 --> 03:01:15,670
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just wanted to state that.

1691
03:01:15,930 --> 03:01:16,250
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

1692
03:01:16,350 --> 03:01:16,730
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1693
03:01:17,290 --> 03:01:17,990
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Christina.

1694
03:01:18,410 --> 03:01:21,291
[SPEAKER_07]: Jessica, can you please state your name and address for the record?

1695
03:01:26,894 --> 03:01:50,857
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, I'm Simon Parks, and I think that, hello, and I think that, I think that, I forgot what I was gonna say, sorry.

1696
03:01:51,638 --> 03:01:52,639
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

1697
03:01:53,280 --> 03:01:54,161
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay, Simon.

1698
03:01:54,181 --> 03:01:55,642
[SPEAKER_07]: We all do that from time to time.

1699
03:01:57,964 --> 03:02:00,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Even when you're on the school committee, we do it too.

1700
03:02:00,587 --> 03:02:05,692
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to say something or no?

1701
03:02:06,353 --> 03:02:06,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you done?

1702
03:02:07,975 --> 03:02:08,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, he's done.

1703
03:02:11,098 --> 03:02:11,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Simon.

1704
03:02:12,259 --> 03:02:14,982
[SPEAKER_07]: We look forward to you running for school committee someday, okay?

1705
03:02:18,144 --> 03:02:19,284
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, okay.

1706
03:02:19,824 --> 03:02:26,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion to approve the remainder of the FY 2024 FY 2025 budget?

1707
03:02:28,726 --> 03:02:29,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to approve.

[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_16]: Remember Grant?

1714
03:02:50,000 --> 03:02:50,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

1719
03:02:56,741 --> 03:02:57,462
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember Ranfell?

1720
03:02:58,942 --> 03:02:59,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1726
03:03:17,506 --> 03:03:18,929
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going to move on to new business.

1727
03:03:19,631 --> 03:03:25,565
[SPEAKER_07]: Item 2024-29 offered by Member Rousseau is a new policy around capital planning.

1728
03:03:26,198 --> 03:03:33,863
[SPEAKER_07]: or it's a codification of our policy that did come out of the strategic and capital planning subcommittee some weeks ago.

1729
03:03:33,943 --> 03:03:36,684
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you member Rousseau for writing it.

1730
03:03:37,865 --> 03:03:47,771
[SPEAKER_07]: It is something that we will have to submit to the MSBA shortly with our capital maintenance and capital planning deliverable.

1731
03:03:48,331 --> 03:03:52,616
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to read it and then take any questions.

1732
03:03:52,716 --> 03:03:56,019
[SPEAKER_07]: So the school committee will develop a capital improvement plan annually.

1733
03:03:56,159 --> 03:04:02,666
[SPEAKER_07]: Preparations for annual approval of the capital improvement plan will be scheduled in phases throughout the school year with attention to certain deadlines.

1734
03:04:02,806 --> 03:04:05,068
[SPEAKER_07]: So phase one, capital project identification.

1735
03:04:05,769 --> 03:04:13,814
[SPEAKER_07]: Between September 1st and October 15th, the superintendent will ensure that school building leaders have submitted all outstanding maintenance work in the district-wide ticketing system.

1736
03:04:14,515 --> 03:04:19,278
[SPEAKER_07]: Phase 2 strategic and capital planning subcommittee meeting target dates October 15th to November 30.

1737
03:04:19,358 --> 03:04:25,662
[SPEAKER_07]: The strategic and capital planning subcommittee will meet to review and prepare recommendations for the committee of the whole to be held per phase 3.

1738
03:04:26,522 --> 03:04:41,115
[SPEAKER_07]: The subcommittee will create four lists of projects, capital projects eligible for Community Preservation Act funding, capital projects eligible for net school spending, capital projects not eligible for community preservation or net school spending, and D, all capital projects.

1739
03:04:42,196 --> 03:04:48,962
[SPEAKER_07]: The subcommittee will prioritize the individual items within each list, and the school committee will forward these artifacts to the committee per phase three.

1740
03:04:50,034 --> 03:04:56,479
[SPEAKER_07]: In phase three, the committee of the whole review and approval will occur between December 1st and December 31st.

1741
03:04:56,980 --> 03:05:05,967
[SPEAKER_07]: The committee will review the projects received from phase two, and the committee will report a capital improvement plan to the next regular school committee meeting for approval.

1742
03:05:07,849 --> 03:05:12,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Phase four, school committee approval of the capital improvement plan.

1743
03:05:13,454 --> 03:05:14,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, give me just one second.

1744
03:05:14,715 --> 03:05:16,796
[SPEAKER_07]: My computer's gonna die here if I don't plug in.

1745
03:05:16,896 --> 03:05:17,497
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna lose you all.

1746
03:05:20,911 --> 03:05:21,812
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here we go.

1747
03:05:22,713 --> 03:05:23,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry about that.

1748
03:05:24,975 --> 03:05:34,145
[SPEAKER_07]: So the school committee approval of the capital improvement plan and phase four target dates January one to January 31, the school committee will consider approval of the capital improvement plan.

1749
03:05:34,795 --> 03:05:39,719
[SPEAKER_07]: In phase five, the capital improvement plan will be submitted to the city council, target date January 31.

1750
03:05:40,359 --> 03:05:45,423
[SPEAKER_07]: The approved school committee capital plan will be forwarded to the city of Medford with a funding request to implement the plan.

1751
03:05:46,624 --> 03:05:52,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Phase six is a publication of the capital improvement plan, which has a target date of February 28th.

1752
03:05:53,809 --> 03:05:58,892
[SPEAKER_07]: The capital improvement plan will be published in the school committee section of the Medford Public Schools website.

1753
03:06:01,474 --> 03:06:01,634
[SPEAKER_07]: And...

1754
03:06:04,330 --> 03:06:09,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Phase seven is inclusion of capital projects eligible for net school spending in the budget request.

1755
03:06:10,413 --> 03:06:12,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Target date, February 1st to February 28th.

1756
03:06:13,835 --> 03:06:20,619
[SPEAKER_07]: All capital projects eligible for net school spending that could be reasonably accomplished within the upcoming fiscal year will be incorporated into the budget request.

1757
03:06:20,739 --> 03:06:31,805
[SPEAKER_07]: All capital projects eligible for net school spending but not included in the budget request will be detailed in the budget request as an attachment and explain why all the projects cannot be reasonably accomplished in the upcoming fiscal year.

1758
03:06:32,745 --> 03:06:41,495
[SPEAKER_07]: And then phase eight, public school administration submits Community Preservation Committee grant applications with a target date of July 1 to July 31.

1759
03:06:41,616 --> 03:06:50,186
[SPEAKER_07]: The grant applications eligible for the Community Preservation Act funding shall be submitted to the Community Preservation Committee.

1760
03:06:51,561 --> 03:06:53,584
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a couple of definitions here as well.

1761
03:06:54,605 --> 03:06:56,667
[SPEAKER_07]: One is a definition of the capital improvement plan.

1762
03:06:56,687 --> 03:07:02,493
[SPEAKER_07]: The capital improvement plan typically consists of one or more capital improvement projects which are financed through a capital budget.

1763
03:07:02,713 --> 03:07:07,738
[SPEAKER_07]: CIPs are important tools for local governments, allowing them to plan strategically for community growth and transformation.

1764
03:07:08,633 --> 03:07:13,121
[SPEAKER_07]: A capital improvement project is an asset upgrade or large scale maintenance work.

1765
03:07:13,201 --> 03:07:20,794
[SPEAKER_07]: Some examples of capital projects include building a new school, replacing outdated HVAC systems, replacing a roof, or any project above $150,000 per school building.

1766
03:07:22,830 --> 03:07:35,738
[SPEAKER_07]: The Community Preservation Act is a Massachusetts law passed in 2000, enabling communities to assess a tax on real property for open space protection, historic preservation, affordable housing and outdoor recreation.

1767
03:07:36,558 --> 03:07:45,764
[SPEAKER_07]: The Community Preservation Committee is a committee established by the city council here in Medford to make recommendations for spending of community preservation funds.

1768
03:07:46,504 --> 03:07:52,348
[SPEAKER_07]: And the Community Preservation Fund is a city established fund to contain the monies raised from taxes for the spending of those funds.

1769
03:07:53,491 --> 03:08:07,323
[SPEAKER_07]: and then net school spending all funds expended by the school committee via the budget grants or other funds, as well as certain city expenditures such as infrastructure and pensions, excluding certain types of expenditures such as transportation, adult education, and long-term debt.

1770
03:08:09,905 --> 03:08:16,670
[SPEAKER_07]: So that is the proposed policy that would line up well with the,

1771
03:08:18,628 --> 03:08:24,856
[SPEAKER_07]: policy that we passed around our budget process just a week ago, I believe, or two weeks ago.

1772
03:08:26,158 --> 03:08:27,820
[SPEAKER_07]: Members, so is there anything else you'd like to say?

1773
03:08:29,182 --> 03:08:31,725
[SPEAKER_17]: No, only that you must need a drink of water now.

1774
03:08:34,557 --> 03:08:40,080
[SPEAKER_17]: I was looking for any kinds of typos and stuff like we had in the last one and I think we made it through.

1775
03:08:40,961 --> 03:08:44,843
[SPEAKER_17]: So yeah, so this was the work of the strategic planning subcommittee.

1776
03:08:44,944 --> 03:08:55,691
[SPEAKER_17]: We kind of outlined the important dates and I was tasked with taking those four or five little notes and turning them into a policy and they are lining up with the city's

1777
03:08:56,331 --> 03:09:09,637
[SPEAKER_17]: budget ordinance, which is that March 1D isn't actually listed there, but that's why some things have to be done by the 28th of February, but also lines up with our budget policy we just approved a week or two ago.

1778
03:09:09,697 --> 03:09:11,858
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm happy to answer any questions.

1779
03:09:13,219 --> 03:09:13,779
[SPEAKER_06]: Member Reinfeld?

1780
03:09:19,062 --> 03:09:19,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you're on mute.

1781
03:09:22,389 --> 03:09:34,792
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, in phase 2.2c, the capital projects not eligible for community preservation or net school spending, those just get incorporated into the plan itself and don't need any kind of special call out for funding requests, correct?

1782
03:09:36,393 --> 03:09:41,034
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, those lists really are to prioritize.

1783
03:09:41,977 --> 03:09:47,580
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, in my mind, each of those lists should be individually prioritized, which is actually the next step.

1784
03:09:47,781 --> 03:09:59,368
[SPEAKER_17]: And then if we're asking for funding from the CPC, then even if it's something that could be covered under net school spending, it would be in both lists.

1785
03:10:00,368 --> 03:10:02,229
[SPEAKER_17]: items will be could be in multiple lists.

1786
03:10:02,329 --> 03:10:03,470
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay yeah I wasn't.

1787
03:10:03,490 --> 03:10:17,516
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah so these items not eligible for Community Preservation Act or net school spending would be any major physical upgrade or something that's more than $150,000 that CPC doesn't cover.

1788
03:10:19,097 --> 03:10:26,701
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that these lists is also a way to communicate to the well aside from to the council but to the community it's like here's the real list

1789
03:10:28,194 --> 03:10:37,941
[SPEAKER_17]: of projects that we can't do, which is whether it's because we don't have the capacity financially or infrastructure of staffing or something.

1790
03:10:38,741 --> 03:10:52,790
[SPEAKER_05]: And so then following on that, it's presumably out of the scope of this policy to request from the city that they respond to the phase five here, the approved, go forward it to the city of Medford with the funding request.

1791
03:10:53,991 --> 03:11:02,153
[SPEAKER_05]: we're going to assume, hello, we're going to assume that we get that information back, but that's outside the scope of the policy, correct?

1792
03:11:02,934 --> 03:11:03,354
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct.

1793
03:11:03,414 --> 03:11:08,035
[SPEAKER_17]: We're going to send it and we're going to, it'll be added, I think it goes to the city clerk.

1794
03:11:08,435 --> 03:11:12,996
[SPEAKER_17]: And if the council wants to pretend we didn't send it, they can do that.

1795
03:11:13,436 --> 03:11:15,097
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, obviously they can't just

1796
03:11:16,206 --> 03:11:17,167
[SPEAKER_17]: write a check either.

1797
03:11:17,487 --> 03:11:20,050
[SPEAKER_17]: It's for their budget process.

1798
03:11:20,711 --> 03:11:31,983
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I just wanted to make sure this is this communication is coming both ways and we're seeing in a timely manner I think the way that city council and school committee can work together on this and of course the mayor's office.

1799
03:11:33,464 --> 03:11:41,068
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I was curious how this interfaces with our consent agenda where we are approving purchases.

1800
03:11:41,108 --> 03:11:48,131
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's in the capital plan and in the budget, we still need to approve the actual spending of the money when appropriated.

1801
03:11:48,611 --> 03:11:49,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1802
03:11:49,872 --> 03:11:59,297
[SPEAKER_05]: And then my very last thing, I also did not find any typos, but I think that phase seven, number one, I think the two sentences should each be their own item.

1803
03:12:01,658 --> 03:12:02,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Number one,

1804
03:12:03,461 --> 03:12:18,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Phase 7, 1, net school spending, and then the attachment should be a separate motion to amend it in that way, if I have to make a motion.

1805
03:12:21,531 --> 03:12:25,855
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a policy which requires two readings.

1806
03:12:27,757 --> 03:12:32,662
[SPEAKER_07]: So somebody can make a motion to approve the first reading and then this would go on the agenda again.

1807
03:12:33,622 --> 03:12:39,388
[SPEAKER_07]: Alternatively, somebody can motion to waive the first reading and then we can motion to approve the policy.

1808
03:12:41,351 --> 03:12:48,156
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to motion to waive the second reading this feels, but I was, you know what, I was on this, I was on the committee in the room when this was made.

1809
03:12:48,216 --> 03:12:53,380
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me turn it over to colleagues who are not on the strategic planning, capital planning subcommittee.

1810
03:12:55,802 --> 03:12:59,625
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to waive the first reading, like member Reinfeld mentioned.

1811
03:13:00,145 --> 03:13:04,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so there's a motion to waive the first reading by member Labate, yes?

1812
03:13:06,150 --> 03:13:07,411
[SPEAKER_07]: Second by member Branley.

1813
03:13:07,950 --> 03:13:09,131
[SPEAKER_17]: We actually have to do it the other way.

1814
03:13:09,151 --> 03:13:11,091
[SPEAKER_17]: We have to approve the second reading.

1815
03:13:11,391 --> 03:13:11,932
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, OK.

1816
03:13:12,272 --> 03:13:14,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a motion to approve the first reading?

1817
03:13:15,533 --> 03:13:17,014
[SPEAKER_17]: As amended by Member Rheinfeld.

1818
03:13:17,034 --> 03:13:17,534
[SPEAKER_17]: As amended, yes.

1819
03:13:17,554 --> 03:13:18,855
