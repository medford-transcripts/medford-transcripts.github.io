00:00:04,392 --> 00:00:10,435
[SPEAKER_09]: 16th regular meeting of the Medford City Council, April 19 2022 is called to order Mr. Clerk, please call the role.

2
00:00:10,575 --> 00:00:17,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Bears Council carabiello Council Collins Council night has informed us he's going to be absent tonight.

3
00:00:42,398 --> 00:00:52,764
[SPEAKER_09]: motions, orders and resolutions to to dash 316 offered by Councilor Scarpelli be it so resolved that the city council discuss a plan dealing with the future trash and recycling contract.

4
00:00:52,884 --> 00:00:53,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

5
00:00:54,405 --> 00:00:55,565
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Madam President.

6
00:00:57,834 --> 00:01:12,722
[SPEAKER_16]: We recently know that we just received information from the mayor's office that they're putting together a task force to look into contract trash removal contract that's up and coming.

7
00:01:14,443 --> 00:01:21,427
[SPEAKER_16]: This resolution was driven for the fact that conversations with people that really aren't truly

8
00:01:22,795 --> 00:01:44,213
[SPEAKER_16]: in tune with the recycling format and, and this came about and having conversation my neighbors is, we were looking at what we were, what people were throwing away and how many people don't really use as much trash, and the recycling bin being being overflowing with talking to maybe asking the city to do it twice.

9
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:49,097
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, doing it every week with the recycling, and the basic.

10
00:01:50,015 --> 00:01:58,240
[SPEAKER_16]: understanding of opening, it sounds bad, but we went through one of my neighbor's recycle bins and it was comical.

11
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,761
[SPEAKER_16]: They said, I'm a very good recycler.

12
00:02:00,781 --> 00:02:02,062
[SPEAKER_16]: I know exactly what I'm doing.

13
00:02:02,462 --> 00:02:15,630
[SPEAKER_16]: And then you notice that what the rules are and what people don't know in the city of Medford, at least people that really aren't in tune to it, that I gave them an example that they had a pizza box and the pizza box has said, yeah, it's empty.

14
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,352
[SPEAKER_16]: And I said, we'll see this grease spot on the pizza box.

15
00:02:19,275 --> 00:02:26,010
[SPEAKER_16]: Recycling, if you enter that into the recycling in Redemption Center, they take that and they void that whole barrel.

16
00:02:26,833 --> 00:02:30,895
[SPEAKER_16]: because that grease on that carton voids it.

17
00:02:30,935 --> 00:02:36,719
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's really trying to make sure that we have a way to educate all of our constituents.

18
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:53,749
[SPEAKER_16]: It's nice to think that everybody's in tune to recycling, but not understanding the true rules and what takes and what they don't take and understanding that if they go through something and they see a jar of peanut butter that hasn't been cleaned out,

19
00:02:55,163 --> 00:02:56,524
[SPEAKER_16]: that voids the whole barrel.

20
00:02:57,264 --> 00:03:06,728
[SPEAKER_16]: From what I've been told, it's not apples to apples as we look to true data when we go to the contract.

21
00:03:06,748 --> 00:03:16,152
[SPEAKER_16]: So the hope is, I saw the contact from the mayor's office and that we're starting, did anybody else get that?

22
00:03:17,252 --> 00:03:19,193
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so they're starting a task force.

23
00:03:19,853 --> 00:03:23,175
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think one of the biggest pieces we need is just,

24
00:03:24,355 --> 00:03:39,327
[SPEAKER_16]: Part of this is to make a resolution and put it out there that we ask for a process that we find a way to educate our constituents on the do's and don'ts of recycling.

25
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:53,038
[SPEAKER_16]: Something simple, bullet points, even a one-page tutorial which shows the basic concepts, because I don't think people understand for the fact that what the contract will look like

26
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:59,644
[SPEAKER_16]: moving into our next contract negotiations because it's going to be expensive.

27
00:03:59,844 --> 00:04:01,586
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to come back to the taxpayers.

28
00:04:01,626 --> 00:04:06,430
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just want to make sure that I brought that up this evening.

29
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:13,316
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm excited to see that the mayor is already moving forward with this and putting together a task force that's going to be addressing this.

30
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:17,659
[SPEAKER_16]: I just ask that, you know, really an education piece has to be in the forefront.

31
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,821
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you, Madam President.

32
00:04:19,841 --> 00:04:21,142
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

33
00:04:21,162 --> 00:04:21,823
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Collins.

34
00:04:22,623 --> 00:04:26,947
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you, Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on the agenda tonight.

35
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:30,431
[SPEAKER_11]: This is, you know, as we know from last week, an issue that I'm very passionate about as well.

36
00:04:31,068 --> 00:04:51,192
[SPEAKER_11]: know, and I think when we're talking about, you know, looking ahead to the opportunity to have a new contract with a waste and recycling hauler, you know, I think you raise a great point, which is that it's not just, you know, what they're doing on their end to make sure that we're recycling and disposing of waste with maximum efficiency, but also making sure that constituents have the knowledge that they need to really take full advantage of that.

37
00:04:51,252 --> 00:04:54,913
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think it's really important that, as you say, an education campaign be a part of

38
00:04:55,473 --> 00:04:56,434
[SPEAKER_11]: wherever we go from here.

39
00:04:56,474 --> 00:05:04,898
[SPEAKER_11]: So just be happy to support this tonight and really looking forward to getting more clarity on the scope of the Solid Waste Task Force from here on out.

40
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:05,578
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

41
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:07,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

42
00:05:07,739 --> 00:05:11,982
[SPEAKER_09]: And if I could from the chair, I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this up, particularly the recycling issue.

43
00:05:12,422 --> 00:05:21,627
[SPEAKER_09]: In the interim, despite cities and towns having vastly different policies as far as, you know, single stream, stuff like that, there is a website, RecycleSmartMA.org,

44
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,109
[SPEAKER_09]: That applies for the whole state.

45
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:27,351
[SPEAKER_09]: You can put in, as Councilor Scarpelli was saying, you can put in the item you're trying to recycle.

46
00:05:27,451 --> 00:05:38,800
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll tell you if it will be processed or not, because he's exactly right, that items contaminate, and just the way the process works, they will, you know, a whole load that you think you've got recycling is going to the trash.

47
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,182
[SPEAKER_09]: So I really thank you for bringing that up.

48
00:05:40,722 --> 00:05:43,744
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's recycledsmartma.org.

49
00:05:44,085 --> 00:05:50,290
[SPEAKER_09]: So I do have Councilor Scarpelli, a resolution asking the administration to develop a process for education regarding

50
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:52,572
[SPEAKER_09]: recycling and trash, please.

51
00:05:53,372 --> 00:06:14,932
[SPEAKER_16]: And it would be nice is to share this site this is this is perfect that it realizes that as part of the education piece I think that once, and it's not the people like I said it's not, it's not the person that's really invested in recycling, it's the common person that really doesn't understand, and, you know, when you look at the numbers when it comes down to it.

52
00:06:15,638 --> 00:06:20,420
[SPEAKER_16]: we're losing a lot in trash where people think they're doing the right thing.

53
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,380
[SPEAKER_16]: So education, I think is key.

54
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,421
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

55
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:26,202
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam President.

56
00:06:26,502 --> 00:06:27,342
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Scott is right.

57
00:06:27,442 --> 00:06:36,845
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember going to a meeting with waste management a couple of years ago and they actually had a list of the things and I realized all the stuff I was throwing out was really bad.

58
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:42,247
[SPEAKER_19]: So people think, you're right, people think they're doing a good job by just throwing it in.

59
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:44,188
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we know when our contract is up?

60
00:06:44,348 --> 00:06:45,348
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the chief of staff has said,

61
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,852
[SPEAKER_19]: with waste management and when we're going to be, or has it already gone out to bid?

62
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:58,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have, thank you, through you, President Morell, Councilor Caraviello.

63
00:06:58,475 --> 00:06:59,416
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have the date in front of me.

64
00:06:59,496 --> 00:07:01,777
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe we're about a year and a half out, but I can double check that.

65
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:02,958
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, I'm just curious.

66
00:07:02,998 --> 00:07:04,818
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know if we're coming up this year, but about a year and a half.

67
00:07:04,838 --> 00:07:06,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Roughly in a year and a half is my recollection.

68
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:07,360
[SPEAKER_19]: Somewhere around 2022.

69
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,580
[SPEAKER_19]: That's my recollection.

70
00:07:09,421 --> 00:07:09,701
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

71
00:07:10,841 --> 00:07:11,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion?

72
00:07:13,062 --> 00:07:13,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Comments from the public?

73
00:07:14,855 --> 00:07:20,299
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli as amended by Councilor Scarpelli and seconded by Councilor Collins.

74
00:07:22,661 --> 00:07:23,541
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

75
00:07:23,742 --> 00:07:25,022
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

76
00:07:25,283 --> 00:07:26,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

77
00:07:27,945 --> 00:07:28,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Tseng.

78
00:07:29,386 --> 00:07:35,930
[SPEAKER_12]: I just saw that there are a few people in the audience here and I believe on Zoom who are here to talk about the SOI, the statement of interest.

79
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,173
[SPEAKER_12]: I was wondering if I could motion to take this out of order.

80
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,682
[SPEAKER_09]: on the motion of Councilor Tseng to suspend the rules.

81
00:07:44,122 --> 00:07:58,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Paper number 22-three, two, four, seconded by councilor Caraviello.

82
00:07:59,049 --> 00:07:59,669
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor.

83
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:02,471
[SPEAKER_09]: I suppose the rules are suspended.

84
00:08:04,006 --> 00:08:10,290
[SPEAKER_09]: 22-324 to Honorable President Morell, Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council.

85
00:08:11,351 --> 00:08:27,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear President Morell and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves the Massachusetts School Building Authority, MSBA statement of interest on behalf of Medford High School that has been prepared by the Medford Public Schools for consideration for the MSBA's core program.

[SPEAKER_09]: The submission is in follow-up to the March 31st letter you received from the superintendent of schools.

87
00:08:33,364 --> 00:08:42,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Superintendent Maurice-Edouard-Vincent and Assistant Superintendent David Murphy will be on hand at your meeting should there be any questions or additional information that members would like to obtain.

88
00:08:43,112 --> 00:08:44,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your consideration.

89
00:08:46,915 --> 00:08:50,038
[SPEAKER_09]: MSBA required form of vote to submit statement of interest.

90
00:08:50,338 --> 00:08:50,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Resolved.

91
00:08:51,339 --> 00:09:02,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Having convened in an open meeting on April 19th, 2022 prior to the SOI submission closing date, the City Council of the City of Medford in accordance with its charter bylaws and ordinances

92
00:09:02,628 --> 00:09:07,972
[SPEAKER_09]: has voted to authorize Superintendent Maurice Edouard Vincent to submit to the Massachusetts School Building Authority.

93
00:09:08,393 --> 00:09:23,265
[SPEAKER_09]: The statement of interest formed dated April 2022 for Medford High School located at 49 Winthrop Street, which describes and explains the following deficiencies and the priority categories for which an application may be submitted to the Massachusetts School Building Authority in the future.

94
00:09:23,905 --> 00:09:44,676
[SPEAKER_09]: The Medford City Council hereby further specifically acknowledges that by submitting the statement of interest form, the Massachusetts School Building Authority in no way guarantees the acceptance or the approval of an application, the awarding of a grant, or any other funding commitments from the Massachusetts School Building Authority, or commits the city of Medford to filing an application for funding with the Massachusetts School Building Authority.

95
00:09:45,777 --> 00:09:46,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Chris Emeril.

96
00:09:47,057 --> 00:09:47,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Collins.

97
00:09:47,698 --> 00:09:49,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to waive the reading in lieu of a summary.

98
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:54,993
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to waive the reading for overview from the superintendent.

99
00:09:55,413 --> 00:09:56,955
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

100
00:09:56,995 --> 00:09:57,596
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

00:09:57,796 --> 00:09:58,838
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

102
00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:00,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

103
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:08,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Superintendent, if you'd like to give us an overview about what's being requested and what we'll be voting on tonight.

104
00:10:09,292 --> 00:10:12,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, President Morell and honorable body.

105
00:10:12,234 --> 00:10:20,058
[SPEAKER_10]: We thank you for your support of this MSBA application, our statement of interest.

106
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:27,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, our high school is in serious need of repair and renovation.

107
00:10:27,983 --> 00:10:32,605
[SPEAKER_10]: And we are hoping that with your support, we will be able to

108
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:47,631
[SPEAKER_10]: This time be approved by MSBA to be considered for renovation, or how can I say it, a new high school to be able to be built for us here in Medford.

109
00:10:49,674 --> 00:10:54,517
[SPEAKER_10]: It's our statement of interest and we are asking MSBA to approve us for the core program.

110
00:10:55,157 --> 00:11:00,881
[SPEAKER_10]: And we explained statutory priorities number five and number seven.

111
00:11:02,281 --> 00:11:11,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Those are the two key areas that we are requesting that MSBA consider for Medford High School's core program.

112
00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:15,289
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you have a question.

113
00:11:15,309 --> 00:11:19,411
[SPEAKER_09]: Statutory, unless you want to read what those two priorities are just for folks who might not have.

114
00:11:20,171 --> 00:11:41,999
[SPEAKER_10]: Statutory priority number five is regarding replace, renovate and modernize the school facility systems, including the roofs, windows, boilers, heating and ventilation to increase and improve energy conservation and decrease energy related costs in a school facility.

115
00:11:43,319 --> 00:11:47,582
[SPEAKER_10]: And statutory priority number seven was replacement of.

116
00:11:48,323 --> 00:11:57,870
[SPEAKER_10]: In addition to obsolete buildings in order to provide for a full range of programs, consistent with state and approved local requirements.

117
00:11:58,991 --> 00:11:59,311
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

118
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:00,352
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

119
00:12:01,673 --> 00:12:02,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Bears.

120
00:12:03,474 --> 00:12:06,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you Madam President Thank you Madam Superintendent for being here.

121
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:12,883
[SPEAKER_05]: I think everyone, really everyone in the community is aware of the condition of our high school.

122
00:12:12,943 --> 00:12:17,206
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably one of the public buildings that people visit the most in our city.

123
00:12:17,306 --> 00:12:24,392
[SPEAKER_05]: And having attended the school relatively recently, I can attest to some of the statements made in here.

124
00:12:25,593 --> 00:12:34,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, you know, this is, it's essential for us as a city to show a unified front, to move through the process and

125
00:12:36,308 --> 00:12:41,894
[SPEAKER_05]: make sure that the MSBA understands that we really are serious about this and it's something that we want to address.

126
00:12:42,314 --> 00:12:49,802
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hopeful tonight that we can move this forward, get our statement of interest in and make sure that this process

127
00:12:51,258 --> 00:12:54,440
[SPEAKER_05]: really gets off to the start that it needs to get off to.

128
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,281
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll certainly be voting for it tonight.

129
00:12:58,762 --> 00:13:03,905
[SPEAKER_05]: I would also say, you know, I think we know that this community has a lot of capital needs across the board.

130
00:13:04,685 --> 00:13:07,187
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not talking about how we're going to address all of those tonight.

131
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:11,029
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this is just a statement of interest to go to the MSBA, get a proposal in front of them.

132
00:13:11,749 --> 00:13:13,992
[SPEAKER_05]: start thinking about how much money that might cost.

133
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:28,165
[SPEAKER_05]: But I certainly think that this project and a number of other projects are due immediate consideration by the city and I'm hopeful that we can fund all of them promptly.

134
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:31,208
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you again for bringing this forward and I support it.

135
00:13:31,608 --> 00:13:32,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

136
00:13:37,347 --> 00:13:45,271
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam Superintendent, I know that this is something that I think we would be foolish not to support this evening.

137
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:57,316
[SPEAKER_16]: I think my biggest, my first question is, when would we know if we would be accepted or what we would be awarded if that's the case?

138
00:13:57,857 --> 00:13:59,017
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we have a timeline with that?

139
00:13:59,818 --> 00:14:02,379
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna ask Mr. Murphy to come give some of the specifics.

140
00:14:02,419 --> 00:14:02,759
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

141
00:14:02,799 --> 00:14:04,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Operations.

142
00:14:06,464 --> 00:14:07,966
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Dr. Edwards.

143
00:14:07,986 --> 00:14:09,167
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor, for your question.

144
00:14:10,269 --> 00:14:21,302
[SPEAKER_14]: There is not a very specific timeline, but I will quote one of the MSBA officials that I had the opportunity to speak with in the course of preparing the documentation before you this evening.

145
00:14:22,003 --> 00:14:26,428
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe her exact words, if you don't hear from us for a very long time, as in several months, don't panic.

146
00:14:27,341 --> 00:14:31,286
[SPEAKER_14]: And so sometimes it can be six months, sometimes it can be closer to a year.

147
00:14:31,726 --> 00:14:38,033
[SPEAKER_14]: It depends, frankly, on how many communities submit the statements of interest to try to get into the MSBA pipeline.

148
00:14:38,814 --> 00:14:42,298
[SPEAKER_14]: And then from that point, their sort of internal work begins.

149
00:14:42,338 --> 00:14:44,700
[SPEAKER_14]: So it would be measured in at least months.

150
00:14:44,981 --> 00:14:45,661
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, thank you.

151
00:14:46,342 --> 00:14:53,047
[SPEAKER_16]: And the reason why I bring that up is because of what cuts have is did say that it's definitely will be substantial.

152
00:14:54,428 --> 00:15:06,456
[SPEAKER_16]: And what we need to look at is not just the high school, but as we're moving forward other capital projects are other new schools that are new anymore that following disrepair themselves.

153
00:15:08,357 --> 00:15:15,584
[SPEAKER_16]: we can go on and on fire station, we could talk about, uh, different city buildings and, you know, other wishes and hopes.

154
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:30,757
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think that, um, not, I don't know how I don't want to put this, just I think to put, put the administration on notice that when it comes to money and that vote, we're all would hope we'd all vote unanimously to see where this goes tonight.

155
00:15:31,418 --> 00:15:33,540
[SPEAKER_16]: But as we move forward, I think it would be

156
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,441
[SPEAKER_16]: travesties that we don't have true numbers.

157
00:15:36,881 --> 00:15:38,942
[SPEAKER_16]: When you look at what else we have to do in the city.

158
00:15:40,223 --> 00:15:48,006
[SPEAKER_16]: Because the worst thing I want to see is, you know, pitting one group against the other what we need, we don't need this in our community.

159
00:15:48,446 --> 00:15:53,549
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think that having that capital plan in place so we can look at actual figures.

160
00:15:54,369 --> 00:16:00,172
[SPEAKER_16]: So we can make educated decisions when the time comes because I, I certainly don't want to deny it when it comes time for

161
00:16:01,212 --> 00:16:02,053
[SPEAKER_16]: talking about money.

162
00:16:02,813 --> 00:16:08,017
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't want to deny it because I don't know what the rest of the needs of the community going to be.

163
00:16:08,477 --> 00:16:09,958
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's all I would ask.

164
00:16:10,658 --> 00:16:15,782
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, not that it's a warning, but it's just a just to get the word out there.

165
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:16,622
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't want to be.

166
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:23,887
[SPEAKER_16]: The council says no on a money paper dealing with improvement of schools when we don't know what's happening with the rest of the community.

167
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:28,010
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would hope that, um, the administration really

168
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:49,005
[SPEAKER_16]: pays attention to that as we move forward because I, you know, I walked to the school the other day and my daughter goes there and my son graduated there and I coached there for years and it's just can't keep ahead of it, it's just a, it's, it's nobody's fault but times, and it's it's a mess so we know it has to be done there's a lot of

169
00:16:50,129 --> 00:16:51,611
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I think we're losing our kids now.

170
00:16:51,871 --> 00:17:02,202
[SPEAKER_16]: I think unfortunately we're losing a lot of kids to different school systems, whether it be Matt and on, you know, we will, we all thought just a few years ago, Matt and on was a school of the past.

171
00:17:02,302 --> 00:17:07,027
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, all of a sudden it's revitalized and we see droves of method kids leaving.

172
00:17:07,107 --> 00:17:11,532
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's one of the reasons why parents tell me they're leaving is because of you've seen Medford high school.

173
00:17:11,812 --> 00:17:12,273
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's just.

174
00:17:13,145 --> 00:17:13,846
[SPEAKER_16]: not the way to be.

175
00:17:13,926 --> 00:17:28,301
[SPEAKER_16]: I think, you know, we're very fortunate that we have great teachers, administrators at the high school that, uh, make me feel comfortable knowing that my daughter is getting a great education and she's gonna move forward for the next step chapter in her life on a solid footing.

176
00:17:28,661 --> 00:17:34,748
[SPEAKER_16]: But, um, you can't defend some of the things we see with some of the parents that lead for that reason.

177
00:17:34,808 --> 00:17:35,729
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um,

178
00:17:36,328 --> 00:17:47,878
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope my colleagues all support this and, like I said, when it comes down to the real thing and we start talking about real money that we need to find a way to make sure we fund these, these important issues, so thank you.

179
00:17:48,198 --> 00:17:48,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

180
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

181
00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:50,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

182
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,180
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

183
00:17:51,341 --> 00:17:52,482
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

184
00:17:52,682 --> 00:17:53,502
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for coming.

185
00:17:54,023 --> 00:18:01,729
[SPEAKER_19]: You know this is something you know I've supported many years many times in the past, sort of a Christmas list to the state.

186
00:18:05,724 --> 00:18:13,309
[SPEAKER_19]: If they were to come back with just one thing, what would your number one choice, what would your number one thing want to come back with?

187
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:21,594
[SPEAKER_19]: I know we asked for a lot of stuff, but what's the number one biggest concern that you have?

188
00:18:22,374 --> 00:18:31,840
[SPEAKER_10]: If MSBA was gonna give me one thing, it would be that they would approve our petition to go for the core program.

189
00:18:32,743 --> 00:18:49,200
[SPEAKER_10]: In the past, sometimes we've also attempted to go for the accelerated repair program where they just focus on a small section of the high school and repair a small section, but I think right now where the building is over 50 years old.

190
00:18:49,862 --> 00:19:00,410
[SPEAKER_10]: there are so many areas that are just starting to show their age and it wouldn't be to just go and focus on one area.

191
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:08,676
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to really fix the entire structure from bathrooms to leaks to the pipes bursting.

192
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:14,340
[SPEAKER_10]: So my wishlist would be that MSBA approves us for the core program.

193
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:15,601
[SPEAKER_10]: It takes a very long time.

194
00:19:16,222 --> 00:19:18,664
[SPEAKER_10]: So from this point to actually

195
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:22,898
[SPEAKER_10]: Having something done could take anywhere from eight to 10 years.

196
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:27,462
[SPEAKER_10]: There were many, many steps, but we do need to start somewhere.

197
00:19:27,502 --> 00:19:30,044
[SPEAKER_10]: And right now the building's 50 years old.

198
00:19:30,144 --> 00:19:35,329
[SPEAKER_10]: If it were to take a full 10 years, the building would then be 60 plus years old.

199
00:19:35,969 --> 00:19:44,197
[SPEAKER_10]: So that would be my wish that we would be approved, receive full approval from MSBA.

200
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:51,615
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, being being one of the first graduating classes out of that 50 years ago i'm showing my way.

201
00:19:53,336 --> 00:19:54,957
[SPEAKER_19]: But again, you know.

202
00:19:56,279 --> 00:20:00,462
[SPEAKER_19]: These are things that come up with every year and again, you know they're all they're all good things and.

203
00:20:01,008 --> 00:20:06,130
[SPEAKER_19]: They're all things that we need, and you probably left out a lot of stuff here that you need also, and I get it.

204
00:20:07,410 --> 00:20:09,811
[SPEAKER_19]: I say I've supported this in the past, and I will support it again tonight.

205
00:20:10,631 --> 00:20:19,534
[SPEAKER_19]: And like Councilor Scott said, we need to have a plan going forward there, so that even in the event that we get some money, we're gonna have to put money in too.

206
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:24,336
[SPEAKER_19]: This is not a freebie program, it's a loan.

207
00:20:25,316 --> 00:20:27,037
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think people need to understand that.

208
00:20:27,697 --> 00:20:35,885
[SPEAKER_10]: I think one other piece that people need to be aware of as well when we merge both high schools, the vocational side and the comprehensive side.

209
00:20:36,526 --> 00:20:43,853
[SPEAKER_10]: We now have about 45% enrollment on the vocational side of the house the CTE side.

210
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:50,880
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we currently have 15 programs there but there are other programs that we would like to offer.

211
00:20:51,621 --> 00:21:06,178
[SPEAKER_10]: to really give our students the greatest opportunities and again the limitations with the physical plant that would limit us from doing being able to offer some of additional programming for our students.

212
00:21:06,739 --> 00:21:09,121
[SPEAKER_10]: So I really feel like if MSBA

213
00:21:11,324 --> 00:21:27,816
[SPEAKER_10]: If your body approves our application and MSBA receives our statement of interest and allows us to move on to the next phase, it will allow us to really keep Medford out in front of the eight ball and really giving our students the greatest opportunities possible.

214
00:21:29,017 --> 00:21:29,317
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

215
00:21:30,678 --> 00:21:31,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

216
00:21:32,777 --> 00:21:36,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much for coming to the city council meeting to present.

217
00:21:36,842 --> 00:21:52,479
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, you know, being a recent student from there, I can attest to how great the education in the building is but I think a lot of people, they you know they see the building, and they don't realize how you know how great our education there is which leads to this problem of outflow.

218
00:21:53,745 --> 00:22:14,080
[SPEAKER_12]: And, and there's also the problem that you've mentioned in the statement of interest that, you know, with around a third of the classrooms not having natural light with the, what you describe as a bleak environment that students feel and I, as someone who's gone there recently I can definitely tell you that this is what most students there feel.

219
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,604
[SPEAKER_12]: the education that we could be giving to our Children.

220
00:22:19,245 --> 00:22:26,196
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and it sounds like, um, given the merger of the two schools to that there are, you know, there are significant, um,

221
00:22:26,962 --> 00:22:32,786
[SPEAKER_12]: differences in programming between what we could could be offering to our kids versus what we are currently offering to our kids.

222
00:22:34,027 --> 00:22:38,290
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I think these are important points to bring out in this meeting.

223
00:22:39,931 --> 00:22:47,897
[SPEAKER_12]: I also I just thought this statement of interest was very well put together and I wanted to quickly bring up some points that you guys have brought up so that

224
00:22:49,318 --> 00:22:51,399
[SPEAKER_12]: our residents of the city could also hear them.

225
00:22:52,500 --> 00:23:00,525
[SPEAKER_12]: But you mentioned that there's suboptimal ADA accessibility, fire safety, security, and technological aspects.

226
00:23:00,945 --> 00:23:14,413
[SPEAKER_12]: And with the security point, you explained that while the school is a safe environment, sometimes the age of the building does pose some challenges compared to what we could optimally be having in the building.

227
00:23:15,397 --> 00:23:31,305
[SPEAKER_12]: You've, you've discussed the environmental aspects of this, the challenge of the institution right now as well, where MHS is estimated to be expending 77% more energy than an average American school facility which is really shocking.

228
00:23:31,506 --> 00:23:32,126
[SPEAKER_08]: Unbelievable.

229
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:49,823
[SPEAKER_12]: And you've also mentioned that there are considerable challenges with respects to the cost and removal of hazardous material when it comes to air filtration, which we all I think now realize is such a priority for all of us.

230
00:23:50,364 --> 00:23:53,066
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think you really bring out the point in this report that

231
00:23:55,749 --> 00:24:02,293
[SPEAKER_12]: there are costs to the renovations that we need to keep this building in operation.

232
00:24:02,953 --> 00:24:18,022
[SPEAKER_12]: And so if we are constantly renovating bit by piece without a grand scheme, without a grand plan, which we would need estimates for, we could be spending more money in the future than if we actually had an actual plan.

233
00:24:19,222 --> 00:24:33,668
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that's another reason why I think absolutely approving this tonight is so important, right, because it actually is fiscally prudent, if we can get a bigger picture if we can get all the information that we can get from MSBA to know, you know,

234
00:24:35,408 --> 00:24:37,649
[SPEAKER_12]: to know what should we be spending on?

235
00:24:37,729 --> 00:24:38,909
[SPEAKER_12]: How much is it gonna cost?

236
00:24:40,209 --> 00:24:45,331
[SPEAKER_12]: And compared to not going on with this plan, what does that look like?

237
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:51,832
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think you did a really good, your office did a really great job with presenting that in this report.

238
00:24:52,692 --> 00:25:02,535
[SPEAKER_12]: You also have described wildly fluctuating temperatures and relocation of classrooms, I think, and malfunctioning HVAC systems.

239
00:25:02,615 --> 00:25:04,175
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you really capture

240
00:25:05,355 --> 00:25:12,800
[SPEAKER_12]: for I think all residents in the city, the real gravity of the situation in that building and the urgency of action.

241
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:18,343
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I just wanted to bring those points out because I thought this was very well put together.

242
00:25:18,363 --> 00:25:24,346
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think all of our residents deserve a chance to hear what you've put in this report.

243
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:25,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

244
00:25:26,207 --> 00:25:29,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you to the team as well who worked on putting everything together.

245
00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:30,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Murphy.

246
00:25:30,974 --> 00:25:32,135
[SPEAKER_10]: and all the others that worked.

247
00:25:32,895 --> 00:25:40,741
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, I think the report actually details many, many of the things that need addressing.

248
00:25:41,481 --> 00:25:45,704
[SPEAKER_10]: And the fact that the building is not air conditioned, and sometimes we have very hot summers.

249
00:25:46,245 --> 00:25:52,489
[SPEAKER_10]: There are a lot of things that our students graciously put up with, but we know it's not easy for them.

250
00:25:52,829 --> 00:25:58,133
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is our hope to give our students the best quality education

251
00:25:58,979 --> 00:26:07,324
[SPEAKER_10]: in the best facility possible if we are granted by MSBA and by your body to move forward.

252
00:26:08,004 --> 00:26:14,588
[SPEAKER_10]: So I humbly request your support with this statement of interest application.

253
00:26:15,609 --> 00:26:15,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

254
00:26:16,690 --> 00:26:17,390
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

255
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:18,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Dr. Edward-Vincent.

256
00:26:19,031 --> 00:26:20,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Any, all right, Councilor Bears.

257
00:26:20,837 --> 00:26:35,260
[SPEAKER_05]: Just an aside, Councilor Tseng reminded me of, and I think this is important for everyone to realize, you know, sweating through an AP physics test in lecture hall two or the MCAS or, you know, SATs, PSATs.

258
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:41,181
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, these are, there's documented studies about the impact of the environment on student outcomes directly.

259
00:26:41,381 --> 00:26:45,962
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if you can't sit through a test, that's gonna make it hard for you to take the test.

260
00:26:46,002 --> 00:26:48,703
[SPEAKER_05]: So just another reason to be supportive of this.

261
00:26:49,063 --> 00:26:49,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

262
00:26:51,310 --> 00:26:54,851
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion of Councilor Caraviello.

263
00:26:54,871 --> 00:26:59,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any further discussion from Councilors or would any members of the public like to speak?

264
00:26:59,892 --> 00:27:01,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

265
00:27:02,032 --> 00:27:04,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Just, I do have one letter to read into the record.

266
00:27:04,493 --> 00:27:08,593
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't see anyone who wants to speak in person, seeing on Zoom.

267
00:27:10,294 --> 00:27:14,995
[SPEAKER_09]: I do just have one letter from a resident to read into the record.

268
00:27:15,075 --> 00:27:16,495
[SPEAKER_09]: This is from Luke Prisner at 144th Street.

269
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:27,403
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear city councilors, I address you this evening to ask for unanimous support for Medford High School's application to the state's School Building Assistant Program via Statement of Interest, SOI.

270
00:27:27,923 --> 00:27:30,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Today's vote is about SOI priorities and community unity.

271
00:27:31,326 --> 00:27:37,610
[SPEAKER_09]: It should not be confused with other subjects such as tax levies or project specifics, neither of those is in play as a result of this vote.

272
00:27:38,151 --> 00:27:46,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Instead, the district working on behalf of thousands of Medford parents and residents ask each of you to endorse the priorities they've selected to highlight before the MSBA Board of Directors.

273
00:27:47,605 --> 00:27:56,708
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford's application will be one among probably 100 such applications to the MSBA this year, out of which only about a 10th are selected into the MSBA program.

274
00:27:57,228 --> 00:28:01,890
[SPEAKER_09]: Therefore, it's very important to show the MSBA that we in Medford are all united in this cause.

275
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:08,612
[SPEAKER_09]: The high school is now over 50 years old and fixing all of its problems on our own falls far beyond the current needs.

276
00:28:09,212 --> 00:28:10,353
[SPEAKER_09]: We need MSBA's help.

277
00:28:10,673 --> 00:28:17,175
[SPEAKER_09]: MSBA can only help school districts that compellingly state the case for need and urgency and are admitted into the MSBA program.

278
00:28:17,902 --> 00:28:26,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Selection is a game changer and may put Medford on a structured path in a several years long process to resolve our high school's woes, perhaps even in time for the graduating class of 2029.

279
00:28:26,508 --> 00:28:30,471
[SPEAKER_09]: The current SOI is Medford's third in the past five years.

280
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:35,415
[SPEAKER_09]: It is normal and common for a district to apply multiple times, making refinements along the way.

281
00:28:36,055 --> 00:28:42,579
[SPEAKER_09]: In 2018 the City Council endorsed the district's SOI priorities, but unfortunately the MSBA did not select Medford that year.

282
00:28:43,139 --> 00:28:48,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Then again in 2019 this process repeated the City Council support for SOI priorities, but the outcome was the same.

283
00:28:49,282 --> 00:28:53,405
[SPEAKER_09]: In between then and now the COVID-19 pandemic began disrupting normal activities starting in 2020.

284
00:28:54,602 --> 00:29:00,963
[SPEAKER_09]: Now in 2022, normal activities are resuming and the acuity of Medford High's need and urgency has grown.

285
00:29:01,684 --> 00:29:05,564
[SPEAKER_09]: As a community, we must act together and act quickly to re-engage on the SOI process.

286
00:29:05,764 --> 00:29:06,505
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the first step.

287
00:29:07,025 --> 00:29:13,346
[SPEAKER_09]: No money is committed and no decisions are made apart from the decision to ask the MSBA for support.

288
00:29:14,166 --> 00:29:15,587
[SPEAKER_09]: That is the real purpose of today's vote.

289
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:20,028
[SPEAKER_09]: Namely, do each of you agree that Medford High School needs either rehabilitation or renovation?

290
00:29:20,568 --> 00:29:22,008
[SPEAKER_09]: If you do, then please vote yay.

291
00:29:22,550 --> 00:29:25,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Many residents I've spoken with believe it is time, and we all hope you agree.

292
00:29:26,354 --> 00:29:28,657
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford High School's condition has not improved over time.

293
00:29:28,837 --> 00:29:34,664
[SPEAKER_09]: In many ways, the burdens on its old bones have increased, and the urgency with which we must act has never been greater.

294
00:29:35,184 --> 00:29:37,467
[SPEAKER_09]: I thank you for your thoughtful consideration on this matter.

295
00:29:37,527 --> 00:29:40,531
[SPEAKER_09]: Please unanimously endorse the district's SOI priorities today.

296
00:29:40,611 --> 00:29:41,732
[SPEAKER_09]: Best regards, Luke.

297
00:29:44,047 --> 00:29:52,233
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone else like to speak on the motion of Councilor Caraviello second by second bears.

298

00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:53,823
[SPEAKER_06]: If I may just speak generally on the next four items that were taken out of order.

331
00:31:54,363 --> 00:31:59,706
[SPEAKER_06]: These are candidates that are put forth before the city council for the city council's consideration.

332
00:32:00,367 --> 00:32:16,697
[SPEAKER_06]: We understand that there's a time sensitivity to this matter relating to establishing an elections commission so that the process can take place in a timely fashion as it relates to items that are upcoming in May and just procedurally to ensure that we have all of our ducks in a row for

333
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:18,606
[SPEAKER_06]: planning and

334
00:32:21,253 --> 00:32:25,334
[SPEAKER_06]: outlining the next election process, considering this is new for the city.

335
00:32:26,395 --> 00:32:47,924
[SPEAKER_06]: And so at this point, I don't have any specific comments for any specific candidates, but before the city council is our four candidates, which meet the criteria established by the mass general law relating to the breakdown between enrolled parties, and happy to answer any specific questions relating to specific candidates the best I can.

336

343
00:33:09,558 --> 00:33:11,860
[SPEAKER_19]: He's a person of good character and good moral flavor.

344
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:15,022
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think he's already on the board now.

345
00:33:16,415 --> 00:33:20,216
[SPEAKER_19]: but I think he would continue to make a good representative to the city.

346

347

547
00:46:20,038 --> 00:46:27,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Commissioner Karens and Commissioner McGivern at DPW, as well as staff over there, Solicitor Scanlon, who's guided us through this process as well.

548
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:37,910
[SPEAKER_05]: We did receive a letter today from Steven Pompeo, who I think was not able to make the committee of the whole, but did have a couple of suggestions.

549
00:46:39,231 --> 00:46:42,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to propose that we accept a couple of those.

550
00:46:42,333 --> 00:46:44,715
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do have two small amendments to make here.

551
00:46:46,176 --> 00:46:55,783
[SPEAKER_05]: In the last paragraph of the new section A, instead of six daylight hours, changed the word six to the word eight, so eight daylight hours.

552
00:46:57,284 --> 00:47:06,231
[SPEAKER_05]: That came up as essentially the idea is to make sure that if snow stops falling and someone's gone to work, that they can get home and have enough time to clear it.

553
00:47:07,552 --> 00:47:14,558
[SPEAKER_05]: And the second change is in the second to last paragraph of section C, which would be

554
00:47:15,693 --> 00:47:20,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Upon a third currently reads upon third violation during the term of ownership of the property.

555
00:47:20,336 --> 00:47:34,486
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just propose the amendment that we change the term of the ownership of the property to the phrase a five year period, so that people do have some sort of respite if you own a property for 70 years and you violated this three times.

556
00:47:35,327 --> 00:47:37,869
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I think you should have a second chance.

557
00:47:38,650 --> 00:47:40,011
[SPEAKER_05]: So those would be the two amendments.

558
00:47:40,672 --> 00:47:47,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I have forwarded that language to the city clerk as well for his records, but those are my proposed minutes I was second.

559
00:47:47,578 --> 00:47:49,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

560
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:50,541
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

561
00:47:52,023 --> 00:47:59,489
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for the work, but this is another ordinance that we can enforce.

562
00:48:00,178 --> 00:48:07,963
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, from the day I got elected in this council, 11 years ago, one of my biggest Ps was code enforcement officers.

563
00:48:08,623 --> 00:48:10,805
[SPEAKER_19]: I begged for one for, we only had one.

564
00:48:11,846 --> 00:48:21,812
[SPEAKER_19]: We got one, I think four years later, and then the person, so now we're down to one and a half persons in the code enforcement.

565
00:48:22,012 --> 00:48:23,793
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, Dennis McDonald was a good guy.

566
00:48:24,594 --> 00:48:25,815
[SPEAKER_19]: He's one person.

567
00:48:27,661 --> 00:48:29,622
[SPEAKER_19]: How much can we ask this guy to do?

568
00:48:30,162 --> 00:48:43,707
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I call him for a long time, and there's so many other glaring needs for code enforcement, not just this, but many other things that I feel are real important to me that one person or one and a half person just can't do.

569
00:48:46,024 --> 00:48:52,127
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a good proposal and I support it, but who enforces this?

570
00:48:52,527 --> 00:48:54,628
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, the police aren't gonna go out and force it.

571
00:48:55,108 --> 00:49:10,156
[SPEAKER_19]: And I say, Dennis is one guy and he's a helper, but the court enforcement office has to be stepped up and say, not just to enforce this ordinance, but there's multiple other ordinances that are flagrantly violated in the city.

572
00:49:10,196 --> 00:49:13,517
[SPEAKER_19]: And they say, we just don't have the ability to enforce them.

573
00:49:13,537 --> 00:49:14,458
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'll support this,

574
00:49:15,679 --> 00:49:24,887
[SPEAKER_19]: I would hope in the budget that there's at least another full-time officer to help support these ordinance that we keep on passing.

575
00:49:25,327 --> 00:49:33,554
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'd like to amend the paper that at budget time that we have at least a second full-time enforcement officer.

576
00:49:33,574 --> 00:49:35,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you like to add that as a B paper?

577
00:49:35,596 --> 00:49:37,718
[SPEAKER_19]: If you want to put that as a B paper, that's fine.

578
00:49:39,673 --> 00:49:40,153
[SPEAKER_09]: versus embarrassed.

579
00:49:40,334 --> 00:49:43,316
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President and Councilor Caraviello, I completely agree with you.

580
00:49:43,336 --> 00:49:48,240
[SPEAKER_05]: I think so much of what we can do to improve the conditions around the city or around our civil code.

581
00:49:49,261 --> 00:49:57,347
[SPEAKER_05]: I do wanna say that specifically as pertains to this, one of the recommendations, A, we added that the code enforcement office could choose their designee.

582
00:49:57,867 --> 00:50:04,092
[SPEAKER_05]: And we worked with them on the enforcement side of this very specifically to do the best practices that they felt were being effective.

583
00:50:04,413 --> 00:50:07,235
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, we need a lot more capacity in that office.

584
00:50:07,275 --> 00:50:08,396
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally agree with that.

585
00:50:09,296 --> 00:50:28,402
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing that we were able to get to is that potential, and I think the DPW and the building department have have agreed to this together at least they didn't are meeting that DPW would be able to be designees, as per this ordinance so that when they're out plowing if they see someone pushing stuff right back out into the street, they can go right after that.

586
00:50:28,742 --> 00:50:32,683
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not a solution to the question you asked I completely agree but it is, but I get.

587
00:50:33,743 --> 00:50:34,824
[SPEAKER_19]: Like I said, you know.

588
00:50:35,887 --> 00:50:37,528
[SPEAKER_19]: Our curb appeal in the city is horrible.

589
00:50:38,129 --> 00:50:43,753
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's because we don't have the people to enforce at least the flagrant violations.

590
00:50:44,134 --> 00:50:44,334
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

591
00:50:44,774 --> 00:50:45,475
[SPEAKER_05]: And I completely agree.

592
00:50:45,495 --> 00:50:58,405
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we think so much of what people bring to the city when it comes to needs is around the civil code and the distribution of the people who can actually are out there enforcing that is off balance.

593
00:50:58,445 --> 00:50:59,026
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you.

594
00:51:00,127 --> 00:51:01,508
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion from the council?

595
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:15,126
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to address the record, please?

596
00:51:15,426 --> 00:51:16,186
[SPEAKER_18]: Unfair at all.

597
00:51:17,187 --> 00:51:23,969
[SPEAKER_18]: Now I'm up there, you know, I've made a few blunders on the side, broken sidewalks here, broken kneecaps, the whole deal.

598
00:51:23,989 --> 00:51:29,591
[SPEAKER_18]: But my problem is, it's a great thing you're trying to do, but what about the seniors?

599
00:51:29,611 --> 00:51:30,571
[SPEAKER_18]: What about the people over 50?

600
00:51:30,991 --> 00:51:33,152
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't, they can't do it.

601
00:51:33,981 --> 00:51:35,182
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, it's an impossibility.

602
00:51:36,163 --> 00:51:43,428
[SPEAKER_18]: And the other problem is that it's almost impossible to do a good plumbing job, not because they don't do a good job.

603
00:51:44,049 --> 00:51:44,909
[SPEAKER_18]: There's too many cars.

604
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:50,554
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't care if you see a park over here or a park over there, there's too many cars.

605
00:51:50,954 --> 00:51:53,516
[SPEAKER_18]: So as a result, driveways get blocked in.

606
00:51:54,537 --> 00:51:56,438
[SPEAKER_18]: People can't get people to come and shovel.

607
00:51:57,319 --> 00:51:59,961
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it's really, it's really disgusting out there.

608
00:52:00,481 --> 00:52:01,402
[SPEAKER_18]: And I, I, um,

609
00:52:02,655 --> 00:52:06,336
[SPEAKER_18]: I've seen some of these, I think we have one or two bombardiers.

610
00:52:07,056 --> 00:52:08,076
[SPEAKER_18]: Here, these are the little ones.

611
00:52:08,096 --> 00:52:11,677
[SPEAKER_18]: They look like little riding tractors.

612
00:52:12,157 --> 00:52:14,777
[SPEAKER_18]: They have the V and they take it off the sidewalks.

613
00:52:15,157 --> 00:52:19,558
[SPEAKER_18]: But you know, there's a guy up in Princeton Street, Frank Torriani.

614
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:23,339
[SPEAKER_18]: They've had a tree stump there that's as big as this area here.

615
00:52:23,359 --> 00:52:24,139
[SPEAKER_18]: It's on a sidewalk.

616
00:52:24,179 --> 00:52:25,179
[SPEAKER_18]: He's 92 years old.

617
00:52:25,199 --> 00:52:26,159
[SPEAKER_18]: He's legally blind.

618
00:52:27,099 --> 00:52:30,520
[SPEAKER_18]: And I mean, these are things that need to be taken care of.

619
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:38,153
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, when I was a kid, they used to, we had a snowstorm, we used to go down to the MBTA down in Charlestown.

620
00:52:38,774 --> 00:52:42,276
[SPEAKER_18]: They used to hire you for the night to clear all the stations, the steps and everything.

621
00:52:42,936 --> 00:52:50,340
[SPEAKER_18]: And I know that there's kids out there that want to do this, but you got how many houses in the city and how many people can you put out there?

622
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:54,022
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, you know, even the National Guard couldn't do it on a night.

623
00:52:54,182 --> 00:53:01,786
[SPEAKER_18]: So I wish you would take consideration of the people that are out there in age, like myself, you know, I don't want to do it anymore.

624
00:53:03,165 --> 00:53:06,908
[SPEAKER_18]: But I see some of these people, they become shut-ins because they can't get out.

625
00:53:08,249 --> 00:53:14,873
[SPEAKER_18]: And then when they can get out, they have to be careful because you shovel, you melt it, and at the end of the day, it becomes ice again.

626
00:53:15,434 --> 00:53:17,055
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's a never-ending battle.

627
00:53:17,707 --> 00:53:20,411
[SPEAKER_18]: I think there's going to be a better way to help the people in the city of it.

628
00:53:21,071 --> 00:53:22,173
[SPEAKER_18]: Keep the sidewalks clear.

629
00:53:22,674 --> 00:53:24,436
[SPEAKER_18]: So, that's all I got to say right now.

630
00:53:24,616 --> 00:53:34,949
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. Thank you, ma'am President, being the same generation of this day Antonio I remember when the city used to hire the kids, and

631
00:53:36,852 --> 00:53:39,574
[SPEAKER_19]: they paid you and they took you around and you shoveled.

632
00:53:39,614 --> 00:53:41,436
[SPEAKER_19]: You shoveled our hydrants, you shoveled our things.

633
00:53:42,117 --> 00:53:45,820
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, maybe that's a plan we can look to going forward.

634
00:53:46,401 --> 00:53:53,508
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, when there's a snow emergency, the kids that want to work, we pay them a wage and, you know, maybe put them on a snow.

635
00:53:53,548 --> 00:53:57,431
[SPEAKER_19]: We have a couple of small buses and just drive around and do

636
00:53:58,505 --> 00:54:00,746
[SPEAKER_19]: all parts of the city like they used to do in the past.

637
00:54:01,426 --> 00:54:11,349
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know we don't have the equipment, but maybe that's a plan that we could look forward to for the high school kids, for them to make a couple of dollars and to alleviate this with the snow plan.

638
00:54:11,609 --> 00:54:19,731
[SPEAKER_19]: Listen, I do my yard and I do multiple other yards, but there are people that are in their 50s that just can't do it.

639
00:54:19,751 --> 00:54:21,352
[SPEAKER_19]: There were the medical conditions and all that.

640
00:54:21,712 --> 00:54:25,433
[SPEAKER_19]: And then I get the word from all the people, well, why don't you hire a kid?

641
00:54:26,594 --> 00:54:27,654
[SPEAKER_19]: I tell them, but where do you live?

642
00:54:28,722 --> 00:54:29,483
[SPEAKER_19]: They want to hire a kid.

643
00:54:29,603 --> 00:54:32,105
[SPEAKER_19]: I know kids, I say kids don't want to do that anymore.

644
00:54:32,125 --> 00:54:43,075
[SPEAKER_19]: But, but maybe if say if the high school develops a program with the DPW, when there's a snow emergency, for the kids to report down on the DPW, and they'll take them out there, let them shovel, go out and shovel.

645
00:54:43,376 --> 00:54:44,317
[SPEAKER_19]: It worked in the past.

646
00:54:44,357 --> 00:54:45,438
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know why it can't work again.

647
00:54:46,298 --> 00:54:47,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

648
00:54:47,159 --> 00:54:47,620
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Tsengh.

649
00:54:50,365 --> 00:54:52,687
[SPEAKER_12]: totally agree with all everything that's been said.

650
00:54:52,707 --> 00:54:55,889
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it'd be valuable for us to look at such a program again.

651
00:54:55,909 --> 00:55:08,359
[SPEAKER_12]: I also wanted to tell our residents that our city, I think when we have a snow storm, they usually do put out a list of 10-ish names and phone numbers that people can call.

652
00:55:08,459 --> 00:55:16,766
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, they're gonna be flooded with requests, but I think it could be a good idea to expand such a program to make it prominent on our website.

653
00:55:17,186 --> 00:55:19,348
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we also here have a,

654
00:55:20,128 --> 00:55:31,052
[SPEAKER_12]: know a question of miss you know mismatch we I think we have people who are willing to shovel for for others, willing to be paid by the, if the city's willing to pay them.

655
00:55:32,032 --> 00:55:34,773
[SPEAKER_12]: And then people who need help.

656
00:55:35,249 --> 00:55:37,190
[SPEAKER_12]: shoveling their backyards and their sidewalks.

657
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:59,717
[SPEAKER_12]: I think if we prioritize, this is something I mentioned during the council priorities meeting, but if we prioritize something like revamping the city website, I think this is something that we wanna be looking at is making sure that our city plays a more proactive role in matching service providers and people who need those services in the city.

658
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:02,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

659
00:56:02,451 --> 00:56:03,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

660
00:56:03,572 --> 00:56:05,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. de Antonio, thank you.

661
00:56:05,653 --> 00:56:25,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng, and this the next paper which I'll go over does go through some, you know this, what we just discussed was the ordinance within our authority the next, the next paper is a number of recommendations that we're making to the city regarding storm mobile, you know that we, we don't control dpw, we don't control the list of programs that Councilor carabiello suggested but we do recommend

662
00:56:26,525 --> 00:56:42,217
[SPEAKER_05]: a priority sidewalk program, bring more bombardiers in, clear more sidewalks, more community engagement, expansion of a paid shoveler program, the request that the mayor create some exemptions for certain persons, people with disabilities or elderly residents.

663
00:56:43,158 --> 00:56:52,585
[SPEAKER_05]: So a number of those questions are things that we have discussed extensively in subcommittee and that we are really pushing the administration to take under serious consideration.

664
00:56:54,302 --> 00:56:55,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

665
00:56:55,184 --> 00:56:56,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion from the Council?

666
00:56:56,928 --> 00:57:00,396
[SPEAKER_09]: I do see Martha Andres on Zoom.

667
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:03,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Martha, name and address for the record, please.

668
00:57:03,702 --> 00:57:04,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, thank you.

669
00:57:04,522 --> 00:57:05,503
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Martha Andrus.

670
00:57:05,623 --> 00:57:08,123
[SPEAKER_00]: I live at 45 Kilgore Avenue in Medford.

671
00:57:08,763 --> 00:57:12,084
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to speak in favor of this ordinance.

672
00:57:12,264 --> 00:57:25,928
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank the Councilor Bears and the other Councilors who've worked very hard on this and touched base with all of the city departments that would bear the responsibility for making it work.

673
00:57:27,403 --> 00:57:29,604
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we waited a long time.

674
00:57:30,945 --> 00:57:32,465
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard mention of the elderly.

675
00:57:32,485 --> 00:57:38,968
[SPEAKER_00]: I have seen people who try to walk from their apartment to CVS to buy food.

676
00:57:39,958 --> 00:57:49,888
[SPEAKER_00]: in West Medford and climbing over snow banks, people with walkers, people with canes because somebody decided not to shovel after the storm.

677
00:57:50,148 --> 00:58:02,260
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think if you think about the elderly and the disabled, having sidewalks that we can walk on after storm, eight hours after storm is not an unreasonable thing to ask.

678
00:58:02,916 --> 00:58:03,877
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it's a right.

679
00:58:06,180 --> 00:58:22,659
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do want to point out that I was very pleased to see that not only is there the ordinance, but there are some recommendations to the city about stepping up the community assistance program for shoveling for elderly and disabled homeowners.

680
00:58:24,888 --> 00:58:39,155
[SPEAKER_00]: and that there's a proposal to provide an exemption for people who, because of their physical condition, cannot shovel, and because of their income level, cannot afford to pay for shoveling.

681
00:58:40,235 --> 00:58:44,677
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all good things, and I think they'll make our city better in very meaningful ways.

682
00:58:44,797 --> 00:58:45,217
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

683
00:58:45,237 --> 00:58:47,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Martha.

684
00:58:47,799 --> 00:58:48,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion?

685
00:58:50,662 --> 00:58:53,083
[SPEAKER_09]: We will take the B paper from Councilor Caraviello first.

686
00:58:53,163 --> 00:58:59,185
[SPEAKER_09]: So the B paper is to request the administration allocate more funding for additional code enforcement officers.

687
00:59:01,566 --> 00:59:04,427
[SPEAKER_09]: So on the motion of Councilor Caraviello for the B paper, seconded by?

688
00:59:04,447 --> 00:59:04,988
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

689
00:59:05,828 --> 00:59:06,528
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Collins.

690
00:59:07,689 --> 00:59:08,369
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

691
00:59:08,389 --> 00:59:08,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

692
00:59:08,809 --> 00:59:09,990
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

693
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:11,310
[SPEAKER_09]: B paper passes.

694
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:16,212
[SPEAKER_09]: On the main paper, on the motion of Vice President Bears, seconded by?

695
00:59:16,232 --> 00:59:18,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion for approval of the first reading.

696
00:59:19,798 --> 00:59:29,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion of vice and bears to approve a first reading as amended seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

697
00:59:29,981 --> 00:59:31,061
[SPEAKER_02]: First reading as amended.

698
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:32,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Bears.

699
00:59:33,101 --> 00:59:33,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

700
00:59:34,702 --> 00:59:36,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Collins.

701
00:59:36,962 --> 00:59:37,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

702
00:59:37,723 --> 00:59:38,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight is absent.

703
00:59:39,063 --> 00:59:39,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

704
00:59:40,063 --> 00:59:40,303
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

705
00:59:41,144 --> 00:59:41,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Tseng.

706
00:59:41,864 --> 00:59:42,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

707
00:59:42,444 --> 00:59:43,004
[SPEAKER_02]: President Morell.

708
00:59:43,284 --> 00:59:43,484
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

709
00:59:43,684 --> 00:59:46,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Six in the affirmative one absent the motion passes.

710
00:59:47,715 --> 01:00:10,877
[SPEAKER_09]: 22-319 offered by vice president bears Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Tseng that the City Council public works utility subcommittee chair vice president bears members Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Tseng recommendations to the city administration regarding snow removal and president motion to waive the reading for a summary by the motion of ice and bears to waive the reading for a summary by the chair second by second.

711
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:12,459
[SPEAKER_09]: answer saying all those in favor.

712
01:00:12,479 --> 01:00:15,342
[SPEAKER_09]: I suppose the motion passes.

713
01:00:15,762 --> 01:00:17,644
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

714
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:23,621
[SPEAKER_05]: As I said, these are the recommendations of policy recommendations to the city administration regarding snow removal.

715
01:00:24,722 --> 01:00:34,804
[SPEAKER_05]: First one is on plowing and snow removal practices, recommending an improvement to plowing practices to avoid the dumping of snow and ice on sidewalks and corner crosswalks.

716
01:00:36,205 --> 01:00:41,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Second is discretion for the code enforcement officer.

717
01:00:41,326 --> 01:00:44,567
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of this does fall under administrative discretion.

718
01:00:46,027 --> 01:00:47,028
[SPEAKER_05]: The third one is

719
01:00:48,708 --> 01:00:52,613
[SPEAKER_05]: basically that it's essential that even if there's discretion sidewalks do need to be cleared.

720
01:00:53,314 --> 01:01:03,968
[SPEAKER_05]: So recommending a creation of a policy to ensure that a sidewalk corner or crosswalk that's encumbered by snow or ice due to plowing or snow moving is promptly cleared as quickly as possible.

721
01:01:05,333 --> 01:01:17,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Second recommendation is on a priority sidewalk snow removal program we had extensive discussions in 2020 and 2021 on this including the creation of a list of priority streets that could be cleared.

722
01:01:18,287 --> 01:01:21,730
[SPEAKER_05]: We believe that this would really be incredibly helpful for connectivity.

723
01:01:22,932 --> 01:01:25,915
[SPEAKER_05]: We do know that cost is a barrier but we think that given the city's

724
01:01:26,535 --> 01:01:35,919
[SPEAKER_05]: a snow and ice account that, you know, this should be a serious priority for the administration to implement a priority sidewalk snow removal program.

725
01:01:37,260 --> 01:01:39,461
[SPEAKER_05]: The third recommendation is on community engagement.

726
01:01:39,981 --> 01:01:46,584
[SPEAKER_05]: First, recommending clear and consistent snow removal information be distributed using all communications tools available to the city.

727
01:01:49,458 --> 01:01:55,242
[SPEAKER_05]: Second, a single municipal point person or tool, for example, code enforcement or see quick fix.

728
01:01:55,482 --> 01:02:03,267
[SPEAKER_05]: I do know that code enforcement is now using see quick fix as kind of a database, but where residents can make reports or request assistance.

729
01:02:04,768 --> 01:02:14,755
[SPEAKER_05]: The administration has expanded some efforts regarding the volunteer and paid shovelers, but I think as Councilor Caraviello noted, that could be significantly expanded and we request that.

730
01:02:15,903 --> 01:02:20,949
[SPEAKER_05]: Fourth is regarding exemptions, noting that some communities have created exemption lists for certain people.

731
01:02:20,969 --> 01:02:32,584
[SPEAKER_05]: We suggest that the administration explore this policy, and also that if they were to implement exemptions that they have a policy to make sure that those sidewalks are still able to be cleared whether that be

732
01:02:33,485 --> 01:02:36,387
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what Councilor Caraviello was discussing or something else.

733
01:02:37,308 --> 01:02:41,332
[SPEAKER_05]: And finally, enforcement coordination between DPW and code enforcement.

734
01:02:42,473 --> 01:02:52,581
[SPEAKER_05]: We did have a discussion on March 23 2022 that coordination is essential to making sure that if snow is being pushed back out into the street after a street has been cleared.

735
01:02:53,298 --> 01:02:55,680
[SPEAKER_05]: that the DPW can take a look at that.

736
01:02:55,700 --> 01:03:06,549
[SPEAKER_05]: The building commissioner and DPW commissioner discussed making members of the DPW designees for the purposes of enforcement of this normal ordinance, and we support these coordination efforts.

737
01:03:07,910 --> 01:03:11,854
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would move to approve this item and send it to the city administration.

738
01:03:12,714 --> 01:03:13,695
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Vice President Ferris.

739
01:03:13,775 --> 01:03:15,376
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion from the council?

740
01:03:15,396 --> 01:03:19,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Any discussion from members of the public?

741
01:03:22,064 --> 01:03:26,794
[SPEAKER_09]: on the motion of vice-President Bears to approve the recommendations and send it to the administration.

742
01:03:26,934 --> 01:03:28,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Councilor Tseng.

743
01:03:29,620 --> 01:03:30,321
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

744
01:03:30,341 --> 01:03:31,003
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

745
01:03:31,023 --> 01:03:32,005
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

746
01:03:32,305 --> 01:03:33,167
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

747
01:03:35,673 --> 01:03:57,092
[SPEAKER_09]: dash 320 offered by Councilor Collins, be it so resolved by the Metric City Council that the subcommittee on zoning planning and development meet with the economic development director city solicitor and other relevant city staff to discuss current ordinances and licensing rules that regulate the conditions under which restaurants bars and other establishments may open in Medford squares and business districts.

748
01:03:57,885 --> 01:04:08,607
[SPEAKER_09]: be a further resolve of this discussion be used to explore potential amendments to ordinances and licensing rules that would allow more nightlife recreation and dining options to flourish in our city, sir Collins.

749
01:04:09,272 --> 01:04:34,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President Morell so pretty self explanatory this resolution is just meant to, you know, begin an investigation in subcommittee, you know, with working with members of our business community with the director of economic development to investigate the work that the city and the city council can do to accelerate the growth of our, our downtowns are many squares our business districts, you know, as I think everybody would agree we have some incredible options for

750
01:04:34,528 --> 01:04:40,571
[SPEAKER_11]: for dining, for recreation, for nightlife throughout Medford Square, South Medford Square, West Medford.

751
01:04:41,152 --> 01:04:48,295
[SPEAKER_11]: But at the same time, one of the things that I hear repeatedly from constituents is, you know, how can we take better advantage of our downtowns?

752
01:04:48,316 --> 01:04:50,457
[SPEAKER_11]: How can we take better advantage of Medford Square?

753
01:04:50,477 --> 01:04:57,921
[SPEAKER_11]: How can we make it so Medford Square is really more of a destination for people within our community and also for people from outside of our community?

754
01:04:58,981 --> 01:05:05,488
[SPEAKER_11]: I think people would like to see more and different options and really build upon the wonderful base of businesses that we do have in many of our business districts.

755
01:05:07,450 --> 01:05:18,621
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, so there's a lot to do in the project of transforming our business districts into, you know, even more vibrant and bustling squares obviously that takes into account transportation, it takes into account

756
01:05:19,221 --> 01:05:23,602
[SPEAKER_11]: cycling and pedestrian access, parking, a whole host of issues.

757
01:05:23,662 --> 01:05:41,986
[SPEAKER_11]: This resolution is not meant to get into all of those, but rather just to begin a conversation with the Director of Economic Development, with our business community about what changes this body could potentially investigate, consider, potentially act on to make it easier for new establishments to start and to thrive in Medford.

758
01:05:42,006 --> 01:05:43,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

759
01:05:43,967 --> 01:05:44,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello,

760
01:05:45,207 --> 01:05:45,807
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam President.

761
01:05:45,827 --> 01:05:46,047
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

762
01:05:46,227 --> 01:05:49,348
[SPEAKER_19]: The answer is very simple.

763
01:05:50,149 --> 01:05:50,749
[SPEAKER_19]: It's called people.

764
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:55,630
[SPEAKER_19]: Businesses come where there's people.

765
01:05:56,431 --> 01:06:00,652
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't have enough people here to draw more businesses in.

766
01:06:01,792 --> 01:06:03,933
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, it's called density.

767
01:06:04,643 --> 01:06:12,752
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a reason Somerville and Cambridge have hundreds and hundreds of residents, because there's people there and businesses want to come where there's people.

768
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:19,198
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been on so many meetings with the city and over the years, and again, we're not growing.

769
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:22,602
[SPEAKER_19]: That's how you get business here.

770
01:06:23,042 --> 01:06:24,724
[SPEAKER_19]: You have to increase your population.

771
01:06:25,045 --> 01:06:26,246
[SPEAKER_19]: You gotta bring people there.

772
01:06:27,428 --> 01:06:30,889
[SPEAKER_19]: Gotta allow developments for more people to move into the squares.

773
01:06:31,589 --> 01:06:33,289
[SPEAKER_19]: Not just Medford Square, but all the areas.

774
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:39,271
[SPEAKER_19]: Sit down with the business owners and say, listen, would you like to put a couple of more floors onto your building?

775
01:06:40,551 --> 01:06:42,171
[SPEAKER_19]: Urban living is the way to go now.

776
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:48,853
[SPEAKER_19]: But again, we've got apartment buildings that we're fighting that would bring a couple of thousand people here.

777
01:06:49,553 --> 01:06:50,753
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's what businesses want.

778
01:06:50,993 --> 01:06:54,354
[SPEAKER_19]: They want to come with his people and we're not doing anything to

779
01:06:56,318 --> 01:06:58,981
[SPEAKER_19]: bring people here to bring the business.

780
01:06:59,001 --> 01:07:02,205
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the very simple answer to this.

781
01:07:02,785 --> 01:07:09,953
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, it's something I've been preaching for many years here and that's the really answer.

782
01:07:10,994 --> 01:07:11,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Cabrera.

783
01:07:12,716 --> 01:07:14,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion from the council?

784
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:15,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Members of the public?

785
01:07:17,518 --> 01:07:23,388
[SPEAKER_09]: on the motion of Councilor Collins to send this to the subcommittee on planning and development seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

786
01:07:23,448 --> 01:07:24,109
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

787
01:07:24,129 --> 01:07:25,491
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

788
01:07:25,751 --> 01:07:26,653
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

789
01:07:26,673 --> 01:07:28,596
[SPEAKER_09]: 22-321 offered by Councilor Collins.

790
01:07:30,912 --> 01:07:43,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it so resolved by the Metro City Council that the subcommittee on housing need to discuss a proposed condo conversion ordinance so as to improve stability for tenants in the event of large rental apartment buildings being sold as condominiums.

791
01:07:44,303 --> 01:07:51,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it further resolved that the subcommittee invite the city solicitor and staff from the Office of Planning, Development and Sustainability to join this discussion.

792
01:07:51,288 --> 01:07:51,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Collins.

793
01:07:52,745 --> 01:07:53,705
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President real.

794
01:07:54,746 --> 01:08:07,672
[SPEAKER_11]: So over the past few weeks we've had discussions in these chambers about how the housing market is playing out in Medford ways that is displacing residents of Medford, and what the city can do to better protect

795
01:08:08,052 --> 01:08:18,278
[SPEAKER_11]: its residents and specifically tenants, you know, and the need to target specific protections at, you know, buildings that are held by commercial corporate landlords.

796
01:08:19,018 --> 01:08:30,745
[SPEAKER_11]: So the ordinance that I'm hoping that we can have the chance to discuss in subcommittee would be targeted at codifying protections specifically for tenants of large commercially owned apartment buildings in the event that they're converted into condominiums.

797
01:08:31,245 --> 01:08:36,869
[SPEAKER_11]: That is the gist of a condo conversion ordinance, which exists in many communities

798
01:08:37,729 --> 01:08:38,810
[SPEAKER_11]: throughout the state.

799
01:08:39,891 --> 01:08:47,656
[SPEAKER_11]: For example, everywhere from Amherst to Brookline, Malden, Marlborough, Somerville has one, Salem is working on one right now.

800
01:08:47,856 --> 01:09:05,548
[SPEAKER_11]: These exist in places where there's an imperative to make sure that in the event of a large building being converted from a rental into a condo, that the people that are living there just have appropriate, reasonable protections for having a safe and stable off-ramp from that living situation.

801
01:09:06,068 --> 01:09:06,948
[SPEAKER_11]: into their next one.

802
01:09:07,028 --> 01:09:19,472
[SPEAKER_11]: So like many of the housing measures, like many of the tenant protection measures that we've discussed in this council, this is the type of thing that can be tailored to suit this community, can be tailored to suit the needs of our city.

803
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:27,595
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm really looking forward to beginning that conversation in subcommittee with some of the very knowledgeable housing staff that we are lucky to have here in Medford.

804
01:09:27,635 --> 01:09:32,256
[SPEAKER_11]: So I humbly ask for my fellow councilors support in beginning to consider this.

805
01:09:32,756 --> 01:09:33,136
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

806
01:09:33,977 --> 01:09:34,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

807
01:09:36,488 --> 01:09:37,969
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion from the council?

808
01:09:39,109 --> 01:09:39,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion approved.

809
01:09:41,030 --> 01:09:45,831
[SPEAKER_09]: Members of the public, on the motion of Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

810
01:09:46,272 --> 01:09:46,992
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

811
01:09:47,332 --> 01:09:47,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Aye.

812
01:09:47,872 --> 01:09:48,572
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

813
01:09:48,632 --> 01:09:52,334
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

814
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,334
[SPEAKER_09]: 22-322, offered by Vice President Bears.

815
01:09:54,434 --> 01:09:57,336
[SPEAKER_09]: Rules of the City Council, Medford, Massachusetts.

816
01:09:57,436 --> 01:09:58,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Last update, April 19th, 2022.

817
01:09:58,936 --> 01:10:00,977
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Bears.

818
01:10:01,037 --> 01:10:03,778
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam President, motion to waive the reading for a summary?

819
01:10:04,502 --> 01:10:05,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam President.

820
01:10:20,008 --> 01:10:28,254
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an item that we worked on for several months at this point, coming out of the Ordinances and Rules Subcommittee.

821
01:10:30,036 --> 01:10:34,539
[SPEAKER_05]: This, basically, I'll try to summarize it as best as I can.

822
01:10:34,579 --> 01:10:44,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, it's essentially a review of the existing council rules, the creation of a table of contents and pursuant sections of the rules.

823
01:10:46,071 --> 01:10:47,252
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll just say this off the top.

824
01:10:48,033 --> 01:10:58,366
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the consensus items that we all agreed on and committee of the whole, we have separated out a discussion of the city council's meetings for further review so that will happen in the future.

825
01:10:58,386 --> 01:11:03,292
[SPEAKER_05]: This vote and these change will not affect the current meeting schedule of the city council.

826
01:11:03,892 --> 01:11:10,515
[SPEAKER_05]: What it does do, as I said, first it adds a table of contents to the council rules which had not existed previously.

827
01:11:10,535 --> 01:11:13,937
[SPEAKER_05]: There are a number of technical language change and updates.

828
01:11:14,898 --> 01:11:21,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Previously this set of the council rules, you know, had different names for Councilors versus members.

829
01:11:22,201 --> 01:11:24,222
[SPEAKER_05]: So just making sure that all of that is consistent.

830
01:11:26,203 --> 01:11:28,985
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, a number of other just updates and kind of

831
01:11:30,466 --> 01:11:41,151
[SPEAKER_05]: bringing the language into modern readable times, some of it was a little archaic and arcane, maybe pulled directly from Robert's rules or from some other parliamentary procedures and it's kind of hard to understand or parse.

832
01:11:42,311 --> 01:11:47,594
[SPEAKER_05]: Third thing, third major thing is a streamlines the order of business, it takes a lot of the items that we all

833
01:11:48,574 --> 01:11:57,301
[SPEAKER_05]: have consensus on congratulations, condolences, announcements, informational items, and kind of puts them in a single section for us to take a look at up front.

834
01:11:58,703 --> 01:12:05,628
[SPEAKER_05]: Fourth is there actually was no council rule or anything discussing public participation, it was one sentence and another rule.

835
01:12:06,128 --> 01:12:12,734
[SPEAKER_05]: This creates a council rule on public participation, organizing that and making it clear what people, you know,

836
01:12:13,534 --> 01:12:24,622
[SPEAKER_05]: exactly the rules are but I think, as we all discussed maintaining the intent of this council that the public can come and speak to us on any issue that they wish to speak to us on.

837
01:12:27,452 --> 01:12:38,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Five is that it changes the public hearing process as people who have been before this council know we asked members of the public to tell us whether they support or oppose a project before we explain the project.

838
01:12:39,216 --> 01:12:43,218
[SPEAKER_05]: So, this would change that process and make that more clear.

839
01:12:44,438 --> 01:13:03,325
[SPEAKER_05]: Six major changes, just requesting additional information and time for considerations of papers that are put before us by the mayor, particularly on financial matters, as well as requesting, you know, a written report of, you know, a written version of whatever updates or requests we're getting from the council in addition to maybe a verbal presentation.

840
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:12,089
[SPEAKER_05]: And then seventh, there's, I think the last major change is just that the president would review the agenda with the clerk prior to the posting of the agenda.

841
01:13:13,123 --> 01:13:18,567
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's anything I missed, I'd certainly be happy to hear from my fellow Councilors.

842
01:13:21,950 --> 01:13:24,432
[SPEAKER_16]: No, thank you, Council President.

843
01:13:24,752 --> 01:13:25,412
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Council.

844
01:13:26,033 --> 01:13:31,697
[SPEAKER_16]: Vice President Baez, you summarized that in depth and appreciate it.

845
01:13:31,737 --> 01:13:40,244
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that again, just to reiterate, unlike what has happened on the school committee side, that the word that keeps coming back out there is that

846
01:13:40,879 --> 01:13:43,762
[SPEAKER_16]: We're changing the rules to stifle our constituents.

847
01:13:43,802 --> 01:13:44,622
[SPEAKER_16]: That's not the case.

848
01:13:45,823 --> 01:13:47,605
[SPEAKER_16]: Reiterate what Councilor Beall said.

849
01:13:48,206 --> 01:14:04,420
[SPEAKER_16]: This will always have a forum here in this chambers for this council that any participant, any resident of the city can come to that podium and speak on any issue that they think is prudent or they need that to get off their chest.

850
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:05,461
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that was important.

851
01:14:06,934 --> 01:14:23,175
[SPEAKER_16]: The policy is still in place where it's not debatable, but there's a process where if a community member does want something on the agenda to speak and discuss on that agenda we can do that so this is definitely a venue that

852
01:14:24,050 --> 01:14:27,251
[SPEAKER_16]: is still for the people and have options for the people to speak.

853
01:14:27,291 --> 01:14:35,973
[SPEAKER_16]: So other than that, to reiterate the other piece that was out there that has some debate is the amount of meetings per month.

854
01:14:36,733 --> 01:14:49,296
[SPEAKER_16]: I know that there is some debate, whether it's two meetings or bi-weekly meetings, excuse me, bi-weekly meetings or weekly meetings, I still think, and that's still on the agenda.

855
01:14:49,336 --> 01:14:53,717
[SPEAKER_16]: So other than that, I see everything is in place and I would move for approval.

856
01:14:55,298 --> 01:14:58,341
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion on the council council.

857
01:14:58,361 --> 01:14:59,142
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

858
01:14:59,162 --> 01:15:02,485
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, like I was in favor of most of the stuff on there.

859
01:15:02,846 --> 01:15:13,256
[SPEAKER_19]: A lot of it didn't get but I do feel that we changing from weekly to bi weekly is something I'm not in favor of at all.

860
01:15:13,796 --> 01:15:14,997
[SPEAKER_19]: I think all it does is.

861
01:15:16,762 --> 01:15:21,647
[SPEAKER_19]: It makes the meetings longer, and it makes people wait.

862
01:15:22,147 --> 01:15:28,512
[SPEAKER_19]: So now at 1030, we're sitting here discussing it, and people have been waiting all night, saying, I can't wait up anymore.

863
01:15:28,953 --> 01:15:33,216
[SPEAKER_19]: I think this is just something to stable the people from coming in.

864
01:15:33,857 --> 01:15:36,479
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel that we should keep the meetings the way they've been.

865
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:39,422
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, I know we said, well, we need an extra one.

866
01:15:39,442 --> 01:15:40,223
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll have an extra one.

867
01:15:40,963 --> 01:15:43,325
[SPEAKER_19]: All that does is it's going to cause confusion.

868
01:15:44,890 --> 01:15:52,497
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, it's everything else here, but I just don't agree with changing from the system we have that's worked forever.

869
01:15:53,158 --> 01:15:58,243
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is what the people are comfortable with to a bi-weekly meeting.

870
01:15:58,263 --> 01:16:04,228
[SPEAKER_19]: So other than that, I support just about everything else on this agenda, on this ordinance.

871
01:16:05,389 --> 01:16:06,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

872
01:16:06,831 --> 01:16:08,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion from the council?

873
01:16:09,436 --> 01:16:10,497
[SPEAKER_09]: if I may.

874
01:16:10,597 --> 01:16:13,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to, so tonight we wouldn't change the meetings.

875
01:16:13,638 --> 01:16:15,079
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to make that clear for everybody.

876
01:16:15,099 --> 01:16:21,522
[SPEAKER_05]: This vote tonight, we're talking about the meetings in the future committee, the whole, those changes are not included in what we're updating tonight.

877
01:16:21,622 --> 01:16:25,304
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm certainly willing to have, have that further debate.

878
01:16:25,344 --> 01:16:33,048
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that there's, you know, I think a lot of options that we could potentially entertain, but tonight's vote would not change the meeting schedule.

879
01:16:33,908 --> 01:16:35,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

880
01:16:35,149 --> 01:16:41,111
[SPEAKER_09]: And barring any unforeseen circumstances, the next committee of the whole on that will be next Tuesday at 6pm.

881
01:16:41,652 --> 01:16:45,413
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll discuss those, the few contested items that are left.

882
01:16:53,877 --> 01:16:56,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion from the Council or members of the public?

883
01:16:58,039 --> 01:16:59,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address for the record, please.

884
01:17:00,527 --> 01:17:02,188
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening, thank you for allowing me to speak.

885
01:17:02,268 --> 01:17:04,890
[SPEAKER_17]: John Petrella, 61 Locust Street, Method Mass.

886
01:17:05,370 --> 01:17:10,073
[SPEAKER_17]: I just wanna quickly reiterate what Councilor Caraviello said.

887
01:17:10,113 --> 01:17:17,598
[SPEAKER_17]: I know we're not voting on it tonight, but change can be good, but I don't see a reason.

888
01:17:18,558 --> 01:17:19,919
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the way it's always been.

889
01:17:19,939 --> 01:17:22,881
[SPEAKER_17]: And I agree with him.

890
01:17:22,941 --> 01:17:27,504
[SPEAKER_17]: Anything that has to do with stifling the public is just not a good thing.

891
01:17:28,192 --> 01:17:33,873
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would hope when the time comes to vote for that, you think about the people that put you here, that's all.

892
01:17:35,413 --> 01:17:38,614
[SPEAKER_17]: The other thing I just wanna, and this is only, it's just me.

893
01:17:40,394 --> 01:17:47,275
[SPEAKER_17]: Rule 16 on the public participation, basically because of what's going on with the school committee.

894
01:17:47,995 --> 01:17:50,896
[SPEAKER_17]: It's very disheartening how they're shutting us down.

895
01:17:51,436 --> 01:17:53,156
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, completely shutting us down.

896
01:17:53,716 --> 01:17:55,197
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just not right.

897
01:17:57,672 --> 01:18:18,629
[SPEAKER_17]: So I know this is the rule, I know nothing was changed, it's always been this way, but the rule is all petitions filed by members of the public shall either be sponsored by a member or reviewed by the city clerk and council president prior to placement on the public participation section of the agenda.

898
01:18:18,729 --> 01:18:19,609
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's gonna stay?

899
01:18:21,431 --> 01:18:23,893
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that the way, that's exactly how it's gonna stay?

900
01:18:35,695 --> 01:18:36,576
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, no.

901
01:18:37,597 --> 01:18:45,283
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, as you guys know, we, I mean, we come up to city hall and we just fill out a little form, drop it off, we're on our way.

902
01:18:45,363 --> 01:18:50,106
[SPEAKER_17]: And you guys always, have always, forever allowed us to speak.

903
01:18:50,587 --> 01:18:52,108
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to make sure it stays that way.

904
01:18:52,168 --> 01:18:52,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is.

905
01:18:53,109 --> 01:18:56,852
[SPEAKER_07]: The intention for that is keeping it germane to the powers of the city.

906
01:18:56,892 --> 01:18:58,313
[SPEAKER_17]: No, you guys have been very good.

907
01:18:59,294 --> 01:19:03,177
[SPEAKER_17]: For sure, yeah, and it's not meant to limit, it's things like personnel things we can't speak on.

908
01:19:03,257 --> 01:19:03,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

909
01:19:04,238 --> 01:19:04,518
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

910
01:19:06,102 --> 01:19:11,345
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Vice President Bears is seconded by Councilor Tseng.

911
01:19:13,226 --> 01:19:14,306
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

912
01:19:27,173 --> 01:19:27,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Bears.

913
01:19:28,153 --> 01:19:28,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

914
01:19:30,274 --> 01:19:30,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Caraviello.

915
01:19:30,935 --> 01:19:31,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

916
01:19:31,995 --> 01:19:32,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Collins.

917
01:19:32,836 --> 01:19:33,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

918
01:19:33,316 --> 01:19:34,176
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight is absent.

919
01:19:34,216 --> 01:19:34,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpelli.

920
01:19:36,081 --> 01:19:36,622
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the same.

921
01:19:36,802 --> 01:19:37,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, President.

922
01:19:38,284 --> 01:19:47,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, six in the affirmative one absolutely motion passes 22-325 offered by President Morell unless Councilors disagree I can

923
01:19:50,394 --> 01:20:01,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas personal use of drones slash unmanned aircraft is increasingly popular and whereas the use of personal drones in a densely populated city like Medford can impact quality of life and one's reasonable expectation of privacy.

924
01:20:02,299 --> 01:20:10,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it so resolved that the city council request the city solicitor provide draft language for an ordinance regulating the personal use of drones slash unmanned aircraft systems in Medford.

925
01:20:11,832 --> 01:20:17,239
[SPEAKER_09]: This came about a few residents have reached out concern they've had some experiences with covering over their property.

926
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:25,311
[SPEAKER_09]: There are some regulations at the state level but increasingly cities are taking this on just to make it clear what you know boundaries around personal property.

927
01:20:25,939 --> 01:20:28,440
[SPEAKER_09]: and using drones like that over others private property.

928
01:20:28,961 --> 01:20:40,947
[SPEAKER_09]: I do understand Councilor Caraviello's previous point about code enforcement regarding this and this, you know, this will be even trickier, but I would like to just see a draft, see what we can do so we at least have some regulations we can point to.

929
01:20:42,827 --> 01:20:48,092
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam President, I, this was something that was brought up before you were on the council.

930
01:20:49,013 --> 01:20:54,859
[SPEAKER_19]: When drones first came out because we had gotten a few complaints from people that drones were hanging on people's windows.

931
01:20:55,459 --> 01:21:03,507
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't remember, I think the council might would know but I think we had sent something to the solicitor.

932
01:21:04,303 --> 01:21:07,905
[SPEAKER_19]: to draft up some type of ordinance for this in the past.

933
01:21:07,945 --> 01:21:10,267
[SPEAKER_19]: You may want to check with the solicitor's office.

934
01:21:10,287 --> 01:21:19,792
[SPEAKER_19]: There may be something that had been there for an older paper, but I do remember this had come up before when the drones were first coming down and they were a part of it.

935
01:21:19,812 --> 01:21:25,956
[SPEAKER_19]: So I support this, but there may be something that might've been already in place that's there now.

936
01:21:26,236 --> 01:21:26,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect.

937
01:21:26,537 --> 01:21:27,437
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

938
01:21:28,378 --> 01:21:29,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion?

939
01:21:30,099 --> 01:21:30,599
[SPEAKER_19]: Motion approved.

940
01:21:31,345 --> 01:21:34,408
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

941
01:21:34,708 --> 01:21:35,448
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

942
01:21:36,229 --> 01:21:36,910
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

943
01:21:36,950 --> 01:21:37,810
[SPEAKER_09]: The motion passes.

944
01:21:38,791 --> 01:21:40,152
[SPEAKER_09]: Communications from the Mayor.

945

[SPEAKER_09]: 22-317, to President Nicole Morell and honorable members of the Medford City Council, from Mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn, regarding loan order sidewalk bonds.

946
01:21:49,980 --> 01:21:56,125
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Madam President and City Councilors, I respect the request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following loan order.

948
01:22:17,325 --> 01:22:41,728
[SPEAKER_09]: is authorized to borrow said sum under and pursuant to Massachusetts general laws chapter 44 section 7 1 as amended and supplemented or pursuant to any other enabling authority and to issue bonds or notes of the city therefore and further ordered that the city treasurer is authorized to file an application with the appropriate officials of the commonwealth of massachusetts here and after the commonwealth

949
01:22:42,288 --> 01:23:10,377
[SPEAKER_09]: to qualify under chapter 44a of the general laws any and all bonds or notes of the city authorized by the vote or pursuant to any prior vote of the city and in such connection therewith to provide such information to execute documents as such officials of the commonwealth may require very truly yours mayor brianna um and then this is the same paper number okay continuing

950
01:23:12,535 --> 01:23:19,654
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm too present a formula members of the honorable member of city council regarding paper 22-317 on order opinion sidewalk box.

951
01:23:20,569 --> 01:23:32,655
[SPEAKER_09]: Dear Madam President and members of the Medford City Council, in accordance with the provisions of the Medford City Council Rule 22, I have examined the above captioned loan order as to its legality and hereby submit my findings.

952
01:23:33,315 --> 01:23:44,220
[SPEAKER_09]: I certify that the loan order set forth in Council Paper 22-317 in which authorization is sought to borrow $1 million for the purpose of paying the cost of constructing and reconstructing

953
01:23:45,040 --> 01:24:03,426
[SPEAKER_09]: various sidewalks throughout the city, including all costs incidental and related to their to and to issue bonds or notes of the city instead aggregate principal amount under and pursuant to general laws chapter 44 section seven, one, including the payment of all costs incidental and related there to it's valid.

954
01:24:03,926 --> 01:24:11,029
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm of the opinion that there is a lawful authority for the issuance of set bonds under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts presently in force.

955
01:24:11,689 --> 01:24:31,696
[SPEAKER_09]: I further certify that the purposes for which these bonds are to be issued, i.e., to pay for the cost of constructing and reconstructing sidewalks throughout the city and to issue bonds or notes of the city in said aggregate principal amount of $1 million, under and pursuant to General Laws Chapter 44, Section 7, including the payment of all costs incidental and related thereto.

956
01:24:32,296 --> 01:24:36,000
[SPEAKER_09]: is valid under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts presently enforced.

957
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,522
[SPEAKER_09]: Respectfully, Kimberly M. Scanlon.

958
01:24:39,463 --> 01:24:41,685
[SPEAKER_09]: There are two footnotes regarding Rule 22.

959
01:24:41,745 --> 01:24:45,729
[SPEAKER_09]: The current rule ordinances and bond orders refer to the city solicitor.

960
01:24:45,909 --> 01:24:57,280
[SPEAKER_09]: Every ordinance and every order for bond issue shall, before its passage, be referred to the city solicitor, who shall forthwith examine the same as to its legality and notify the council in writing of his or her findings.

961
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:22,409
[SPEAKER_09]: And the second footnote around general laws chapter 44 section 71 authorizes cities to borrow for landscaping, alteration, remediation, rehabilitation, or improvement of public land, the construction, reconstruction, rehabilitation, improvement, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, demolition, removal or repair of public buildings, facilities, assets, works or infrastructure for a period not to exceed 30 years.

962
01:25:24,795 --> 01:25:28,079
[SPEAKER_09]: I do see the Chief of Staff with us, Vice Mayor Limberis, do you have a question?

963
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:37,168
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, just on this, do we have an estimate of how many sidewalks may be repaired or how many projects may be funded with this?

964
01:25:38,089 --> 01:25:45,097
[SPEAKER_05]: And also just what the terms of the bonds are going to be, is it going to be 30 years or something else?

965
01:25:46,985 --> 01:26:01,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, president morale through you, uh, vice president bears as far as the question pertaining to which sidewalks, how many sidewalks admittedly, I've done a lot of preparation for tonight's meeting, but I did not look at that material information.

966
01:26:01,737 --> 01:26:06,081
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, frankly, I know that there is a draft contract prepared and would be happy to

967
01:26:07,341 --> 01:26:09,502
[SPEAKER_06]: the extent of the draft contract that exists.

968
01:26:09,562 --> 01:26:14,322
[SPEAKER_06]: I know procurement has been working with the engineering department and DPW on that for quite a bit of some time.

969
01:26:15,403 --> 01:26:22,984
[SPEAKER_06]: And as far as the question pertaining to the length of the borrowing or the note, that is one that I've spent a bit of time on.

970
01:26:24,664 --> 01:26:26,865
[SPEAKER_06]: At this point in time, it's too early to answer the question.

971
01:26:26,905 --> 01:26:35,286
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason for that is because it may be advantageous to the city to go out for a note, which is a short-term borrowing, rather than going out for a long-term borrowing.

972
01:26:35,906 --> 01:26:40,530
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, of course, we're keeping a close eye on what's happening with interest rates with the Fed.

973
01:26:41,031 --> 01:26:50,358
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a number of meetings coming up, as far as projections can identify at this point in time, everything is expected to go up as I'm sure you've all heard.

974
01:26:51,079 --> 01:26:54,142
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we're mindful of those issues were mindful of.

975
01:26:55,216 --> 01:26:59,299
[SPEAKER_06]: timing in terms of the length of the bond, which was your specific question, Vice President Bears.

976
01:26:59,980 --> 01:27:04,484
[SPEAKER_06]: And that also needs to be looked at from the standpoint of practicality.

977
01:27:04,824 --> 01:27:08,968
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the maximum extent allowable by law, but the practicality of it too, right?

978
01:27:08,988 --> 01:27:12,170
[SPEAKER_06]: The life of the actual infrastructure itself.

979
01:27:12,671 --> 01:27:17,655
[SPEAKER_06]: So all of these questions are ones that would be answered once we're at the point where we're prepared to borrow.

980
01:27:18,015 --> 01:27:25,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Because if it were to be a note, then we would do it obviously for a much shorter period of time notes can be only completed for a maximum of a year.

981
01:27:25,979 --> 01:27:39,747
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, the, the best case plan, which which hopefully includes the city council's approval of the first first reading this evening would be that once the loan order is fully secured.

982
01:27:40,187 --> 01:27:56,631
[SPEAKER_06]: we're able to have those kinds of strategy conversations with the city's financial advisor, which is Hilltop Securities, and work with the city's bond council to ensure that we are using the best strategy with the information that's available to us at that very time, because it is a very fluctuating and changing market as it stands.

983
01:27:56,691 --> 01:27:58,152
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, thank you.

984
01:27:59,272 --> 01:28:03,553
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Madam President, and thank you, Nina, for being here tonight.

985
01:28:04,307 --> 01:28:09,929
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna be consistent with my vote with this process.

986
01:28:09,989 --> 01:28:30,978
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that when, uh, Madam Mayor was part of this committee, we both agreed and looked at the process of bonding every year of 250 now $1 million for something that, um, I actively at the time years ago, went out and secured a breakdown financial breakdown of, uh,

987
01:28:34,791 --> 01:28:46,698
[SPEAKER_16]: a truck, three employees, what it would cost to have three more DPW employees, as other communities have, a sidewalk and hot top crew that work for you year round.

988
01:28:47,299 --> 01:28:50,581
[SPEAKER_16]: And I believe at that time it was $250,000.

989
01:28:51,301 --> 01:28:53,202
[SPEAKER_16]: And that was a one-time cost.

990
01:28:53,262 --> 01:28:59,386
[SPEAKER_16]: Then all that was left was the payment of the three employees for the year.

991
01:29:01,428 --> 01:29:14,407
[SPEAKER_16]: I kept bringing up the same piece if we're going to figure out a way to spend $250,000 and only getting a few sidewalks done, or having no crew for doing hot, hot patch or hot top.

992
01:29:15,738 --> 01:29:20,721
[SPEAKER_16]: pothole remediation that we look into at budget season.

993
01:29:20,941 --> 01:29:28,566
[SPEAKER_16]: I put forth the recommendation every year that we input a hot top and sidewalk crew for this reason.

994
01:29:29,227 --> 01:29:31,568
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I'll reiterate this.

995
01:29:31,688 --> 01:29:32,589
[SPEAKER_16]: I know it needs to be done.

996
01:29:32,609 --> 01:29:35,171
[SPEAKER_16]: I won't support it because I have historically

997
01:29:35,871 --> 01:29:49,275
[SPEAKER_16]: said over and over again the redundancy of this this ask could be gone and we could be now looking at a crew of three extra employees in the city that could then assist other departments when needed.

998
01:29:50,635 --> 01:30:01,098
[SPEAKER_16]: There are so many benefits to adding a sidewalk hot top groove that I just think that this is fundamentally fiscally wrong

999
01:30:01,858 --> 01:30:08,204
[SPEAKER_16]: coming up and asking for bonds every year for 250, 500,000 this year is a million dollars.

1000
01:30:08,804 --> 01:30:10,266
[SPEAKER_16]: So I can't support it.

1001
01:30:10,286 --> 01:30:23,217
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's the only reason why I think that it's the studies that we brought forth, the numbers we brought forth in the past shows that this doesn't have to be a bonded item.

1002
01:30:23,277 --> 01:30:25,680
[SPEAKER_16]: It doesn't have to be a loan.

1003
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:34,762
[SPEAKER_16]: this could be a department in our city that would help us throughout the year and fulfilling the need of our community as we go.

1004
01:30:34,822 --> 01:30:39,344
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, just wanted to make sure that you knew wasn't nothing personal.

1005
01:30:39,384 --> 01:30:49,247
[SPEAKER_16]: This is something that I've been preaching for since I came on this council years ago that it's, uh, I did my due diligence.

1006
01:30:49,287 --> 01:30:50,067
[SPEAKER_16]: I did my homework.

1007
01:30:50,167 --> 01:30:53,968
[SPEAKER_16]: I put a few local DPW commissioners put

1008
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:59,382
[SPEAKER_16]: plans for it that I submitted to the, to the council at the time, the mayors at the time.

1009
01:31:00,043 --> 01:31:07,166
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just think this is, again, it's another, another year that I'll be saying this, a million dollars.

1010
01:31:07,186 --> 01:31:17,532
[SPEAKER_16]: I know it doesn't come from the same pool, but a million dollars spent, $250,000 spent one way would save us a million dollar discussion today.

1011
01:31:17,612 --> 01:31:22,694
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just think it's a redundancy that we don't need anymore in this community with this.

1012
01:31:22,734 --> 01:31:23,675
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you.

1013
01:31:24,969 --> 01:31:26,850
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1014
01:31:26,910 --> 01:31:37,416
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President didn't come Scott plays 100% right, something I supported before Council Scott probably done on the council, you know, I don't know how many times I voted for 250,000 half a million.

1015
01:31:37,977 --> 01:31:51,445
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, do we ever get our value I mean do we ever get the money enough sidewalks done out of the money that we spent is there money left in any of the council that we've appropriated in the past that has leftover money for sidewalks that didn't get done.

1016
01:31:54,161 --> 01:31:59,323
[SPEAKER_19]: And it isn't just this administration, it's been the administration before that, the administration before that.

1017
01:31:59,643 --> 01:32:07,807
[SPEAKER_19]: So this is, this isn't, this is not a knock on your door, but it's just something that just keeps rolling every year, every year we keep voting for this.

1018
01:32:07,887 --> 01:32:10,708
[SPEAKER_19]: And somewhere along the line, you have to say no.

1019
01:32:11,548 --> 01:32:12,769
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, for

1020
01:32:14,292 --> 01:32:18,333
[SPEAKER_19]: for a small capital investment, we have these people forever.

1021
01:32:19,333 --> 01:32:23,034
[SPEAKER_19]: Sidewalks are a job that is never, ever gonna stop.

1022
01:32:25,135 --> 01:32:31,077
[SPEAKER_19]: You could have a whole department of six people doing that, and they'll have enough sidewalks to keep them going all year round.

1023
01:32:31,137 --> 01:32:34,257
[SPEAKER_19]: And then when they come out of season, you have them to do other stuff.

1024
01:32:34,517 --> 01:32:36,898
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, I have a hard time supporting this again.

1025
01:32:37,278 --> 01:32:43,280
[SPEAKER_19]: I've supported it many times in the past, but somewhere along the line, we have to say, stop, and let's do it right.

1026
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:47,741
[SPEAKER_19]: always going to be doing is that we just keep piecemealing, piecemealing everything.

1027
01:32:48,481 --> 01:32:49,821
[SPEAKER_19]: Let's do it, do it and do it right.

1028
01:32:49,841 --> 01:33:02,104
[SPEAKER_06]: I find a, you know, I'm sure that there's a lot of history to this and I'm sure it would be beneficial for me to speak with you, Councilor Scarapelli and with you, Councilor Caraviello offline.

1029
01:33:03,065 --> 01:33:11,027
[SPEAKER_06]: But just to make sure that I'm not leaving anything off the discussion table to make sure that we're discussing the same thing.

1030
01:33:12,607 --> 01:33:18,169
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't think your point is lost on the Councilor scarab Kelly but without having done that analysis you mentioned myself.

1031
01:33:19,209 --> 01:33:28,352
[SPEAKER_06]: What's before the city council tonight is capital improvements capital improvements for city sidewalks as well as sidewalks to be built where sidewalks may not exist.

1032
01:33:30,132 --> 01:33:36,815
[SPEAKER_06]: what I believe Councilor Scarapelli, you're referring to is crews to maintain those items.

1033
01:33:37,835 --> 01:33:39,976
[SPEAKER_06]: But you're shaking your head now, so I'm gonna stop there.

1034
01:33:40,056 --> 01:33:46,298
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to make sure that I was presenting this in a way that was clear about what was being asked.

1035
01:33:46,799 --> 01:33:51,640
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, I think the presentation, you're right on.

1036
01:33:51,821 --> 01:33:52,761
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand that we need it.

1037
01:33:53,661 --> 01:33:55,162
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, the other reason why we're

1038
01:33:56,861 --> 01:34:00,403
[SPEAKER_16]: Historically, I've done the homework.

1039
01:34:00,463 --> 01:34:08,028
[SPEAKER_16]: We've mentioned this both as former Councilors and former, like Councilor Caraviello says, this isn't just this administration.

1040
01:34:08,248 --> 01:34:14,732
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been every administration before that, that we've sat and talked about this and we keep bonding so much money.

1041
01:34:15,192 --> 01:34:19,975
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the question comes back at the end of the year, we sit with the DPW director, we say, what do we get done?

1042
01:34:20,375 --> 01:34:23,597
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, unfortunately the contractors couldn't do this or couldn't do that.

1043
01:34:24,137 --> 01:34:28,181
[SPEAKER_16]: And then unfortunately came into the season when we couldn't pour cement anymore.

1044
01:34:28,201 --> 01:34:39,211
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we lose our window because we help hold everything out to outside agencies where if we have our own department three person department with our own equipment.

1045
01:34:39,732 --> 01:34:42,574
[SPEAKER_16]: As soon as the weather breaks and as soon as the cement can cure.

1046
01:34:43,415 --> 01:34:55,463
[SPEAKER_16]: and other communities, boom, they're out there and they're working, they're putting sidewalks in, they're replacing sidewalks and then when cement can't be cured, now it breaks right into the winter season and potholes have to be filled.

1047
01:34:55,883 --> 01:35:02,787
[SPEAKER_16]: Those crews that were doing cement sidewalks, they're now filling potholes all over their cities, making sure that that's kept up.

1048
01:35:03,267 --> 01:35:07,090
[SPEAKER_16]: So, again, it's, I understand you don't know the history of it and

1049
01:35:07,570 --> 01:35:18,042
[SPEAKER_16]: That's something maybe I should I should touch base the earlier so but I think this is something that I've said over and over again for years that this is something that we really need a dedicated crew.

1050
01:35:18,062 --> 01:35:27,333
[SPEAKER_16]: And if I supported this tonight, that would come on budget season and say, well, why would why would we need to look into into hiring our own

1051
01:35:27,820 --> 01:35:32,023
[SPEAKER_16]: cruise if we're going to accept the million dollar bonds every time it comes forth.

1052
01:35:32,063 --> 01:35:36,246
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's why I have to stay away from this and not support it.

1053
01:35:36,266 --> 01:35:37,807
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's the only reason why.

1054
01:35:38,207 --> 01:35:44,391
[SPEAKER_16]: It's because it's something that I feel strongly about for many years, not just today, but in many different administrations.

1055
01:35:44,911 --> 01:35:47,633
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it goes all the way back to the McGlynn era.

1056
01:35:47,693 --> 01:35:52,657
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's not that expensive.

1057
01:35:53,782 --> 01:35:55,423
[SPEAKER_16]: if we could do a cost analysis.

1058
01:35:55,463 --> 01:36:00,905
[SPEAKER_16]: I know it's a little bit more than it was back in the day, but it was one truck and the equipment that was needed.

1059
01:36:00,965 --> 01:36:10,130
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, the only reoccurring cost is the three staff members that could definitely be used in different sections in our DPW when needed.

1060
01:36:10,230 --> 01:36:13,811
[SPEAKER_16]: So when we weren't in season for sidewalks.

1061
01:36:13,831 --> 01:36:18,874
[SPEAKER_16]: So again, thank you for understanding.

1062
01:36:18,914 --> 01:36:19,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1063
01:36:22,307 --> 01:36:30,932
[SPEAKER_19]: You mentioned something that I'm not seeing here, maybe I didn't see it, but you talked about putting sidewalks where they're on that.

1064
01:36:31,092 --> 01:36:39,457
[SPEAKER_19]: If you think you're gonna do that with a million dollars, you're not gonna get very far at all, because when you put in a brand new sidewalk, you also have to put in sewage and curbing.

1065
01:36:39,477 --> 01:36:42,359
[SPEAKER_19]: So a million dollars is going nowhere on that front.

1066
01:36:43,119 --> 01:36:47,401
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, if that's in there, I don't know if I can support that part.

1067
01:36:47,842 --> 01:36:51,064
[SPEAKER_19]: But again, this is something that should have been brought to us

1068
01:36:51,942 --> 01:36:55,144
[SPEAKER_19]: Months ago, because now we went to the end of April.

1069
01:36:55,424 --> 01:36:56,445
[SPEAKER_19]: We haven't approved this yet.

1070
01:36:56,705 --> 01:36:57,726
[SPEAKER_19]: We haven't even got the bond.

1071
01:37:00,108 --> 01:37:02,189
[SPEAKER_19]: The concrete companies are already booked up.

1072
01:37:04,030 --> 01:37:05,071
[SPEAKER_19]: This has happened in the past.

1073
01:37:05,111 --> 01:37:06,051
[SPEAKER_19]: We waited too long.

1074
01:37:06,412 --> 01:37:09,634
[SPEAKER_19]: And now before you know it, the concrete companies are starting in September.

1075
01:37:09,894 --> 01:37:11,355
[SPEAKER_19]: So they only got two months to work.

1076
01:37:12,576 --> 01:37:13,937
[SPEAKER_19]: Concrete guys should have been out there now.

1077
01:37:14,157 --> 01:37:16,699
[SPEAKER_19]: This is something that should have been brought to us four or five months ago.

1078
01:37:17,689 --> 01:37:18,050
[SPEAKER_19]: vote on.

1079
01:37:18,070 --> 01:37:18,511
[SPEAKER_19]: Not now.

1080
01:37:18,531 --> 01:37:22,379
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, as usual, we're just late into the game with this.

1081
01:37:24,069 --> 01:37:42,425
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know but I say, but putting sidewalks where there aren't none is a million dollars isn't going to go anywhere because say, because, and again, you know, you want to do that to, so we get more chapter 90 money but that also includes putting in sewer work and sewer work costs a lot more money too.

1082
01:37:42,845 --> 01:37:45,307
[SPEAKER_19]: And I say a million dollars isn't going anywhere.

1083
01:37:45,667 --> 01:37:47,869
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, I'm with Councilor Scott Perry on this.

1084
01:37:48,230 --> 01:37:49,471
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's about time that we stop.

1085
01:37:50,978 --> 01:37:53,940
[SPEAKER_19]: do it the right way as a stop pushing this down the road.

1086
01:37:55,081 --> 01:38:04,127
[SPEAKER_19]: Every year we keep voting million and half a million half a million, and we're getting no bang for our buck anymore.

1087
01:38:04,207 --> 01:38:05,047
[SPEAKER_09]: President Bears.

1088
01:38:07,188 --> 01:38:11,751
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing I wanted to clarify is that I believe it would be fair for more.

1089
01:38:12,884 --> 01:38:18,690
[SPEAKER_06]: more appropriate for me to say that this would provide Ada accessibility where there are no ramps.

1090
01:38:19,510 --> 01:38:31,262
[SPEAKER_06]: In fairness, because I think your point is valid but I was trying to pull up the contract and also listen to the comments of the Councilors so I can try to potentially answer the original question that Councilors carefully had with regard to

1091
01:38:32,476 --> 01:38:35,258
[SPEAKER_06]: and I'll try to do that right now as I continue to listen.

1092
01:38:35,538 --> 01:38:37,439
[SPEAKER_19]: But again, this doesn't go back to you.

1093
01:38:37,479 --> 01:38:42,482
[SPEAKER_19]: This has been an ongoing program for the past administrations in the past.

1094
01:38:43,002 --> 01:38:49,626
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not saying that this is germane, but all we keep doing is just throwing, every year it's more money, more money, more money.

1095
01:38:50,146 --> 01:38:53,448
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't see any, I don't see enough sidewalks getting done.

1096
01:38:53,468 --> 01:38:56,589
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Vice President Paris.

1097
01:38:57,150 --> 01:38:58,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

1098
01:39:00,011 --> 01:39:01,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wondering if,

1099
01:39:02,260 --> 01:39:10,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Any of these funds are going to be used in concert with other funding, or is it so you put this is basically we're taking out this loan order for the sidewalks.

1100
01:39:12,148 --> 01:39:19,474
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, may that occur concurrently with the street repair fund of the chapter 90 funds or is it all just kind of separated out.

1101
01:39:22,420 --> 01:39:31,668
[SPEAKER_06]: My guess, and it would purely be a guess without having spoken with the DPW commissioner, would be that it would be maximized with all funding available sources.

1102
01:39:32,068 --> 01:39:39,795
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's because I know the way that they work and I know that their strategy is focused on always maximizing.

1103
01:39:40,175 --> 01:39:40,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

1104
01:39:42,317 --> 01:39:43,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Vice President Bears.

1105
01:39:44,499 --> 01:39:49,584
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion from the council as we wait for answers from Chief of Staff?

1106
01:39:53,181 --> 01:39:55,283
[SPEAKER_09]: Members of the public would like to answer comments.

1107
01:39:56,344 --> 01:40:02,550
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, President real, and to the center and thank you for being here and thank you for discussing this with us.

1108
01:40:03,031 --> 01:40:16,804
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm wondering to Councilor to Vice President beers first questions question I also had sort of the the estimate of how big of an impact this loan could make in terms of number of streets number of sidewalks number of

1109
01:40:17,460 --> 01:40:20,502
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, areas of ADA compliance where there previously wasn't compliance.

1110
01:40:20,902 --> 01:40:25,664
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm curious if you think that's the type of thing that we could find an answer to in the next couple of weeks.

1111
01:40:25,704 --> 01:40:29,146
[SPEAKER_11]: I know for myself, that's something that it feels like an important detail.

1112
01:40:29,206 --> 01:40:31,747
[SPEAKER_11]: And I understand there's a lot of details to parse through.

1113
01:40:31,867 --> 01:40:35,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Collins, if you could just lean in, the HVAC has kicked on.

1114
01:40:35,249 --> 01:40:36,750
[SPEAKER_11]: If you could just lean in a little bit more.

1115
01:40:36,910 --> 01:40:37,270
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly.

1116
01:40:37,510 --> 01:40:38,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, sorry about that.

1117
01:40:39,130 --> 01:40:40,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, now I hear myself echoing.

1118
01:40:40,591 --> 01:41:01,276
[SPEAKER_11]: I was wondering to the question of, you know, what the impact of a load of the size would have in terms of sidewalks repaired, new areas of ADA compliance where there previously wasn't, if you thought that was the type of detail that we could have an answer to within a week or two, or if you think that's part of the further down the line type of answer.

1119
01:41:02,517 --> 01:41:03,017
[SPEAKER_06]: President Morell.

1120
01:41:03,667 --> 01:41:17,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Through you, yes I do believe that that information should be available at this point there should be already a plan that exists within the engineering division or within the DPW or both, where that information would be able to be secured and provided to the city council.

1121
01:41:21,177 --> 01:41:27,818
[SPEAKER_06]: potentially hold this, the table, this item and bring it up at the next city council meeting and further discuss it.

1122
01:41:28,198 --> 01:41:36,780
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason I would propose that considering the comments and questions that remain open is because of the timing, the very timing that's been discussed tonight.

1123
01:41:36,960 --> 01:41:43,502
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is to ensure that we could probably, my understanding and reviewing the process by the city council,

1124
01:41:45,242 --> 01:41:53,189
[SPEAKER_06]: That relates to, you know, the City Council rules that relates to obviously the statute relates to required advertisement periods.

1125
01:41:53,609 --> 01:42:08,442
[SPEAKER_06]: This process will take roughly six to eight weeks to complete to get the loan order fully approved, which puts us into early June at this point, and the goal was to have concurrent sidewalk contract being bid at the same time as we were working on

1126
01:42:09,311 --> 01:42:16,387
[SPEAKER_06]: securing the loan order so that we would have something ready and good to go for June, so that work could begin.

1127
01:42:18,291 --> 01:42:40,116
[SPEAKER_06]: So my proposal would be in fact, if it doesn't appear and it certainly doesn't appear to me at this point in time, but I defer to the council that this has any legs, so to speak at this point in time, then perhaps the next best appropriate action would be for me to collect some further information and come back to the city council at your next meeting.

1128
01:42:41,997 --> 01:42:42,457
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1129
01:42:43,223 --> 01:42:44,244
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam President.

1130
01:42:45,284 --> 01:42:49,608
[SPEAKER_19]: On top of doing this, we're also subject to the shoddy work of these subcontractors.

1131
01:42:49,628 --> 01:42:52,389
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, we don't have a clerk of the works to stay on top of them.

1132
01:42:55,011 --> 01:42:57,133
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, we're short-staffed in the DBO, so they came on top.

1133
01:42:57,473 --> 01:43:04,738
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm gonna give you a perfect example of shoddy work on the sidewalk is go out right in front of this building and go down the end of the ramp.

1134
01:43:05,058 --> 01:43:08,241
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think that sidewalk is three years old, four years old.

1135
01:43:08,801 --> 01:43:09,762
[SPEAKER_19]: It's all crumbled up.

1136
01:43:10,915 --> 01:43:15,238
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's right in front of City Hall, nevermind in front of somebody's house.

1137
01:43:15,818 --> 01:43:20,121
[SPEAKER_19]: When you leave the building today, just walk down to that ramp and look at the sidewalk in front of the building.

1138
01:43:21,402 --> 01:43:24,805
[SPEAKER_19]: Less than four years, it's all crumbled up, brand new sidewalk.

1139
01:43:26,109 --> 01:43:34,611
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's what, you know, when you hire contractors late into the season, you're going to get third rate contractors.

1140
01:43:35,031 --> 01:43:39,012
[SPEAKER_19]: Because like I say, this is something that should have been brought to us months ago.

1141
01:43:39,372 --> 01:43:41,793
[SPEAKER_19]: So like you said, it takes eight weeks.

1142
01:43:42,693 --> 01:43:44,154
[SPEAKER_19]: Could have hired these people in February.

1143
01:43:44,854 --> 01:43:45,634
[SPEAKER_19]: Can't hire them now.

1144
01:43:46,414 --> 01:43:49,675
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll say all the good contractors are going to be gone.

1145
01:43:50,270 --> 01:43:56,873
[SPEAKER_19]: And as we always do, we always get the second and third rate people to do the work and they do shoddy work.

1146
01:43:59,694 --> 01:44:01,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1147
01:44:01,055 --> 01:44:01,575
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Beres.

1148
01:44:02,075 --> 01:44:02,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

1149
01:44:05,508 --> 01:44:13,074
[SPEAKER_05]: Given the way the process works, I personally would not be opposed to approving this for a first reading tonight.

1150
01:44:13,174 --> 01:44:17,738
[SPEAKER_05]: We would not end up in final approval as noted for several weeks.

1151
01:44:18,358 --> 01:44:27,645
[SPEAKER_05]: That would allow us to get the shot clock moving on the process while still being able to discuss the further questions and concerns of the council.

1152
01:44:28,266 --> 01:44:34,671
[SPEAKER_05]: That would just be my suggestion here, but certainly willing to hear what other councilors think.

1153
01:44:35,962 --> 01:44:42,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Would you like that in the form of motion or it's a suggestion at this point.

1154
01:44:42,594 --> 01:44:43,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Collins and Councilor Caraviello.

1155
01:44:45,038 --> 01:44:45,800
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you President Rowe.

1156
01:44:47,638 --> 01:44:56,923
[SPEAKER_11]: I think where I'm landing on this issue personally, you know, I think my fellow councilors, councilor Caraviello and councilor Scarpelli make many points that I actually really agree with.

1157
01:44:56,983 --> 01:45:05,948
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, in general, across many, many city departments, I'm, you know, passionately believe in bringing more things in house to, you know, to the greatest extent.

1158
01:45:06,068 --> 01:45:07,388
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it makes sense fiscally.

1159
01:45:07,408 --> 01:45:08,349
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's the right thing to do.

1160
01:45:08,889 --> 01:45:15,312
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, whether that's DPW or even our housing resources, I think that these are goals that we need to be holding the administration to.

1161
01:45:16,473 --> 01:45:22,516
[SPEAKER_11]: At the same time, we've already talked about navigability, sidewalk accessibility earlier this meeting in the context of the snow removal ordinance.

1162
01:45:23,276 --> 01:45:30,979
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that that is a really pressing issue that affects many residents of the city.

1163
01:45:31,019 --> 01:45:37,822
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think when we think about accessibility, when we think about equity, navigation accessibility has to be a big part of that.

1164
01:45:37,882 --> 01:45:41,224
[SPEAKER_11]: So while I think that there's a lot of

1165
01:45:42,364 --> 01:45:45,667
[SPEAKER_11]: very important consideration to be had over the topic that this brings up.

1166
01:45:46,908 --> 01:46:07,086
[SPEAKER_11]: I would support a motion to approve for first reading tonight because, you know, while there may be a hypothetical better scenario for addressing the issue of our dilapidated sidewalks across the city, I think that, you know, we do have crumbling sidewalks right now that do need to be addressed this year.

1167
01:46:08,267 --> 01:46:08,887
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know,

1168
01:46:09,888 --> 01:46:21,312
[SPEAKER_11]: I would support a motion to approve, but I would also say, you know, for going forward, I think that a better approach is something that we need to continue to prioritize and develop a strategy around.

1169
01:46:21,332 --> 01:46:21,732
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1170
01:46:22,393 --> 01:46:23,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1171
01:46:23,253 --> 01:46:24,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

1172
01:46:24,033 --> 01:46:24,994
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1173
01:46:26,034 --> 01:46:28,995
[SPEAKER_19]: Do we have money in free cash?

1174
01:46:29,055 --> 01:46:33,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Free cash is in the certification process, but yes, the answer is absolutely, we do our estimating.

1175
01:46:33,276 --> 01:46:34,417
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you have a guesstimate number?

1176
01:46:35,591 --> 01:46:38,152
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm hesitant to make a statement.

1177
01:46:38,252 --> 01:46:47,597
[SPEAKER_06]: So in, in this in this profession, it is always recommended that a guesstimate not be presented because it goes through a certification process.

1178
01:46:47,897 --> 01:46:50,959
[SPEAKER_06]: That being said, what I can guesstimate is.

1179
01:46:50,979 --> 01:46:57,262
[SPEAKER_06]: And by guesstimate I mean I've spoken with the interim finance director on the subject is that we are in within

1180
01:46:58,447 --> 01:47:04,151
[SPEAKER_06]: a reasonable, we're close to prior year, the last prior year's fiscal cash number.

1181
01:47:05,853 --> 01:47:06,593
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, sir.

1182
01:47:07,294 --> 01:47:08,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, please don't hold me to that.

1183
01:47:08,815 --> 01:47:11,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not final until it's final.

1184
01:47:11,677 --> 01:47:11,937
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.

1185
01:47:12,117 --> 01:47:13,939
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, no, no.

1186
01:47:13,999 --> 01:47:15,380
[SPEAKER_19]: No, that just scares me what we were in that.

1187
01:47:16,380 --> 01:47:19,143
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe that's something you want to take the money out of there and spend it out of there.

1188
01:47:19,643 --> 01:47:26,888
[SPEAKER_19]: So we don't have to take a loan because we say this somewhere along the line, you're going to be coming up here for a lot, a lot of loans.

1189
01:47:27,829 --> 01:47:30,271
[SPEAKER_19]: You're gonna have to figure out where our priorities are.

1190
01:47:32,172 --> 01:47:39,098
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, you see, we had a school department here a couple of hours ago, that's gonna be looking for some serious money.

1191
01:47:40,619 --> 01:47:45,883
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, how much can we afford to want?

1192
01:47:47,504 --> 01:47:49,306
[SPEAKER_19]: And that gets to be a question too.

1193
01:47:50,246 --> 01:47:57,352
[SPEAKER_06]: And President Morell, if I may, without necessarily touching on every point you made,

1194
01:47:58,254 --> 01:48:03,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caraviello, I would say that the work of the school department is further down the road.

1195
01:48:03,816 --> 01:48:22,283
[SPEAKER_06]: And while I was not specific to Vice President Bears' question, it's hard for me to imagine that there's gonna be a lot of overlap between these sidewalk bonds that are being presented tonight and the high school itself.

1196
01:48:22,643 --> 01:48:25,524
[SPEAKER_06]: That being said, again, it's all based on

1197
01:48:26,565 --> 01:48:32,791
[SPEAKER_06]: What makes sense with the city's debt schedule what makes sense in terms of the outlook of future debt.

1198
01:48:33,251 --> 01:48:39,416
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are discussions that are ongoing on a regular basis annually, probably quarterly at a minimum that occur.

1199
01:48:40,780 --> 01:48:44,603
[SPEAKER_06]: in the development of the overall long-term strategic financial plan.

1200
01:48:44,623 --> 01:48:56,852
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll also state, if I may, that I would not recommend using free cash for sidewalk capital infrastructure, strictly because the city's essentially rainy day fund is its free cash.

1201
01:48:57,032 --> 01:48:59,094
[SPEAKER_06]: And so for that reason, I wouldn't recommend that.

1202
01:49:00,635 --> 01:49:01,556
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Chief Staff.

1203
01:49:01,896 --> 01:49:03,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you have something to describe earlier?

1204
01:49:03,477 --> 01:49:04,938
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1205
01:49:05,118 --> 01:49:05,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1206
01:49:06,259 --> 01:49:07,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

1207
01:49:07,700 --> 01:49:08,681
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think, you know,

1208
01:49:10,308 --> 01:49:18,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I've said it before and I'll say it again, but we do have this multi hundred, you know, a hundred million dollar plus backlog on roads and sidewalk repair.

1209
01:49:18,813 --> 01:49:30,061
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not trying to tie this specific request to that necessarily, but you know, this is 1 million versus a hundred million in total need to a hundred million or more now probably.

1210
01:49:30,081 --> 01:49:37,926
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it speaks to what Councilor Scarpelli was speaking about earlier when the schools came up is, you know, we have,

1211
01:49:39,133 --> 01:49:49,601
[SPEAKER_05]: hundreds of millions of dollars of capital need in this city across things that affect every single person in the city, schools, fire, roads, IT,

1212
01:49:51,125 --> 01:49:55,227
[SPEAKER_05]: To be honest, I think we could throw in the bathrooms at City Hall if anyone's come down here lately.

1213
01:49:56,667 --> 01:50:08,813
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's just a ton of capital need and and Councilors saying made a good point to, you know, when we do the small stuff, but we don't address the substantive foundational issue.

1214
01:50:09,735 --> 01:50:11,856
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, is that a good long-term strategy?

1215
01:50:11,876 --> 01:50:12,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think so.

1216
01:50:12,676 --> 01:50:28,420
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't, I don't think that's the long, you know, I hear when you're talking about the long-term strategy, Madam Chief of Staff of this administration, I think it sounds like we're moving in a different direction from where we've been in the past, you know, several decades of kind of taking it off a small piece at a time.

1217
01:50:28,520 --> 01:50:33,961
[SPEAKER_05]: So while I'm encouraged by some of the rhetoric, I think, you know,

1218
01:50:35,324 --> 01:50:48,409
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this whole city could really get behind a comprehensive plan to address our capital needs in the numbers that we're really talking about in the numbers of, of those large, you know, hundred million plus

1219
01:50:50,435 --> 01:50:56,479
[SPEAKER_05]: for roads, a hundred million plus for schools, probably more than that, you know, tens of millions for the fire stations at least.

1220
01:50:57,260 --> 01:51:16,753
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think if we could bring everyone together around a comprehensive way to fund that, that would move us in a great direction to solving problems that we hear about from everybody who lives in the city that we heard about tonight when we're talking about snow shoveling, when you can't get down the sidewalk because it's cracked and broken, you know,

1221
01:51:17,713 --> 01:51:22,738
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just think that's the direction we should be moving in sooner rather than later.

1222
01:51:22,758 --> 01:51:32,887
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope that all of the bodies of city government, ourselves, the school committee, and the mayor can be on the same page as we move forward.

1223
01:51:33,227 --> 01:51:33,528
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1224
01:51:33,708 --> 01:51:40,314
[SPEAKER_06]: President Morell, just on the suggestion that Vice President Bears made, if I could just appeal to the city council for one moment.

1225
01:51:40,774 --> 01:51:43,496
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the suggestion by Vice President Bears makes

1226
01:51:44,217 --> 01:51:53,701
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of sense for both the process to consider moving forward these items as well as for the City Council, because you do get another so-called bite at the apple.

1227
01:51:54,141 --> 01:51:59,923
[SPEAKER_06]: In the third reading, you could vote this item down if you did not feel sufficient information was presented to you all.

1228
01:52:00,604 --> 01:52:07,366
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would please ask that we try to, just in a collaborative effort and a request of

1229
01:52:09,567 --> 01:52:14,291
[SPEAKER_06]: indulgence and your willingness to just hear additional information.

1230
01:52:14,771 --> 01:52:22,136
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd be happy to make sure that all of your questions are answered before your meeting of the third reading if the city council members would be so inclined.

1231
01:52:22,937 --> 01:52:23,217
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1232
01:52:23,738 --> 01:52:24,678
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Madam Chief of Staff.

1233
01:52:25,299 --> 01:52:32,384
[SPEAKER_09]: I would move to approve for first reading on the motion of vices and affairs to approve for first reading, seconded by Councilor Collins.

1234
01:52:33,325 --> 01:52:35,907
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Clerk, is there any discussion for members of the public?

1235
01:52:38,129 --> 01:52:40,031
[SPEAKER_09]: on the council, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1236

[SPEAKER_09]: There is two footnotes as in the previous paper, explaining Council Rule 22, as well as General Laws, Chapter 44, Section 7, which I read on the previous paper.

1263
01:55:55,898 --> 01:55:56,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions?

1264
01:55:57,059 --> 01:55:58,099
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Harris?

1265
01:55:58,500 --> 01:55:59,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Madam President.

1266
01:56:01,482 --> 01:56:02,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess two questions.

1267
01:56:02,542 --> 01:56:04,023
[SPEAKER_05]: One is going to be the same question as before.

1268
01:56:04,103 --> 01:56:11,668
[SPEAKER_05]: And I understand if you don't have the answer right in front of you, but do you have an estimate on how many stumps this loan order may be able to remove across the city?

1269
01:56:11,688 --> 01:56:17,892
[SPEAKER_05]: And then secondly, I know I was able to work with Senator Jalen and Representative Barbara Donato-Angarpoli

1270
01:56:18,609 --> 01:56:23,512
[SPEAKER_05]: to get an earmark for the city for ARPA money for $100,000 for tree planting and stump removal?

1271
01:56:24,433 --> 01:56:26,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this going to be used in concert with those funds?

1272
01:56:27,695 --> 01:56:40,163
[SPEAKER_06]: President Morell, through you to Vice President Bears, thank you for bringing up the work that was completed and thank you for that work to secure $100,000 through the state delegation.

1273
01:56:43,067 --> 01:56:47,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it would be worked in concert as well as funding that's available through CDBG.

1274
01:56:48,192 --> 01:56:54,138
[SPEAKER_06]: So for a total of $500,000 with the objective to remove the vast majority of stumps across the city.

1275
01:56:56,421 --> 01:56:56,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1276
01:56:57,102 --> 01:56:57,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.

1277
01:56:57,782 --> 01:56:59,384
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exciting and I hope we can get it done.

1278
01:57:04,361 --> 01:57:11,466
[SPEAKER_05]: We, this is from the state, the state's first ARPA bill so it's not the federal allocates separate from the 50 million that we're getting as a city.

1279
01:57:12,247 --> 01:57:16,850
[SPEAKER_05]: The ARPA bill from last last year that the state house passed 100.

1280
01:57:17,290 --> 01:57:22,494
[SPEAKER_05]: It was $100,000 for tree planting and stump removal was was one of the earmarks we were able to, to achieve.

1281
01:57:23,515 --> 01:57:24,835
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for planting and removal.

1282
01:57:24,856 --> 01:57:25,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1283
01:57:25,596 --> 01:57:26,096
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1284
01:57:31,843 --> 01:57:32,503
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you too, then.

1285
01:57:33,224 --> 01:57:34,785
[SPEAKER_06]: And I stand corrected, 600,000.

1286
01:57:34,845 --> 01:57:39,108
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got 100,000 plus 250 as presented here and 250 CDBG.

1287
01:57:39,188 --> 01:57:41,209
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think I stated 500,000 a moment ago.

1288
01:57:44,031 --> 01:57:45,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion on the council?

1289
01:57:50,295 --> 01:57:51,796
[SPEAKER_05]: One more, if you don't mind, Madam President.

1290
01:57:52,196 --> 01:57:53,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Just what's the expected timeline?

1291
01:57:54,158 --> 01:57:56,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this like this year and next year or?

1292
01:57:57,200 --> 01:58:00,002
[SPEAKER_06]: Based on discussions with the engineering division,

1293
01:58:00,961 --> 01:58:15,333
[SPEAKER_06]: the planned approach is to conduct the work over the course of this current calendar year, but I honestly suspect that this work based on the impact and based on the span of area will likely go over the course of

1294
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:18,982
[SPEAKER_06]: a year and a half or so, or two construction seasons.

1295
01:58:20,262 --> 01:58:21,143
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a big undertaking.

1296
01:58:21,203 --> 01:58:29,627
[SPEAKER_06]: That's obviously something that's known to you all more than it is to me, I'm sure, but stumps have been an issue within the city for quite some time.

1297
01:58:29,907 --> 01:58:42,834
[SPEAKER_06]: And so taking this major, it's a major undertaking, and I'm sure there are gonna be unexpected issues that come up along the way, frankly.

1298
01:58:43,634 --> 01:58:44,415
[SPEAKER_05]: One final question.

1299
01:58:47,325 --> 01:58:50,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Will the stumps be, after removed, will they be removed from the city?

1300
01:58:51,568 --> 01:58:52,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, will they be chipped up and ground?

1301
01:58:53,549 --> 01:58:59,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that we've had some ongoing issues at the Brooks Estate and the Oak Grove Cemetery with the stump dump.

1302
01:58:59,053 --> 01:59:03,076
[SPEAKER_05]: The stump dump is full as far as I'm aware.

1303
01:59:03,396 --> 01:59:09,660
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you know if they're gonna be, basically, are we gonna, are these going to the stump dump or are they leaving the city?

1304
01:59:10,507 --> 01:59:19,093
[SPEAKER_06]: If it hasn't already been written into the contract, before the contract goes out, we will certainly ensure that stumps are not dumped in the city of Medford.

1305
01:59:19,233 --> 01:59:20,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, that's fantastic, thank you.

1306
01:59:21,735 --> 01:59:23,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion from the council?

1307
01:59:24,737 --> 01:59:25,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Collins.

1308
01:59:25,618 --> 01:59:26,619
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a motion for approval.

1309
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:31,022
[SPEAKER_09]: And a motion of Councilor Collins, Councilor Caraviello.

1310
01:59:31,042 --> 01:59:36,646
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, Madam Chief, can I have the final number?

1311
01:59:37,474 --> 01:59:40,956
[SPEAKER_19]: with the loan that we're looking for and the grant, what was it?

1312
01:59:40,976 --> 01:59:40,956
600?

1313
01:59:40,996 --> 01:59:41,097
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, $600,000.

1314
01:59:41,477 --> 01:59:43,698
[SPEAKER_06]: So 600, that's with the grants that we already have, correct?

1315
01:59:43,718 --> 01:59:43,898
[SPEAKER_06]: In total.

1316
01:59:43,918 --> 01:59:51,223
[SPEAKER_19]: President Morell, through you, $250,000 proposed for this loan order, $250,000 through CDBG funds, and $100,000 through work between yourself and Vice President Harris.

1317
02:00:05,561 --> 02:00:07,202
[SPEAKER_09]: And Madam Chief of staff, if I could through the chair.

1318
02:00:07,262 --> 02:00:12,206
[SPEAKER_09]: So outside of the $100,000, this is explicitly just stumps.

1319
02:00:12,246 --> 02:00:15,588
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no tree planting for those.

1320
02:00:15,648 --> 02:00:20,531
[SPEAKER_09]: I know not everyone who has a stump wants a tree to be replaced, but this is literally just removal.

1321
02:00:22,252 --> 02:00:33,700
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that there's presently, the work that the city does with stump removal presently includes replacement with trees, but I would need to look into that further.

1322
02:00:33,720 --> 02:00:34,541
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't wanna,

1323
02:00:35,622 --> 02:00:39,485
[SPEAKER_06]: at this point in time guarantee without diving a little bit deeply into that.

1324
02:00:40,346 --> 02:00:49,374
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do know that that's been the historical approach to stump removal and hope when I look into it, that's the way that the estimate's been prepared.

1325
02:00:51,016 --> 02:00:59,103
[SPEAKER_06]: I will also say that on the last comment, one thing I would like to also note is that

1326
02:01:00,880 --> 02:01:12,207
[SPEAKER_06]: The costs associated with this work may also include costs associated with support for the administration of the work.

1327
02:01:12,647 --> 02:01:23,974
[SPEAKER_06]: So a small portion of those costs would probably be used for administration to make sure that the work gets done, the stumps are removed where they're contracted to be removed and so on and so forth.

1328
02:01:24,034 --> 02:01:27,356
[SPEAKER_06]: So just wanted to also make sure that the city council knew that based on your questions.

1329
02:01:27,656 --> 02:01:29,177
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, and I would hope that, you know,

1330
02:01:29,959 --> 02:01:43,931
[SPEAKER_09]: if it's not in process that they're automatically being replaced with trees, or that's not in process that people can be let known the process to get a tree, you know, cause folks may have had stumps in front of their house for 10 years at this point, and they don't know the process to at least get on a list to get a tree.

1331
02:01:43,971 --> 02:01:46,013
[SPEAKER_09]: So just making sure that information gets communicated.

1332
02:01:47,174 --> 02:01:47,835
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

1333
02:01:47,935 --> 02:01:48,615
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1334
02:01:50,197 --> 02:01:56,282
[SPEAKER_19]: When they do the stumps, and I know that, I know we have many stumps out there and usually the stump involved ripping the sidewalk along with it.

1335
02:01:58,607 --> 02:02:09,433
[SPEAKER_19]: What the common complaint is, is these stumps have caused pipes, people's pipes in the houses and walls, retaining walls to break.

1336
02:02:09,453 --> 02:02:21,180
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would hope that whatever contract that we hire is gonna have sufficient insurance coverage to cover the damage that goes along with taking on a stump.

1337
02:02:21,220 --> 02:02:22,680
[SPEAKER_19]: Stump is not like taking on a sidewalk.

1338
02:02:23,281 --> 02:02:25,542
[SPEAKER_19]: Those roots go, these are a hundred year old trees,

1339
02:02:25,924 --> 02:02:27,525
[SPEAKER_19]: They run deep and they run into people's yards.

1340
02:02:27,605 --> 02:02:29,346
[SPEAKER_19]: And I can hear it now.

1341
02:02:31,127 --> 02:02:32,288
[SPEAKER_19]: We can't go into people's yards.

1342
02:02:33,868 --> 02:02:45,055
[SPEAKER_19]: So again, that's, the engineering department should get their list and make sure that the places they're gonna do it don't involve going on private property.

1343
02:02:45,895 --> 02:02:51,798
[SPEAKER_19]: Because again, I think the one Mr. D'Antonio mentioned, the guy in Yale Street, stump is this high.

1344
02:02:52,719 --> 02:02:54,700
[SPEAKER_19]: And the sidewalk is just about as high as the stump.

1345
02:02:56,337 --> 02:03:12,842
[SPEAKER_19]: So, I would hope that there's a there's a list and the people be notified that the stumps going to be taken out, so they can watch what's it because you could be causing damage to these people's lands and pipes that these these things that these, these stumps have wrapped around over the last hundred years.

1346
02:03:15,262 --> 02:03:17,143
[SPEAKER_06]: And the only comment I'll add there.

1347
02:03:18,000 --> 02:03:28,302
[SPEAKER_06]: through you, President Morell, is that we are obligated in accordance with the statutes pertaining to borrowing to only conduct stump removal on public property.

1348
02:03:30,663 --> 02:03:32,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Any further discussion from the council?

1349
02:03:33,384 --> 02:03:34,804
[SPEAKER_09]: Members of the public wishing to speak?

1350

[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Collins to approve for first reading, seconded by?

[SPEAKER_09]: 22-012, April 12th, Committee of the Whole, meeting report to follow.

1363
02:04:20,689 --> 02:04:26,171

1364
02:04:27,251 --> 02:04:30,152
[SPEAKER_09]: And we just went through all of those, so do I have a motion on four?

1365
02:04:30,172 --> 02:04:32,192

1373
02:04:46,261 --> 02:04:54,246
[SPEAKER_09]: This was CDBG, where we had presentations from the public service agencies seeking funding from our CDBG federal funding.

1374
02:04:55,767 --> 02:05:07,393
[SPEAKER_09]: And that paper will go for public, it'll be a public hearing, I'll be posting it in the transcript, and that'll come before the council, I think in the first week of May, if not around that time frame.

1375

1391
02:05:41,251 --> 02:05:41,692
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1392
02:05:42,012 --> 02:05:42,313
[SPEAKER_02]: It's from you.

1393
02:05:56,116 --> 02:06:06,368
[SPEAKER_09]: 22-329 offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council send its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of John Stirella and his recent passing.

1394
02:06:07,028 --> 02:06:11,894
[SPEAKER_09]: John served his country as a World War II Navy veteran and was a dentist for 43 years.

1395
02:06:12,054 --> 02:06:15,157
[SPEAKER_09]: His presence in the City Council Chambers will be missed.

1396
02:06:15,318 --> 02:06:16,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caraviello.

1397
02:06:16,239 --> 02:06:17,260
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam President.

1398
02:06:18,563 --> 02:06:21,144
[SPEAKER_19]: Council Scott pay for the, for the members who want here.

1399
02:06:21,824 --> 02:06:29,446
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, Dr. Strella was at budget time was your worst nemesis.

1400
02:06:29,986 --> 02:06:34,567
[SPEAKER_19]: He'd be down here and he'd be pounding, pounding the crap out us, uh, all budget season.

1401
02:06:35,227 --> 02:06:39,308
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, but again, he, you know, he, you know, he had his beliefs and, uh, he had, you know, he had, uh,

1402
02:06:40,032 --> 02:06:46,496
[SPEAKER_19]: He was a good financial man, but he just never believed in the budget system that we use.

1403
02:06:46,556 --> 02:06:53,201
[SPEAKER_19]: And say, if you saw meetings in the past, he'd be here for the budget season, he'd be here forever.

1404
02:06:53,461 --> 02:06:54,782
[SPEAKER_19]: But he was a good community man.

1405
02:06:54,842 --> 02:07:00,065
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, he's got some good sons who are always volunteering in the community.

1406
02:07:00,545 --> 02:07:01,886
[SPEAKER_19]: He was a good man, good heart.

1407
02:07:02,446 --> 02:07:04,468
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, one of those iconic characters.

1408
02:07:05,303 --> 02:07:06,004
[SPEAKER_19]: they're going to be missed.

1409
02:07:06,164 --> 02:07:07,345
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll miss him in a budget time.

1410
02:07:07,845 --> 02:07:14,630
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, even though he used to kill me in budgets, but he had his beliefs and he stuck to them and I respected him for that.

1411
02:07:15,311 --> 02:07:16,432
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

1412
02:07:16,512 --> 02:07:17,673
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1413
02:07:17,713 --> 02:07:18,453
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Madam President.

1414
02:07:18,473 --> 02:07:21,816
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward.

1415
02:07:22,076 --> 02:07:29,922
[SPEAKER_16]: One thing you haven't seen here in a while is Mr. Eller, and unfortunately, you know why now, and I know he

1416
02:07:31,567 --> 02:07:36,211
[SPEAKER_16]: He was a strong man and felt very, very confident in his convictions.

1417
02:07:36,991 --> 02:07:38,733
[SPEAKER_16]: And he wasn't afraid to tell you either.

1418
02:07:39,273 --> 02:07:42,016
[SPEAKER_16]: He'd look you right in the eye and tell you, you don't know what you're talking about.

1419
02:07:44,037 --> 02:07:54,125
[SPEAKER_16]: And you can't begrudge a person that loves Medford that much in its budget system and the way he wanted to see it run.

1420
02:07:56,731 --> 02:08:00,874
[SPEAKER_16]: And he made you what I liked about Mr. He told you right to your face.

1421
02:08:00,914 --> 02:08:03,015
[SPEAKER_16]: He didn't, he didn't hide behind anybody.

1422
02:08:03,075 --> 02:08:03,996
[SPEAKER_16]: He challenged you.

1423
02:08:04,736 --> 02:08:17,464
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um, you know, he made my knees quiver a few times and some of the questions he's asked me because he was a very intelligent person and, uh, something that, um, one thing you, you can't deny is that he loved metric.

1424
02:08:18,345 --> 02:08:19,666
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and you could tell.

1425
02:08:20,505 --> 02:08:28,309
[SPEAKER_16]: by how many meetings he came and expressed his concerns about this city's fiscal responsibilities and where they were going.

1426
02:08:28,409 --> 02:08:30,771
[SPEAKER_16]: So he will be missed.

1427
02:08:31,091 --> 02:08:34,793
[SPEAKER_16]: So he is right.

1428
02:08:34,873 --> 02:08:39,656
[SPEAKER_16]: He's did say a lot of it's like Nostradamus of the financial world here in Medford.

1429
02:08:39,676 --> 02:08:41,297
[SPEAKER_16]: So, but he will be missed.

1430
02:08:41,357 --> 02:08:42,837
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's condolences to his family.

1431
02:08:42,857 --> 02:08:44,598
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, captain Scarpelli.

1432
02:08:46,179 --> 02:08:47,320
[SPEAKER_08]: Give an address for the record, please.

1433
02:08:53,765 --> 02:08:54,265
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll come on.

1434
02:08:54,726 --> 02:08:55,406
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes a minute.

1435
02:08:56,747 --> 02:08:57,708
[SPEAKER_09]: It'll come out on its own.

1436
02:08:57,748 --> 02:09:00,210
[SPEAKER_18]: There you go.

1437
02:09:00,630 --> 02:09:00,730
[SPEAKER_18]: OK.

1438
02:09:00,790 --> 02:09:02,411
[SPEAKER_18]: Dr. Starella, he was a character.

1439
02:09:04,172 --> 02:09:05,814
[SPEAKER_18]: He had quite a career in the Navy.

1440
02:09:06,894 --> 02:09:16,541
[SPEAKER_18]: And he came to become second in command to LSM 548, which is a landing ship for personnel on the beaches.

1441
02:09:17,792 --> 02:09:21,274
[SPEAKER_18]: The amazing thing with Dr. Storaro is he had chronic seasickness.

1442
02:09:21,535 --> 02:09:22,415
[SPEAKER_18]: He was in the Navy.

1443
02:09:23,116 --> 02:09:24,217
[SPEAKER_18]: It was unbelievable.

1444
02:09:25,317 --> 02:09:27,059
[SPEAKER_18]: But he was smart.

1445
02:09:27,439 --> 02:09:28,199
[SPEAKER_18]: He was a creator.

1446
02:09:28,239 --> 02:09:29,060
[SPEAKER_18]: He was an inventor.

1447
02:09:29,220 --> 02:09:30,081
[SPEAKER_18]: He was well read.

1448
02:09:30,681 --> 02:09:31,822
[SPEAKER_18]: He was honest.

1449
02:09:32,502 --> 02:09:37,526
[SPEAKER_18]: And he never turned away anybody that came to his dental office in East Boston that didn't have any money.

1450
02:09:40,104 --> 02:09:45,007
[SPEAKER_18]: Rick, you might remember this, I don't know, but he, one time he came up to make a presentation up to the podium.

1451
02:09:45,448 --> 02:09:49,871
[SPEAKER_18]: He created a plexiglass thing to like a podium so he could hold the thing up.

1452
02:09:49,931 --> 02:09:54,474
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, he was a cat, he was a character and he used to drive this huge Lincoln Continental.

1453
02:09:55,094 --> 02:10:01,519
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we were all relieved when he came one day and he had one of those small little, what do you call those little suckers?

1454
02:10:02,379 --> 02:10:04,761
[SPEAKER_18]: But he was on his way to perfecting.

1455
02:10:05,858 --> 02:10:06,979
[SPEAKER_18]: a way to win at craps.

1456
02:10:07,279 --> 02:10:09,621
[SPEAKER_18]: And he was, he was confident that he had it.

1457
02:10:09,801 --> 02:10:13,943
[SPEAKER_18]: And unfortunately he passed, but nice man.

1458
02:10:14,604 --> 02:10:19,087
[SPEAKER_18]: And he's a true Medford spirit, true Medford spirit.

1459
02:10:19,127 --> 02:10:21,148
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to miss him because, huh?

1460
02:10:22,209 --> 02:10:22,809
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, very nice.

1461
02:10:23,510 --> 02:10:23,990
[SPEAKER_18]: That's that.

1462
02:10:24,550 --> 02:10:25,991
[SPEAKER_18]: And then that's it.

1463
02:10:26,372 --> 02:10:27,372
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. G. Attorney.

1464
02:10:28,033 --> 02:10:29,394
[SPEAKER_09]: The clerk would like to speak on this as well.

1465
02:10:29,414 --> 02:10:31,175
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I do see Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom.

1466
02:10:32,749 --> 02:10:40,374
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilors if you'll indulge me for a minute I just I got a, I got a couple of funny, Dr. Starella stories that I think need to be shared tonight.

1467
02:10:40,934 --> 02:10:44,537
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a really good man he was a kind man he was a funny man.

1468
02:10:44,557 --> 02:10:50,361
[SPEAKER_02]: He, he, he, he had his principles and he had his beliefs and he stuck to them.

1469
02:10:51,422 --> 02:10:53,363
[SPEAKER_02]: And he would come into my office and he would.

1470
02:10:54,724 --> 02:10:59,908
[SPEAKER_02]: for lack of a better phrase, he would harass me about the oath forms that we used to administer all the oaths of office.

1471
02:10:59,948 --> 02:11:05,913
[SPEAKER_02]: He thought they were unwieldy and we've been doing it for 40 years was not the right answer for that one.

1472
02:11:06,353 --> 02:11:07,254
[SPEAKER_02]: He thought we should change it.

1473
02:11:07,754 --> 02:11:15,119
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the middle of one of those discussions about the oath form, we got talking about his dental practice and I happened to mention that my wisdom teeth are still in my mouth.

1474
02:11:16,120 --> 02:11:17,141
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was it.

1475
02:11:17,281 --> 02:11:19,062
[SPEAKER_02]: He pulled out the pen light and he said, let's go.

1476
02:11:20,178 --> 02:11:22,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to open up and he stuck the pen light in my mouth.

1477
02:11:23,099 --> 02:11:26,380
[SPEAKER_02]: It felt like he had his whole head in my mouth as he was sticking the pen light in there.

1478
02:11:27,080 --> 02:11:33,382
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point, everybody on my team in my office decided to come ask me questions while Dr. Strella had his head in my mouth examining my wisdom teeth.

1479
02:11:34,423 --> 02:11:36,723
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was one of the last times he was in my office.

1480
02:11:36,743 --> 02:11:40,184
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm always gonna have a big laugh when I think of Dr. Strella.

1481
02:11:41,045 --> 02:11:41,725
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a good man.

1482
02:11:41,765 --> 02:11:42,505
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a kind man.

1483
02:11:42,565 --> 02:11:46,527
[SPEAKER_02]: He loved this city and he was fun to be around whether you agreed with him or not.

1484
02:11:46,707 --> 02:11:47,787
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna miss him.

1485
02:11:48,908 --> 02:11:49,628
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Clark.

1486
02:11:50,609 --> 02:11:52,910
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Castagnetti, name and address for the record, please.

[SPEAKER_13]: Dr. Starrell is gone.

1493
02:12:17,327 --> 02:12:29,369
[SPEAKER_13]: but he will never be forgotten because he was and is the best patriot who's for the people and for limited taxation here in Medford.

1494
02:12:30,609 --> 02:12:33,570
[SPEAKER_13]: He's the best ever and he's irreplaceable.

1495
02:12:35,530 --> 02:12:38,711
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam President, may I say a short prayer for him and us please?

1496
02:12:38,731 --> 02:12:40,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.

1497
02:12:42,331 --> 02:12:42,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

1503
02:13:10,633 --> 02:13:13,554
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, second by... Second.

1504
02:13:14,613 --> 02:13:16,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli, all those in favor?

1505
02:13:16,294 --> 02:13:16,614
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

1506
02:13:17,115 --> 02:13:17,515
[SPEAKER_09]: Opposed?

1507
02:13:17,635 --> 02:13:19,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Please rise for a brief moment of silence.

1508
02:13:37,488 --> 02:13:38,569
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the only paper correct.

1509
02:13:40,637 --> 02:13:42,458
[SPEAKER_09]: Moving on to public participation.

1510
02:13:42,518 --> 02:13:46,582
[SPEAKER_09]: If there are any members of the public either on Zoom or in person who would like to speak.

1511
02:13:49,864 --> 02:13:54,108
[SPEAKER_18]: Only one.

1512
02:13:55,409 --> 02:14:02,835
[SPEAKER_18]: As I was sitting there, I got 27 text messages from eight different people.

1513
02:14:04,396 --> 02:14:05,296
[SPEAKER_18]: The system goes off.

1514
02:14:06,540 --> 02:14:12,184
[SPEAKER_18]: You can't hear, it stays off, it's distorted, the chiron on the bottom is totally out of control.

1515
02:14:12,545 --> 02:14:15,667
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like on an LSD or something because you can't read what's going on at the bottom.

1516
02:14:16,648 --> 02:14:19,130
[SPEAKER_18]: If the gentleman in there needs help, let's get him some help.

1517
02:14:19,550 --> 02:14:21,672
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's the equipment, let's get the equipment in here.

1518
02:14:22,212 --> 02:14:25,535
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, I can't watch it on TV, that's why I came down tonight.

1519
02:14:26,751 --> 02:14:28,072
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm having a sequence or something.

1520
02:14:28,713 --> 02:14:40,902
[SPEAKER_16]: So we did ask, did you, I guess, I mean, I guess what we heard is that Verizon is working, but there is something going on with Comcast and a piece of equipment at the station that needs to be replaced.

1521
02:14:41,362 --> 02:14:43,023
[SPEAKER_16]: And I believe they're looking into it right now.

1522
02:14:43,584 --> 02:14:50,349
[SPEAKER_16]: So I guess Verizon, you can't see everything's fine, but it's the Comcast connection that they're trying to fix.

1523
02:14:50,469 --> 02:14:51,590
[SPEAKER_18]: Figures it's Comcast.

1524
02:14:53,352 --> 02:14:54,872
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. DeAntonio for raising that.

1525
02:14:55,012 --> 02:14:56,073
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Bears.

1526
02:14:56,093 --> 02:14:59,373
[SPEAKER_05]: Just on that point, the online stream is also working.

1527
02:14:59,393 --> 02:15:00,714
[SPEAKER_05]: So online and Verizon are working.

1528
02:15:00,734 --> 02:15:03,394
[SPEAKER_05]: There's something wrong with the box, Comcast box, basically.

1529
02:15:03,414 --> 02:15:05,915
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to fix it now.

1530
02:15:05,955 --> 02:15:07,555
[SPEAKER_09]: There's no public participation.

1531
02:15:07,575 --> 02:15:12,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing none, moving to records.

1532
02:15:13,217 --> 02:15:15,757
[SPEAKER_09]: The records of the meeting of Vice President Bears.

1533
02:15:22,783 --> 02:15:25,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Soon to be regular Councilor bears.

1534
02:15:30,926 --> 02:15:44,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Just in terms of the reports due, I did receive information from Director O'Connor and Commissioner Moki regarding several items that we had requested information about that are currently on our reports due and deadlines.

1535
02:15:46,727 --> 02:15:49,608
[SPEAKER_05]: For 20-085, the 90-day review on the 360 health and fitness, there were no complaints.

02:16:00,798 --> 02:16:09,262
[SPEAKER_05]: For 20-586, the Fellsway Dunkin' Donuts, there was one complaint regarding masking over a year ago.

1538
02:16:09,742 --> 02:16:19,006
[SPEAKER_05]: Director O'Connor did not feel that it would preclude us, you know, revoking their license.

1539
02:16:19,026 --> 02:16:21,807
[SPEAKER_05]: 20-639, Last Light Tattoo Studio, there were no complaints.
