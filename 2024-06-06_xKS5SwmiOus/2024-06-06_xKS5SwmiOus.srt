00:04:03,306 --> 00:04:03,426
So,

2
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:35,224

00:09:05,495 --> 00:09:19,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Langer-Cohen, Superintendent Edward Vinson, members of the Medford School Committee, distinguished educators, parents and caregivers, family, friends, and most importantly, our graduating class of 2024.

[SPEAKER_05]: Good evening and welcome to the Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School Commencement Ceremony.

5
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:35,734
[SPEAKER_05]: I am Marta Cabral, Principal of Medford High School.

6
00:09:36,575 --> 00:09:45,860
[SPEAKER_05]: At this time, I would like to ask you to please stand for the Pledge of Allegiance recited by one of the voices of Medford High School, Riley Mulvihill.

7
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,944
[SPEAKER_05]: Then please remain standing for the National Anthem performed by Coral Chobbs and Taya Cruz.

8
00:10:11,078 --> 00:10:11,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

9
00:10:14,759 --> 00:10:26,424
[SPEAKER_00]: I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

10
00:10:36,533 --> 00:10:54,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh say can you see by the dawn's early light what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming?

11
00:10:55,147 --> 00:10:58,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Whose broad stripes and bright stars

12
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:11,664
[SPEAKER_03]: through the perilous fight, o'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?

13
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:18,733
[SPEAKER_03]: And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air,

14
00:11:20,572 --> 00:11:28,063
[SPEAKER_03]: gave proof through the night that our flag was still there.

15
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:34,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet

16
00:12:02,577 --> 00:12:10,361
[SPEAKER_05]: At this time it is my honor to introduce members of the Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School community who are present here today.

38
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:16,645
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a day to celebrate not just the end of one chapter, but the beginning of so many more.

39
00:14:17,485 --> 00:14:21,790
[SPEAKER_05]: As you absorb this milestone, I want to take a minute to say congratulations.

40
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:27,896
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations on your perseverance, your dedication, and your incredible achievement.

41
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:37,241
[SPEAKER_05]: You may have heard this quote by someone who grew up not too far from here, Ralph Waldo Emerson, who said, it's not the destination, it's the journey.

42
00:14:38,042 --> 00:14:47,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Although today you've arrived at a much sought after destination, graduation day, your high school years were themselves a journey, not a destination.

43
00:14:47,130 --> 00:14:53,676
[SPEAKER_05]: A time of growth, of discovery, of developing and creating the person you have beautifully become.

44
00:14:54,537 --> 00:14:58,779
[SPEAKER_05]: And through it all, you've shown resilience, adaptability, and potential.

45
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:09,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether in academics, athletics, the arts, or simply in the way you've supported one another, you've demonstrated the kind of leadership that will serve you well in the years to come.

46
00:15:10,746 --> 00:15:12,928
[SPEAKER_05]: As I look out at you, I see pride.

47
00:15:13,589 --> 00:15:17,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Pride in yourselves, in your peers, in the community you've built together.

48
00:15:18,693 --> 00:15:21,355
[SPEAKER_05]: That pride is more than just a feeling.

49
00:15:21,996 --> 00:15:26,160
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a testament to the hard work and heart you've invested in your education.

50
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:34,167
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a reminder that every late night study session, every challenging test, every moment of doubt was worth it.

51
00:15:35,441 --> 00:15:42,965
[SPEAKER_05]: To the parents and caregivers, friends and families here today, I know that seeing your loved ones graduate is a mix of emotions.

52
00:15:43,565 --> 00:15:53,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Yet, as you look at these graduates, remember the people they've become is a direct reflection of the unwavering support and love that you've provided.

53
00:15:54,091 --> 00:15:58,393
[SPEAKER_05]: Be proud of yourselves as well for the role you've played in their journey.

54
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:08,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Class of 2024, please take a moment, stand, turn around, and please show some love to the family and friends here today.

55
00:16:18,430 --> 00:16:22,073
[SPEAKER_05]: Graduates, you can be seated.

56
00:16:24,321 --> 00:16:26,622
[SPEAKER_05]: As you move forward, the world awaits.

57
00:16:27,282 --> 00:16:34,584
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a world full of possibility, of opportunity, of challenges that will push you to grow in the ways that you never thought possible.

58
00:16:35,345 --> 00:16:40,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Embrace those challenges, chase your passions, even when the path isn't easy.

59
00:16:40,766 --> 00:16:45,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Lead with kindness, with empathy, and with the knowledge that you have the power to make a difference.

60
00:16:46,528 --> 00:16:54,267
[SPEAKER_05]: As the class of 2024, I charge you to create a future that is a testament to the incredible potential that lies within each and every one of you.

61
00:16:55,387 --> 00:17:08,094
[SPEAKER_05]: So, as you close this chapter and step into the next, remember that you will always carry the lessons of high school with you, the friendships created, the wisdom gained, and the belief in your own strength.

62
00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:13,697
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations, class of 2024, on this milestone in your magnificent journey.

63
00:17:14,197 --> 00:17:15,558
[SPEAKER_05]: Your story is just beginning.

64
00:17:16,038 --> 00:17:18,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Go out there and make it worth telling.

65
00:17:18,439 --> 00:17:19,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations, Mustangs.

66
00:17:25,106 --> 00:17:31,936
[SPEAKER_05]: It is now my pleasure to invite Mr. Chad Fallon, Principal Director of Medford Vocational Technical High School, to address the class of 2024.

67
00:17:39,346 --> 00:17:48,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening, Madam Mayor, school committee members, faculty, staff, and invited guests, and most importantly, you, our graduates, class of 2024.

68
00:17:49,691 --> 00:18:06,119
[SPEAKER_09]: As your proud principal of Career and Technical Education at Medford High School, otherwise known as the VOC, it is my honor and privilege to join you tonight as you prepare to close one significant chapter of your life and embark on your future, where you'll experience all the amazing things that are ahead of you.

69
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:07,920
[SPEAKER_09]: You are,

70
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:23,591
[SPEAKER_09]: the future electricians, chefs, scientists, programmers, nurses, carpenters, auto specialists, welders, teachers, designers, and entrepreneurs that will pave the way for future students that will take your place at Medford High School.

71
00:18:25,168 --> 00:18:39,634
[SPEAKER_09]: For CTE students, along with completing all academic coursework and meeting all requirements for graduation, 106 of the graduating class tonight have also completed over 900 hours of technical instruction and practical hands-on learning in one of our 15 programs.

72
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:47,617
[SPEAKER_09]: Many of you have also been working all year through our cooperative education program, where many of you will retain a job as soon as tomorrow.

73
00:18:48,942 --> 00:18:54,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Together, we've shared moments of happiness as well as challenging situations that we've overcome together.

74
00:18:55,404 --> 00:18:59,986
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to personally thank you for allowing us to be part of your life these past four years.

75
00:19:01,006 --> 00:19:11,310
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no doubt that you'll do great things and use the experience gained from our school and lessons learned from our caring faculty that will support you when you face challenges or obstacles along the way.

76
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,991
[SPEAKER_09]: Life can be tough, but I have faith that you'll do great things.

77
00:19:16,592 --> 00:19:23,154
[SPEAKER_09]: And remember, as Principal Cabral mentioned, it's about the journey and not the destination, something I remind myself every day.

78
00:19:24,215 --> 00:19:36,840
[SPEAKER_09]: So my closing message to you all tonight is enjoy the moments, surround yourself with people who love you and support you, and don't be afraid to reinvent yourself as many times as it takes to be your best self.

79
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:39,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations to the class of 2024.

80
00:19:45,706 --> 00:19:54,551
[SPEAKER_09]: At this time, I am delighted to call to the podium the class of 2024's choice to give the faculty address, Mr. Nicholas Kane.

81
00:20:05,316 --> 00:20:09,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you to the class of 2024 for selecting me as your faculty speaker.

82
00:20:09,898 --> 00:20:12,760
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so privileged to be a part of this day and of this community.

83
00:20:13,848 --> 00:20:22,035
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say thank you to the families, friends, teachers, class advisors, and to our new administration teams turning this school in bright new directions.

84
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:28,641
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks also to the counselors, to the nurses, and the folks in food services and our security teams.

85
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:34,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to the custodians and the night cleaning crews who keep that old building afloat.

86
00:20:35,627 --> 00:20:41,572
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks to the unsung heroes, administrative assistants like Michael McLaughlin who are the heart of our school community.

87
00:20:46,092 --> 00:20:55,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Graduates, today is a celebration for you, but know that the joy of it is shared by so many of us in the community who are lucky enough to play a small role in your journey to this moment.

88
00:20:56,899 --> 00:21:04,764
[SPEAKER_01]: And what a ride you guys had here, from those classes in Zoom freshman year to this beautiful evening we get to share together here.

89
00:21:06,305 --> 00:21:08,586
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to know that we saw you along the way.

90
00:21:09,427 --> 00:21:10,348
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw you struggle.

91
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:12,149
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw your victories.

92
00:21:12,989 --> 00:21:15,411
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw you make friends, and we saw you lose some friends.

93
00:21:16,343 --> 00:21:19,226
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw you grow beyond yourself as you grew into yourself.

94
00:21:20,087 --> 00:21:27,874
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want you to know that we're so very proud of you for what you've accomplished, for the people you've become, and for the people that you're becoming.

95
00:21:29,195 --> 00:21:33,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm not sure why you picked me to be your faculty speaker, but you did, and I'm grateful.

96
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:37,843
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm gonna share a little secret with you about being a teacher.

97
00:21:38,684 --> 00:21:41,347
[SPEAKER_01]: This seems like a good venue to share secrets.

98
00:21:43,623 --> 00:21:48,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the folks who know this don't say this part out loud, so don't spread it around, but it's true.

99
00:21:49,366 --> 00:21:52,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Being a teacher is the best.

100
00:21:53,507 --> 00:22:02,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, we might run out of water, we have to buy our own supplies from time to time, we have to protest to try to get salaries that match inflation, but that's all just background noise.

101
00:22:03,174 --> 00:22:09,559
[SPEAKER_01]: As a teacher, I get to think creatively every day and to interact with amazing young minds like yours, year after year.

102
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,321
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to reflect on our place in history.

103
00:22:12,962 --> 00:22:22,729
[SPEAKER_01]: And every day I can walk into school knowing that your potential, your perspective, and your kindness will surprise me and broaden my understanding of the world and what's possible.

104
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,351
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't think of another job where that's true.

105
00:22:26,752 --> 00:22:27,773
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not to say it's easy.

106
00:22:28,494 --> 00:22:28,914
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not.

107
00:22:29,735 --> 00:22:30,635
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so hard.

108
00:22:32,025 --> 00:22:40,710
[SPEAKER_01]: but it helps me figure out on a day-to-day and a moment-to-moment basis what's most important when it comes to helping others and living a meaningful life.

109
00:22:42,131 --> 00:22:45,072
[SPEAKER_01]: And the longer we do it, the more rewarding it becomes.

110
00:22:46,153 --> 00:22:51,916
[SPEAKER_01]: Teachers get to see so many young, beautiful minds grow into themselves, and sometimes they come back to visit.

111
00:22:52,696 --> 00:22:57,339
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they come back as school committee members, as city counselors, or as teachers.

112
00:22:59,181 --> 00:23:07,068
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you know this, but your class advisor, Mr. Dello Russo, was a student in my World History I class way back when I was a young teacher.

113
00:23:07,088 --> 00:23:13,893
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of the great joys of my career to see him grow from being a student to a colleague and a friend.

114
00:23:14,914 --> 00:23:19,718
[SPEAKER_01]: He's always willing to take on new challenges and new responsibilities if it means supporting students.

115
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:23,641
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an inspiration, and his generosity is a superpower.

116
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:26,244
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's a funny thing.

117
00:23:27,264 --> 00:23:33,669
[SPEAKER_01]: When he came back to teach, he told me that he still remembered the three class rules we had back when he was in ninth grade in my class.

118
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:35,691
[SPEAKER_01]: These were our three rules.

119
00:23:36,612 --> 00:23:38,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Rule number one was show up.

120
00:23:39,614 --> 00:23:42,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Rule number two was there is no rule number two.

121
00:23:43,577 --> 00:23:45,579
[SPEAKER_01]: And rule number three was don't be a jerk.

122
00:23:47,645 --> 00:23:52,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I must have been a smarter teacher back then, because those are some solid rules to live by, right?

123
00:23:53,406 --> 00:23:55,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Show up, it's so basic, right?

124
00:23:55,727 --> 00:23:56,867
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's so necessary.

125
00:23:57,748 --> 00:24:01,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Show up to school and work for sure, but also show up for each other.

126
00:24:01,949 --> 00:24:03,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Show up for our friends, for our families.

127
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:05,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Show up to the party.

128
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:09,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Show up to the weddings that are coming, to the funerals.

129
00:24:10,711 --> 00:24:15,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Show up for yourself, and for the promises you make to yourself, because you're worth it.

130
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:19,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Rule number two, there is no rule number two.

131
00:24:19,484 --> 00:24:21,465
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just goofy, right?

132
00:24:22,485 --> 00:24:24,446
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a reminder that we're free.

133
00:24:25,246 --> 00:24:27,127
[SPEAKER_01]: We're free to think in new ways.

134
00:24:27,387 --> 00:24:28,828
[SPEAKER_01]: We're free to innovate and to act.

135
00:24:29,368 --> 00:24:32,129
[SPEAKER_01]: We're full of all kinds of unperceived potential.

136
00:24:32,809 --> 00:24:34,970
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no rule number two that's going to hold us back.

137
00:24:36,874 --> 00:24:38,235
[SPEAKER_01]: Rule number three, don't be a jerk.

138
00:24:38,275 --> 00:24:39,716
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just golden, right?

139
00:24:40,036 --> 00:24:42,458
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so easy to recognize when other people are breaking it.

140
00:24:43,158 --> 00:24:45,640
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's easy to admit it when other people call us out on it.

141
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't be a jerk.

142
00:24:48,421 --> 00:24:55,846
[SPEAKER_01]: That means all the little things we know make a difference, like being happy to see each other, like not imposing on others if we can afford to.

143
00:24:57,267 --> 00:25:05,853
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't be a jerk also means occasions like this, when you're given a microphone and an audience, that there's some things that need to be said.

144
00:25:06,829 --> 00:25:08,470
[SPEAKER_01]: We owe it to people we care for.

145
00:25:09,670 --> 00:25:16,032
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that spirit, I want us all to just take a moment and recognize as a community, trans rights are human rights.

146
00:25:17,693 --> 00:25:20,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's recognize together that love is love.

147
00:25:20,514 --> 00:25:21,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy Pride, all.

148
00:25:23,395 --> 00:25:30,658
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's recognize together that we all are or descended from displaced peoples, refugees, immigrants, people brought here against their will.

149
00:25:31,803 --> 00:25:44,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's recognize that we're all gathered here today on land and near the waters that their creator put in the care and the protection of the Wampanoag, the Pawtucket, the Massachusetts, and other tribal nations over time.

150
00:25:45,968 --> 00:25:49,949
[SPEAKER_01]: That our city was built here without permission and is a colonial project.

151
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:59,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Knowing all this, together, let's work for peace, for love, for refuge, and for each other.

152
00:26:01,345 --> 00:26:05,546
[SPEAKER_01]: I also know rule number three, don't be a jerk, means keep your speech short.

153
00:26:07,827 --> 00:26:14,989
[SPEAKER_01]: So in just a few moments, you'll all be heading off in different directions, carrying your experience here along with you to those lives that await you.

154
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:19,491
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to know, I'm so happy to have been a small part of your journey.

155
00:26:20,591 --> 00:26:22,652
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a miracle class of 2024.

156
00:26:23,352 --> 00:26:24,312
[SPEAKER_01]: So congratulations.

157
00:26:24,932 --> 00:26:29,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Now go get to work, promote peace, promote love, and shine your light on the world.

158
00:26:29,954 --> 00:26:30,454
[SPEAKER_01]: I love you guys.

159
00:26:38,948 --> 00:26:40,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Next up, we have your class president.

160
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:56,140
[SPEAKER_11]: This is my villain arc right here, guys.

161
00:27:00,646 --> 00:27:08,571
[SPEAKER_11]: What a special day it is to see so many important people here to join in the celebration of the graduating class of 2024.

162
00:27:15,796 --> 00:27:17,197
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, my fellow Americans.

163
00:27:17,637 --> 00:27:24,682
[SPEAKER_11]: It is with great humility that I speak here today at the inauguration of the President of the United States of America.

164
00:27:25,202 --> 00:27:26,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, sorry, wrong speech.

165
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:40,542
[SPEAKER_11]: Joking aside, it has truly been a privilege and an honor to represent the class of 2024 and the first-rate students here at Medford High School.

166
00:27:41,883 --> 00:27:45,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's give a round of applause to all of our graduates here sitting today.

167
00:27:53,845 --> 00:27:59,947
[SPEAKER_11]: First and foremost, I would like to thank the people who have allowed me the opportunity to stand here before you today.

168
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:13,950
[SPEAKER_11]: My mother and father, who have played an undeniable role in shaping my personality, as well as the wonderful teachers and faculty members that I've had the opportunity of learning under throughout my time within Mefford Public Schools.

169
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:22,597
[SPEAKER_11]: I would also like to express my gratitude to the many vocational shops who have helped make this year's many events possible.

170
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,603
[SPEAKER_11]: From Mr. Spagnola and Mr. Spagnola in the graphic design shop,

171
00:28:31,414 --> 00:28:31,594
[SPEAKER_11]: Ms.

172
00:28:31,634 --> 00:28:40,239
[SPEAKER_11]: Miller in Programming and Web Development, Mr. Jackson in Metal Fab, and Chef P and Chef C in Culinary, just to name a few.

173
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,841
[SPEAKER_11]: They make really good cookies in the bistro, by the way.

174
00:28:44,962 --> 00:28:50,666
[SPEAKER_11]: I would also like to thank my fellow class officers, Brady, Muhammad, and Jacob.

175
00:28:51,546 --> 00:28:52,367
[SPEAKER_11]: Is Jacob here today?

176
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:54,088
[SPEAKER_11]: I heard he forgot about today's meeting.

177
00:28:54,228 --> 00:28:54,748
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, there he is.

178
00:28:54,768 --> 00:28:55,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Is he over there?

179
00:28:58,467 --> 00:29:09,430
[SPEAKER_11]: Lastly, I would like to thank our tireless class advisors, Mr. Dello Russo and Chef P, for all their time and effort in collaborating with the student government to help make this year's events possible.

180
00:29:16,151 --> 00:29:27,114
[SPEAKER_11]: When I first entered senior year, I wasn't sure how much work and responsibility lay ahead of me, nor how many groups and organizations I would join that would help further shape me into who I am today.

181
00:29:28,942 --> 00:29:33,803
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm glad I decided to become involved in just a few school clubs and organizations here.

182
00:29:35,084 --> 00:29:39,405
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's been a delight for all the class advisors and students that I've had the pleasure of meeting with.

183
00:29:41,326 --> 00:29:45,067
[SPEAKER_11]: When I first moved to Medford in second grade, I had difficulties fitting in.

184
00:29:46,107 --> 00:29:52,709
[SPEAKER_11]: But during that time, I met some of my closest friends who are here today, some of whom have been by my side since second grade.

185
00:29:56,752 --> 00:29:59,575
[SPEAKER_11]: giving of themselves to help me feel like I belonged.

186
00:30:00,857 --> 00:30:05,502
[SPEAKER_11]: In middle school, I struggled as well with academics, feeling overwhelmed and alone.

187
00:30:06,142 --> 00:30:14,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Yet during that same time, there were friends, teachers, and fellow students who despite the tasks they faced, they made time for me.

188
00:30:15,742 --> 00:30:28,329
[SPEAKER_11]: Through my time in Medford Public Schools, I've only been able to focus on myself, putting myself first, improving myself, whether academically or socially, because someone else had put themselves second.

189
00:30:29,443 --> 00:30:47,054
[SPEAKER_11]: a teacher, a student, or a community member decided, despite everything that they had on their plate, would put me first, would go that extra mile, take that extra row, attend that extra meeting, or write that extra line of code so that I could be more successful.

190
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:56,961
[SPEAKER_11]: And at the beginning of high school, I wasn't anything like the person you see here staying today, giving speeches, speaking regularly with the high school administration,

191
00:30:58,263 --> 00:31:02,805
[SPEAKER_11]: or advocating for more equitable school budgets at five hour long school committee meetings.

192
00:31:03,365 --> 00:31:05,866
[SPEAKER_11]: I think I may have a couple gray hairs from that one, but.

193
00:31:08,106 --> 00:31:18,750
[SPEAKER_11]: I was only able to become this person in part from all those who believed in me, invested time in me, and were willing to take a risk on someone others may have deemed a potential red flag.

194
00:31:19,390 --> 00:31:21,651
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't worry, I'm just a yellow flag now, so it's all good.

195
00:31:23,294 --> 00:31:31,856
[SPEAKER_11]: Our class, our generation, are facing monumental challenges, which we have the unique burden to solve to avoid dire consequences.

196
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:39,997
[SPEAKER_11]: We were born into a generation forced to solve a multitude of mountainous issues that previous generations created.

197
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:48,759
[SPEAKER_11]: We will be forced to work harder than any other generation to achieve our American dream, only to likely end up in our parents' basement until we're 35.

198
00:31:51,581 --> 00:32:03,448
[SPEAKER_11]: We will have to face these massive debts placed on us so that the next generation, our children and our grandchildren, can enjoy the fruits of our labor and may or may not appreciate the efforts that we put in.

199
00:32:04,089 --> 00:32:04,589
[SPEAKER_11]: Womp womp.

200
00:32:06,946 --> 00:32:13,070
[SPEAKER_11]: So with all this bad news, seemingly impossible to overcome, why should you even get involved?

201
00:32:13,990 --> 00:32:21,415
[SPEAKER_11]: Why should we bring ourselves to face the challenges of our generation, some, well, most, of which we did not even create?

202
00:32:23,055 --> 00:32:33,765
[SPEAKER_11]: I could put on my politician shoes and talk on about the whys, but instead I'll tell you what led me to realize the importance of getting involved, instead of just sitting and watching others talk about the problems.

203
00:32:34,626 --> 00:32:38,790
[SPEAKER_11]: And so, as Mr. Brophy would say, here's my tie into current events.

204
00:32:41,773 --> 00:32:46,238
[SPEAKER_11]: Within the next 50 years, if we are lucky, we will all have more gray hairs.

205
00:32:47,728 --> 00:32:54,892
[SPEAKER_11]: because we will have faced and fought some of the toughest challenges our civilization has seen, both domestically and abroad.

206
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:57,094
[SPEAKER_11]: We must fight climate change.

207
00:32:57,334 --> 00:33:11,142
[SPEAKER_11]: We must address gun violence, end the opioid epidemic, end food insecurity for the world's populations, implement criminal justice reform, preserve our democracy, and most importantly, fix the Potholes and Mefford.

208
00:33:19,338 --> 00:33:31,325
[SPEAKER_11]: So like Sisyphus, say that five times fast, rolling the boulder to the top of the hill only to have it roll right back down, these challenges might seem impossible at first.

209
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:41,911
[SPEAKER_11]: But like those who took their time and a chance on me, the potential red flag, from what I've seen our class face, I'm confident that we can address these challenges head on.

210
00:33:42,491 --> 00:33:43,592
[SPEAKER_11]: Because among other things,

211
00:33:44,392 --> 00:33:55,505
[SPEAKER_11]: We are intelligent, we are resilient, hardworking, considerate, creative, and as many of our parents and guardians will tell you, and teachers, we don't take no for an answer.

212
00:33:58,108 --> 00:34:02,653
[SPEAKER_11]: So I urge you, in whatever careers or future endeavors you choose,

213
00:34:03,803 --> 00:34:09,948
[SPEAKER_11]: to take a chance on someone and put time and effort into things that really matter to you.

214
00:34:10,829 --> 00:34:13,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't only show up just for the money or for the prestige.

215
00:34:14,832 --> 00:34:20,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Put your time, energy, and resources into what you love, your passion.

216
00:34:20,597 --> 00:34:21,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Tackle real challenges.

217
00:34:22,378 --> 00:34:23,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Give back to your community.

218
00:34:23,979 --> 00:34:31,665
[SPEAKER_11]: Stand up to injustices and those who have no one to stand up for themselves so that we may all have a better future and society.

219
00:34:32,446 --> 00:34:36,968
[SPEAKER_11]: Signing off for your last time as class president, I'll see you all at our class reunion.

220
00:34:50,412 --> 00:34:53,793
[SPEAKER_11]: And now for our Honorable Mayor, Lungo-Koehn.

221
00:34:57,915 --> 00:34:58,635
[SPEAKER_06]: Great job, Darren.

222
00:34:58,655 --> 00:34:58,955
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

223
00:35:02,298 --> 00:35:06,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, superintendent, faculty, parents, and of course, our graduates.

224
00:35:08,042 --> 00:35:15,487
[SPEAKER_06]: I will not be long, as I know you can't wait to celebrate with your friends and family after you throw your caps high in the air at the end of this ceremony.

225
00:35:16,465 --> 00:35:21,688
[SPEAKER_06]: First, let me congratulate the class of 2024 on this momentous milestone.

226
00:35:22,609 --> 00:35:27,371
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so proud to be here to celebrate you and all the hard work you've put into the last four years.

227
00:35:28,272 --> 00:35:33,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Graduating from high school is a huge accomplishment, and you all should be very proud of yourselves.

228
00:35:34,355 --> 00:35:41,500
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there were obstacles, challenges, as well as learning transitions that you've had to overcome during these last four years.

229
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,262
[SPEAKER_06]: You entered high school during a pandemic, for goodness sake.

230
00:35:46,331 --> 00:35:52,096
[SPEAKER_06]: and had to navigate a shift in the way the world was operating, in addition to getting acclimated to a new school.

231
00:35:53,257 --> 00:36:03,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Your resiliency and strength are inspiring, and those are gained skills that you will all apply as you move forward beyond Medford High School and into the next chapter of your life.

232
00:36:05,117 --> 00:36:12,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Be ready for anything, continue to be curious, and remember that positive thinking is the first step towards future success.

233
00:36:13,642 --> 00:36:21,226
[SPEAKER_06]: There is nothing you can't do, and I know this because I've watched you all as you graciously have risen to meet your challenges.

234
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:27,750
[SPEAKER_06]: I have all the faith in the world that you will continue to do amazing things and leave your positive mark on the world.

235
00:36:28,730 --> 00:36:33,733
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know your teachers, families, and friends are excited to see what you do next, as am I.

236
00:36:35,128 --> 00:36:38,390
[SPEAKER_06]: If I give you any advice, it's to never be afraid to try.

237
00:36:38,971 --> 00:36:39,431
[SPEAKER_06]: Try it.

238
00:36:39,811 --> 00:36:40,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Try something.

239
00:36:41,092 --> 00:36:42,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Try anything that scares you.

240
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:46,996
[SPEAKER_06]: The best things out there are the things that are the hardest to try.

241
00:36:48,277 --> 00:36:53,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Be kind, compassionate, and accepting to everyone in everything you do.

242
00:36:54,161 --> 00:36:56,463
[SPEAKER_06]: Or as Mr. Kane said, don't be a jerk.

243
00:36:58,277 --> 00:36:59,778
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope I wasn't a jerk in too long.

244
00:36:59,958 --> 00:37:04,041
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll leave you with congratulations again to the class of 2024.

245
00:37:04,262 --> 00:37:05,022
[SPEAKER_06]: Go Mustangs.

246
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:23,216
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a great honor for me to introduce at this time the leader of the Medford public school system, the superintendent of schools, Dr. Maurice Edward Vincent.

247
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:32,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

248
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:36,513
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll try that again.

249
00:37:36,633 --> 00:37:37,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening, everyone.

250
00:37:39,195 --> 00:37:39,936
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

251
00:37:40,416 --> 00:37:47,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, for the end, I'll give you guys all a little opportunity to practice cheering on our wonderful Mustangs.

252
00:37:47,882 --> 00:37:50,584
[SPEAKER_10]: But this evening, I am so happy to be here.

253
00:37:51,605 --> 00:37:56,829
[SPEAKER_10]: I stand here as your proud superintendent congratulating this, the class of 2024.

254
00:37:59,614 --> 00:38:13,918
[SPEAKER_10]: I start by saying thank you, as always, to your parents and your support systems, caregivers, relatives, friends, all of those that championed and stood behind you, pushing you forward.

255
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:19,333
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to personally acknowledge our principals, Ms.

256
00:38:19,373 --> 00:38:27,158
[SPEAKER_10]: Cabral, Mr. Fallon, the wonderful assistant principal team, all the staff at Medford High School.

257
00:38:27,538 --> 00:38:42,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for having a positive impact on this class, the class of 2024, and the staff of the Medford Public Schools that served you in the previous grades, both at elementary school level and the middle school level.

258
00:38:44,554 --> 00:38:49,096
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are here today to celebrate you, the class of 2024.

259
00:38:49,276 --> 00:38:57,660
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to open by saying that I received some feedback from some of the staff last week.

260
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:08,524
[SPEAKER_10]: I had time to talk with them while many of you were dancing and enjoying yourselves last week at the prom.

261
00:39:09,284 --> 00:39:12,686
[SPEAKER_10]: And there was a recurring theme that really struck me.

262
00:39:14,963 --> 00:39:19,646
[SPEAKER_10]: The staff of Medford High School kept saying, this is such a special class.

263
00:39:20,606 --> 00:39:23,348
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a wonderful group of students.

264
00:39:24,388 --> 00:39:25,789
[SPEAKER_10]: We're really going to miss them.

265
00:39:27,010 --> 00:39:33,093
[SPEAKER_10]: I want you to know that you, the class of 2024, truly, truly made an impact.

266
00:39:33,673 --> 00:39:36,875
[SPEAKER_10]: You touched the hearts of your staff, the staff of the school.

267
00:39:38,436 --> 00:39:41,498
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was wonderful just seeing how everyone got along.

268
00:39:42,523 --> 00:39:50,785
[SPEAKER_10]: how you guys supported one another, cheered one another on, whether it was back flips on the dance floor or trying new moves.

269
00:39:51,465 --> 00:39:56,146
[SPEAKER_10]: I want you to know that you made a difference, this class of 2024.

270
00:39:57,846 --> 00:40:10,729
[SPEAKER_10]: So yesterday I had the opportunity to go to the Curtis Tufts graduation, and I wanna share some of my remarks, because those remarks apply to you as well.

271
00:40:12,475 --> 00:40:16,616
[SPEAKER_10]: You are at a crossroads, getting ready to start the next chapter of your life.

272
00:40:17,977 --> 00:40:22,658
[SPEAKER_10]: As you think about the next chapter of your life, think about your future.

273
00:40:23,198 --> 00:40:24,859
[SPEAKER_10]: Dream about your future.

274
00:40:25,459 --> 00:40:27,720
[SPEAKER_10]: So I looked up the word dream.

275
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,301
[SPEAKER_10]: I said, let me look at the definition of it.

276
00:40:31,361 --> 00:40:32,121
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a noun.

277
00:40:33,262 --> 00:40:40,344
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a series of thoughts, images, feelings, or sensations occurring in a person's mind during sleep.

278
00:40:41,408 --> 00:40:45,971
[SPEAKER_10]: a cherished aspiration, ambition, or ideal.

279
00:40:47,672 --> 00:40:58,320
[SPEAKER_10]: As a verb, the verb dream means to indulge in daydreams or even fantasies about something that is greatly desired.

280
00:40:59,628 --> 00:41:04,169
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm encouraging all of you to dream big, not to dream small.

281
00:41:04,989 --> 00:41:07,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Have high expectations for yourself.

282
00:41:08,010 --> 00:41:11,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Today, here we are on this platform celebrating you.

283
00:41:12,071 --> 00:41:16,692
[SPEAKER_10]: And today at Medford High School, there is something unusual happening.

284
00:41:17,632 --> 00:41:22,993
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a valedictorian and a salutatorian that happen to be sisters.

285
00:41:24,827 --> 00:41:26,068
[SPEAKER_10]: That doesn't happen often.

286
00:41:26,448 --> 00:41:27,789
[SPEAKER_10]: They're twins, of course.

287
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:36,293
[SPEAKER_10]: So Oprah and Eleanor, I congratulate you on accomplishing something that doesn't happen often in a lifetime.

288
00:41:42,156 --> 00:41:49,019
[SPEAKER_10]: I want all of you to know, especially as you dream, reach for the stars.

289
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Try to shoot for something that's higher than what you can actually attain.

290
00:41:54,827 --> 00:42:00,713
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that I normally like to quote a poem, and I do have a poem by Langston Hughes, which is about dreams.

291
00:42:01,313 --> 00:42:08,900
[SPEAKER_10]: But I also want you to know that I sat and I reflected on the word dream, and I thought about this acrostic poem.

292
00:42:09,681 --> 00:42:12,764
[SPEAKER_10]: The D, dare to be the change.

293
00:42:14,325 --> 00:42:19,170
[SPEAKER_10]: R, reach for the stars or something that is unattainable.

294
00:42:20,564 --> 00:42:27,545
[SPEAKER_10]: E, excel in college, career, life, work, whatever it is that you're going to do.

295
00:42:29,286 --> 00:42:31,506
[SPEAKER_10]: A, acknowledge your roots.

296
00:42:33,647 --> 00:42:35,187
[SPEAKER_10]: Acknowledge where you come from.

297
00:42:36,247 --> 00:42:37,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Do not forget that.

298
00:42:38,287 --> 00:42:42,388
[SPEAKER_10]: And the M, make a positive difference.

299
00:42:43,588 --> 00:42:45,589
[SPEAKER_10]: Make the world a better place.

300
00:42:47,088 --> 00:42:52,093
[SPEAKER_10]: make Mustang Nation and Medford very proud of you.

301
00:42:53,094 --> 00:42:58,659
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I do want to close and encourage each and every one of you to pursue your dreams.

302
00:42:59,798 --> 00:43:03,899
[SPEAKER_10]: continue to work hard, continue to make a difference in the world.

303
00:43:04,379 --> 00:43:11,300
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember that blue and white will forever run through your veins because you are a Mustang.

304
00:43:11,901 --> 00:43:13,881
[SPEAKER_10]: Bring that Mustang spirit with you.

305
00:43:14,361 --> 00:43:15,221
[SPEAKER_10]: You are a leader.

306
00:43:15,461 --> 00:43:16,381
[SPEAKER_10]: You are kind.

307
00:43:16,822 --> 00:43:18,862
[SPEAKER_10]: You are in front and not behind.

308
00:43:19,982 --> 00:43:22,043
[SPEAKER_10]: You are on top and not the bottom.

309
00:43:25,343 --> 00:43:27,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Here is a poem by Langston Hughes.

310
00:43:27,204 --> 00:43:28,084
[SPEAKER_10]: It's called Dreams.

311
00:43:30,154 --> 00:43:40,120
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold fast to dreams, for if dreams die, life is a broken winged bird that cannot fly.

312
00:43:41,741 --> 00:43:50,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Hold fast to dreams, for when dreams go, life is a barren field frozen with snow.

313
00:43:52,527 --> 00:43:54,047
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to ask Ms.

314
00:43:54,187 --> 00:43:56,209
[SPEAKER_10]: Freitas Haley to come on up and join me.

315
00:43:57,446 --> 00:44:05,008
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to say a special, special congratulations to this, the class of 2024.

316
00:44:06,108 --> 00:44:16,371
[SPEAKER_10]: And in true Mustang fashion, when I say Medford, left side, you say Mustang, right side.

317
00:44:18,612 --> 00:44:19,372
[SPEAKER_10]: One, two, three.

318
00:44:19,752 --> 00:44:20,453
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford.

319
00:44:22,213 --> 00:44:22,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford.

320
00:44:24,514 --> 00:44:25,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford.

321
00:44:27,003 --> 00:44:31,689
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's ask the audience, can we split you in half by the MHS side?

322
00:44:32,570 --> 00:44:36,815
[SPEAKER_10]: One half will say Medford, and one half will say Mustangs.

323
00:44:37,576 --> 00:44:39,258
[SPEAKER_10]: One, two, three, Medford.

324
00:44:39,298 --> 00:44:39,538
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford.

325
00:44:41,521 --> 00:44:42,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford.

326
00:44:47,358 --> 00:44:50,040
[SPEAKER_10]: So when I say Mustang, you say pride.

327
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Mustang.

328
00:44:51,941 --> 00:44:52,842
[SPEAKER_10]: Mustang.

329
00:44:53,743 --> 00:44:54,623
[SPEAKER_10]: Mustang.

330
00:44:55,644 --> 00:44:57,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Congratulations to the class of 2024.

331
00:45:09,694 --> 00:45:15,278
[SPEAKER_09]: At this time, it's my pleasure to invite the top ranked career technical education student,

332
00:45:16,684 --> 00:45:19,006
[SPEAKER_09]: To the podium, please, Mr. Matthew Harris.

333
00:45:25,951 --> 00:45:35,017
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I can compete with that level of enthusiasm, but I'll try my best.

334
00:45:36,478 --> 00:45:44,124
[SPEAKER_08]: So before I begin, I'd like to say that I am incredibly honored and terrified to be up here today.

335
00:45:45,071 --> 00:45:48,353
[SPEAKER_08]: There have been some really incredible speeches, especially you, Darren.

336
00:45:48,373 --> 00:45:49,213
[SPEAKER_08]: That was awesome.

337
00:45:50,074 --> 00:45:59,318
[SPEAKER_08]: The bar has been set very high, so high that I don't think my original plan of reading green eggs and ham to all of you is going to be enough.

338
00:46:00,639 --> 00:46:03,881
[SPEAKER_08]: So instead, I'll try my backup plan, just telling a story.

339
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:05,301
[SPEAKER_08]: How does that sound?

340
00:46:08,063 --> 00:46:11,385
[SPEAKER_08]: So during COVID,

341
00:46:12,412 --> 00:46:15,534
[SPEAKER_08]: I discovered that I had a knack for coding.

342
00:46:16,734 --> 00:46:24,838
[SPEAKER_08]: I was a little software nerd boy, so naturally, when it came time to choose a vocational shop, I chose programming and web development.

343
00:46:26,379 --> 00:46:32,642
[SPEAKER_08]: And then my sophomore year rolled around, and suddenly, building robots seemed pretty cool.

344
00:46:33,903 --> 00:46:41,407
[SPEAKER_08]: And it sure didn't help that robotics and engineering had an amazing new shop, and that half of my friends were in it.

345
00:46:42,898 --> 00:46:51,780
[SPEAKER_08]: So every day, I would see the stuff that my friends would be making in robotics, and I'd think, oh, man, maybe I should have chosen robotics.

346
00:46:52,420 --> 00:46:53,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe I should jump ship.

347
00:46:55,021 --> 00:47:02,622
[SPEAKER_08]: But then, at the same time, I'd think, oh, well, I do really like software, and I don't want to give up that opportunity.

348
00:47:04,323 --> 00:47:09,864
[SPEAKER_08]: So for months and months, I would have this really delightful debate with myself, like every day,

349
00:47:11,414 --> 00:47:20,142
[SPEAKER_08]: And what really frustrated me, as someone who is often very indecisive, was that these two fields, they felt like they were very similar.

350
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:23,185
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, they were separate.

351
00:47:23,986 --> 00:47:26,828
[SPEAKER_08]: And so that means I had to make a choice.

352
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:30,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, fast forward to today.

353
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:33,274
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm graduating from programming and web development.

354
00:47:34,255 --> 00:47:36,978
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd like to think it's pretty clear that I didn't jump ship.

355
00:47:38,902 --> 00:47:47,466
[SPEAKER_08]: But did I just tell my interest in robotics to sit this one out, maybe wait until college, or maybe the next life?

356
00:47:48,406 --> 00:47:48,547
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

357
00:47:49,887 --> 00:47:50,548
[SPEAKER_08]: So what did I do?

358
00:47:50,568 --> 00:47:54,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, instead, I joined the robotics team.

359
00:47:55,610 --> 00:48:01,873
[SPEAKER_08]: And as I got involved in building underwater robots, I realized that this was actually the perfect path for me.

360
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:11,256
[SPEAKER_08]: My experience on the robotics team has taught me a really valuable lesson, other than that building stuff underwater sucks.

361
00:48:12,898 --> 00:48:19,884
[SPEAKER_08]: It's taught me that the intersection where two different fields meet is where life gets really interesting.

362
00:48:21,726 --> 00:48:25,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks to the support and flexibility of both Ms.

363
00:48:25,149 --> 00:48:30,874
[SPEAKER_08]: Miller, my programming teacher, and Mr. Christie, wherever you are, our robotics teacher,

364
00:48:32,136 --> 00:48:40,460
[SPEAKER_08]: I was able to bridge the gap between my interest in programming and robotics by spending my shop time writing code for these robots.

365
00:48:41,741 --> 00:48:46,443
[SPEAKER_08]: And in doing so, I discovered how much I loved being right at that intersection.

366
00:48:48,704 --> 00:48:57,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the greatest work, inventions, and discoveries have been the results of people from distinct fields coming together.

367
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:10,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Think about all the different brains that went into building the phones we all have in our pockets right now, or all the different brains from the wide variety of fields that went into making the cars that we drive every day.

368
00:49:11,746 --> 00:49:20,549
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know that the coolest inventions of the future would definitely be the results of distinct fields coming together in ways that we can't even imagine.

369
00:49:22,649 --> 00:49:26,711
[SPEAKER_08]: And this brings me to something really valuable that I see in the Vogue.

370
00:49:27,912 --> 00:49:33,234
[SPEAKER_08]: flexibility, and a willingness to embrace the intersections between different shops.

371
00:49:34,634 --> 00:49:37,455
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen really cool examples of this all the time.

372
00:49:38,515 --> 00:49:46,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Think about the biodiesel project, a collaboration between biotech, automotive tech, metal fab, and even business, too.

373
00:49:48,839 --> 00:49:56,341
[SPEAKER_08]: And without the flexibility of the VOC and its spirit of collaboration, my experience on the robotics team just would not have been possible.

374
00:49:58,993 --> 00:50:03,196
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it feels a little weird offering advice to all of you.

375
00:50:04,156 --> 00:50:05,237
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not 100 years old.

376
00:50:05,257 --> 00:50:07,778
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't figured life or the universe out.

377
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:11,340
[SPEAKER_08]: And even if I make it to 100, I don't think I'll have it figured out.

378
00:50:12,481 --> 00:50:14,382
[SPEAKER_08]: But if I do, I'll let all of you know, of course.

379
00:50:15,403 --> 00:50:26,890
[SPEAKER_08]: But speaking from my limited experience, what I will say is don't be afraid to embrace the intersection, to be that person that bridges the gap.

380
00:50:28,752 --> 00:50:37,278
[SPEAKER_08]: It might feel weird or uncomfortable at first, but as I've said, life gets really interesting at the intersections.

381
00:50:38,359 --> 00:50:38,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Embrace them.

382
00:50:40,300 --> 00:50:45,664
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that means double majoring in college because you're in love with two different fields.

383
00:50:47,064 --> 00:50:54,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it means becoming a shop teacher down the line because you're really passionate about your trade, but you're also passionate about teaching too.

384
00:50:56,280 --> 00:51:01,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Or maybe it means doing something that I can't even imagine because nobody's even attempted it before.

385
00:51:03,345 --> 00:51:06,687
[SPEAKER_08]: And what I've said doesn't have to just be limited to your career.

386
00:51:07,828 --> 00:51:09,709
[SPEAKER_08]: There are many different intersections you can embrace.

387
00:51:10,269 --> 00:51:15,973
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's your racial, ethnic, gender identity, or maybe it's just where you live.

388
00:51:17,794 --> 00:51:24,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't feel like you have to change your interests or who you are to fit neatly in a little box.

389
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Embrace being weird.

390
00:51:28,901 --> 00:51:30,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Embrace being difficult.

391
00:51:31,683 --> 00:51:32,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Embrace the intersections.

392
00:51:33,444 --> 00:51:33,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

393
00:51:43,449 --> 00:51:52,994
[SPEAKER_05]: Offering the salutatory address as salutatorian of the class of 2024 is Eleanor Nicarra, who will be attending Harvard University in the fall.

394
00:52:03,462 --> 00:52:04,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Ms.

395
00:52:04,143 --> 00:52:08,066
[SPEAKER_07]: Cabral, for the introduction and everything you do for the students of the school.

396
00:52:09,207 --> 00:52:14,491
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, parents, teachers, esteemed guests, and of course, my fellow graduates.

397
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:21,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm honored to be speaking before you today as a part of the celebration of Medford High School's graduating class of 2024.

398
00:52:23,686 --> 00:52:25,968
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to begin with a moment of gratitude.

399
00:52:26,869 --> 00:52:43,883
[SPEAKER_07]: On behalf of all the graduates here today, I extend a warm thank you to our superintendent, our principal and our vice principals, our guidance counselors, and all other administrators who work behind the scenes to keep the school running smoothly and to ensure the success of each student.

400
00:52:45,168 --> 00:52:51,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you to the parents and guardians present who support and believe in us even when we do not believe in ourselves.

401
00:52:53,072 --> 00:53:03,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Last but certainly not least, thank you to the faculty members who work tirelessly before and after hours to provide us the education that every child dreams of.

402
00:53:03,917 --> 00:53:06,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Your tenacity and dedication do not go unnoticed.

403
00:53:08,678 --> 00:53:17,264
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of faculty, after I was assigned to write and perform this salutatory speech, I visited my physics teacher, Dr. Wadness, for insight.

404
00:53:18,305 --> 00:53:24,969
[SPEAKER_07]: I asked him, what could I possibly say that would hopefully have an impact on the thousands of attendees here?

405
00:53:25,970 --> 00:53:28,672
[SPEAKER_07]: He responded, teach them an important lesson.

406
00:53:29,673 --> 00:53:31,694
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm taking his advice literally.

407
00:53:32,455 --> 00:53:34,276
[SPEAKER_07]: Brace yourselves for a minute of physics.

408
00:53:36,149 --> 00:53:44,554
[SPEAKER_07]: A quark, spelled Q-U-A-R-K, is a simple elemental particle and the building block of all visible matter in the universe.

409
00:53:45,534 --> 00:53:54,079
[SPEAKER_07]: The radius of a quark is smaller than 43 billion billionths of a centimeter, about a million times smaller than a grain of sand.

410
00:53:55,327 --> 00:54:09,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Now what physicists do with these particles is they accelerate them to 99.999% the speed of light in huge 17-mile-long machines made of superconducting magnets called particle accelerators.

411
00:54:11,734 --> 00:54:15,596
[SPEAKER_07]: You're probably wondering, what does this quark nonsense have to do with me?

412
00:54:16,876 --> 00:54:20,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Truth be told, every one of us here acts as a particle.

413
00:54:21,397 --> 00:54:31,264
[SPEAKER_07]: What I haven't told you about these quarks is that while they bounce around at amazing speeds, some, a very small percentage, happen to collide.

414
00:54:32,425 --> 00:54:35,508
[SPEAKER_07]: United for a brief millisecond, they interact.

415
00:54:36,989 --> 00:54:39,831
[SPEAKER_07]: Imagine two glass marbles smashing against each other.

416
00:54:40,932 --> 00:54:48,858
[SPEAKER_07]: Now multiply that collision by 150, leaving us with 300 marbles, each of them representing one of us.

417
00:54:51,860 --> 00:54:54,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Like these particles, we're all united here by chance.

418
00:54:55,983 --> 00:55:01,907
[SPEAKER_07]: Several graduates have families like mine who immigrated across the globes in hopes of a better future.

419
00:55:03,128 --> 00:55:08,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Many students have gone through the Medford public school system and followed their path here to Medford High School.

420
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:16,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Others moved from city to city and finally decided to settle in Medford, where they now proudly call home.

421
00:55:18,294 --> 00:55:23,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Regardless of where we come from, we are united by our shared collisions within the walls of our school.

422
00:55:24,579 --> 00:55:27,921
[SPEAKER_07]: We have experienced the highest of highs and the lowest of lows together.

423
00:55:28,942 --> 00:55:38,889
[SPEAKER_07]: We forged connections as we bounced from class to class, bonding over the struggles of finding open bathrooms and having to layer up when walking through the overpass during the winter.

424
00:55:40,404 --> 00:55:48,847
[SPEAKER_07]: We've made friends we'll never forget at the black lab tables in our science classes, and discovered a newfound love for playing ping pong in the senior caf.

425
00:55:50,248 --> 00:56:00,251
[SPEAKER_07]: We have made memories that will last a lifetime at prom, homecoming, and formals, shimmying to Party in the USA and Mr. Brightside like our lives depended on it.

426
00:56:02,132 --> 00:56:04,193
[SPEAKER_07]: But what happens after the collision?

427
00:56:05,270 --> 00:56:11,714
[SPEAKER_07]: What happens after we clean out our lockers and we say goodbye to the teachers who have taught us all that we now know?

428
00:56:13,174 --> 00:56:19,178
[SPEAKER_07]: What happens after we commit to college or start the job search or pack our suitcases for gap year travel?

429
00:56:20,499 --> 00:56:28,823
[SPEAKER_07]: After we wave goodbye to our friends and fellow classmates, some of whom will move across the state, the country, or even the world at the end of the summer?

430
00:56:29,964 --> 00:56:31,125
[SPEAKER_07]: After four years together?

431
00:56:32,335 --> 00:56:36,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Four years, it sounds like a long time, but really, it's 5% of our lives.

432
00:56:37,659 --> 00:56:46,566
[SPEAKER_07]: Comparable to the blink of an eye, to the time that particles interact before rebounding just as fast as they met, never to cross paths again.

433
00:56:48,647 --> 00:56:50,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Yet, there is good news.

434
00:56:50,989 --> 00:56:55,433
[SPEAKER_07]: The good news is that humans are made of quarks, but we do not have to act like them.

435
00:56:56,932 --> 00:57:07,380
[SPEAKER_07]: After we disperse from Medford High, we will not disappear into the nothingness of the universe, and our relationships that we have made here do not only exist in the time vacuum that was high school.

436
00:57:09,222 --> 00:57:11,103
[SPEAKER_07]: So take charge of your future courses.

437
00:57:11,724 --> 00:57:13,886
[SPEAKER_07]: We all have power over our trajectories.

438
00:57:14,786 --> 00:57:15,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Stay connected.

439
00:57:16,368 --> 00:57:17,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Spend holidays together.

440
00:57:18,209 --> 00:57:21,432
[SPEAKER_07]: Grab lunch at the tavern and an ice cream cone at Colleen's.

441
00:57:22,452 --> 00:57:25,356
[SPEAKER_07]: put the many computers you carry in your pockets to use.

442
00:57:25,916 --> 00:57:29,240
[SPEAKER_07]: And remember that each one of us here is only a phone call away.

443
00:57:30,462 --> 00:57:36,088
[SPEAKER_07]: Graduates, make sure that the goodbyes you impart today are not forever, but temporary.

444
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:39,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Congratulations, graduates, and don't be a stranger.

445
00:57:40,133 --> 00:57:40,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

446
00:57:50,908 --> 00:57:56,812
[SPEAKER_05]: At this time, please join me in welcoming the valedictorian of the class of 2024, Ms.

447
00:57:56,952 --> 00:57:57,933
[SPEAKER_05]: Oprah Nakira.

448
00:57:58,554 --> 00:58:01,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Oprah will be attending Harvard University in the fall.

449
00:58:11,249 --> 00:58:12,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Which one are you?

450
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:18,711
[SPEAKER_07]: These four mere words form one of the most annoying questions to ask an identical twin.

451
00:58:19,471 --> 00:58:23,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Second only to, can twins actually feel each other's pain?

452
00:58:24,972 --> 00:58:33,314
[SPEAKER_07]: While the odds of being an identical twin are one in 200, the odds of guessing their identities correctly is exactly 100 times that.

453
00:58:35,492 --> 00:58:47,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Despite these relatively good odds, people often hesitate to guess, whether it's out of respect, not wanting to be offensive, or simply because they do not wish to make a choice.

454
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:56,744
[SPEAKER_07]: Ironically enough, we, the Medford High School graduating class of 2024, are all twinning today.

455
00:58:58,125 --> 00:59:04,529
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, take a second look to your left and to your right, to your peers and to the classmates sitting next to you.

456
00:59:05,970 --> 00:59:12,053
[SPEAKER_07]: To the people you have spent the last four, six, eight, 10, or even 12 years with.

457
00:59:13,234 --> 00:59:18,537
[SPEAKER_07]: To the friends who have been with you through the thick and the thin and supported you through the highs and the lows.

458
00:59:19,757 --> 00:59:32,644
[SPEAKER_07]: To the people who have guided you through countless decisions, like whether or not to break up with your boyfriend, what outfit to wear to the football game, and most importantly, which Quizlet to use for your homework assignment.

459
00:59:34,315 --> 00:59:38,737
[SPEAKER_07]: While the answer to these decisions are up to interpretation, one thing's for sure.

460
00:59:39,817 --> 00:59:41,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Life demands decisions.

461
00:59:43,018 --> 00:59:48,901
[SPEAKER_07]: We make countless choices every single day, and these choices have helped form our unique identities.

462
00:59:50,121 --> 00:59:54,883
[SPEAKER_07]: While we may not realize it, we have been asking ourselves which one since we were little.

463
00:59:56,107 --> 01:00:08,855
[SPEAKER_07]: In the blink of an eye, which toys should I bring to show and tell, and which kids should I marry on the playground has quickly turned into which AP class should I take and which college should I commit to.

464
01:00:11,256 --> 01:00:24,805
[SPEAKER_07]: As we transition into this new chapter of our lives, we are sure to be bombarded with a slew of choices we may be forced to make on our own, or if we are lucky, with a support system we have built around us.

465
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:33,647
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, unlike guessing which twin is which, the odds of making the right choice are not fixed at 50-50.

466
01:00:35,349 --> 01:00:42,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether we are choosing a college major, a workplace, or a life partner, we will make some of the hardest choices we have ever made.

467
01:00:43,657 --> 01:00:50,103
[SPEAKER_07]: There is, however, one choice that will always be the easiest to make, being the best versions of ourselves.

468
01:00:51,812 --> 01:01:02,240
[SPEAKER_07]: As we make these decisions in the future, let us remember the core values like integrity, generosity, and compassion that characterize our graduating class.

469
01:01:03,441 --> 01:01:20,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Let us remember the commitment to addressing climate change, social justice, and anti-violence campaigns, like walkouts for increased school safety, and speeches that advocate for equitable funding that our generation has spearheaded through social media and activism.

470
01:01:21,713 --> 01:01:33,863
[SPEAKER_07]: Most importantly, let us remember that the sum of our decisions has the power to transform our future, not only for ourselves, but also for our younger siblings and for generations to come.

471
01:01:35,985 --> 01:01:46,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Before I depart, I feel it is necessary to extend thanks to all of the esteemed faculty, family, and distinguished guests who have guided us through these past four years.

472
01:01:47,134 --> 01:01:50,317
[SPEAKER_07]: Without you all, this rite of passage simply wouldn't be possible.

473
01:01:51,636 --> 01:01:58,301
[SPEAKER_07]: I would like to thank my sister, Eleanor, for being my biggest motivator and the best prank partner I could ask for.

474
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:09,389
[SPEAKER_07]: My friends and family for their unwavering support and being the funniest people I will ever meet, and my family members and parents to whom I owe all of my success.

475
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:15,614
[SPEAKER_07]: Lastly, I would like to thank Medford High itself for the countless memories.

476
01:02:17,015 --> 01:02:20,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Whether it's Dr. Wanus getting ruthlessly pied in the face,

477
01:02:21,354 --> 01:02:39,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Brophy unknowingly sitting on his putty, or the iconic video of Mr. Cullen running through the doors of the third floor overpass, Medford High has imparted unto all of us countless memories we will cherish and that will connect us long after we leave its halls.

478
01:02:41,531 --> 01:02:46,495
[SPEAKER_07]: As Taylor Swift once sang, it is the end of a decade, but the start of an age.

479
01:02:47,679 --> 01:02:51,662
[SPEAKER_07]: to the Medford High School's graduating class of 2024, congratulations.

480
01:02:52,202 --> 01:02:53,463
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's to our next chapter.

481
01:03:07,292 --> 01:03:11,975
[SPEAKER_05]: And now, for the moment that we've been waiting for, the presentation of diplomas.

482
01:03:16,579 --> 01:03:26,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Members of the school committee, I'm pleased to certify that the following students have fulfilled all the course requirements of Medford High School and Medford Vocational Technical High School.

483
01:03:26,942 --> 01:03:36,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Graduates' names will be recited by the class of 2024 senior class advisors, Mr. Christopher Dello Russo and Mr. Ethan Pearlstein.

484
01:03:58,186 --> 01:03:59,347
[SPEAKER_11]: Just give me a sign when to go.

485
01:03:59,367 --> 01:03:59,687
[SPEAKER_11]: Good to go?

486
01:04:18,459 --> 01:04:18,679
