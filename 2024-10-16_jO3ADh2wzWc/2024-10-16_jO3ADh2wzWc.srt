00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:34,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, everyone, and welcome to your show, Medford Happenings, a show for and about the city of Medford.

2
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:49,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, we got a very, very special guest with us, Mr. Rich Cormier, who was a teacher at the electrical department at the Medford Vocational Technical High School.

3
00:00:49,193 --> 00:00:51,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Rick, thank you for coming to the show.

4
00:00:51,774 --> 00:00:52,234
[SPEAKER_04]: My pleasure.

5
00:00:52,255 --> 00:00:52,535
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

6
00:00:52,755 --> 00:00:53,735
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great to have you.

7
00:00:55,367 --> 00:01:05,920
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of great things happen at the vocational school and Rich is here to give us some good examples of exactly what's going on at this great school.

8
00:01:06,501 --> 00:01:11,167
[SPEAKER_04]: So Rich, first question I'd have to ask you is how did you get into this?

9
00:01:12,377 --> 00:01:14,579
[SPEAKER_04]: The teaching end, and how long have you been doing it?

10
00:01:15,019 --> 00:01:16,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually kind of by accident.

11
00:01:17,261 --> 00:01:18,622
[SPEAKER_05]: I had always thought about teaching.

12
00:01:18,642 --> 00:01:19,923
[SPEAKER_05]: I graduated from here in 1975.

13
00:01:20,764 --> 00:01:23,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I went on and had a career for about 30 years.

14
00:01:24,327 --> 00:01:31,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of my apprentices, I bumped into them one night, Tony Puccio, friend of the show, mentioned that he had been teaching evening school.

15
00:01:31,873 --> 00:01:34,595
[SPEAKER_05]: and told me I should give them a call, because they were always looking for teachers.

16
00:01:35,035 --> 00:01:36,096
[SPEAKER_05]: It was something I wanted to try.

17
00:01:36,536 --> 00:01:39,538
[SPEAKER_05]: So I gave them a call, and they were dumb enough to hire me.

18
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:45,643
[SPEAKER_05]: And the night school was here at the high school, and it turns out one of the electrical teachers was retiring.

19
00:01:46,443 --> 00:01:53,969
[SPEAKER_05]: And so Tom Ritchie, who was the lead teacher at the time, came and found me one night and asked me if I was interested in getting into this full time.

20
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:58,510
[SPEAKER_05]: And it took a lot of thinking because you take a massive pay cut when you do something like that.

21
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,190
[SPEAKER_05]: Teaching doesn't pay what being an electrician pays.

22
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:04,211
[SPEAKER_05]: So my wife and I decided it would be a good move.

23
00:02:04,451 --> 00:02:07,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Time for me to leave the trade and do something different with my life.

24
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:10,852
[SPEAKER_05]: And so at the age of 50, I figured out what I wanted to be when I grew up.

25
00:02:11,892 --> 00:02:13,412
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I've been doing that now since 2007.

26
00:02:13,452 --> 00:02:17,093
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been doing, this is my 18th year of teaching.

27
00:02:17,933 --> 00:02:19,753
[SPEAKER_05]: Something I love, I'm very passionate about it.

28
00:02:20,093 --> 00:02:21,674
[SPEAKER_05]: I still do the nighttime teaching also.

29
00:02:22,494 --> 00:02:24,034
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just something I really enjoy.

30
00:02:24,572 --> 00:02:25,935
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great, great to hear.

31
00:02:26,115 --> 00:02:27,237
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy.

32
00:02:27,398 --> 00:02:31,947
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's nice to be able to make a career change like that and enjoy what you're doing.

33
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,336
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess my next question based on your answer is,

34
00:02:37,608 --> 00:02:41,252
[SPEAKER_04]: 18 years, what's changed over the last 18 years at the vocational school?

35
00:02:41,272 --> 00:02:45,957
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, when I first started teaching, I would ask the freshmen to raise their hands.

36
00:02:45,977 --> 00:02:49,901
[SPEAKER_05]: How many of you got poked fun of because you were chosen to vocational school?

37
00:02:49,921 --> 00:02:50,782
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'd all raise their hands.

38
00:02:51,223 --> 00:02:53,966
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody was given a hard time, just like I was when I was a kid.

39
00:02:54,506 --> 00:02:57,490
[SPEAKER_05]: You must be an idiot, you're going to the voc, you can't go to college, dummy.

40
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:07,313
[SPEAKER_05]: And as it turns out, what I learned early on was that all those people that laughed at me for going to the Volk, I ended up working in their houses and charging pretty good money for doing things for them.

41
00:03:07,713 --> 00:03:08,593
[SPEAKER_05]: So that worked out pretty well.

42
00:03:09,473 --> 00:03:10,954
[SPEAKER_05]: And I explained that to the students.

43
00:03:10,994 --> 00:03:12,454
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, you know, this is going to change your life.

44
00:03:12,494 --> 00:03:15,195
[SPEAKER_05]: This is change your life money that you can make as an electrician.

45
00:03:15,335 --> 00:03:16,075
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a good paying job.

46
00:03:16,675 --> 00:03:19,516
[SPEAKER_05]: So we started out as almost like second class citizens.

47
00:03:19,996 --> 00:03:25,018
[SPEAKER_05]: And now the vocational school, my first class, I had six sophomores in my first class when I came here.

48
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:31,021
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I have 22 with a waiting list of four, and that's routine, and that's the entire school's that way.

49
00:03:31,801 --> 00:03:39,725
[SPEAKER_05]: The entire school has grown from graduating 60 or 80 students a year to well over 200 students a year graduate from the VOC.

50
00:03:40,306 --> 00:03:42,967
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're leaving and they're staying in the trade.

51
00:03:43,467 --> 00:03:51,812
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say a good 35% of the students stay within the trade that they graduate from, which is pretty good numbers, because I don't think colleges has that number.

52
00:03:52,672 --> 00:03:52,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

53
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:54,135
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's great.

54
00:03:54,215 --> 00:03:55,277
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great to hear that.

55
00:03:55,999 --> 00:03:58,985
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great to know that, you know, the job that's getting done here.

56
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:05,614
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if a student wanted to get in here, right, what's the process?

57
00:04:05,694 --> 00:04:07,915
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the test required?

58
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:08,696
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, what do they need?

59
00:04:08,716 --> 00:04:09,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they need a license?

60
00:04:09,877 --> 00:04:10,517
[SPEAKER_04]: How do they do it?

61
00:04:10,677 --> 00:04:16,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we are one of the very few in the state where we're a city-owned vocational school.

62
00:04:16,702 --> 00:04:18,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Many of the vocational schools are regional.

63
00:04:18,943 --> 00:04:21,225
[SPEAKER_05]: And that means they have numerous cities that pay into them.

64
00:04:21,645 --> 00:04:22,946
[SPEAKER_05]: And the students come from all over.

65
00:04:23,287 --> 00:04:24,788
[SPEAKER_05]: In Medford, we have just our own students.

66
00:04:25,408 --> 00:04:27,550
[SPEAKER_05]: We have, in the past, taken students from out of the city.

67
00:04:28,150 --> 00:04:32,754
[SPEAKER_05]: However, we have such a demand now in our own city, we don't have room for people from outside.

68
00:04:33,735 --> 00:04:35,196
[SPEAKER_05]: We used to send students to Minuteman.

69
00:04:35,236 --> 00:04:43,503
[SPEAKER_05]: They would go to Minuteman because the rule is if you don't have a program and another school does, your city has to pay for a student to go to that school.

70
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:46,126
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now we have as many programs as Minuteman.

71
00:04:46,526 --> 00:04:48,227
[SPEAKER_05]: And students are choosing to stay here in Medford.

72
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:50,810
[SPEAKER_05]: So as a freshman, they come in and they choose.

73
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:55,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Do they want to take vocational rotations, an exploratory course, we call it?

74
00:04:56,154 --> 00:05:01,201
[SPEAKER_05]: And now a freshman comes in, and they sample all 15 programs that we have.

75
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:08,931
[SPEAKER_05]: They do a four-day rotation, and at the end of the second quarter, they choose which one they want to stay in.

76
00:05:09,511 --> 00:05:13,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of them will choose to go to the high school, and some will choose to stay in the vocational school.

77
00:05:14,137 --> 00:05:15,338
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's when we start building them.

78
00:05:15,618 --> 00:05:21,542
[SPEAKER_05]: From that point on, from the third quarter on, for half a year, they're in a program and they get all the beginning stuff.

79
00:05:21,562 --> 00:05:22,522
[SPEAKER_05]: They get all the safety.

80
00:05:22,842 --> 00:05:24,143
[SPEAKER_05]: They get all the basics.

81
00:05:24,543 --> 00:05:26,304
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked to them about a lot of theory that time.

82
00:05:26,865 --> 00:05:27,905
[SPEAKER_05]: And they get to use the tools.

83
00:05:28,766 --> 00:05:34,009
[SPEAKER_05]: And so for one period a day, you know, the high school has a six-day schedule.

84
00:05:34,049 --> 00:05:35,750
[SPEAKER_05]: The Vokes have a five-day schedule.

85
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:37,551
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a whole other problem for another day.

86
00:05:39,096 --> 00:05:46,684
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, they come in and they learn how to use the tools, and they learn basic circuits, and then by the time sophomore year starts, they're ready to get going.

87
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:50,808
[SPEAKER_05]: So a student will spend the four days in a rotation, try them all out.

88
00:05:50,928 --> 00:05:53,350
[SPEAKER_05]: I ask them all the same question, what do you think you'll be next year?

89
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,371
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of them don't know.

90
00:05:54,952 --> 00:05:58,796
[SPEAKER_05]: And we tell them, well, you've got 15 choices to make, plus the high school.

91
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:02,199
[SPEAKER_05]: So they actually, come February, they have 16 choices that they can look at.

92
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,005
[SPEAKER_05]: and they make their decisions and we keep a lot of them.

93
00:06:06,265 --> 00:06:08,409
[SPEAKER_05]: We lose a few, like I think I started with 24.

94
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:13,977
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple of them decided to go to the high school, but then I grabbed another couple, they came in, so it worked out pretty well.

95
00:06:14,438 --> 00:06:16,722
[SPEAKER_05]: And every one of the shops in here does the same thing.

96
00:06:17,352 --> 00:06:17,692
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

97
00:06:18,052 --> 00:06:19,713
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm on a waiting list.

98
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:21,113
[SPEAKER_05]: What does that mean?

99
00:06:21,353 --> 00:06:22,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly what does that mean?

100
00:06:22,713 --> 00:06:23,934
[SPEAKER_05]: So we grade the students.

101
00:06:24,454 --> 00:06:26,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Each teacher grades the student on their four days.

102
00:06:27,355 --> 00:06:28,295
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a very strict thing.

103
00:06:28,335 --> 00:06:30,175
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically, did they show up?

104
00:06:30,375 --> 00:06:31,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Did they show up on time?

105
00:06:32,056 --> 00:06:34,196
[SPEAKER_05]: And were they interested in the trade?

106
00:06:35,137 --> 00:06:35,717
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a scale of 12.

107
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,778
[SPEAKER_05]: You get three points a day for the four days.

108
00:06:40,698 --> 00:06:47,161
[SPEAKER_05]: And we look at that and we say, all right, now the student did really well in that class, gets decent grades.

109
00:06:47,461 --> 00:06:48,442
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have to get all A's.

110
00:06:48,982 --> 00:06:50,082
[SPEAKER_05]: B's and C's are fine.

111
00:06:51,403 --> 00:06:52,663
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can't be a knucklehead.

112
00:06:53,044 --> 00:06:57,626
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't be a person who gets a lot of cut classes, not just us.

113
00:06:58,246 --> 00:07:03,869
[SPEAKER_05]: Throughout the high school career, the whole freshman year, we look at their attendance, we look at their overall attendance.

114
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:05,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they a person who's never been to school?

115
00:07:05,549 --> 00:07:08,711
[SPEAKER_05]: Because think about this, we're training them for a career.

116
00:07:09,431 --> 00:07:10,712
[SPEAKER_05]: not to be going to college.

117
00:07:11,392 --> 00:07:13,954
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you're on a career, you've got to be on time for your job, right?

118
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:18,617
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we try to push that on them, explain to them that being on time starts right now.

119
00:07:19,198 --> 00:07:21,159
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you made this choice to be in the vocational school.

120
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:23,981
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to do things our way, which means you've got to be on time.

121
00:07:24,021 --> 00:07:25,782
[SPEAKER_05]: And that doesn't mean just for my class.

122
00:07:25,822 --> 00:07:28,124
[SPEAKER_05]: That means in the morning, you've got to be on time.

123
00:07:28,144 --> 00:07:33,608
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know, you talk to the kids, especially when I have my own, and I'll say to them, you know, why are you late?

124
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:38,511
[SPEAKER_05]: And when the answer starts out, well, my mother, well, my sister, no, no, that's not a reason.

125
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:39,191
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a bus.

126
00:07:39,712 --> 00:07:42,654
[SPEAKER_05]: If your mother can't get you to school on time, your sister can't get you, take the bus.

127
00:07:43,854 --> 00:07:45,976
[SPEAKER_05]: So we look at the attendance.

128
00:07:46,056 --> 00:07:46,856
[SPEAKER_05]: We look at their grades.

129
00:07:47,337 --> 00:07:50,839
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the people that didn't make it, it doesn't mean they're bad people.

130
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:54,702
[SPEAKER_05]: It just means that maybe somewhere along the line, they didn't do everything the right way.

131
00:07:55,932 --> 00:08:02,317
[SPEAKER_05]: So they may end up in high school, or they may end up in a trade or in a program that isn't quite populated yet.

132
00:08:02,477 --> 00:08:08,521
[SPEAKER_05]: So we still, even though we're very popular, there are some areas where they could use more students.

133
00:08:09,042 --> 00:08:12,985
[SPEAKER_05]: And so maybe the student will filter down to that one, and if they don't like that, then they go to the high school.

134
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:17,108
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's, not like we're gonna throw them on the street, they have something to do, it may not be their first choice.

135
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:19,530
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so it's just not their first choice, that's all.

136
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,992
[SPEAKER_05]: And we tell them that right up front, we explain what they need to do.

137
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:30,713
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, so years ago, not that many years ago, but a few years ago, I was in the co-op program.

138
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:32,354
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a long time ago.

139
00:08:32,414 --> 00:08:32,974
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it wasn't.

140
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:34,734
[SPEAKER_04]: It just seemed like yesterday.

141
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:38,515
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyhow, does the co-op program still exist?

142
00:08:38,675 --> 00:08:39,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, absolutely.

143
00:08:40,596 --> 00:08:47,166
[SPEAKER_05]: So this year my group is down to I think 13 seniors and already we have six out on co-op.

144
00:08:48,368 --> 00:08:53,175
[SPEAKER_05]: Different companies, local companies too, Pucho Electric has taken a couple of my guys.

145
00:08:53,997 --> 00:08:54,918
[SPEAKER_05]: Companies are

146
00:08:55,639 --> 00:09:00,742
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a company called Facilico, Brian Regan, a graduate of the program, Steve Nardone, who's a graduate.

147
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,223
[SPEAKER_05]: He has a couple of our kids.

148
00:09:02,624 --> 00:09:05,325
[SPEAKER_05]: And I actually have a couple of students working in the local union.

149
00:09:05,786 --> 00:09:09,448
[SPEAKER_05]: They hire them, they call them wire men or something like that.

150
00:09:09,628 --> 00:09:15,192
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're working for a union company, which we have a decent partnership with the union.

151
00:09:15,892 --> 00:09:21,376
[SPEAKER_05]: They usually give us a scholarship opportunity for two of our students, where as long as they take the exam,

152
00:09:22,276 --> 00:09:23,637
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll take two of our students right in.

153
00:09:23,677 --> 00:09:26,418
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't have to do the interview process or any of that stuff.

154
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:27,359
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'll do that.

155
00:09:27,419 --> 00:09:29,140
[SPEAKER_05]: They do that with a lot of vocational schools around.

156
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:37,985
[SPEAKER_05]: The leadership in the 103 realized one day that they were taking in all these new people, these new apprentices who knew nothing.

157
00:09:38,005 --> 00:09:40,867
[SPEAKER_05]: And they had these vocational schools with kids that were trained.

158
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:42,888
[SPEAKER_05]: At least they knew the tools, the parts.

159
00:09:43,308 --> 00:09:44,969
[SPEAKER_05]: So they've been taking advantage of that.

160
00:09:45,469 --> 00:09:46,770
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've had a good partnership with them.

161
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,592
[SPEAKER_05]: But they also go into work for companies that are non-union.

162
00:09:50,492 --> 00:09:55,354
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to find a balance to tell the students, hey, there's pros and cons on both sides.

163
00:09:55,934 --> 00:10:00,016
[SPEAKER_05]: I never worked in the union, I did okay for 30 years and so did some of the other teachers.

164
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:02,077
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have to see both sides of the coin.

165
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:10,420
[SPEAKER_05]: So on co-op, they go to work for a week, they make anywhere between $600 and $800 and then the following week they come back to school, they do all their academics.

166
00:10:10,981 --> 00:10:14,102
[SPEAKER_05]: They do all the academics as the high school, they do it in half the time.

167
00:10:14,682 --> 00:10:17,243
[SPEAKER_05]: So they double up their classes on their academic week.

168
00:10:17,823 --> 00:10:19,144
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't do a lot of electives.

169
00:10:19,224 --> 00:10:21,705
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't really do a language unless they want to do it online.

170
00:10:22,525 --> 00:10:25,006
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't take AP courses on the AB week.

171
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:27,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of our programs do half-day schedules.

172
00:10:28,407 --> 00:10:34,009
[SPEAKER_05]: For instance, if you're going to go into college, a program like robotics and engineering, most likely you're going to go to college.

173
00:10:34,389 --> 00:10:37,130
[SPEAKER_05]: So they do half-day schedules, and those students can take AP.

174
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:40,171
[SPEAKER_05]: They can do anything they want, because it's a little bit of a different set up now.

175
00:10:40,611 --> 00:10:42,332
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the traditional side,

176
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:48,696
[SPEAKER_05]: The AB week schedule, they pretty much take all the core courses, and there's really no room for anything else.

177
00:10:48,977 --> 00:10:49,257
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

178
00:10:50,518 --> 00:10:52,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, Rich, you know, you mentioned college.

179
00:10:53,940 --> 00:11:04,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Very curious, if you attend the Volk, student goes to the Volk, you know, graduates and everything, can that student, will he have what's needed to go into a college?

180
00:11:04,388 --> 00:11:05,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you have all the credits you need.

181
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:12,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I have had students in the past have gone to some of the community colleges, some have gone to the state colleges in my own program.

182
00:11:13,392 --> 00:11:26,256
[SPEAKER_05]: But programs like health assisting routinely send students off to college because they might be going to a nursing program or when they graduate actually, nursing students leave here with a CNA, a certified nursing assistant.

183
00:11:27,216 --> 00:11:29,837
[SPEAKER_05]: People that are in robotics and engineering, they'll go off.

184
00:11:29,857 --> 00:11:33,978
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we're an award-winning robotics and engineering program.

185
00:11:34,218 --> 00:11:34,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

186
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:35,439
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually won, they came in.

187
00:11:36,313 --> 00:11:39,494
[SPEAKER_05]: third or ninth in the world in a competition.

188
00:11:39,814 --> 00:11:40,634
[SPEAKER_05]: But they go to college.

189
00:11:41,594 --> 00:11:47,616
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things, if you go to a state school, they waive any language requirements if you go to a vocational school.

190
00:11:47,976 --> 00:11:50,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they realize that basically we have our own language.

191
00:11:51,197 --> 00:11:53,417
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the language we learn is the language of our traits.

192
00:11:54,117 --> 00:11:56,238
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's waived in a lot of cases.

193
00:11:56,618 --> 00:11:59,539
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, no, I wouldn't say that you're going to end up in Harvard or Yale.

194
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:03,864
[SPEAKER_05]: But you might end up at Merrimack or Northeastern, you know, some really good colleges.

195
00:12:04,464 --> 00:12:06,046
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, absolutely.

196
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:09,991
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of the myths people say, I don't want to go to the vote because I want to go to college.

197
00:12:10,051 --> 00:12:11,293
[SPEAKER_05]: That's absolutely false.

198
00:12:11,553 --> 00:12:12,855
[SPEAKER_05]: You can absolutely go to college.

199
00:12:13,576 --> 00:12:14,417
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great question.

200
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:15,759
[SPEAKER_04]: Great answer.

201
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:17,200
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a good thing to know.

202
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:18,302
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of kids would.

203
00:12:19,423 --> 00:12:20,303
[SPEAKER_04]: would like to know that.

204
00:12:20,383 --> 00:12:26,025
[SPEAKER_05]: And parents, a lot of times it's the parents that take the kids out of the vote, because, I don't know, I want my kid to go to college, okay, but you know.

205
00:12:26,045 --> 00:12:27,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, I hear you.

206
00:12:27,865 --> 00:12:31,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so, Rich, thanks for that answer.

207
00:12:31,126 --> 00:12:46,709
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a promotional video that we were able to get from the vocational program, and I think I'd like to take a pause now, and let's just show the audience this promo video.

208
00:12:46,729 --> 00:12:49,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's well done, so let's take a look.

209
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:49,278
[SPEAKER_04]: you

210
00:13:09,916 --> 00:13:14,498
[SPEAKER_01]: The value of a career technical education is that it's really an added benefit to your high school diploma.

211
00:13:15,058 --> 00:13:19,680
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always great to have a skill to fall back on should you choose not to pursue this after high school.

212
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,581
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that you'll always have.

213
00:13:21,901 --> 00:13:26,323
[SPEAKER_01]: We're working with students to help them become more educated individuals when they leave this school.

214
00:13:26,783 --> 00:13:28,884
[SPEAKER_01]: If they pursue it as a career, then that's a bonus.

215
00:13:29,450 --> 00:13:36,912
[SPEAKER_05]: So vocational education gets a student prepared to enter the workforce with more knowledge than somebody who would just come off the street.

216
00:13:37,032 --> 00:13:44,735
[SPEAKER_05]: So in our trade, in the electrical trade, it's a licensed trade, and we need to work so many hours and go through so many hours of schooling.

217
00:13:45,175 --> 00:13:50,356
[SPEAKER_05]: In the vocational school, they earn about a year's worth of that hands-on training and schooling.

218
00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:55,378
[SPEAKER_05]: And three years after graduation, they're eligible to take their test, their electrical license.

219
00:13:55,899 --> 00:14:02,740
[SPEAKER_00]: I chose the Vogue because I knew in eighth grade that when I came to the high school that I wanted to join the Vogue.

220
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,041
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to do something with my hands.

221
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:07,221
[SPEAKER_00]: My older brother, he chose the Vogue.

222
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:11,902
[SPEAKER_00]: So I kind of got to tour with him and see all the different shops.

223
00:14:11,942 --> 00:14:12,862
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was super excited.

224
00:14:13,282 --> 00:14:16,963
[SPEAKER_03]: Learning how to be in the field isn't just about knowing your technical knowledge.

225
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:19,543
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about learning how to work with people.

226
00:14:19,643 --> 00:14:22,044
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of soft skills that we also teach.

227
00:14:22,784 --> 00:14:27,429
[SPEAKER_03]: that you wouldn't necessarily get in a lot of your academic settings.

228
00:14:27,489 --> 00:14:31,914
[SPEAKER_03]: So we teach people how to be successful, both with skills but also working with people.

229
00:14:32,314 --> 00:14:34,757
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe that vocational education is priceless.

230
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:44,027
[SPEAKER_06]: You're gaining real-life quality experiences in a school setting to be ready to go into the working world or to continue on with your education.

231
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:49,856
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford is unique in that we offer a blend of academic programs and career technical programs.

232
00:14:50,217 --> 00:14:56,264
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that's really nice about Medford High School, as opposed to other vocational schools in the state, is that you don't have to apply.

233
00:14:56,584 --> 00:15:02,792
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a resident in the city of Medford and you come to Medford High School, you have every opportunity to take a career tech program.

234
00:15:03,032 --> 00:15:11,938
[SPEAKER_02]: So the main value, I believe, is that you're getting a career in technical education while you're in high school and getting the academic portion of it.

235
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:16,461
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only are you getting paid for college, you're also getting education that you would have had to pay for.

236
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:21,885
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the most interesting projects we've participated in this week is our Candyland project.

237
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:24,707
[SPEAKER_09]: It's our next display project.

238
00:15:25,688 --> 00:15:28,670
[SPEAKER_09]: And I am working on a cotton candy hairstyle.

239
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,991
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're learning about electronics.

240
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,692
[SPEAKER_07]: We're doing CAD.

241
00:15:34,832 --> 00:15:37,954
[SPEAKER_07]: We can also learn about the machine shop, that kind of stuff.

242
00:15:38,054 --> 00:15:47,879
[SPEAKER_08]: The thing I like most about my shop is being able to work with each other more like a family and being able to lead the school and learning how to work together as a team.

243
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,401
[SPEAKER_08]: And we actually do get along really well as a team.

244
00:15:50,581 --> 00:15:52,502
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's definitely my favorite part of my shop.

245
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:56,392
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so excited to be part of the next few years at Medford High School.

246
00:15:56,753 --> 00:16:00,256
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't heard, we are in the pipeline for a brand new building.

247
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:05,401
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to offer an expanded learning opportunity, not only for our high school students, but for also the community.

248
00:16:05,621 --> 00:16:07,303
[SPEAKER_01]: What new programs do we want to offer?

249
00:16:07,563 --> 00:16:13,589
[SPEAKER_01]: What opportunities do we want to provide for residents after the school day in programs such as manufacturing and construction?

250
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:17,790
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the things we value here at MVTHS is we care about each other.

251
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:18,870
[SPEAKER_01]: We respect each other.

252
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,870
[SPEAKER_01]: We support diversity.

253
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:22,270
[SPEAKER_01]: We embrace diversity.

254
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:29,732
[SPEAKER_01]: We encourage students to expand their thinking, to experience new things, and make informed decisions about where they plan to go after high school.

255
00:16:29,852 --> 00:16:39,293
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a faculty that has chosen to leave their industry, their trade area, to come and teach, and that says a lot about the people we have here under this roof.

256
00:16:39,493 --> 00:16:42,974
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a truly authentic learning experience that these teachers provide.

257
00:16:43,475 --> 00:16:46,691
[SPEAKER_01]: will tell you firsthand, MVTHS is a great place to be.

258
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:55,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you know Rich, we saw some sheds on that.

259
00:16:55,992 --> 00:16:56,932
[SPEAKER_04]: I had no idea.

260
00:16:56,952 --> 00:16:59,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, so the thing about the VOC, we're very collaborative.

261
00:16:59,774 --> 00:17:08,299
[SPEAKER_05]: The carpentry program and the construction labors program, they work together to furnish sheds.

262
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:15,283
[SPEAKER_05]: People first started out with, there was some that were needed in the city, and they built a huge shed up at the top of the Field of Dreams.

263
00:17:16,003 --> 00:17:18,686
[SPEAKER_05]: And they work together on that construction laborers.

264
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:20,688
[SPEAKER_05]: They put the foundation in.

265
00:17:21,168 --> 00:17:27,394
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the very talented teachers over in the carpentry department, they prefab the shed in the shop.

266
00:17:28,155 --> 00:17:32,460
[SPEAKER_05]: And then they take it apart, and they bring it to wherever the site's going to be.

267
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,002
[SPEAKER_05]: They've done some for some of the schools.

268
00:17:35,643 --> 00:17:37,084
[SPEAKER_05]: They've done some for some private citizens.

269
00:17:37,685 --> 00:17:39,527
[SPEAKER_05]: People can reach out to Chad Fallon.

270
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:41,328
[SPEAKER_05]: and request a shed.

271
00:17:41,868 --> 00:17:49,892
[SPEAKER_05]: And if the time is there and if it fits the curriculum for that period of time, they will build a shed and deliver it and assemble it right in your backyard for you.

272
00:17:50,632 --> 00:17:53,134
[SPEAKER_05]: But you got to call Chad and make sure that there's time.

273
00:17:53,514 --> 00:17:55,054
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only so much time in a year.

274
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,735
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have students doing it.

275
00:17:56,955 --> 00:18:01,578
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's not like when you call for a prefabricated shed from Home Depot.

276
00:18:01,598 --> 00:18:05,400
[SPEAKER_05]: You're getting professional work done, nothing but the best quality lumber.

277
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,081
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're under the direct supervision of some really talented teachers.

278
00:18:10,121 --> 00:18:10,401
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

279
00:18:10,501 --> 00:18:17,984
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean I was just like that's a great program I never knew it existed and I'm sure a lot of people in Medford don't know it existed.

280
00:18:18,044 --> 00:18:25,006
[SPEAKER_04]: So something to look into really great So I'm sure I never knew that existed.

281
00:18:25,306 --> 00:18:25,726
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?

282
00:18:26,006 --> 00:18:27,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, is there other programs?

283
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:32,044
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there must be a lot, so can you give us an idea?

284
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:33,986
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got some of the traditional programs.

285
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:41,514
[SPEAKER_05]: We have auto technology and we have carpentry, metal fabrication, electrical of course.

286
00:18:42,414 --> 00:18:45,357
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't call it printing anymore, they call it graphic design.

287
00:18:46,678 --> 00:18:58,110
[SPEAKER_05]: We also have now we have biotech which is a great program They're actually creating a diesel fuel up there from the they go down to the I tell you we collaborate They go down to the culinary program.

288
00:18:58,471 --> 00:19:02,475
[SPEAKER_05]: They take the oil that they use there and they make biodiesel fuel out of that and

289
00:19:04,096 --> 00:19:09,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Construction and Craft Laborers, originally was sponsored by Local 22, and now they're kind of flying on their own.

290
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,242
[SPEAKER_05]: They are very closely tied to that local laborers union.

291
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:16,284
[SPEAKER_05]: They take a lot of trips up to Hopkinton to their training facilities.

292
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:17,865
[SPEAKER_05]: We have cosmetology.

293
00:19:18,325 --> 00:19:24,670
[SPEAKER_05]: A student can come in, and they actually leave here with a license, a cosmetology license, a licensed hairdresser.

294
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,352
[SPEAKER_05]: And now they can get out there and start working.

295
00:19:28,252 --> 00:19:28,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Immediately.

296
00:19:29,153 --> 00:19:30,534
[SPEAKER_05]: They're leaving there with the license.

297
00:19:30,554 --> 00:19:30,534
100%.

298
00:19:30,574 --> 00:19:30,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Go to work.

299
00:19:32,595 --> 00:19:37,798
[SPEAKER_05]: In culinary, they get safe serve certified before they even get really rolling there.

300
00:19:38,438 --> 00:19:44,281
[SPEAKER_05]: The restaurant is open from Tuesday through Friday from about 8 in the morning until 2 in the afternoon.

301
00:19:44,302 --> 00:19:45,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, that's great to know.

302
00:19:45,302 --> 00:19:46,563
[SPEAKER_04]: They do have a restaurant.

303
00:19:46,623 --> 00:19:47,923
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a functioning restaurant.

304
00:19:47,944 --> 00:19:48,764
[SPEAKER_04]: People come for lunch.

305
00:19:48,784 --> 00:19:49,704
[SPEAKER_04]: People come for lunch all the time.

306
00:19:49,724 --> 00:19:51,986
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's another thing, MedFed, you need to know about.

307
00:19:52,606 --> 00:19:54,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, and the lunches are unbelievable.

308
00:19:54,646 --> 00:19:55,627
[SPEAKER_05]: They put out a menu.

309
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:56,387
[SPEAKER_05]: They have a website.

310
00:19:56,447 --> 00:19:57,467
[SPEAKER_05]: You can go on there.

311
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,467
[SPEAKER_05]: That's wonderful to know.

312
00:19:58,967 --> 00:20:00,208
[SPEAKER_05]: I mentioned Engineering Robotics.

313
00:20:00,248 --> 00:20:07,589
[SPEAKER_05]: Film and TV, where we're sitting right now, pretty unique that we share the film and TV studio with Medford Media.

314
00:20:08,129 --> 00:20:10,190
[SPEAKER_05]: And so one place does it all.

315
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:14,571
[SPEAKER_05]: And the students get to see what the Medford Media people are doing and vice versa.

316
00:20:16,071 --> 00:20:17,171
[SPEAKER_05]: We get, what else?

317
00:20:17,211 --> 00:20:18,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, graphic design, I mentioned.

318
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:21,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Health assisting is the nursing program that we have.

319
00:20:22,072 --> 00:20:24,175
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have programming and web development.

320
00:20:24,755 --> 00:20:26,117
[SPEAKER_05]: And you probably read about them.

321
00:20:26,277 --> 00:20:32,985
[SPEAKER_05]: They were the kids that hacked the T. And they actually showed the T how they did it so that they could get into the Charlie Cards.

322
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:38,411
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe they were asked to speak at a symposium in Las Vegas and explain what they did.

323
00:20:38,852 --> 00:20:41,195
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we have a lot of good things going on here.

324
00:20:41,515 --> 00:20:41,935
[SPEAKER_05]: And of course,

325
00:20:42,827 --> 00:20:45,488
[SPEAKER_05]: When I mention collaboration, we all work throughout the school.

326
00:20:45,608 --> 00:20:49,550
[SPEAKER_05]: So the culinary arts program, that's a beautiful restaurant.

327
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,711
[SPEAKER_05]: But that was built by the students and the teachers.

328
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:57,813
[SPEAKER_05]: Carpentry, construction, metal fab, we all got together and we ripped out the old print shop, made it a restaurant.

329
00:20:58,233 --> 00:21:00,874
[SPEAKER_05]: Where we are, not here, but in robotics and engineering, same thing.

330
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,615
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of us work together.

331
00:21:02,675 --> 00:21:05,936
[SPEAKER_05]: The kids get real hands-on working experience right in school.

332
00:21:06,437 --> 00:21:07,317
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have a blast doing it.

333
00:21:08,217 --> 00:21:09,118
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sounds like,

334
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it doesn't sound like there was a lot of great things.

335
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:17,462
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, really great things going on at the vocational technical school.

336
00:21:17,522 --> 00:21:23,344
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, Medford, let's support them and do everything we can.

337
00:21:23,404 --> 00:21:27,126
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is, it's all news to me, put it that way.

338
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,827
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all a lot of new programs.

339
00:21:28,847 --> 00:21:29,367
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a hidden gem.

340
00:21:29,667 --> 00:21:31,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, you really are a hidden gem.

341
00:21:31,568 --> 00:21:32,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.

342
00:21:32,068 --> 00:21:33,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's the perfect way of putting it.

343
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:36,290
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I got to add something.

344
00:21:38,561 --> 00:21:52,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to add something because there was a program, I'm not sure if it's still ongoing, my sister-in-law, Barbara, God rest her soul, you know, passed away from leukemia.

345
00:21:52,784 --> 00:21:55,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you helped her out, you know.

346
00:21:57,826 --> 00:22:07,868
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was very, very difficult at my brother's house to, you know, there came a time when she couldn't get in and out of the house.

347
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:11,957
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very, very difficult, you know.

348
00:22:13,678 --> 00:22:15,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Transportation, everything.

349
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:25,826
[SPEAKER_04]: And we found out through you, and I believe I have to throw in Rick Caviello, because I think Rick has done some tremendous things.

350
00:22:25,866 --> 00:22:26,406
[SPEAKER_04]: But he has.

351
00:22:26,446 --> 00:22:27,607
[SPEAKER_04]: He's a great guy.

352
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:32,670
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, my brother went, bought the material.

353
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:35,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Tremendous job they did.

354
00:22:36,013 --> 00:22:36,553
[SPEAKER_04]: They came.

355
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:48,021
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you always think about the little things people do and when someone's less fortunate, you know, struggling with their health issue, whatever.

356
00:22:48,321 --> 00:22:52,983
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was amazing, the crew that showed up at his house.

357
00:22:54,043 --> 00:23:06,976
[SPEAKER_04]: The job that they did, okay, and the relief that it gave to my brother and his wife, that she was able, you know, they built this, I'm telling you, it was a beautiful ramp.

358
00:23:07,156 --> 00:23:18,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Still there, and you know, unfortunately, you know, as you know, Barbara passed away, but that's a program, you know, wasn't for Riccardo Viallo, guys like yourself.

359
00:23:19,295 --> 00:23:20,356
[SPEAKER_04]: My brother would have never known.

360
00:23:20,657 --> 00:23:22,920
[SPEAKER_04]: And I tell you, it saved him.

361
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:34,734
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't tell you what it did for him during that period of time to be able to, even for Baba, just to come down the ramp and be able to go outside for a little while.

362
00:23:35,095 --> 00:23:37,398
[SPEAKER_04]: When we do stuff like that, the people do pay for the parts.

363
00:23:37,698 --> 00:23:57,623
[SPEAKER_05]: yes it's not it's not you just get free labor basically yeah which is a big part of it that's huge in barbara's case uh they did build that ramp uh construction and carpentry i believe metal fab was involved with the railings and all yes and uh yeah they they were able to reach out and you know we'll help people in need like that whenever they really need it just got to contact us and yeah i think one time a person

364
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:09,590
[SPEAKER_05]: was trying to, a person was coming down with early onset Alzheimer's or dementia and was trying to get around and they had purchased a school bus so they could travel.

365
00:24:10,331 --> 00:24:15,474
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that some of the programs here helped get that thing up and running.

366
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:22,658
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we try to help out where we can, but we're limited by the amount of time there is in a school day and things such as that.

367
00:24:22,718 --> 00:24:26,981
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, I'm gonna get short if I don't mention that we have early childhood education.

368
00:24:27,761 --> 00:24:30,024
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had to get that in because I you know

369
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:46,362
[SPEAKER_04]: You put it perfectly, it is a gem up there.

370
00:24:46,522 --> 00:24:53,167
[SPEAKER_04]: The things that they do, and the job that they did for my brother was, it was just tremendous.

371
00:24:53,227 --> 00:25:00,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Incredible workmanship, I mean, you know, and the relief that he got from it, just wonderful.

372
00:25:01,273 --> 00:25:05,136
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm very glad that we got the time to have you come up.

373
00:25:06,136 --> 00:25:10,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Extremely happy we got to do this show, so people get an idea of

374
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,881
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's a lot of great things, you know, happening in Medford.

375
00:25:16,121 --> 00:25:17,442
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're doing this show.

376
00:25:18,022 --> 00:25:21,163
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you know, we're trying to get information out to people.

00:25:21,903 --> 00:25:23,123
[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to get knowledge.

378

[SPEAKER_04]: We're trying to be informative, get some facts out.

379
00:25:27,104 --> 00:25:28,865
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I just look at

380
00:25:29,914 --> 00:25:36,583
[SPEAKER_04]: at the vocational technical school is one of those programs that needs to be looked at.

381
00:25:36,603 --> 00:25:44,633
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and you guys have, you know, I applaud you, and the whole city should be applauding you, because you do, you do a tremendous job.

382
00:25:45,074 --> 00:25:46,616
[SPEAKER_04]: All the programs, the kids.
