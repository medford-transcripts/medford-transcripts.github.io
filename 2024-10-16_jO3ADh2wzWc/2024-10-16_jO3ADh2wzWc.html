    <p>[John Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=25.9s">Hello,</a>  everyone, and welcome to your show, Medford Happenings, a show for and about the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=35.785s">Today,</a>  we got a very, very special guest with us, Mr. Rich Cormier, who was a teacher at the electrical department at the Medford Vocational Technical High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=49.193s">Rick,</a>  thank you for coming to the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=51.774s">My</a>  pleasure. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=52.255s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=52.755s">It's</a>  great to have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=55.367s">A</a>  lot of great things happen at the vocational school and Rich is here to give us some good examples of exactly what's going on at this great school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=66.501s">So</a>  Rich, first question I'd have to ask you is how did you get into this? <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=72.377s">The</a>  teaching end, and how long have you been doing it?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=75.019s">Actually</a>  kind of by accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=77.261s">I</a>  had always thought about teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=78.642s">I</a>  graduated from here in 1975. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=80.764s">I</a>  went on and had a career for about 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=84.327s">And</a>  one of my apprentices, I bumped into them one night, Tony Puccio, friend of the show, mentioned that he had been teaching evening school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=91.873s">and</a>  told me I should give them a call, because they were always looking for teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=95.035s">It</a>  was something I wanted to try. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=96.536s">So</a>  I gave them a call, and they were dumb enough to hire me. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=100.379s">And</a>  the night school was here at the high school, and it turns out one of the electrical teachers was retiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=106.443s">And</a>  so Tom Ritchie, who was the lead teacher at the time, came and found me one night and asked me if I was interested in getting into this full time. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=114.829s">And</a>  it took a lot of thinking because you take a massive pay cut when you do something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=119.35s">Teaching</a>  doesn't pay what being an electrician pays. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=122.25s">So</a>  my wife and I decided it would be a good move. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=124.451s">Time</a>  for me to leave the trade and do something different with my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=128.011s">And</a>  so at the age of 50, I figured out what I wanted to be when I grew up. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=131.892s">And</a>  so I've been doing that now since 2007. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=133.452s">So</a>  I've been doing, this is my 18th year of teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=137.933s">Something</a>  I love, I'm very passionate about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=140.093s">I</a>  still do the nighttime teaching also. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=142.494s">And</a>  it's just something I really enjoy.</p>
