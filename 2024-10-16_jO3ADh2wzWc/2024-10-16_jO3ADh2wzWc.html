    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=25.9s">Hello,</a>  everyone, and welcome to your show, Medford Happenings, a show for and about the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=35.785s">Today,</a>  we got a very, very special guest with us, Mr. Rich Cormier, who was a teacher at the electrical department at the Medford Vocational Technical High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=49.193s">Rick,</a>  thank you for coming to the show. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=51.774s">My</a>  pleasure. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=52.255s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=52.755s">It's</a>  great to have you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=55.367s">A</a>  lot of great things happen at the vocational school and Rich is here to give us some good examples of exactly what's going on at this great school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=66.501s">So</a>  Rich, first question I'd have to ask you is how did you get into this? <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=72.377s">The</a>  teaching end, and how long have you been doing it?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=75.019s">Actually</a>  kind of by accident. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=77.261s">I</a>  had always thought about teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=78.642s">I</a>  graduated from here in 1975. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=80.764s">I</a>  went on and had a career for about 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=84.327s">And</a>  one of my apprentices, I bumped into them one night, Tony Puccio, friend of the show, mentioned that he had been teaching evening school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=91.873s">and</a>  told me I should give them a call, because they were always looking for teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=95.035s">It</a>  was something I wanted to try. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=96.536s">So</a>  I gave them a call, and they were dumb enough to hire me. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=100.379s">And</a>  the night school was here at the high school, and it turns out one of the electrical teachers was retiring. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=106.443s">And</a>  so Tom Ritchie, who was the lead teacher at the time, came and found me one night and asked me if I was interested in getting into this full time. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=114.829s">And</a>  it took a lot of thinking because you take a massive pay cut when you do something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=119.35s">Teaching</a>  doesn't pay what being an electrician pays. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=122.25s">So</a>  my wife and I decided it would be a good move. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=124.451s">Time</a>  for me to leave the trade and do something different with my life. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=128.011s">And</a>  so at the age of 50, I figured out what I wanted to be when I grew up. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=131.892s">And</a>  so I've been doing that now since 2007. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=133.452s">So</a>  I've been doing, this is my 18th year of teaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=137.933s">Something</a>  I love, I'm very passionate about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=140.093s">I</a>  still do the nighttime teaching also. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=142.494s">And</a>  it's just something I really enjoy.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=144.572s">That's</a>  great, great to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=146.115s">I'm</a>  happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=147.398s">I</a>  mean, it's nice to be able to make a career change like that and enjoy what you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=153.73s">I</a>  guess my next question based on your answer is, <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=157.608s">18</a>  years, what's changed over the last 18 years at the vocational school?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=161.272s">You</a>  know, when I first started teaching, I would ask the freshmen to raise their hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=165.977s">How</a>  many of you got poked fun of because you were chosen to vocational school? <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=169.921s">And</a>  they'd all raise their hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=171.223s">And</a>  everybody was given a hard time, just like I was when I was a kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=174.506s">You</a>  must be an idiot, you're going to the voc, you can't go to college, dummy. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=178.31s">And</a>  as it turns out, what I learned early on was that all those people that laughed at me for going to the Volk, I ended up working in their houses and charging pretty good money for doing things for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=187.713s">So</a>  that worked out pretty well. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=189.473s">And</a>  I explained that to the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=190.994s">I</a>  said, you know, this is going to change your life. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=192.494s">This</a>  is change your life money that you can make as an electrician. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=195.335s">It's</a>  a good paying job. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=196.675s">So</a>  we started out as almost like second class citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=199.996s">And</a>  now the vocational school, my first class, I had six sophomores in my first class when I came here. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=205.638s">Now</a>  I have 22 with a waiting list of four, and that's routine, and that's the entire school's that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=211.801s">The</a>  entire school has grown from graduating 60 or 80 students a year to well over 200 students a year graduate from the VOC. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=220.306s">And</a>  they're leaving and they're staying in the trade. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=223.467s">I'd</a>  say a good 35% of the students stay within the trade that they graduate from, which is pretty good numbers, because I don't think colleges has that number.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=232.672s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=233.133s">I</a>  mean, that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=234.215s">It's</a>  great to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=235.999s">It's</a>  great to know that, you know, the job that's getting done here. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=240.59s">You</a>  know, if a student wanted to get in here, right, what's the process? <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=245.694s">What's</a>  the test required? <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=247.935s">I</a>  mean, what do they need? <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=248.716s">Do</a>  they need a license? <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=249.877s">How</a>  do they do it?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=250.677s">Well,</a>  we are one of the very few in the state where we're a city-owned vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=256.702s">Many</a>  of the vocational schools are regional. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=258.943s">And</a>  that means they have numerous cities that pay into them. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=261.645s">And</a>  the students come from all over. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=263.287s">In</a>  Medford, we have just our own students. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=265.408s">We</a>  have, in the past, taken students from out of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=268.15s">However,</a>  we have such a demand now in our own city, we don't have room for people from outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=273.735s">We</a>  used to send students to Minuteman. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=275.236s">They</a>  would go to Minuteman because the rule is if you don't have a program and another school does, your city has to pay for a student to go to that school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=283.984s">Well,</a>  now we have as many programs as Minuteman. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=286.526s">And</a>  students are choosing to stay here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=288.247s">So</a>  as a freshman, they come in and they choose. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=291.17s">Do</a>  they want to take vocational rotations, an exploratory course, we call it? <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=296.154s">And</a>  now a freshman comes in, and they sample all 15 programs that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=301.641s">They</a>  do a four-day rotation, and at the end of the second quarter, they choose which one they want to stay in. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=309.511s">Some</a>  of them will choose to go to the high school, and some will choose to stay in the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=314.137s">And</a>  that's when we start building them. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=315.618s">From</a>  that point on, from the third quarter on, for half a year, they're in a program and they get all the beginning stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=321.562s">They</a>  get all the safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=322.842s">They</a>  get all the basics. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=324.543s">We</a>  talked to them about a lot of theory that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=326.865s">And</a>  they get to use the tools. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=328.766s">And</a>  so for one period a day, you know, the high school has a six-day schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=334.049s">The</a>  Vokes have a five-day schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=335.77s">That's</a>  a whole other problem for another day. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=339.096s">But</a>  anyway, they come in and they learn how to use the tools, and they learn basic circuits, and then by the time sophomore year starts, they're ready to get going. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=346.724s">So</a>  a student will spend the four days in a rotation, try them all out. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=350.928s">I</a>  ask them all the same question, what do you think you'll be next year? <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=353.37s">A</a>  lot of them don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=354.952s">And</a>  we tell them, well, you've got 15 choices to make, plus the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=358.816s">So</a>  they actually, come February, they have 16 choices that they can look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=363.14s">and</a>  they make their decisions and we keep a lot of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=366.265s">We</a>  lose a few, like I think I started with 24. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=369.11s">A</a>  couple of them decided to go to the high school, but then I grabbed another couple, they came in, so it worked out pretty well. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=374.438s">And</a>  every one of the shops in here does the same thing.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=377.352s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=378.052s">So</a>  I'm on a waiting list. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=380.333s">What</a>  does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=381.353s">Exactly</a>  what does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=382.713s">So</a>  we grade the students. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=384.454s">Each</a>  teacher grades the student on their four days. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=387.355s">It's</a>  not a very strict thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=388.335s">It's</a>  basically, did they show up? <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=390.375s">Did</a>  they show up on time? <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=392.056s">And</a>  were they interested in the trade? <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=395.137s">It's</a>  a scale of 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=396.437s">You</a>  get three points a day for the four days. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=400.698s">And</a>  we look at that and we say, all right, now the student did really well in that class, gets decent grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=407.461s">You</a>  don't have to get all A's. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=408.982s">B's</a>  and C's are fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=411.403s">But</a>  you can't be a knucklehead. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=413.044s">You</a>  can't be a person who gets a lot of cut classes, not just us. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=418.246s">Throughout</a>  the high school career, the whole freshman year, we look at their attendance, we look at their overall attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=424.249s">Are</a>  they a person who's never been to school? <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=425.549s">Because</a>  think about this, we're training them for a career. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=429.431s">not</a>  to be going to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=431.392s">And</a>  when you're on a career, you've got to be on time for your job, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=434.434s">And</a>  so we try to push that on them, explain to them that being on time starts right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=439.198s">You</a>  know, you made this choice to be in the vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=441.419s">You</a>  have to do things our way, which means you've got to be on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=444.021s">And</a>  that doesn't mean just for my class. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=445.822s">That</a>  means in the morning, you've got to be on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=448.144s">And</a>  you know, you talk to the kids, especially when I have my own, and I'll say to them, you know, why are you late? <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=454.288s">And</a>  when the answer starts out, well, my mother, well, my sister, no, no, that's not a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=458.631s">There's</a>  a bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=459.712s">If</a>  your mother can't get you to school on time, your sister can't get you, take the bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=463.854s">So</a>  we look at the attendance. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=466.056s">We</a>  look at their grades. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=467.337s">And</a>  so the people that didn't make it, it doesn't mean they're bad people. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=471.219s">It</a>  just means that maybe somewhere along the line, they didn't do everything the right way. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=475.932s">So</a>  they may end up in high school, or they may end up in a trade or in a program that isn't quite populated yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=482.477s">So</a>  we still, even though we're very popular, there are some areas where they could use more students. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=489.042s">And</a>  so maybe the student will filter down to that one, and if they don't like that, then they go to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=493.025s">So</a>  there's, not like we're gonna throw them on the street, they have something to do, it may not be their first choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=497.228s">All</a>  right, so it's just not their first choice, that's all. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=499.79s">And</a>  we tell them that right up front, we explain what they need to do.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=503.211s">All</a>  right, so years ago, not that many years ago, but a few years ago, I was in the co-op program. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=510.733s">That</a>  was a long time ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=512.414s">No,</a>  it wasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=513.014s">It</a>  just seemed like yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=515.114s">But</a>  anyhow, does the co-op program still exist? <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=518.675s">Oh,</a>  absolutely.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=520.596s">So</a>  this year my group is down to I think 13 seniors and already we have six out on co-op. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=528.368s">Different</a>  companies, local companies too, Pucho Electric has taken a couple of my guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=533.997s">Companies</a>  are <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=535.639s">There's</a>  a company called Facilico, Brian Regan, a graduate of the program, Steve Nardone, who's a graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=541.083s">He</a>  has a couple of our kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=542.624s">And</a>  I actually have a couple of students working in the local union. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=545.786s">They</a>  hire them, they call them wire men or something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=549.628s">And</a>  they're working for a union company, which we have a decent partnership with the union. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=555.892s">They</a>  usually give us a scholarship opportunity for two of our students, where as long as they take the exam, <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=562.276s">They'll</a>  take two of our students right in. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=563.677s">They</a>  don't have to do the interview process or any of that stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=566.839s">And</a>  they'll do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=567.419s">They</a>  do that with a lot of vocational schools around. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=569.16s">The</a>  leadership in the 103 realized one day that they were taking in all these new people, these new apprentices who knew nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=578.005s">And</a>  they had these vocational schools with kids that were trained. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=581.027s">At</a>  least they knew the tools, the parts. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=583.308s">So</a>  they've been taking advantage of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=585.469s">And</a>  we've had a good partnership with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=587.19s">But</a>  they also go into work for companies that are non-union. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=590.492s">I</a>  have to find a balance to tell the students, hey, there's pros and cons on both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=595.934s">I</a>  never worked in the union, I did okay for 30 years and so did some of the other teachers. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=600.676s">So</a>  they have to see both sides of the coin. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=602.477s">So</a>  on co-op, they go to work for a week, they make anywhere between $600 and $800 and then the following week they come back to school, they do all their academics. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=610.981s">They</a>  do all the academics as the high school, they do it in half the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=614.682s">So</a>  they double up their classes on their academic week. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=617.823s">They</a>  can't do a lot of electives. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=619.224s">They</a>  can't really do a language unless they want to do it online. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=622.525s">They</a>  can't take AP courses on the AB week. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=625.466s">Some</a>  of our programs do half-day schedules. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=628.407s">For</a>  instance, if you're going to go into college, a program like robotics and engineering, most likely you're going to go to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=634.389s">So</a>  they do half-day schedules, and those students can take AP. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=637.15s">They</a>  can do anything they want, because it's a little bit of a different set up now. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=640.611s">But</a>  on the traditional side, <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=642.772s">The</a>  AB week schedule, they pretty much take all the core courses, and there's really no room for anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=648.977s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=650.518s">Hey,</a>  Rich, you know, you mentioned college. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=653.94s">Very</a>  curious, if you attend the Volk, student goes to the Volk, you know, graduates and everything, can that student, will he have what's needed to go into a college?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=664.388s">Yeah,</a>  you have all the credits you need. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=667.43s">I</a>  have had students in the past have gone to some of the community colleges, some have gone to the state colleges in my own program. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=673.392s">But</a>  programs like health assisting routinely send students off to college because they might be going to a nursing program or when they graduate actually, nursing students leave here with a CNA, a certified nursing assistant. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=687.216s">People</a>  that are in robotics and engineering, they'll go off. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=689.857s">You</a>  know, we're an award-winning robotics and engineering program. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=694.218s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=694.519s">Actually</a>  won, they came in. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=696.313s">third</a>  or ninth in the world in a competition. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=699.814s">But</a>  they go to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=701.594s">One</a>  of the things, if you go to a state school, they waive any language requirements if you go to a vocational school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=707.976s">Because</a>  they realize that basically we have our own language. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=711.197s">And</a>  so the language we learn is the language of our traits. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=714.117s">So</a>  that's waived in a lot of cases. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=716.618s">But</a>  yeah, no, I wouldn't say that you're going to end up in Harvard or Yale. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=720.339s">But</a>  you might end up at Merrimack or Northeastern, you know, some really good colleges. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=724.464s">And</a>  yeah, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=726.247s">That's</a>  one of the myths people say, I don't want to go to the vote because I want to go to college. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=730.051s">That's</a>  absolutely false. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=731.553s">You</a>  can absolutely go to college.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=733.576s">That's</a>  a great question. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=734.958s">Great</a>  answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=735.859s">And</a>  that's a good thing to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=737.261s">I</a>  think a lot of kids would. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=739.423s">would</a>  like to know that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=740.383s">And</a>  parents, a lot of times it's the parents that take the kids out of the vote, because, I don't know, I want my kid to go to college, okay, but you know.</p>

    <p>[Petrella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=746.045s">Yeah,</a>  yeah, I hear you. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=747.865s">Okay,</a>  so, Rich, thanks for that answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=751.126s">We</a>  have a promotional video that we were able to get from the vocational program, and I think I'd like to take a pause now, and let's just show the audience this promo video. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=766.729s">I</a>  think it's well done, so let's take a look. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=769.21s">you</a> </p>

    <p>[Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=789.916s">The</a>  value of a career technical education is that it's really an added benefit to your high school diploma. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=795.058s">It's</a>  always great to have a skill to fall back on should you choose not to pursue this after high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=800.08s">It's</a>  something that you'll always have. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=801.901s">We're</a>  working with students to help them become more educated individuals when they leave this school. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=806.783s">If</a>  they pursue it as a career, then that's a bonus.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=809.45s">So</a>  vocational education gets a student prepared to enter the workforce with more knowledge than somebody who would just come off the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=817.032s">So</a>  in our trade, in the electrical trade, it's a licensed trade, and we need to work so many hours and go through so many hours of schooling. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=825.175s">In</a>  the vocational school, they earn about a year's worth of that hands-on training and schooling. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=830.817s">And</a>  three years after graduation, they're eligible to take their test, their electrical license.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=835.899s">I</a>  chose the Vogue because I knew in eighth grade that when I came to the high school that I wanted to join the Vogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=842.78s">I</a>  wanted to do something with my hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=844.401s">My</a>  older brother, he chose the Vogue. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=848.181s">So</a>  I kind of got to tour with him and see all the different shops. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=851.942s">And</a>  I was super excited.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=853.282s">Learning</a>  how to be in the field isn't just about knowing your technical knowledge. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=856.983s">It's</a>  about learning how to work with people. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=859.643s">There's</a>  a lot of soft skills that we also teach. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=862.784s">that</a>  you wouldn't necessarily get in a lot of your academic settings. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=867.489s">So</a>  we teach people how to be successful, both with skills but also working with people.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_06]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=872.314s">I</a>  believe that vocational education is priceless. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=875.057s">You're</a>  gaining real-life quality experiences in a school setting to be ready to go into the working world or to continue on with your education.</p>

    <p>[Fallon]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=884.57s">Medford</a>  is unique in that we offer a blend of academic programs and career technical programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=890.217s">One</a>  thing that's really nice about Medford High School, as opposed to other vocational schools in the state, is that you don't have to apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=896.584s">If</a>  you're a resident in the city of Medford and you come to Medford High School, you have every opportunity to take a career tech program.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=903.032s">So</a>  the main value, I believe, is that you're getting a career in technical education while you're in high school and getting the academic portion of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=912.078s">Not</a>  only are you getting paid for college, you're also getting education that you would have had to pay for.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=917.182s">I</a>  think the most interesting projects we've participated in this week is our Candyland project. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=922.225s">It's</a>  our next display project. <a href="https://youtu.be/jO3ADh2wzWc&t=925.688s">And</a>  I am working on a cotton candy hairstyle.</p>
