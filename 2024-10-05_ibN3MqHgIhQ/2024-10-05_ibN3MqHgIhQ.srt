85
00:08:13,753 --> 00:08:14,914

[SPEAKER_02]: The guy was amazing on the street.

95

105
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:20,265
[SPEAKER_15]: He would wear his emotions on his sleeve and he wouldn't be afraid to say what he thought he needed to say for what was best for the city of Medford.

106
00:09:20,886 --> 00:09:24,648
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe from time to time, the rumors that he might have jumped over the rail a couple times.

107
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:31,924
[SPEAKER_15]: but he had so much passion to make sure that the city of Medford was represented in such a positive light.

108
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:46,874
[SPEAKER_15]: And he was a person that would take care and work for anyone in this community, whether it was in the Wellington area, West Medford, South Medford, even though he grew up, he was over at Charter Nav.

109
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:49,201
[SPEAKER_15]: he really fought for everybody.

110
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:52,302
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, it's a sad day that Mr Moody's passed.

111
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:57,144
[SPEAKER_15]: But I know that he's left a legacy with Gordon and Sean and Bobby.

[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

141
00:12:22,552 --> 00:12:24,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

142
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:25,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

143
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:29,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean the affirmative zero and the negative the motion passes the license is approved.

144
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:29,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

145
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:30,295
[SPEAKER_05]: Congratulations.

146
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:45,743
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

147
00:12:46,804 --> 00:13:03,517
[SPEAKER_05]: So while we're under suspension taking 23 dash 025 offered by Councilor Scarpelli be it resolved the city council and buddy member of the city administration Neil Osborne and a representative from the Medford fire department to discuss issues and concerns dealing with fire trucks and human resource questions.

148
00:13:04,404 --> 00:13:05,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

149
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:06,905
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Madam President.

150
00:13:07,005 --> 00:13:10,666
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that I appreciate Chief being here this evening.

151
00:13:10,726 --> 00:13:13,406
[SPEAKER_15]: I know that we just had a few concerns.

152
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:30,631
[SPEAKER_15]: One that I know that as we're looking at our budget coming forward and understanding that we might have some issues with the fleet and seeing what we need to do, we can do as a council to try to help move things along if we need to need to.

153
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:37,607
[SPEAKER_15]: to make sure that you get all the apparatus you need for the safety of your men and women.

154
00:13:37,687 --> 00:13:41,111
[SPEAKER_15]: So that'll be the first thing.

155
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:50,380
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I know that there were some concerns about benefits for new hirees, that we can shed some light.

156
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:55,007
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, the benefits for the new hires, that's human resources.

157
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:58,612
[SPEAKER_24]: So I'll have to have Mr. Osborne address you on that.

158
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:03,820
[SPEAKER_24]: I do know I have three members, two that were hired in February of 22 and the other one hired in September of 22.

159
00:14:07,677 --> 00:14:13,319
[SPEAKER_24]: that there's some sort of issue with the healthcare and human resources takes care of that end of it.

160
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:17,260
[SPEAKER_24]: So you'd have to ask Mr. Rogers what's going on there.

161
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,781
[SPEAKER_15]: Someone's here tonight, so I appreciate that.

162
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:23,062
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you can shed some light on our fleet, that would be.

163
00:14:23,242 --> 00:14:28,624
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, so the fleet, I'll just give you a brief summary of what's going on with the fleet.

164
00:14:29,584 --> 00:14:34,106
[SPEAKER_24]: Obviously, we have two new ladder trucks that we've experienced some warranty issues with them.

165
00:14:35,452 --> 00:14:38,553
[SPEAKER_24]: I have negotiated with Seagrave to extend the warranty another year.

166
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:41,834
[SPEAKER_24]: They have been really good standing behind me with repairing it.

167
00:14:42,354 --> 00:14:45,194
[SPEAKER_24]: The problem is, you know, the repairs sometimes take time.

168
00:14:45,894 --> 00:14:48,975
[SPEAKER_24]: So luckily we have two spares, so I've been able to juggle the spares.

169
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:54,296
[SPEAKER_24]: And one of the aerials is in Jersey right now, getting everything finished up on it.

170
00:14:55,217 --> 00:15:01,598
[SPEAKER_24]: The other one's currently in service, and then the other two spares are, one of them's operating, the other one's in the shop also.

171
00:15:01,957 --> 00:15:12,000
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, so as far as the pumps go, when trucks get to a certain age and a certain number of hours and mileage, they're at the end of their usable life.

172
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,802
[SPEAKER_24]: So we have two pumps that were purchased in 2000.

173
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:20,843
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's kind of self-explanatory, they're 23 years old.

174
00:15:21,624 --> 00:15:28,806
[SPEAKER_24]: They got pushed into the front line because of a premature frame failure on engine six, which is a 2008 PS Sabre.

175
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:33,935
[SPEAKER_24]: So that was something nobody could really foresee.

176
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:41,078
[SPEAKER_24]: It just, you know, we had it in for some maintenance and, you know, we examined the frame and we discovered that the frame was, you know, unsafe.

177
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:43,019
[SPEAKER_24]: So we were forced to put it out of service.

178
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,541
[SPEAKER_24]: So what that did was it brought these spare apparatus to the frontline.

179
00:15:48,342 --> 00:15:54,965
[SPEAKER_24]: And then we experienced a couple of, you know, major mechanical failures in those, which I was able to

180
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:06,648
[SPEAKER_24]: absorb in my budget it took up over half my maintenance budget but I was able to repair those and they're back from repairs and those are going to be run in the foreseeable future till we can get something new.

181
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:24,983
[SPEAKER_24]: As far as like what we're going to purchase when we're going to purchase it the mayor and I are working on that on a purchase plan to figure out what we can buy and how many and that's something that's like a in progress that I really can't tell you you know we're not there yet but we're working diligently to

182
00:16:25,543 --> 00:16:27,685
[SPEAKER_24]: figure out how we can get out of this problem.

183
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:43,679
[SPEAKER_24]: The other issue that's come into play is, and it's part of the sort of a result of the pandemic and the supply chain interruption is these trucks to build them now, it's up to 820 days from the time you complete the order to the time the truck arrives.

184
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,981
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's a little over two years.

185
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:48,943
[SPEAKER_24]: And then if you add in the time it takes to

186
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:55,131
[SPEAKER_24]: put radios in them, tablets, letter them, train the personnel.

187
00:16:55,151 --> 00:16:59,332
[SPEAKER_24]: You're talking two and a half years before you're gonna see them.

188
00:17:00,132 --> 00:17:01,332
[SPEAKER_24]: And that keeps going up.

189
00:17:01,872 --> 00:17:10,214
[SPEAKER_24]: Every time we wait, if we don't get it done, another month goes by, it's another month, and then we end up having to wait longer.

190
00:17:10,514 --> 00:17:15,795
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's why we were forced to kind of repair these older trucks to kind of keep the fleet operational.

191
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,856
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's where we're at with the fleet.

192
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:32,598
[SPEAKER_15]: If you have any questions, I'll yeah, so I know that one of some of the residents are asking that why is there a Boston truck and I don't know if we said maybe there was a fire and they were covering and then someone said what happened with the Boston truck was.

193
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:41,599
[SPEAKER_24]: When we experienced the two major component failures on the other two trucks, I was forced to borrow a truck from Boston.

194
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:44,300
[SPEAKER_24]: And they were gracious enough to give it to us for a period of time.

195
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,481
[SPEAKER_24]: And they do that for other departments in the metro fire area.

196
00:17:49,582 --> 00:17:55,904
[SPEAKER_24]: I have a good relationship with the chief and the mechanics in Boston, and they support us if I call them for something like that.

197
00:17:56,704 --> 00:18:02,289
[SPEAKER_24]: As long as they have something available, they'll lend it with the idea that they may need it back.

198
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:04,391
[SPEAKER_24]: If I get that phone call, I have to give it back.

199
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:06,632
[SPEAKER_24]: So it saved us from browning anything out.

200
00:18:06,672 --> 00:18:10,055
[SPEAKER_24]: We basically were running that Boston truck for a period of time.

201
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:16,060
[SPEAKER_15]: So this, I'll say it, Chief, this seems dire.

202
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:21,964
[SPEAKER_15]: This should have been something that this administration should have asked for two years ago.

203
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:28,561
[SPEAKER_15]: And this is something that is, do we have a representative from the administration?

204
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:32,265
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Neil Osborne, but I'm not seeing anyone.

205
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:33,986
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so that's a problem.

206
00:18:34,026 --> 00:18:42,035
[SPEAKER_15]: So I look at that because usually when you present a capital plan like this, it's in the capital projects.

207
00:18:42,992 --> 00:18:45,593
[SPEAKER_15]: We haven't seen, have we got an update?

208
00:18:46,214 --> 00:18:57,279
[SPEAKER_15]: So I know that, you know, I know that the mayor put out that the station, Main Street stations now going under this, that, and the other thing, and that's great, but these are the things that frighten me.

209
00:18:57,399 --> 00:19:02,482
[SPEAKER_15]: This is great if we have a brand new fire station, but, you know, are we gonna be,

210
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:08,101
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, rent in a U-Haul truck and throwing some ladders on the top, because we don't have fire engines.

211
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:21,447
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's what I fear right now, because as you're saying, two and a half years away, and we're in discussions about ordering them, I think this council needs to play a bigger role in this, Chief.

212
00:19:21,507 --> 00:19:30,651
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that we need to make a motion that we need to have an emergency meeting, as committee of the whole, with procurement office, with the mayor,

213
00:19:31,611 --> 00:19:37,404
[SPEAKER_15]: And really, let's try to figure out a way to get this audit sooner than later.

214
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:40,591
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I don't, I know it's not

215
00:19:42,022 --> 00:19:43,743
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not a popular thing, it's tough to be up there.

216
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:55,231
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it is, but from here, I know how dangerous your jobs are, and not to have the proper equipment that you need, whether it's turnout gear, whether it's fire trucks.

217
00:19:55,311 --> 00:19:58,453
[SPEAKER_24]: I literally, just so I can stop you for a second.

218
00:19:58,633 --> 00:19:59,474
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe I wasn't clear.

219
00:19:59,514 --> 00:20:03,356
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, so when we, the mayor and I discussed this,

220
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:14,365
[SPEAKER_24]: It takes a period of time for manufacturers to quote that price, you know, the price of the apparatus and that lead time that I was just telling you about that constantly changes.

221
00:20:14,986 --> 00:20:17,468
[SPEAKER_24]: And now they're only guaranteeing that for 30 days.

222
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:21,831
[SPEAKER_24]: So every time, if we go beyond the 30 days, it has to be recorded and then that takes time.

223
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:29,918
[SPEAKER_24]: So I recently, like two days ago, handed the mayor all the updated information on the price quote, the lead time.

224
00:20:30,738 --> 00:20:36,362
[SPEAKER_24]: And we are in discussions, like I said, on figuring out how we're going to fund that.

225
00:20:37,062 --> 00:20:41,044
[SPEAKER_24]: And that comes from her staff and her, not me.

226
00:20:41,224 --> 00:20:42,465
[SPEAKER_24]: I just give her the information.

227
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:47,709
[SPEAKER_24]: you know, she has to make that commitment where that's gonna be done.

228
00:20:47,749 --> 00:20:51,512
[SPEAKER_24]: And then once I get that, I can actually order the truck and get that clock ticking.

229
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:53,193
[SPEAKER_15]: Chief, I appreciate everything you do.

230
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,514
[SPEAKER_15]: I know this is nothing on you.

231
00:20:55,055 --> 00:21:02,701
[SPEAKER_15]: What I'm saying, sitting here, we've ordered fire trucks in the past with Chief Gilberti and this administration, the administration prior to that.

232
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:05,743
[SPEAKER_15]: So originally this council was involved.

233
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:06,584
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I'm trying to say.

234
00:21:07,004 --> 00:21:12,469
[SPEAKER_15]: If we're waiting for the 30 days and you're sitting with the mayor and she's putting something together with other different departments,

235
00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:15,212
[SPEAKER_15]: Guess who they have to come to to ask for the money?

236
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,615
[SPEAKER_15]: They have to come here and we know nothing about it.

237
00:21:18,296 --> 00:21:21,079
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sure there's other department heads that are all asking for their stuff.

238
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:22,661
[SPEAKER_24]: So she's looking at an entire city.

239
00:21:22,722 --> 00:21:24,003
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm just looking at one.

240
00:21:24,444 --> 00:21:27,267
[SPEAKER_15]: As a city councilor, what I'm saying, this is what I'm telling you.

241
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:27,808
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't have to.

242
00:21:28,249 --> 00:21:29,210
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm telling you what I see.

243
00:21:30,151 --> 00:21:33,534
[SPEAKER_15]: is that I don't care what other departments don't have paperclips.

244
00:21:34,054 --> 00:21:38,518
[SPEAKER_15]: Our firemen, firewomen don't have the equipment they need to succeed and be safe.

245
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:42,622
[SPEAKER_15]: So I know it's not it's not popular for you to say it, but I can say it chief and it's okay.

246
00:21:43,242 --> 00:21:52,590
[SPEAKER_15]: But I will tell you we need to have an emergency meeting with the mayor to see where this council falls in to make sure we're in the loop to make sure that we can hold meetings

247
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:58,577
[SPEAKER_15]: to clear any funding that we have to approve to make sure this happens within 30 days.

248
00:21:58,878 --> 00:21:59,819
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all I'm trying to say.

249
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,744
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm only saying this because I'm in your corner.

250
00:22:03,764 --> 00:22:07,208
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to support your people.

251
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:08,770
[SPEAKER_15]: This is something that

252
00:22:09,591 --> 00:22:26,760
[SPEAKER_15]: working here for 16 years, whether on the school committee, city council, we've been directly involved when we talked about the previous fire trucks or different, different, uh, you know, uh, expenditures that we put out, whether it was for police cars or a new station or whatnot, but we were involved.

253
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:30,342
[SPEAKER_15]: This council has yet to see updated financials.

254
00:22:30,802 --> 00:22:32,763
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're, we're, we're nervous chief.

255
00:22:33,203 --> 00:22:35,985
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm nervous that we're going to get to me and we're going to come here.

256
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:37,486
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to say, forget the fire trucks, George.

257
00:22:38,944 --> 00:22:41,265
[SPEAKER_15]: We might have to cut firemen or firewomen, and I don't want that.

258
00:22:42,285 --> 00:22:43,105
[SPEAKER_15]: This is what I'm saying.

259
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:55,029
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to get together with the chief, with the mayor's office, and really start, because they've gone publicly to different arenas, and they publicly mentioned how awful the budget's gonna be this year.

260
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:57,729
[SPEAKER_15]: And listen, I'm publicly saying this.

261
00:22:57,749 --> 00:22:58,730
[SPEAKER_15]: I've said it a thousand times.

262
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:04,371
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sounding redundant to everybody, and I sound like a crybaby at times, but I'm frightened.

263
00:23:04,711 --> 00:23:06,512
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm nervous, because I don't know what we're doing here.

264
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,202
[SPEAKER_15]: This council hasn't talked to anybody about what's going on.

265
00:23:10,782 --> 00:23:12,604
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you for coming.

266
00:23:12,664 --> 00:23:13,504
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for the update.

267
00:23:13,744 --> 00:23:27,894
[SPEAKER_15]: My recommendation is that we make motion that we call for an emergency meeting with the mayor's office to get an update on the capital plan dealing specifically with ordering the fire trucks within this 30-day window so the clock can start now.

268
00:23:27,914 --> 00:23:30,236
[SPEAKER_15]: Does 2020 code that, Chief?

269
00:23:30,256 --> 00:23:30,516
[SPEAKER_15]: 2020 trucks?

270
00:23:33,098 --> 00:23:37,579
[SPEAKER_15]: And the possibility is we have to make them last for at least another two and a half years if the clock started today.

271
00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:39,819
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's why we need to get the clock started.

272
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:46,460
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to do whatever we need to do as a council to jump ahead of anything needed that this council needs.

273
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:53,942
[SPEAKER_15]: So whatever we can do, that's all I'm asking, Chief, is to get the administration to sit down with us and say, whatever we need, let's get this done.

274
00:23:54,562 --> 00:23:56,182
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's understand if we can use our money.

275
00:23:56,222 --> 00:24:00,023
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's see if we can, you know, what other funding mechanisms we can use.

276
00:24:01,303 --> 00:24:02,664
[SPEAKER_15]: to make sure this happens right away.

277
00:24:02,785 --> 00:24:03,665
[SPEAKER_15]: That's that's all I'm saying.

278
00:24:03,685 --> 00:24:05,467
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, I'll give you an example.

279
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:06,969
[SPEAKER_15]: Sounds pretty dire.

280
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:09,051
[SPEAKER_15]: We're down a few a few trucks.

281
00:24:09,811 --> 00:24:14,116
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a we have a motion later on resolution today for another $1.5 million in sidewalks.

282
00:24:15,116 --> 00:24:15,277
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

283
00:24:16,618 --> 00:24:19,540
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't we haven't even know we don't know where the last 1.5 went last year.

284
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:22,983
[SPEAKER_15]: So before I these are the issues that we don't know about.

285
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:28,467
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why I asked you to come up and I know it's I know and I don't make I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable in any way chief.

286
00:24:28,507 --> 00:24:30,288
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you're doing an amazing job.

287
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:34,271
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, you have one of the best departments in the city.

288
00:24:34,912 --> 00:24:40,136
[SPEAKER_15]: I know and I speak firsthand for the way they treated my mom and my dad when they when they were leaving the service.

289
00:24:40,176 --> 00:24:42,537
[SPEAKER_15]: So I can't say enough about them.

290
00:24:42,618 --> 00:24:44,239
[SPEAKER_15]: So but

291
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:48,517
[SPEAKER_15]: We know, we can see the issues, but we haven't heard anything.

292
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:51,080
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why having you come up and just shed some light, I appreciate it.

293
00:24:51,301 --> 00:24:51,881
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.

294
00:24:52,082 --> 00:24:52,382
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

295
00:24:58,569 --> 00:24:59,350
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Madam President.

296
00:24:59,410 --> 00:24:59,571
[SPEAKER_14]: Chief.

297
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:10,421
[SPEAKER_14]: I know in the past, I think our last one, didn't we do a lease to own on our last two fire trucks?

298
00:25:10,781 --> 00:25:12,462
[SPEAKER_24]: We did lease purchase on both ladders.

299
00:25:12,482 --> 00:25:12,703
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

300
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:15,284
[SPEAKER_24]: And tied them with the casino money.

301
00:25:15,464 --> 00:25:16,345
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

302
00:25:16,365 --> 00:25:21,428
[SPEAKER_24]: So they did a 10-year lease on each truck, and that money each year pays for the lease purchase.

303
00:25:21,689 --> 00:25:23,069
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a 10-year lease purchase.

304
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,212
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm assuming we're going to look to do the same thing going forward?

305
00:25:27,172 --> 00:25:29,174
[SPEAKER_24]: That's a question you have to ask the administration.

306
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,315
[SPEAKER_24]: It all depends on how they want to fund it.

307
00:25:31,495 --> 00:25:34,317
[SPEAKER_24]: There's many different ways they could choose to fund it.

308
00:25:35,177 --> 00:25:39,858
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know between you and the former chief how long it takes to get these trucks.

309
00:25:41,219 --> 00:25:41,779
[SPEAKER_14]: Say that again.

310
00:25:42,139 --> 00:25:46,480
[SPEAKER_14]: I said I know between yourself and the former chief how long it takes to get a fire truck.

311
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,080
[SPEAKER_14]: I know it takes almost.

312
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,782
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's what I was trying to explain earlier was that that time frame keeps changing.

313
00:25:54,282 --> 00:26:00,303
[SPEAKER_24]: So at the end of 30 days, say a bunch of departments order 50 trucks, that could turn into 900.

314
00:26:00,463 --> 00:26:04,064
[SPEAKER_24]: It could just keep going up because you get behind in the line.

315
00:26:05,137 --> 00:26:06,898
[SPEAKER_14]: And I thank Councilor Scott for bringing that up.

316
00:26:06,938 --> 00:26:07,519
[SPEAKER_14]: And what does she mean?

317
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:12,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the three workhorses in the community are the police, fire, and DPW.

318
00:26:13,504 --> 00:26:15,786
[SPEAKER_14]: And what about those three departments?

319
00:26:16,406 --> 00:26:20,409
[SPEAKER_24]: So like for example, the ladder trucks, they took 400 days back then.

320
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:28,656
[SPEAKER_24]: But since the pandemic and the supply chain interruption and material shortages, all the departments are in the same kind of problem.

321
00:26:28,716 --> 00:26:29,677
[SPEAKER_24]: They're trying to get trucks.

322
00:26:30,337 --> 00:26:36,042
[SPEAKER_24]: And what happens is that lead time just keeps going up and up and up as more and more departments order.

323
00:26:36,882 --> 00:26:40,746
[SPEAKER_24]: And like I said, that supply chain interruption, we're still seeing the effects of that.

324
00:26:44,246 --> 00:26:44,586
[SPEAKER_14]: market?

325
00:26:44,986 --> 00:26:45,547
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

326
00:26:45,827 --> 00:26:47,928
[SPEAKER_24]: Right now, we looked around, there's nothing around.

327
00:26:47,948 --> 00:26:49,089
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I don't know.

328
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:49,569
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

329
00:26:49,629 --> 00:26:51,850
[SPEAKER_24]: Obviously, obviously entertain that.

330
00:26:51,971 --> 00:26:57,314
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, like, we borrow from Boston, I even tried to buy one of those.

331
00:26:57,674 --> 00:26:58,434
[SPEAKER_24]: Just too precious.

332
00:26:58,454 --> 00:26:59,395
[SPEAKER_24]: They're not letting go of them.

333
00:26:59,795 --> 00:26:59,975
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

334
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:01,356
[SPEAKER_24]: So and then there's nothing around.

335
00:27:01,396 --> 00:27:02,477
[SPEAKER_24]: We just we looked around.

336
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:03,297
[SPEAKER_24]: There really isn't.

337
00:27:03,838 --> 00:27:04,938
[SPEAKER_24]: Everyone's in the same.

338
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:05,999
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not just Medford.

339
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:07,760
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not a whole metro fire community.

340
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:12,983
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, we try to see if we could, you know, like,

341
00:27:13,905 --> 00:27:16,347
[SPEAKER_24]: work on a purchase for some of those used trucks.

342
00:27:17,267 --> 00:27:25,452
[SPEAKER_24]: And even though they're not ideal, when we have a component failure on the two older 23-year-old trucks, that's not something ideal.

343
00:27:25,472 --> 00:27:29,735
[SPEAKER_24]: I didn't want to fix those, but I had to because I couldn't find anything better used.

344
00:27:30,255 --> 00:27:31,736
[SPEAKER_24]: We knew exactly what those were.

345
00:27:32,648 --> 00:27:38,973
[SPEAKER_24]: And it was, it was a lot of money, but you know, I had enough in the budget that I could absorb it, but it took up over half my maintenance budget.

346
00:27:38,993 --> 00:27:45,859
[SPEAKER_24]: So what's going to happen in the summer when we got a maintenance stuff, we're going to get, it's going to be very tight this year because of those failures.

347
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,041
[SPEAKER_24]: So, um,

348
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:53,811
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, that's, and the other issue that happens is if you don't have spares, you can't maintenance the fleet.

349
00:27:54,071 --> 00:27:54,391
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

350
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:58,072
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's not like I'm, you know, adding an extra truck so I can have extra trucks.

351
00:27:58,152 --> 00:28:01,333
[SPEAKER_24]: It's, you know, if engine one needs maintenance, you gotta have something to back it up.

352
00:28:01,373 --> 00:28:05,334
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, no, and I understand, you know, when they go off for repairs, they're out there for a couple of months.

353
00:28:06,395 --> 00:28:10,856
[SPEAKER_24]: So the other issue that's happening is we're running, our run totals went way up.

354
00:28:10,896 --> 00:28:14,097
[SPEAKER_24]: So we went from, say, under 10,000 to over 12.

355
00:28:14,477 --> 00:28:16,277
[SPEAKER_24]: We're almost 13,000 runs a year.

356
00:28:16,898 --> 00:28:18,198
[SPEAKER_24]: So now engine one, for example,

357
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:20,809
[SPEAKER_24]: 73,000 miles on it already.

358
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,054
[SPEAKER_24]: So, you know, it's a 2018.

359
00:28:24,156 --> 00:28:29,407
[SPEAKER_24]: So think about that, you know, those trucks are in two and a half years, they're going to have almost 100,000 miles on them.

360
00:28:31,212 --> 00:28:32,612
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's the other issue.

361
00:28:32,652 --> 00:28:35,073
[SPEAKER_24]: We're trying to get them ordered so we can rotate the fleet.

362
00:28:35,093 --> 00:28:41,534
[SPEAKER_24]: Like in the past, we'd get them in before they got, like say they get to 40,000, then we rotate them and the new stuff comes in.

363
00:28:41,574 --> 00:28:52,056
[SPEAKER_24]: But because of this huge two and a half year delay, engine one and engine four, they're gonna run to the point where they're gonna have almost 100,000 on them when we go to rotate.

364
00:28:52,876 --> 00:28:57,037
[SPEAKER_14]: And you know, I would hope that, you know, going forward that, you know, the plan would be to,

365
00:28:59,992 --> 00:29:06,956
[SPEAKER_14]: As soon as we buy one and get it delivered, we order another one just to keep rotating.

366
00:29:07,116 --> 00:29:10,618
[SPEAKER_24]: Some cities have, like I put some stuff into the CIP.

367
00:29:10,658 --> 00:29:12,820
[SPEAKER_24]: If you look at it, it's there.

368
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,362
[SPEAKER_24]: You know, to buy one a year till we get three of them or buy three up front.

369
00:29:17,402 --> 00:29:18,503
[SPEAKER_24]: There's different options you can do.

370
00:29:19,229 --> 00:29:28,876
[SPEAKER_24]: But with the delay, if you buy one a year, so we would get the first one in 25, and then the second one would come in 26, and then 27, you'd start to see some relief.

371
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:32,860
[SPEAKER_24]: But in other cities, what they do is they don't keep trucks this long.

372
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:39,344
[SPEAKER_24]: They have city ordinances where they, every so many years you buy a pump, and every so many years you buy a ladder.

373
00:29:40,385 --> 00:29:46,370
[SPEAKER_24]: Before they get to that age where they're having those major component failures that I was talking about.

374
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:49,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe that's an ordinance that we look to put in going forward.

375
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:56,913
[SPEAKER_24]: I thank you for- Yeah, maybe going forward we can present those kind of ideas, look into what other cities do and come up with a plan.

376
00:29:56,973 --> 00:29:59,114
[SPEAKER_24]: But right now we're kind of in an emergency mode.

377
00:29:59,134 --> 00:30:01,354
[SPEAKER_24]: We've got to kind of correct what's wrong here first.

378
00:30:01,914 --> 00:30:05,976
[SPEAKER_14]: And let me say, your department, lives matter in your department.

379
00:30:06,256 --> 00:30:06,876
[SPEAKER_14]: You save lives.

380
00:30:06,896 --> 00:30:14,358
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would hope that we can get this emergency meeting in so you can get your 30 days and get it off and going because they say,

381
00:30:16,101 --> 00:30:17,882
[SPEAKER_14]: two years.

382
00:30:17,902 --> 00:30:21,384
[SPEAKER_24]: I do have to say this is that we were literally talking today.

383
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:22,264
[SPEAKER_24]: We're going to work on it.

384
00:30:22,344 --> 00:30:26,746
[SPEAKER_24]: So I think what we just need to do is guys, if you want to be involved, we'll just stop talking.

385
00:30:26,766 --> 00:30:28,347
[SPEAKER_14]: We can do a little more work and a little more action.

386
00:30:29,468 --> 00:30:33,450
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to say also, I'm going to support councilor Scott's motion to have an emergency meeting.

387
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:36,251
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, you can get that order up there as quick as possible.

388
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:37,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

389
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:37,572
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

390
00:30:37,632 --> 00:30:37,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

391
00:30:39,973 --> 00:30:43,815
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion from the councilors on this part of the resolution?

392
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:47,659
[SPEAKER_05]: And back to you, Councilor Scott Peli.

393
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:48,159
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

394
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:49,259
[SPEAKER_15]: Is Mr. Osborne present?

395
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:49,780
[SPEAKER_05]: He is.

396
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:56,682
[SPEAKER_15]: He is online.

397
00:30:56,702 --> 00:31:01,664
[SPEAKER_21]: Good evening, Council President Morell and other members of the City Council.

398
00:31:02,465 --> 00:31:10,147
[SPEAKER_21]: I know back in early February, I was asked to summarize the issue with a few firefighters.

399
00:31:10,187 --> 00:31:14,109
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know if Councilor Scott Peli has a specific question or any other.

400
00:31:15,013 --> 00:31:16,615
[SPEAKER_21]: Members of the Council have questions.

401
00:31:17,336 --> 00:31:23,925
[SPEAKER_21]: I know since then when the issue was brought to my attention, we have improved our communication with new hires.

402
00:31:24,766 --> 00:31:33,037
[SPEAKER_21]: Initially back in February we were asking them to come to City Council, come to Human Resources to make an appointment to make sure the paperwork got done.

403
00:31:33,857 --> 00:31:34,998
[SPEAKER_21]: done timely.

404
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:59,536
[SPEAKER_21]: We have now set specific time frames when a new person is hired, it doesn't matter whether it's fire, DPW or police, there's a specific time frame where they're going to come, meet with the benefits coordinator so that anyone who actually wants the city insurance can sign up for it and have it be filed with GIC in a timely manner so that they can actually have coverage.

405
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:06,271
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, I don't know if there's any specific question that you would like to have answered, available to answer anything that I can.

406
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:07,852
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you.

407
00:32:08,012 --> 00:32:09,612
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate the response.

408
00:32:10,072 --> 00:32:28,499
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think probably my biggest question is that, I know the fire was first brought up, but since then, I was told that there might be some concerns with new hires at DPW, and new hires with the police department, and the lack of truly, lack of true communication with going back and forth.

409
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:35,522
[SPEAKER_15]: that you sent us a clarifying email, and I appreciate that, but I have a question on that.

410
00:32:36,942 --> 00:32:43,825
[SPEAKER_15]: It seems that the comment that when open enrollment is closed, there's no way to get anybody on, correct?

411
00:32:44,646 --> 00:32:45,326
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that correct?

412
00:32:45,985 --> 00:32:47,227
[SPEAKER_21]: It's extremely difficult.

413
00:32:47,407 --> 00:32:49,910
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, we are a member of GIC.

414
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:59,581
[SPEAKER_21]: They are the gatekeepers, and we do our best to try and make sure that any employee who is new to us has the opportunity to sign up.

415
00:33:01,098 --> 00:33:23,803
[SPEAKER_15]: So just so you know, Mr. Osborne, I did contact a couple of neighboring communities and talked with the benefits managers, and I know that they have different systems set up that it's a 60-day waiting period once they are hired, no matter what month of the year it is, that if they were hired in January and February, they would then be, you know,

416
00:33:24,543 --> 00:33:27,165
[SPEAKER_15]: added on to the insurance for GIC on April 1st.

417
00:33:27,546 --> 00:33:28,466
[SPEAKER_15]: That's for example.

418
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:31,008
[SPEAKER_15]: Another example is February to March.

419
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,950
[SPEAKER_15]: They would then be hired May 1st.

420
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,051
[SPEAKER_15]: They would have the GIC.

421
00:33:35,252 --> 00:33:42,197
[SPEAKER_15]: I've talked to a few people in a few HI departments that have also told me that it's not uncommon

422
00:33:43,178 --> 00:33:52,504
[SPEAKER_15]: for a relationship with the members of GIC and I have a call with them tomorrow to just give them a call and say, hey, listen, be a little persistent.

423
00:33:52,524 --> 00:34:01,170
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe one benefits person told me that all she really needs to do is call them three times in a day and they'll get somebody on if it's really needed.

424
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:08,875
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that's that, I'm a little confused with what you sent and then what I've heard from GIC itself.

425
00:34:09,135 --> 00:34:10,116
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the other piece is,

426
00:34:12,654 --> 00:34:14,655
[SPEAKER_15]: are all the firefighters that were hired.

427
00:34:15,116 --> 00:34:18,858
[SPEAKER_15]: I know back in February that wants insurance.

428
00:34:19,499 --> 00:34:22,901
[SPEAKER_15]: Have they been given their insurance or are they still waiting for the insurance?

429
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:32,267
[SPEAKER_15]: Second question is, do there's still issues with the police that had some concerns and some issues and with DPW?

430
00:34:32,547 --> 00:34:33,808
[SPEAKER_15]: If you can answer that, that'd be great.

431
00:34:34,816 --> 00:34:39,940
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess I can only answer for those who brought that issue to my attention.

432
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,903
[SPEAKER_21]: So the key component of getting someone insurance is for them to sign up for it.

433
00:34:44,943 --> 00:34:51,567
[SPEAKER_21]: There's no automatic way for us in human resources to decide what an individual will want.

434
00:34:51,627 --> 00:35:00,673
[SPEAKER_21]: So if they come to us, we can figure out exactly what their needs are and then try and work with them if they don't have insurance to try and get them insurance.

435
00:35:01,374 --> 00:35:04,256
[SPEAKER_21]: Right now, I don't know of anyone on the fire that

436
00:35:05,597 --> 00:35:08,459
[SPEAKER_21]: wanted insurance and it's without insurance, doesn't have it.

437
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:22,450
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so that's alarming to me because I think that when I hire a new person in my position, I work with my HR benefits coordinator in the HR.

438
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:25,192
[SPEAKER_15]: As they go on to the onboarding process,

439
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:28,786
[SPEAKER_15]: the, this is part of their process.

440
00:35:29,286 --> 00:35:39,710
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you telling us that when they're going through the onboarding process, when they're hired for the city of Medford, that that's not the job of the HR department to follow through to make sure they're doing that?

441
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:43,932
[SPEAKER_15]: Because you're making it sound that they have to come to you separately and ask for it.

442
00:35:44,412 --> 00:35:55,201
[SPEAKER_21]: So that was back in February, the offer letter specifically said, hey, come make an appointment so that we have the opportunity to figure out what you need, get the paperwork signed and get it in.

443
00:35:55,942 --> 00:36:06,051
[SPEAKER_21]: Unfortunately, back in February, there was a lack of staff that happened that reduced the ability to respond quickly.

444
00:36:06,852 --> 00:36:11,916
[SPEAKER_21]: But once the issue was brought to our attention, we began to work with any firefighter that didn't have it.

445
00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:16,941
[SPEAKER_21]: and sort of make that request to GIC to see what could be done.

446
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:26,765
[SPEAKER_21]: And again, from the group that started in February, I don't know of anyone of that group who has come to Human Resources and said, hey, we need help.

447
00:36:26,845 --> 00:36:28,806
[SPEAKER_21]: And again, we remain open and available.

448
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:29,907
[SPEAKER_21]: Come talk to us.

449
00:36:30,327 --> 00:36:33,809
[SPEAKER_21]: It's easier if you make an appointment, then we can give you the dedicated time.

450
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:41,012
[SPEAKER_21]: I know folks, no matter what department you work in, you can stop in at HR, but you can get better service if you just give us a little heads up.

451
00:36:44,028 --> 00:36:51,522
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm not just putting blame, I know that you seem to be a team of one, Mr. Osborne.

452
00:36:52,304 --> 00:36:54,408
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we're fortunate that we have

453
00:36:55,393 --> 00:37:02,618
[SPEAKER_15]: teams of six to eight that are working where we're onboarding people, at least that's what it sounds like to me, that you're alone.

454
00:37:02,738 --> 00:37:06,580
[SPEAKER_15]: So that seems to be an issue in itself.

455
00:37:07,281 --> 00:37:23,752
[SPEAKER_15]: So right now, you know, no firemen, that everybody has, I know that I've gotten some calls from firemen that they still haven't had their insurance applied to their benefits,

456
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:27,112
[SPEAKER_15]: but no one's reached out to you to let you know that.

457
00:37:27,732 --> 00:37:27,893
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

458
00:37:27,933 --> 00:37:38,341
[SPEAKER_21]: So again, I know the union has brought it to our attention and we've asked them if a firefighter has an issue, please bring it to our attention.

459
00:37:38,441 --> 00:37:39,722
[SPEAKER_21]: We can meet with them, figure it out.

460
00:37:40,422 --> 00:37:46,587
[SPEAKER_21]: I know I've written one of the employees from February saying just to make sure that there was no miscommunication.

461
00:37:46,687 --> 00:37:48,889
[SPEAKER_21]: If you have an issue, come talk to us.

462
00:37:48,949 --> 00:37:49,729
[SPEAKER_21]: We can figure it out.

463
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:50,770
[SPEAKER_21]: That's what our role is.

464
00:37:51,131 --> 00:37:52,832
[SPEAKER_21]: We're there to try and provide that service.

465
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:57,626
[SPEAKER_21]: to the employees and also assist department heads when they get new employees.

466
00:37:57,646 --> 00:37:58,708
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're there.

467
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:00,331
[SPEAKER_21]: Come talk to us.

468
00:38:00,371 --> 00:38:03,617
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll gladly do whatever we can to try and help folks out.

469
00:38:06,405 --> 00:38:24,077
[SPEAKER_15]: If I can, I know that representatives Buckley and Jones have reached out and mentioned that they would like to come to the meeting and maybe if you can, if there's any way, gentlemen, if you can, just enlighten me.

470
00:38:25,018 --> 00:38:35,505
[SPEAKER_15]: I was told, I was led to believe that there were firemen and women that were hired back in February that have yet to be granted insurance.

471
00:38:36,165 --> 00:38:40,408
[SPEAKER_15]: or offered other avenues to get their own insurance.

472
00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:46,253
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want to make sure that if this is a wrong that we fix it, that

473
00:38:47,987 --> 00:38:52,008
[SPEAKER_15]: We look at the departments that need to get on board to make sure this happens.

474
00:38:52,428 --> 00:38:59,890
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know that the police reached out as well, and representatives from DPW had some same concerns.

475
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:09,052
[SPEAKER_15]: And I guess that since they're not specific to this, I'll call for a separate resolution with the police to understand how that's transpired.

476
00:39:09,995 --> 00:39:14,318
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, if you could shed some light and your members appreciate just name and address for the record.

477
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:18,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Walter Buckley, president of 10 32 method firefighters, 3 47 street.

478
00:39:19,881 --> 00:39:27,965
[SPEAKER_13]: So we currently have three members working for the fight apartment that do not have health insurance to the city that one health insurance to the city.

479
00:39:29,146 --> 00:39:31,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, the first one is Brian Lee.

480
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:37,271
[SPEAKER_13]: He received a letter from the city on February 2nd standing yet to meet with H. R.

481
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:42,208
[SPEAKER_13]: and set up an appointment to go over their benefits.

482
00:39:43,488 --> 00:39:50,390
[SPEAKER_13]: And I believe the GIC requires you to sign up for insurance within 60 days of your first day of getting paid.

483
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,451
[SPEAKER_13]: So he was not, he never made the appointment apparently.

484
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:58,332
[SPEAKER_13]: He got the letter, you have a lot of things running through your head when you're going to the fire academy.

485
00:39:58,752 --> 00:40:03,854
[SPEAKER_13]: You gotta get your shit together, you have to resign probably from your former job.

486
00:40:03,874 --> 00:40:05,254
[SPEAKER_13]: Ship together.

487
00:40:05,314 --> 00:40:06,535
[SPEAKER_13]: Ship, yes.

488
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:07,495
[SPEAKER_13]: One of them was a sailor.

489
00:40:11,798 --> 00:40:14,018
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, I apologize.

490
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:17,219
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not fun being up here for this.

491
00:40:18,879 --> 00:40:20,800
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to buy equipment, clothing.

492
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:25,701
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to get your life together because you're going away for a couple of months at the academy.

493
00:40:26,701 --> 00:40:40,184
[SPEAKER_13]: So yeah, maybe it slipped someone's mind that when he got the letter, he didn't sign up for the insurance, but you would think it's the HR department's job to reach out to those members and say, hey, you don't have insurance.

494
00:40:40,224 --> 00:40:41,264
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to get your insurance.

495
00:40:42,298 --> 00:40:55,848
[SPEAKER_13]: They do require you, the city HR department requires you to provide proof of insurance when you opt out of our insurance, but they don't require proof of insurance in the initial.

496
00:40:56,148 --> 00:40:58,270
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you want to opt in, you opt in.

497
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:02,413
[SPEAKER_13]: If you don't want the insurance, they don't say, where's your proof?

498
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:03,734
[SPEAKER_13]: We need proof of insurance.

499
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:09,944
[SPEAKER_13]: So to us, it means that they only require proof of insurance when it's gonna cost the city money.

500
00:41:10,685 --> 00:41:12,205
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't care that you don't have insurance.

501
00:41:12,225 --> 00:41:20,409
[SPEAKER_13]: They're not gonna ask you if you have proof of insurance because we have three guys that don't have insurance right now and they never called them and said, hey, you don't have insurance, you need to sign up.

502
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:22,370
[SPEAKER_15]: So if I can interrupt.

503
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,571
[SPEAKER_15]: So I know it's a two month period.

504
00:41:25,091 --> 00:41:27,172
[SPEAKER_15]: So we figured out in February, they didn't have insurance.

505
00:41:27,892 --> 00:41:29,413
[SPEAKER_15]: So they didn't have that meeting.

506
00:41:30,033 --> 00:41:30,774
[SPEAKER_15]: It's still a year.

507
00:41:31,594 --> 00:41:33,075
[SPEAKER_15]: Have they had that meeting since then?

508
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:36,240
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, so the first one, Brian Lee.

509
00:41:37,181 --> 00:41:39,503
[SPEAKER_13]: Completed the paperwork in May of 2022.

510
00:41:41,644 --> 00:41:45,487
[SPEAKER_13]: Was told by HR that his paycheck would reflect it in June or July.

511
00:41:45,987 --> 00:41:47,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Went back to HR in August.

512
00:41:47,909 --> 00:41:49,570
[SPEAKER_13]: Was told to resubmit the paperwork.

513
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,452
[SPEAKER_13]: Went back to HR in October or November.

514
00:41:53,252 --> 00:41:55,334
[SPEAKER_13]: Was told he never handed in the paperwork.

515
00:41:55,814 --> 00:42:00,358
[SPEAKER_13]: And then was told he did hand in the paperwork, but there was a communication problem with GIC.

516
00:42:01,929 --> 00:42:09,676
[SPEAKER_13]: In January of 2023, same individual met with Neil and Candace, was told paperwork was submitted to GIC but delayed.

517
00:42:10,636 --> 00:42:14,259
[SPEAKER_13]: Was told he would have to wait till April 2023 for open enrollment.

518
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:23,427
[SPEAKER_13]: In the meantime, he could pay for his outside insurance and he would be reimbursed up to 85% for all costs.

519
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:29,693
[SPEAKER_13]: Candace apologized and stated it might have been their fault and Neil landed on the GIC.

520
00:42:30,933 --> 00:42:37,317
[SPEAKER_13]: Candace took his information again, said she would write a letter to the GIC because she thought it was their fault.

521
00:42:38,298 --> 00:42:43,921
[SPEAKER_13]: And if the paperwork is accepted in April, he won't have any insurance till July of 2023.

522
00:42:44,001 --> 00:42:53,507
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're saying right now, if Mr. Lee submits his paperwork in April, he's out of that 60 day period to sign up.

523
00:42:54,288 --> 00:42:59,091
[SPEAKER_13]: They're saying if it's approved, he'll have insurance in July.

524
00:43:00,506 --> 00:43:06,688
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, imagine working for a year and saying, I have no insurance, I have no insurance, I have no insurance.

525
00:43:06,909 --> 00:43:15,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Open enrollment comes in and they're telling them, if you get accepted, like, people have families and kids and bills and prescriptions.

526
00:43:17,032 --> 00:43:19,473
[SPEAKER_13]: They have to deal with this, nevermind the job that we do.

527
00:43:19,493 --> 00:43:20,934
[SPEAKER_13]: We have to deal with that.

528
00:43:22,014 --> 00:43:25,996
[SPEAKER_13]: And to deal with this administration, and that's one person, Sonny Borelli.

529
00:43:26,736 --> 00:43:28,177
[SPEAKER_13]: He didn't even know he didn't have insurance.

530
00:43:29,269 --> 00:43:31,671
[SPEAKER_13]: So he didn't call him up and say, hey, you didn't sign up for insurance.

531
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:34,532
[SPEAKER_13]: He didn't even know until July that he didn't have insurance.

532
00:43:35,373 --> 00:43:41,137
[SPEAKER_13]: He's a single guy, so he's probably not thinking, oh, I gotta get my wife and kids and whatever.

533
00:43:41,177 --> 00:43:43,978
[SPEAKER_13]: So we contacted him July 1st of 2022.

534
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:47,160
[SPEAKER_13]: July 6th, he went to speak with Neil Osborne.

535
00:43:48,121 --> 00:43:53,524
[SPEAKER_13]: Neil told him he couldn't help him because the benefits coordinator wasn't in the office and to come back next week.

536
00:43:54,945 --> 00:43:55,285
[SPEAKER_13]: July 13th,

537
00:43:56,485 --> 00:43:59,606
[SPEAKER_13]: He spoke with Candace and received the health benefits package.

538
00:44:00,226 --> 00:44:02,467
[SPEAKER_13]: July 20th, he returned the package completed.

539
00:44:02,487 --> 00:44:05,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Neil was in the office.

540
00:44:05,387 --> 00:44:09,008
[SPEAKER_13]: He said he didn't want to take it and he was told to come back and give it to Candace.

541
00:44:10,109 --> 00:44:12,809
[SPEAKER_13]: July 27th, he handed the completed package to Candace.

542
00:44:13,069 --> 00:44:18,171
[SPEAKER_13]: So three times he went to the HR and twice he was turned away from the HR director.

543
00:44:19,011 --> 00:44:19,631
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't help you.

544
00:44:20,611 --> 00:44:22,392
[SPEAKER_13]: What's your job if you're the director of HR?

545
00:44:24,465 --> 00:44:28,588
[SPEAKER_13]: If you can't help someone when they come in and need help, what's gonna happen to that person when he leaves?

546
00:44:29,168 --> 00:44:32,371
[SPEAKER_15]: So more importantly, so July, everything was handed in.

547
00:44:32,991 --> 00:44:33,331
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

548
00:44:33,551 --> 00:44:35,233
[SPEAKER_15]: August, September, he should have been on.

549
00:44:35,733 --> 00:44:36,293
[SPEAKER_15]: Is he on now?

550
00:44:37,134 --> 00:44:37,574
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

551
00:44:39,876 --> 00:44:44,559
[SPEAKER_13]: Jeremiah O'Brien received a letter on August 11th, 2022.

552
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,662
[SPEAKER_13]: He was required to meet with HR on August 24th, 2022 at 5.30.

553
00:44:48,702 --> 00:44:49,483
[SPEAKER_13]: He didn't show up to that meeting.

554
00:44:53,288 --> 00:45:05,371
[SPEAKER_13]: But he did get sworn in on, I believe it was 9-15 or 9-13, where he completed all the paperwork at his swearing.

555
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:08,932
[SPEAKER_13]: He graduated the academy November 28th of 2022.

556
00:45:12,011 --> 00:45:22,334
[SPEAKER_13]: December 16th, he went to HR and was told they were working on the issue, and if he was paying for insurance or medical costs, to turn in the receipts and he would be reimbursed.

557
00:45:22,895 --> 00:45:25,415
[SPEAKER_13]: And he filled out a second healthcare package.

558
00:45:26,556 --> 00:45:39,420
[SPEAKER_13]: July 29th, he filled out his third healthcare package, was told they are doing their best to get him covered and working with GIC, and that HR would contact him regarding this issue.

559
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:52,160
[SPEAKER_13]: January 16th, 2023, he went to HR and was told that he never turned in his paperwork, or that they might have misplaced them.

560
00:45:53,801 --> 00:46:02,847
[SPEAKER_13]: He was then told it was too late to enroll, but they would contact him when they get an answer from HR regarding this health insurance issue.

561
00:46:03,247 --> 00:46:06,930
[SPEAKER_13]: That was January 16th, no one has contacted him since.

562
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:13,380
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are the three members that do not have health insurance right now, that want health insurance.

563
00:46:16,782 --> 00:46:21,783
[SPEAKER_15]: So if I can, Mr. Osborne, if you're still there, I don't.

564
00:46:24,338 --> 00:46:37,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Obviously, is there a way that we can, first of all, correct this by helping these three firefighters get their GIC benefits ASAP?

565
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:47,562
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I know that talking to, there's an open pipeline when you express these concerns to GIC directly with issues like this.

566
00:46:48,682 --> 00:46:50,122
[SPEAKER_15]: It takes days to get them on.

567
00:46:50,203 --> 00:46:52,883
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there any way, do we have that possible in Medford or no?

568
00:46:55,356 --> 00:47:00,338
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, uh, through the, uh, council president, the answer to that question is no.

569
00:47:00,939 --> 00:47:09,083
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, I'm not going to go, um, item for item over the misstatements made by, uh, uh, Mr. Buckley.

570
00:47:09,663 --> 00:47:15,226
[SPEAKER_21]: We as a human resources department remain committed to helping employees.

571
00:47:15,686 --> 00:47:23,810
[SPEAKER_21]: They may not have, uh, but the city's available insurance, but if they get to us and they talk to us about what they need.

572
00:47:24,494 --> 00:47:28,458
[SPEAKER_21]: We will do our best to help them, which includes having discussions with D.I.C.

573
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,382
[SPEAKER_21]: If I could to the chair, please.

574
00:47:33,263 --> 00:47:35,004
[SPEAKER_13]: We've we've gone to numerous times.

575
00:47:35,885 --> 00:47:37,747
[SPEAKER_13]: Numerous people have gone to numerous times.

576
00:47:37,927 --> 00:47:39,188
[SPEAKER_13]: These people still don't have insurance.

577
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:39,869
[SPEAKER_13]: So how are you?

578
00:47:43,012 --> 00:47:46,615
[SPEAKER_15]: So, so, Mr. Osmond, what I'm trying to figure out is if we

579
00:47:48,051 --> 00:48:00,798
[SPEAKER_15]: If we talk with the firefighters that are in question, and they come to your office tomorrow, do we have someone in place that can assist them to make sure that this is corrected and we don't, nothing happens again?

580
00:48:00,858 --> 00:48:03,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether it's one side or the other right now, I don't care.

581
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,821
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanna make sure these firefighters have insurance.

582
00:48:07,222 --> 00:48:07,702
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that possible?

583
00:48:07,722 --> 00:48:12,665
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, let's make sure, through the chair, we need to be talking about the same things.

584
00:48:13,465 --> 00:48:16,347
[SPEAKER_21]: Having insurance is different from having the city's insurance.

585
00:48:17,497 --> 00:48:23,719
[SPEAKER_21]: The group insurance commission controls when someone is eligible for insurance.

586
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:27,680
[SPEAKER_21]: We can't wave a magic wand and make it happen today or tomorrow.

587
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,540
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a process that has to be followed.

588
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,241
[SPEAKER_21]: And again, I keep saying it.

589
00:48:32,761 --> 00:48:34,981
[SPEAKER_21]: Have the individuals come and speak with us.

590
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:36,702
[SPEAKER_21]: Simply make an appointment.

591
00:48:36,742 --> 00:48:38,082
[SPEAKER_21]: You get the dedicated time.

592
00:48:38,826 --> 00:48:39,707
[SPEAKER_21]: We've got a lot to do.

593
00:48:39,867 --> 00:48:43,029
[SPEAKER_21]: We're trying to manage a lot of different other employees.

594
00:48:43,649 --> 00:48:46,251
[SPEAKER_21]: If the employee needs our service, come in.

595
00:48:46,471 --> 00:48:47,311
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll talk to them.

596
00:48:47,692 --> 00:48:51,054
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll do our level best to resolve any issue.

597
00:48:52,695 --> 00:48:53,775
[SPEAKER_15]: So my hope is this.

598
00:48:54,616 --> 00:49:07,264
[SPEAKER_15]: My hope is that with the leadership of the fire department, that we can reach out to those three firefighters, that they can go to Mr. Osborne's office tomorrow and see what needs to be done right now so we can get that clock

599
00:49:07,884 --> 00:49:08,745
[SPEAKER_15]: that clock ticking.

600
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:24,394
[SPEAKER_15]: But I will tell you Mr Osborne and I can I can have I can share some contacts with you with G. I see that there is a possibility when situations like this arise that you can call them and they can't support you within days that I know we've dealt with it.

601
00:49:24,775 --> 00:49:29,758
[SPEAKER_15]: So what I find more alarming to me is that we don't have a system

602
00:49:30,578 --> 00:49:42,107
[SPEAKER_15]: in our HR department that this isn't a natural onboarding system where they come in, fill out the paperwork, do the GIC stuff together, and that happens.

603
00:49:42,127 --> 00:49:49,692
[SPEAKER_15]: That's more alarming to me than anything because this wouldn't have happened if we didn't have a competent system in place like other communities.

604
00:49:49,712 --> 00:49:50,433
[SPEAKER_15]: This isn't odd.

605
00:49:50,513 --> 00:49:51,113
[SPEAKER_15]: This isn't new.

606
00:49:51,934 --> 00:50:04,758
[SPEAKER_15]: This is, private entities, as they come in, if you work with a private entity and you walked in and you sat down with the HR directors of that company, that's part of the onboarding system of acquiring healthcare.

607
00:50:05,058 --> 00:50:09,539
[SPEAKER_15]: That's probably one of the, after the salary, that's probably the most important thing you're looking at.

608
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:15,881
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that that's what I'm more alarmed right now is that we don't have that process in place.

609
00:50:16,281 --> 00:50:20,202
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I heard what you said, and what's alarming to me is that you're saying

610
00:50:21,641 --> 00:50:35,153
[SPEAKER_15]: let the people that we're hiring, who, by the way, we're having a very difficult time finding people to work in Medford, that they have to come and search for you so they can get the benefits that they are required to have.

611
00:50:35,814 --> 00:50:37,415
[SPEAKER_15]: Because every city employee

612
00:50:38,676 --> 00:50:40,799
[SPEAKER_15]: is required to the option of GIC.

613
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:41,881
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't know.

614
00:50:41,901 --> 00:50:48,410
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to get in between what was said here, what was said there.

615
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:49,271
[SPEAKER_15]: I really don't.

616
00:50:49,292 --> 00:50:51,174
[SPEAKER_15]: What I want is these three firefighters

617
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,685
[SPEAKER_15]: to get their insurance as quickly as possible.

618
00:50:55,426 --> 00:51:08,858
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you'd like to, I'll share that tomorrow with the information that I can get to you, that there's contacts at GIC that I've worked with directly that can help with onboarding special situations, like seems to be this one.

619
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:12,402
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is, from what I gather, I'm not confused.

620
00:51:13,715 --> 00:51:24,999
[SPEAKER_15]: From what I was told, Mr. Osborne, is that all three firefighters that are having issues all wanted the GIC and the city's insurance, correct?

621
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:27,260
[SPEAKER_13]: All of them have been to HI.

622
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:31,001
[SPEAKER_13]: All of them have communicated to the union multiple times.

623
00:51:31,602 --> 00:51:35,043
[SPEAKER_13]: We were never told, come in right now, we'll get you signed up.

624
00:51:35,683 --> 00:51:37,744
[SPEAKER_13]: They were told, go get your own insurance.

625
00:51:39,318 --> 00:51:40,258
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll reimburse you.

626
00:51:40,278 --> 00:51:53,963
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so for today, what I would love to do is get these three firefighters there tomorrow with our benefits officer and our HR director, and let's get the clock started tomorrow.

627
00:51:54,323 --> 00:51:55,523
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's get them get their insurance.

628
00:51:55,843 --> 00:52:00,325
[SPEAKER_15]: And moving forward, we need to figure out what we want.

629
00:52:00,905 --> 00:52:03,506
[SPEAKER_13]: So the chair, excuse me, but for decades,

630
00:52:04,315 --> 00:52:08,559
[SPEAKER_13]: You came in, you swore in, you signed up for your health insurance, and then you went home.

631
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,842
[SPEAKER_13]: You weren't allowed to go home unless you signed up.

632
00:52:11,522 --> 00:52:12,664
[SPEAKER_13]: So that was common practice.

633
00:52:12,684 --> 00:52:14,486
[SPEAKER_13]: So that changed a couple years ago.

634
00:52:16,223 --> 00:52:21,466
[SPEAKER_13]: Now again, when you go into HR, you expect help, especially from the HR coordinator.

635
00:52:21,927 --> 00:52:26,830
[SPEAKER_13]: If he says his secretary's not here and I can't help you, come back next week, that's not a great answer.

636
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:28,491
[SPEAKER_13]: And he's calling me a liar.

637
00:52:28,511 --> 00:52:30,832
[SPEAKER_13]: I have an email from right here.

638
00:52:31,452 --> 00:52:34,975
[SPEAKER_13]: Despite our efforts to encourage them to make an appointment to meet with us,

639
00:52:36,061 --> 00:52:42,224
[SPEAKER_13]: about health coverage needs, we have not heard from either Firefighter Borelli or Firefighter Dominique.

640
00:52:42,705 --> 00:52:51,849
[SPEAKER_13]: I just told you of three different times that Borelli went to HR and Neil himself told him, can't help you, secretary's nodding, come back.

641
00:52:54,991 --> 00:52:56,172
[SPEAKER_13]: Didn't mistake that one.

642
00:52:57,633 --> 00:52:58,873
[SPEAKER_13]: Those are your words, not mine.

643
00:53:00,514 --> 00:53:03,636
[SPEAKER_13]: The fact that these guys are still over a year and a half now,

644
00:53:05,197 --> 00:53:05,858
[SPEAKER_13]: They won't have coverage.

645
00:53:05,898 --> 00:53:07,999
[SPEAKER_13]: If they get it today, they won't have coverage till July.

646
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:10,320
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll be out a year and a half of insurance.

647
00:53:12,842 --> 00:53:13,663
[SPEAKER_13]: It's unacceptable.

648
00:53:14,663 --> 00:53:15,664
[SPEAKER_13]: Our members deserve better.

649
00:53:16,444 --> 00:53:17,485
[SPEAKER_13]: The city deserves better.

650
00:53:19,466 --> 00:53:23,029
[SPEAKER_13]: There should be some kind of proof of insurance when you get hired by the city.

651
00:53:23,309 --> 00:53:26,711
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're not going to take their insurance, you need to prove that you have insurance.

652
00:53:28,192 --> 00:53:30,253
[SPEAKER_13]: The state requires it when you file your taxes.

653
00:53:30,994 --> 00:53:32,315
[SPEAKER_13]: The city doesn't require it when you

654
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:38,455
[SPEAKER_13]: when you join their health coverage or you opt out of it, they require it.

655
00:53:39,296 --> 00:53:43,179
[SPEAKER_13]: In order to go for, if you guys know, in the GIC, there's an opt out.

656
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:49,204
[SPEAKER_13]: We get a benefit of $2,000 for a single, $4,000 for a family.

657
00:53:49,985 --> 00:53:54,368
[SPEAKER_13]: If you wanna opt out of the insurance, you have to prove that you have insurance.

658
00:53:55,749 --> 00:53:59,392
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you get hired, you don't have to prove that you're insurance if you don't want it.

659
00:53:59,953 --> 00:54:01,654
[SPEAKER_13]: So they only care when it costs them money.

660
00:54:01,934 --> 00:54:02,615
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to prove it.

661
00:54:03,936 --> 00:54:18,731
[SPEAKER_15]: That tells you the city doesn't care about us, but they only care about money, this, it's a little confused because I know that as as a negotiator on when we were as a teacher, and we negotiate we're one of the first, I believe back in the days, we were on the negotiating team when we were

662
00:54:20,029 --> 00:54:22,650
[SPEAKER_15]: picking the government insurance process.

663
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:29,154
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know that we, that's one of the things with the teachers onboarding system that's done right away.

664
00:54:29,234 --> 00:54:39,740
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that that's something this council, I would make an emotion that we ask that we see the onboarding system that's used in practice today.

665
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:49,822
[SPEAKER_15]: and our HR department and then review to see how we can correct these issues so we don't have people or families without insurance without knowing.

666
00:54:49,902 --> 00:54:52,443
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that'd be important.

667
00:54:52,463 --> 00:54:53,763
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd make that as a form of motion.

668
00:54:54,404 --> 00:54:58,625
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I'd also make a form of motion that requests that

669
00:55:00,285 --> 00:55:14,275
[SPEAKER_15]: that HR director reach out to these three firefighters directly and call for an emergency meeting with them ASAP so we can get that clock started so they're insured through the city as soon as possible.

670
00:55:14,355 --> 00:55:19,399
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, I don't, I don't, personally, I don't, it's not hearsay.

671
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,301
[SPEAKER_15]: I've worked with the GIC often.

672
00:55:24,175 --> 00:55:25,956
[SPEAKER_15]: This is not a year-long process.

673
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:38,161
[SPEAKER_15]: This is if you go through different benefits departments, they have charts that are set up that shows you if you're hired, and these dates, these are the dates that you'll be on board.

674
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:39,522
[SPEAKER_15]: They're given, they're,

675
00:55:40,322 --> 00:55:44,744
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not going to share with you, but this is one communities that they share with the person that's hired.

676
00:55:45,484 --> 00:55:45,925
[SPEAKER_15]: This is it.

677
00:55:46,245 --> 00:55:46,925
[SPEAKER_15]: This is your date.

678
00:55:47,405 --> 00:55:48,326
[SPEAKER_15]: You're hired in this date.

679
00:55:48,526 --> 00:55:50,547
[SPEAKER_15]: Expect to have your G. I. C. On this date.

680
00:55:51,007 --> 00:55:55,489
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's something we need to correct on the city side to make sure this doesn't happen again.

681
00:55:55,569 --> 00:56:01,492
[SPEAKER_15]: So, um, again, this is this is alarming, but I think it's something we need to correct as soon as possible.

682
00:56:01,532 --> 00:56:04,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Madam President, any further discussion from counselors?

683
00:56:06,514 --> 00:56:08,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other members of the public would like to speak?

684
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,540
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to speak if I may.

685
00:56:10,641 --> 00:56:12,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, name and address for the record, please.

686
00:56:12,021 --> 00:56:12,801
[SPEAKER_11]: Paul Jones, 5 St.

687
00:56:12,842 --> 00:56:14,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Mary Street, treasurer of the union.

688
00:56:16,343 --> 00:56:20,385
[SPEAKER_11]: At first, I'd like to say that I'm embarrassed that we're here for this issue.

689
00:56:20,885 --> 00:56:30,189
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a basic employee function, basic employee benefits that should be able to be taken care of routinely on an everyday fashion.

690
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:37,993
[SPEAKER_11]: Through the chair, Mr. Osborne, how many times have I been to your office regarding this issue with these firefighters?

691
00:56:40,643 --> 00:56:41,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Osborne, would you like to answer that?

692
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:44,912
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't have an answer for that.

693
00:56:46,058 --> 00:56:46,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

694
00:56:46,638 --> 00:56:48,739
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll tell you a minimum of six times.

695
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:50,159
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize.

696
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:52,240
[SPEAKER_11]: I did not document the times and dates.

697
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,840
[SPEAKER_11]: The last time I was there, we spoke to Candace.

698
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,501
[SPEAKER_11]: You were in a Zoom meeting.

699
00:56:56,741 --> 00:56:59,381
[SPEAKER_11]: I asked for her to have you give me a call back.

700
00:56:59,441 --> 00:57:00,562
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm still waiting for the call.

701
00:57:01,582 --> 00:57:04,803
[SPEAKER_11]: These firefighters have been to your office numerous times.

702
00:57:05,143 --> 00:57:09,964
[SPEAKER_11]: There were no misstatements by President Buckley because I was present for most of these meetings.

703
00:57:10,424 --> 00:57:13,965
[SPEAKER_11]: We have discussed this, as you requested, multiple times.

704
00:57:15,492 --> 00:57:19,233
[SPEAKER_11]: So for us to have to go there again, we'll do it one more time.

705
00:57:19,373 --> 00:57:20,353
[SPEAKER_11]: We'll be there tomorrow.

706
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:22,633
[SPEAKER_11]: You name a time.

707
00:57:23,533 --> 00:57:30,535
[SPEAKER_11]: And when we leave your office tomorrow, these three firefighters will have insurance through the GIC, whether you do it or I have to do it myself.

708
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:34,175
[SPEAKER_11]: I request the paperwork that the GIC requires to sign them up.

709
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:40,256
[SPEAKER_11]: So let me rephrase the question, Mr. Osborne.

710
00:57:40,296 --> 00:57:44,097
[SPEAKER_11]: Have I been to your office regarding this issue with these firefighters?

711
00:57:45,188 --> 00:57:46,729
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is an interrogation.

712
00:57:46,749 --> 00:57:50,132
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand your approach, but Mr Osborne, it's not interrogation.

713
00:57:50,172 --> 00:57:50,812
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a question.

714
00:57:51,793 --> 00:57:53,714
[SPEAKER_11]: It's happening.

715
00:57:53,894 --> 00:57:54,955
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand that it's through the chair.

716
00:57:54,975 --> 00:57:56,356
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the chair through the chair.

717
00:57:56,456 --> 00:57:59,879
[SPEAKER_11]: He's saying that President Buckley has made misstatements.

718
00:58:00,479 --> 00:58:01,920
[SPEAKER_11]: I was present for these events.

719
00:58:02,761 --> 00:58:03,702
[SPEAKER_11]: They're not misstatements.

720
00:58:05,083 --> 00:58:05,183
[SPEAKER_11]: It's

721
00:58:07,745 --> 00:58:09,866
[SPEAKER_11]: I would just like for these firefighters to have insurance.

722
00:58:10,346 --> 00:58:13,087
[SPEAKER_11]: There are other employees, police, DPW.

723
00:58:13,587 --> 00:58:17,128
[SPEAKER_11]: This is not an issue that's specific to the fire department.

724
00:58:17,428 --> 00:58:19,069
[SPEAKER_11]: It's specific to all city employees.

725
00:58:20,529 --> 00:58:21,909
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd love to get these people covered.

726
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:31,973
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we were never told about a GIC exclusionary 60 day wait period, we've always been told, fill out the paperwork, we're working on it, we will get back to you.

727
00:58:33,573 --> 00:58:36,154
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was a misstatement by Mr. Osborne.

728
00:58:37,352 --> 00:58:42,299
[SPEAKER_11]: I will see you in your office tomorrow now with these three firefighters looking forward to it.

729
00:58:42,539 --> 00:58:43,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Probably about 10 o'clock.

730
00:58:43,761 --> 00:58:44,341
[SPEAKER_11]: How's that sound?

731
00:58:45,743 --> 00:58:46,064
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

732
00:58:46,484 --> 00:58:48,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Madam President.

733
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,790
[SPEAKER_15]: I can just just final question.

734
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:50,890
[SPEAKER_15]: Um,

735
00:58:53,294 --> 00:59:04,641
[SPEAKER_15]: I have those motions in place, but if Mr. Osborne can answer, are we having similar issues with fire and DPW as well, and other departments?

736
00:59:04,661 --> 00:59:05,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you mean police and DPW?

737
00:59:05,581 --> 00:59:10,744
[SPEAKER_15]: Police, excuse me, police and DPW, any other departments that, so we can correct that as well.

738
00:59:10,904 --> 00:59:12,005
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Osborne, can you speak to that?

739
00:59:13,065 --> 00:59:18,208
[SPEAKER_21]: No employee that's met with us has informed me that they are without insurance.

740
00:59:18,228 --> 00:59:19,569
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, thank you.

741
00:59:19,869 --> 00:59:20,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

742
00:59:23,191 --> 00:59:25,453
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other members of the public wishes?

743
00:59:25,553 --> 00:59:26,373
[SPEAKER_11]: One more thing on that.

744
00:59:26,454 --> 00:59:29,576
[SPEAKER_11]: I have spoken to many people that say they have no insurance.

745
00:59:30,457 --> 00:59:33,239
[SPEAKER_11]: They've been signed up to the connector to the mayor's office.

746
00:59:33,939 --> 00:59:38,963
[SPEAKER_11]: They've been told to bring their bills to City Hall to pay the bills, which I guess is be self insured.

747
00:59:39,584 --> 00:59:40,885
[SPEAKER_11]: They were told to go on Cobra.

748
00:59:41,185 --> 00:59:42,886
[SPEAKER_11]: They were told to go on their parents insurance.

749
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:45,728
[SPEAKER_11]: They were told to do anything but sign up for the gig.

750
00:59:46,469 --> 00:59:47,390
[SPEAKER_11]: If it's a gig issue,

751
00:59:48,564 --> 00:59:54,748
[SPEAKER_11]: We would have liked to known that back in July, not today, but we will take care of this one way or the other.

752
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:56,049
[SPEAKER_11]: I appreciate your time.

753
00:59:56,710 --> 01:00:03,254
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, I'm sorry to have to spend it on this issue, which shouldn't have to be rise to this level.

754
01:00:03,995 --> 01:00:04,315
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

755
01:00:04,575 --> 01:00:04,856
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

01:00:06,377 --> 01:00:12,721

[SPEAKER_05]: Six in the affirmative zero in the negative one briefly absent.

889
01:02:14,659 --> 01:02:19,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to hand it over to vice president bears for a summary of the paper before us.

890
01:02:20,745 --> 01:02:22,606
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Madam President.

891
01:02:24,686 --> 01:02:33,609
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a quick summary this is we've discussed this many times now over the past three years and committee and subcommittee This is a proposal to create an affordable housing trust for the city of Medford.

892
01:02:34,109 --> 01:02:37,890
[SPEAKER_06]: This would create a trust of the provisions of state law where

893
01:02:39,477 --> 01:02:47,361
[SPEAKER_06]: City funds private funds etc could be pulled for the benefit of creating more affordable housing in the community.

894
01:02:49,082 --> 01:02:52,244
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been reported out of committee, just the latest updates.

895
01:02:55,410 --> 01:03:00,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion when this is reported on a committee in November was to request comments from Greater Boston Building Trades.

896
01:03:00,633 --> 01:03:06,076
[SPEAKER_06]: They have submitted a letter of comment through the Greater Boston Labor Council, which was included in our packets last week.

897
01:03:07,997 --> 01:03:14,581
[SPEAKER_06]: I also have distributed a short, there's two minor technical amendments that need to be made here.

898
01:03:14,621 --> 01:03:23,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I just caught a couple of typos when I was reading through the, well, caught a couple of typos and a couple of typos were brought to my attention looking through the ordinance on the agenda.

899
01:03:25,094 --> 01:03:27,862
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm happy to present them, but there's one in section 49-52, which the

900
01:03:32,668 --> 01:03:35,050
[SPEAKER_06]: Number four should be replaced with the remaining members.

901
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:39,193
[SPEAKER_06]: It says the board shall be composed of seven members, but then it says one shall be the mayor.

902
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:41,594
[SPEAKER_06]: One may be a member of the Community Preservation Committee.

903
01:03:41,614 --> 01:03:48,759
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it says four, that would only add up to six or maybe even five if the may of the Community Preservation Committee members considered.

904
01:03:48,839 --> 01:03:55,664
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just proposed a technical amendment to strike the number four and replace it with the words, the remaining members.

905
01:03:57,355 --> 01:04:00,980
[SPEAKER_06]: And then in section 49-54, subsection 11, just clarifying language here.

906
01:04:07,506 --> 01:04:21,210
[SPEAKER_06]: that we had put into the ordinance, just to explain that borrowed by the trust shall pledge any borrowing that pledges more than 70% of the cash assets of the trust for Park City Council approvals.

907
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:24,191
[SPEAKER_06]: It was just a little bit confusing there.

908
01:04:24,251 --> 01:04:26,972
[SPEAKER_06]: And I talked that over with planning development and sustainability.

909
01:04:27,552 --> 01:04:31,073
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would move to amend

910
01:04:33,137 --> 01:04:39,102
[SPEAKER_06]: the ordinance to reflect those two technical amendments, which all counselors should have and the clerk should have.

911
01:04:40,924 --> 01:04:54,436
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would also move to attach the letter of comment received from the Greater Boston Labor Council and require the trustees to incorporate the language provided by the Greater Boston Labor Council into the rules and regulations of the Affordable Housing Trust.

912
01:04:55,637 --> 01:05:00,101
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that would be the language that we received back regarding project labor agreements.

913
01:05:02,163 --> 01:05:04,887
[SPEAKER_05]: for those folks at home who do not have this in front of them.

914
01:05:04,927 --> 01:05:10,015
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you please read the amended language for section 49-5411 just so sure it was read.

915
01:05:16,909 --> 01:05:19,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's just, it's like a conjugation change and insertion of one word.

916
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:29,454
[SPEAKER_06]: It clearly reads any borrowing by the trust that pledges, any borrowing by the trust pledging more than 75, 70% of the assets of the trust requires city council approval.

917
01:05:29,934 --> 01:05:36,917
[SPEAKER_06]: The change would be any borrowing by the trust that pledges more than 70% of the cash assets of the trust requires city council approval.

918
01:05:37,457 --> 01:05:38,498
[SPEAKER_05]: Great, thank you.

919
01:05:40,999 --> 01:05:43,740
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have those two amendments by,

920
01:05:45,649 --> 01:05:46,569
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President of Affairs.

921
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:49,671
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would propose those amendments and to approve the ordinance for first reading.

922
01:05:50,631 --> 01:05:51,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to sever.

923
01:05:51,892 --> 01:05:55,373
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Councilor Knight.

924
01:05:56,134 --> 01:05:57,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to sever the amendments.

925
01:05:57,654 --> 01:06:00,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, motion to sever the amendments.

926
01:06:02,837 --> 01:06:05,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Take the amendments completely separate or just separate from all yet?

927
01:06:06,458 --> 01:06:07,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Separate.

928
01:06:07,899 --> 01:06:08,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one by one.

929
01:06:08,479 --> 01:06:10,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's fine.

930
01:06:14,594 --> 01:06:15,474
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have those before us.

931
01:06:15,494 --> 01:06:17,555
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there's a number of members of the public who would like to speak.

932
01:06:17,575 --> 01:06:19,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Any councilors who would like to speak at this time?

933
01:06:21,937 --> 01:06:23,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins and then Councilor Osanic.

934
01:06:25,318 --> 01:06:38,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you, Vice President Bears for continuing to work with council leadership and city staff to get this ordinance into the version that we're voting on for first reading.

935
01:06:38,962 --> 01:06:44,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight, another many years of hard work has gone into this ordinance predating my tenure on this council.

936
01:06:45,966 --> 01:06:48,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's about time in many ways.

937
01:06:48,627 --> 01:06:56,852
[SPEAKER_04]: This has been a work product spread out over many years with input from many local and regional housing experts.

938
01:06:57,052 --> 01:07:03,636
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's most important to me is that there is a incredibly demonstrated need for

939
01:07:04,704 --> 01:07:12,989
[SPEAKER_04]: affordable housing in Medford and mechanisms for creating affordable housing in Medford and repositories for funding for affordable housing in Medford.

940
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:20,833
[SPEAKER_04]: There's already a discrepancy between the people who are eligible for affordable or subsidized housing and how much of that type of housing that we already have.

941
01:07:21,434 --> 01:07:27,017
[SPEAKER_04]: So in a lot of ways, creating an affordable housing trust is really just a preliminary step, but it's one I'm glad we're finally taking.

942
01:07:27,197 --> 01:07:27,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

943
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:30,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

944
01:07:30,139 --> 01:07:30,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Sack.

945
01:07:31,118 --> 01:07:32,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Morell.

946
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:41,891
[SPEAKER_07]: This, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund is something that experts and residents have been working on and clamoring for for a very long time in our city.

947
01:07:42,812 --> 01:07:44,894
[SPEAKER_07]: I've, especially in the last few weeks.

948
01:07:46,596 --> 01:07:59,366
[SPEAKER_07]: There's been a lot of pressure on us rightfully so to get this done and dusted, and this ordinance, you know, has has been in the works for many years as Councilor Collins has stated.

949
01:08:00,807 --> 01:08:03,089
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's finally time to do something about it.

950
01:08:03,469 --> 01:08:08,533
[SPEAKER_07]: I think when we think about the crises that are immediate to our, to our city.

951
01:08:09,534 --> 01:08:21,223
[SPEAKER_07]: There are many, but housing is first and foremost for many if not for many residents and it touches many if not all of our residents here as a young person who wants to stay in Medford.

952
01:08:22,744 --> 01:08:34,152
[SPEAKER_07]: This is, you know, the type of action that we need to see our city government investing in doing to make sure that young folks can stay in Medford to make sure that people who want to buy houses can buy houses.

953
01:08:35,513 --> 01:08:39,796
[SPEAKER_07]: and to really tackle the regional housing crisis challenge.

954
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:42,458
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm happy to support this.

955
01:08:42,898 --> 01:08:56,287
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm glad that we were able to iron out a lot of the details, and while I think, and we said this last week about the ordinances that we passed last week, you know, there are going to be small things that people want to see changed.

956
01:08:57,548 --> 01:08:58,569
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this represents

957
01:08:59,369 --> 01:09:15,959
[SPEAKER_07]: us as a council, listening to the experts, listening to the unions, listening to our stakeholders in this project, really giving them time to work out the kinks and the details, and coming back with a product that I think we can be proud of.

958
01:09:16,599 --> 01:09:17,299
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

959
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:17,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

960
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam President, thank you very much.

961
01:09:20,441 --> 01:09:23,563
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I'd like to withdraw my motion to seven amendments.

962
01:09:24,355 --> 01:09:28,522
[SPEAKER_02]: And second Council business motion to approve the first reading.

963
01:09:29,824 --> 01:09:33,591
[SPEAKER_02]: After taking a how to look at the amendments that he's made I don't see any reason to seven.

964
01:09:34,555 --> 01:09:42,021
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that I think we need to also thank our friend john Falco for because Council Falco was the person that kicked this off.

965
01:09:42,481 --> 01:09:50,967
[SPEAKER_02]: And this wouldn't have gotten as far as it had if it weren't for john's diligence and john's work on this particular issue when he served as a member of the city council.

966
01:09:51,607 --> 01:09:55,130
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, Madam President, I support the paper and I thank the gentleman for his amendments.

967
01:09:56,448 --> 01:09:57,109
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

968
01:09:57,789 --> 01:09:58,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Kerrio.

969
01:09:58,670 --> 01:09:59,511
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Madam President.

970
01:09:59,892 --> 01:10:10,282
[SPEAKER_14]: As I hear from people and I hear from businesses that want to locate into Metro, one of the concerns is if we're going to have enough housing for their employees as they move here.

971
01:10:10,763 --> 01:10:19,712
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would hope that this ordinance will help alleviate some of those things and hopefully drive some more housing into our market.

972
01:10:20,848 --> 01:10:21,648
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

973
01:10:22,068 --> 01:10:22,728
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to Councilor Tseng.

974
01:10:23,229 --> 01:10:29,170
[SPEAKER_07]: I think Councilor Caraviello makes a great point there that pro-housing policies are pro-business and pro-growth as well.

975
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:33,771
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we wanna see a more vibrant economy, this is the type of stuff we need to be doing.

976
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:37,272
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that's a great point and I just wanted to reinforce it.

977
01:10:38,272 --> 01:10:38,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

978
01:10:39,493 --> 01:10:40,053
[SPEAKER_05]: President Bares.

979
01:10:40,373 --> 01:10:41,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

980
01:10:41,273 --> 01:10:47,975
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanna second what Councilor Knight said and thanks to former Councilor Falco for advancing this.

981
01:10:48,255 --> 01:10:48,955
[SPEAKER_06]: When it was first,

982
01:10:50,242 --> 01:10:56,249
[SPEAKER_06]: On the agenda and I saw my name next to I said that doesn't seem right I don't think I proposed this in January 2020 but that's because counselor talk with it.

983
01:10:56,489 --> 01:10:57,109
[SPEAKER_06]: So, thank you.

984
01:10:58,391 --> 01:11:08,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I just, I also want to, I mean, thanks to everyone who worked on this and the council for their support and the many folks who lended their voices to shaping this.

985
01:11:09,528 --> 01:11:12,770
[SPEAKER_05]: all in City Hall, outside of City Hall, residents, unions, everyone.

986
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:20,055
[SPEAKER_05]: And I agree that I think actually two recent papers, this paper and the housing civilian notification ordinance were brought to this Council by Councilor Falco.

987
01:11:20,095 --> 01:11:23,438
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope he's happy that we are finally finishing some of this work.

988
01:11:24,278 --> 01:11:28,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we do have some members of the public who would like to speak both on Zoom and in person.

989
01:11:28,421 --> 01:11:33,105
[SPEAKER_05]: I do see one hand up from Matthew Page Lieberman.

990
01:11:34,926 --> 01:11:36,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please.

991
01:11:38,422 --> 01:11:41,223
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I just want to say, though, that Councilor Knight's hand is still up.

992
01:11:41,543 --> 01:11:42,483
[SPEAKER_12]: Does he need to speak?

993
01:11:42,643 --> 01:11:43,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it is.

994
01:11:43,363 --> 01:11:44,824
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe it's remaining up.

995
01:11:44,924 --> 01:11:48,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight, tell me if I'm wrong, but I think your hand is just still up.

996
01:11:48,145 --> 01:11:49,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do you have something else you'd like to add?

997
01:11:52,606 --> 01:11:53,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't encourage me, Councilor.

998
01:11:55,327 --> 01:11:56,287
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

999
01:11:56,307 --> 01:11:57,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1000
01:11:57,908 --> 01:11:58,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Back to you, Matthew.

1001
01:11:59,122 --> 01:12:01,925
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, well, it remains to be up the vestigial hand.

1002
01:12:02,466 --> 01:12:04,328
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so I mean, this is extremely exciting.

1003
01:12:04,368 --> 01:12:06,630
[SPEAKER_12]: I know people have been working on for a long time.

1004
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:12,276
[SPEAKER_12]: I also believe that, you know, Roberta Cameron played a major role in this, getting this off the ground some years ago.

1005
01:12:12,296 --> 01:12:15,780
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's really, really exciting that's finally getting the vote.

1006
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:21,285
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know it's been kind of taken a few months, it seems like there was a little bit of deferring.

1007
01:12:21,926 --> 01:12:25,488
[SPEAKER_12]: to a union to figure out to get their take on the language and stuff like that.

1008
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:35,074
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, you know, as of Friday, you know, somebody like me, I'm finally able to see the public copy and the preference for I guess what is the project work agreement.

1009
01:12:35,854 --> 01:12:38,636
[SPEAKER_12]: It's something that I do not have, I do not have a problem with.

1010
01:12:39,637 --> 01:12:44,202
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, I was not able to attend the committee committee the whole meeting in November.

1011
01:12:44,642 --> 01:12:52,471
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, just based on reading the minutes of that and seeing, you know, this final or prior to the next amendments that we voted on.

1012
01:12:53,396 --> 01:13:13,975
[SPEAKER_12]: I just kind of noticed that I think when we're, if we're kind of seeing, you know, unions and like high paying jobs as a way of addressing, you know, economic injustice, especially here, like in the greater Boston area, if I mean, if we're going to value the unions and understand the role that, you know, unions have played in the history of this country, moving, you know, people doing working class in a middle class,

1013
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,236
[SPEAKER_12]: building the middle class in this country.

1014
01:13:17,177 --> 01:13:24,441
[SPEAKER_12]: It's also important to kind of consider that that's not the only part of the picture when we talk about addressing economic injustice.

1015
01:13:25,221 --> 01:13:42,392
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, for instance, you know, a report came out, it's kind of, it's a little, it's a famous report, some people criticize the numbers and they're trying to reevaluate that, you know, a report came out from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, which was also conducted by Duke University, and I guess the New School, I'm not quite sure,

1016
01:13:43,332 --> 01:13:49,096
[SPEAKER_12]: about in 2015 that the average white household wealth for greater Boston is $247.5 thousand.

1017
01:13:49,116 --> 01:13:50,537
[SPEAKER_12]: The average median household wealth for U.S.

1018
01:13:50,577 --> 01:13:52,498
[SPEAKER_12]: born black people in Boston is eight dollars.

1019
01:14:00,823 --> 01:14:23,835
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think these kinds of things are things that we should also kind of consider when we're talking about we're thinking about how we're going to address income in wealth injustice in our housing plans and so you know one of the things that would have been nice to add as a preference is to make sure that these kinds of contracts are going out to working class people of color or that we'll be contracting perhaps we could do this in the guidelines

1020
01:14:24,375 --> 01:14:31,580
[SPEAKER_12]: contractors that will have some kind of pledge to make sure that they are hiring people that for centuries have been cut out of economic opportunities.

1021
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:41,407
[SPEAKER_12]: And especially in the municipal level, we have a lot of power as far as whose contracts we can provide to, who we can kind of help out out of situations like $8 an hour in the whole household wealth.

1022
01:14:42,028 --> 01:14:52,115
[SPEAKER_12]: Another option, another thing though, is I think it would be nice if we also had just a preference for contracting with non-profit housing developers and community development corporations

1023
01:14:52,555 --> 01:14:55,477
[SPEAKER_12]: That's just something to think about in the future as we go into guidelines.

1024
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:57,438
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not calling for any of those amendments at all.

1025
01:14:57,638 --> 01:15:06,724
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm extremely, extremely happy this is finally going to get a vote, but I'm just thinking perhaps in the future as we move forward, we can make sure to include those concerns in these guidelines.

1026
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:07,764
[SPEAKER_12]: And thank you very much.

1027
01:15:07,804 --> 01:15:09,245
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope everybody's going to vote for this.

1028
01:15:10,866 --> 01:15:11,226
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1029
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to Penny, name and address for the record, please.

1030
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:19,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Oops, sorry, I need to unmute you.

1031
01:15:19,391 --> 01:15:19,952
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, apologies.

1032
01:15:21,633 --> 01:15:21,913
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.

1033
01:15:23,254 --> 01:15:24,597
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, thanks.

1034
01:15:24,938 --> 01:15:27,303
[SPEAKER_01]: Penny Taylor 29 Martin Street in Medford.

1035
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:34,098
[SPEAKER_01]: I work as a housing advocate in the city of Somerville and have been organizing against displacement in this area for the past decade.

1036
01:15:34,659 --> 01:15:40,002
[SPEAKER_01]: In Somerville, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund is a meaningful tool to impact the housing needs of residents.

1037
01:15:40,542 --> 01:15:41,823
[SPEAKER_01]: The flexibility is key.

1038
01:15:41,943 --> 01:15:48,947
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows creative solutions to the complicated and varying problems people are facing in our housing crisis.

1039
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:53,489
[SPEAKER_01]: And this type of fund allows for clear material advantages for residents.

1040
01:15:54,062 --> 01:16:03,212
[SPEAKER_01]: especially those who have the most barriers to reaching other forms of support and housing stability alongside benefiting truly all residents, renters and owners alike.

1041
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:06,735
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited to see it happening here in Medford and hope you all approve it.

1042
01:16:06,755 --> 01:16:07,296
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

1043
01:16:07,316 --> 01:16:09,098
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1044
01:16:11,057 --> 01:16:12,158
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll go to one person.

1045
01:16:12,938 --> 01:16:14,099
[SPEAKER_05]: Will, name and address for the record, please.

1046
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:18,684
[SPEAKER_16]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1047
01:16:19,724 --> 01:16:22,047
[SPEAKER_16]: I just want to say that I think this is a good ordinance.

1048
01:16:22,487 --> 01:16:23,368
[SPEAKER_16]: You should pass it.

1049
01:16:24,209 --> 01:16:28,132
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm pleased to see that there's a lot of support of the council for it.

1050
01:16:29,593 --> 01:16:32,996
[SPEAKER_16]: I also just want to say that a lot of work went in to

1051
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:41,664
[SPEAKER_16]: know, reaching a, you know, pro-labor, pro-union version of this ordinance.

1052
01:16:42,425 --> 01:16:47,208
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it's important that we recognize that and how we were able to do that.

1053
01:16:47,748 --> 01:16:48,729
[SPEAKER_16]: The Council was able to do that.

1054
01:16:48,749 --> 01:16:50,831
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the Vice President took the lead on that.

1055
01:16:51,871 --> 01:16:54,113
[SPEAKER_16]: And I want to thank him and the Council for doing that.

1056
01:16:57,256 --> 01:17:01,599
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think Councilor Knight also pushed for that very strongly.

1057
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:10,245
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it's very important that we recognize that as we try to build more housing in the city, there are going to be workers who do that.

1058
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:16,189
[SPEAKER_16]: And the workers movement, the union movement is going to be a part of the pro-housing movement.

1059
01:17:16,330 --> 01:17:16,930
[SPEAKER_16]: It needs to be.

1060
01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:23,354
[SPEAKER_16]: And so I'm glad that everybody was able to come to a really workable solution.

1061
01:17:24,595 --> 01:17:24,955
[SPEAKER_16]: on that.

1062
01:17:25,456 --> 01:17:26,537
[SPEAKER_16]: I know it took some time.

1063
01:17:27,978 --> 01:17:34,262
[SPEAKER_16]: Everybody would love negotiations and discussions and so I had to go quicker, but it takes time.

1064
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:39,686
[SPEAKER_16]: And well, we got to this point and that's really great.

1065
01:17:40,006 --> 01:17:43,589
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm excited that this ordinance seems like it's going to pass.

1066
01:17:43,649 --> 01:17:44,009
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1067
01:17:44,509 --> 01:17:44,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1068
01:17:45,951 --> 01:17:48,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to Alex on Zoom.

1069
01:17:48,512 --> 01:17:50,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Alex name and address for the record, please.

1070
01:17:51,479 --> 01:17:54,221
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is Alex Lessenhop, 30 Wright Ave.

1071
01:17:54,421 --> 01:17:54,922
[SPEAKER_00]: in Medford.

1072
01:17:56,043 --> 01:18:03,149
[SPEAKER_00]: I have nothing of great, you know, import to say beyond what my fellow residents have already contributed.

1073
01:18:03,169 --> 01:18:08,573
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to add my voice to the chorus to say thank you to the Council for working on this.

1074
01:18:08,653 --> 01:18:09,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for bringing it forward.

1075
01:18:09,714 --> 01:18:12,116
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like there's support for it.

1076
01:18:12,216 --> 01:18:13,818
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really happy to see it finally get passed.

1077
01:18:14,518 --> 01:18:18,841
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with a volunteer residence group called Housing Medford.

1078
01:18:19,021 --> 01:18:23,984
[SPEAKER_00]: Passing this affordable housing trust has been one of our top priorities for the past couple of years.

1079
01:18:24,144 --> 01:18:30,048
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really, really excited to, if this indeed passes, to move it into the done column.

1080
01:18:30,449 --> 01:18:31,689
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you so much for your support.

1081
01:18:31,809 --> 01:18:32,690
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate it.

1082
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:36,052
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people of Medford, current and future residents, all thank you for it.

1083
01:18:36,072 --> 01:18:39,174
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1084
01:18:43,632 --> 01:18:44,733
[SPEAKER_20]: Name and address for the record, please.

1085
01:18:45,393 --> 01:18:47,594
[SPEAKER_20]: Roberta Cameron, 12 North Street.

1086
01:18:48,174 --> 01:18:50,055
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just have to come up.

1087
01:18:50,095 --> 01:19:02,742
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't have anything more to say that hasn't been said already this evening, but I'm really excited that we've all come this far in developing this ordinance to establish the Affordable Housing Trust.

1088
01:19:03,182 --> 01:19:08,364
[SPEAKER_20]: As was mentioned earlier, I've been working on this for years since we adopted the Community Preservation Act.

1089
01:19:08,725 --> 01:19:13,267
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been looking at an affordable housing trust as a tool that would be really helpful to

1090
01:19:13,847 --> 01:19:19,730
[SPEAKER_20]: be able to best use and amplify our Community Preservation Act funds to create affordable housing.

1091
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:36,979
[SPEAKER_20]: There's been a lot of concern about the details of exactly what we do with affordable housing trust funds, and I look forward to seeing what kinds of guidelines can be worked out in implementing the affordable housing trust that

1092
01:19:37,879 --> 01:19:49,883
[SPEAKER_20]: that adopts the preferences and goals of Medford while still centering the primary purpose of the Affordable Housing Trust to create affordable housing.

1093
01:19:50,444 --> 01:19:51,604
[SPEAKER_20]: So thank you very much.

1094
01:19:52,564 --> 01:19:55,225
[SPEAKER_20]: And I look forward to the next steps.

1095
01:19:55,745 --> 01:19:55,986
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks.

1096
01:19:56,266 --> 01:19:56,606
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1097
01:19:57,526 --> 01:20:00,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to PDS Director Alicia Hunt on Zoom.

1098
01:20:01,748 --> 01:20:02,448
[SPEAKER_05]: I will unmute you.

1099
01:20:06,249 --> 01:20:13,991
[SPEAKER_18]: Madam President and members of the council, we just wanted to thank you on behalf of our office and the administration for moving this forward.

1100
01:20:14,031 --> 01:20:22,193
[SPEAKER_18]: We've enjoyed working with you on this ordinance and we look forward, I'm here with Danielle Evans as well from our office.

1101
01:20:23,093 --> 01:20:28,234
[SPEAKER_18]: We look forward to seeing this passed and working on the implementation of this.

1102
01:20:28,774 --> 01:20:34,736
[SPEAKER_18]: If anybody's wondering about next steps, we're assuming that we will move forward the work

1103
01:20:37,369 --> 01:20:37,649
[SPEAKER_18]: very much.

1104
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:39,271
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1105
01:20:40,031 --> 01:20:43,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to Dan on zoom, name and address for the record, please.

1106
01:20:45,496 --> 01:20:47,658
[SPEAKER_23]: Daniel Craven 21 Maple Ave, Medford.

1107
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:55,605
[SPEAKER_23]: I just have a question on will these properties that are absorbed into this housing trust?

1108
01:20:55,745 --> 01:20:58,327
[SPEAKER_23]: Will they still pay property taxes to the city of Medford?

1109
01:21:01,038 --> 01:21:07,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, the properties that go through the housing trust, they'll still pay property taxes.

1110
01:21:07,762 --> 01:21:11,925
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's a complicated question.

1111
01:21:11,945 --> 01:21:13,546
[SPEAKER_06]: The housing trust can do a lot of things.

1112
01:21:13,606 --> 01:21:20,531
[SPEAKER_06]: If the housing trust funds a private project on private land, then that project would pay property taxes.

1113
01:21:21,772 --> 01:21:31,241
[SPEAKER_06]: The fund was, you know, there could be a complicated arrangement where perhaps the city is leasing public land to a private developer I believe that would also constitute paying property taxes.

1114
01:21:35,185 --> 01:21:53,099
[SPEAKER_06]: If the city were to say have a piece of land that's currently public land that currently doesn't pay property taxes, because the city would just be paying taxes to itself, and that were to be conveyed to the Affordable Housing Trust, it wouldn't start paying property taxes until it was conveyed to sold or something like that.

1115
01:21:53,239 --> 01:21:55,161
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know if that answers your question.

1116
01:21:55,741 --> 01:22:03,227
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not so simple as a yes or no answer, but if funding for this goes to private projects, then those would pay property taxes, absolutely.

1117
01:22:04,963 --> 01:22:05,304
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1118
01:22:06,286 --> 01:22:06,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1119
01:22:07,608 --> 01:22:11,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other members of the public wish to speak either on zoom or in person?

1120
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:25,022
[SPEAKER_09]: next to doing everything written on here, I don't know why.

1121
01:22:27,243 --> 01:22:28,363
[SPEAKER_22]: It's in my hand when I stood up.

1122
01:22:28,844 --> 01:22:31,325
[SPEAKER_22]: Mark Curtis, 89 Chain Craft Street in Medford.

1123
01:22:32,225 --> 01:22:44,651
[SPEAKER_22]: I just want to say how excited we are as a community, those of us involved in housing Medford, to have this new tool that will be available.

1124
01:22:46,075 --> 01:22:53,601
[SPEAKER_22]: We already have some very helpful tools in Medford, including the CPA funds, which are making a real difference.

1125
01:22:54,101 --> 01:23:06,570
[SPEAKER_22]: The Affordable Housing Trust is gonna give us more opportunity to bring additional funding, additional resources, land, more opportunities to build and preserve affordable housing.

1126
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:14,256
[SPEAKER_22]: So I just wanna add my thanks and congratulations for all the work that so many people have done over

1127
01:23:16,737 --> 01:23:17,778
[SPEAKER_22]: this past several years.

1128
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:18,899
[SPEAKER_22]: So thank you.

1129
01:23:18,959 --> 01:23:19,339
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1130
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:22,401
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember talking with you about this at your house when I was door knocking.

1131
01:23:22,441 --> 01:23:23,341
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly right.

1132
01:23:23,701 --> 01:23:23,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1133
01:23:24,402 --> 01:23:25,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Glad we could deliver.

1134
01:23:26,383 --> 01:23:27,144
[SPEAKER_05]: But we haven't voted yet.

1135
01:23:27,864 --> 01:23:32,507
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion from members of the public or any counselors who wish to speak at this time?

1136
01:23:34,408 --> 01:23:44,274
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of Vice President Bears as amended by Vice President Bears to adopt the amendments and approve for first reading as seconded by Councilor Knight,

1137
01:23:45,954 --> 01:23:47,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll when you're ready.

1138
01:23:50,576 --> 01:23:53,538
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Councilor Niestle you're second I apologize.

1139
01:23:53,858 --> 01:23:54,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1140
01:23:55,339 --> 01:23:55,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1141
01:23:55,779 --> 01:23:55,919
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1142
01:24:14,413 --> 01:24:19,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes, the paper is approved for first reading.

1143
01:24:21,158 --> 01:24:24,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, he gave me some other paper numbers, I'm gonna find where I wrote them down.

1144
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:26,282
[SPEAKER_05]: 23-044 is, okay.

1145
01:24:26,302 --> 01:24:27,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great, thank you.

1146
01:24:36,015 --> 01:24:43,560
[SPEAKER_05]: Communications from the Mayor, 23-044 to Honorable President Morell and members of the Medford City Council regarding loan order sidewalk construction and equipment bonds.

1147
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:53,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear President Morell and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following loan order, City of Medford loan order sidewalk construction and equipment bonds.

1148
01:24:54,586 --> 01:25:03,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it ordered that $1,500,000 is appropriate for the purpose of constructing and reconstructing sidewalks and acquiring a sidewalk grinder, asphalt pathing equipment,

1149
01:25:03,865 --> 01:25:22,129
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called spread, including all costs incidental and thereto, and that to meet this appropriation, the treasurer, with the approval of the mayor, is authorized to borrow a set amount pursuant to Chapter 44, Section 7.1 of the General Laws, or pursuant to issue bonds or notes of the city, therefore.

1150
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:48,371
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the order the author is authorized to file an application with the appropriate officials of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Commonwealth quote Commonwealth to qualify under chapter 44A of the general laws and any and all bonds of the city authorized to be borrowed pursuant to this loan order and provide such information and execute such documents as such officials of the Commonwealth may require in connection there with respectfully submitted Brianna Lungo, current mayor.

1151
01:25:48,711 --> 01:25:50,793
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do believe we have DBW commissioner

1152
01:25:51,597 --> 01:25:52,497
[SPEAKER_05]: Tim McGivern to speak.

1153
01:25:52,537 --> 01:25:54,758
[SPEAKER_05]: I also see Councilor Knight with his hand up.

1154
01:25:55,898 --> 01:25:58,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight, do you want to speak now or wait to hear from Commissioner McGivern?

1155
01:25:58,979 --> 01:26:00,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to speak, Madam President.

1156
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:03,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Please go ahead.

1157
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:08,421
[SPEAKER_02]: The paper before us is a paper where I question whether or not it's in proper form.

1158
01:26:09,802 --> 01:26:18,284
[SPEAKER_02]: If we look at the Medford City Council rules, Rule 30 will read that every order before a bond issue shall

1159
01:26:19,068 --> 01:26:27,770
[SPEAKER_02]: before its passage be referred to the city solicitor, who shall forthwith examine the same as to its legality and notify the council in writing of its findings.

1160
01:26:29,391 --> 01:26:34,192
[SPEAKER_02]: The city solicitor is a position established by ordinance, Madam President.

1161
01:26:34,732 --> 01:26:36,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Section 2-651, city solicitor.

1162
01:26:37,052 --> 01:26:38,733
[SPEAKER_02]: There shall be a city solicitor.

1163
01:26:39,373 --> 01:26:39,913
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have one.

1164
01:26:41,193 --> 01:26:47,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Section 2-654, duties to legal instruments of the city solicitor.

1165
01:26:48,112 --> 01:26:55,559
[SPEAKER_02]: The city solicitor shall advise and cause to be drafted bonds and other legal instruments of whatever as required by the mayor or the council.

1166
01:26:56,179 --> 01:27:00,663
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, the city solicitor did not draft this paper because we do not have one.

1167
01:27:02,425 --> 01:27:06,848
[SPEAKER_02]: KP law is time and time again, confirm that they are not the city's attorney.

1168
01:27:07,329 --> 01:27:09,171
[SPEAKER_02]: They are the mayor's private legal counsel.

1169
01:27:10,512 --> 01:27:13,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Their client is the mayor, no more, no less.

1170
01:27:14,841 --> 01:27:23,083
[SPEAKER_02]: I question as to whether or not this paper meets the legal standard of merit and would move to have it sent to the Office of the Attorney General for an independent review.

1171
01:27:27,084 --> 01:27:27,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1172
01:27:29,184 --> 01:27:32,785
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion from the Council before we hear from Commissioner McPherson?

1173
01:27:32,805 --> 01:27:34,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpallo.

1174
01:27:35,065 --> 01:27:36,566
[SPEAKER_15]: I thank you, Madam President.

1175
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:42,507
[SPEAKER_15]: I, too, expressed concern early in the whole meeting.

1176
01:27:45,014 --> 01:27:47,569
[SPEAKER_15]: with no outlook.

1177
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:52,993
[SPEAKER_15]: or vision of our finances, I find it very difficult to support any paper.

1178
01:27:53,713 --> 01:28:08,182
[SPEAKER_15]: And I know I appreciate all the work that Tim you're doing and your other department heads, but I hope you can understand that as a city councilor that doesn't know the financial climate of our community.

1179
01:28:08,922 --> 01:28:11,163
[SPEAKER_15]: And then being given a paper $1.5 million to bond to me is very, very,

1180
01:28:18,728 --> 01:28:21,229
[SPEAKER_15]: unacceptable, to say the least.

1181
01:28:21,309 --> 01:28:39,234
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that the other piece that I found alarming is that when we're looking at sidewalk repairs, we've also asked for an update to what the last 1.5 million that I balked at, if we all recall, that we all approved that because we needed it.

1182
01:28:39,954 --> 01:28:44,175
[SPEAKER_15]: And to be honest with you, I don't see much work going on on sidewalks.

1183
01:28:46,267 --> 01:28:54,724
[SPEAKER_15]: and we've asked for a report of an update and we haven't gotten that either unless I missed that but I haven't gotten an update with that so I

1184
01:28:56,294 --> 01:29:25,772
[SPEAKER_15]: I would move to table this until both Councilor Knight's feedback is responded, his motion responded, and we get the update on where that money went for the last one and a half million dollars that we bonded for sidewalk repair, replacement, and stump removal, because I'm still getting a lot of phone calls that sidewalks are a mess, and I haven't seen that list that we've asked for.

1185
01:29:26,866 --> 01:29:30,469
[SPEAKER_15]: So, I apologize, but that's how I feel.

1186
01:29:32,651 --> 01:29:33,451
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1187
01:29:33,511 --> 01:29:38,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli asked a question that I brought up in a motion a few months ago.

1188
01:29:40,136 --> 01:29:42,678
[SPEAKER_14]: Where are we at with the money that we allocated last year?

1189
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:45,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you know where we at, Senator?

1190
01:29:47,473 --> 01:29:49,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

1191
01:29:50,114 --> 01:29:52,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much, Madam President.

1192
01:29:53,437 --> 01:29:58,521
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I know that we have a contract open and we started that we did get a late start on last year's round.

1193
01:29:59,101 --> 01:30:03,024
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think as the council knows, we do request an amount of money every year.

1194
01:30:03,044 --> 01:30:09,129
[SPEAKER_08]: And this time we're including some equipment as part of my strategy to move some of this in house.

1195
01:30:10,109 --> 01:30:12,531
[SPEAKER_08]: We do have a lot of sidewalk work to do.

1196
01:30:12,691 --> 01:30:14,933
[SPEAKER_08]: And we also have, I think we have about

1197
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:27,441
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, $300,000 or $400,000 worth of stump and sidewalk contract that we did last season.

1198
01:30:28,222 --> 01:30:36,189
[SPEAKER_08]: We still have about $300,000 or so worth of stumps to do, and we have a bunch of the sidewalk to do.

1199
01:30:36,309 --> 01:30:36,970
[SPEAKER_08]: And then this would be

1200
01:30:37,455 --> 01:30:38,216
[SPEAKER_08]: basically next.

1201
01:30:39,557 --> 01:30:44,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably one of the reasons why it hasn't been seen is because we have so much sidewalk, so much sidewalk work to do.

1202
01:30:45,802 --> 01:30:52,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Doing half a million or a million dollars every year of spot repairs hasn't really been a good use of money, in my opinion, in the past.

1203
01:30:53,148 --> 01:30:54,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Owen and I are working on a much different strategy.

1204
01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:58,173
[SPEAKER_08]: It started before Owen began, looking at it from a

1205
01:31:01,722 --> 01:31:08,188
[SPEAKER_08]: how often are the sidewalks used, so foot traffic, criticality, what are they located near hospitals, schools, things like that.

1206
01:31:08,769 --> 01:31:13,313
[SPEAKER_08]: We had all of our sidewalks evaluated for obstructions and whether or not it's to code.

1207
01:31:13,353 --> 01:31:16,556
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have an incredible amount of data, which we haven't had in previous years.

1208
01:31:16,996 --> 01:31:22,341
[SPEAKER_08]: So the last round of sidewalk work and then this round of sidewalk work is really focusing on

1209
01:31:23,342 --> 01:31:30,731
[SPEAKER_08]: the data, so the hotspots, we call them, and then grouping work so it's not spot repair, so it's efficient.

1210
01:31:30,831 --> 01:31:37,018
[SPEAKER_08]: So production work as opposed to spot repair work, we could probably get twice as much done for the dollar.

1211
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:38,560
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's really our strategy here.

1212
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:40,042
[SPEAKER_08]: $1.5 million, that would include about

1213
01:31:43,376 --> 01:31:47,079
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, $350,000, maybe $400,000 worth of equipment.

1214
01:31:47,359 --> 01:31:49,541
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're working on actually getting that quoted now.

1215
01:31:49,881 --> 01:31:56,766
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would give us a sidewalk grinder in-house so we can take care of two-inch obstructions easily in-house, so we don't have to replace the whole panel.

1216
01:31:57,767 --> 01:32:01,390
[SPEAKER_08]: That will empower in-house work to satisfy a lot of our requests.

1217
01:32:02,130 --> 01:32:03,652
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also patching equipment.

1218
01:32:04,092 --> 01:32:13,120
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm trying to get us to move or transition from pothole work to hot patch work.

1219
01:32:14,361 --> 01:32:22,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Because as we move on in the years here, more of our spider cracking is going to open up to potholes, especially with these freeze-thaw cycles.

1220
01:32:22,888 --> 01:32:29,214
[SPEAKER_08]: So getting our crew up to speed with hot patch repair is a critical part of that.

1221
01:32:30,275 --> 01:32:32,396
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the sidewalk grinding is a critical part of that.

1222
01:32:32,456 --> 01:32:35,479
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the package in front of you at the moment.

1223
01:32:35,499 --> 01:32:39,002
[SPEAKER_08]: We're happy, you know, we understand that loans take readings and things like that.

1224
01:32:39,082 --> 01:32:43,365
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, Owen and I are happy to provide the council with whatever information is needed.

1225
01:32:43,425 --> 01:32:52,793
[SPEAKER_08]: I do believe, and Owen can correct me if I'm wrong, I do believe we have reported to the mayor the status of all the open contracts up until this moment.

1226
01:32:52,853 --> 01:32:56,196
[SPEAKER_08]: So to prepare us for going into the next construction season.

1227
01:32:56,896 --> 01:33:01,157
[SPEAKER_08]: So if that information hasn't made it to this council yet, I imagine that it's on its way, and I don't know why it hasn't.

1228
01:33:01,758 --> 01:33:01,918
[SPEAKER_08]: So.

1229
01:33:02,158 --> 01:33:08,660
[SPEAKER_14]: So, as we're doing the sidewalk, so are we making base handicap accessible also, if need be?

1230
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:09,740
[SPEAKER_14]: If need be, yeah.

1231
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:12,080
[SPEAKER_14]: And so that's one of the focuses that we have, yeah.

1232
01:33:12,581 --> 01:33:23,704
[SPEAKER_14]: And I am glad that, you know, you are purchasing some equipment, but as Councilor Scott Pele and I brought up many, many times, so this is $2 million in two years.

1233
01:33:25,370 --> 01:33:31,954
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to have seen a sidewalk group doing sidewalks every day here.

1234
01:33:32,354 --> 01:33:33,075
[SPEAKER_14]: We could get there.

1235
01:33:33,955 --> 01:33:36,657
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't do it all at once, but I share that vision.

1236
01:33:36,937 --> 01:33:41,120
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we have enough sidewalk work that we could keep them busy.

1237
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:42,460
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now,

1238
01:33:44,039 --> 01:33:47,842
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, that definitely isn't the cause, but this is a first step in that direction.

1239
01:33:48,683 --> 01:33:51,265
[SPEAKER_08]: We have asphalt and we have sidewalk.

1240
01:33:51,705 --> 01:33:56,989
[SPEAKER_08]: In my personal opinion, and I think Owen would agree with me, our asphalt is at the priority.

1241
01:33:57,029 --> 01:34:04,355
[SPEAKER_08]: So we want to get the asphalt equipment first, which is a small spreader, an eight foot spreader, a small grinder, something that we can ride.

1242
01:34:04,375 --> 01:34:05,115
[SPEAKER_08]: That's for the streets.

1243
01:34:05,135 --> 01:34:06,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, absolutely.

1244
01:34:06,916 --> 01:34:08,778
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the sidewalk grinder, which is also part of this.

1245
01:34:09,358 --> 01:34:11,860
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd say 60, I don't know the exact percentage, 60, 70%.

1246
01:34:13,121 --> 01:34:23,796
[SPEAKER_08]: some high percentage of sidewalk complaints we receive are two-inch heaps and we put it on a list for a sidewalk contract and we spend, you know,

1247
01:34:26,069 --> 01:34:30,992
[SPEAKER_08]: three, $4,000 to break the panel out, put a new panel in, and then mobilize to a new location.

1248
01:34:31,692 --> 01:34:34,834
[SPEAKER_08]: So what I'm trying to do is say, well, no, we can just have our in-house crew.

1249
01:34:34,874 --> 01:34:42,238
[SPEAKER_08]: And so this is step number one, really, to have an in-house sidewalk crew, to get them used to a grinder machine, and then say, okay, we're used to a grinder machine.

1250
01:34:42,918 --> 01:34:44,339
[SPEAKER_08]: We already know how to pour panels.

1251
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:47,701
[SPEAKER_08]: Then it becomes a question of manpower.

1252
01:34:48,121 --> 01:34:53,124
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and then, you know, in future budgets, you'll see me here presenting for additional manpower.

1253
01:34:53,744 --> 01:34:56,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me see, sidewalk crew is something that I've been looking for.

1254
01:34:56,506 --> 01:34:57,427
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of information if I can.

1255
01:34:57,567 --> 01:34:58,708
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Councilor Scarpelli.

1256
01:34:58,868 --> 01:34:59,769
[SPEAKER_15]: Tim, I appreciate that.

1257
01:35:02,611 --> 01:35:09,396
[SPEAKER_15]: As one councilor, I stood here in my first budget and asked for a sidewalk hot top crew.

1258
01:35:10,537 --> 01:35:17,302
[SPEAKER_15]: We worked with the neighboring DPW commissioner that put everything into place, a whole funding mechanism, which isn't a lot of money.

1259
01:35:18,507 --> 01:35:25,515
[SPEAKER_15]: But the most important thing they said was before we get that equipment, make sure you have enough people that are going to run that equipment.

1260
01:35:25,856 --> 01:35:25,976
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1261
01:35:26,476 --> 01:35:30,641
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think we're putting the cart in front of the horse because I think you're right.

1262
01:35:30,862 --> 01:35:31,663
[SPEAKER_15]: We need our crew.

1263
01:35:31,683 --> 01:35:34,886
[SPEAKER_15]: We need this equipment, but we need the crew to do it.

1264
01:35:36,144 --> 01:35:39,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, which is why I don't have a whole slate of sidewalk equipment on here.

1265
01:35:39,228 --> 01:35:51,321
[SPEAKER_08]: That is why that is the reason why which is why I have one small piece of equipment, because we can we can with our current staffing, we can handle one sidewalk planer, which is what's on there, and we can also what.

1266
01:35:52,422 --> 01:35:53,423
[SPEAKER_08]: It is, that is an issue.

1267
01:35:53,443 --> 01:35:58,367
[SPEAKER_08]: So transitioning from hot pothole mix to hot patching is the same crew.

1268
01:35:58,687 --> 01:36:02,870
[SPEAKER_08]: So instead of two days of potholes, we're going out one day potholes, one day patching.

1269
01:36:03,511 --> 01:36:04,772
[SPEAKER_08]: I would completely agree.

1270
01:36:04,792 --> 01:36:11,017
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't want, you can't, we can't, which is why I don't have a 12 foot spreader on here, you know, and a full size spreader.

1271
01:36:11,077 --> 01:36:13,199
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to see a capital plant, to be honest with you.

1272
01:36:13,279 --> 01:36:14,099
[SPEAKER_08]: These are in there, yeah.

1273
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:15,721
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a plan.

1274
01:36:15,761 --> 01:36:16,502
[SPEAKER_15]: We have a capital plan.

1275
01:36:16,742 --> 01:36:18,024
[SPEAKER_15]: I submitted a request.

1276
01:36:18,084 --> 01:36:19,665
[SPEAKER_15]: I know the mayor's office.

1277
01:36:19,726 --> 01:36:20,106
[SPEAKER_15]: That's good.

1278
01:36:20,186 --> 01:36:25,592
[SPEAKER_15]: So the whole idea is that truck and the equipment needed with three staff members.

1279
01:36:25,773 --> 01:36:29,977
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't a lot of money considering what we've been putting in for bonds over the last four or five years.

1280
01:36:30,698 --> 01:36:31,819
[SPEAKER_15]: It really pays for itself.

1281
01:36:31,839 --> 01:36:33,400
[SPEAKER_15]: So I applaud your effort.

1282
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:33,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1283
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:35,861
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can't pay obviously pay for personnel.

1284
01:36:35,941 --> 01:36:36,702
[SPEAKER_08]: No, we know, we know.

1285
01:36:37,262 --> 01:36:39,104
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a step in together.

1286
01:36:39,364 --> 01:36:57,676
[SPEAKER_08]: And I will say to there's enough work in the city that we both we need to think about this strategically, it needs to happen, a portion in house and a portion out house, the portion out house, we have a pretty good handle on the portion in house, as we all know, we have obviously some fiscal issues that we're trying to figure out and work through.

1287
01:36:58,356 --> 01:37:08,097
[SPEAKER_08]: figure out how to best find that and the strategy piece is on my plate to present a strategy so i've been doing i appreciate that it's on the radar now so thank you absolutely absolutely so anyway so jim

1288
01:37:09,201 --> 01:37:10,462
[SPEAKER_14]: getting off the side, which is a little speck.

1289
01:37:10,522 --> 01:37:18,768
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, a couple of years ago, myself and Councilor Falco had presented the streets where they grind and pave all the same thing.

1290
01:37:19,228 --> 01:37:20,529
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that something where we're gonna look into?

1291
01:37:21,069 --> 01:37:22,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Reclamation of asphalt.

1292
01:37:22,310 --> 01:37:23,471
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, yeah.

1293
01:37:23,931 --> 01:37:35,379
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not saying for the main streets, but maybe we can get some of the, I know when I had met with them, with Councilor Falco, one of the MMA shows, and they had volunteered to come down and do a couple of streets

1294
01:37:36,139 --> 01:37:37,421
[SPEAKER_14]: It'd be part of a pilot program.

1295
01:37:37,781 --> 01:37:41,825
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that something that's being thought of again or is it in your wheelhouse?

1296
01:37:41,985 --> 01:37:43,046
[SPEAKER_08]: It is in our wheelhouse.

1297
01:37:43,106 --> 01:37:46,229
[SPEAKER_08]: When that first brought up, when I was city engineer, I did review it.

1298
01:37:46,790 --> 01:37:52,576
[SPEAKER_08]: I did get an education on it, especially with recycled content and asphalt life and things like that.

1299
01:37:54,938 --> 01:38:06,184
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a lot of work to do just with making sure that we're doing maintenance band work, which is things like crack sealing, overlays at the proper time.

1300
01:38:09,264 --> 01:38:15,788
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, to avoid having to rebuild later on, coordinating with utility companies.

1301
01:38:15,948 --> 01:38:17,549
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have a whole host of issues.

1302
01:38:17,990 --> 01:38:19,891
[SPEAKER_08]: And I will say that that's an option.

1303
01:38:20,251 --> 01:38:21,472
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we're keeping it on the table.

1304
01:38:22,552 --> 01:38:26,615
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's not something that we have the time and the resources to experiment with at the moment.

1305
01:38:26,995 --> 01:38:31,499
[SPEAKER_08]: It would require a little bit more oversight, making sure that it's happening exactly to spec.

1306
01:38:31,699 --> 01:38:34,741
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be like a special project with the pilot.

1307
01:38:36,202 --> 01:38:46,931
[SPEAKER_08]: The DPW now in engineering, my focus was just getting us riding the bike before we start doing tricks, if I could put it that way.

1308
01:38:47,732 --> 01:38:49,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1309
01:38:49,933 --> 01:38:50,694
[SPEAKER_05]: That's embarrassing.

1310
01:38:53,601 --> 01:38:58,005
[SPEAKER_06]: BMX guy, maybe I like analogies and things like that.

1311
01:38:58,025 --> 01:38:58,766
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully,

1312
01:39:02,165 --> 01:39:04,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Just two questions.

1313
01:39:05,006 --> 01:39:06,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, one comment, one question.

1314
01:39:06,227 --> 01:39:11,769
[SPEAKER_06]: One, I was talking to Steve today, the other day, and he seemed pretty excited about some of the new equipment.

1315
01:39:12,169 --> 01:39:13,750
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was a good sign.

1316
01:39:15,491 --> 01:39:30,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Second piece, just to kind of contextualize this, and just let me know if I'm getting it wrong, the assessment that we did, what, two fiscal years ago now, almost three fiscal years ago now, the sidewalk scope alone was 25, 30 million, right, to get to a state of good repair, maybe even more than that.

1317
01:39:30,997 --> 01:39:33,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a year in the ballpark.

1318
01:39:33,659 --> 01:39:41,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I just wanted to put that out there that, you know, 1.5 million or, you know, to 1.5 million may sound like a lot but it's

1319
01:39:43,345 --> 01:39:44,625
[SPEAKER_06]: 10% of what our need is.

1320
01:39:45,025 --> 01:39:45,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.

1321
01:39:45,185 --> 01:39:46,326
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why it's hard to see too.

1322
01:39:46,806 --> 01:39:48,547
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we believe me, we're out there.

1323
01:39:48,567 --> 01:39:50,488
[SPEAKER_08]: We're paying the bills and doing the inspections.

1324
01:39:50,928 --> 01:39:53,770
[SPEAKER_08]: But just it is hard to see because it is a drop in bucket.

1325
01:39:54,210 --> 01:39:55,390
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, exactly.

1326
01:39:55,510 --> 01:40:02,214
[SPEAKER_06]: And kind of just want to again confirm here is when you're talking about, you know, that reflects the revenue issue and the funding issue.

1327
01:40:02,714 --> 01:40:06,176
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we need more people we need more equipment we need to really get at it.

1328
01:40:06,776 --> 01:40:06,936
[SPEAKER_06]: But

1329
01:40:07,756 --> 01:40:17,402
[SPEAKER_06]: The strategy you're talking about just to inform that a little bit more that's also coming partially from the sidewalk assessment of the street assessment as well as some additional research that you've done.

1330
01:40:18,487 --> 01:40:35,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah the strategy is mostly based off of our assessments and then of course a part of strategy is what do we have for resources, what can we do now, what can we do in year one, what needs to be in year two, what does the capital plan look like and all that so many moving pieces.

1331
01:40:36,262 --> 01:40:39,125
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't want to reiterate something you already said but I just want to

1332
01:40:39,932 --> 01:40:41,253
[SPEAKER_06]: make sure I'm understanding it right.

1333
01:40:41,333 --> 01:40:48,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically what you're trying to do is pivot resources so that smaller things that we can address in-house, we have the tools and the capacity to do that.

1334
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:56,747
[SPEAKER_06]: And then for the bigger projects, we're focusing on the areas that are most trafficked, where the sidewalks are most used in the city.

1335
01:40:57,688 --> 01:40:59,749
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say both of those characterizations are correct.

1336
01:40:59,950 --> 01:41:00,850
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.

1337
01:41:01,511 --> 01:41:03,273
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that really shows that

1338
01:41:05,325 --> 01:41:12,714
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, something we always talk about is making sure that given the fact that we have limited resources and a lot of need, we're best using the resources that we currently have.

1339
01:41:13,235 --> 01:41:18,942
[SPEAKER_06]: And it seems to me that that's what your departments are really doing with this situation and what you're asking us for.

1340
01:41:20,504 --> 01:41:23,968
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, we have a lot more that needs to be done, but it does seem to be that.

1341
01:41:25,069 --> 01:41:37,995
[SPEAKER_06]: you are trying to acquire the equipment and, you know, put forward the contracts where we can address issues as they happen and address the areas of the city that need help the most.

1342
01:41:38,716 --> 01:41:39,496
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a comment.

1343
01:41:39,516 --> 01:41:40,336
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to respond to that.

1344
01:41:40,576 --> 01:41:41,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1345
01:41:41,597 --> 01:41:44,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1346
01:41:44,418 --> 01:41:50,881
[SPEAKER_15]: I know the Councilor Knight has a motion, I believe, that I seconded, but I just wanted to make sure that

1347
01:41:52,691 --> 01:41:53,712
[SPEAKER_15]: Tim, it's nothing against you.

1348
01:41:53,732 --> 01:41:55,153
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate the hard work you're doing.

1349
01:41:55,653 --> 01:42:06,262
[SPEAKER_15]: But again, I think that to my fellow colleagues that we look at the lack of financial transparency and not understanding who we are right now.

1350
01:42:07,243 --> 01:42:15,809
[SPEAKER_15]: I think to vote for any money paper right now would be a huge detriment as we move forward.

1351
01:42:19,735 --> 01:42:46,581
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm only going to bring this up a thousand times tonight because I think it's important that we're going to get to May and I don't want to say I told you so because the fact that we don't know where we are financially and it's premature to be bringing money papers to this council and asking for things that might end up having a bond for new equipment but the possibility of hiring

1352
01:42:47,583 --> 01:42:52,466
[SPEAKER_15]: isn't even on the radar, looking at possible cuts is what I'm afraid of.

1353
01:42:53,947 --> 01:43:12,439
[SPEAKER_15]: This is what, until we get a clear fiscal vision of where we're going and the understanding, I think it would be really, it would be really reckless for this council to be voting for money papers.

1354
01:43:14,011 --> 01:43:31,407
[SPEAKER_15]: you know, between the lack of legal support that we have, you know, and I think earlier I was so upset because I just keep reading this KP law stuff and all I keep talking to different city solicitors and understanding that every time that phone rings and they pick it up, it's $700 and the clock starts.

1355
01:43:33,709 --> 01:43:37,030
[SPEAKER_15]: with $700 and we don't know where we are financially.

1356
01:43:37,090 --> 01:43:54,718
[SPEAKER_15]: So again, I'm going to share this a thousand times and I'm going to sound like a broken record, but I'm going to tell you, I think it's irresponsible for us to vote for money papers until we have the proper legal support and knowledge of our fiscal outlook.

1357
01:43:54,778 --> 01:43:55,978
[SPEAKER_15]: So thank you.

1358
01:44:00,438 --> 01:44:12,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Before we go back to President Bears, Commissioner McGibbon, if we were to table this to get that opinion from the AG, understanding you have contracts open actually from the last bond, would this push back the timing of any work if we were to wait?

1359
01:44:13,147 --> 01:44:15,389
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I hope it wouldn't take us that long to get that opinion.

1360
01:44:17,110 --> 01:44:20,293
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to be hitting the streets running this spring.

1361
01:44:21,073 --> 01:44:22,314
[SPEAKER_08]: So not the sidewalk piece.

1362
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:25,180
[SPEAKER_08]: equipment piece.

1363
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:31,322
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't know the timelines on that, but it's similar to what Chief Friedman was saying before.

1364
01:44:31,342 --> 01:44:35,843
[SPEAKER_08]: The equipment backlog and lead time issue is an issue with DPW2.

1365
01:44:37,623 --> 01:44:39,364
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, we're looking at 12 months.

1366
01:44:39,704 --> 01:44:43,105
[SPEAKER_08]: I know he's looking at, we're looking at like 12 for lead times for vehicles.

1367
01:44:44,085 --> 01:44:48,406
[SPEAKER_08]: So, but I, you know, to really respond, if this were,

1368
01:44:49,622 --> 01:44:51,443
[SPEAKER_08]: delayed for a short period of time.

1369
01:44:51,483 --> 01:44:54,803
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think it would, you know, be a critical hit.

1370
01:44:55,224 --> 01:44:56,004
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

1371
01:44:56,024 --> 01:45:00,745
[SPEAKER_05]: So and then for that equipment piece, we're actually looking at next year, not because of the delay.

1372
01:45:02,026 --> 01:45:04,406
[SPEAKER_08]: The smaller piece of equipment, we're going to have shortly time.

1373
01:45:04,806 --> 01:45:07,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the longer stuff, like the spreader, for example, may be a little bit longer.

1374
01:45:07,967 --> 01:45:10,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Vehicle builds are about 12 months.

1375
01:45:10,588 --> 01:45:14,309
[SPEAKER_08]: So something smaller could, you know, we could be looking at eight, nine months, something like that.

1376
01:45:14,669 --> 01:45:17,650
[SPEAKER_08]: But across the board, if it's made of steel, I think it's delayed.

1377
01:45:18,735 --> 01:45:19,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, thank you.

1378
01:45:19,396 --> 01:45:19,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Bears.

1379
01:45:20,897 --> 01:45:21,777
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1380
01:45:24,139 --> 01:45:34,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, to the point around delaying this, you know, I'd be comfortable tabling for our one meeting and requesting an opinion from the Attorney General.

1381
01:45:34,748 --> 01:45:40,172
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the other thing we just need to hear, and again, a lot of this is a communication question, right?

1382
01:45:40,212 --> 01:45:47,678
[SPEAKER_06]: On the finances, we had what I thought was a good conversation last week with the finance director on the revenue side of finance.

1383
01:45:49,039 --> 01:45:51,941
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the question obviously is going to be on the expense side of finance.

1384
01:45:51,981 --> 01:46:02,287
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's, you know, communication that needs to happen there where, you know, we need, they just need to get us information that we need.

1385
01:46:02,307 --> 01:46:11,552
[SPEAKER_06]: But in any case, I think the communication issue here is to Councilor Knight's point, we have not heard the administration say that KP Law is functioning as the acting city solicitor.

1386
01:46:13,072 --> 01:46:19,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, in all senses of all operations of the city, they are obviously serving as the acting city solicitor.

1387
01:46:22,748 --> 01:46:26,230
[SPEAKER_06]: I just think we need to get them, somebody from the administration needs to come here and say that.

1388
01:46:26,310 --> 01:46:31,112
[SPEAKER_06]: So personally, I would feel comfortable tabling this to our next meeting on March 14th.

1389
01:46:32,993 --> 01:46:36,195
[SPEAKER_06]: If we want to send it to the Attorney General's office for legal review, that's fine with me.

1390
01:46:36,235 --> 01:46:37,515
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, Bond Council reviewed this.

1391
01:46:37,575 --> 01:46:42,598
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe Bond Council, Jay Gonzalez reviewed this, you know, and that's the Bond Council we've always used.

1392
01:46:43,738 --> 01:46:45,319
[SPEAKER_06]: KP Law obviously wrote this report.

1393
01:46:45,439 --> 01:46:47,300
[SPEAKER_06]: If they're functioning as the acting city solicitor,

1394
01:46:47,980 --> 01:46:49,662
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should just need to know that.

1395
01:46:50,863 --> 01:46:53,005
[SPEAKER_06]: I hear everyone on the legal question.

1396
01:46:53,306 --> 01:47:03,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Quite frankly, we held the administration to account to fund an assistant city solicitor and the position still is unfilled.

1397
01:47:03,956 --> 01:47:08,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, we can debate why the position's unfilled, sure.

1398
01:47:09,181 --> 01:47:11,824
[SPEAKER_06]: But in my view, we won that fight.

1399
01:47:13,325 --> 01:47:16,686
[SPEAKER_06]: We said we want in-house legal counsel and the budget has in-house legal counsel.

1400
01:47:17,226 --> 01:47:20,348
[SPEAKER_06]: The question is just bringing the people on in those positions.

1401
01:47:21,748 --> 01:47:25,489
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just, I hear what everyone's saying.

1402
01:47:25,649 --> 01:47:32,272
[SPEAKER_06]: If the administration would just say whether or not KP Law is serving as the acting city solicitor, I think that would be helpful communication for us to have.

1403
01:47:33,348 --> 01:47:42,214
[SPEAKER_06]: and maybe it would change our view and potentially a little bit about who they work for and who they don't work for, because I believe if they are serving as acting city solicitor, they would be working for us too.

1404
01:47:43,615 --> 01:47:47,737
[SPEAKER_06]: But in any case, I'm happy to support a tabling for one meeting.

1405
01:47:48,578 --> 01:47:58,484
[SPEAKER_06]: And I would request either request to amend council rights motion or propose a separate motion that we request that the mayor and city administration

1406
01:47:59,945 --> 01:48:05,326
[SPEAKER_06]: tell the council whether or not KP law is currently serving as the acting city solicitor for the city of Medford.

1407
01:48:05,747 --> 01:48:06,047
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1408
01:48:06,907 --> 01:48:09,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1409
01:48:09,367 --> 01:48:11,308
[SPEAKER_02]: To that point, Councilor Benson, thank you very much.

1410
01:48:14,008 --> 01:48:16,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Can KP law serve as the assistant city solicitor?

1411
01:48:16,709 --> 01:48:24,651
[SPEAKER_02]: Because based upon the ordinance that this council passed at some point in time, it says there shall be a city solicitor, and there shall also be an assistant.

1412
01:48:24,831 --> 01:48:28,492
[SPEAKER_02]: And when there is no city solicitor, the assistant shall be appointed solicitor.

1413
01:48:29,235 --> 01:48:30,216
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what the ordinance says.

1414
01:48:31,497 --> 01:48:44,026
[SPEAKER_02]: So can the mayor unilaterally hire a law firm to work and be compensated at a rate of pay and a scale of pay far outside the compensation schedule that's established by the ordinance?

1415
01:48:44,767 --> 01:48:45,467
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think she can.

1416
01:48:45,748 --> 01:48:50,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think she can appoint a law firm into a position that's defined by ordinance with a salary attached to it.

1417
01:48:50,925 --> 01:48:53,446
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have to, at some point, bring this to a head.

1418
01:48:53,947 --> 01:48:58,309
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, six months ago, seven, eight months ago now, we sat here and we debated a budget.

1419
01:48:58,629 --> 01:49:00,570
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you said, the mayor said, oh, no problem.

1420
01:49:00,590 --> 01:49:02,311
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have assistant city solicitor for you guys.

1421
01:49:02,331 --> 01:49:02,971
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to post it.

1422
01:49:02,991 --> 01:49:04,572
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be an in-house position.

1423
01:49:04,972 --> 01:49:05,693
[SPEAKER_02]: We still don't have it.

1424
01:49:06,233 --> 01:49:07,013
[SPEAKER_02]: And we still don't have it.

1425
01:49:07,134 --> 01:49:08,854
[SPEAKER_02]: That was all smoke to get the budget passed.

1426
01:49:09,335 --> 01:49:13,117
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the mayor never had any intention of filling that position because if she did, it would be filled.

1427
01:49:14,057 --> 01:49:16,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, so that's, that's why I raised the issue.

1428
01:49:16,699 --> 01:49:19,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we, we have no guidance whatsoever.

1429
01:49:20,345 --> 01:49:25,250
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're like the clown show, you know, we sit here and we talk and we have great ideas.

1430
01:49:25,790 --> 01:49:32,597
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we want to follow through and we'd be very productive if we had the tools that were necessary to get the job done, but we don't.

1431
01:49:33,458 --> 01:49:40,965
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very frustrating to not have those tools, especially when we have such a talented group of people that could do such good work, you know?

1432
01:49:41,486 --> 01:49:43,788
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's time we bring this thing to a head.

1433
01:49:45,959 --> 01:49:48,080
[SPEAKER_02]: does the city of Medford require a city solicitor?

1434
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:49,340
[SPEAKER_02]: The ordinance says it does.

1435
01:49:49,860 --> 01:49:50,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why there isn't one.

1436
01:49:51,001 --> 01:50:02,704
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we don't have one, then there's a problem because there hasn't been one for quite a long period of time, which means that we're operating outside the ordinance, outside the defined parameters of how our government's supposed to operate.

1437
01:50:04,825 --> 01:50:08,066
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's like saying there's supposed to be a secretary of state, but we're just not going to have one.

1438
01:50:13,928 --> 01:50:15,049
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I raised it.

1439
01:50:15,830 --> 01:50:20,934
[SPEAKER_02]: And to the point of the paper before us, I support the paper and its theory.

1440
01:50:21,134 --> 01:50:22,155
[SPEAKER_02]: We need this equipment.

1441
01:50:22,275 --> 01:50:25,818
[SPEAKER_02]: We need these jobs to be able to be performed in-house.

1442
01:50:26,018 --> 01:50:26,919
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get this done.

1443
01:50:27,439 --> 01:50:30,642
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also have $700,000 of a $1.5 million appropriation that we made last year that still remains unspent.

1444
01:50:34,365 --> 01:50:39,948
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so in that regard, I think that, you know, we're not going to be in that bad of shape to put this off.

1445
01:50:39,969 --> 01:50:40,989
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we want to wait a week.

1446
01:50:41,029 --> 01:50:42,650
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to get a response in a week or two weeks.

1447
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:44,451
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to get a response by March 14th.

1448
01:50:44,551 --> 01:50:52,676
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you know, it's going to take at least 30 days to get a legal response from the attorney general's office, you know, but, you know, it has to come to a head at some point.

1449
01:50:52,976 --> 01:50:56,119
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I support the paper that's before us, you know what I mean?

1450
01:50:56,139 --> 01:50:58,521
[SPEAKER_02]: You look at the capital plan, you know, you see these things in there.

1451
01:50:58,942 --> 01:51:01,184
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not something that we haven't planned for.

1452
01:51:01,824 --> 01:51:03,546
[SPEAKER_02]: You look at the funding sources, that's a little different.

1453
01:51:03,566 --> 01:51:08,350
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you look at the funding sources in the capital plan, most of it says that it's going to be general fund debt.

1454
01:51:08,831 --> 01:51:10,212
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to be something that's borrowed.

1455
01:51:10,632 --> 01:51:13,235
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's where in lies the rub.

1456
01:51:13,635 --> 01:51:14,456
[SPEAKER_02]: But ultimately,

1457
01:51:16,104 --> 01:51:21,485
[SPEAKER_02]: In theory, it's a good paper, but in terms of process and procedure, this is something that we need to address.

1458
01:51:21,605 --> 01:51:23,625
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that this is a way that we can do it.

1459
01:51:23,645 --> 01:51:28,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor.

1460
01:51:28,266 --> 01:51:28,886
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins.

1461
01:51:29,806 --> 01:51:35,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you, Tim, for being here and providing helpful context around this paper.

1462
01:51:35,748 --> 01:51:40,028
[SPEAKER_04]: I think my feelings are similar to Vice President Bears.

1463
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:43,929
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel that I would be comfortable going forward with this

1464
01:51:44,807 --> 01:51:45,648
[SPEAKER_04]: paper this evening.

1465
01:51:45,908 --> 01:51:49,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm comfortable tabling it if we table it to a date certain, March 14th, our next meeting.

1466
01:51:49,851 --> 01:51:57,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is an issue that we encounter very often as a council.

1467
01:51:57,737 --> 01:52:11,969
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very sympathetic to our need to take actions that force action because we haven't had a super consistent track record of seamless collaboration.

1468
01:52:13,658 --> 01:52:27,806
[SPEAKER_04]: So far, that being said, you know, I feel like I also say this often, there are, you know, I think every individual player has to make decisions about what they're willing to hold up and what they're not willing to see held up.

1469
01:52:28,067 --> 01:52:30,508
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of these projects, you know, that come before us are important.

1470
01:52:30,528 --> 01:52:38,012
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's up to each of us to make our consideration of what we're willing to place on hold in order to try to force another action.

1471
01:52:38,093 --> 01:52:38,773
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this is

1472
01:52:39,409 --> 01:52:40,289
[SPEAKER_04]: a really important paper.

1473
01:52:40,309 --> 01:52:44,431
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that, you know, sidewalk repair and road repair is an accessibility issue that touches everybody in the community.

1474
01:52:44,451 --> 01:52:46,432
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm comfortable tabling it for one meeting.

1475
01:52:46,472 --> 01:52:50,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Beyond that, you know, I think this is really important to make sure that it goes forward.

1476
01:52:50,213 --> 01:53:00,437
[SPEAKER_04]: And these greater issues of budget and, you know, continuing, I think what we've had are really great first steps recently in greater budget transparency, continuing those.

1477
01:53:00,457 --> 01:53:02,638
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that we continue those

1478
01:53:03,379 --> 01:53:24,270
[SPEAKER_04]: in parallel, and perhaps if we are amending this paper to ask the mayor for a determination on if KP Law is functioning as an acting city solicitor, if we could also perhaps include an update on where we are at with hiring a city solicitor and assistant city solicitor.

1479
01:53:25,110 --> 01:53:26,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that that was in the works.

1480
01:53:26,471 --> 01:53:27,852
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had an update in a while.

1481
01:53:28,492 --> 01:53:31,054
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm taking it on good faith that that's a real project.

1482
01:53:31,094 --> 01:53:31,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe that it is.

1483
01:53:32,338 --> 01:53:39,562
[SPEAKER_04]: and I think that we're all incredibly eager to see whether we actually get the opportunity to know when that in-house legal counsel will arrive.

1484
01:53:39,802 --> 01:53:40,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1485
01:53:41,062 --> 01:53:41,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1486
01:53:41,903 --> 01:53:43,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion for the council?

1487
01:53:44,584 --> 01:53:47,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to public, I see Matthew Paisley-Berman, hand up.

1488
01:53:50,207 --> 01:53:50,727
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll unmute you.

1489
01:53:50,747 --> 01:53:54,749
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, you just need to hit.

1490
01:53:55,310 --> 01:53:56,410
[SPEAKER_12]: I got it, I got it.

1491
01:53:56,430 --> 01:53:57,671
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've known Tim for,

1492
01:53:58,752 --> 01:53:59,653
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a little echo?

1493
01:53:59,673 --> 01:54:03,636
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I've known Tim for years, many, many years.

1494
01:54:03,956 --> 01:54:08,620
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, Tim and I, we were speaking in I guess it was around September to November 2021.

1495
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:13,904
[SPEAKER_12]: And he was telling me about all the work that he's done with, with Brianna or with our mayor.

1496
01:54:14,284 --> 01:54:21,449
[SPEAKER_12]: and examining all the sidewalks, like every single inch, doing a real audit of the city, figure out all the work that needs to be done.

1497
01:54:21,509 --> 01:54:23,670
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I mean, I've been extremely excited.

1498
01:54:23,690 --> 01:54:28,594
[SPEAKER_12]: I think in our city, we're extremely fortunate to have people like Tim heading up departments.

1499
01:54:28,654 --> 01:54:33,097
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess, I think that was back when it was the DPW and now engineering, I got it mixed up.

1500
01:54:33,157 --> 01:54:33,917
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry about that, Tim.

1501
01:54:34,358 --> 01:54:36,719
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, I stopped by City Hall yesterday.

1502
01:54:36,759 --> 01:54:37,880
[SPEAKER_12]: I was talking to a lot of people.

1503
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:39,901
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a little bit after 4.30.

1504
01:54:39,981 --> 01:54:41,642
[SPEAKER_12]: I went to stop by Tim's office.

1505
01:54:42,263 --> 01:54:43,504
[SPEAKER_12]: People were closing up

1506
01:54:44,645 --> 01:54:46,246
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, it was after 430.

1507
01:54:46,467 --> 01:54:51,192
[SPEAKER_12]: I wasn't able to go in because he's still he's still working after the clock was was over.

1508
01:54:51,212 --> 01:54:52,414
[SPEAKER_12]: He's still he's still at the job.

1509
01:54:52,834 --> 01:55:00,363
[SPEAKER_12]: And I really, really hope that he could get the money as soon as he needs as soon as he needs that money to fix up our city, make our city really

1510
01:55:00,803 --> 01:55:01,444
[SPEAKER_12]: really nice quality.

1511
01:55:01,484 --> 01:55:03,566
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that there are people here that are on the council.

1512
01:55:03,586 --> 01:55:04,486
[SPEAKER_12]: They got the reservations.

1513
01:55:04,907 --> 01:55:07,489
[SPEAKER_12]: It's nothing against him, but they have assorted reasons.

1514
01:55:07,989 --> 01:55:09,871
[SPEAKER_12]: No K P law touched me in a certain way.

1515
01:55:09,891 --> 01:55:11,713
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, K P law this capable of that.

1516
01:55:12,433 --> 01:55:19,379
[SPEAKER_12]: But I mean, I really appreciate what you know, Councilor Collins says and Council bears that perhaps if it's gonna be held up for just one session.

1517
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:20,520
[SPEAKER_12]: That's great.

1518
01:55:20,821 --> 01:55:21,301
[SPEAKER_12]: That's great.

1519
01:55:21,401 --> 01:55:25,405
[SPEAKER_12]: But let's let's at least give departments the money they need to work for our city.

1520
01:55:25,925 --> 01:55:32,850
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's an orthogonal issue, and that's this whole KP law, KP law that's going on every session.

1521
01:55:32,910 --> 01:55:36,473
[SPEAKER_12]: People will say, I'm sorry to repeat myself, but I have to repeat myself one more time.

1522
01:55:37,013 --> 01:55:44,839
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I start wondering, why is it the council has so much difficulty thinking outside of the box about how to get an answer?

1523
01:55:45,159 --> 01:55:47,681
[SPEAKER_12]: Because in my experience in this city, when people want to do things,

1524
01:55:48,061 --> 01:55:51,603
[SPEAKER_12]: They get the answer immediately, even when it's a mayor that's not responsive.

1525
01:55:51,984 --> 01:55:58,908
[SPEAKER_12]: All it takes is some mobilizing and some people that are leaders that know how to do the mobilizing, and they say, let's get an answer from the mayor.

1526
01:55:59,269 --> 01:56:01,230
[SPEAKER_12]: I really think it may be time.

1527
01:56:02,213 --> 01:56:07,334
[SPEAKER_12]: for the council to start thinking outside of the box, how will we get an answer?

1528
01:56:07,735 --> 01:56:18,017
[SPEAKER_12]: Because if anybody needs my help, just tell me, just tell me, I can call the mayor, what is the answer about KP law and be done with this silly, you know, Benghazi KP law.

1529
01:56:18,057 --> 01:56:20,038
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm always wondering where did KP law touch you?

1530
01:56:20,498 --> 01:56:24,919
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, so just let, let me know if we need to get an answer because there's going on and on and on and on.

1531
01:56:25,619 --> 01:56:27,020
[SPEAKER_12]: It's holding up the city.

1532
01:56:27,700 --> 01:56:31,421
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, madam president.

1533
01:56:34,605 --> 01:56:35,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1534
01:56:35,446 --> 01:56:36,487
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Madam President.

1535
01:56:36,527 --> 01:56:38,388
[SPEAKER_15]: So I appreciate Mr. Lieberman.

1536
01:56:38,448 --> 01:56:43,652
[SPEAKER_15]: He's been very active and involved in our community, and he makes a lot of sense at times.

1537
01:56:44,153 --> 01:56:55,802
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think when we're talking about money papers, I think for one, Councilor, KP law is an issue because we've made mistakes because we don't have legal representation supporting this council.

1538
01:56:55,862 --> 01:57:01,747
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've been left out in the cold on some serious legal issues that cost us a lot of money.

1539
01:57:02,127 --> 01:57:02,587
[SPEAKER_15]: That's one.

1540
01:57:04,301 --> 01:57:12,924
[SPEAKER_15]: My respect for Tim and what they're doing, it can't be, it's not questioned.

1541
01:57:13,004 --> 01:57:19,026
[SPEAKER_15]: He is amazing, what they're doing there is amazing, but the problem we're having is understanding.

1542
01:57:19,126 --> 01:57:25,669
[SPEAKER_15]: I know we had our financial paperwork here the other day, financial director here, and he presented some sort of paperwork.

1543
01:57:26,089 --> 01:57:30,671
[SPEAKER_15]: We still don't see where we are financially in our community.

1544
01:57:31,531 --> 01:57:35,133
[SPEAKER_15]: So bonding and keep spending money, not understanding where we are.

1545
01:57:35,674 --> 01:57:38,516
[SPEAKER_15]: It sounds great today and I think it's out of the box and let's do it.

1546
01:57:38,536 --> 01:57:39,016
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's do it.

1547
01:57:39,336 --> 01:57:39,977
[SPEAKER_15]: And we do it.

1548
01:57:40,397 --> 01:57:42,859
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we come to me and say, guess what?

1549
01:57:44,229 --> 01:57:47,671
[SPEAKER_15]: We didn't know the financial outlook, but this is what it is today now.

1550
01:57:48,311 --> 01:57:57,617
[SPEAKER_15]: We now have to go to Tim and say, Tim, you have that great equipment we just purchased, but now they're gonna turn into planters, because now we have to lay off 10 DPW employees.

1551
01:57:58,077 --> 01:58:02,640
[SPEAKER_15]: This is my fear of where we were last year, last May and June.

1552
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:11,445
[SPEAKER_15]: Don't forget where we were, that at one in the morning, the mayor had to come back from home and try to figure out a way to give us, find us $12 million.

1553
01:58:12,947 --> 01:58:14,087
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's all I'm saying.

1554
01:58:15,208 --> 01:58:17,369
[SPEAKER_15]: We know the issues we have in the city.

1555
01:58:17,829 --> 01:58:24,572
[SPEAKER_15]: We see it every day and we appreciate directors like Tim that are working their tail off and trying to do the best they can.

1556
01:58:25,132 --> 01:58:40,478
[SPEAKER_15]: But for one council that represents everybody in the city of Medford financially, if we don't see the paperwork in front of us, we don't see the numbers in front of us, no matter what was presented last week, because that's a great start, but it's March.

1557
01:58:42,236 --> 01:58:42,896
[SPEAKER_15]: It's March.

1558
01:58:44,897 --> 01:58:45,237
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1559
01:58:47,458 --> 01:58:48,298
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1560
01:58:48,318 --> 01:58:50,319
[SPEAKER_05]: Name and address for the record, please.

1561
01:58:50,339 --> 01:58:53,580
[SPEAKER_16]: William Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1562
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:59,482
[SPEAKER_16]: I sort of have a question about the procedure here and all that.

1563
01:59:00,002 --> 01:59:06,904
[SPEAKER_16]: If city council is unhappy with the notion that under rule 30,

1564
01:59:10,851 --> 01:59:31,040
[SPEAKER_16]: KP law is they don't want they don't want to acknowledge the fiction that KP law is the city solicitor acting city solicitor, and they want you know a natural person to be to be that city solicitor rule 30 is Council's own rule Council vote to rule this out of order for rule 30, and rather than wait for attorney general, there's rule 30 and then there's a separate ordinance around.

1565
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:32,941
[SPEAKER_05]: establishing the position.

1566
01:59:32,981 --> 01:59:34,841
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a good point.

1567
01:59:35,021 --> 01:59:43,645
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can strike down rule 30 and that would solve maybe this paper, but it wouldn't, there's another ordinance that I think is worth some of the questions.

1568
01:59:43,665 --> 01:59:46,306
[SPEAKER_16]: Fair enough, but you can do both too, right?

1569
01:59:46,666 --> 01:59:50,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, in theory.

1570
01:59:50,307 --> 01:59:54,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we should amend the charter so the council appoints a city solicitor, but that's just my thoughts.

1571
01:59:54,649 --> 01:59:57,290
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, let's see what happens first.

1572
02:00:03,463 --> 02:00:17,249
[SPEAKER_16]: I just say, rather than wait to deal with this paper till you get back from the Attorney General, you could just say, City Council doesn't like this arrangement, we're not doing this, you know, let's get it sorted.

1573
02:00:20,731 --> 02:00:25,353
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, okay, well that's fair enough to point of information, Madam President.

1574
02:00:27,405 --> 02:00:30,147
[SPEAKER_02]: We did say that during the budget hearings that we didn't like the setup.

1575
02:00:30,408 --> 02:00:37,033
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we agreed to pass a budget when the mayor said that she was going to provide us with an assistant city solicitor that works in the building for the city council.

1576
02:00:40,676 --> 02:00:40,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1577
02:00:41,256 --> 02:00:42,237
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1578
02:00:42,958 --> 02:00:51,585
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President, just because I think we have kind of three prongs of things here now on the table and we should move forward as best we can.

1579
02:00:54,984 --> 02:01:03,531
[SPEAKER_06]: One is Councilor Knight saying that he wants the Attorney General's office to review whether this is acceptable relative to our city ordinances.

1580
02:01:04,371 --> 02:01:13,878
[SPEAKER_06]: The second is something that I brought up, which is if the mayor could state whether or not in her view, KP Law is functioning as the acting city solicitor for the city of Medford.

1581
02:01:14,659 --> 02:01:22,065
[SPEAKER_06]: And the third thing Councilor Collins brought up is an update on the hiring process for the city solicitor, the assistant city solicitor.

1582
02:01:23,777 --> 02:01:25,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for presenting back promotions.

1583
02:01:25,639 --> 02:01:26,959
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to, is that right?

1584
02:01:27,420 --> 02:01:28,120
[SPEAKER_05]: That is what I have.

1585
02:01:28,140 --> 02:01:34,244
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I was going to address.

1586
02:01:34,264 --> 02:01:35,765
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1587
02:01:35,825 --> 02:01:40,948
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just, I'm trying to not, not trying to fill in for you at all.

1588
02:01:41,008 --> 02:01:46,892
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam president, just, I was just looking up very quickly.

1589
02:01:46,912 --> 02:01:49,634
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a municipal law bureau at the attorney general's office.

1590
02:01:51,468 --> 02:02:13,746
[SPEAKER_06]: relative to those ideas, if everyone who proposed those three different ideas would be comfortable, can we move to table this for one meeting till March 14th, request that the city clerk call the Municipal Law Bureau at the Attorney General's office tomorrow or this week and request that review that Councilor Knight asked for, or ask what the process would be for that.

1591
02:02:15,351 --> 02:02:21,192
[SPEAKER_06]: and then also ask that the administration get back to us in 10 days around my question and Councilor Collins' question.

1592
02:02:21,412 --> 02:02:27,054
[SPEAKER_06]: And then in two weeks, we will have some sort of response back from the Attorney General.

1593
02:02:27,074 --> 02:02:29,034
[SPEAKER_06]: It may not be a full response.

1594
02:02:29,094 --> 02:02:34,035
[SPEAKER_06]: It may say, this is the process you need to go through to get us to do this, or we don't do this, or whatever else it may be.

1595
02:02:34,655 --> 02:02:41,977
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just wanted to put some timelines and a shock box on the whole thing, because I agree we need the right answer, but I also agree that we should try to move as fast as we can.

1596
02:02:44,455 --> 02:02:47,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that make sense to everybody, the three folks who proposed motions?

1597
02:02:47,696 --> 02:02:49,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean, I think Councilor Knight has the original motion.

1598
02:02:49,716 --> 02:02:51,296
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there's debate about the other motions.

1599
02:02:51,356 --> 02:02:57,597
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Councilor Knight, the proposed changes from Vice President Bears around the original motion, is that something you'd be amenable to?

1600
02:02:58,478 --> 02:02:59,238
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not a big deal.

1601
02:03:00,178 --> 02:03:00,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1602
02:03:01,138 --> 02:03:03,679
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think there's any debate around the other motions, so.

1603
02:03:04,739 --> 02:03:07,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion, keep them all together, we can vote them as one package.

1604
02:03:07,339 --> 02:03:11,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we have a motion from Councilor Knight to combine those three motions.

1605
02:03:13,425 --> 02:03:15,006
[SPEAKER_02]: approval as amended.

1606
02:03:15,106 --> 02:03:15,346
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1607
02:03:16,047 --> 02:03:16,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we have.

1608
02:03:18,508 --> 02:03:22,111
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a motion from Council tonight to combine all three motions as amended.

1609
02:03:22,971 --> 02:03:23,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1610
02:03:23,472 --> 02:03:29,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone understands three motions are before us we have the table to a date certain have the clerk, reach out to the AP.

1611
02:03:30,276 --> 02:03:32,377
[SPEAKER_05]: We have Collins.

1612
02:03:35,639 --> 02:03:36,640
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not approving the paper.

1613
02:03:36,780 --> 02:03:40,923
[SPEAKER_05]: We're tabling and then we have a number of

1614
02:03:41,997 --> 02:03:42,437
[SPEAKER_05]: motions.

1615
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:54,389
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins is asking for their opinion on whether or not keeping the laws acting as a state solicitor.

1616
02:03:54,929 --> 02:03:55,370
[SPEAKER_05]: That's you.

1617
02:03:56,070 --> 02:03:57,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Hiring update.

1618
02:03:57,151 --> 02:03:57,592
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1619
02:04:07,287 --> 02:04:12,074
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1620
02:04:14,137 --> 02:04:16,180
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the table and those other actions.

1621
02:04:16,220 --> 02:04:18,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Table to a date, sir, and the other actions.

1622
02:04:22,709 --> 02:04:24,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam President, we're into suspension.

1623
02:04:25,742 --> 02:04:28,184
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to vote but go ahead.

1624
02:04:28,204 --> 02:04:44,694
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have paper 23057 which is really similar subject matter, and that circumstance we had an opinion from the acting city solicitor at the time was in house in our city solicitor will give us an opinion relative to the way that these promotional advancements and salary increases should be implemented.

1625
02:04:45,034 --> 02:04:48,156
[SPEAKER_02]: We then received an opinion from KP law and then a revised opinion from KP law.

1626
02:04:48,776 --> 02:04:52,079
[SPEAKER_02]: again, KP Lawyers stated that they're not the city's attorney, they're the mayor's private attorney.

1627
02:04:52,479 --> 02:04:56,542
[SPEAKER_02]: They've given us two contrary legal opinions to the standing and acting legal city solicitor at the time.

1628
02:04:57,343 --> 02:05:00,685
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we're kind of in the same circumstance with this paper that we were in the others.

1629
02:05:01,446 --> 02:05:04,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, we're gonna go on this paper first.

1630
02:05:07,390 --> 02:05:08,010
[SPEAKER_09]: Please call the roll.

1631
02:05:09,752 --> 02:05:09,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1632
02:05:12,033 --> 02:05:12,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1633
02:05:13,715 --> 02:05:13,895
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1634
02:05:16,277 --> 02:05:16,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1635
02:05:25,177 --> 02:05:27,658
[SPEAKER_05]: unless the conflict of interest is what their rules say.

1636
02:05:29,800 --> 02:05:30,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1637
02:05:33,982 --> 02:05:34,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1638
02:05:35,563 --> 02:05:35,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1639
02:05:35,803 --> 02:05:37,304
[SPEAKER_05]: 7 in front of zero negative motion.

1640
02:05:37,564 --> 02:05:38,184
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1641
02:05:38,284 --> 02:05:42,267
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to table passes.

1642
02:05:42,287 --> 02:05:51,812
[SPEAKER_05]: 23-057 to Honorable President Morell and members of the Medford City Council regarding request to establish the traffic and transportation director position in the city's classification compensation plan resubmitted

1643
02:05:52,298 --> 02:06:11,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Dear President Morell and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that the City Council approve the following amendment to the revised ordinances, chapter 66, entitled personnel, article two, entitled reserve, the city's classification and compensation plan, formally included as article two, sections 66-31 through 66-40, by adopting the following language change.

1644
02:06:12,416 --> 02:06:17,881
[SPEAKER_05]: The language of PW 2022 shall be amended to include the following position, traffic and transportation director,

1645
02:06:18,504 --> 02:06:29,752
[SPEAKER_05]: traffic and transportation director position is filled by a current staff member who took on a new role with additional responsibilities and was included in the FY 22 and 23 budgets but the title has not been added to the city's classification and compensation plan.

1646
02:06:30,193 --> 02:06:36,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Based on the October 20, 2022 KP law memo, personal ordinance amendments dash quantum of vote requirement end quote,

1647
02:06:37,574 --> 02:06:47,579
[SPEAKER_05]: It is our revised opinion that this classification requires four votes under general laws, chapter 44, section 33A, along with a supplemental appropriation for which we have submitted an associated paper.

1648
02:06:47,919 --> 02:06:51,880
[SPEAKER_05]: Chief of staff, Ian Nazarian, is available to speak to this request and answer any questions you may have.

1649
02:06:52,301 --> 02:06:53,661
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

1650
02:06:53,721 --> 02:06:54,442
[SPEAKER_05]: Respectfully submitted.

1651
02:06:54,462 --> 02:06:55,442
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna allow the current mayor.

1652
02:06:57,563 --> 02:06:58,603
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight, would you like to continue?

1653
02:06:58,623 --> 02:06:59,664
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have anything else you'd like to add?

1654
02:06:59,924 --> 02:07:01,545
[SPEAKER_03]: No, as previously stated, Madam President.

1655
02:07:02,245 --> 02:07:03,586
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the gentleman's doing great work, though.

1656
02:07:03,606 --> 02:07:04,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong.

1657
02:07:07,188 --> 02:07:10,616
[SPEAKER_05]: thinks the gentleman is doing great work don't get him wrong.

1658
02:07:11,839 --> 02:07:15,446
[SPEAKER_06]: Any members of the Council wish to speak, I'm happy to hear from them first.

1659
02:07:18,789 --> 02:07:18,989
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1660
02:07:19,890 --> 02:07:25,055
[SPEAKER_08]: I just I'm here to say that this is the letters, I think, say exactly what we're here for.

1661
02:07:25,115 --> 02:07:34,784
[SPEAKER_08]: But I will say that this was part of the strategy strategy multiple years ago to have a director of traffic and transportation position in the city.

1662
02:07:35,905 --> 02:07:43,452
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we all agree that it's been a very valuable thing for the city to have traffic and transportation engineers on staff at the engineering office.

1663
02:07:44,052 --> 02:07:49,396
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe that the value that they have added to the city is tremendous.

1664
02:07:49,456 --> 02:07:56,541
[SPEAKER_08]: So the step to make it, to make that a director level position, I think is a critical step for the city.

1665
02:07:58,062 --> 02:08:02,545
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we can continue to provide that service that I believe the city needs.

1666
02:08:02,845 --> 02:08:06,147
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully this finds its way to passage.

1667
02:08:06,567 --> 02:08:07,448
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you very much.

1668
02:08:07,748 --> 02:08:08,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1669
02:08:09,449 --> 02:08:10,050
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Scarpa.

1670
02:08:10,310 --> 02:08:11,851
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, Madam President, again, I don't,

1671
02:08:13,112 --> 02:08:21,198
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, it's not that I don't support, uh, traffic, uh, engineer.

1672
02:08:21,238 --> 02:08:23,140
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that he does an amazing job.

1673
02:08:23,180 --> 02:08:28,063
[SPEAKER_15]: But again, I think that there's too many questions still haven't been asked or answered.

1674
02:08:28,544 --> 02:08:33,087
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, when we've sent that out, I reiterate what Councilor Knight said.

1675
02:08:33,828 --> 02:08:41,654
[SPEAKER_15]: Our city solicitor said that there were some concerns with the process and agreed with this council.

1676
02:08:42,441 --> 02:08:49,303
[SPEAKER_15]: And then, again, we get contradictory feedback from KP Law, so I'm left in limbo.

1677
02:08:49,543 --> 02:08:56,885
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think that we can move forward with any of these caps or increases or change of salaries.

1678
02:08:57,465 --> 02:08:59,106
[SPEAKER_15]: Although, do I think it deserves it?

1679
02:08:59,186 --> 02:09:10,729
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely, but it's also, what we're seeing is you have other departments that people are picking up duties

1680
02:09:11,502 --> 02:09:12,763
[SPEAKER_15]: and not being compensated.

1681
02:09:13,103 --> 02:09:25,452
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll give you an example of the veteran director who was put into position back in the day when he was the hearing officer and he was waiting to be compensated.

1682
02:09:25,812 --> 02:09:31,336
[SPEAKER_15]: And don't forget that day because people that were here remember the injustice there.

1683
02:09:31,396 --> 02:09:33,978
[SPEAKER_15]: So here we are now in the same situation.

1684
02:09:34,058 --> 02:09:38,301
[SPEAKER_15]: So this isn't how business works in the municipality.

1685
02:09:38,921 --> 02:09:40,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Although as much as I like

1686
02:09:41,087 --> 02:09:41,647
[SPEAKER_15]: the director.

1687
02:09:41,667 --> 02:09:44,168
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't you can't be picking and choosing.

1688
02:09:44,228 --> 02:09:45,449
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's a slippery slope.

1689
02:09:45,989 --> 02:09:56,273
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, this is why, you know, not having having a conflicting legal, um, representation is a huge problem.

1690
02:09:56,694 --> 02:09:59,255
[SPEAKER_15]: So I won't be able to support this.

1691
02:09:59,275 --> 02:09:59,715
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1692
02:10:00,775 --> 02:10:01,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1693
02:10:01,776 --> 02:10:03,877
[SPEAKER_06]: I respect my colleagues positions on this.

1694
02:10:03,917 --> 02:10:04,157
[SPEAKER_06]: I think

1695
02:10:05,452 --> 02:10:06,533
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been a number of issues.

1696
02:10:06,653 --> 02:10:16,561
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that maybe the chain of events and the opinions are getting a little bit conflated, but I, again, I respect my fellow councilors positions.

1697
02:10:18,083 --> 02:10:26,129
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, the way that this is presented tonight, it's very clear that a new position in the city does not exist until it is approved in the cap.

1698
02:10:26,289 --> 02:10:33,015
[SPEAKER_06]: This is presented as a new position to be added to the cap, which did not exist prior to any action that we take on this.

1699
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:48,539
[SPEAKER_06]: We did receive legal advice from KP Law, a memorandum from KP Law around these issues, clearly delineating the requirements of Chapter 44, Section 33A.

1700
02:10:49,500 --> 02:10:51,102
[SPEAKER_06]: And when it comes to creating a new position,

1701
02:10:52,929 --> 02:10:53,950
[SPEAKER_06]: that requires four votes.

1702
02:10:55,450 --> 02:10:58,391
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's something else, there's other requirements.

1703
02:10:59,212 --> 02:11:07,555
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is, I think, to me, very similar to the senior planner position that was created by this council and amended to the CAF in late last year.

1704
02:11:07,575 --> 02:11:13,518
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also think, and I'm just gonna say what I said at that meeting,

1705
02:11:16,704 --> 02:11:20,971
[SPEAKER_06]: The work that we do here is a balancing of interests and a balancing of what's best for the city.

1706
02:11:20,991 --> 02:11:26,559
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally feel confident on this paper and the legal justification behind it.

1707
02:11:27,561 --> 02:11:28,542
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also feel that.

1708
02:11:30,649 --> 02:11:49,381
[SPEAKER_06]: this person that the creation of a traffic and transportation director, and making sure that a person who fills that role has the multiple years of experience with the city that the person who would, you know, likely be taking the role has is essential, and we know that there are

1709
02:11:51,002 --> 02:11:54,465
[SPEAKER_06]: not enough experts to fill too many open jobs.

1710
02:11:54,625 --> 02:12:11,398
[SPEAKER_06]: There are other communities, there are state agencies that are looking for people with the expertise of this position and that's why I personally am going to support this tonight because I want to make sure that this city

1711
02:12:13,834 --> 02:12:19,781
[SPEAKER_06]: that we as a city council are making sure that the city has the staff and tools that the city needs to be successful.

1712
02:12:20,782 --> 02:12:24,026
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's my reasoning.

1713
02:12:24,086 --> 02:12:25,268
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you, Madam President.

1714
02:12:25,708 --> 02:12:27,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Collins and Councilor Tseng.

1715
02:12:28,852 --> 02:12:29,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Morell.

1716
02:12:36,704 --> 02:12:44,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate my federal counselors sharing their thoughts about this, and I appreciate that it is kind of in conversation with the previous paper.

1717
02:12:44,449 --> 02:12:57,336
[SPEAKER_04]: I will be supporting this tonight, and like I said on the previous paper about the loan order, I would have been comfortable going forward with that paper.

1718
02:12:57,417 --> 02:13:04,421
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we heard from the expert in the room that it's not gonna be catastrophic to wait on that for two weeks, so I was comfortable with that middle ground.

1719
02:13:05,792 --> 02:13:15,236
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also said, I think every council has to make their own decision about, you know, what tactics to use and where we feel comfortable drawing a line in the sand.

1720
02:13:15,536 --> 02:13:18,477
[SPEAKER_04]: And as Mr. Bears put it, weighing those balances.

1721
02:13:21,398 --> 02:13:26,200
[SPEAKER_04]: As every project that comes before us is important to the functioning of the city in some way.

1722
02:13:27,661 --> 02:13:30,842
[SPEAKER_04]: My understanding, this is the first reading anyway, and we know that we're getting that legal opinion.

1723
02:13:34,071 --> 02:13:37,114
[SPEAKER_04]: And this, the creation of this position I think is very overdue.

1724
02:13:37,134 --> 02:13:55,511
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very important to the city it's important to me, the D the, you know, acting traffic and transportation director person currently in that role once it's codified I think is one of the experts in the city that I've turned to the most of the city councilor on the incredibly responsive it helped me out was scores of

1725
02:13:56,377 --> 02:14:01,499
[SPEAKER_04]: constituent problems and complaints and questions over the past 14 months.

1726
02:14:01,659 --> 02:14:16,583
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just think that the creation of this position is critical to where we are as a city today in the 21st century with just the sheer amount of traffic and transportation related projects and problems that come across my email inbox.

1727
02:14:17,824 --> 02:14:22,685
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a motion that I'm personally not willing to wait for.

1728
02:14:22,705 --> 02:14:25,546
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'll be voicing my support tonight,

1729
02:14:26,530 --> 02:14:29,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, my fellow counselors for listening to my explanation.

1730
02:14:29,652 --> 02:14:31,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1731
02:14:31,473 --> 02:14:32,473
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Burrell.

1732
02:14:33,153 --> 02:14:36,875
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear my fellow colleagues and their different viewpoints on this issue.

1733
02:14:38,576 --> 02:14:46,340
[SPEAKER_07]: I, however, do plan to vote yes on this because, as for the same reasons, Councilor Bears has elaborated.

1734
02:14:48,434 --> 02:14:50,356
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe the legal reasoning is pretty sound here.

1735
02:14:50,396 --> 02:14:51,097
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty clear.

1736
02:14:51,197 --> 02:14:52,819
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been through this before.

1737
02:14:53,620 --> 02:14:58,665
[SPEAKER_07]: We've talked about this exact procedure before, and it is a new position.

1738
02:15:00,007 --> 02:15:06,494
[SPEAKER_07]: When I approach a vote like this, I also think about what the practical everyday effects are.

1739
02:15:07,275 --> 02:15:16,130
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do fear, as, as we, you know, we're always talking about the difficulty of hiring city staff and the difficulty of retaining city staff.

1740
02:15:19,909 --> 02:15:26,334
[SPEAKER_07]: that we would lose staff to different communities that are willing to pay more to the state agencies who are willing to pay more.

1741
02:15:27,055 --> 02:15:44,409
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think this role is so vital to the everyday functioning of our city and as Councilor Collins referred to the constituents requests for their city government to serve them.

1742
02:15:45,310 --> 02:15:45,450
[SPEAKER_07]: And

1743
02:15:46,591 --> 02:15:51,856
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, I just believe that we would be severely harmed if we don't move forward with this.

1744
02:15:52,677 --> 02:15:54,659
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah.

1745
02:15:55,320 --> 02:15:58,903
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1746
02:15:58,944 --> 02:15:59,264
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1747
02:15:59,884 --> 02:16:05,810
[SPEAKER_15]: I just just to be clear, I appreciate these comments and I think that that's what's great about this forum.

1748
02:16:06,211 --> 02:16:07,072
[SPEAKER_15]: But again, this is

1749
02:16:09,542 --> 02:16:19,694
[SPEAKER_15]: as 23-057 then leads off to 23-058 and that's gonna talk about the differential in the salary.

1750
02:16:20,595 --> 02:16:23,318
[SPEAKER_15]: I want us all to look at that and realize that

1751
02:16:24,076 --> 02:16:30,940
[SPEAKER_15]: does, because it seems to me that we're going to be losing a union position and all of us here are union supporters, correct?

1752
02:16:31,580 --> 02:16:44,708
[SPEAKER_15]: This compensation for what reads in the next resolution, the increase of the funding using salaries would be funded because of a highway salaries account due to temporary vacancies in the senior clerk position.

1753
02:16:45,409 --> 02:16:48,571
[SPEAKER_15]: So does that mean that we're losing the senior clerk position to fund this position?

1754
02:16:50,792 --> 02:16:50,892
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1755
02:16:51,974 --> 02:16:53,075
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1756
02:16:53,095 --> 02:16:54,016
[SPEAKER_15]: So what does that mean?

1757
02:16:54,357 --> 02:16:56,900
[SPEAKER_15]: Just for clarification purposes.

1758
02:16:56,920 --> 02:17:00,123
[SPEAKER_15]: So when this person does come back, Tim, we're gonna hire this person back full salary?

1759
02:17:01,025 --> 02:17:04,609
[SPEAKER_15]: And then how are we gonna pay this position if that money's being used somewhere else?

1760
02:17:06,069 --> 02:17:10,611
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't have an answer to that question, but I know that I haven't agreed to any losing any position.

1761
02:17:10,691 --> 02:17:14,072
[SPEAKER_08]: So my full understanding is that we wouldn't be losing any position.

1762
02:17:14,092 --> 02:17:18,674
[SPEAKER_15]: Chief of staff Nazarian here, just because that's something that's important before I vote.

1763
02:17:18,934 --> 02:17:27,738
[SPEAKER_15]: If you look for both papers together, this is approving something that is still questionable because of not understanding the true legal separation of two different parties.

1764
02:17:28,178 --> 02:17:31,519
[SPEAKER_15]: But then the next page talks about the funding of that position.

1765
02:17:32,080 --> 02:17:35,001
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's looks like eliminating a union position.

1766
02:17:35,672 --> 02:17:37,454
[SPEAKER_15]: So is Chief of Staff here?

1767
02:17:37,474 --> 02:17:38,715
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Chief of Staff's not on the call.

1768
02:17:38,775 --> 02:17:39,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's good.

1769
02:17:39,215 --> 02:17:40,276
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why she's not on the call.

1770
02:17:40,316 --> 02:17:41,417
[SPEAKER_15]: She did say she was, though, right?

1771
02:17:41,437 --> 02:17:44,679
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I don't know why she's not on the call.

1772
02:17:44,699 --> 02:17:46,741
[SPEAKER_08]: I can speak to it a little bit, Madam President.

1773
02:17:47,181 --> 02:17:55,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Just that not having the senior clerk accrued some value in that particular line to cover the increase for this year.

1774
02:17:56,028 --> 02:18:01,073
[SPEAKER_08]: So I believe it would need to be presented to you in a budget for following years after the creation of the CAF.

1775
02:18:01,813 --> 02:18:03,975
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there someone in that position now, or does it remain vacant?

1776
02:18:05,517 --> 02:18:09,561
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe we have all of our clerk positions filled in DPW right now.

1777
02:18:09,621 --> 02:18:11,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so it was a past vacancy that's been filled?

1778
02:18:12,043 --> 02:18:12,444
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

1779
02:18:12,704 --> 02:18:16,027
[SPEAKER_08]: So all of our clerk positions are filled at the moment.

1780
02:18:16,508 --> 02:18:16,848
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1781
02:18:17,909 --> 02:18:18,810
[SPEAKER_15]: If I can, just...

1782
02:18:19,906 --> 02:18:28,090
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the increase the funding using the salaries of funded curve, the DPW salaries account due to a temporary vacancy and the senior clerk's position.

1783
02:18:28,170 --> 02:18:30,512
[SPEAKER_15]: That person is now, they hired the person now?

1784
02:18:31,312 --> 02:18:32,673
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a vacancies back?

1785
02:18:32,953 --> 02:18:33,293
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1786
02:18:33,713 --> 02:18:34,434
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, thank you.

1787
02:18:34,874 --> 02:18:36,015

1788
02:18:36,855 --> 02:18:37,916
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1789
02:18:37,976 --> 02:18:40,417
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd move to approve this paper for first reading.

1790
02:18:41,337 --> 02:18:44,139
[SPEAKER_05]: I do see Councilor Caraviello.

1791
02:18:44,279 --> 02:18:45,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if he's coming back.

1792
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:45,920
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see him out there.

1793
02:18:46,060 --> 02:18:47,741
[SPEAKER_05]: He wants to vote on that.

1794
02:18:49,807 --> 02:18:59,189
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and the other thing I would just say is I do believe the traffic and transportation director and the position was included in the new unit of management positions that was organized by level 25.

1795
02:18:59,369 --> 02:19:01,729
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't believe there'll be a loss of the union position.

1796
02:19:02,350 --> 02:19:04,510
[SPEAKER_15]: Just clarify that.

1797

02:28:03,510 --> 02:28:11,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I mean if I was in a motion passes back to the regular order of business records the records from February 14 2023 were passed your counselor saying counselor saying how did you find them.

1921
02:28:15,860 --> 02:28:21,963
[SPEAKER_06]: I found them in order, but I was just going to move to approve the records and all the reports of committees in one vote.

1922
02:28:22,323 --> 02:28:23,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1923
02:28:24,124 --> 02:28:26,025
[SPEAKER_05]: Does anyone need a refresher on the reports of committees or?

1924
02:28:26,645 --> 02:28:26,845
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1925
02:28:27,025 --> 02:28:36,049
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of Councilor Tseng, no, on the motion of Vice President Bears, seconded by Councilor Knight to approve the records and all reports of committees.

1926
02:28:36,549 --> 02:28:38,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, it's plural.

1927
02:28:38,290 --> 02:28:40,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Bears.

1928
02:28:45,472 --> 02:28:47,313
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1929
02:28:47,813 --> 02:28:49,934
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1930
02:28:51,916 --> 02:29:04,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, seven the affirmative zero negative motion passes to three dash zero four, sorry to three dash zero four six offered by Council night be it so resolved the city administration take the necessary steps to register and garage the parking enforcement vehicles in the city of Medford.

1931
02:29:06,088 --> 02:29:13,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Madam President, it's been brought to my attention that parking enforcement vehicles aren't garage in the state, even nevermind the city of Medford.

1932
02:29:13,638 --> 02:29:21,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen the vehicles driving around town with the nice fancy city of Medford sticker on it says parking enforcement on it, parking enforcement officers are in it but other vehicles.

1933
02:29:22,229 --> 02:29:25,932
[SPEAKER_02]: are not registered in the state of Massachusetts or in the city of Medford.

1934
02:29:26,773 --> 02:29:39,943
[SPEAKER_02]: So I believe that was a criteria in our previous contract with Republic Parking, and I see no reason why these vehicles shouldn't be both garaged and insured in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, nevermind the city of Medford.

1935
02:29:41,404 --> 02:29:42,045
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor.

1936
02:29:42,105 --> 02:29:47,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Leaving City Hall last week, I did see a parking vehicle with a Connecticut license plate, so I can't affirm this is.

1937
02:29:48,243 --> 02:29:50,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Something that has not yet happened, at least as of last week.

1938
02:29:51,726 --> 02:29:52,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion from the council?

1939
02:29:54,748 --> 02:29:57,070
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Bears.

1940
02:29:57,110 --> 02:29:58,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1941
02:30:02,354 --> 02:30:02,555
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1942
02:30:03,756 --> 02:30:05,217
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1943
02:30:05,877 --> 02:30:06,198
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1944
02:30:08,139 --> 02:30:09,740
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1945
02:30:09,780 --> 02:30:10,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1946
02:30:11,062 --> 02:30:11,262
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1947
02:30:11,462 --> 02:30:12,763
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven affirmative, zero negative.

1948
02:30:12,783 --> 02:30:13,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion passes.

1949
02:30:14,381 --> 02:30:24,489
[SPEAKER_05]: 23 dash 047 offered by Councilor Knight, be it so resolved the city administration take the necessary steps to restore the damages to the waterfront abutting the Hormel community, sorry, Hormel Stadium community gardens.

1950
02:30:25,050 --> 02:30:36,979
[SPEAKER_05]: As a result of unauthorized clear cutting of trees brush bushes and other natural growth along the waterline, and be it further resolved the tree warden representative from the Conservation Commission and a representative from the Community Garden Commission perform a site visit.

1951
02:30:37,526 --> 02:30:49,594
[SPEAKER_05]: and report back to the council the extent of the damages and an estimated cost of restoration and be it further resolved that the assistance of the Mystic River Watershed Association be requested to ensure restoration is in coordination with their master plan.

1952
02:30:49,915 --> 02:30:50,335
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

1953
02:30:51,567 --> 02:30:53,829
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty good, all in one breath, Madam President.

1954
02:30:53,909 --> 02:30:54,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.

1955
02:30:54,689 --> 02:31:07,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, ultimately, it's been brought to my attention that there's been some unauthorized clear-cutting of forestry between the community garden and the dog park, say, going down to the waterfront over by Homel Stadium.

1956
02:31:07,859 --> 02:31:10,200
[SPEAKER_02]: It's caused a little bit of disruption to our ecosystem.

1957
02:31:11,081 --> 02:31:15,404
[SPEAKER_02]: The matter has been brought to the attention of the Office of Energy and Environment.

1958
02:31:15,684 --> 02:31:19,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Dennis McDougal has been involved in the

1959
02:31:20,825 --> 02:31:22,806
[SPEAKER_02]: examination and restoration of the area.

1960
02:31:22,826 --> 02:31:50,503
[SPEAKER_02]: The police department has also been contacted relative to the circumstances, but the clear-cutting persists, Madam President, so this is something that I'm hoping we can get ahead of, take a look at, maybe do some intervention, educate some people in the community about the dangers of clear-cutting forestry, especially abutting the Mystic River watershed, and maybe move forward and restore some of the damage that has been done to further beautify the area that's utilized by so many in this community.

1961
02:31:52,056 --> 02:31:52,736
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1962
02:31:52,816 --> 02:31:53,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Bears.

1963
02:31:53,557 --> 02:31:54,697
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

1964
02:31:55,017 --> 02:32:00,779
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you're on your way out the door, Commissioner McGibbert, but have you heard about this?

1965
02:32:00,859 --> 02:32:02,580
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know anything about this?

1966
02:32:02,680 --> 02:32:05,741
[SPEAKER_06]: And or Councilor Knight, could you further say who's doing the clearcutting?

1967
02:32:08,122 --> 02:32:09,062
[SPEAKER_03]: That I do not know.

1968
02:32:09,082 --> 02:32:09,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1969
02:32:17,878 --> 02:32:30,170
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess an enforcement order, I believe it's what it's called, was issued by the Conservation Commission to one person for just that clearing brush that's protected under the Wellands Protection Act.

1970
02:32:30,210 --> 02:32:30,911
[SPEAKER_08]: It's near a river.

1971
02:32:31,932 --> 02:32:34,254
[SPEAKER_08]: I believe the activity has come to an end.

1972
02:32:34,294 --> 02:32:34,755
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not 100% sure on that.

1973
02:32:36,586 --> 02:32:43,612
[SPEAKER_08]: We also had some volunteer groups, I believe, do some proper maintenance that was approved by DCR.

1974
02:32:44,053 --> 02:32:49,237
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to be clear that that activity was happening as well, but that was legitimate activity.

1975
02:32:49,878 --> 02:32:58,242
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we had this activity by one individual, from what I understand, who was taking it upon himself to take care of our waterfront.

1976
02:32:59,583 --> 02:33:01,624
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's my understanding of the whole situation.

1977
02:33:01,644 --> 02:33:07,287
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, I was just briefed on these issues, so I don't have a full detailed understanding.

1978
02:33:07,607 --> 02:33:08,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Alicia Hunt is still on the call.

1979
02:33:08,707 --> 02:33:09,788
[SPEAKER_05]: She has her hand up as well.

1980
02:33:09,968 --> 02:33:10,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

1981
02:33:11,329 --> 02:33:11,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1982
02:33:11,649 --> 02:33:12,049
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1983
02:33:17,412 --> 02:33:21,254
[SPEAKER_19]: Madam President, yes, actually, Commissioner McGivern got that completely correct.

1984
02:33:22,135 --> 02:33:39,084
[SPEAKER_19]: This was an activity that was occurring last spring and over the summer, and we had a hard time finding it happening to stop it, but a member of the Riverbend Garden did contact our office, let us know when it was actually happening.

1985
02:33:39,104 --> 02:33:45,887
[SPEAKER_19]: Our environmental agent, Dennis McDougal, went down there, spoke with the individual who was

1986
02:33:47,409 --> 02:33:48,250
[SPEAKER_19]: argumentative.

1987
02:33:49,231 --> 02:33:55,157
[SPEAKER_19]: The Conservation Commission issued an enforcement order that he should stop.

1988
02:33:57,340 --> 02:34:00,123
[SPEAKER_19]: We appreciate the help of our police department.

1989
02:34:00,483 --> 02:34:01,865
[SPEAKER_19]: Enforcement orders have to be

1990
02:34:03,800 --> 02:34:06,161
[SPEAKER_19]: You have to sign that you've received it.

1991
02:34:06,201 --> 02:34:07,321
[SPEAKER_19]: There needs to be legal proof.

1992
02:34:08,421 --> 02:34:12,643
[SPEAKER_19]: And so when somebody's issued something like this, they don't always want to sign.

1993
02:34:13,103 --> 02:34:20,485
[SPEAKER_19]: So the police officer was able to verify for us that it was, in fact, delivered by an officer by hand.

1994
02:34:23,686 --> 02:34:29,808
[SPEAKER_19]: We've kept an eye on the area, and there's been no further cutting in that area.

1995
02:34:31,809 --> 02:34:42,166
[SPEAKER_19]: By that individual as the commissioner explained, we did have some organized invasives removing and Vista pruning that occurred.

1996
02:34:42,938 --> 02:34:48,800
[SPEAKER_19]: in the area adjacent to that that was done correctly under the supervision of our tree warden.

1997
02:34:49,800 --> 02:34:56,922
[SPEAKER_19]: We encourage any residents who think that we're not clearing our vistas well enough and removing invasives to come and speak with us.

1998
02:34:57,683 --> 02:35:03,605
[SPEAKER_19]: The Mystic River Watershed Association does organize volunteer vista pruning events.

1999
02:35:04,445 --> 02:35:07,506
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been keeping an eye on the area to determine whether

2000
02:35:08,346 --> 02:35:17,069
[SPEAKER_19]: uh, planting makes sense this spring or whether it'll, um, just fill in appropriately as needed.

2001
02:35:17,089 --> 02:35:23,192
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, but yeah, limbs of trees were cut and large and trees that should not have been cut were cut as well.

2002
02:35:23,952 --> 02:35:30,174
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, and, uh, DPW and DCR were very helpful in removing the large piles of brush that appeared.

2003
02:35:30,194 --> 02:35:34,116
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, I think, um, I think that covers everything you asked about?

2004
02:35:34,136 --> 02:35:36,497
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe so.

2005
02:35:36,537 --> 02:35:36,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.

2006
02:35:38,629 --> 02:35:39,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Director.

2007
02:35:39,610 --> 02:35:40,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion on the council.

2008
02:35:43,011 --> 02:35:44,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for bringing this forward.

2009
02:35:44,552 --> 02:35:49,195
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the motion of Councilor Madam President, Madam President, I'm gonna throw the motion on the questions been asked and answered.

2010
02:35:49,215 --> 02:35:52,977
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it seems like everything that we were going to request they've already done.

2011
02:35:53,997 --> 02:35:54,338
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

2012
02:35:55,098 --> 02:35:55,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2013
02:35:58,335 --> 02:36:16,242
[SPEAKER_05]: 23-048 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council requests the city administration take the necessary steps to require that DCR and DOT perform roadway maintenance repairs on all on-ramps and off-ramps under their respective jurisdictions, and be it further resolved that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to our state delegation.

2014
02:36:16,382 --> 02:36:16,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

2015
02:36:17,635 --> 02:36:32,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam President's rather self explanatory, as you'll know, on ramps and off ramps to 9316 and the like are in some rough shape, and I'm hoping that the dot can come out and give it a little bit of 10 to 11 care to prevent any damage to the resident of cities vehicles.

2016
02:36:34,611 --> 02:36:34,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2017
02:36:34,892 --> 02:36:35,272
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

2018
02:36:35,332 --> 02:36:36,573
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion from the council.

2019
02:36:37,634 --> 02:36:41,398
[SPEAKER_05]: So, on the motion of Council night seconded by Councilor Carlyle Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2020
02:36:49,897 --> 02:36:50,117
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2021
02:36:51,618 --> 02:36:51,858
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2022
02:36:53,659 --> 02:36:55,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2023
02:36:56,601 --> 02:36:56,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2024
02:36:56,862 --> 02:37:08,110
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, seven affirmative zero negative emotion passes to three to 049 offered by Councilor Collins, the result the Metro City Council publicize that increase snap payments known as snap emergency allotments will expire on March 2

2025
02:37:08,857 --> 02:37:10,778
[SPEAKER_05]: and benefits will decrease for all recipients.

2026
02:37:10,978 --> 02:37:14,979
[SPEAKER_05]: More information and resources are available at mass.gov slash extra COVID snap.

2027
02:37:15,459 --> 02:37:24,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Recipients may qualify for new increases to snap benefits based on medical costs or rent expenses and can contact the Department of Transitional Assistance for information about their account.

2028
02:37:24,562 --> 02:37:29,064
[SPEAKER_05]: For the result of the administration share this information via the city's communication channels.

2029
02:37:29,664 --> 02:37:30,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins.

2030
02:37:31,431 --> 02:37:32,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Morell.

2031
02:37:32,611 --> 02:37:38,974
[SPEAKER_04]: So I wanted to use the council as a forum to make sure that as many Medford residents as possible heard about this upcoming change.

2032
02:37:39,954 --> 02:37:43,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Our nation's leaders have allowed for extra pandemic assistance to expire.

2033
02:37:44,135 --> 02:37:50,718
[SPEAKER_04]: So on March 3rd, every household that's currently using SNAP can expect to start receiving at least 95 fewer dollars a month.

2034
02:37:51,918 --> 02:37:56,480
[SPEAKER_04]: This is potentially very damaging to households, especially as cost of living and cost of food remains high.

2035
02:37:57,245 --> 02:38:02,627
[SPEAKER_04]: and local governments have been asked to help get the word out so people can prepare as best they can to fill the gap.

2036
02:38:04,027 --> 02:38:13,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Residents are encouraged to contact the Department of Transitional Assistance for more information about how they will specifically be affected to see if they can qualify for those new increases.

2037
02:38:13,630 --> 02:38:18,332
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did hear from the City's Director of Communications today that the City of Medford is planning to broadcast

2038
02:38:18,832 --> 02:38:22,675
[SPEAKER_04]: this information and those links to resources on the city website and social media channels.

2039
02:38:22,695 --> 02:38:34,545
[SPEAKER_04]: So to residents who are looking for those details about how to investigate this further and look into resources that they and their households can potentially use, I would counsel them to be on the lookout for that.

2040
02:38:34,885 --> 02:38:35,205
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2041
02:38:37,908 --> 02:38:38,608
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

2042
02:38:38,668 --> 02:38:39,789
[SPEAKER_05]: And I did see a Facebook.

2043
02:38:39,829 --> 02:38:41,370
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I know there's many other communication channels.

2044
02:38:41,410 --> 02:38:45,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I did see a Facebook post from the city about this either today or yesterday.

2045
02:38:46,495 --> 02:38:47,836
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion from the council?

2046
02:38:49,022 --> 02:38:50,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Second Councilor Tseng, I do three.

2047
02:38:50,983 --> 02:38:52,484
[SPEAKER_05]: Matthew Page-Lieberman with their hand up.

2048
02:38:55,105 --> 02:39:03,649
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm on SNAP and I am aware of this upcoming, it's a return to the levels from before the pandemic.

2049
02:39:03,669 --> 02:39:07,191
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm really, really happy that Councilor Collins is talking about this.

2050
02:39:07,611 --> 02:39:13,554
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, I have, I'm just a single person and I've rarely got to the grocery store.

2051
02:39:13,574 --> 02:39:14,615
[SPEAKER_12]: So during this pandemic,

2052
02:39:15,233 --> 02:39:17,657
[SPEAKER_12]: I've actually accumulated a lot of snap credit.

2053
02:39:18,418 --> 02:39:29,996
[SPEAKER_12]: And if there's anybody in the audience that could ever, you know, quite a lot of money in my snap account, if there's anybody in the audience who could ever use help with groceries, let me know and I'll buy them.

2054
02:39:30,736 --> 02:39:31,176
[SPEAKER_12]: from this.

2055
02:39:31,336 --> 02:39:32,277
[SPEAKER_12]: It's totally legal.

2056
02:39:32,317 --> 02:39:33,157
[SPEAKER_12]: You can totally do that.

2057
02:39:33,917 --> 02:39:36,098
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to get my information out online.

2058
02:39:36,138 --> 02:39:44,202
[SPEAKER_12]: But if anybody, if you if you're watching at home, if you could contact maybe Councilor Collins, I don't know what your K with you or one of the other counselors just, you know, pastor information.

2059
02:39:44,562 --> 02:39:48,063
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, I could, you know, we could go to the grocery store.

2060
02:39:48,363 --> 02:39:53,125
[SPEAKER_12]: Just let me know, because there are people that are also hungry and I have the resources that I need.

2061
02:39:53,285 --> 02:39:57,607
[SPEAKER_12]: So if anybody needs groceries, please tell somebody and we could see what we can do.

2062
02:39:57,627 --> 02:39:59,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2063
02:39:59,864 --> 02:40:02,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Love to see mutual aid infiltrate the council chambers.

2064
02:40:02,625 --> 02:40:02,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2065
02:40:03,666 --> 02:40:04,346
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

2066
02:40:04,366 --> 02:40:06,707
[SPEAKER_05]: So on the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng.

2067
02:40:07,247 --> 02:40:08,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2068
02:40:13,330 --> 02:40:15,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2069
02:40:15,951 --> 02:40:16,171
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2070
02:40:18,552 --> 02:40:18,853
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2071
02:40:21,454 --> 02:40:22,814
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2072
02:40:23,835 --> 02:40:24,055
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2073
02:40:25,796 --> 02:40:25,996
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2074
02:40:26,156 --> 02:40:28,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

2075
02:40:29,913 --> 02:40:43,263
[SPEAKER_05]: 23-050 offered by Councilor Collins and Vice President Bears, be it resolved that the Medford City Council express its support of HD-2091 and SD-761 and act relative to payments and move taxation by organization exempt from the property tax.

2076
02:40:44,223 --> 02:40:53,090
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it further resolved that the City Clerk forward a copy of this resolution to the Medford Legislative Delegation as well as House Speaker Mariano and Senate President Spilka.

2077
02:40:54,771 --> 02:40:55,312
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins.

2078
02:40:56,192 --> 02:40:57,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Morell.

2079
02:40:57,792 --> 02:41:02,374
[SPEAKER_04]: This council has talked about similar legislation in previous sessions.

2080
02:41:02,694 --> 02:41:15,137
[SPEAKER_04]: The current pilot program statewide still exempts wealthy nonprofits like universities from paying taxes, property taxes, and that short changes cities like ours from much needed, fairly deserved tax revenue.

2081
02:41:16,398 --> 02:41:23,300
[SPEAKER_04]: These are not the shoestring kind of nonprofits that probably the word comes to mind with these.

2082
02:41:24,198 --> 02:41:37,644
[SPEAKER_04]: high wealth nonprofits that are property tax exempt, their revenue is increasing, their endowments are often quite large, and it's not logical for them to be exempt from paying taxes to their host communities, something that every other resident and type of business is required to do.

2083
02:41:39,505 --> 02:41:45,107
[SPEAKER_04]: So this proposed legislation would be to change the existing law to make large nonprofits

2084
02:41:45,717 --> 02:41:49,198
[SPEAKER_04]: no longer able to pay taxes or compensation on a purely voluntary basis.

2085
02:41:49,839 --> 02:41:57,542
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I asked my colleagues for their support for this bill, which would make larger organizations, sorry, large organizations start paying their fair share.

2086
02:41:57,582 --> 02:42:08,526
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we can all imagine the very material ways that recouping some of that lost revenue from large nonprofits like Tufts University and my Alma mater, how big of a difference that would make in our community.

2087
02:42:08,646 --> 02:42:08,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2088
02:42:09,847 --> 02:42:10,627
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

2089
02:42:10,667 --> 02:42:11,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Bears.

2090
02:42:11,647 --> 02:42:12,648
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

2091
02:42:12,668 --> 02:42:14,549
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Councilor Collins for sponsoring this.

2092
02:42:16,156 --> 02:42:22,082
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe, I can't remember which one of us did it last time, but it was me.

2093
02:42:23,283 --> 02:42:25,225
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think you made really great points.

2094
02:42:25,686 --> 02:42:29,790
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that we did two years ago is we were able to look at assessor data at the City of Medford.

2095
02:42:30,590 --> 02:42:33,894
[SPEAKER_06]: And if Tufts, just Tufts for example, was taxed at the same rate as

2096
02:42:35,945 --> 02:42:37,226
[SPEAKER_06]: was taxed at all for property taxes.

2097
02:42:37,246 --> 02:42:39,947
[SPEAKER_06]: They would pay $8 million a year in property taxes.

2098
02:42:41,327 --> 02:42:45,449
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, this law would only require up to 25% of what they would nominally pay, so it would be about $2 million a year.

2099
02:42:50,751 --> 02:42:53,054
[SPEAKER_06]: But I just want to say since we've had the discussions here tonight.

2100
02:42:53,634 --> 02:43:09,853
[SPEAKER_06]: That's $2 million for sidewalk crew to support our firefighters to support all the emergency calls that go out to tops to support street and sidewalk infrastructure repairs in their area to support affordable housing in the area around the top neighborhood, and I'm just putting that out there to say.

2101
02:43:11,437 --> 02:43:22,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I can understand why a nonprofit education or healthcare institution maybe shouldn't be treated the same as a for profit business, but I don't think the answer is that they should be treated, it should be 100% for one and 0% for the other.

2102
02:43:26,420 --> 02:43:28,743
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also want to put out there to this isn't just about tops.

2103
02:43:29,403 --> 02:43:40,395
[SPEAKER_06]: This is about all of the large nonprofit institutions, and whether or not they play pay pilot payments to the city tops for example while this legislation would allow basically up to $2 million.

2104
02:43:41,076 --> 02:43:43,759
[SPEAKER_06]: If they paid normal private tax to be $8 million tops right now pays $450,000 to the city.

2105
02:43:46,321 --> 02:43:54,430
[SPEAKER_06]: But other pilot agreements such as right across the street from this building, Harvard Vanguard used to pay a trace health whatever it is now.

2106
02:43:55,432 --> 02:44:02,399
[SPEAKER_06]: They used to pay a pilot agreement and they pulled out of their power agreement unilaterally without any city engagement they no longer provide any.

2107
02:44:03,342 --> 02:44:04,363
[SPEAKER_06]: pilot payment to the city.

2108
02:44:05,003 --> 02:44:10,828
[SPEAKER_06]: Something I'm exploring actually is that Atrius Health was just bought up and is now a for-profit institution, so maybe they'll have to start paying.

2109
02:44:11,809 --> 02:44:16,033
[SPEAKER_06]: But my point is to say that right now, the way that the current state law reads,

2110
02:44:17,116 --> 02:44:18,958
[SPEAKER_06]: it's up to the discretion of the institution.

2111
02:44:19,919 --> 02:44:26,145
[SPEAKER_06]: And that means that even if you have an agreement, the institution could pull out at any time and leave the city holding the bag.

2112
02:44:26,505 --> 02:44:34,553
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're already holding the bag for all the services and needs in the areas around these large institutions that they're not paying their fair share for.

2113
02:44:35,374 --> 02:44:36,716
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really hope

2114
02:44:38,049 --> 02:44:50,115
[SPEAKER_06]: that the State House can do something to create a fair system where we're still understanding that these are nonprofit health and education institutions that should have some benefit, but that benefit shouldn't be all or nothing the way it is now.

2115
02:44:51,996 --> 02:45:03,402
[SPEAKER_06]: And furthermore, just to drive home the point, this is for large property owners, the threshold, your property has to be worth, I believe, over $15 million to even be qualified under this suggested amendment.

2116
02:45:03,422 --> 02:45:05,803
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you, Councilor Collins, Madam President.

2117
02:45:05,823 --> 02:45:06,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2118
02:45:06,703 --> 02:45:07,864
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion from the Council?

2119
02:45:09,713 --> 02:45:12,296
[SPEAKER_05]: Going back to Councilor Knight.

2120
02:45:13,197 --> 02:45:14,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam President, thank you very much.

2121
02:45:14,378 --> 02:45:21,848
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just important to point out that these large scale nonprofits like healthcare institutions and universities also provide a great community benefit.

2122
02:45:23,132 --> 02:45:24,873
[SPEAKER_02]: namely jobs that provide a living wage.

2123
02:45:26,254 --> 02:45:29,795
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to also take into consideration the economic benefits that they bring to a community.

2124
02:45:30,635 --> 02:45:37,738
[SPEAKER_02]: You see communities that have universities located inside them and the benefits that they have economically when the recession hits.

2125
02:45:37,858 --> 02:45:45,822
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's also important to point out the benefits that come along with having large-scale universities and large-scale healthcare institutions in the community that are non-profit as well.

2126
02:45:48,510 --> 02:45:49,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2127
02:45:49,871 --> 02:45:52,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Going to Matthew Page-Lieberman.

2128
02:45:57,874 --> 02:46:01,755
[SPEAKER_12]: It's very, very good that this, you know, this topic about we're essentially talking about pilot that's coming up.

2129
02:46:03,436 --> 02:46:06,537
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, this has unfortunately been a situation we've been in for quite a few years.

2130
02:46:06,577 --> 02:46:08,878
[SPEAKER_12]: I know there's a local community organization.

2131
02:46:09,058 --> 02:46:12,159
[SPEAKER_12]: They wanted me to assist with a pilot initiative they're working on.

2132
02:46:13,059 --> 02:46:14,060
[SPEAKER_12]: And there was a lot of

2133
02:46:14,744 --> 02:46:21,370
[SPEAKER_12]: things that kind of happened that it seemed like perhaps that group or whatever wasn't really ready to engage with it.

2134
02:46:21,770 --> 02:46:32,820
[SPEAKER_12]: But I did, I remember this, I don't know, like this back during the last mayor's administration, I like kind of looked into stuff and talked to the person who's like the person negotiating at the top level.

2135
02:46:33,761 --> 02:46:35,102
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was following this stuff.

2136
02:46:35,142 --> 02:46:37,904
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe that Mayor Burke was able to

2137
02:46:39,546 --> 02:46:44,289
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of get some kind of agreement because, you know, our contract with, I'm just talking about Tufts, it just ended.

2138
02:46:44,770 --> 02:46:50,834
[SPEAKER_12]: And so my understanding is like, yeah, this was like five years ago or something like this.

2139
02:46:51,915 --> 02:46:54,898
[SPEAKER_12]: And so Tufts had decided to just end

2140
02:46:55,578 --> 02:47:00,741
[SPEAKER_12]: I increased the amount of money that they're giving to each community where they have property.

2141
02:47:01,461 --> 02:47:09,466
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing that any particular community was able to negotiate, no matter how much property they own, no matter how much students or whatever, they just increased that much money.

2142
02:47:09,526 --> 02:47:14,369
[SPEAKER_12]: But there was something that was left off the table, which is the kind of services that particularly Tufts offers.

2143
02:47:14,629 --> 02:47:19,672
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that a lot of times the city likes to have a relationship with interns and stuff like this, what kind of services, like

2144
02:47:19,972 --> 02:47:22,073
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm in class right now at Tufts, right?

2145
02:47:22,113 --> 02:47:23,033
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I'm a Medford student.

2146
02:47:23,053 --> 02:47:23,633
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not paying.

2147
02:47:23,833 --> 02:47:26,154
[SPEAKER_12]: They allow that kind of stuff.

2148
02:47:26,174 --> 02:47:27,374
[SPEAKER_12]: People are in the community.

2149
02:47:28,075 --> 02:47:34,717
[SPEAKER_12]: But this has unfortunately been a conversation that's been going on for a really long time is that we haven't been able to figure out this agreement.

2150
02:47:35,017 --> 02:47:38,638
[SPEAKER_12]: And a lot of folks have just been focusing on, well, perhaps we can get some more money out of them.

2151
02:47:38,938 --> 02:47:42,939
[SPEAKER_12]: But universities provide millions, many, many, many, many resources.

2152
02:47:43,699 --> 02:47:48,641
[SPEAKER_12]: My understanding is from speaking to somebody recently is that one of the reasons that our mayor

2153
02:47:49,501 --> 02:47:58,049
[SPEAKER_12]: even though she did have an editorial in Medford Transcript about three years ago when she was running for office.

2154
02:47:58,089 --> 02:48:00,832
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a list of all these services that TEPs can provide.

2155
02:48:01,272 --> 02:48:05,556
[SPEAKER_12]: But once the pandemic started hitting, everything had to be moved back.

2156
02:48:05,956 --> 02:48:08,839
[SPEAKER_12]: This is about, I guess, three years ago, there was going to be a particular meeting.

2157
02:48:10,060 --> 02:48:15,443
[SPEAKER_12]: for us in City Hall to start having the Tufts discussion, the POD discussion, but it didn't happen.

2158
02:48:16,343 --> 02:48:20,965
[SPEAKER_12]: And so, you know, recently I've reached out to the mayor again, let's start having that conversation.

2159
02:48:22,066 --> 02:48:25,167
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, I mean, like Councilor Knight was talking about the services.

2160
02:48:25,808 --> 02:48:36,533
[SPEAKER_12]: One of my understandings is because of the services that Tufts has been providing during this pandemic, we have been kind of, at City Hall, we've been kind of holding off a little bit and pressuring them to this agreement.

2161
02:48:37,833 --> 02:48:54,683
[SPEAKER_12]: I do completely support any kind of motion to make sure that these universities, these, you know, universities not paying property taxes that have massive amounts of endowments of money that they're sitting on, even when they are paying living wages, they're still sitting on a lot of money.

2162
02:48:55,123 --> 02:48:56,543
[SPEAKER_12]: They own buildings, right?

2163
02:48:56,643 --> 02:49:00,925
[SPEAKER_12]: Many of these buildings are not providing housing for the people outside of the university community.

2164
02:49:01,225 --> 02:49:13,088
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a lot of stuff we can kind of consider here and can we kind of negotiate, you know, these financial resources that we do need, especially when we have counselors that are worried that we're going to go like in the red.

2165
02:49:13,715 --> 02:49:17,016
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, they have the, but beyond that, I'm gonna cut it short.

2166
02:49:17,276 --> 02:49:30,461
[SPEAKER_12]: There are massive amount of services that the universities can be providing as well that a lot of times we do not consider as far as the intellectual services they can provide for creating really new projects, new projects in this community.

2167
02:49:30,621 --> 02:49:32,702
[SPEAKER_12]: And I will not go into it, but really new, new projects.

2168
02:49:33,002 --> 02:49:36,743
[SPEAKER_12]: And I would invite anybody for us all to have the kind of conversation.

2169
02:49:36,963 --> 02:49:39,344
[SPEAKER_12]: And we should be having conversations with Tufts.

2170
02:49:39,924 --> 02:49:47,250
[SPEAKER_12]: about those kinds of new projects and collaboration that we can be involved in, rather than saying, will you do this for us and will you do that for us?

2171
02:49:47,470 --> 02:49:47,810
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

2172
02:49:47,830 --> 02:49:50,212
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2173
02:49:51,933 --> 02:49:52,634
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll be very brief.

2174
02:49:53,414 --> 02:49:58,779
[SPEAKER_16]: William Navarre, 108 Bedford Street, apartment 1B, is basically very similar to what I said last time this came up.

2175
02:49:58,899 --> 02:50:03,082
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the big concerns about Tufts, they're buying up a lot of land specifically.

2176
02:50:03,102 --> 02:50:04,763
[SPEAKER_16]: They're potentially crowding out others.

2177
02:50:05,804 --> 02:50:08,866
[SPEAKER_16]: Taxing the land they own as heavily as possible would help discourage that.

2178
02:50:09,867 --> 02:50:14,691
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously, to balance that out, we'd want to tax their improvements as lightly as possible.

2179
02:50:14,731 --> 02:50:17,113
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't want to discourage them investing in the community.

2180
02:50:17,933 --> 02:50:20,815
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope that that's a structure that we could consider at some point.

2181
02:50:20,936 --> 02:50:25,599
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope council, when it finds the opportunity, can support a scheme like that.

2182
02:50:25,759 --> 02:50:26,059
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2183
02:50:27,020 --> 02:50:27,981
[SPEAKER_03]: Point of information, Madam President.

2184
02:50:29,162 --> 02:50:29,582
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

2185
02:50:30,303 --> 02:50:38,429
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe the city and Tufts University have an agreement where all new purchases of parcels outside the campus, the existing campus, would be put on the tax rolls.

2186
02:50:40,767 --> 02:50:41,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that.

2187
02:50:42,789 --> 02:50:51,256
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Vice President Bears, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2188
02:50:53,038 --> 02:50:53,238
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2189
02:50:55,159 --> 02:51:00,324
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

2190
02:51:01,945 --> 02:51:03,506
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2191
02:51:03,827 --> 02:51:04,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2192
02:51:04,287 --> 02:51:06,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Six in the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes.

2193
02:51:08,299 --> 02:51:10,160
[SPEAKER_05]: 23-051 offered by Councilor Collins and President Morell.

2194
02:51:10,380 --> 02:51:20,583
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved that the City Council request an update from the administration on the status of Medford's allocation from the Commonwealth's opioid litigation settlement proceeds in light of the five additional proposed national settlements.

2195
02:51:21,184 --> 02:51:33,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it further resolved that the administration confirm whether the required state subdivision agreement has been submitted to the Attorney General to render Medford eligible to receive an increased allocation from the municipal settlement proceeds.

2196
02:51:33,728 --> 02:51:34,348
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins.

2197
02:51:36,547 --> 02:51:39,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Morell, and thank you for co-sponsoring this.

2198
02:51:39,708 --> 02:51:45,111
[SPEAKER_04]: This is pertaining to the National Opioid Settlements against the manufacturers and distributors of opioid painkillers.

2199
02:51:46,251 --> 02:52:01,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Late last year, it was announced that five additional settlements were reached with more opioid distributors, and states and cities are being allocated funds to go towards prevention and community-wide rehabilitation as resulting from the national opioid epidemic.

2200
02:52:02,305 --> 02:52:08,110
[SPEAKER_04]: The council did actually receive an update from Director of Communications earlier today with some good news.

2201
02:52:08,170 --> 02:52:25,608
[SPEAKER_04]: We are confirmed to receive a distribution as a result of this settlement and our Board of Health and Office of Prevention Department staff has already been anticipating the five additional settlements, which is to say the city is on top of it.

2202
02:52:26,611 --> 02:52:27,812
[SPEAKER_04]: which is great to hear.

2203
02:52:27,852 --> 02:52:28,793
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm grateful to hear that.

2204
02:52:30,034 --> 02:52:46,147
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to share with the community, the update that we received, which I think was also disseminated early December, these funds can be used for sort of pertinent uses such as opioid use disorder treatment, support for people in recovery, harm reduction, prevention of opioid misuse.

2205
02:52:46,387 --> 02:52:51,912
[SPEAKER_04]: And the city has a number of next steps that they'll be conducting community outreach about.

2206
02:52:52,612 --> 02:53:01,139
[SPEAKER_04]: including establishing a promote prevent support behavioral health commission, um, feedback and listening sessions with the community.

2207
02:53:02,060 --> 02:53:10,227
[SPEAKER_04]: And the city council will be hearing more about, um, the specific plan and role of that commission as it gets formed over the next year.

2208
02:53:11,068 --> 02:53:11,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

2209
02:53:12,009 --> 02:53:12,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2210
02:53:12,189 --> 02:53:13,970
[SPEAKER_05]: And just I appreciate you sharing that update.

2211
02:53:13,990 --> 02:53:20,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And just to add to that, the information, um, that you just referenced, the update can be found on the health department's website on the city website.

2212
02:53:21,348 --> 02:53:25,312
[SPEAKER_05]: under opioid settlement information and there's a drop down right there with some links as well.

2213
02:53:25,913 --> 02:53:27,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Knight.

2214
02:53:27,334 --> 02:53:28,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Madam President, thank you very much.

2215
02:53:29,870 --> 02:53:33,132
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd be remiss if we didn't recognize our colleague, Councilor Caraviello.

2216
02:53:33,713 --> 02:53:39,597
[SPEAKER_02]: It was Councilor Caraviello's resolution under the Burke administration that got us involved in the opioid lawsuit.

2217
02:53:40,397 --> 02:53:44,640
[SPEAKER_02]: And without his foresight and vision, we wouldn't be here today receiving these funds.

2218
02:53:45,141 --> 02:53:56,629
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to thank him for taking the opportunity to be invested in the war on recovery here in our city and the steps that he took to make sure that we received these funds.

2219
02:53:58,663 --> 02:53:59,343
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2220
02:53:59,383 --> 02:54:00,364
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

2221
02:54:01,205 --> 02:54:01,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice-Mayor Bears.

2222
02:54:02,205 --> 02:54:03,066
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

2223
02:54:03,306 --> 02:54:06,108
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you to my fellow councilors, Councilor Caraviello.

2224
02:54:06,748 --> 02:54:19,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just wanted to also shout out Director of Prevention and Outreach, Penny Funiol, and also Alicia Lundgren, our social worker, who I believe has a presentation around this that's on the city website that President Burrell referenced, so thank you.

2225
02:54:19,877 --> 02:54:20,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice-Mayor Bears.

2226
02:54:21,598 --> 02:54:24,460
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by... Second.

2227
02:54:24,940 --> 02:54:26,461
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2228
02:54:35,384 --> 02:54:35,604
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2229
02:54:37,705 --> 02:54:38,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2230
02:54:40,745 --> 02:54:41,185
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2231
02:54:41,205 --> 02:54:41,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2232
02:54:42,746 --> 02:54:59,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, seven the inferno zero in the negative passes to 3.05 to offer by Vice President bears be resolved by the city council that appendix A of the city of Medford code of ordinances be amended to include the following section 9.2 plan development districts.

2233
02:55:01,886 --> 02:55:22,516
[SPEAKER_05]: blank plan development district per square foot area above 5,000 square feet of construction regardless of use amount of 5 cents and section these revised ordinances is 94 dash 9.2 and this is the plan development district fee that has been discussed in at least two committee meetings reported out.

2234
02:55:23,516 --> 02:55:24,136
[SPEAKER_05]: This is embarrassing.

2235
02:55:24,837 --> 02:55:25,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's it.

2236
02:55:25,477 --> 02:55:27,538
[SPEAKER_06]: This is just us putting the fee of

2237
02:55:28,717 --> 02:55:35,545
[SPEAKER_06]: five cents per five for each square foot, about 5,000 square feet as a fee for plan development district applications into the code of ordinance.

2238
02:55:35,585 --> 02:55:37,226
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would move to approve for first reading.

2239
02:55:39,169 --> 02:55:45,636
[SPEAKER_05]: On the emotion of our bears to first reading seconded by Councilor Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2240
02:56:00,580 --> 02:56:00,880
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2241
02:56:04,482 --> 02:56:04,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2242
02:56:06,423 --> 02:56:23,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, 70 in front of zero in the negative the motion passes for first reading to three s 053 offer by Councilor Tseng the result of the city administration provider for updating the city council on its progress on the social justice roadmap via for the result of the city administration update the roadmap were labeled and deemed appropriate Councilor Tseng.

2243
02:56:24,812 --> 02:56:25,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, President Morell.

2244
02:56:26,694 --> 02:56:29,196
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess there's a small typo in here.

2245
02:56:29,216 --> 02:56:32,358
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just amend it to strike labeled and.

2246
02:56:34,639 --> 02:56:48,191
[SPEAKER_07]: This is one of three resolutions I have on the agenda tonight that are in the spirit of Black History Month and having gone to a few of the city's events, you know, a recurring theme is what can we do to advance social justice and racial justice in Medford?

2247
02:56:48,211 --> 02:56:57,419
[SPEAKER_07]: And what can we do as a city government to meet the high standards that we're setting for ourselves and to listen to our residents?

2248
02:56:58,500 --> 02:56:58,640
[SPEAKER_07]: And

2249
02:56:59,696 --> 02:57:14,901
[SPEAKER_07]: A few years ago, our city published a social justice roadmap, which detailed a bunch of steps that our administration and our city would take to even out the scales and to pursue a policy of equity in the city.

2250
02:57:16,381 --> 02:57:27,405
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think it's been about three years since the last update, and I've worked with the diversity director to kind of put this on an agenda and to kind of just

2251
02:57:29,991 --> 02:57:39,435
[SPEAKER_07]: talk to the administration a little bit and ask for an update and to ask for updated steps about what action steps we still need to do to reach those lofty goals.

2252
02:57:40,396 --> 02:57:41,136
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

2253
02:57:41,236 --> 02:57:42,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion from the Council?

2254
02:57:42,677 --> 02:57:43,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice-President Bears.

2255
02:57:43,617 --> 02:57:44,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam President.

2256
02:57:44,337 --> 02:57:45,858
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just add to Councilor Tseng's point.

2257
02:57:45,918 --> 02:57:48,339
[SPEAKER_06]: I think he already made it, but I'm just kind of reiterating it.

2258
02:57:48,879 --> 02:57:53,782
[SPEAKER_06]: When we have plans and we have hopes and approaches,

2259
02:57:54,926 --> 02:57:59,748
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the place where the city falls down after that is milestones and goals and checking in.

2260
02:58:00,088 --> 02:58:04,629
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this is a request for that on the social justice roadmap that's much needed.

2261
02:58:04,709 --> 02:58:07,450
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you, Councilor Tseng.

2262
02:58:07,810 --> 02:58:08,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Vice Mayor.

2263
02:58:08,570 --> 02:58:13,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Tseng, going back to your amendment, is this just saying like, in that last sentence, we're labeled just getting rid of the one hand?

2264
02:58:13,912 --> 02:58:14,632
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, just get rid of it.

2265
02:58:14,692 --> 02:58:16,933
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the clerk's opinion that it doesn't need to be amended.

2266
02:58:16,953 --> 02:58:19,674
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a- Oh, perfect.

2267
02:58:19,914 --> 02:58:20,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Scrivener's error.

2268
02:58:22,812 --> 02:58:29,573
[SPEAKER_05]: So, on the motion of cancer saying second by cancer Scarpelli Mr. Please call the role.

2269
02:58:32,934 --> 02:58:33,234
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2270
02:58:34,274 --> 02:58:36,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2271
02:58:36,795 --> 02:58:38,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2272
02:58:39,095 --> 02:58:39,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

2273
02:58:41,756 --> 02:58:41,996
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2274
02:58:42,596 --> 02:58:42,856
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2275
02:58:43,296 --> 02:58:44,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2276
02:58:44,636 --> 02:58:49,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, seven the affirmative zero negative emotion passes to three dash 054 offered by cancer saying

2277
02:58:49,790 --> 02:58:54,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Be it resolved the city council asked the city administration to conduct an updated racial equity study.

2278
02:58:55,176 --> 02:58:55,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2279
02:58:55,837 --> 02:58:57,679
[SPEAKER_07]: This one is slightly different.

2280
02:58:57,759 --> 02:59:05,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Having talked with the diversity director feels that this is something that is standard and different municipalities that we don't miss, we haven't necessarily done here.

2281
02:59:06,808 --> 02:59:19,792
[SPEAKER_07]: It will require not a dramatic increase increase of resources but a little bit of help up her end, which is why I'm passing this resolution from the city council side showing that there's support for me here is important.

2282
02:59:20,533 --> 02:59:26,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, it's not something that would really take that much more money it's just, it's just something that.

2283
02:59:27,395 --> 02:59:33,176
[SPEAKER_07]: we again need to poke the administration a little bit and to get them to try to do.

2284
02:59:33,736 --> 02:59:40,097
[SPEAKER_07]: The main difference between a racial equity study and a social justice roadmap is social justice roadmap is much broader.

2285
02:59:40,117 --> 02:59:47,379
[SPEAKER_07]: It lays, as many have read the document, lays out general steps and policies that we need to consider.

2286
02:59:47,639 --> 02:59:53,340
[SPEAKER_07]: The racial equity study is looking more at this very specific topic and looking at what

2287
02:59:54,560 --> 03:00:06,209
[SPEAKER_07]: what data we need to collect, what actions we need to take within City Hall to make a better environment for our staff, very specific, very concrete, much narrower actions.

2288
03:00:07,350 --> 03:00:08,130
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

2289
03:00:08,631 --> 03:00:09,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Any further discussion?

2290
03:00:10,772 --> 03:00:13,734
[SPEAKER_05]: On the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Vice President Paris.

2291
03:00:13,754 --> 03:00:14,835
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2292
03:00:18,338 --> 03:00:18,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2293
03:00:28,319 --> 03:00:28,479
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

2294
03:00:29,721 --> 03:00:41,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, seven the in front of us here that I get the motion passes to three dash 055 offered by cancer saying it resolved the subcommittee on racial justice disabilities and elder affairs consider a welcoming city ordinance cancer site.

2295
03:00:42,056 --> 03:00:42,456
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2296
03:00:42,636 --> 03:00:58,164
[SPEAKER_07]: This one sounds a bit more ambitious than it actually is really what this is is codifying are the legal language we already have right now city policy regarding interactions with immigrants and our non cooperation policy with ice.

2297
03:00:58,844 --> 03:01:03,986
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something that the police department already backs already has legal language from our past solicitors on.

2298
03:01:05,874 --> 03:01:24,335
[SPEAKER_07]: This, this is really more about starting the process because a lot of, in particular, Latino and Haitian residents have reached out to me, and to see staff here, afraid to really engage with city services because they don't know if how they're

2299
03:01:25,436 --> 03:01:28,321
[SPEAKER_07]: know the repercussions of engaging with the city government.

2300
03:01:29,582 --> 03:01:35,491
[SPEAKER_07]: We know that it's safe for them, but this is something that could be used to

2301
03:01:37,389 --> 03:01:44,492
[SPEAKER_07]: to get the word out that it is safe for them, to guarantee them their rights and safety in our community.

2302
03:01:45,053 --> 03:01:52,256
[SPEAKER_07]: And some residents have come up to me with the worry that because it is policy, it could change at any point in the future.

2303
03:01:53,396 --> 03:02:05,322
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas if we codify it right now, even just the language that we have written and approved, that would mean a lot to them and mean a lot for them to feel safe about engaging city services.

2304
03:02:05,922 --> 03:02:08,646
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, this is not something that's meant to be very ambitious.

2305
03:02:08,706 --> 03:02:14,593
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something that's meant to take the legal language we have right now that we're enforcing right now, put it into our code.

2306
03:02:15,254 --> 03:02:15,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

2307
03:02:16,856 --> 03:02:17,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Collins.

2308
03:02:18,418 --> 03:02:20,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I thank Councilor Tseng for putting this forward.

2309
03:02:20,981 --> 03:02:24,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a clear example where, you know,

2310
03:02:25,011 --> 03:02:27,452
[SPEAKER_04]: words matter and formalizing the right policy matters.

2311
03:02:27,552 --> 03:02:53,877
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's, you know, a really, it puts our community in a very positive, strong light that this is a policy that our city staff are already carrying out and what we can do as a legislative body to make sure that we are using our power as a forum and a speaker box for the community to make sure that it's known to as many communities as possible, sorry, as many constituents as possible, that interfacing with any city department

2312
03:02:54,847 --> 03:03:01,748
[SPEAKER_04]: regardless of your immigration status, is a good thing to do, a safe thing to do, and that they can trust the outcomes of that interaction.

2313
03:03:01,788 --> 03:03:06,349
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that codifying this formally will help us just promulgate that to more of the community.

2314
03:03:07,110 --> 03:03:09,130
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm happy to support this tonight.

2315
03:03:09,170 --> 03:03:09,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2316
03:03:10,050 --> 03:03:10,870

03:04:10,523 --> 03:04:18,387

[SPEAKER_14]: It's now March and it's the 10th anniversary of that tragedy.

2334
03:04:24,406 --> 03:04:32,694
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't seen the paper back on what I did receive something from, because we do have money in a trust.

2335
03:04:33,454 --> 03:04:34,015
[SPEAKER_14]: They fixed that.

2336
03:04:37,850 --> 03:04:42,852
[SPEAKER_14]: They were waiting for a piece spent George but three years with that piece very important piece of three years.

2337
03:04:43,872 --> 03:04:48,074
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been waiting for that piece.

2338
03:04:48,514 --> 03:04:49,494
[SPEAKER_14]: The fire truck.

2339
03:04:49,894 --> 03:04:53,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I don't know what piece you're waiting for me to say you've been waiting for that piece of three years.

2340
03:04:53,735 --> 03:04:57,877
[SPEAKER_14]: You know the celebration is in a few in a few weeks.

2341

2343
03:05:05,822 --> 03:05:11,646
[SPEAKER_14]: Be ashamed if that fountain isn't up and going, especially where we have the money in the trust fund, they'll pay for that.

[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, I can follow up on that.
