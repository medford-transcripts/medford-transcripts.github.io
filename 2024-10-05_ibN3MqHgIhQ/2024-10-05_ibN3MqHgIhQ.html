    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=786.065s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=787.005s">I</a>  know that I appreciate Chief being here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=790.726s">I</a>  know that we just had a few concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=793.647s">One</a>  that I know that as we're looking at our budget coming forward and understanding that we might have some issues with the fleet and seeing what we need to do, we can do as a council to try to help move things along if we need to need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=811.28s">to</a>  make sure that you get all the apparatus you need for the safety of your men and women. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=817.687s">So</a>  that'll be the first thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=821.131s">And</a>  then I know that there were some concerns about benefits for new hirees, that we can shed some light.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=831.161s">Okay,</a>  the benefits for the new hires, that's human resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=835.287s">So</a>  I'll have to have Mr. Osborne address you on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=838.973s">I</a>  do know I have three members, two that were hired in February of 22 and the other one hired in September of 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=847.677s">that</a>  there's some sort of issue with the healthcare and human resources takes care of that end of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=853.379s">So</a>  you'd have to ask Mr. Rogers what's going on there.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=857.38s">Someone's</a>  here tonight, so I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=859.041s">So</a>  if you can shed some light on our fleet, that would be.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=863.242s">Okay,</a>  so the fleet, I'll just give you a brief summary of what's going on with the fleet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=869.584s">Obviously,</a>  we have two new ladder trucks that we've experienced some warranty issues with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=875.452s">I</a>  have negotiated with Seagrave to extend the warranty another year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=879.233s">They</a>  have been really good standing behind me with repairing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=882.354s">The</a>  problem is, you know, the repairs sometimes take time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=885.894s">So</a>  luckily we have two spares, so I've been able to juggle the spares. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=888.995s">And</a>  one of the aerials is in Jersey right now, getting everything finished up on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=895.217s">The</a>  other one's currently in service, and then the other two spares are, one of them's operating, the other one's in the shop also. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=901.957s">Okay,</a>  so as far as the pumps go, when trucks get to a certain age and a certain number of hours and mileage, they're at the end of their usable life. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=912.04s">So</a>  we have two pumps that were purchased in 2000. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=917.282s">So</a>  that's kind of self-explanatory, they're 23 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=921.624s">They</a>  got pushed into the front line because of a premature frame failure on engine six, which is a 2008 PS Sabre. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=931.434s">So</a>  that was something nobody could really foresee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=933.975s">It</a>  just, you know, we had it in for some maintenance and, you know, we examined the frame and we discovered that the frame was, you know, unsafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=941.419s">So</a>  we were forced to put it out of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=943.76s">So</a>  what that did was it brought these spare apparatus to the frontline. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=948.342s">And</a>  then we experienced a couple of, you know, major mechanical failures in those, which I was able to <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=955.879s">absorb</a>  in my budget it took up over half my maintenance budget but I was able to repair those and they're back from repairs and those are going to be run in the foreseeable future till we can get something new. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=968.83s">As</a>  far as like what we're going to purchase when we're going to purchase it the mayor and I are working on that on a purchase plan to figure out what we can buy and how many and that's something that's like a in progress that I really can't tell you you know we're not there yet but we're working diligently to <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=985.543s">figure</a>  out how we can get out of this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=988.566s">The</a>  other issue that's come into play is, and it's part of the sort of a result of the pandemic and the supply chain interruption is these trucks to build them now, it's up to 820 days from the time you complete the order to the time the truck arrives. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1004.379s">So</a>  that's a little over two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1006.761s">And</a>  then if you add in the time it takes to <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1010.85s">put</a>  radios in them, tablets, letter them, train the personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1015.151s">You're</a>  talking two and a half years before you're gonna see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1020.132s">And</a>  that keeps going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1021.872s">Every</a>  time we wait, if we don't get it done, another month goes by, it's another month, and then we end up having to wait longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1030.514s">So</a>  that's why we were forced to kind of repair these older trucks to kind of keep the fleet operational. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1036.916s">And</a>  that's where we're at with the fleet.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1039.872s">If</a>  you have any questions, I'll yeah, so I know that one of some of the residents are asking that why is there a Boston truck and I don't know if we said maybe there was a fire and they were covering and then someone said what happened with the Boston truck was.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1054.636s">When</a>  we experienced the two major component failures on the other two trucks, I was forced to borrow a truck from Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1061.799s">And</a>  they were gracious enough to give it to us for a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1065.16s">And</a>  they do that for other departments in the metro fire area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1069.582s">I</a>  have a good relationship with the chief and the mechanics in Boston, and they support us if I call them for something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1076.704s">As</a>  long as they have something available, they'll lend it with the idea that they may need it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1082.529s">If</a>  I get that phone call, I have to give it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1084.411s">So</a>  it saved us from browning anything out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1086.672s">We</a>  basically were running that Boston truck for a period of time.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1090.916s">So</a>  this, I'll say it, Chief, this seems dire. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1097.401s">This</a>  should have been something that this administration should have asked for two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1103.055s">And</a>  this is something that is, do we have a representative from the administration?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1109.642s">We</a>  have Neil Osborne, but I'm not seeing anyone.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1112.345s">Okay,</a>  so that's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1114.026s">So</a>  I look at that because usually when you present a capital plan like this, it's in the capital projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1122.992s">We</a>  haven't seen, have we got an update? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1126.214s">So</a>  I know that, you know, I know that the mayor put out that the station, Main Street stations now going under this, that, and the other thing, and that's great, but these are the things that frighten me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1137.399s">This</a>  is great if we have a brand new fire station, but, you know, are we gonna be, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1143.339s">you</a>  know, rent in a U-Haul truck and throwing some ladders on the top, because we don't have fire engines. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1148.161s">So</a>  that's what I fear right now, because as you're saying, two and a half years away, and we're in discussions about ordering them, I think this council needs to play a bigger role in this, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1161.507s">I</a>  think that we need to make a motion that we need to have an emergency meeting, as committee of the whole, with procurement office, with the mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1171.611s">And</a>  really, let's try to figure out a way to get this audit sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1177.444s">I</a>  mean, I don't, I know it's not <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1182.022s">It's</a>  not a popular thing, it's tough to be up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1183.783s">I</a>  know it is, but from here, I know how dangerous your jobs are, and not to have the proper equipment that you need, whether it's turnout gear, whether it's fire trucks.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1195.311s">I</a>  literally, just so I can stop you for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1198.633s">Maybe</a>  I wasn't clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1199.514s">Okay,</a>  so when we, the mayor and I discussed this, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1204.637s">It</a>  takes a period of time for manufacturers to quote that price, you know, the price of the apparatus and that lead time that I was just telling you about that constantly changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1214.986s">And</a>  now they're only guaranteeing that for 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1217.548s">So</a>  every time, if we go beyond the 30 days, it has to be recorded and then that takes time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1222.552s">So</a>  I recently, like two days ago, handed the mayor all the updated information on the price quote, the lead time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1230.738s">And</a>  we are in discussions, like I said, on figuring out how we're going to fund that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1237.062s">And</a>  that comes from her staff and her, not me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1241.224s">I</a>  just give her the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1244.226s">you</a>  know, she has to make that commitment where that's gonna be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1247.749s">And</a>  then once I get that, I can actually order the truck and get that clock ticking.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1251.772s">Chief,</a>  I appreciate everything you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1253.333s">I</a>  know this is nothing on you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1255.055s">What</a>  I'm saying, sitting here, we've ordered fire trucks in the past with Chief Gilberti and this administration, the administration prior to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1262.741s">So</a>  originally this council was involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1265.763s">That's</a>  what I'm trying to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1267.004s">If</a>  we're waiting for the 30 days and you're sitting with the mayor and she's putting something together with other different departments, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1273.129s">Guess</a>  who they have to come to to ask for the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1275.232s">They</a>  have to come here and we know nothing about it.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1278.296s">I'm</a>  sure there's other department heads that are all asking for their stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1281.099s">So</a>  she's looking at an entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1282.722s">I'm</a>  just looking at one.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1284.444s">As</a>  a city councilor, what I'm saying, this is what I'm telling you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1287.287s">You</a>  don't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1288.249s">I'm</a>  telling you what I see. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1290.151s">is</a>  that I don't care what other departments don't have paperclips. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1294.054s">Our</a>  firemen, firewomen don't have the equipment they need to succeed and be safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1298.898s">So</a>  I know it's not it's not popular for you to say it, but I can say it chief and it's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1303.242s">But</a>  I will tell you we need to have an emergency meeting with the mayor to see where this council falls in to make sure we're in the loop to make sure that we can hold meetings <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1313.07s">to</a>  clear any funding that we have to approve to make sure this happens within 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1318.878s">That's</a>  all I'm trying to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1320.4s">And</a>  I'm only saying this because I'm in your corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1323.764s">I</a>  want to support your people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1328.009s">This</a>  is something that <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1329.591s">working</a>  here for 16 years, whether on the school committee, city council, we've been directly involved when we talked about the previous fire trucks or different, different, uh, you know, uh, expenditures that we put out, whether it was for police cars or a new station or whatnot, but we were involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1347.681s">This</a>  council has yet to see updated financials. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1350.802s">So</a>  we're, we're, we're nervous chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1353.203s">I'm</a>  nervous that we're going to get to me and we're going to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1356.005s">I'm</a>  going to say, forget the fire trucks, George. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1358.944s">We</a>  might have to cut firemen or firewomen, and I don't want that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1362.285s">This</a>  is what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1363.125s">We</a>  need to get together with the chief, with the mayor's office, and really start, because they've gone publicly to different arenas, and they publicly mentioned how awful the budget's gonna be this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1375.709s">And</a>  listen, I'm publicly saying this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1377.749s">I've</a>  said it a thousand times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1379.05s">I'm</a>  sounding redundant to everybody, and I sound like a crybaby at times, but I'm frightened. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1384.711s">I'm</a>  nervous, because I don't know what we're doing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1387.54s">This</a>  council hasn't talked to anybody about what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1390.782s">So</a>  thank you for coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1392.664s">Thank</a>  you for the update. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1393.744s">My</a>  recommendation is that we make motion that we call for an emergency meeting with the mayor's office to get an update on the capital plan dealing specifically with ordering the fire trucks within this 30-day window so the clock can start now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1407.914s">Does</a>  2020 code that, Chief? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1410.256s">2020</a>  trucks? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1413.098s">And</a>  the possibility is we have to make them last for at least another two and a half years if the clock started today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1418.139s">So</a>  that's why we need to get the clock started. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1420.119s">We</a>  need to do whatever we need to do as a council to jump ahead of anything needed that this council needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1426.52s">So</a>  whatever we can do, that's all I'm asking, Chief, is to get the administration to sit down with us and say, whatever we need, let's get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1434.562s">Let's</a>  understand if we can use our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1436.222s">Let's</a>  see if we can, you know, what other funding mechanisms we can use. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1441.303s">to</a>  make sure this happens right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1442.785s">That's</a>  that's all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1443.685s">I</a>  mean, I'll give you an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1446.128s">Sounds</a>  pretty dire. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1447.409s">We're</a>  down a few a few trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1449.811s">We</a>  have a we have a motion later on resolution today for another $1.5 million in sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1455.116s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1456.618s">I</a>  don't we haven't even know we don't know where the last 1.5 went last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1460.161s">So</a>  before I these are the issues that we don't know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1463.503s">That's</a>  why I asked you to come up and I know it's I know and I don't make I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable in any way chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1468.507s">Yeah,</a>  you're doing an amazing job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1470.809s">Yeah,</a>  you have one of the best departments in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1474.912s">I</a>  know and I speak firsthand for the way they treated my mom and my dad when they when they were leaving the service. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1480.176s">So</a>  I can't say enough about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1482.618s">So</a>  but <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1485.694s">We</a>  know, we can see the issues, but we haven't heard anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1488.537s">That's</a>  why having you come up and just shed some light, I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1491.301s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1492.082s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1498.569s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1499.41s">Chief.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1504.437s">I</a>  know in the past, I think our last one, didn't we do a lease to own on our last two fire trucks?</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1510.781s">We</a>  did lease purchase on both ladders. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1512.482s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1513.083s">And</a>  tied them with the casino money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1515.464s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1516.365s">So</a>  they did a 10-year lease on each truck, and that money each year pays for the lease purchase. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1521.689s">It's</a>  a 10-year lease purchase.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1523.25s">So</a>  I'm assuming we're going to look to do the same thing going forward?</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1527.172s">That's</a>  a question you have to ask the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1529.494s">It</a>  all depends on how they want to fund it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1531.495s">There's</a>  many different ways they could choose to fund it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1535.177s">And</a>  I know between you and the former chief how long it takes to get these trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1541.219s">Say</a>  that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1542.139s">I</a>  said I know between yourself and the former chief how long it takes to get a fire truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1546.5s">I</a>  know it takes almost.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1548.32s">So</a>  that's what I was trying to explain earlier was that that time frame keeps changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1554.282s">So</a>  at the end of 30 days, say a bunch of departments order 50 trucks, that could turn into 900. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1560.463s">It</a>  could just keep going up because you get behind in the line.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1565.137s">And</a>  I thank Councilor Scott for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1566.938s">And</a>  what does she mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1567.539s">Because</a>  the three workhorses in the community are the police, fire, and DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1573.504s">And</a>  what about those three departments?</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1576.406s">So</a>  like for example, the ladder trucks, they took 400 days back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1581.01s">But</a>  since the pandemic and the supply chain interruption and material shortages, all the departments are in the same kind of problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1588.716s">They're</a>  trying to get trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1590.337s">And</a>  what happens is that lead time just keeps going up and up and up as more and more departments order. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1596.882s">And</a>  like I said, that supply chain interruption, we're still seeing the effects of that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1604.246s">market?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1604.986s">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1605.827s">Right</a>  now, we looked around, there's nothing around. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1607.948s">I</a>  mean, I don't know.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1609.129s">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1609.629s">Obviously,</a>  obviously entertain that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1611.971s">Yeah,</a>  like, we borrow from Boston, I even tried to buy one of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1617.674s">Just</a>  too precious. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1618.454s">They're</a>  not letting go of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1619.795s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1620.195s">So</a>  and then there's nothing around. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1621.396s">We</a>  just we looked around. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1622.497s">There</a>  really isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1623.838s">Everyone's</a>  in the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1624.958s">It's</a>  not just Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1626.039s">It's</a>  not a whole metro fire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1629.901s">You</a>  know, we try to see if we could, you know, like, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1633.905s">work</a>  on a purchase for some of those used trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1637.267s">And</a>  even though they're not ideal, when we have a component failure on the two older 23-year-old trucks, that's not something ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1645.472s">I</a>  didn't want to fix those, but I had to because I couldn't find anything better used. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1650.255s">We</a>  knew exactly what those were. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1652.648s">And</a>  it was, it was a lot of money, but you know, I had enough in the budget that I could absorb it, but it took up over half my maintenance budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1658.993s">So</a>  what's going to happen in the summer when we got a maintenance stuff, we're going to get, it's going to be very tight this year because of those failures. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1666.7s">So,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1669.09s">You</a>  know, that's, and the other issue that happens is if you don't have spares, you can't maintenance the fleet.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1674.071s">That's</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1674.571s">So</a>  it's not like I'm, you know, adding an extra truck so I can have extra trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1678.152s">It's,</a>  you know, if engine one needs maintenance, you gotta have something to back it up.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1681.373s">Yeah,</a>  no, and I understand, you know, when they go off for repairs, they're out there for a couple of months.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1686.395s">So</a>  the other issue that's happening is we're running, our run totals went way up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1690.896s">So</a>  we went from, say, under 10,000 to over 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1694.477s">We're</a>  almost 13,000 runs a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1696.898s">So</a>  now engine one, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1699.266s">73,000</a>  miles on it already. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1701.47s">So,</a>  you know, it's a 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1704.156s">So</a>  think about that, you know, those trucks are in two and a half years, they're going to have almost 100,000 miles on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1711.212s">So</a>  that's the other issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1712.652s">We're</a>  trying to get them ordered so we can rotate the fleet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1715.093s">Like</a>  in the past, we'd get them in before they got, like say they get to 40,000, then we rotate them and the new stuff comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1721.574s">But</a>  because of this huge two and a half year delay, engine one and engine four, they're gonna run to the point where they're gonna have almost 100,000 on them when we go to rotate.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1732.876s">And</a>  you know, I would hope that, you know, going forward that, you know, the plan would be to, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1739.992s">As</a>  soon as we buy one and get it delivered, we order another one just to keep rotating.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1747.116s">Some</a>  cities have, like I put some stuff into the CIP. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1750.658s">If</a>  you look at it, it's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1753.52s">You</a>  know, to buy one a year till we get three of them or buy three up front. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1757.402s">There's</a>  different options you can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1759.229s">But</a>  with the delay, if you buy one a year, so we would get the first one in 25, and then the second one would come in 26, and then 27, you'd start to see some relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1769.637s">But</a>  in other cities, what they do is they don't keep trucks this long. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1772.98s">They</a>  have city ordinances where they, every so many years you buy a pump, and every so many years you buy a ladder. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1780.385s">Before</a>  they get to that age where they're having those major component failures that I was talking about.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1786.67s">Maybe</a>  that's an ordinance that we look to put in going forward.</p>
