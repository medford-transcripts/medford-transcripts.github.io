    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=786.065s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=787.005s">I</a>  know that I appreciate Chief being here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=790.726s">I</a>  know that we just had a few concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=793.647s">One</a>  that I know that as we're looking at our budget coming forward and understanding that we might have some issues with the fleet and seeing what we need to do, we can do as a council to try to help move things along if we need to need to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=811.28s">to</a>  make sure that you get all the apparatus you need for the safety of your men and women. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=817.687s">So</a>  that'll be the first thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=821.131s">And</a>  then I know that there were some concerns about benefits for new hirees, that we can shed some light.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=831.161s">Okay,</a>  the benefits for the new hires, that's human resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=835.287s">So</a>  I'll have to have Mr. Osborne address you on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=838.973s">I</a>  do know I have three members, two that were hired in February of 22 and the other one hired in September of 22. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=847.677s">that</a>  there's some sort of issue with the healthcare and human resources takes care of that end of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=853.379s">So</a>  you'd have to ask Mr. Rogers what's going on there.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=857.38s">Someone's</a>  here tonight, so I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=859.041s">So</a>  if you can shed some light on our fleet, that would be.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=863.242s">Okay,</a>  so the fleet, I'll just give you a brief summary of what's going on with the fleet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=869.584s">Obviously,</a>  we have two new ladder trucks that we've experienced some warranty issues with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=875.452s">I</a>  have negotiated with Seagrave to extend the warranty another year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=879.233s">They</a>  have been really good standing behind me with repairing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=882.354s">The</a>  problem is, you know, the repairs sometimes take time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=885.894s">So</a>  luckily we have two spares, so I've been able to juggle the spares. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=888.995s">And</a>  one of the aerials is in Jersey right now, getting everything finished up on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=895.217s">The</a>  other one's currently in service, and then the other two spares are, one of them's operating, the other one's in the shop also. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=901.957s">Okay,</a>  so as far as the pumps go, when trucks get to a certain age and a certain number of hours and mileage, they're at the end of their usable life. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=912.04s">So</a>  we have two pumps that were purchased in 2000. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=917.282s">So</a>  that's kind of self-explanatory, they're 23 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=921.624s">They</a>  got pushed into the front line because of a premature frame failure on engine six, which is a 2008 PS Sabre. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=931.434s">So</a>  that was something nobody could really foresee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=933.975s">It</a>  just, you know, we had it in for some maintenance and, you know, we examined the frame and we discovered that the frame was, you know, unsafe. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=941.419s">So</a>  we were forced to put it out of service. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=943.76s">So</a>  what that did was it brought these spare apparatus to the frontline. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=948.342s">And</a>  then we experienced a couple of, you know, major mechanical failures in those, which I was able to <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=955.879s">absorb</a>  in my budget it took up over half my maintenance budget but I was able to repair those and they're back from repairs and those are going to be run in the foreseeable future till we can get something new. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=968.83s">As</a>  far as like what we're going to purchase when we're going to purchase it the mayor and I are working on that on a purchase plan to figure out what we can buy and how many and that's something that's like a in progress that I really can't tell you you know we're not there yet but we're working diligently to <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=985.543s">figure</a>  out how we can get out of this problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=988.566s">The</a>  other issue that's come into play is, and it's part of the sort of a result of the pandemic and the supply chain interruption is these trucks to build them now, it's up to 820 days from the time you complete the order to the time the truck arrives. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1004.379s">So</a>  that's a little over two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1006.761s">And</a>  then if you add in the time it takes to <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1010.85s">put</a>  radios in them, tablets, letter them, train the personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1015.151s">You're</a>  talking two and a half years before you're gonna see them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1020.132s">And</a>  that keeps going up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1021.872s">Every</a>  time we wait, if we don't get it done, another month goes by, it's another month, and then we end up having to wait longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1030.514s">So</a>  that's why we were forced to kind of repair these older trucks to kind of keep the fleet operational. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1036.916s">And</a>  that's where we're at with the fleet.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1039.872s">If</a>  you have any questions, I'll yeah, so I know that one of some of the residents are asking that why is there a Boston truck and I don't know if we said maybe there was a fire and they were covering and then someone said what happened with the Boston truck was.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1054.636s">When</a>  we experienced the two major component failures on the other two trucks, I was forced to borrow a truck from Boston. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1061.799s">And</a>  they were gracious enough to give it to us for a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1065.16s">And</a>  they do that for other departments in the metro fire area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1069.582s">I</a>  have a good relationship with the chief and the mechanics in Boston, and they support us if I call them for something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1076.704s">As</a>  long as they have something available, they'll lend it with the idea that they may need it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1082.529s">If</a>  I get that phone call, I have to give it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1084.411s">So</a>  it saved us from browning anything out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1086.672s">We</a>  basically were running that Boston truck for a period of time.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1090.916s">So</a>  this, I'll say it, Chief, this seems dire. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1097.401s">This</a>  should have been something that this administration should have asked for two years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1103.055s">And</a>  this is something that is, do we have a representative from the administration?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1109.642s">We</a>  have Neil Osborne, but I'm not seeing anyone.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1112.345s">Okay,</a>  so that's a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1114.026s">So</a>  I look at that because usually when you present a capital plan like this, it's in the capital projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1122.992s">We</a>  haven't seen, have we got an update? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1126.214s">So</a>  I know that, you know, I know that the mayor put out that the station, Main Street stations now going under this, that, and the other thing, and that's great, but these are the things that frighten me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1137.399s">This</a>  is great if we have a brand new fire station, but, you know, are we gonna be, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1143.339s">you</a>  know, rent in a U-Haul truck and throwing some ladders on the top, because we don't have fire engines. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1148.161s">So</a>  that's what I fear right now, because as you're saying, two and a half years away, and we're in discussions about ordering them, I think this council needs to play a bigger role in this, Chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1161.507s">I</a>  think that we need to make a motion that we need to have an emergency meeting, as committee of the whole, with procurement office, with the mayor, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1171.611s">And</a>  really, let's try to figure out a way to get this audit sooner than later. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1177.444s">I</a>  mean, I don't, I know it's not <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1182.022s">It's</a>  not a popular thing, it's tough to be up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1183.783s">I</a>  know it is, but from here, I know how dangerous your jobs are, and not to have the proper equipment that you need, whether it's turnout gear, whether it's fire trucks.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1195.311s">I</a>  literally, just so I can stop you for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1198.633s">Maybe</a>  I wasn't clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1199.514s">Okay,</a>  so when we, the mayor and I discussed this, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1204.637s">It</a>  takes a period of time for manufacturers to quote that price, you know, the price of the apparatus and that lead time that I was just telling you about that constantly changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1214.986s">And</a>  now they're only guaranteeing that for 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1217.548s">So</a>  every time, if we go beyond the 30 days, it has to be recorded and then that takes time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1222.552s">So</a>  I recently, like two days ago, handed the mayor all the updated information on the price quote, the lead time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1230.738s">And</a>  we are in discussions, like I said, on figuring out how we're going to fund that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1237.062s">And</a>  that comes from her staff and her, not me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1241.224s">I</a>  just give her the information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1244.226s">you</a>  know, she has to make that commitment where that's gonna be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1247.749s">And</a>  then once I get that, I can actually order the truck and get that clock ticking.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1251.772s">Chief,</a>  I appreciate everything you do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1253.333s">I</a>  know this is nothing on you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1255.055s">What</a>  I'm saying, sitting here, we've ordered fire trucks in the past with Chief Gilberti and this administration, the administration prior to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1262.741s">So</a>  originally this council was involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1265.763s">That's</a>  what I'm trying to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1267.004s">If</a>  we're waiting for the 30 days and you're sitting with the mayor and she's putting something together with other different departments, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1273.129s">Guess</a>  who they have to come to to ask for the money? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1275.232s">They</a>  have to come here and we know nothing about it.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1278.296s">I'm</a>  sure there's other department heads that are all asking for their stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1281.099s">So</a>  she's looking at an entire city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1282.722s">I'm</a>  just looking at one.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1284.444s">As</a>  a city councilor, what I'm saying, this is what I'm telling you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1287.287s">You</a>  don't have to. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1288.249s">I'm</a>  telling you what I see. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1290.151s">is</a>  that I don't care what other departments don't have paperclips. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1294.054s">Our</a>  firemen, firewomen don't have the equipment they need to succeed and be safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1298.898s">So</a>  I know it's not it's not popular for you to say it, but I can say it chief and it's okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1303.242s">But</a>  I will tell you we need to have an emergency meeting with the mayor to see where this council falls in to make sure we're in the loop to make sure that we can hold meetings <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1313.07s">to</a>  clear any funding that we have to approve to make sure this happens within 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1318.878s">That's</a>  all I'm trying to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1320.4s">And</a>  I'm only saying this because I'm in your corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1323.764s">I</a>  want to support your people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1328.009s">This</a>  is something that <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1329.591s">working</a>  here for 16 years, whether on the school committee, city council, we've been directly involved when we talked about the previous fire trucks or different, different, uh, you know, uh, expenditures that we put out, whether it was for police cars or a new station or whatnot, but we were involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1347.681s">This</a>  council has yet to see updated financials. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1350.802s">So</a>  we're, we're, we're nervous chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1353.203s">I'm</a>  nervous that we're going to get to me and we're going to come here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1356.005s">I'm</a>  going to say, forget the fire trucks, George. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1358.944s">We</a>  might have to cut firemen or firewomen, and I don't want that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1362.285s">This</a>  is what I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1363.125s">We</a>  need to get together with the chief, with the mayor's office, and really start, because they've gone publicly to different arenas, and they publicly mentioned how awful the budget's gonna be this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1375.709s">And</a>  listen, I'm publicly saying this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1377.749s">I've</a>  said it a thousand times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1379.05s">I'm</a>  sounding redundant to everybody, and I sound like a crybaby at times, but I'm frightened. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1384.711s">I'm</a>  nervous, because I don't know what we're doing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1387.54s">This</a>  council hasn't talked to anybody about what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1390.782s">So</a>  thank you for coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1392.664s">Thank</a>  you for the update. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1393.744s">My</a>  recommendation is that we make motion that we call for an emergency meeting with the mayor's office to get an update on the capital plan dealing specifically with ordering the fire trucks within this 30-day window so the clock can start now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1407.914s">Does</a>  2020 code that, Chief? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1410.256s">2020</a>  trucks? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1413.098s">And</a>  the possibility is we have to make them last for at least another two and a half years if the clock started today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1418.139s">So</a>  that's why we need to get the clock started. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1420.119s">We</a>  need to do whatever we need to do as a council to jump ahead of anything needed that this council needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1426.52s">So</a>  whatever we can do, that's all I'm asking, Chief, is to get the administration to sit down with us and say, whatever we need, let's get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1434.562s">Let's</a>  understand if we can use our money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1436.222s">Let's</a>  see if we can, you know, what other funding mechanisms we can use. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1441.303s">to</a>  make sure this happens right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1442.785s">That's</a>  that's all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1443.685s">I</a>  mean, I'll give you an example. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1446.128s">Sounds</a>  pretty dire. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1447.409s">We're</a>  down a few a few trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1449.811s">We</a>  have a we have a motion later on resolution today for another $1.5 million in sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1455.116s">What?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1456.618s">I</a>  don't we haven't even know we don't know where the last 1.5 went last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1460.161s">So</a>  before I these are the issues that we don't know about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1463.503s">That's</a>  why I asked you to come up and I know it's I know and I don't make I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable in any way chief. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1468.507s">Yeah,</a>  you're doing an amazing job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1470.809s">Yeah,</a>  you have one of the best departments in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1474.912s">I</a>  know and I speak firsthand for the way they treated my mom and my dad when they when they were leaving the service. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1480.176s">So</a>  I can't say enough about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1482.618s">So</a>  but <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1485.694s">We</a>  know, we can see the issues, but we haven't heard anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1488.537s">That's</a>  why having you come up and just shed some light, I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1491.301s">So</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1492.082s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1498.569s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1499.41s">Chief.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1504.437s">I</a>  know in the past, I think our last one, didn't we do a lease to own on our last two fire trucks?</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1510.781s">We</a>  did lease purchase on both ladders. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1512.482s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1513.083s">And</a>  tied them with the casino money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1515.464s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1516.365s">So</a>  they did a 10-year lease on each truck, and that money each year pays for the lease purchase. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1521.689s">It's</a>  a 10-year lease purchase.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1523.25s">So</a>  I'm assuming we're going to look to do the same thing going forward?</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1527.172s">That's</a>  a question you have to ask the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1529.494s">It</a>  all depends on how they want to fund it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1531.495s">There's</a>  many different ways they could choose to fund it.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1535.177s">And</a>  I know between you and the former chief how long it takes to get these trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1541.219s">Say</a>  that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1542.139s">I</a>  said I know between yourself and the former chief how long it takes to get a fire truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1546.5s">I</a>  know it takes almost.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1548.32s">So</a>  that's what I was trying to explain earlier was that that time frame keeps changing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1554.282s">So</a>  at the end of 30 days, say a bunch of departments order 50 trucks, that could turn into 900. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1560.463s">It</a>  could just keep going up because you get behind in the line.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1565.137s">And</a>  I thank Councilor Scott for bringing that up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1566.938s">And</a>  what does she mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1567.539s">Because</a>  the three workhorses in the community are the police, fire, and DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1573.504s">And</a>  what about those three departments?</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1576.406s">So</a>  like for example, the ladder trucks, they took 400 days back then. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1581.01s">But</a>  since the pandemic and the supply chain interruption and material shortages, all the departments are in the same kind of problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1588.716s">They're</a>  trying to get trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1590.337s">And</a>  what happens is that lead time just keeps going up and up and up as more and more departments order. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1596.882s">And</a>  like I said, that supply chain interruption, we're still seeing the effects of that.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1604.246s">market?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1604.986s">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1605.827s">Right</a>  now, we looked around, there's nothing around. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1607.948s">I</a>  mean, I don't know.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1609.129s">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1609.629s">Obviously,</a>  obviously entertain that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1611.971s">Yeah,</a>  like, we borrow from Boston, I even tried to buy one of those. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1617.674s">Just</a>  too precious. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1618.454s">They're</a>  not letting go of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1619.795s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1620.195s">So</a>  and then there's nothing around. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1621.396s">We</a>  just we looked around. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1622.497s">There</a>  really isn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1623.838s">Everyone's</a>  in the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1624.958s">It's</a>  not just Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1626.039s">It's</a>  not a whole metro fire community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1629.901s">You</a>  know, we try to see if we could, you know, like, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1633.905s">work</a>  on a purchase for some of those used trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1637.267s">And</a>  even though they're not ideal, when we have a component failure on the two older 23-year-old trucks, that's not something ideal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1645.472s">I</a>  didn't want to fix those, but I had to because I couldn't find anything better used. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1650.255s">We</a>  knew exactly what those were. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1652.648s">And</a>  it was, it was a lot of money, but you know, I had enough in the budget that I could absorb it, but it took up over half my maintenance budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1658.993s">So</a>  what's going to happen in the summer when we got a maintenance stuff, we're going to get, it's going to be very tight this year because of those failures. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1666.7s">So,</a>  um, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1669.09s">You</a>  know, that's, and the other issue that happens is if you don't have spares, you can't maintenance the fleet.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1674.071s">That's</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1674.571s">So</a>  it's not like I'm, you know, adding an extra truck so I can have extra trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1678.152s">It's,</a>  you know, if engine one needs maintenance, you gotta have something to back it up.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1681.373s">Yeah,</a>  no, and I understand, you know, when they go off for repairs, they're out there for a couple of months.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1686.395s">So</a>  the other issue that's happening is we're running, our run totals went way up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1690.896s">So</a>  we went from, say, under 10,000 to over 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1694.477s">We're</a>  almost 13,000 runs a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1696.898s">So</a>  now engine one, for example, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1699.266s">73,000</a>  miles on it already. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1701.47s">So,</a>  you know, it's a 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1704.156s">So</a>  think about that, you know, those trucks are in two and a half years, they're going to have almost 100,000 miles on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1711.212s">So</a>  that's the other issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1712.652s">We're</a>  trying to get them ordered so we can rotate the fleet. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1715.093s">Like</a>  in the past, we'd get them in before they got, like say they get to 40,000, then we rotate them and the new stuff comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1721.574s">But</a>  because of this huge two and a half year delay, engine one and engine four, they're gonna run to the point where they're gonna have almost 100,000 on them when we go to rotate.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1732.876s">And</a>  you know, I would hope that, you know, going forward that, you know, the plan would be to, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1739.992s">As</a>  soon as we buy one and get it delivered, we order another one just to keep rotating.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1747.116s">Some</a>  cities have, like I put some stuff into the CIP. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1750.658s">If</a>  you look at it, it's there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1753.52s">You</a>  know, to buy one a year till we get three of them or buy three up front. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1757.402s">There's</a>  different options you can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1759.229s">But</a>  with the delay, if you buy one a year, so we would get the first one in 25, and then the second one would come in 26, and then 27, you'd start to see some relief. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1769.637s">But</a>  in other cities, what they do is they don't keep trucks this long. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1772.98s">They</a>  have city ordinances where they, every so many years you buy a pump, and every so many years you buy a ladder. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1780.385s">Before</a>  they get to that age where they're having those major component failures that I was talking about.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1786.67s">Maybe</a>  that's an ordinance that we look to put in going forward.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1789.971s">I</a>  thank you for- Yeah, maybe going forward we can present those kind of ideas, look into what other cities do and come up with a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1796.973s">But</a>  right now we're kind of in an emergency mode. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1799.134s">We've</a>  got to kind of correct what's wrong here first.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1801.914s">And</a>  let me say, your department, lives matter in your department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1806.256s">You</a>  save lives. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1806.896s">So</a>  I would hope that we can get this emergency meeting in so you can get your 30 days and get it off and going because they say, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1816.101s">two</a>  years.</p>

    <p>[Freedman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1817.902s">I</a>  do have to say this is that we were literally talking today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1821.404s">We're</a>  going to work on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1822.344s">So</a>  I think what we just need to do is guys, if you want to be involved, we'll just stop talking.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1826.766s">We</a>  can do a little more work and a little more action. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1829.468s">I'm</a>  going to say also, I'm going to support councilor Scott's motion to have an emergency meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1834.15s">So,</a>  you know, you can get that order up there as quick as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1836.971s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1837.252s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1837.632s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1839.973s">Any</a>  further discussion from the councilors on this part of the resolution? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1845.458s">And</a>  back to you, Councilor Scott Peli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1847.719s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1848.239s">Is</a>  Mr. Osborne present?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1849.4s">He</a>  is.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1850.22s">He</a>  is online.</p>

    <p>[Osborne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1856.702s">Good</a>  evening, Council President Morell and other members of the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1862.465s">I</a>  know back in early February, I was asked to summarize the issue with a few firefighters. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1870.187s">I</a>  don't know if Councilor Scott Peli has a specific question or any other. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1875.013s">Members</a>  of the Council have questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1877.336s">I</a>  know since then when the issue was brought to my attention, we have improved our communication with new hires. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1884.766s">Initially</a>  back in February we were asking them to come to City Council, come to Human Resources to make an appointment to make sure the paperwork got done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1893.857s">done</a>  timely. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1895.359s">We</a>  have now set specific time frames when a new person is hired, it doesn't matter whether it's fire, DPW or police, there's a specific time frame where they're going to come, meet with the benefits coordinator so that anyone who actually wants the city insurance can sign up for it and have it be filed with GIC in a timely manner so that they can actually have coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1920.289s">Again,</a>  I don't know if there's any specific question that you would like to have answered, available to answer anything that I can.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1926.291s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1928.012s">I</a>  appreciate the response. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1930.072s">And</a>  I think probably my biggest question is that, I know the fire was first brought up, but since then, I was told that there might be some concerns with new hires at DPW, and new hires with the police department, and the lack of truly, lack of true communication with going back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1949.259s">that</a>  you sent us a clarifying email, and I appreciate that, but I have a question on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1956.942s">It</a>  seems that the comment that when open enrollment is closed, there's no way to get anybody on, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1964.646s">Is</a>  that correct?</p>

    <p>[Osborne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1965.985s">It's</a>  extremely difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1967.407s">Again,</a>  we are a member of GIC. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1970.37s">They</a>  are the gatekeepers, and we do our best to try and make sure that any employee who is new to us has the opportunity to sign up.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=1981.098s">So</a>  just so you know, Mr. Osborne, I did contact a couple of neighboring communities and talked with the benefits managers, and I know that they have different systems set up that it's a 60-day waiting period once they are hired, no matter what month of the year it is, that if they were hired in January and February, they would then be, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2004.543s">added</a>  on to the insurance for GIC on April 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2007.546s">That's</a>  for example. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2008.907s">Another</a>  example is February to March. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2011.409s">They</a>  would then be hired May 1st. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2012.97s">They</a>  would have the GIC. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2015.252s">I've</a>  talked to a few people in a few HI departments that have also told me that it's not uncommon <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2023.178s">for</a>  a relationship with the members of GIC and I have a call with them tomorrow to just give them a call and say, hey, listen, be a little persistent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2032.524s">I</a>  believe one benefits person told me that all she really needs to do is call them three times in a day and they'll get somebody on if it's really needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2041.55s">So</a>  I think that's that, I'm a little confused with what you sent and then what I've heard from GIC itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2049.135s">And</a>  then the other piece is, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2052.654s">are</a>  all the firefighters that were hired. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2055.116s">I</a>  know back in February that wants insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2059.499s">Have</a>  they been given their insurance or are they still waiting for the insurance? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2062.941s">Second</a>  question is, do there's still issues with the police that had some concerns and some issues and with DPW? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2072.547s">If</a>  you can answer that, that'd be great.</p>

    <p>[Osborne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2074.816s">I</a>  guess I can only answer for those who brought that issue to my attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2080.42s">So</a>  the key component of getting someone insurance is for them to sign up for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2084.943s">There's</a>  no automatic way for us in human resources to decide what an individual will want. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2091.627s">So</a>  if they come to us, we can figure out exactly what their needs are and then try and work with them if they don't have insurance to try and get them insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2101.374s">Right</a>  now, I don't know of anyone on the fire that <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2105.597s">wanted</a>  insurance and it's without insurance, doesn't have it.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2109.9s">Okay,</a>  so that's alarming to me because I think that when I hire a new person in my position, I work with my HR benefits coordinator in the HR. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2122.97s">As</a>  they go on to the onboarding process, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2126.325s">the,</a>  this is part of their process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2129.286s">Are</a>  you telling us that when they're going through the onboarding process, when they're hired for the city of Medford, that that's not the job of the HR department to follow through to make sure they're doing that? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2139.73s">Because</a>  you're making it sound that they have to come to you separately and ask for it.</p>

    <p>[Osborne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2144.412s">So</a>  that was back in February, the offer letter specifically said, hey, come make an appointment so that we have the opportunity to figure out what you need, get the paperwork signed and get it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2155.942s">Unfortunately,</a>  back in February, there was a lack of staff that happened that reduced the ability to respond quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2166.852s">But</a>  once the issue was brought to our attention, we began to work with any firefighter that didn't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2172.799s">and</a>  sort of make that request to GIC to see what could be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2177.401s">And</a>  again, from the group that started in February, I don't know of anyone of that group who has come to Human Resources and said, hey, we need help. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2186.845s">And</a>  again, we remain open and available. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2189.147s">Come</a>  talk to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2190.327s">It's</a>  easier if you make an appointment, then we can give you the dedicated time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2193.829s">I</a>  know folks, no matter what department you work in, you can stop in at HR, but you can get better service if you just give us a little heads up.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2204.028s">And</a>  I'm not just putting blame, I know that you seem to be a team of one, Mr. Osborne. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2212.304s">You</a>  know, we're fortunate that we have <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2215.393s">teams</a>  of six to eight that are working where we're onboarding people, at least that's what it sounds like to me, that you're alone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2222.738s">So</a>  that seems to be an issue in itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2227.281s">So</a>  right now, you know, no firemen, that everybody has, I know that I've gotten some calls from firemen that they still haven't had their insurance applied to their benefits, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2244.67s">but</a>  no one's reached out to you to let you know that.</p>

    <p>[Osborne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2247.732s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2247.933s">So</a>  again, I know the union has brought it to our attention and we've asked them if a firefighter has an issue, please bring it to our attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2258.441s">We</a>  can meet with them, figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2260.422s">I</a>  know I've written one of the employees from February saying just to make sure that there was no miscommunication. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2266.687s">If</a>  you have an issue, come talk to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2268.949s">We</a>  can figure it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2269.81s">That's</a>  what our role is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2271.131s">We're</a>  there to try and provide that service. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2273.479s">to</a>  the employees and also assist department heads when they get new employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2277.646s">So</a>  we're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2279.65s">Come</a>  talk to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2280.371s">We'll</a>  gladly do whatever we can to try and help folks out.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2286.405s">If</a>  I can, I know that representatives Buckley and Jones have reached out and mentioned that they would like to come to the meeting and maybe if you can, if there's any way, gentlemen, if you can, just enlighten me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2305.018s">I</a>  was told, I was led to believe that there were firemen and women that were hired back in February that have yet to be granted insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2316.165s">or</a>  offered other avenues to get their own insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2320.869s">So</a>  I just want to make sure that if this is a wrong that we fix it, that <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2327.987s">We</a>  look at the departments that need to get on board to make sure this happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2332.428s">And</a>  I know that the police reached out as well, and representatives from DPW had some same concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2339.93s">And</a>  I guess that since they're not specific to this, I'll call for a separate resolution with the police to understand how that's transpired. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2349.995s">Uh,</a>  if you could shed some light and your members appreciate just name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2354.518s">Walter</a>  Buckley, president of local 1032 Medford firefighters, 347 Salem street. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2359.881s">So</a>  we currently have three members working for the fight apartment that do not have health insurance to the city that one health insurance to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2369.146s">Um,</a>  the first one is Brian Lee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2371.787s">He</a>  received a letter from the city on February 2nd standing yet to meet with H. R. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2379.667s">and</a>  set up an appointment to go over their benefits. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2383.488s">And</a>  I believe the GIC requires you to sign up for insurance within 60 days of your first day of getting paid. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2391.39s">So</a>  he was not, he never made the appointment apparently. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2394.811s">He</a>  got the letter, you have a lot of things running through your head when you're going to the fire academy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2398.752s">You</a>  gotta get your shit together, you have to resign probably from your former job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2403.874s">Ship</a>  together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2405.314s">Ship,</a>  yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2406.695s">One</a>  of them was a sailor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2411.798s">I</a>  know, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2415.319s">It's</a>  not fun being up here for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2418.879s">You</a>  have to buy equipment, clothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2422.06s">You</a>  have to get your life together because you're going away for a couple of months at the academy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2426.701s">So</a>  yeah, maybe it slipped someone's mind that when he got the letter, he didn't sign up for the insurance, but you would think it's the HR department's job to reach out to those members and say, hey, you don't have insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2440.224s">We</a>  need to get your insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2442.298s">They</a>  do require you, the city HR department requires you to provide proof of insurance when you opt out of our insurance, but they don't require proof of insurance in the initial. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2456.148s">So</a>  if you want to opt in, you opt in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2458.85s">If</a>  you don't want the insurance, they don't say, where's your proof? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2462.593s">We</a>  need proof of insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2464.662s">So</a>  to us, it means that they only require proof of insurance when it's gonna cost the city money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2470.685s">They</a>  don't care that you don't have insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2472.225s">They're</a>  not gonna ask you if you have proof of insurance because we have three guys that don't have insurance right now and they never called them and said, hey, you don't have insurance, you need to sign up.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2481.43s">So</a>  if I can interrupt. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2483.13s">So</a>  I know it's a two month period. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2485.091s">So</a>  we figured out in February, they didn't have insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2487.892s">So</a>  they didn't have that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2490.033s">It's</a>  still a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2491.594s">Have</a>  they had that meeting since then?</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2494.599s">All</a>  right, so the first one, Brian Lee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2497.181s">Completed</a>  the paperwork in May of 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2501.644s">Was</a>  told by HR that his paycheck would reflect it in June or July. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2505.987s">Went</a>  back to HR in August. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2507.909s">Was</a>  told to resubmit the paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2510.21s">Went</a>  back to HR in October or November. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2513.252s">Was</a>  told he never handed in the paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2515.814s">And</a>  then was told he did hand in the paperwork, but there was a communication problem with GIC. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2521.929s">In</a>  January of 2023, same individual met with Neil and Candace, was told paperwork was submitted to GIC but delayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2530.636s">Was</a>  told he would have to wait till April 2023 for open enrollment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2535.701s">In</a>  the meantime, he could pay for his outside insurance and he would be reimbursed up to 85% for all costs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2544.608s">Candace</a>  apologized and stated it might have been their fault and Neil landed on the GIC. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2550.933s">Candace</a>  took his information again, said she would write a letter to the GIC because she thought it was their fault. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2558.298s">And</a>  if the paperwork is accepted in April, he won't have any insurance till July of 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2564.001s">So</a>  they're saying right now, if Mr. Lee submits his paperwork in April, he's out of that 60 day period to sign up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2574.288s">They're</a>  saying if it's approved, he'll have insurance in July. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2580.506s">Now,</a>  imagine working for a year and saying, I have no insurance, I have no insurance, I have no insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2586.909s">Open</a>  enrollment comes in and they're telling them, if you get accepted, like, people have families and kids and bills and prescriptions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2597.032s">They</a>  have to deal with this, nevermind the job that we do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2599.493s">We</a>  have to deal with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2602.014s">And</a>  to deal with this administration, and that's one person, Sonny Borelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2606.736s">He</a>  didn't even know he didn't have insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2609.269s">So</a>  he didn't call him up and say, hey, you didn't sign up for insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2611.791s">He</a>  didn't even know until July that he didn't have insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2615.373s">He's</a>  a single guy, so he's probably not thinking, oh, I gotta get my wife and kids and whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2621.177s">So</a>  we contacted him July 1st of 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2624.999s">July</a>  6th, he went to speak with Neil Osborne. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2628.121s">Neil</a>  told him he couldn't help him because the benefits coordinator wasn't in the office and to come back next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2634.945s">July</a>  13th, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2636.485s">He</a>  spoke with Candace and received the health benefits package. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2640.226s">July</a>  20th, he returned the package completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2642.487s">Neil</a>  was in the office. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2645.387s">He</a>  said he didn't want to take it and he was told to come back and give it to Candace. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2650.109s">July</a>  27th, he handed the completed package to Candace. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2653.069s">So</a>  three times he went to the HR and twice he was turned away from the HR director. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2659.011s">I</a>  can't help you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2660.611s">What's</a>  your job if you're the director of HR? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2664.465s">If</a>  you can't help someone when they come in and need help, what's gonna happen to that person when he leaves?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2669.168s">So</a>  more importantly, so July, everything was handed in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2672.991s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2673.551s">August,</a>  September, he should have been on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2675.733s">Is</a>  he on now? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2677.134s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2679.876s">Jeremiah</a>  O'Brien received a letter on August 11th, 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2685.74s">He</a>  was required to meet with HR on August 24th, 2022 at 5.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2688.702s">He</a>  didn't show up to that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2693.288s">But</a>  he did get sworn in on, I believe it was 9-15 or 9-13, where he completed all the paperwork at his swearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2707.072s">He</a>  graduated the academy November 28th of 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2712.011s">December</a>  16th, he went to HR and was told they were working on the issue, and if he was paying for insurance or medical costs, to turn in the receipts and he would be reimbursed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2722.895s">And</a>  he filled out a second healthcare package. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2726.556s">July</a>  29th, he filled out his third healthcare package, was told they are doing their best to get him covered and working with GIC, and that HR would contact him regarding this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2740.612s">January</a>  16th, 2023, he went to HR and was told that he never turned in his paperwork, or that they might have misplaced them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2753.801s">He</a>  was then told it was too late to enroll, but they would contact him when they get an answer from HR regarding this health insurance issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2763.247s">That</a>  was January 16th, no one has contacted him since. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2769.039s">Those</a>  are the three members that do not have health insurance right now, that want health insurance.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2776.782s">So</a>  if I can, Mr. Osborne, if you're still there, I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2784.338s">Obviously,</a>  is there a way that we can, first of all, correct this by helping these three firefighters get their GIC benefits ASAP? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2797.9s">Because</a>  I know that talking to, there's an open pipeline when you express these concerns to GIC directly with issues like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2808.682s">It</a>  takes days to get them on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2810.203s">Is</a>  there any way, do we have that possible in Medford or no?</p>

    <p>[Osborne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2815.356s">Um,</a>  uh, through the, uh, council president, the answer to that question is no. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2820.939s">Um,</a>  I'm not going to go, um, item for item over the misstatements made by, uh, uh, Mr. Buckley. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2829.663s">We</a>  as a human resources department remain committed to helping employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2835.686s">They</a>  may not have, uh, but the city's available insurance, but if they get to us and they talk to us about what they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2844.494s">We</a>  will do our best to help them, which includes having discussions with D.I.C. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2850.5s">If</a>  I could to the chair, please.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2853.263s">We've</a>  we've gone to numerous times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2855.885s">Numerous</a>  people have gone to numerous times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2857.927s">These</a>  people still don't have insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2859.208s">So</a>  how are you?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2863.012s">So,</a>  so, Mr. Osmond, what I'm trying to figure out is if we <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2868.051s">If</a>  we talk with the firefighters that are in question, and they come to your office tomorrow, do we have someone in place that can assist them to make sure that this is corrected and we don't, nothing happens again? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2880.858s">Whether</a>  it's one side or the other right now, I don't care. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2883.56s">I</a>  wanna make sure these firefighters have insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2887.222s">Is</a>  that possible?</p>

    <p>[Osborne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2887.722s">Again,</a>  let's make sure, through the chair, we need to be talking about the same things. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2893.465s">Having</a>  insurance is different from having the city's insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2897.497s">The</a>  group insurance commission controls when someone is eligible for insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2904.099s">We</a>  can't wave a magic wand and make it happen today or tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2908.08s">It's</a>  a process that has to be followed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2909.96s">And</a>  again, I keep saying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2912.761s">Have</a>  the individuals come and speak with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2915.601s">Simply</a>  make an appointment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2916.742s">You</a>  get the dedicated time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2918.826s">We've</a>  got a lot to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2919.867s">We're</a>  trying to manage a lot of different other employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2923.649s">If</a>  the employee needs our service, come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2926.471s">We'll</a>  talk to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2927.692s">We'll</a>  do our level best to resolve any issue.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2932.695s">So</a>  my hope is this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2934.616s">My</a>  hope is that with the leadership of the fire department, that we can reach out to those three firefighters, that they can go to Mr. Osborne's office tomorrow and see what needs to be done right now so we can get that clock <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2947.884s">that</a>  clock ticking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2948.845s">But</a>  I will tell you Mr. Osborne and I can I can have I can share some contacts with you with G. I see that there is a possibility when situations like this arise that you can call them and they can't support you within days that I know we've dealt with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2964.775s">So</a>  what I find more alarming to me is that we don't have a system <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2970.578s">in</a>  our HR department that this isn't a natural onboarding system where they come in, fill out the paperwork, do the GIC stuff together, and that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2982.127s">That's</a>  more alarming to me than anything because this wouldn't have happened if we didn't have a competent system in place like other communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2989.712s">This</a>  isn't odd. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2990.513s">This</a>  isn't new. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=2991.934s">This</a>  is, private entities, as they come in, if you work with a private entity and you walked in and you sat down with the HR directors of that company, that's part of the onboarding system of acquiring healthcare. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3005.058s">That's</a>  probably one of the, after the salary, that's probably the most important thing you're looking at. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3010.519s">So</a>  I think that that's what I'm more alarmed right now is that we don't have that process in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3016.281s">Because</a>  I heard what you said, and what's alarming to me is that you're saying <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3021.641s">let</a>  the people that we're hiring, who, by the way, we're having a very difficult time finding people to work in Medford, that they have to come and search for you so they can get the benefits that they are required to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3035.814s">Because</a>  every city employee <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3038.676s">is</a>  required to the option of GIC. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3041.38s">So</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3041.901s">I</a>  don't want to get in between what was said here, what was said there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3048.43s">I</a>  really don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3049.292s">What</a>  I want is these three firefighters <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3052.543s">to</a>  get their insurance as quickly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3055.426s">And</a>  if you'd like to, I'll share that tomorrow with the information that I can get to you, that there's contacts at GIC that I've worked with directly that can help with onboarding special situations, like seems to be this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3069.439s">So</a>  this is, from what I gather, I'm not confused. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3073.715s">From</a>  what I was told, Mr. Osborne, is that all three firefighters that are having issues all wanted the GIC and the city's insurance, correct?</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3085.86s">All</a>  of them have been to HI. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3087.68s">All</a>  of them have communicated to the union multiple times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3091.602s">We</a>  were never told, come in right now, we'll get you signed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3095.683s">They</a>  were told, go get your own insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3099.318s">We'll</a>  reimburse you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3100.278s">Okay,</a>  so for today, what I would love to do is get these three firefighters there tomorrow with our benefits officer and our HR director, and let's get the clock started tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3114.323s">Let's</a>  get them get their insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3115.843s">And</a>  moving forward, we need to figure out what we want.</p>

    <p>[Buckley]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3120.905s">So</a>  the chair, excuse me, but for decades, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3124.315s">You</a>  came in, you swore in, you signed up for your health insurance, and then you went home. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3129.18s">You</a>  weren't allowed to go home unless you signed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3131.522s">So</a>  that was common practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3132.684s">So</a>  that changed a couple years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3136.223s">Now</a>  again, when you go into HR, you expect help, especially from the HR coordinator. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3141.927s">If</a>  he says his secretary's not here and I can't help you, come back next week, that's not a great answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3146.85s">And</a>  he's calling me a liar. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3148.511s">I</a>  have an email from right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3151.452s">Despite</a>  our efforts to encourage them to make an appointment to meet with us, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3156.061s">about</a>  health coverage needs, we have not heard from either Firefighter Borelli or Firefighter Dominique. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3162.705s">I</a>  just told you of three different times that Borelli went to HR and Neil himself told him, can't help you, secretary's nodding, come back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3174.991s">Didn't</a>  mistake that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3177.633s">Those</a>  are your words, not mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3180.514s">The</a>  fact that these guys are still over a year and a half now, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3185.197s">They</a>  won't have coverage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3185.898s">If</a>  they get it today, they won't have coverage till July. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3188.039s">They'll</a>  be out a year and a half of insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3192.842s">It's</a>  unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3194.663s">Our</a>  members deserve better. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3196.444s">The</a>  city deserves better. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3199.466s">There</a>  should be some kind of proof of insurance when you get hired by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3203.309s">If</a>  you're not going to take their insurance, you need to prove that you have insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3208.192s">The</a>  state requires it when you file your taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3210.994s">The</a>  city doesn't require it when you <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3213.251s">when</a>  you join their health coverage or you opt out of it, they require it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3219.296s">In</a>  order to go for, if you guys know, in the GIC, there's an opt out. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3224.54s">We</a>  get a benefit of $2,000 for a single, $4,000 for a family. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3229.985s">If</a>  you wanna opt out of the insurance, you have to prove that you have insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3235.749s">But</a>  if you get hired, you don't have to prove that you're insurance if you don't want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3239.953s">So</a>  they only care when it costs them money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3241.934s">You</a>  have to prove it.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3243.936s">That</a>  tells you the city doesn't care about us, but they only care about money, this, it's a little confused because I know that as as a negotiator on when we were as a teacher, and we negotiate we're one of the first, I believe back in the days, we were on the negotiating team when we were <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3260.029s">picking</a>  the government insurance process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3262.71s">And</a>  I know that we, that's one of the things with the teachers onboarding system that's done right away. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3269.234s">So</a>  I think that that's something this council, I would make an emotion that we ask that we see the onboarding system that's used in practice today. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3280.42s">and</a>  our HR department and then review to see how we can correct these issues so we don't have people or families without insurance without knowing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3289.902s">So</a>  I think that'd be important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3292.463s">I'd</a>  make that as a form of motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3294.404s">And</a>  then I'd also make a form of motion that requests that <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3300.285s">that</a>  HR director reach out to these three firefighters directly and call for an emergency meeting with them ASAP so we can get that clock started so they're insured through the city as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3314.355s">So</a>  again, I don't, I don't, personally, I don't, it's not hearsay. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3320.62s">I've</a>  worked with the GIC often. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3324.175s">This</a>  is not a year-long process. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3326.656s">This</a>  is if you go through different benefits departments, they have charts that are set up that shows you if you're hired, and these dates, these are the dates that you'll be on board. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3338.201s">They're</a>  given, they're, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3340.322s">I'm</a>  not going to share with you, but this is one communities that they share with the person that's hired. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3345.484s">This</a>  is it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3346.245s">This</a>  is your date. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3347.405s">You're</a>  hired in this date. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3348.526s">Expect</a>  to have your G. I. C. On this date. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3351.007s">So</a>  that's something we need to correct on the city side to make sure this doesn't happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3355.569s">So,</a>  um, again, this is this is alarming, but I think it's something we need to correct as soon as possible.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3361.532s">Madam</a>  President, any further discussion from Councilors? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3366.514s">Any</a>  other members of the public would like to speak?</p>

    <p>[Bob Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3369.48s">I'd</a>  like to speak if I may.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3370.641s">Sure,</a>  name and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3400.643s">Mr.</a>  Osborne, would you like to answer that?</p>

    <p>[Osborne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3404.01s">I</a>  don't have an answer for that.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3406.058s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bob Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3406.638s">I'll</a>  tell you a minimum of six times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3409.539s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3410.219s">I</a>  did not document the times and dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3412.84s">The</a>  last time I was there, we spoke to Candace. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3415.62s">You</a>  were in a Zoom meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3416.741s">I</a>  asked for her to have you give me a call back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3419.441s">I'm</a>  still waiting for the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3421.582s">These</a>  firefighters have been to your office numerous times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3425.143s">There</a>  were no misstatements by President Buckley because I was present for most of these meetings. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3430.424s">We</a>  have discussed this, as you requested, multiple times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3435.492s">So</a>  for us to have to go there again, we'll do it one more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3439.373s">We'll</a>  be there tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3441.733s">You</a>  name a time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3443.533s">And</a>  when we leave your office tomorrow, these three firefighters will have insurance through the GIC, whether you do it or I have to do it myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3451.135s">I</a>  request the paperwork that the GIC requires to sign them up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3456.496s">So</a>  let me rephrase the question, Mr. Osborne. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3460.296s">Have</a>  I been to your office regarding this issue with these firefighters?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3465.188s">I</a>  mean, this is an interrogation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3466.749s">I</a>  understand your approach, but Mr. Osborne, it's not interrogation.</p>

    <p>[Bob Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3470.172s">It's</a>  a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3471.793s">It's</a>  happening.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3473.894s">I</a>  understand that it's through the chair.</p>

    <p>[Bob Jones]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3474.975s">I'm</a>  the chair through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3476.456s">He's</a>  saying that President Buckley has made misstatements. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3480.479s">I</a>  was present for these events. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3482.761s">They're</a>  not misstatements. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3485.083s">It's</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3487.745s">I</a>  would just like for these firefighters to have insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3490.346s">There</a>  are other employees, police, DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3493.587s">This</a>  is not an issue that's specific to the fire department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3497.428s">It's</a>  specific to all city employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3500.529s">I'd</a>  love to get these people covered. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3502.29s">And</a>  if we were never told about a GIC exclusionary 60 day wait period, we've always been told, fill out the paperwork, we're working on it, we will get back to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3513.573s">So</a>  that was a misstatement by Mr. Osborne. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3517.352s">I</a>  will see you in your office tomorrow now with these three firefighters looking forward to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3522.539s">Probably</a>  about 10 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3523.761s">How's</a>  that sound?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3525.743s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3526.484s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3528.066s">I</a>  can just just final question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3530.85s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3533.294s">I</a>  have those motions in place, but if Mr. Osborne can answer, are we having similar issues with fire and DPW as well, and other departments?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3544.661s">Do</a>  you mean police and DPW?</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3545.581s">Police,</a>  excuse me, police and DPW, any other departments that, so we can correct that as well.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3550.904s">Mr.</a>  Osborne, can you speak to that?</p>

    <p>[Osborne]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3553.065s">No</a>  employee that's met with us has informed me that they are without insurance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3558.228s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3559.869s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3563.191s">Any</a>  other members of the public wishes?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3740.745s">Thanks,</a>  Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3744.686s">Just</a>  a quick summary this is we've discussed this many times now over the past three years and committee and subcommittee This is a proposal to create an affordable housing trust for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3754.109s">This</a>  would create a trust of the provisions of state law where <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3759.477s">City</a>  funds private funds etc could be pulled for the benefit of creating more affordable housing in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3769.082s">This</a>  has been reported out of committee, just the latest updates. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3775.41s">Motion</a>  when this is reported on a committee in November was to request comments from Greater Boston Building Trades. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3780.633s">They</a>  have submitted a letter of comment through the Greater Boston Labor Council, which was included in our packets last week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3787.997s">I</a>  also have distributed a short, there's two minor technical amendments that need to be made here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3794.621s">I</a>  just caught a couple of typos when I was reading through the, well, caught a couple of typos and a couple of typos were brought to my attention looking through the ordinance on the agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3805.094s">I'm</a>  happy to present them, but there's one in section 49-52, which the <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3812.668s">Number</a>  four should be replaced with the remaining members. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3815.09s">It</a>  says the board shall be composed of seven members, but then it says one shall be the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3819.333s">One</a>  may be a member of the Community Preservation Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3821.614s">And</a>  then it says four, that would only add up to six or maybe even five if the may of the Community Preservation Committee members considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3828.839s">So</a>  I just proposed a technical amendment to strike the number four and replace it with the words, the remaining members. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3837.355s">And</a>  then in section 49-54, subsection 11, just clarifying language here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3847.506s">that</a>  we had put into the ordinance, just to explain that borrowed by the trust shall pledge any borrowing that pledges more than 70% of the cash assets of the trust for Park City Council approvals. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3861.93s">It</a>  was just a little bit confusing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3864.251s">And</a>  I talked that over with planning development and sustainability. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3867.552s">So</a>  I would move to amend <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3873.137s">the</a>  ordinance to reflect those two technical amendments, which all Councilors should have and the clerk should have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3880.924s">And</a>  I would also move to attach the letter of comment received from the Greater Boston Labor Council and require the trustees to incorporate the language provided by the Greater Boston Labor Council into the rules and regulations of the Affordable Housing Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3895.637s">And</a>  so that would be the language that we received back regarding project labor agreements.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3902.163s">for</a>  those folks at home who do not have this in front of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3904.927s">Could</a>  you please read the amended language for section 49-5411 just so sure it was read. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3916.909s">I</a>  know it's just, it's like a conjugation change and insertion of one word.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3919.67s">It</a>  clearly reads any borrowing by the trust that pledges, any borrowing by the trust pledging more than 75, 70% of the assets of the trust requires city council approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3929.934s">The</a>  change would be any borrowing by the trust that pledges more than 70% of the cash assets of the trust requires city council approval.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3937.457s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3940.999s">So</a>  we have those two amendments by, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3945.649s">Vice</a>  President of Affairs.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3946.77s">And</a>  I would propose those amendments and to approve the ordinance for first reading.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3950.631s">Motion</a>  to sever. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3951.892s">I'm</a>  sorry, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3956.134s">Motion</a>  to sever the amendments.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3957.654s">Okay,</a>  motion to sever the amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3962.837s">Take</a>  the amendments completely separate or just separate from all yet?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3966.458s">Separate.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3967.899s">Just</a>  one by one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3968.479s">Okay,</a>  that's fine.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3974.594s">So</a>  we have those before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3975.494s">I</a>  know there's a number of members of the public who would like to speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3977.575s">Any</a>  councilors who would like to speak at this time? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3981.937s">Councilor</a>  Collins and then Councilor Osanic.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3985.318s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell, and thank you, Vice President Bears for continuing to work with council leadership and city staff to get this ordinance into the version that we're voting on for first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=3998.962s">Tonight,</a>  another many years of hard work has gone into this ordinance predating my tenure on this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4005.966s">I</a>  think it's about time in many ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4008.627s">This</a>  has been a work product spread out over many years with input from many local and regional housing experts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4017.052s">And</a>  what's most important to me is that there is a incredibly demonstrated need for <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4024.704s">affordable</a>  housing in Medford and mechanisms for creating affordable housing in Medford and repositories for funding for affordable housing in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4033.029s">There's</a>  already a discrepancy between the people who are eligible for affordable or subsidized housing and how much of that type of housing that we already have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4041.434s">So</a>  in a lot of ways, creating an affordable housing trust is really just a preliminary step, but it's one I'm glad we're finally taking. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4047.197s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4049.378s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4050.139s">Councilor</a>  Sack.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4051.118s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4052.84s">This,</a>  the Affordable Housing Trust Fund is something that experts and residents have been working on and clamoring for for a very long time in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4062.812s">I've,</a>  especially in the last few weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4066.596s">There's</a>  been a lot of pressure on us rightfully so to get this done and dusted, and this ordinance, you know, has has been in the works for many years as Councilor Collins has stated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4080.807s">And</a>  it's finally time to do something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4083.469s">I</a>  think when we think about the crises that are immediate to our, to our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4089.534s">There</a>  are many, but housing is first and foremost for many if not for many residents and it touches many if not all of our residents here as a young person who wants to stay in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4102.744s">This</a>  is, you know, the type of action that we need to see our city government investing in doing to make sure that young folks can stay in Medford to make sure that people who want to buy houses can buy houses. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4115.513s">and</a>  to really tackle the regional housing crisis challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4120.216s">So</a>  I'm happy to support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4122.898s">I'm</a>  glad that we were able to iron out a lot of the details, and while I think, and we said this last week about the ordinances that we passed last week, you know, there are going to be small things that people want to see changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4137.548s">I</a>  think this represents <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4139.369s">us</a>  as a council, listening to the experts, listening to the unions, listening to our stakeholders in this project, really giving them time to work out the kinks and the details, and coming back with a product that I think we can be proud of.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4156.599s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4157.419s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4159.0s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4160.441s">First</a>  of all, I'd like to withdraw my motion to seven amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4164.355s">And</a>  second Council business motion to approve the first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4169.824s">After</a>  taking a how to look at the amendments that he's made I don't see any reason to seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4174.555s">This</a>  is something that I think we need to also thank our friend john Falco for because Council Falco was the person that kicked this off. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4182.481s">And</a>  this wouldn't have gotten as far as it had if it weren't for john's diligence and john's work on this particular issue when he served as a member of the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4191.607s">So</a>  with that being said, Madam President, I support the paper and I thank the gentleman for his amendments.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4196.448s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4197.789s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4198.67s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4199.892s">As</a>  I hear from people and I hear from businesses that want to locate into Metro, one of the concerns is if we're going to have enough housing for their employees as they move here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4210.763s">So</a>  I would hope that this ordinance will help alleviate some of those things and hopefully drive some more housing into our market.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4220.848s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4222.068s">Back</a>  to Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4223.229s">I</a>  think Councilor Caraviello makes a great point there that pro-housing policies are pro-business and pro-growth as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4229.57s">And</a>  if we wanna see a more vibrant economy, this is the type of stuff we need to be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4233.791s">So</a>  I think that's a great point and I just wanted to reinforce it.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4238.272s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4239.493s">President</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4240.373s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4241.273s">I</a>  just wanna second what Councilor Knight said and thanks to former Councilor Falco for advancing this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4248.255s">When</a>  it was first, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4250.242s">On</a>  the agenda and I saw my name next to I said that doesn't seem right I don't think I proposed this in January 2020 but that's because Councilor talk with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4256.489s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4258.391s">Yeah,</a>  and I just, I also want to, I mean, thanks to everyone who worked on this and the council for their support and the many folks who lended their voices to shaping this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4269.528s">all</a>  in City Hall, outside of City Hall, residents, unions, everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4272.91s">And</a>  I agree that I think actually two recent papers, this paper and the housing civilian notification ordinance were brought to this Council by Councilor Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4280.095s">So</a>  I hope he's happy that we are finally finishing some of this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4284.278s">I</a>  know we do have some members of the public who would like to speak both on Zoom and in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4288.421s">I</a>  do see one hand up from Matthew Page Lieberman. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4294.926s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Page Lieberman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4298.422s">Yeah,</a>  I just want to say, though, that Councilor Knight's hand is still up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4301.543s">Does</a>  he need to speak?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4302.643s">I</a>  believe it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4303.363s">I</a>  believe it's remaining up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4304.924s">Councilor</a>  Knight, tell me if I'm wrong, but I think your hand is just still up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4308.145s">Or</a>  do you have something else you'd like to add?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4312.606s">Don't</a>  encourage me, Councilor.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4315.327s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4316.307s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4317.908s">Back</a>  to you, Matthew.</p>

    <p>[Page Lieberman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4319.122s">Oh,</a>  well, it remains to be up the vestigial hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4322.466s">Yeah,</a>  so I mean, this is extremely exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4324.368s">I</a>  know people have been working on for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4326.69s">I</a>  also believe that, you know, Roberta Cameron played a major role in this, getting this off the ground some years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4332.296s">You</a>  know, it's really, really exciting that's finally getting the vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4335.92s">And</a>  I know it's been kind of taken a few months, it seems like there was a little bit of deferring. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4341.926s">to</a>  a union to figure out to get their take on the language and stuff like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4345.508s">And</a>  so, you know, as of Friday, you know, somebody like me, I'm finally able to see the public copy and the preference for I guess what is the project work agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4355.854s">It's</a>  something that I do not have, I do not have a problem with. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4359.637s">But,</a>  you know, I was not able to attend the committee committee the whole meeting in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4364.642s">And,</a>  you know, just based on reading the minutes of that and seeing, you know, this final or prior to the next amendments that we voted on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4373.396s">I</a>  just kind of noticed that I think when we're, if we're kind of seeing, you know, unions and like high paying jobs as a way of addressing, you know, economic injustice, especially here, like in the greater Boston area, if I mean, if we're going to value the unions and understand the role that, you know, unions have played in the history of this country, moving, you know, people doing working class in a middle class, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4394.495s">building</a>  the middle class in this country. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4397.177s">It's</a>  also important to kind of consider that that's not the only part of the picture when we talk about addressing economic injustice. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4405.221s">You</a>  know, for instance, you know, a report came out, it's kind of, it's a little, it's a famous report, some people criticize the numbers and they're trying to reevaluate that, you know, a report came out from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, which was also conducted by Duke University, and I guess the New School, I'm not quite sure, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4423.332s">about</a>  in 2015 that the average white household wealth for greater Boston is $247.5 thousand. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4429.116s">The</a>  average median household wealth for U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4430.577s">born</a>  black people in Boston is eight dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4440.823s">So</a>  I think these kinds of things are things that we should also kind of consider when we're talking about we're thinking about how we're going to address income in wealth injustice in our housing plans and so you know one of the things that would have been nice to add as a preference is to make sure that these kinds of contracts are going out to working class people of color or that we'll be contracting perhaps we could do this in the guidelines <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4464.375s">contractors</a>  that will have some kind of pledge to make sure that they are hiring people that for centuries have been cut out of economic opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=4471.94s">And</a>  especially in the municipal level, we have a lot of power as far as whose contracts we can provide to, who we can kind of help out out of situations like $8 an hour in the whole household wealth. <a

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5255.065s">I</a>  thank you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5257.586s">I,</a>  too, expressed concern early in the whole meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5265.014s">with</a>  no outlook. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5268.45s">or</a>  vision of our finances, I find it very difficult to support any paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5273.713s">And</a>  I know I appreciate all the work that Tim you're doing and your other department heads, but I hope you can understand that as a city councilor that doesn't know the financial climate of our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5288.922s">And</a>  then being given a paper $1.5 million to bond to me is very, very, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5298.728s">unacceptable,</a>  to say the least. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5301.309s">I</a>  think that the other piece that I found alarming is that when we're looking at sidewalk repairs, we've also asked for an update to what the last 1.5 million that I balked at, if we all recall, that we all approved that because we needed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5319.954s">And</a>  to be honest with you, I don't see much work going on on sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5326.267s">and</a>  we've asked for a report of an update and we haven't gotten that either unless I missed that but I haven't gotten an update with that so I <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5336.294s">I</a>  would move to table this until both Councilor Knight's feedback is responded, his motion responded, and we get the update on where that money went for the last one and a half million dollars that we bonded for sidewalk repair, replacement, and stump removal, because I'm still getting a lot of phone calls that sidewalks are a mess, and I haven't seen that list that we've asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5366.866s">So,</a>  I apologize, but that's how I feel.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5372.651s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5373.511s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli asked a question that I brought up in a motion a few months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5380.136s">Where</a>  are we at with the money that we allocated last year? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5384.159s">Do</a>  you know where we at, Senator?</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5387.473s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5390.114s">Thank</a>  you very much, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5393.437s">I</a>  mean, I know that we have a contract open and we started that we did get a late start on last year's round. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5399.101s">But</a>  I think as the council knows, we do request an amount of money every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5403.044s">And</a>  this time we're including some equipment as part of my strategy to move some of this in house. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5410.109s">We</a>  do have a lot of sidewalk work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5412.691s">And</a>  we also have, I think we have about <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5416.511s">Let's</a>  see, $300,000 or $400,000 worth of stump and sidewalk contract that we did last season. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5428.222s">We</a>  still have about $300,000 or so worth of stumps to do, and we have a bunch of the sidewalk to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5436.309s">And</a>  then this would be <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5437.455s">basically</a>  next. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5439.557s">Probably</a>  one of the reasons why it hasn't been seen is because we have so much sidewalk, so much sidewalk work to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5445.802s">Doing</a>  half a million or a million dollars every year of spot repairs hasn't really been a good use of money, in my opinion, in the past. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5453.148s">Owen</a>  and I are working on a much different strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5455.03s">It</a>  started before Owen began, looking at it from a <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5461.722s">how</a>  often are the sidewalks used, so foot traffic, criticality, what are they located near hospitals, schools, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5468.769s">We</a>  had all of our sidewalks evaluated for obstructions and whether or not it's to code. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5473.353s">So</a>  we have an incredible amount of data, which we haven't had in previous years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5476.996s">So</a>  the last round of sidewalk work and then this round of sidewalk work is really focusing on <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5483.342s">the</a>  data, so the hotspots, we call them, and then grouping work so it's not spot repair, so it's efficient. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5490.831s">So</a>  production work as opposed to spot repair work, we could probably get twice as much done for the dollar. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5497.439s">So</a>  that's really our strategy here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5498.58s">$1.5</a>  million, that would include about <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5503.376s">you</a>  know, $350,000, maybe $400,000 worth of equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5507.359s">So</a>  we're working on actually getting that quoted now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5509.881s">So</a>  that would give us a sidewalk grinder in-house so we can take care of two-inch obstructions easily in-house, so we don't have to replace the whole panel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5517.767s">That</a>  will empower in-house work to satisfy a lot of our requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5522.13s">And</a>  then also patching equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5524.092s">So</a>  I'm trying to get us to move or transition from pothole work to hot patch work. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5534.361s">Because</a>  as we move on in the years here, more of our spider cracking is going to open up to potholes, especially with these freeze-thaw cycles. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5542.888s">So</a>  getting our crew up to speed with hot patch repair is a critical part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5550.275s">And</a>  then the sidewalk grinding is a critical part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5552.456s">So</a>  that's the package in front of you at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5555.499s">We're</a>  happy, you know, we understand that loans take readings and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5559.082s">So,</a>  you know, Owen and I are happy to provide the council with whatever information is needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5563.425s">I</a>  do believe, and Owen can correct me if I'm wrong, I do believe we have reported to the mayor the status of all the open contracts up until this moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5572.853s">So</a>  to prepare us for going into the next construction season. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5576.896s">So</a>  if that information hasn't made it to this council yet, I imagine that it's on its way, and I don't know why it hasn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5581.758s">So.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5582.158s">So,</a>  as we're doing the sidewalk, so are we making base handicap accessible also, if need be? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5589.02s">If</a>  need be, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5589.78s">And</a>  so that's one of the focuses that we have, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5592.581s">And</a>  I am glad that, you know, you are purchasing some equipment, but as Councilor Scarpelli and I brought up many, many times, so this is $2 million in two years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5605.37s">I</a>  would like to have seen a sidewalk group doing sidewalks every day here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5612.354s">We</a>  could get there.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5613.955s">We</a>  can't do it all at once, but I share that vision. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5616.937s">I</a>  think we have enough sidewalk work that we could keep them busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5622.04s">Right</a>  now, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5624.039s">You</a>  know, that definitely isn't the cause, but this is a first step in that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5628.683s">We</a>  have asphalt and we have sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5631.705s">In</a>  my personal opinion, and I think Owen would agree with me, our asphalt is at the priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5637.029s">So</a>  we want to get the asphalt equipment first, which is a small spreader, an eight foot spreader, a small grinder, something that we can ride. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5644.375s">That's</a>  for the streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5645.135s">Yes,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5646.916s">And</a>  then the sidewalk grinder, which is also part of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5649.358s">I'd</a>  say 60, I don't know the exact percentage, 60, 70%. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5653.121s">some</a>  high percentage of sidewalk complaints we receive are two-inch heaps and we put it on a list for a sidewalk contract and we spend, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5666.069s">three,</a>  $4,000 to break the panel out, put a new panel in, and then mobilize to a new location. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5671.692s">So</a>  what I'm trying to do is say, well, no, we can just have our in-house crew. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5674.874s">And</a>  so this is step number one, really, to have an in-house sidewalk crew, to get them used to a grinder machine, and then say, okay, we're used to a grinder machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5682.918s">We</a>  already know how to pour panels. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5685.36s">Then</a>  it becomes a question of manpower. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5688.121s">So,</a>  and then, you know, in future budgets, you'll see me here presenting for additional manpower. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5693.744s">Let</a>  me see, sidewalk crew is something that I've been looking for.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5696.506s">Point</a>  of information if I can.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5697.567s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5698.868s">Tim,</a>  I appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5702.611s">As</a>  one councilor, I stood here in my first budget and asked for a sidewalk hot top crew. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5710.537s">We</a>  worked with the neighboring DPW commissioner that put everything into place, a whole funding mechanism, which isn't a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5718.507s">But</a>  the most important thing they said was before we get that equipment, make sure you have enough people that are going to run that equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5725.856s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5726.476s">So</a>  I think we're putting the cart in front of the horse because I think you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5730.862s">We</a>  need our crew. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5731.683s">We</a>  need this equipment, but we need the crew to do it.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5736.144s">Right,</a>  which is why I don't have a whole slate of sidewalk equipment on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5739.228s">That</a>  is why that is the reason why which is why I have one small piece of equipment, because we can we can with our current staffing, we can handle one sidewalk planer, which is what's on there, and we can also what. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5752.422s">It</a>  is, that is an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5753.443s">So</a>  transitioning from hot pothole mix to hot patching is the same crew. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5758.687s">So</a>  instead of two days of potholes, we're going out one day potholes, one day patching. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5763.511s">I</a>  would completely agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5764.792s">You</a>  don't want, you can't, we can't, which is why I don't have a 12 foot spreader on here, you know, and a full size spreader. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5771.077s">I'd</a>  like to see a capital plant, to be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5773.279s">These</a>  are in there, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5775.2s">We</a>  have a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5775.761s">We</a>  have a capital plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5776.742s">I</a>  submitted a request. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5778.084s">I</a>  know the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5779.726s">That's</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5780.186s">So</a>  the whole idea is that truck and the equipment needed with three staff members. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5785.773s">It</a>  wasn't a lot of money considering what we've been putting in for bonds over the last four or five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5790.698s">It</a>  really pays for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5791.839s">So</a>  I applaud your effort.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5793.7s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5793.96s">And</a>  we can't pay obviously pay for personnel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5795.941s">No,</a>  we know, we know. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5797.262s">So</a>  this is a step in together. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5799.364s">And</a>  I will say to there's enough work in the city that we both we need to think about this strategically, it needs to happen, a portion in house and a portion out house, the portion out house, we have a pretty good handle on the portion in house, as we all know, we have obviously some fiscal issues that we're trying to figure out and work through. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5818.356s">figure</a>  out how to best find that and the strategy piece is on my plate to present a strategy so i've been doing i appreciate that it's on the radar now so thank you absolutely absolutely so anyway so jim</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5829.201s">getting</a>  off the side, which is a little speck. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5830.522s">I</a>  don't know, a couple of years ago, myself and Councilor Falco had presented the streets where they grind and pave all the same thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5839.228s">Is</a>  that something where we're gonna look into? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5841.069s">Reclamation</a>  of asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5842.31s">Yes,</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5843.931s">I'm</a>  not saying for the main streets, but maybe we can get some of the, I know when I had met with them, with Councilor Falco, one of the MMA shows, and they had volunteered to come down and do a couple of streets <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5856.139s">It'd</a>  be part of a pilot program. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5857.781s">Is</a>  that something that's being thought of again or is it in your wheelhouse?</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5861.985s">It</a>  is in our wheelhouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5863.106s">When</a>  that first brought up, when I was city engineer, I did review it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5866.79s">I</a>  did get an education on it, especially with recycled content and asphalt life and things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5874.938s">We</a>  have a lot of work to do just with making sure that we're doing maintenance band work, which is things like crack sealing, overlays at the proper time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5889.264s">you</a>  know, to avoid having to rebuild later on, coordinating with utility companies. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5895.948s">So</a>  we have a whole host of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5897.99s">And</a>  I will say that that's an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5900.251s">I</a>  think we're keeping it on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5902.552s">But</a>  it's not something that we have the time and the resources to experiment with at the moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5906.995s">It</a>  would require a little bit more oversight, making sure that it's happening exactly to spec. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5911.699s">It</a>  would be like a special project with the pilot. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5916.202s">The</a>  DPW now in engineering, my focus was just getting us riding the bike before we start doing tricks, if I could put it that way.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5927.732s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5929.933s">That's</a>  embarrassing.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5933.601s">BMX</a>  guy, maybe I like analogies and things like that.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5938.025s">So</a>  hopefully,</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5942.165s">Just</a>  two questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5945.006s">Well,</a>  one comment, one question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5946.227s">One,</a>  I was talking to Steve today, the other day, and he seemed pretty excited about some of the new equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5952.169s">So</a>  that was a good sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5955.491s">Second</a>  piece, just to kind of contextualize this, and just let me know if I'm getting it wrong, the assessment that we did, what, two fiscal years ago now, almost three fiscal years ago now, the sidewalk scope alone was 25, 30 million, right, to get to a state of good repair, maybe even more than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5970.997s">Yeah,</a>  it's a year in the ballpark. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5973.659s">Okay,</a>  so I just wanted to put that out there that, you know, 1.5 million or, you know, to 1.5 million may sound like a lot but it's <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5983.345s">10%</a>  of what our need is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5985.025s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5985.185s">And</a>  that's why it's hard to see too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5986.806s">Yeah,</a>  we believe me, we're out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5988.567s">We're</a>  paying the bills and doing the inspections. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5990.928s">But</a>  just it is hard to see because it is a drop in bucket.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5994.21s">Yeah,</a>  exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=5995.51s">And</a>  kind of just want to again confirm here is when you're talking about, you know, that reflects the revenue issue and the funding issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6002.714s">You</a>  know, we need more people we need more equipment we need to really get at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6006.776s">But</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6007.756s">The</a>  strategy you're talking about just to inform that a little bit more that's also coming partially from the sidewalk assessment of the street assessment as well as some additional research that you've done.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6018.487s">Yeah</a>  the strategy is mostly based off of our assessments and then of course a part of strategy is what do we have for resources, what can we do now, what can we do in year one, what needs to be in year two, what does the capital plan look like and all that so many moving pieces.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6036.262s">And</a>  I don't want to reiterate something you already said but I just want to <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6039.932s">make</a>  sure I'm understanding it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6041.333s">Basically</a>  what you're trying to do is pivot resources so that smaller things that we can address in-house, we have the tools and the capacity to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6049.02s">And</a>  then for the bigger projects, we're focusing on the areas that are most trafficked, where the sidewalks are most used in the city.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6057.688s">I</a>  would say both of those characterizations are correct.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6059.95s">Okay,</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6061.511s">So</a>  I think that really shows that <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6065.325s">To</a>  me, something we always talk about is making sure that given the fact that we have limited resources and a lot of need, we're best using the resources that we currently have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6073.235s">And</a>  it seems to me that that's what your departments are really doing with this situation and what you're asking us for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6080.504s">Obviously,</a>  we have a lot more that needs to be done, but it does seem to be that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6085.069s">you</a>  are trying to acquire the equipment and, you know, put forward the contracts where we can address issues as they happen and address the areas of the city that need help the most. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6098.716s">So</a>  that's a comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6099.516s">You</a>  don't have to respond to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6100.576s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6101.597s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6104.418s">I</a>  know the Councilor Knight has a motion, I believe, that I seconded, but I just wanted to make sure that <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6112.691s">Tim,</a>  it's nothing against you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6113.732s">I</a>  appreciate the hard work you're doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6115.653s">But</a>  again, I think that to my fellow colleagues that we look at the lack of financial transparency and not understanding who we are right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6127.243s">I</a>  think to vote for any money paper right now would be a huge detriment as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6139.735s">I'm</a>  only going to bring this up a thousand times tonight because I think it's important that we're going to get to May and I don't want to say I told you so because the fact that we don't know where we are financially and it's premature to be bringing money papers to this council and asking for things that might end up having a bond for new equipment but the possibility of hiring <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6167.583s">isn't</a>  even on the radar, looking at possible cuts is what I'm afraid of. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6173.947s">This</a>  is what, until we get a clear fiscal vision of where we're going and the understanding, I think it would be really, it would be really reckless for this council to be voting for money papers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6194.011s">you</a>  know, between the lack of legal support that we have, you know, and I think earlier I was so upset because I just keep reading this KP law stuff and all I keep talking to different city solicitors and understanding that every time that phone rings and they pick it up, it's $700 and the clock starts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6213.709s">with</a>  $700 and we don't know where we are financially. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6217.09s">So</a>  again, I'm going to share this a thousand times and I'm going to sound like a broken record, but I'm going to tell you, I think it's irresponsible for us to vote for money papers until we have the proper legal support and knowledge of our fiscal outlook. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6234.778s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6240.438s">Before</a>  we go back to President Bears, Commissioner McGibbon, if we were to table this to get that opinion from the AG, understanding you have contracts open actually from the last bond, would this push back the timing of any work if we were to wait? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6253.147s">I</a>  mean, I hope it wouldn't take us that long to get that opinion.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6257.11s">We're</a>  going to be hitting the streets running this spring. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6261.073s">So</a>  not the sidewalk piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6264.54s">equipment</a>  piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6265.88s">I</a>  just don't know the timelines on that, but it's similar to what Chief Friedman was saying before. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6271.342s">The</a>  equipment backlog and lead time issue is an issue with DPW2. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6277.623s">So,</a>  you know, we're looking at 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6279.704s">I</a>  know he's looking at, we're looking at like 12 for lead times for vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6284.085s">So,</a>  but I, you know, to really respond, if this were, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6289.622s">delayed</a>  for a short period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6291.483s">I</a>  don't think it would, you know, be a critical hit.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6295.224s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6296.024s">So</a>  and then for that equipment piece, we're actually looking at next year, not because of the delay.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6302.026s">The</a>  smaller piece of equipment, we're going to have shortly time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6304.806s">Some</a>  of the longer stuff, like the spreader, for example, may be a little bit longer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6307.967s">Vehicle</a>  builds are about 12 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6310.588s">So</a>  something smaller could, you know, we could be looking at eight, nine months, something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6314.669s">But</a>  across the board, if it's made of steel, I think it's delayed.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6318.735s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6319.396s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6320.897s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6324.139s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, to the point around delaying this, you know, I'd be comfortable tabling for our one meeting and requesting an opinion from the Attorney General. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6334.748s">I</a>  think the other thing we just need to hear, and again, a lot of this is a communication question, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6340.212s">On</a>  the finances, we had what I thought was a good conversation last week with the finance director on the revenue side of finance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6349.039s">I</a>  think the question obviously is going to be on the expense side of finance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6351.981s">And</a>  there's, you know, communication that needs to happen there where, you know, we need, they just need to get us information that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6362.307s">But</a>  in any case, I think the communication issue here is to Councilor Knight's point, we have not heard the administration say that KP Law is functioning as the acting city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6373.072s">Now,</a>  in all senses of all operations of the city, they are obviously serving as the acting city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6382.748s">I</a>  just think we need to get them, somebody from the administration needs to come here and say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6386.31s">So</a>  personally, I would feel comfortable tabling this to our next meeting on March 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6392.993s">If</a>  we want to send it to the Attorney General's office for legal review, that's fine with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6396.235s">I</a>  mean, Bond Council reviewed this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6397.575s">I</a>  believe Bond Council, Jay Gonzalez reviewed this, you know, and that's the Bond Council we've always used. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6403.738s">KP</a>  Law obviously wrote this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6405.439s">If</a>  they're functioning as the acting city solicitor, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6407.98s">I</a>  think we should just need to know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6410.863s">I</a>  hear everyone on the legal question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6413.306s">Quite</a>  frankly, we held the administration to account to fund an assistant city solicitor and the position still is unfilled. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6423.956s">Now,</a>  we can debate why the position's unfilled, sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6429.181s">But</a>  in my view, we won that fight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6433.325s">We</a>  said we want in-house legal counsel and the budget has in-house legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6437.226s">The</a>  question is just bringing the people on in those positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6441.748s">So</a>  I just, I hear what everyone's saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6445.649s">If</a>  the administration would just say whether or not KP Law is serving as the acting city solicitor, I think that would be helpful communication for us to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6453.348s">and</a>  maybe it would change our view and potentially a little bit about who they work for and who they don't work for, because I believe if they are serving as acting city solicitor, they would be working for us too. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6463.615s">But</a>  in any case, I'm happy to support a tabling for one meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6468.578s">And</a>  I would request either request to amend council rights motion or propose a separate motion that we request that the mayor and city administration <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6479.945s">tell</a>  the council whether or not KP law is currently serving as the acting city solicitor for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6485.747s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6486.907s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6489.367s">To</a>  that point, Councilor Benson, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6494.008s">Can</a>  KP law serve as the assistant city solicitor? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6496.709s">Because</a>  based upon the ordinance that this council passed at some point in time, it says there shall be a city solicitor, and there shall also be an assistant. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6504.831s">And</a>  when there is no city solicitor, the assistant shall be appointed solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6509.235s">That's</a>  what the ordinance says. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6511.497s">So</a>  can the mayor unilaterally hire a law firm to work and be compensated at a rate of pay and a scale of pay far outside the compensation schedule that's established by the ordinance? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6524.767s">I</a>  don't think she can. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6525.748s">I</a>  don't think she can appoint a law firm into a position that's defined by ordinance with a salary attached to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6530.925s">And</a>  we have to, at some point, bring this to a head. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6533.947s">You</a>  know, six months ago, seven, eight months ago now, we sat here and we debated a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6538.629s">And</a>  like you said, the mayor said, oh, no problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6540.59s">We're</a>  going to have assistant city solicitor for you guys. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6542.331s">We're</a>  going to post it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6542.991s">It's</a>  going to be an in-house position. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6544.972s">We</a>  still don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6546.233s">And</a>  we still don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6547.134s">That</a>  was all smoke to get the budget passed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6549.335s">You</a>  know, the mayor never had any intention of filling that position because if she did, it would be filled. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6554.057s">Um,</a>  you know, so that's, that's why I raised the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6556.699s">I</a>  mean, we, we have no guidance whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6560.345s">You</a>  know, we're like the clown show, you know, we sit here and we talk and we have great ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6565.79s">And,</a>  you know, we want to follow through and we'd be very productive if we had the tools that were necessary to get the job done, but we don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6573.458s">And</a>  it's very frustrating to not have those tools, especially when we have such a talented group of people that could do such good work, you know? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6581.486s">So,</a>  you know, it's time we bring this thing to a head. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6585.959s">does</a>  the city of Medford require a city solicitor? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6588.4s">The</a>  ordinance says it does. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6589.86s">I</a>  don't know why there isn't one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6591.001s">And</a>  if we don't have one, then there's a problem because there hasn't been one for quite a long period of time, which means that we're operating outside the ordinance, outside the defined parameters of how our government's supposed to operate. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6604.825s">You</a>  know, that's like saying there's supposed to be a secretary of state, but we're just not going to have one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6613.928s">So</a>  that's why I raised it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6615.83s">And</a>  to the point of the paper before us, I support the paper and its theory. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6621.134s">We</a>  need this equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6622.275s">We</a>  need these jobs to be able to be performed in-house. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6626.018s">We</a>  need to get this done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6627.439s">But</a>  we also have $700,000 of a $1.5 million appropriation that we made last year that still remains unspent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6634.365s">You</a>  know, so in that regard, I think that, you know, we're not going to be in that bad of shape to put this off. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6639.969s">You</a>  know, we want to wait a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6641.029s">We're</a>  not going to get a response in a week or two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6642.67s">We're</a>  not going to get a response by March 14th. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6644.551s">You</a>  know, you know, it's going to take at least 30 days to get a legal response from the attorney general's office, you know, but, you know, it has to come to a head at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6652.976s">You</a>  know, when I support the paper that's before us, you know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6656.139s">You</a>  look at the capital plan, you know, you see these things in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6658.942s">So</a>  it's not something that we haven't planned for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6661.824s">You</a>  look at the funding sources, that's a little different. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6663.566s">You</a>  know, when you look at the funding sources in the capital plan, most of it says that it's going to be general fund debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6668.831s">It's</a>  not going to be something that's borrowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6670.632s">So,</a>  you know, that's where in lies the rub. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6673.635s">But</a>  ultimately, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6676.104s">In</a>  theory, it's a good paper, but in terms of process and procedure, this is something that we need to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6681.605s">And</a>  I think that this is a way that we can do it.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6683.645s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6688.266s">Councilor</a>  Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6689.806s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell, and thank you, Tim, for being here and providing helpful context around this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6695.748s">I</a>  think my feelings are similar to Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6700.288s">I</a>  feel that I would be comfortable going forward with this <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6704.807s">paper</a>  this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6705.908s">I'm</a>  comfortable tabling it if we table it to a date certain, March 14th, our next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6709.851s">I</a>  think this is an issue that we encounter very often as a council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6717.737s">I'm</a>  very sympathetic to our need to take actions that force action because we haven't had a super consistent track record of seamless collaboration. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6733.658s">So</a>  far, that being said, you know, I feel like I also say this often, there are, you know, I think every individual player has to make decisions about what they're willing to hold up and what they're not willing to see held up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6748.067s">And</a>  all of these projects, you know, that come before us are important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6750.528s">I</a>  think it's up to each of us to make our consideration of what we're willing to place on hold in order to try to force another action. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6758.093s">So</a>  I think this is <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6759.409s">a</a>  really important paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6760.309s">I</a>  know that, you know, sidewalk repair and road repair is an accessibility issue that touches everybody in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6764.451s">I'm</a>  comfortable tabling it for one meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6766.472s">Beyond</a>  that, you know, I think this is really important to make sure that it goes forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6770.213s">And</a>  these greater issues of budget and, you know, continuing, I think what we've had are really great first steps recently in greater budget transparency, continuing those. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6780.457s">I</a>  hope that we continue those <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6783.379s">in</a>  parallel, and perhaps if we are amending this paper to ask the mayor for a determination on if KP Law is functioning as an acting city solicitor, if we could also perhaps include an update on where we are at with hiring a city solicitor and assistant city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6805.11s">I</a>  know that that was in the works. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6806.471s">I</a>  haven't had an update in a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6808.492s">I'm</a>  taking it on good faith that that's a real project. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6811.094s">I</a>  believe that it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6812.338s">and</a>  I think that we're all incredibly eager to see whether we actually get the opportunity to know when that in-house legal counsel will arrive.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6819.802s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6821.062s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6821.903s">Any</a>  further discussion for the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6824.584s">Going</a>  to public, I see Matthew Paisley-Berman, hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6830.207s">I'll</a>  unmute you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6830.747s">I'm</a>  sorry, you just need to hit.</p>

    <p>[Page Lieberman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6835.31s">I</a>  got it, I got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6836.43s">So</a>  I've known Tim for, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6838.752s">Is</a>  there a little echo? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6839.673s">Okay,</a>  I've known Tim for years, many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6843.956s">And,</a>  you know, Tim and I, we were speaking in I guess it was around September to November 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6848.88s">And</a>  he was telling me about all the work that he's done with, with Brianna or with our mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6854.284s">and</a>  examining all the sidewalks, like every single inch, doing a real audit of the city, figure out all the work that needs to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6861.509s">So,</a>  I mean, I've been extremely excited. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6863.69s">I</a>  think in our city, we're extremely fortunate to have people like Tim heading up departments. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6868.654s">I</a>  guess, I think that was back when it was the DPW and now engineering, I got it mixed up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6873.157s">I'm</a>  sorry about that, Tim. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6874.358s">But,</a>  you know, I stopped by City Hall yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6876.759s">I</a>  was talking to a lot of people. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6878.42s">It</a>  was a little bit after 4.30. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6879.981s">I</a>  went to stop by Tim's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6882.263s">People</a>  were closing up <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6884.645s">And,</a>  you know, it was after 430. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6886.467s">I</a>  wasn't able to go in because he's still he's still working after the clock was was over. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6891.212s">He's</a>  still he's still at the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6892.834s">And</a>  I really, really hope that he could get the money as soon as he needs as soon as he needs that money to fix up our city, make our city really <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6900.803s">really</a>  nice quality. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6901.484s">I</a>  know that there are people here that are on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6903.586s">They</a>  got the reservations. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6904.907s">It's</a>  nothing against him, but they have assorted reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6907.989s">No</a>  K P law touched me in a certain way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6909.891s">You</a>  know, K P law this capable of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6912.433s">But</a>  I mean, I really appreciate what you know, Councilor Collins says and Councilor Bears that perhaps if it's gonna be held up for just one session. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6919.94s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6920.821s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6921.401s">But</a>  let's let's at least give departments the money they need to work for our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6925.925s">But</a>  there's an orthogonal issue, and that's this whole KP law, KP law that's going on every session. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6932.91s">People</a>  will say, I'm sorry to repeat myself, but I have to repeat myself one more time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6937.013s">And</a>  so I start wondering, why is it the council has so much difficulty thinking outside of the box about how to get an answer? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6945.159s">Because</a>  in my experience in this city, when people want to do things, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6948.061s">They</a>  get the answer immediately, even when it's a mayor that's not responsive. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6951.984s">All</a>  it takes is some mobilizing and some people that are leaders that know how to do the mobilizing, and they say, let's get an answer from the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6959.269s">I</a>  really think it may be time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6962.213s">for</a>  the council to start thinking outside of the box, how will we get an answer? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6967.735s">Because</a>  if anybody needs my help, just tell me, just tell me, I can call the mayor, what is the answer about KP law and be done with this silly, you know, Benghazi KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6978.057s">And</a>  I'm always wondering where did KP law touch you? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6980.498s">You</a>  know, so just let, let me know if we need to get an answer because there's going on and on and on and on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6985.619s">It's</a>  holding up the city.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6987.7s">Oh,</a>  madam president.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6994.605s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6995.446s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6996.527s">So</a>  I appreciate Mr. Lieberman. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=6998.448s">He's</a>  been very active and involved in our community, and he makes a lot of sense at times. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7004.153s">But</a>  I think when we're talking about money papers, I think for one, Councilor, KP law is an issue because we've made mistakes because we don't have legal representation supporting this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7015.862s">So</a>  we've been left out in the cold on some serious legal issues that cost us a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7022.127s">That's</a>  one. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7024.301s">My</a>  respect for Tim and what they're doing, it can't be, it's not questioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7033.004s">He</a>  is amazing, what they're doing there is amazing, but the problem we're having is understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7039.126s">I</a>  know we had our financial paperwork here the other day, financial director here, and he presented some sort of paperwork. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7046.089s">We</a>  still don't see where we are financially in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7051.531s">So</a>  bonding and keep spending money, not understanding where we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7055.674s">It</a>  sounds great today and I think it's out of the box and let's do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7058.536s">Let's</a>  do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7059.336s">And</a>  we do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7060.397s">And</a>  then we come to me and say, guess what? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7064.229s">We</a>  didn't know the financial outlook, but this is what it is today now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7068.311s">We</a>  now have to go to Tim and say, Tim, you have that great equipment we just purchased, but now they're gonna turn into planters, because now we have to lay off 10 DPW employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7078.077s">This</a>  is my fear of where we were last year, last May and June. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7083.2s">Don't</a>  forget where we were, that at one in the morning, the mayor had to come back from home and try to figure out a way to give us, find us $12 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7092.947s">So</a>  that's all I'm saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7095.208s">We</a>  know the issues we have in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7097.829s">We</a>  see it every day and we appreciate directors like Tim that are working their tail off and trying to do the best they can. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7105.132s">But</a>  for one council that represents everybody in the city of Medford financially, if we don't see the paperwork in front of us, we don't see the numbers in front of us, no matter what was presented last week, because that's a great start, but it's March. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7122.236s">It's</a>  March. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7124.897s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7127.458s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7128.318s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7130.339s">William</a>  Navarre, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7135.8s">I</a>  sort of have a question about the procedure here and all that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7140.002s">If</a>  city council is unhappy with the notion that under rule 30, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7150.851s">KP</a>  law is they don't want they don't want to acknowledge the fiction that KP law is the city solicitor acting city solicitor, and they want you know a natural person to be to be that city solicitor rule 30 is Council's own rule Council vote to rule this out of order for rule 30, and rather than wait for attorney general, there's rule 30 and then there's a separate ordinance around.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7171.48s">establishing</a>  the position.</p>

    <p>[Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7172.981s">That's</a>  a good point.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7175.021s">So</a>  we can strike down rule 30 and that would solve maybe this paper, but it wouldn't, there's another ordinance that I think is worth some of the questions.</p>

    <p>[Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7183.665s">Fair</a>  enough, but you can do both too, right?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7186.666s">I</a>  mean, in theory.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7190.307s">I</a>  think we should amend the charter so the council appoints a city solicitor, but that's just my thoughts.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7194.649s">I</a>  mean, let's see what happens first.</p>

    <p>[Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7203.463s">I</a>  just say, rather than wait to deal with this paper till you get back from the Attorney General, you could just say, City Council doesn't like this arrangement, we're not doing this, you know, let's get it sorted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7220.731s">Right,</a>  okay, well that's fair enough to point of information, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7227.405s">We</a>  did say that during the budget hearings that we didn't like the setup. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7230.408s">And</a>  that's why we agreed to pass a budget when the mayor said that she was going to provide us with an assistant city solicitor that works in the building for the city council.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7240.676s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7241.256s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7242.958s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President, just because I think we have kind of three prongs of things here now on the table and we should move forward as best we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7254.984s">One</a>  is Councilor Knight saying that he wants the Attorney General's office to review whether this is acceptable relative to our city ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7264.371s">The</a>  second is something that I brought up, which is if the mayor could state whether or not in her view, KP Law is functioning as the acting city solicitor for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7274.659s">And</a>  the third thing Councilor Collins brought up is an update on the hiring process for the city solicitor, the assistant city solicitor.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7283.777s">Thank</a>  you for presenting back promotions.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7285.639s">I</a>  just want to, is that right?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7287.42s">That</a>  is what I have.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7288.14s">That's</a>  what I was going to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7294.264s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7295.825s">I'm</a>  just, I'm trying to not, not trying to fill in for you at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7301.008s">Madam</a>  president, just, I was just looking up very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7306.912s">There's</a>  a municipal law bureau at the attorney general's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7311.468s">relative</a>  to those ideas, if everyone who proposed those three different ideas would be comfortable, can we move to table this for one meeting till March 14th, request that the city clerk call the Municipal Law Bureau at the Attorney General's office tomorrow or this week and request that review that Councilor Knight asked for, or ask what the process would be for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7335.351s">and</a>  then also ask that the administration get back to us in 10 days around my question and Councilor Collins' question. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7341.412s">And</a>  then in two weeks, we will have some sort of response back from the Attorney General. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7347.074s">It</a>  may not be a full response. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7349.094s">It</a>  may say, this is the process you need to go through to get us to do this, or we don't do this, or whatever else it may be. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7354.655s">But</a>  I just wanted to put some timelines and a shock box on the whole thing, because I agree we need the right answer, but I also agree that we should try to move as fast as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7364.455s">Does</a>  that make sense to everybody, the three folks who proposed motions?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7367.696s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, I think Councilor Knight has the original motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7369.716s">I</a>  don't think there's debate about the other motions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7371.356s">I</a>  think Councilor Knight, the proposed changes from Vice President Bears around the original motion, is that something you'd be amenable to?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7378.478s">Yeah,</a>  it's not a big deal.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7380.178s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7381.138s">I</a>  don't think there's any debate around the other motions, so.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7384.739s">Motion,</a>  keep them all together, we can vote them as one package.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7387.339s">Okay,</a>  so we have a motion from Councilor Knight to combine those three motions.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7393.425s">approval</a>  as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7395.106s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7396.047s">Okay,</a>  so we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7398.508s">We</a>  have a motion from Council tonight to combine all three motions as amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7402.971s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7403.472s">Everyone</a>  understands three motions are before us we have the table to a date certain have the clerk, reach out to the AP. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7410.276s">We</a>  have Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7415.639s">We're</a>  not approving the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7416.78s">We're</a>  tabling and then we have a number of <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7421.997s">motions.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7425.44s">Councilor</a>  Collins is asking for their opinion on whether or not keeping the laws acting as a state solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7434.929s">That's</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7436.07s">Hiring</a>  update. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7437.151s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7447.287s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7454.137s">And</a>  this is the table and those other actions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7456.22s">Table</a>  to a date, sir, and the other actions.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7462.709s">Madam</a>  President, we're into suspension.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7465.742s">We</a>  have to vote but go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7468.204s">We</a>  also have paper 23057 which is really similar subject matter, and that circumstance we had an opinion from the acting city solicitor at the time was in house in our city solicitor will give us an opinion relative to the way that these promotional advancements and salary increases should be implemented. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7485.034s">We</a>  then received an opinion from KP law and then a revised opinion from KP law. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7488.776s">again,</a>  KP Lawyers stated that they're not the city's attorney, they're the mayor's private attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7492.479s">They've</a>  given us two contrary legal opinions to the standing and acting legal city solicitor at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7497.343s">So,</a>  you know, we're kind of in the same circumstance with this paper that we were in the others.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7501.446s">Okay,</a>  we're gonna go on this paper first. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7507.39s">Please</a>  call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7509.752s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7512.033s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7513.715s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7516.277s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7525.177s">unless</a>  the conflict of interest is what their rules say. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7529.8s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7533.982s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7535.563s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7535.803s">7</a>  in front of zero negative motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7537.564s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7538.284s">Motion</a>  to table passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7542.287s">23-057</a>  to Honorable President Morell and members of the Medford City Council regarding request to establish the traffic and transportation director position in the city's classification compensation plan resubmitted <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7552.298s">Dear</a>  President Morell and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that the City Council approve the following amendment to the revised ordinances, chapter 66, entitled personnel, article two, entitled reserve, the city's classification and compensation plan, formally included as article two, sections 66-31 through 66-40, by adopting the following language change. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7572.416s">The</a>  language of PW 2022 shall be amended to include the following position, traffic and transportation director, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7578.504s">traffic</a>  and transportation director position is filled by a current staff member who took on a new role with additional responsibilities and was included in the FY 22 and 23 budgets but the title has not been added to the city's classification and compensation plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7590.193s">Based</a>  on the October 20, 2022 KP law memo, personal ordinance amendments dash quantum of vote requirement end quote, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7597.574s">It</a>  is our revised opinion that this classification requires four votes under general laws, chapter 44, section 33A, along with a supplemental appropriation for which we have submitted an associated paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7607.919s">Chief</a>  of staff, Ian Nazarian, is available to speak to this request and answer any questions you may have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7612.301s">Thank</a>  you for your kind attention to this matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7613.721s">Respectfully</a>  submitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7614.462s">We're</a>  gonna allow the current mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7617.563s">Councilor</a>  Knight, would you like to continue? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7618.623s">Do</a>  you have anything else you'd like to add?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7619.924s">No,</a>  as previously stated, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7622.245s">I</a>  think the gentleman's doing great work, though. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7623.606s">Don't</a>  get me wrong.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7627.188s">thinks</a>  the gentleman is doing great work don't get him wrong.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7631.839s">Any</a>  members of the Council wish to speak, I'm happy to hear from them first.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7638.789s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7639.89s">I</a>  just I'm here to say that this is the letters, I think, say exactly what we're here for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7645.115s">But</a>  I will say that this was part of the strategy strategy multiple years ago to have a director of traffic and transportation position in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7655.905s">I</a>  think we all agree that it's been a very valuable thing for the city to have traffic and transportation engineers on staff at the engineering office. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7664.052s">I</a>  believe that the value that they have added to the city is tremendous. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7669.456s">So</a>  the step to make it, to make that a director level position, I think is a critical step for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7678.062s">And</a>  so we can continue to provide that service that I believe the city needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7682.845s">So</a>  hopefully this finds its way to passage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7686.567s">So</a>  thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7687.748s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7689.449s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7690.31s">Again,</a>  Madam President, again, I don't, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7693.112s">Um,</a>  it's not that I don't support, uh, traffic, uh, engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7701.238s">I</a>  think that he does an amazing job. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7703.18s">But</a>  again, I think that there's too many questions still haven't been asked or answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7708.544s">Uh,</a>  when we've sent that out, I reiterate what Councilor Knight said. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7713.828s">Our</a>  city solicitor said that there were some concerns with the process and agreed with this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7722.441s">And</a>  then, again, we get contradictory feedback from KP Law, so I'm left in limbo. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7729.543s">I</a>  don't think that we can move forward with any of these caps or increases or change of salaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7737.465s">Although,</a>  do I think it deserves it? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7739.186s">Absolutely,</a>  but it's also, what we're seeing is you have other departments that people are picking up duties <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7751.502s">and</a>  not being compensated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7753.103s">And</a>  I'll give you an example of the veteran director who was put into position back in the day when he was the hearing officer and he was waiting to be compensated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7765.812s">And</a>  don't forget that day because people that were here remember the injustice there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7771.396s">So</a>  here we are now in the same situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7774.058s">So</a>  this isn't how business works in the municipality. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7778.921s">Although</a>  as much as I like <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7781.087s">the</a>  director. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7781.667s">I</a>  don't you can't be picking and choosing. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7784.228s">I</a>  think it's a slippery slope. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7785.989s">And</a>  again, this is why, you know, not having having a conflicting legal, um, representation is a huge problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7796.694s">So</a>  I won't be able to support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7799.275s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7800.775s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7801.776s">I</a>  respect my colleagues positions on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7803.917s">I</a>  think <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7805.452s">There's</a>  been a number of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7806.653s">I</a>  think that maybe the chain of events and the opinions are getting a little bit conflated, but I, again, I respect my fellow councilors positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7818.083s">To</a>  me, the way that this is presented tonight, it's very clear that a new position in the city does not exist until it is approved in the cap. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7826.289s">This</a>  is presented as a new position to be added to the cap, which did not exist prior to any action that we take on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7835.1s">We</a>  did receive legal advice from KP Law, a memorandum from KP Law around these issues, clearly delineating the requirements of Chapter 44, Section 33A. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7849.5s">And</a>  when it comes to creating a new position, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7852.929s">that</a>  requires four votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7855.45s">If</a>  it's something else, there's other requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7859.212s">But</a>  this is, I think, to me, very similar to the senior planner position that was created by this council and amended to the CAF in late last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7867.575s">And</a>  I also think, and I'm just gonna say what I said at that meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7876.704s">The</a>  work that we do here is a balancing of interests and a balancing of what's best for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7880.991s">I</a>  personally feel confident on this paper and the legal justification behind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7887.561s">And</a>  I also feel that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7890.649s">this</a>  person that the creation of a traffic and transportation director, and making sure that a person who fills that role has the multiple years of experience with the city that the person who would, you know, likely be taking the role has is essential, and we know that there are <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7911.002s">not</a>  enough experts to fill too many open jobs. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7914.625s">There</a>  are other communities, there are state agencies that are looking for people with the expertise of this position and that's why I personally am going to support this tonight because I want to make sure that this city <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7933.834s">that</a>  we as a city council are making sure that the city has the staff and tools that the city needs to be successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7940.782s">And</a>  that's my reasoning. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7944.086s">So</a>  thank you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7945.708s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins and Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7948.852s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7956.704s">I</a>  appreciate my federal Councilors sharing their thoughts about this, and I appreciate that it is kind of in conversation with the previous paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7964.449s">I</a>  will be supporting this tonight, and like I said on the previous paper about the loan order, I would have been comfortable going forward with that paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7977.417s">I</a>  think we heard from the expert in the room that it's not gonna be catastrophic to wait on that for two weeks, so I was comfortable with that middle ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7985.792s">And</a>  I also said, I think every council has to make their own decision about, you know, what tactics to use and where we feel comfortable drawing a line in the sand. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=7995.536s">And</a>  as Mr. Bears put it, weighing those balances. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8001.398s">As</a>  every project that comes before us is important to the functioning of the city in some way. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8007.661s">My</a>  understanding, this is the first reading anyway, and we know that we're getting that legal opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8014.071s">And</a>  this, the creation of this position I think is very overdue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8017.134s">It's</a>  very important to the city it's important to me, the D the, you know, acting traffic and transportation director person currently in that role once it's codified I think is one of the experts in the city that I've turned to the most of the city councilor on the incredibly responsive it helped me out was scores of <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8036.377s">constituent</a>  problems and complaints and questions over the past 14 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8041.659s">And</a>  I just think that the creation of this position is critical to where we are as a city today in the 21st century with just the sheer amount of traffic and transportation related projects and problems that come across my email inbox. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8057.824s">This</a>  is a motion that I'm personally not willing to wait for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8062.705s">So</a>  I'll be voicing my support tonight, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8066.53s">Thanks,</a>  my fellow Councilors for listening to my explanation.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8069.652s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8071.473s">Thank</a>  you, President Burrell. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8073.153s">I</a>  hear my fellow colleagues and their different viewpoints on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8078.576s">I,</a>  however, do plan to vote yes on this because, as for the same reasons, Councilor Bears has elaborated. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8088.434s">I</a>  believe the legal reasoning is pretty sound here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8090.396s">It's</a>  pretty clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8091.197s">We've</a>  been through this before. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8093.62s">We've</a>  talked about this exact procedure before, and it is a new position. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8100.007s">When</a>  I approach a vote like this, I also think about what the practical everyday effects are. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8107.275s">And</a>  I do fear, as, as we, you know, we're always talking about the difficulty of hiring city staff and the difficulty of retaining city staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8119.909s">that</a>  we would lose staff to different communities that are willing to pay more to the state agencies who are willing to pay more. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8127.055s">And</a>  I think this role is so vital to the everyday functioning of our city and as Councilor Collins referred to the constituents requests for their city government to serve them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8145.31s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8146.591s">I</a>  just, I just believe that we would be severely harmed if we don't move forward with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8152.677s">Um,</a>  yeah.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8155.32s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8158.944s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8159.884s">I</a>  just just to be clear, I appreciate these comments and I think that that's what's great about this forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8166.211s">But</a>  again, this is <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8169.542s">as</a>  23-057 then leads off to 23-058 and that's gonna talk about the differential in the salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8180.595s">I</a>  want us all to look at that and realize that <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8184.076s">does,</a>  because it seems to me that we're going to be losing a union position and all of us here are union supporters, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8191.58s">This</a>  compensation for what reads in the next resolution, the increase of the funding using salaries would be funded because of a highway salaries account due to temporary vacancies in the senior clerk position. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8205.409s">So</a>  does that mean that we're losing the senior clerk position to fund this position? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8210.792s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8211.974s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8213.095s">So</a>  what does that mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8214.357s">Just</a>  for clarification purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8216.92s">So</a>  when this person does come back, Tim, we're gonna hire this person back full salary? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8221.025s">And</a>  then how are we gonna pay this position if that money's being used somewhere else?</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8226.069s">I</a>  don't have an answer to that question, but I know that I haven't agreed to any losing any position. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8230.691s">So</a>  my full understanding is that we wouldn't be losing any position.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8234.092s">Chief</a>  of staff Nazarian here, just because that's something that's important before I vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8238.934s">If</a>  you look for both papers together, this is approving something that is still questionable because of not understanding the true legal separation of two different parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8248.178s">But</a>  then the next page talks about the funding of that position. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8252.08s">And</a>  that's looks like eliminating a union position. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8255.672s">So</a>  is Chief of Staff here?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8257.474s">Madam</a>  Chief of Staff's not on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8258.775s">Oh,</a>  that's good. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8259.215s">I</a>  don't know why she's not on the call.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8260.316s">She</a>  did say she was, though, right?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8261.437s">Yeah,</a>  I don't know why she's not on the call.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8264.699s">I</a>  can speak to it a little bit, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8267.181s">Just</a>  that not having the senior clerk accrued some value in that particular line to cover the increase for this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8276.028s">So</a>  I believe it would need to be presented to you in a budget for following years after the creation of the CAF.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8281.813s">Is</a>  there someone in that position now, or does it remain vacant?</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8285.517s">I</a>  believe we have all of our clerk positions filled in DPW right now.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8289.621s">Okay,</a>  so it was a past vacancy that's been filled?</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8292.043s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8292.704s">So</a>  all of our clerk positions are filled at the moment.</p>

    <p>[Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8296.508s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8297.909s">If</a>  I can, just... <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8299.906s">This</a>  is the increase the funding using the salaries of funded curve, the DPW salaries account due to a temporary vacancy and the senior clerk's position. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8308.17s">That</a>  person is now, they hired the person now? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8311.312s">There</a>  was a vacancies back? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8312.953s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8313.713s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8314.874s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8316.855s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8317.976s">I'd</a>  move to approve this paper for first reading.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8321.337s">I</a>  do see Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8324.279s">I</a>  don't know if he's coming back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8325.2s">I</a>  can see him out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8326.06s">He</a>  wants to vote on that.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8329.807s">Yeah,</a>  and the other thing I would just say is I do believe the traffic and transportation director and the position was included in the new unit of management positions that was organized by level 25. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8339.369s">So</a>  I don't believe there'll be a loss of the union position.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8342.35s">Just</a>  clarify that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8345.35s">I</a>  don't want to lose that clerical position.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8347.431s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello, we have a motion to approve paper 23-057, adding the new <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8360.131s">traffic</a>  and transportation director position to that path for first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8365.174s">So</a>  on the motion of vices and affairs is seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8368.036s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8369.317s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8375.981s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8376.181s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8376.321s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8389.773s">Councilor</a>  Seheult. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8390.333s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8391.414s">Councilor</a>  Morocco. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8392.174s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8392.675s">Four</a>  in the affirmative, three in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8394.396s">The</a>  motion passes for first reading. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8397.518s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8398.799s">And</a>  then 23-058, to Honorable President Morell and members of the Medford City Council regarding appropriation requests for traffic and transportation director salary differential resubmitted. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8408.525s">Dear</a>  President Morell and members of the City Council, I respectfully request to transfer $4,175 in available funding from DPW highway salaries accounts <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8417.756s">010-421-5110</a>  to DPW engineering salaries account 010-411-5110 and to appropriate set funding to pay for the salary differential associated with establishing the traffic and transportation director as a PW22 and the city's classification and compensation plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8434.671s">The</a>  transfer funds the salary differential for a total of 24.6 weeks in FY23, assuming the new classification goes into effect on February 28th, 2023. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8442.998s">This</a>  increase will be <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8446.018s">will</a>  be funding using the salary funding that accrued in the DPW highway salaries account due to temporary vacancy of the senior clerk position. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8453.942s">Chief</a>  of staffing in this area is available to speak to this request, as well as the associated classification request and answer any questions you may have. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=8459.765s">We</a>  need for your attention to the matter, respectfully submitted, grant along with current mayor.</p>

    <p>[McGivern]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9137.878s">I</a>  guess an enforcement order, I believe it's what it's called, was issued by the Conservation Commission to one person for just that clearing brush that's protected under the Wellands Protection Act. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9150.21s">It's</a>  near a river. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9151.932s">I</a>  believe the activity has come to an end. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9154.294s">I'm</a>  not 100% sure on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9156.586s">We</a>  also had some volunteer groups, I believe, do some proper maintenance that was approved by DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9164.053s">So</a>  I just want to be clear that that activity was happening as well, but that was legitimate activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9169.878s">And</a>  then we had this activity by one individual, from what I understand, who was taking it upon himself to take care of our waterfront. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9179.583s">So</a>  that's my understanding of the whole situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9181.644s">But</a>  again, I was just briefed on these issues, so I don't have a full detailed understanding.</p>

    <p>[Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9197.412s">Madam</a>  President, yes, actually, Commissioner McGivern got that completely correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9202.135s">This</a>  was an activity that was occurring last spring and over the summer, and we had a hard time finding it happening to stop it, but a member of the Riverbend Garden did contact our office, let us know when it was actually happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9219.104s">Our</a>  environmental agent, Dennis McDougal, went down there, spoke with the individual who was <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9227.409s">argumentative.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9229.231s">The</a>  Conservation Commission issued an enforcement order that he should stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9237.34s">We</a>  appreciate the help of our police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9240.483s">Enforcement</a>  orders have to be <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9243.8s">You</a>  have to sign that you've received it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9246.201s">There</a>  needs to be legal proof. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9248.421s">And</a>  so when somebody's issued something like this, they don't always want to sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9253.103s">So</a>  the police officer was able to verify for us that it was, in fact, delivered by an officer by hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9263.686s">We've</a>  kept an eye on the area, and there's been no further cutting in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9271.809s">By</a>  that individual as the commissioner explained, we did have some organized invasives removing and Vista pruning that occurred. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9282.938s">in</a>  the area adjacent to that that was done correctly under the supervision of our tree warden. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9289.8s">We</a>  encourage any residents who think that we're not clearing our vistas well enough and removing invasives to come and speak with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9297.683s">The</a>  Mystic River Watershed Association does organize volunteer vista pruning events. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9304.445s">We've</a>  been keeping an eye on the area to determine whether <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9308.346s">uh,</a>  planting makes sense this spring or whether it'll, um, just fill in appropriately as needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9317.089s">Um,</a>  but yeah, limbs of trees were cut and large and trees that should not have been cut were cut as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9323.952s">Um,</a>  and, uh, DPW and DCR were very helpful in removing the large piles of brush that appeared. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9330.194s">Uh,</a>  I think, um, I think that covers everything you asked about?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9334.136s">I</a>  believe so. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9336.537s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9338.629s">Thank</a>  you, Director. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9339.61s">Any</a>  further discussion on the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9343.011s">Thank</a>  you for bringing this forward.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9344.552s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Madam President, Madam President, I'm gonna throw the motion on the questions been asked and answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9349.215s">You</a>  know, it seems like everything that we were going to request they've already done.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9353.997s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9355.098s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9358.335s">23-048</a>  offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council requests the city administration take the necessary steps to require that DCR and DOT perform roadway maintenance repairs on all on-ramps and off-ramps under their respective jurisdictions, and be it further resolved that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to our state delegation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9376.382s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9377.635s">Madam</a>  President's rather self explanatory, as you'll know, on ramps and off ramps to 9316 and the like are in some rough shape, and I'm hoping that the dot can come out and give it a little bit of 10 to 11 care to prevent any damage to the resident of cities vehicles.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9394.611s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9394.892s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9395.332s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9397.634s">So,</a>  on the motion of Council night seconded by Councilor Carlyle Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9409.897s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9411.618s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9413.659s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9416.601s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9416.862s">Yes,</a>  seven affirmative zero negative emotion passes to three to 049 offered by Councilor Collins, the result the Metro City Council publicize that increase snap payments known as snap emergency allotments will expire on March 2 <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9428.857s">and</a>  benefits will decrease for all recipients. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9430.978s">More</a>  information and resources are available at mass.gov slash extra COVID snap. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9435.459s">Recipients</a>  may qualify for new increases to snap benefits based on medical costs or rent expenses and can contact the Department of Transitional Assistance for information about their account. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9444.562s">For</a>  the result of the administration share this information via the city's communication channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9449.664s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9451.431s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9452.611s">So</a>  I wanted to use the council as a forum to make sure that as many Medford residents as possible heard about this upcoming change. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9459.954s">Our</a>  nation's leaders have allowed for extra pandemic assistance to expire. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9464.135s">So</a>  on March 3rd, every household that's currently using SNAP can expect to start receiving at least 95 fewer dollars a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9471.918s">This</a>  is potentially very damaging to households, especially as cost of living and cost of food remains high. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9477.245s">and</a>  local governments have been asked to help get the word out so people can prepare as best they can to fill the gap. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9484.027s">Residents</a>  are encouraged to contact the Department of Transitional Assistance for more information about how they will specifically be affected to see if they can qualify for those new increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9493.63s">And</a>  I did hear from the City's Director of Communications today that the City of Medford is planning to broadcast <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9498.832s">this</a>  information and those links to resources on the city website and social media channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9502.695s">So</a>  to residents who are looking for those details about how to investigate this further and look into resources that they and their households can potentially use, I would counsel them to be on the lookout for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9514.885s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9517.908s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9518.668s">And</a>  I did see a Facebook. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9519.829s">I</a>  mean, I know there's many other communication channels. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9521.41s">I</a>  did see a Facebook post from the city about this either today or yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9526.495s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9529.022s">Second</a>  Councilor Tseng, I do three. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9530.983s">Matthew</a>  Page-Lieberman with their hand up.</p>

    <p>[Page Lieberman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9535.105s">Yeah,</a>  I'm on SNAP and I am aware of this upcoming, it's a return to the levels from before the pandemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9543.669s">So</a>  I'm really, really happy that Councilor Collins is talking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9547.611s">Also,</a>  I have, I'm just a single person and I've rarely got to the grocery store. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9553.574s">So</a>  during this pandemic, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9555.233s">I've</a>  actually accumulated a lot of snap credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9558.418s">And</a>  if there's anybody in the audience that could ever, you know, quite a lot of money in my snap account, if there's anybody in the audience who could ever use help with groceries, let me know and I'll buy them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9570.736s">from</a>  this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9571.336s">It's</a>  totally legal. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9572.317s">You</a>  can totally do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9573.917s">I'm</a>  not going to get my information out online. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9576.138s">But</a>  if anybody, if you if you're watching at home, if you could contact maybe Councilor Collins, I don't know what your K with you or one of the other Councilors just, you know, pastor information. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9584.562s">And,</a>  you know, I could, you know, we could go to the grocery store. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9588.363s">Just</a>  let me know, because there are people that are also hungry and I have the resources that I need. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9593.285s">So</a>  if anybody needs groceries, please tell somebody and we could see what we can do.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9597.627s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9599.864s">Love</a>  to see mutual aid infiltrate the council chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9602.625s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9654.771s">Councilor</a>  Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9656.192s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9657.792s">This</a>  council has talked about similar legislation in previous sessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9662.694s">The</a>  current pilot program statewide still exempts wealthy nonprofits like universities from paying taxes, property taxes, and that short changes cities like ours from much needed, fairly deserved tax revenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9676.398s">These</a>  are not the shoestring kind of nonprofits that probably the word comes to mind with these. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9684.198s">high</a>  wealth nonprofits that are property tax exempt, their revenue is increasing, their endowments are often quite large, and it's not logical for them to be exempt from paying taxes to their host communities, something that every other resident and type of business is required to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9699.505s">So</a>  this proposed legislation would be to change the existing law to make large nonprofits <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9705.717s">no</a>  longer able to pay taxes or compensation on a purely voluntary basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9709.839s">And</a>  so I asked my colleagues for their support for this bill, which would make larger organizations, sorry, large organizations start paying their fair share. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9717.582s">And</a>  I think we can all imagine the very material ways that recouping some of that lost revenue from large nonprofits like Tufts University and my Alma mater, how big of a difference that would make in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9728.646s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9729.847s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9730.667s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9731.647s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9732.668s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins for sponsoring this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9736.156s">I</a>  believe, I can't remember which one of us did it last time, but it was me. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9743.283s">You</a>  know, I think you made really great points. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9745.686s">Something</a>  that we did two years ago is we were able to look at assessor data at the City of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9750.59s">And</a>  if Tufts, just Tufts for example, was taxed at the same rate as <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9755.945s">was</a>  taxed at all for property taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9757.246s">They</a>  would pay $8 million a year in property taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9761.327s">Now,</a>  this law would only require up to 25% of what they would nominally pay, so it would be about $2 million a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9770.751s">But</a>  I just want to say since we've had the discussions here tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9773.634s">That's</a>  $2 million for sidewalk crew to support our firefighters to support all the emergency calls that go out to tops to support street and sidewalk infrastructure repairs in their area to support affordable housing in the area around the top neighborhood, and I'm just putting that out there to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9791.437s">I</a>  can understand why a nonprofit education or healthcare institution maybe shouldn't be treated the same as a for profit business, but I don't think the answer is that they should be treated, it should be 100% for one and 0% for the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9806.42s">And</a>  I also want to put out there to this isn't just about tops. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9809.403s">This</a>  is about all of the large nonprofit institutions, and whether or not they play pay pilot payments to the city tops for example while this legislation would allow basically up to $2 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9821.076s">If</a>  they paid normal private tax to be $8 million tops right now pays $450,000 to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9826.321s">But</a>  other pilot agreements such as right across the street from this building, Harvard Vanguard used to pay a trace health whatever it is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9835.432s">They</a>  used to pay a pilot agreement and they pulled out of their power agreement unilaterally without any city engagement they no longer provide any. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9843.342s">pilot</a>  payment to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9845.003s">Something</a>  I'm exploring actually is that Atrius Health was just bought up and is now a for-profit institution, so maybe they'll have to start paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9851.809s">But</a>  my point is to say that right now, the way that the current state law reads, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9857.116s">it's</a>  up to the discretion of the institution. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9859.919s">And</a>  that means that even if you have an agreement, the institution could pull out at any time and leave the city holding the bag. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9866.505s">And</a>  we're already holding the bag for all the services and needs in the areas around these large institutions that they're not paying their fair share for. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9875.374s">So</a>  I really hope <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9878.049s">that</a>  the State House can do something to create a fair system where we're still understanding that these are nonprofit health and education institutions that should have some benefit, but that benefit shouldn't be all or nothing the way it is now. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9891.996s">And</a>  furthermore, just to drive home the point, this is for large property owners, the threshold, your property has to be worth, I believe, over $15 million to even be qualified under this suggested amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9903.422s">So</a>  thank you, Councilor Collins, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9905.823s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9906.703s">Any</a>  further discussion from the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9909.713s">Going</a>  back to Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9913.197s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9914.378s">I</a>  think it's just important to point out that these large scale nonprofits like healthcare institutions and universities also provide a great community benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9923.132s">namely</a>  jobs that provide a living wage. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9926.254s">So</a>  we have to also take into consideration the economic benefits that they bring to a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9930.635s">You</a>  see communities that have universities located inside them and the benefits that they have economically when the recession hits. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9937.858s">So</a>  I think it's also important to point out the benefits that come along with having large-scale universities and large-scale healthcare institutions in the community that are non-profit as well.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9948.51s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9949.871s">Going</a>  to Matthew Page-Lieberman.</p>

    <p>[Page Lieberman]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9957.874s">It's</a>  very, very good that this, you know, this topic about we're essentially talking about pilot that's coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9963.436s">You</a>  know, this has unfortunately been a situation we've been in for quite a few years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9966.577s">I</a>  know there's a local community organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9969.058s">They</a>  wanted me to assist with a pilot initiative they're working on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9973.059s">And</a>  there was a lot of <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9974.744s">things</a>  that kind of happened that it seemed like perhaps that group or whatever wasn't really ready to engage with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9981.77s">But</a>  I did, I remember this, I don't know, like this back during the last mayor's administration, I like kind of looked into stuff and talked to the person who's like the person negotiating at the top level. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9993.761s">And</a>  I was following this stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9995.142s">I</a>  believe that Mayor Burke was able to <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=9999.546s">kind</a>  of get some kind of agreement because, you know, our contract with, I'm just talking about Tufts, it just ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10004.77s">And</a>  so my understanding is like, yeah, this was like five years ago or something like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10011.915s">And</a>  so Tufts had decided to just end <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10015.578s">I</a>  increased the amount of money that they're giving to each community where they have property. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10021.461s">Nothing</a>  that any particular community was able to negotiate, no matter how much property they own, no matter how much students or whatever, they just increased that much money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10029.526s">But</a>  there was something that was left off the table, which is the kind of services that particularly Tufts offers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10034.629s">I</a>  know that a lot of times the city likes to have a relationship with interns and stuff like this, what kind of services, like <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10039.972s">I'm</a>  in class right now at Tufts, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10042.113s">Because</a>  I'm a Medford student. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10043.053s">I'm</a>  not paying. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10043.833s">They</a>  allow that kind of stuff. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10046.174s">People</a>  are in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10048.075s">But</a>  this has unfortunately been a conversation that's been going on for a really long time is that we haven't been able to figure out this agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10055.017s">And</a>  a lot of folks have just been focusing on, well, perhaps we can get some more money out of them. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10058.938s">But</a>  universities provide millions, many, many, many, many resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10063.699s">My</a>  understanding is from speaking to somebody recently is that one of the reasons that our mayor <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10069.501s">even</a>  though she did have an editorial in Medford Transcript about three years ago when she was running for office. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10078.089s">It</a>  was a list of all these services that TEPs can provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10081.272s">But</a>  once the pandemic started hitting, everything had to be moved back. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10085.956s">This</a>  is about, I guess, three years ago, there was going to be a particular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10090.06s">for</a>  us in City Hall to start having the Tufts discussion, the POD discussion, but it didn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10096.343s">And</a>  so, you know, recently I've reached out to the mayor again, let's start having that conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10102.066s">And</a>  yeah, I mean, like Councilor Knight was talking about the services. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10105.808s">One</a>  of my understandings is because of the services that Tufts has been providing during this pandemic, we have been kind of, at City Hall, we've been kind of holding off a little bit and pressuring them to this agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10117.833s">I</a>  do completely support any kind of motion to make sure that these universities, these, you know, universities not paying property taxes that have massive amounts of endowments of money that they're sitting on, even when they are paying living wages, they're still sitting on a lot of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10135.123s">They</a>  own buildings, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10136.643s">Many</a>  of these buildings are not providing housing for the people outside of the university community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10141.225s">There's</a>  a lot of stuff we can kind of consider here and can we kind of negotiate, you know, these financial resources that we do need, especially when we have Councilors that are worried that we're going to go like in the red. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10153.715s">You</a>  know, they have the, but beyond that, I'm gonna cut it short. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10157.276s">There</a>  are massive amount of services that the universities can be providing as well that a lot of times we do not consider as far as the intellectual services they can provide for creating really new projects, new projects in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10170.621s">And</a>  I will not go into it, but really new, new projects. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10173.002s">And</a>  I would invite anybody for us all to have the kind of conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10176.963s">And</a>  we should be having conversations with Tufts. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10179.924s">about</a>  those kinds of new projects and collaboration that we can be involved in, rather than saying, will you do this for us and will you do that for us? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10187.47s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Cameron]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10187.83s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Navarre]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10191.933s">I'll</a>  be very brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10193.414s">William</a>  Navarre, 108 Bedford Street, apartment 1B, is basically very similar to what I said last time this came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10198.899s">One</a>  of the big concerns about Tufts, they're buying up a lot of land specifically. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10203.102s">They're</a>  potentially crowding out others. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10205.804s">Taxing</a>  the land they own as heavily as possible would help discourage that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10209.867s">Obviously,</a>  to balance that out, we'd want to tax their improvements as lightly as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10214.731s">We</a>  don't want to discourage them investing in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10217.933s">I</a>  hope that that's a structure that we could consider at some point. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10220.936s">I</a>  hope council, when it finds the opportunity, can support a scheme like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10225.759s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10227.02s">Point</a>  of information, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10230.303s">I</a>  do believe the city and Tufts University have an agreement where all new purchases of parcels outside the campus, the existing campus, would be put on the tax rolls.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10240.767s">Thank</a>  you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10242.789s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Vice President Bears, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10253.038s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10255.159s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10261.945s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10263.827s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10264.287s">Six</a>  in the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10268.299s">23-051</a>  offered by Councilor Collins and President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10270.38s">Be</a>  it resolved that the City Council request an update from the administration on the status of Medford's allocation from the Commonwealth's opioid litigation settlement proceeds in light of the five additional proposed national settlements. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10281.184s">Be</a>  it further resolved that the administration confirm whether the required state subdivision agreement has been submitted to the Attorney General to render Medford eligible to receive an increased allocation from the municipal settlement proceeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10293.728s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10296.547s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell, and thank you for co-sponsoring this. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10299.708s">This</a>  is pertaining to the National Opioid Settlements against the manufacturers and distributors of opioid painkillers. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10306.251s">Late</a>  last year, it was announced that five additional settlements were reached with more opioid distributors, and states and cities are being allocated funds to go towards prevention and community-wide rehabilitation as resulting from the national opioid epidemic. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10322.305s">The</a>  council did actually receive an update from Director of Communications earlier today with some good news. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10328.17s">We</a>  are confirmed to receive a distribution as a result of this settlement and our Board of Health and Office of Prevention Department staff has already been anticipating the five additional settlements, which is to say the city is on top of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10346.611s">which</a>  is great to hear. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10347.852s">I'm</a>  grateful to hear that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10350.034s">And</a>  just to share with the community, the update that we received, which I think was also disseminated early December, these funds can be used for sort of pertinent uses such as opioid use disorder treatment, support for people in recovery, harm reduction, prevention of opioid misuse. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10366.387s">And</a>  the city has a number of next steps that they'll be conducting community outreach about. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10372.612s">including</a>  establishing a promote prevent support behavioral health commission, um, feedback and listening sessions with the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10382.06s">And</a>  the city council will be hearing more about, um, the specific plan and role of that commission as it gets formed over the next year.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10391.068s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10392.009s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10392.189s">And</a>  just I appreciate you sharing that update. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10393.99s">And</a>  just to add to that, the information, um, that you just referenced, the update can be found on the health department's website on the city website. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10401.348s">under</a>  opioid settlement information and there's a drop down right there with some links as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10405.913s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10407.334s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10409.87s">I'd</a>  be remiss if we didn't recognize our colleague, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10413.713s">It</a>  was Councilor Caraviello's resolution under the Burke administration that got us involved in the opioid lawsuit. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10420.397s">And</a>  without his foresight and vision, we wouldn't be here today receiving these funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10425.141s">So</a>  I'd like to thank him for taking the opportunity to be invested in the war on recovery here in our city and the steps that he took to make sure that we received these funds.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10524.837s">Yeah,</a>  that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10525.477s">This</a>  is just us putting the fee of <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10528.717s">five</a>  cents per five for each square foot, about 5,000 square feet as a fee for plan development district applications into the code of ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10535.585s">So</a>  I would move to approve for first reading.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10584.812s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10586.694s">Well,</a>  I guess there's a small typo in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10589.216s">I</a>  would just amend it to strike labeled and. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10594.639s">This</a>  is one of three resolutions I have on the agenda tonight that are in the spirit of Black History Month and having gone to a few of the city's events, you know, a recurring theme is what can we do to advance social justice and racial justice in Medford? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10608.211s">And</a>  what can we do as a city government to meet the high standards that we're setting for ourselves and to listen to our residents? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10618.5s">And</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10619.696s">A</a>  few years ago, our city published a social justice roadmap, which detailed a bunch of steps that our administration and our city would take to even out the scales and to pursue a policy of equity in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10636.381s">And</a>  I think it's been about three years since the last update, and I've worked with the diversity director to kind of put this on an agenda and to kind of just <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10649.991s">talk</a>  to the administration a little bit and ask for an update and to ask for updated steps about what action steps we still need to do to reach those lofty goals.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10687.81s">Thank</a>  you, Vice Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10688.57s">Councilor</a>  Tseng, going back to your amendment, is this just saying like, in that last sentence, we're labeled just getting rid of the one hand? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10693.912s">Yeah,</a>  just get rid of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10694.692s">It</a>  is the clerk's opinion that it doesn't need to be amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10696.953s">It's</a>  just a- Oh, perfect. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10699.914s">Scrivener's</a>  error. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10702.812s">So,</a>  on the motion of cancer saying second by cancer Scarpelli Mr. Please call the role. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10712.934s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10714.274s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10716.795s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10719.095s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10721.756s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10722.596s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10723.296s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10724.636s">Yes,</a>  seven the affirmative zero negative emotion passes to three dash 054 offered by cancer saying <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10729.79s">Be</a>  it resolved the city council asked the city administration to conduct an updated racial equity study.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10735.176s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10735.837s">This</a>  one is slightly different. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10737.759s">Having</a>  talked with the diversity director feels that this is something that is standard and different municipalities that we don't miss, we haven't necessarily done here. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10746.808s">It</a>  will require not a dramatic increase increase of resources but a little bit of help up her end, which is why I'm passing this resolution from the city council side showing that there's support for me here is important. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10760.533s">Again,</a>  it's not something that would really take that much more money it's just, it's just something that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10767.395s">we</a>  again need to poke the administration a little bit and to get them to try to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10773.736s">The</a>  main difference between a racial equity study and a social justice roadmap is social justice roadmap is much broader. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10780.117s">It</a>  lays, as many have read the document, lays out general steps and policies that we need to consider. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10787.639s">The</a>  racial equity study is looking more at this very specific topic and looking at what <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10794.56s">what</a>  data we need to collect, what actions we need to take within City Hall to make a better environment for our staff, very specific, very concrete, much narrower actions.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10807.35s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10808.631s">Any</a>  further discussion? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10810.772s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Vice President Paris. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10813.754s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10818.338s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10828.319s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10829.721s">Yes,</a>  seven the in front of us here that I get the motion passes to three dash 055 offered by cancer saying it resolved the subcommittee on racial justice disabilities and elder affairs consider a welcoming city ordinance cancer site.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10842.056s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10842.636s">This</a>  one sounds a bit more ambitious than it actually is really what this is is codifying are the legal language we already have right now city policy regarding interactions with immigrants and our non cooperation policy with ice. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10858.844s">This</a>  is something that the police department already backs already has legal language from our past solicitors on. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10865.874s">This,</a>  this is really more about starting the process because a lot of, in particular, Latino and Haitian residents have reached out to me, and to see staff here, afraid to really engage with city services because they don't know if how they're <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10885.436s">know</a>  the repercussions of engaging with the city government. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10889.582s">We</a>  know that it's safe for them, but this is something that could be used to <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10897.389s">to</a>  get the word out that it is safe for them, to guarantee them their rights and safety in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10905.053s">And</a>  some residents have come up to me with the worry that because it is policy, it could change at any point in the future. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10913.396s">Whereas</a>  if we codify it right now, even just the language that we have written and approved, that would mean a lot to them and mean a lot for them to feel safe about engaging city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10925.922s">So</a>  again, this is not something that's meant to be very ambitious. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10928.706s">This</a>  is something that's meant to take the legal language we have right now that we're enforcing right now, put it into our code.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10935.254s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10936.856s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10938.418s">Well,</a>  I thank Councilor Tseng for putting this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10940.981s">I</a>  think this is a clear example where, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10945.011s">words</a>  matter and formalizing the right policy matters. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10947.552s">And</a>  I think it's, you know, a really, it puts our community in a very positive, strong light that this is a policy that our city staff are already carrying out and what we can do as a legislative body to make sure that we are using our power as a forum and a speaker box for the community to make sure that it's known to as many communities as possible, sorry, as many constituents as possible, that interfacing with any city department <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10974.847s">regardless</a>  of your immigration status, is a good thing to do, a safe thing to do, and that they can trust the outcomes of that interaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10981.788s">I</a>  think that codifying this formally will help us just promulgate that to more of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10987.11s">And</a>  so I'm happy to support this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10989.17s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10990.05s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10991.37s">Any</a>  further discussion from the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10993.491s">Councilor</a>  Saik?</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=10994.251s">I</a>  did forget to note that this is something that the Diversity Director and I have been working on as well.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11000.072s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Saik. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11002.793s">Councilor</a>  Cohen? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11004.383s">Okay,</a>  on the motion of Councilor Tseng, seconded by Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11008.686s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11011.648s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11011.828s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11033.796s">Six</a>  in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11037.398s">Going</a>  now to public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11038.978s">Are</a>  there any members of the public who would like to speak? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11041.239s">Understanding</a>  we have one remaining paper that we'll keep on for our next regular meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11048.382s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello, seeing none.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11049.883s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11050.523s">Before</a>  we adjourn, one month ago, I put something on the agenda with regards to the fountain of the Crystal Canyon Peace Guiding over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11059.982s">It's</a>  now March and it's the 10th anniversary of that tragedy. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11064.406s">I</a>  haven't seen the paper back on what I did receive something from, because we do have money in a trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11073.454s">They</a>  fixed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11077.85s">They</a>  were waiting for a piece spent George but three years with that piece very important piece of three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11083.872s">We've</a>  been waiting for that piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11088.514s">The</a>  fire truck. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11089.894s">Yes,</a>  I don't know what piece you're waiting for me to say you've been waiting for that piece of three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11093.735s">You</a>  know the celebration is in a few in a few weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11098.717s">I</a>  mean it's. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11101.279s">The</a>  seniors are really enjoying sitting out there during the summer, but like I said, it's the 10th anniversary. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11105.822s">Be</a>  ashamed if that fountain isn't up and going, especially where we have the money in the trust fund, they'll pay for that.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11112.306s">Thank</a>  you, I can follow up on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11115.348s">Great,</a>  do I have a motion to adjourn? <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11118.571s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11121.493s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/ibN3MqHgIhQ&t=11135.357s">Councilor</a>  Tseng?
