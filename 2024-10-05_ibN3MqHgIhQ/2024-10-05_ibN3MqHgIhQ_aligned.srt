00:00:02,961 --> 00:00:08,545
fifth regular meeting of the Medford City Council February 28 2023 is called to order Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2
00:00:09,566 --> 00:00:14,210
President seven present zero absent, please rise.

3
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:44,988
Announcements, accolades, remembrances, reports, and records 23-045 offered by Councilor Carviello.

4
00:00:45,628 --> 00:00:50,690
Be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Paul Howard.

5
00:00:50,790 --> 00:00:55,332
Mr. Howard was the owner of the renowned Jim's Market on Fulton Street for over 35 years.

6
00:00:55,573 --> 00:00:56,233
Councilor Carviello.

7
00:00:57,674 --> 00:00:58,795
Thank you, Madam President.

8
00:00:59,735 --> 00:01:09,941
For those of you who don't know, Mr. Howard started Jim's Market up in the Fulton Heights, and Mr. Howard has probably put Fulton Heights on the map throughout the country.

9
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:15,604
He's been on TV shows, and people drive all over for his famous b-boy.

10
00:01:15,624 --> 00:01:22,288
So, Mr. Howard, he was a good community person, and his children stayed on, keeping the store going.

11
00:01:22,328 --> 00:01:24,509
So, I just wanna, you know,

12
00:01:26,378 --> 00:01:29,323
uh, condolences to his family on his passing.

13
00:01:29,844 --> 00:01:30,906
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

14
00:01:31,286 --> 00:01:32,027
Thank you, Madam President.

15
00:01:32,047 --> 00:01:34,892
Thank you, Councilor, uh, for bringing this up.

16
00:01:35,072 --> 00:01:38,077
Uh, Mr Howard wasn't just a gentleman who

17
00:01:38,683 --> 00:01:41,864
who created an infamous breakfast sandwich.

18
00:01:42,405 --> 00:01:50,928
He's someone that fought for our country, that loved Medford, and someone that really cared about his community.

19
00:01:51,569 --> 00:02:08,336
Living up in the heights and working on the board of Little League, we'd find ourselves as parents preparing a field at 95 degrees, and without field, Mr. Howard would be walking toward you with two gallons of water just to make sure that we're hydrated.

20
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:17,186
They'll show up one day and drop off a bucket of balls that people didn't collect and make sure the kids got back went back to the kids.

21
00:02:17,807 --> 00:02:24,972
I love the story back in the blizzard of 78, when no one can leave their houses, and you had elderly families that couldn't find.

22
00:02:26,753 --> 00:02:38,188
a gallon of milk or half a loaf of bread, and Mr. Howard decided to ration off everything in his corner store to make sure everybody lasted through that difficult time in 78.

23
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,906
I send deep condolences to the Howard family.

24
00:02:44,926 --> 00:02:52,631
I know Mrs. Howard is represented by a name on the corner of Fulton Street.

25
00:02:53,131 --> 00:03:07,281
I ask the administration to, with respect, add Mr. Howard's name along with his wife in respect of that historical corner that I think everybody should drive by, walk by,

26
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:11,472
ride your bike by, look up and say, wow, I wonder who that person was.

27
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:18,557
And you can know about what it means to be a true community member and what it really means to be a Meffitt Mustang.

28
00:03:18,617 --> 00:03:25,141
Because again, I've said it too many times here, who's gonna take their place?

29
00:03:26,702 --> 00:03:35,507
People like Mr. Howard stepping, passing on, who's gonna take their place to pass on the legacies that great people from Metro made up.

30
00:03:36,738 --> 00:03:37,038
Thank you.

31
00:03:37,498 --> 00:03:39,840
Would you like it to be an amendment, please can we please thank you.

32
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:40,280
Thank you.

33
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,200
Councilor night.

34
00:03:41,961 --> 00:03:43,141
Madam President, thank you very much.

35
00:03:43,502 --> 00:03:53,267
I'd like to echo the sentiments of my fellow counselors, Paul Howard was a great man, I someone that I had the pleasure of getting to know at a very young age picture Mr Howard.

36
00:03:54,842 --> 00:04:05,047
50 plus years old, playing full court basketball at Car Park with, you know, 20, 25 kids between the ages of 15 and 25 years old and absolutely dominating.

37
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,369
Paul was an amazing athlete.

38
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:18,655
His accolades on the basketball court for Somerville High School back in the 50s and early 60s is something that I talked about very, very fondly to this day among my father and his friends.

39
00:04:19,195 --> 00:04:21,256
And whenever Paul Howard's name come up,

40
00:04:21,836 --> 00:04:28,942
They always speak of his work ethic and the type of gentleman that he was, just a kind man that went to work, put his head down and did the right thing.

41
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:34,546
He's someone that's going to be sadly missed in this community, and I'm very lucky that I had the opportunity to call him a friend.

42
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:36,928
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

43
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:46,196
So on the motion of Councilor Carviello, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Vice President Bexar, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

44
00:04:53,735 --> 00:04:53,995

So the firm is during the night of the motion passes.

62

I'm sorry, it's 23 to 063 or 063 was the clerk has enough suspension.

63
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:11,145
Oh, right.

64
00:06:11,345 --> 00:06:11,626
Okay.

65
00:06:12,486 --> 00:06:12,967
Let's take that.

66
00:06:17,732 --> 00:06:27,875
23-06 offered by Councilor Carviello and Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of former City Councilor Robert L. Maloney on his recent passing.

67
00:06:28,115 --> 00:06:34,857
Councilor Maloney served on this Council from 1976 to 2001 as a member of the City Council, as President of the City Council,

68
00:06:35,277 --> 00:06:39,438
and as Deputy Mayor under the Plan E form of government, his presence will be missed in our community.

69
00:06:39,838 --> 00:06:44,740
Be it for the resolve that the Council dedicate tonight's meeting in Councilor Maloney's memory.

70
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:45,700
Councilor Carvalho.

71
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:46,681
Thank you, Madam President.

72
00:06:46,861 --> 00:06:51,942
For those who don't know, Bob Maloney, he was a longtime City Councilor.

73
00:06:52,442 --> 00:06:59,204
He has children in this community, holding several positions in the community.

74
00:06:59,484 --> 00:06:59,805
But Bob,

75
00:07:02,438 --> 00:07:11,468
Rob was a guy who served here every week, and he's pretty strong in his convictions of what he stood for and what he won.

76
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:21,019
As you can see, he served as president and vice president, and he was deputy mayor, and he was here under the old BME form of government, where actually that's where the count really

77
00:07:21,886 --> 00:07:24,007
through the weight arounds.

78
00:07:24,947 --> 00:07:33,390
I'd like to say, I've known Bob for many years, both as a friend and he's a brother member of my Kiwanian club too.

79
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:46,374
So I'd just like to echo to his children, who are the athletic director and as a policeman, our condolences and thank you for holding this meeting tonight.

80
00:07:49,296 --> 00:07:50,637
Madam President, thank you very much.

81
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:53,439
Again, Bob Maloney Sr.

82
00:07:53,459 --> 00:07:56,781
was a gentleman that I had the opportunity of developing a great friendship with.

83
00:07:57,342 --> 00:08:06,428
I remember fondly the summer of 2005 after the passing of Senator Shannon and I was working on the Callahan campaign for State Senate and Bob Maloney Sr.

84
00:08:06,468 --> 00:08:13,733
was in the office every single day making phone calls and we'd go out knocking on doors and he had such a way about him, you know, he was great.

85
00:08:13,753 --> 00:08:14,914
He'd walk up to the door, he'd knock

86
00:08:15,314 --> 00:08:17,416
knock on the door and he'd say, Hey, I'm Bob Maloney.

87
00:08:17,476 --> 00:08:20,018
I'm the city councilor from down here in this neighborhood.

88
00:08:20,078 --> 00:08:22,260
And this is the guy we're supporting for city council.

89
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,242
So we're going to, for our state Senate.

90
00:08:24,262 --> 00:08:26,924
So we're going to put a sign on your front lawn and we're going to get you to vote for him.

91
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:27,205
All right.

92
00:08:27,685 --> 00:08:28,666
Okay, Bob, no problem.

93
00:08:29,006 --> 00:08:29,627
And they'd walk away.

94
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:30,848
The guy was amazing on the street.

95
00:08:30,888 --> 00:08:33,110
He was one of the best campaigners I've ever seen in my life.

96
00:08:34,311 --> 00:08:35,132
And he raised

97
00:08:35,812 --> 00:08:38,853
a great family of public servants that are following in his footsteps.

98
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:42,754
To Gordon, to Sean and to Bobby, my deepest condolences.

99
00:08:43,595 --> 00:08:51,137
You're all great friends and it's very sad to lose a man of your father's stature, but he's in a better place now.

100
00:08:51,217 --> 00:09:00,320
And I thank the Lord and I thank you guys for your friendship and for the opportunity to have stood beside your father during a period of time where we were able to have a lot of fun.

101
00:09:02,435 --> 00:09:03,035
Thank you, Councilman.

102
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:03,776
Councilor Scarpelli.

103
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:04,916
Thank you, Madam President.

104
00:09:04,996 --> 00:09:11,900
And I blame my passion and my outburst sometimes on Council Maloney because I learned from the best.

105
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:20,265
He would wear his emotions on his sleeve and he wouldn't be afraid to say what he thought he needed to say for what was best for the city of Medford.

106
00:09:20,886 --> 00:09:24,648
And maybe from time to time, the rumors that he might have jumped over the rail a couple times.

107
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:31,924
but he had so much passion to make sure that the city of Medford was represented in such a positive light.

108
00:09:32,184 --> 00:09:46,874
And he was a person that would take care and work for anyone in this community, whether it was in the Wellington area, West Medford, South Medford, even though he grew up, he was over at Charter Nav.

109
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:49,201
he really fought for everybody.

110
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:52,302
And, um, it's a sad day that Mr Moody's passed.

111
00:09:52,342 --> 00:09:57,144
But I know that he's left a legacy with Gordon and Sean and Bobby.

112
00:09:57,804 --> 00:10:07,046
Um, three Children that following his footsteps and giving back to their communities and, um, someone I'm very proud to have known and learn from.

113
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,747
So, um, condolences to his family.

114
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:10,647
Thank you, Madam President.

115
00:10:11,007 --> 00:10:11,868
Thank you, Mr Kelly.

116
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:16,729
So on the motion of Councilor Carbiello, seconded by Councilor Knight, Mr Clerk, please call the roll.

117
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:24,753
Yes.

118
00:10:24,793 --> 00:10:24,934
Yes.

119
00:10:24,954 --> 00:10:25,074
Yes.

120
00:10:25,114 --> 00:10:25,274
Yes.

121
00:10:50,806 --> 00:11:00,855
We do have one more paper under suspension, but so we have 22, sorry, 23-056 petition for a common bit.

122
00:11:00,955 --> 00:11:14,587
So 23-056 petition for a common bit letters license by V. Samanth Vong and Thaliphon, 9 West Green Street, apartment 2, Lynn, Massachusetts, 01902 for King Bobiti at 464B Salem Street, Metro Mass, 02155.

123
00:11:16,684 --> 00:11:17,905
I know we have the petitioner here.

124
00:11:17,925 --> 00:11:23,367
If you want to come up to the mic, and I'm going to pass it over to our licensing chair, Councilor Scarpelli.

125
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,469
Thank you for being here.

126
00:11:27,509 --> 00:11:29,850
First, business, everything looks like it's in order.

127
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:34,873
Personally, I'm going to be very upset because I'm going to be spending a lot of money.

128
00:11:35,413 --> 00:11:42,416
My daughter loves the establishment, so now that it's in our backyard, I think the family money will be spent at Boba Tea.

129
00:11:44,756 --> 00:11:47,258
So just take it easy on us, but- Thank you.

130
00:11:47,658 --> 00:11:51,981
No, I look, I see everything in order, Madam President, and I move approval.

131
00:11:52,361 --> 00:11:53,182
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

132
00:11:53,202 --> 00:11:54,522
Any further discussion from the council?

133
00:11:54,542 --> 00:11:55,623
Second.

134
00:11:56,184 --> 00:11:59,546
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, it's seconded by Councilor Carvalho.

135
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:00,666
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

136
00:12:14,848 --> 00:12:15,068
Yes.

137
00:12:15,508 --> 00:12:15,749
Yes.

138
00:12:17,449 --> 00:12:18,790
Yes.

139
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:20,031
Yes.

140
00:12:20,551 --> 00:12:20,851
Yes.

141
00:12:22,552 --> 00:12:24,332
Yes.

142
00:12:25,533 --> 00:12:25,713
Yes.

143
00:12:25,733 --> 00:12:29,195
I mean the affirmative zero and the negative the motion passes the license is approved.

144
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:29,655
Thank you.

145
00:12:29,675 --> 00:12:30,295
Congratulations.

146
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:45,743
All right.

147
00:12:46,804 --> 00:13:03,517
So while we're under suspension taking 23 dash 025 offered by Councilor Scarpelli be it resolved the city council and buddy member of the city administration Neil Osborne and a representative from the Medford fire department to discuss issues and concerns dealing with fire trucks and human resource questions.

148
00:13:04,404 --> 00:13:05,584
Councilor Scarfelli.

149
00:13:06,065 --> 00:13:06,905
Thank you, Madam President.

150
00:13:07,005 --> 00:13:10,666
I know that I appreciate Chief being here this evening.

151
00:13:10,726 --> 00:13:13,406
I know that we just had a few concerns.

152
00:13:13,647 --> 00:13:30,631
One that I know that as we're looking at our budget coming forward and understanding that we might have some issues with the fleet and seeing what we need to do, we can do as a council to try to help move things along if we need to need to.

153
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:37,607
to make sure that you get all the apparatus you need for the safety of your men and women.

154
00:13:37,687 --> 00:13:41,111
So that'll be the first thing.

155
00:13:41,131 --> 00:13:50,380
And then I know that there were some concerns about benefits for new hirees, that we can shed some light.

156
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:55,007
Okay, the benefits for the new hires, that's human resources.

157
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:58,612
So I'll have to have Mr. Osborne address you on that.

158
00:13:58,973 --> 00:14:03,820
I do know I have three members, two that were hired in February of 22 and the other one hired in September of 22.

159
00:14:07,677 --> 00:14:13,319
that there's some sort of issue with the healthcare and human resources takes care of that end of it.

160
00:14:13,379 --> 00:14:17,260
So you'd have to ask Mr. Rogers what's going on there.

161
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,781
Someone's here tonight, so I appreciate that.

162
00:14:19,041 --> 00:14:23,062
So if you can shed some light on our fleet, that would be.

163
00:14:23,242 --> 00:14:28,624
Okay, so the fleet, I'll just give you a brief summary of what's going on with the fleet.

164
00:14:29,584 --> 00:14:34,106
Obviously, we have two new ladder trucks that we've experienced some warranty issues with them.

165
00:14:35,452 --> 00:14:38,553
I have negotiated with Seagrave to extend the warranty another year.

166
00:14:39,233 --> 00:14:41,834
They have been really good standing behind me with repairing it.

167
00:14:42,354 --> 00:14:45,194
The problem is, you know, the repairs sometimes take time.

168
00:14:45,894 --> 00:14:48,975
So luckily we have two spares, so I've been able to juggle the spares.

169
00:14:48,995 --> 00:14:54,296
And one of the aerials is in Jersey right now, getting everything finished up on it.

170
00:14:55,217 --> 00:15:01,598
The other one's currently in service, and then the other two spares are, one of them's operating, the other one's in the shop also.

171
00:15:01,957 --> 00:15:12,000
Okay, so as far as the pumps go, when trucks get to a certain age and a certain number of hours and mileage, they're at the end of their usable life.

172
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:16,802
So we have two pumps that were purchased in 2000.

173
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:20,843
So that's kind of self-explanatory, they're 23 years old.

174
00:15:21,624 --> 00:15:28,806
They got pushed into the front line because of a premature frame failure on engine six, which is a 2008 PS Sabre.

175
00:15:31,434 --> 00:15:33,935
So that was something nobody could really foresee.

176
00:15:33,975 --> 00:15:41,078
It just, you know, we had it in for some maintenance and, you know, we examined the frame and we discovered that the frame was, you know, unsafe.

177
00:15:41,419 --> 00:15:43,019
So we were forced to put it out of service.

178
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:47,541
So what that did was it brought these spare apparatus to the frontline.

179
00:15:48,342 --> 00:15:54,965
And then we experienced a couple of, you know, major mechanical failures in those, which I was able to

180
00:15:55,879 --> 00:16:06,648
absorb in my budget it took up over half my maintenance budget but I was able to repair those and they're back from repairs and those are going to be run in the foreseeable future till we can get something new.

181
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:24,983
As far as like what we're going to purchase when we're going to purchase it the mayor and I are working on that on a purchase plan to figure out what we can buy and how many and that's something that's like a in progress that I really can't tell you you know we're not there yet but we're working diligently to

182
00:16:25,543 --> 00:16:27,685
figure out how we can get out of this problem.

183
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:43,679
The other issue that's come into play is, and it's part of the sort of a result of the pandemic and the supply chain interruption is these trucks to build them now, it's up to 820 days from the time you complete the order to the time the truck arrives.

184
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:45,981
So that's a little over two years.

185
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:48,943
And then if you add in the time it takes to

186
00:16:50,850 --> 00:16:55,131
put radios in them, tablets, letter them, train the personnel.

187
00:16:55,151 --> 00:16:59,332
You're talking two and a half years before you're gonna see them.

188
00:17:00,132 --> 00:17:01,332
And that keeps going up.

189
00:17:01,872 --> 00:17:10,214
Every time we wait, if we don't get it done, another month goes by, it's another month, and then we end up having to wait longer.

190
00:17:10,514 --> 00:17:15,795
So that's why we were forced to kind of repair these older trucks to kind of keep the fleet operational.

191
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,856
And that's where we're at with the fleet.

192
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:32,598
If you have any questions, I'll yeah, so I know that one of some of the residents are asking that why is there a Boston truck and I don't know if we said maybe there was a fire and they were covering and then someone said what happened with the Boston truck was.

193
00:17:34,636 --> 00:17:41,599
When we experienced the two major component failures on the other two trucks, I was forced to borrow a truck from Boston.

194
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:44,300
And they were gracious enough to give it to us for a period of time.

195
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:48,481
And they do that for other departments in the metro fire area.

196
00:17:49,582 --> 00:17:55,904
I have a good relationship with the chief and the mechanics in Boston, and they support us if I call them for something like that.

197
00:17:56,704 --> 00:18:02,289
As long as they have something available, they'll lend it with the idea that they may need it back.

198
00:18:02,529 --> 00:18:04,391
If I get that phone call, I have to give it back.

199
00:18:04,411 --> 00:18:06,632
So it saved us from browning anything out.

200
00:18:06,672 --> 00:18:10,055
We basically were running that Boston truck for a period of time.

201
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:16,060
So this, I'll say it, Chief, this seems dire.

202
00:18:17,401 --> 00:18:21,964
This should have been something that this administration should have asked for two years ago.

203
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:28,561
And this is something that is, do we have a representative from the administration?

204
00:18:29,642 --> 00:18:32,265
We have Neil Osborne, but I'm not seeing anyone.

205
00:18:32,345 --> 00:18:33,986
Okay, so that's a problem.

206
00:18:34,026 --> 00:18:42,035
So I look at that because usually when you present a capital plan like this, it's in the capital projects.

207
00:18:42,992 --> 00:18:45,593
We haven't seen, have we got an update?

208
00:18:46,214 --> 00:18:57,279
So I know that, you know, I know that the mayor put out that the station, Main Street stations now going under this, that, and the other thing, and that's great, but these are the things that frighten me.

209
00:18:57,399 --> 00:19:02,482
This is great if we have a brand new fire station, but, you know, are we gonna be,

210
00:19:03,339 --> 00:19:08,101
you know, rent in a U-Haul truck and throwing some ladders on the top, because we don't have fire engines.

211
00:19:08,161 --> 00:19:21,447
So that's what I fear right now, because as you're saying, two and a half years away, and we're in discussions about ordering them, I think this council needs to play a bigger role in this, Chief.

212
00:19:21,507 --> 00:19:30,651
I think that we need to make a motion that we need to have an emergency meeting, as committee of the whole, with procurement office, with the mayor,

213
00:19:31,611 --> 00:19:37,404
And really, let's try to figure out a way to get this audit sooner than later.

214
00:19:37,444 --> 00:19:40,591
I mean, I don't, I know it's not

215
00:19:42,022 --> 00:19:43,743
It's not a popular thing, it's tough to be up there.

216
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:55,231
I know it is, but from here, I know how dangerous your jobs are, and not to have the proper equipment that you need, whether it's turnout gear, whether it's fire trucks.

217
00:19:55,311 --> 00:19:58,453
I literally, just so I can stop you for a second.

218
00:19:58,633 --> 00:19:59,474
Maybe I wasn't clear.

219
00:19:59,514 --> 00:20:03,356
Okay, so when we, the mayor and I discussed this,

220
00:20:04,637 --> 00:20:14,365
It takes a period of time for manufacturers to quote that price, you know, the price of the apparatus and that lead time that I was just telling you about that constantly changes.

221
00:20:14,986 --> 00:20:17,468
And now they're only guaranteeing that for 30 days.

222
00:20:17,548 --> 00:20:21,831
So every time, if we go beyond the 30 days, it has to be recorded and then that takes time.

223
00:20:22,552 --> 00:20:29,918
So I recently, like two days ago, handed the mayor all the updated information on the price quote, the lead time.

224
00:20:30,738 --> 00:20:36,362
And we are in discussions, like I said, on figuring out how we're going to fund that.

225
00:20:37,062 --> 00:20:41,044
And that comes from her staff and her, not me.

226
00:20:41,224 --> 00:20:42,465
I just give her the information.

227
00:20:44,226 --> 00:20:47,709
you know, she has to make that commitment where that's gonna be done.

228
00:20:47,749 --> 00:20:51,512
And then once I get that, I can actually order the truck and get that clock ticking.

229
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:53,193
Chief, I appreciate everything you do.

230
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:54,514
I know this is nothing on you.

231
00:20:55,055 --> 00:21:02,701
What I'm saying, sitting here, we've ordered fire trucks in the past with Chief Gilberti and this administration, the administration prior to that.

232
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:05,743
So originally this council was involved.

233
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:06,584
That's what I'm trying to say.

234
00:21:07,004 --> 00:21:12,469
If we're waiting for the 30 days and you're sitting with the mayor and she's putting something together with other different departments,

235
00:21:13,129 --> 00:21:15,212
Guess who they have to come to to ask for the money?

236
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,615
They have to come here and we know nothing about it.

237
00:21:18,296 --> 00:21:21,079
I'm sure there's other department heads that are all asking for their stuff.

238
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:22,661
So she's looking at an entire city.

239
00:21:22,722 --> 00:21:24,003
I'm just looking at one.

240
00:21:24,444 --> 00:21:27,267
As a city councilor, what I'm saying, this is what I'm telling you.

241
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:27,808
You don't have to.

242
00:21:28,249 --> 00:21:29,210
I'm telling you what I see.

243
00:21:30,151 --> 00:21:33,534
is that I don't care what other departments don't have paperclips.

244
00:21:34,054 --> 00:21:38,518
Our firemen, firewomen don't have the equipment they need to succeed and be safe.

245
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:42,622
So I know it's not it's not popular for you to say it, but I can say it chief and it's okay.

246
00:21:43,242 --> 00:21:52,590
But I will tell you we need to have an emergency meeting with the mayor to see where this council falls in to make sure we're in the loop to make sure that we can hold meetings

247
00:21:53,070 --> 00:21:58,577
to clear any funding that we have to approve to make sure this happens within 30 days.

248
00:21:58,878 --> 00:21:59,819
That's all I'm trying to say.

249
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,744
And I'm only saying this because I'm in your corner.

250
00:22:03,764 --> 00:22:07,208
I want to support your people.

251
00:22:08,009 --> 00:22:08,770
This is something that

252
00:22:09,591 --> 00:22:26,760
working here for 16 years, whether on the school committee, city council, we've been directly involved when we talked about the previous fire trucks or different, different, uh, you know, uh, expenditures that we put out, whether it was for police cars or a new station or whatnot, but we were involved.

253
00:22:27,681 --> 00:22:30,342
This council has yet to see updated financials.

254
00:22:30,802 --> 00:22:32,763
So we're, we're, we're nervous chief.

255
00:22:33,203 --> 00:22:35,985
I'm nervous that we're going to get to me and we're going to come here.

256
00:22:36,005 --> 00:22:37,486
I'm going to say, forget the fire trucks, George.

257
00:22:38,944 --> 00:22:41,265
We might have to cut firemen or firewomen, and I don't want that.

258
00:22:42,285 --> 00:22:43,105
This is what I'm saying.

259
00:22:43,125 --> 00:22:55,029
We need to get together with the chief, with the mayor's office, and really start, because they've gone publicly to different arenas, and they publicly mentioned how awful the budget's gonna be this year.

260
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:57,729
And listen, I'm publicly saying this.

261
00:22:57,749 --> 00:22:58,730
I've said it a thousand times.

262
00:22:59,050 --> 00:23:04,371
I'm sounding redundant to everybody, and I sound like a crybaby at times, but I'm frightened.

263
00:23:04,711 --> 00:23:06,512
I'm nervous, because I don't know what we're doing here.

264
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,202
This council hasn't talked to anybody about what's going on.

265
00:23:10,782 --> 00:23:12,604
So thank you for coming.

266
00:23:12,664 --> 00:23:13,504
Thank you for the update.

267
00:23:13,744 --> 00:23:27,894
My recommendation is that we make motion that we call for an emergency meeting with the mayor's office to get an update on the capital plan dealing specifically with ordering the fire trucks within this 30-day window so the clock can start now.

268
00:23:27,914 --> 00:23:30,236
Does 2020 code that, Chief?

269
00:23:30,256 --> 00:23:30,516
2020 trucks?

270
00:23:33,098 --> 00:23:37,579
And the possibility is we have to make them last for at least another two and a half years if the clock started today.

271
00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:39,819
So that's why we need to get the clock started.

272
00:23:40,119 --> 00:23:46,460
We need to do whatever we need to do as a council to jump ahead of anything needed that this council needs.

273
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:53,942
So whatever we can do, that's all I'm asking, Chief, is to get the administration to sit down with us and say, whatever we need, let's get this done.

274
00:23:54,562 --> 00:23:56,182
Let's understand if we can use our money.

275
00:23:56,222 --> 00:24:00,023
Let's see if we can, you know, what other funding mechanisms we can use.

276
00:24:01,303 --> 00:24:02,664
to make sure this happens right away.

277
00:24:02,785 --> 00:24:03,665
That's that's all I'm saying.

278
00:24:03,685 --> 00:24:05,467
I mean, I'll give you an example.

279
00:24:06,128 --> 00:24:06,969
Sounds pretty dire.

280
00:24:07,409 --> 00:24:09,051
We're down a few a few trucks.

281
00:24:09,811 --> 00:24:14,116
We have a we have a motion later on resolution today for another $1.5 million in sidewalks.

282
00:24:15,116 --> 00:24:15,277
What?

283
00:24:16,618 --> 00:24:19,540
I don't we haven't even know we don't know where the last 1.5 went last year.

284
00:24:20,161 --> 00:24:22,983
So before I these are the issues that we don't know about.

285
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:28,467
That's why I asked you to come up and I know it's I know and I don't make I don't want to make you feel uncomfortable in any way chief.

286
00:24:28,507 --> 00:24:30,288
Yeah, you're doing an amazing job.

287
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:34,271
Yeah, you have one of the best departments in the city.

288
00:24:34,912 --> 00:24:40,136
I know and I speak firsthand for the way they treated my mom and my dad when they when they were leaving the service.

289
00:24:40,176 --> 00:24:42,537
So I can't say enough about them.

290
00:24:42,618 --> 00:24:44,239
So but

291
00:24:45,694 --> 00:24:48,517
We know, we can see the issues, but we haven't heard anything.

292
00:24:48,537 --> 00:24:51,080
That's why having you come up and just shed some light, I appreciate it.

293
00:24:51,301 --> 00:24:51,881
So thank you.

294
00:24:52,082 --> 00:24:52,382
Thank you.

295
00:24:58,569 --> 00:24:59,350
Thank you, Madam President.

296
00:24:59,410 --> 00:24:59,571
Chief.

297
00:25:04,437 --> 00:25:10,421
I know in the past, I think our last one, didn't we do a lease to own on our last two fire trucks?

298
00:25:10,781 --> 00:25:12,462
We did lease purchase on both ladders.

299
00:25:12,482 --> 00:25:12,703
Right.

300
00:25:13,083 --> 00:25:15,284
And tied them with the casino money.

301
00:25:15,464 --> 00:25:16,345
Okay.

302
00:25:16,365 --> 00:25:21,428
So they did a 10-year lease on each truck, and that money each year pays for the lease purchase.

303
00:25:21,689 --> 00:25:23,069
It's a 10-year lease purchase.

304
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:26,212
So I'm assuming we're going to look to do the same thing going forward?

305
00:25:27,172 --> 00:25:29,174
That's a question you have to ask the administration.

306
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,315
It all depends on how they want to fund it.

307
00:25:31,495 --> 00:25:34,317
There's many different ways they could choose to fund it.

308
00:25:35,177 --> 00:25:39,858
And I know between you and the former chief how long it takes to get these trucks.

309
00:25:41,219 --> 00:25:41,779
Say that again.

310
00:25:42,139 --> 00:25:46,480
I said I know between yourself and the former chief how long it takes to get a fire truck.

311
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:48,080
I know it takes almost.

312
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:53,782
So that's what I was trying to explain earlier was that that time frame keeps changing.

313
00:25:54,282 --> 00:26:00,303
So at the end of 30 days, say a bunch of departments order 50 trucks, that could turn into 900.

314
00:26:00,463 --> 00:26:04,064
It could just keep going up because you get behind in the line.

315
00:26:05,137 --> 00:26:06,898
And I thank Councilor Scott for bringing that up.

316
00:26:06,938 --> 00:26:07,519
And what does she mean?

317
00:26:07,539 --> 00:26:12,703
Because the three workhorses in the community are the police, fire, and DPW.

318
00:26:13,504 --> 00:26:15,786
And what about those three departments?

319
00:26:16,406 --> 00:26:20,409
So like for example, the ladder trucks, they took 400 days back then.

320
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:28,656
But since the pandemic and the supply chain interruption and material shortages, all the departments are in the same kind of problem.

321
00:26:28,716 --> 00:26:29,677
They're trying to get trucks.

322
00:26:30,337 --> 00:26:36,042
And what happens is that lead time just keeps going up and up and up as more and more departments order.

323
00:26:36,882 --> 00:26:40,746
And like I said, that supply chain interruption, we're still seeing the effects of that.

324
00:26:44,246 --> 00:26:44,586
market?

325
00:26:44,986 --> 00:26:45,547
I don't know.

326
00:26:45,827 --> 00:26:47,928
Right now, we looked around, there's nothing around.

327
00:26:47,948 --> 00:26:49,089
I mean, I don't know.

328
00:26:49,129 --> 00:26:49,569
I don't know.

329
00:26:49,629 --> 00:26:51,850
Obviously, obviously entertain that.

330
00:26:51,971 --> 00:26:57,314
Yeah, like, we borrow from Boston, I even tried to buy one of those.

331
00:26:57,674 --> 00:26:58,434
Just too precious.

332
00:26:58,454 --> 00:26:59,395
They're not letting go of them.

333
00:26:59,795 --> 00:26:59,975
Yeah.

334
00:27:00,195 --> 00:27:01,356
So and then there's nothing around.

335
00:27:01,396 --> 00:27:02,477
We just we looked around.

336
00:27:02,497 --> 00:27:03,297
There really isn't.

337
00:27:03,838 --> 00:27:04,938
Everyone's in the same.

338
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:05,999
It's not just Medford.

339
00:27:06,039 --> 00:27:07,760
It's not a whole metro fire community.

340
00:27:09,901 --> 00:27:12,983
You know, we try to see if we could, you know, like,

341
00:27:13,905 --> 00:27:16,347
work on a purchase for some of those used trucks.

342
00:27:17,267 --> 00:27:25,452
And even though they're not ideal, when we have a component failure on the two older 23-year-old trucks, that's not something ideal.

343
00:27:25,472 --> 00:27:29,735
I didn't want to fix those, but I had to because I couldn't find anything better used.

344
00:27:30,255 --> 00:27:31,736
We knew exactly what those were.

345
00:27:32,648 --> 00:27:38,973
And it was, it was a lot of money, but you know, I had enough in the budget that I could absorb it, but it took up over half my maintenance budget.

346
00:27:38,993 --> 00:27:45,859
So what's going to happen in the summer when we got a maintenance stuff, we're going to get, it's going to be very tight this year because of those failures.

347
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,041
So, um,

348
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:53,811
You know, that's, and the other issue that happens is if you don't have spares, you can't maintenance the fleet.

349
00:27:54,071 --> 00:27:54,391
That's right.

350
00:27:54,571 --> 00:27:58,072
So it's not like I'm, you know, adding an extra truck so I can have extra trucks.

351
00:27:58,152 --> 00:28:01,333
It's, you know, if engine one needs maintenance, you gotta have something to back it up.

352
00:28:01,373 --> 00:28:05,334
Yeah, no, and I understand, you know, when they go off for repairs, they're out there for a couple of months.

353
00:28:06,395 --> 00:28:10,856
So the other issue that's happening is we're running, our run totals went way up.

354
00:28:10,896 --> 00:28:14,097
So we went from, say, under 10,000 to over 12.

355
00:28:14,477 --> 00:28:16,277
We're almost 13,000 runs a year.

356
00:28:16,898 --> 00:28:18,198
So now engine one, for example,

357
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:20,809
73,000 miles on it already.

358
00:28:21,470 --> 00:28:23,054
So, you know, it's a 2018.

359
00:28:24,156 --> 00:28:29,407
So think about that, you know, those trucks are in two and a half years, they're going to have almost 100,000 miles on them.

360
00:28:31,212 --> 00:28:32,612
So that's the other issue.

361
00:28:32,652 --> 00:28:35,073
We're trying to get them ordered so we can rotate the fleet.

362
00:28:35,093 --> 00:28:41,534
Like in the past, we'd get them in before they got, like say they get to 40,000, then we rotate them and the new stuff comes in.

363
00:28:41,574 --> 00:28:52,056
But because of this huge two and a half year delay, engine one and engine four, they're gonna run to the point where they're gonna have almost 100,000 on them when we go to rotate.

364
00:28:52,876 --> 00:28:57,037
And you know, I would hope that, you know, going forward that, you know, the plan would be to,

365
00:28:59,992 --> 00:29:06,956
As soon as we buy one and get it delivered, we order another one just to keep rotating.

366
00:29:07,116 --> 00:29:10,618
Some cities have, like I put some stuff into the CIP.

367
00:29:10,658 --> 00:29:12,820
If you look at it, it's there.

368
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:17,362
You know, to buy one a year till we get three of them or buy three up front.

369
00:29:17,402 --> 00:29:18,503
There's different options you can do.

370
00:29:19,229 --> 00:29:28,876
But with the delay, if you buy one a year, so we would get the first one in 25, and then the second one would come in 26, and then 27, you'd start to see some relief.

371
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:32,860
But in other cities, what they do is they don't keep trucks this long.

372
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:39,344
They have city ordinances where they, every so many years you buy a pump, and every so many years you buy a ladder.

373
00:29:40,385 --> 00:29:46,370
Before they get to that age where they're having those major component failures that I was talking about.

374
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:49,731
Maybe that's an ordinance that we look to put in going forward.

375
00:29:49,971 --> 00:29:56,913
I thank you for- Yeah, maybe going forward we can present those kind of ideas, look into what other cities do and come up with a plan.

376
00:29:56,973 --> 00:29:59,114
But right now we're kind of in an emergency mode.

377
00:29:59,134 --> 00:30:01,354
We've got to kind of correct what's wrong here first.

378
00:30:01,914 --> 00:30:05,976
And let me say, your department, lives matter in your department.

379
00:30:06,256 --> 00:30:06,876
You save lives.

380
00:30:06,896 --> 00:30:14,358
So I would hope that we can get this emergency meeting in so you can get your 30 days and get it off and going because they say,

381
00:30:16,101 --> 00:30:17,882
two years.

382
00:30:17,902 --> 00:30:21,384
I do have to say this is that we were literally talking today.

383
00:30:21,404 --> 00:30:22,264
We're going to work on it.

384
00:30:22,344 --> 00:30:26,746
So I think what we just need to do is guys, if you want to be involved, we'll just stop talking.

385
00:30:26,766 --> 00:30:28,347
We can do a little more work and a little more action.

386
00:30:29,468 --> 00:30:33,450
I'm going to say also, I'm going to support councilor Scott's motion to have an emergency meeting.

387
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:36,251
So, you know, you can get that order up there as quick as possible.

388
00:30:36,971 --> 00:30:37,232
Thank you.

389
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:37,572
Okay.

390
00:30:37,632 --> 00:30:37,932
Thank you.

391
00:30:39,973 --> 00:30:43,815
Any further discussion from the councilors on this part of the resolution?

392
00:30:45,458 --> 00:30:47,659
And back to you, Councilor Scott Peli.

393
00:30:47,719 --> 00:30:48,159
Thank you.

394
00:30:48,239 --> 00:30:49,259
Is Mr. Osborne present?

395
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:49,780
He is.

396
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:56,682
He is online.

397
00:30:56,702 --> 00:31:01,664
Good evening, Council President Morrell and other members of the City Council.

398
00:31:02,465 --> 00:31:10,147
I know back in early February, I was asked to summarize the issue with a few firefighters.

399
00:31:10,187 --> 00:31:14,109
I don't know if Councilor Scott Peli has a specific question or any other.

400
00:31:15,013 --> 00:31:16,615
Members of the Council have questions.

401
00:31:17,336 --> 00:31:23,925
I know since then when the issue was brought to my attention, we have improved our communication with new hires.

402
00:31:24,766 --> 00:31:33,037
Initially back in February we were asking them to come to City Council, come to Human Resources to make an appointment to make sure the paperwork got done.

403
00:31:33,857 --> 00:31:34,998
done timely.

404
00:31:35,359 --> 00:31:59,536
We have now set specific time frames when a new person is hired, it doesn't matter whether it's fire, DPW or police, there's a specific time frame where they're going to come, meet with the benefits coordinator so that anyone who actually wants the city insurance can sign up for it and have it be filed with GIC in a timely manner so that they can actually have coverage.

405
00:32:00,289 --> 00:32:06,271
Again, I don't know if there's any specific question that you would like to have answered, available to answer anything that I can.

406
00:32:06,291 --> 00:32:07,852
Okay, thank you.

407
00:32:08,012 --> 00:32:09,612
I appreciate the response.

408
00:32:10,072 --> 00:32:28,499
And I think probably my biggest question is that, I know the fire was first brought up, but since then, I was told that there might be some concerns with new hires at DPW, and new hires with the police department, and the lack of truly, lack of true communication with going back and forth.

409
00:32:29,259 --> 00:32:35,522
that you sent us a clarifying email, and I appreciate that, but I have a question on that.

410
00:32:36,942 --> 00:32:43,825
It seems that the comment that when open enrollment is closed, there's no way to get anybody on, correct?

411
00:32:44,646 --> 00:32:45,326
Is that correct?

412
00:32:45,985 --> 00:32:47,227
It's extremely difficult.

413
00:32:47,407 --> 00:32:49,910
Again, we are a member of GIC.

414
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:59,581
They are the gatekeepers, and we do our best to try and make sure that any employee who is new to us has the opportunity to sign up.

415
00:33:01,098 --> 00:33:23,803
So just so you know, Mr. Osborne, I did contact a couple of neighboring communities and talked with the benefits managers, and I know that they have different systems set up that it's a 60-day waiting period once they are hired, no matter what month of the year it is, that if they were hired in January and February, they would then be, you know,

416
00:33:24,543 --> 00:33:27,165
added on to the insurance for GIC on April 1st.

417
00:33:27,546 --> 00:33:28,466
That's for example.

418
00:33:28,907 --> 00:33:31,008
Another example is February to March.

419
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:32,950
They would then be hired May 1st.

420
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:34,051
They would have the GIC.

421
00:33:35,252 --> 00:33:42,197
I've talked to a few people in a few HI departments that have also told me that it's not uncommon

422
00:33:43,178 --> 00:33:52,504
for a relationship with the members of GIC and I have a call with them tomorrow to just give them a call and say, hey, listen, be a little persistent.

423
00:33:52,524 --> 00:34:01,170
I believe one benefits person told me that all she really needs to do is call them three times in a day and they'll get somebody on if it's really needed.

424
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:08,875
So I think that's that, I'm a little confused with what you sent and then what I've heard from GIC itself.

425
00:34:09,135 --> 00:34:10,116
And then the other piece is,

426
00:34:12,654 --> 00:34:14,655
are all the firefighters that were hired.

427
00:34:15,116 --> 00:34:18,858
I know back in February that wants insurance.

428
00:34:19,499 --> 00:34:22,901
Have they been given their insurance or are they still waiting for the insurance?

429
00:34:22,941 --> 00:34:32,267
Second question is, do there's still issues with the police that had some concerns and some issues and with DPW?

430
00:34:32,547 --> 00:34:33,808
If you can answer that, that'd be great.

431
00:34:34,816 --> 00:34:39,940
I guess I can only answer for those who brought that issue to my attention.

432
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,903
So the key component of getting someone insurance is for them to sign up for it.

433
00:34:44,943 --> 00:34:51,567
There's no automatic way for us in human resources to decide what an individual will want.

434
00:34:51,627 --> 00:35:00,673
So if they come to us, we can figure out exactly what their needs are and then try and work with them if they don't have insurance to try and get them insurance.

435
00:35:01,374 --> 00:35:04,256
Right now, I don't know of anyone on the fire that

436
00:35:05,597 --> 00:35:08,459
wanted insurance and it's without insurance, doesn't have it.

437
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:22,450
Okay, so that's alarming to me because I think that when I hire a new person in my position, I work with my HR benefits coordinator in the HR.

438
00:35:22,970 --> 00:35:25,192
As they go on to the onboarding process,

439
00:35:26,325 --> 00:35:28,786
the, this is part of their process.

440
00:35:29,286 --> 00:35:39,710
Are you telling us that when they're going through the onboarding process, when they're hired for the city of Medford, that that's not the job of the HR department to follow through to make sure they're doing that?

441
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:43,932
Because you're making it sound that they have to come to you separately and ask for it.

442
00:35:44,412 --> 00:35:55,201
So that was back in February, the offer letter specifically said, hey, come make an appointment so that we have the opportunity to figure out what you need, get the paperwork signed and get it in.

443
00:35:55,942 --> 00:36:06,051
Unfortunately, back in February, there was a lack of staff that happened that reduced the ability to respond quickly.

444
00:36:06,852 --> 00:36:11,916
But once the issue was brought to our attention, we began to work with any firefighter that didn't have it.

445
00:36:12,799 --> 00:36:16,941
and sort of make that request to GIC to see what could be done.

446
00:36:17,401 --> 00:36:26,765
And again, from the group that started in February, I don't know of anyone of that group who has come to Human Resources and said, hey, we need help.

447
00:36:26,845 --> 00:36:28,806
And again, we remain open and available.

448
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:29,907
Come talk to us.

449
00:36:30,327 --> 00:36:33,809
It's easier if you make an appointment, then we can give you the dedicated time.

450
00:36:33,829 --> 00:36:41,012
I know folks, no matter what department you work in, you can stop in at HR, but you can get better service if you just give us a little heads up.

451
00:36:44,028 --> 00:36:51,522
And I'm not just putting blame, I know that you seem to be a team of one, Mr. Osborne.

452
00:36:52,304 --> 00:36:54,408
You know, we're fortunate that we have

453
00:36:55,393 --> 00:37:02,618
teams of six to eight that are working where we're onboarding people, at least that's what it sounds like to me, that you're alone.

454
00:37:02,738 --> 00:37:06,580
So that seems to be an issue in itself.

455
00:37:07,281 --> 00:37:23,752
So right now, you know, no firemen, that everybody has, I know that I've gotten some calls from firemen that they still haven't had their insurance applied to their benefits,

456
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:27,112
but no one's reached out to you to let you know that.

457
00:37:27,732 --> 00:37:27,893
Right.

458
00:37:27,933 --> 00:37:38,341
So again, I know the union has brought it to our attention and we've asked them if a firefighter has an issue, please bring it to our attention.

459
00:37:38,441 --> 00:37:39,722
We can meet with them, figure it out.

460
00:37:40,422 --> 00:37:46,587
I know I've written one of the employees from February saying just to make sure that there was no miscommunication.

461
00:37:46,687 --> 00:37:48,889
If you have an issue, come talk to us.

462
00:37:48,949 --> 00:37:49,729
We can figure it out.

463
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:50,770
That's what our role is.

464
00:37:51,131 --> 00:37:52,832
We're there to try and provide that service.

465
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:57,626
to the employees and also assist department heads when they get new employees.

466
00:37:57,646 --> 00:37:58,708
So we're there.

467
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:00,331
Come talk to us.

468
00:38:00,371 --> 00:38:03,617
We'll gladly do whatever we can to try and help folks out.

469
00:38:06,405 --> 00:38:24,077
If I can, I know that representatives Buckley and Jones have reached out and mentioned that they would like to come to the meeting and maybe if you can, if there's any way, gentlemen, if you can, just enlighten me.

470
00:38:25,018 --> 00:38:35,505
I was told, I was led to believe that there were firemen and women that were hired back in February that have yet to be granted insurance.

471
00:38:36,165 --> 00:38:40,408
or offered other avenues to get their own insurance.

472
00:38:40,869 --> 00:38:46,253
So I just want to make sure that if this is a wrong that we fix it, that

473
00:38:47,987 --> 00:38:52,008
We look at the departments that need to get on board to make sure this happens.

474
00:38:52,428 --> 00:38:59,890
And I know that the police reached out as well, and representatives from DPW had some same concerns.

475
00:38:59,930 --> 00:39:09,052
And I guess that since they're not specific to this, I'll call for a separate resolution with the police to understand how that's transpired.

476
00:39:09,995 --> 00:39:14,318
Uh, if you could shed some light and your members appreciate just name and address for the record.

477
00:39:14,518 --> 00:39:18,660
Walter Buckley, president of 10 32 method firefighters, 3 47 street.

478
00:39:19,881 --> 00:39:27,965
So we currently have three members working for the fight apartment that do not have health insurance to the city that one health insurance to the city.

479
00:39:29,146 --> 00:39:31,087
Um, the first one is Brian Lee.

480
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:37,271
He received a letter from the city on February 2nd standing yet to meet with H. R.

481
00:39:39,667 --> 00:39:42,208
and set up an appointment to go over their benefits.

482
00:39:43,488 --> 00:39:50,390
And I believe the GIC requires you to sign up for insurance within 60 days of your first day of getting paid.

483
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,451
So he was not, he never made the appointment apparently.

484
00:39:54,811 --> 00:39:58,332
He got the letter, you have a lot of things running through your head when you're going to the fire academy.

485
00:39:58,752 --> 00:40:03,854
You gotta get your shit together, you have to resign probably from your former job.

486
00:40:03,874 --> 00:40:05,254
Ship together.

487
00:40:05,314 --> 00:40:06,535
Ship, yes.

488
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:07,495
One of them was a sailor.

489
00:40:11,798 --> 00:40:14,018
I know, I apologize.

490
00:40:15,319 --> 00:40:17,219
It's not fun being up here for this.

491
00:40:18,879 --> 00:40:20,800
You have to buy equipment, clothing.

492
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:25,701
You have to get your life together because you're going away for a couple of months at the academy.

493
00:40:26,701 --> 00:40:40,184
So yeah, maybe it slipped someone's mind that when he got the letter, he didn't sign up for the insurance, but you would think it's the HR department's job to reach out to those members and say, hey, you don't have insurance.

494
00:40:40,224 --> 00:40:41,264
We need to get your insurance.

495
00:40:42,298 --> 00:40:55,848
They do require you, the city HR department requires you to provide proof of insurance when you opt out of our insurance, but they don't require proof of insurance in the initial.

496
00:40:56,148 --> 00:40:58,270
So if you want to opt in, you opt in.

497
00:40:58,850 --> 00:41:02,413
If you don't want the insurance, they don't say, where's your proof?

498
00:41:02,593 --> 00:41:03,734
We need proof of insurance.

499
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:09,944
So to us, it means that they only require proof of insurance when it's gonna cost the city money.

500
00:41:10,685 --> 00:41:12,205
They don't care that you don't have insurance.

501
00:41:12,225 --> 00:41:20,409
They're not gonna ask you if you have proof of insurance because we have three guys that don't have insurance right now and they never called them and said, hey, you don't have insurance, you need to sign up.

502
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:22,370
So if I can interrupt.

503
00:41:23,130 --> 00:41:24,571
So I know it's a two month period.

504
00:41:25,091 --> 00:41:27,172
So we figured out in February, they didn't have insurance.

505
00:41:27,892 --> 00:41:29,413
So they didn't have that meeting.

506
00:41:30,033 --> 00:41:30,774
It's still a year.

507
00:41:31,594 --> 00:41:33,075
Have they had that meeting since then?

508
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:36,240
All right, so the first one, Brian Lee.

509
00:41:37,181 --> 00:41:39,503
Completed the paperwork in May of 2022.

510
00:41:41,644 --> 00:41:45,487
Was told by HR that his paycheck would reflect it in June or July.

511
00:41:45,987 --> 00:41:47,428
Went back to HR in August.

512
00:41:47,909 --> 00:41:49,570
Was told to resubmit the paperwork.

513
00:41:50,210 --> 00:41:52,452
Went back to HR in October or November.

514
00:41:53,252 --> 00:41:55,334
Was told he never handed in the paperwork.

515
00:41:55,814 --> 00:42:00,358
And then was told he did hand in the paperwork, but there was a communication problem with GIC.

516
00:42:01,929 --> 00:42:09,676
In January of 2023, same individual met with Neil and Candace, was told paperwork was submitted to GIC but delayed.

517
00:42:10,636 --> 00:42:14,259
Was told he would have to wait till April 2023 for open enrollment.

518
00:42:15,701 --> 00:42:23,427
In the meantime, he could pay for his outside insurance and he would be reimbursed up to 85% for all costs.

519
00:42:24,608 --> 00:42:29,693
Candace apologized and stated it might have been their fault and Neil landed on the GIC.

520
00:42:30,933 --> 00:42:37,317
Candace took his information again, said she would write a letter to the GIC because she thought it was their fault.

521
00:42:38,298 --> 00:42:43,921
And if the paperwork is accepted in April, he won't have any insurance till July of 2023.

522
00:42:44,001 --> 00:42:53,507
So they're saying right now, if Mr. Lee submits his paperwork in April, he's out of that 60 day period to sign up.

523
00:42:54,288 --> 00:42:59,091
They're saying if it's approved, he'll have insurance in July.

524
00:43:00,506 --> 00:43:06,688
Now, imagine working for a year and saying, I have no insurance, I have no insurance, I have no insurance.

525
00:43:06,909 --> 00:43:15,912
Open enrollment comes in and they're telling them, if you get accepted, like, people have families and kids and bills and prescriptions.

526
00:43:17,032 --> 00:43:19,473
They have to deal with this, nevermind the job that we do.

527
00:43:19,493 --> 00:43:20,934
We have to deal with that.

528
00:43:22,014 --> 00:43:25,996
And to deal with this administration, and that's one person, Sonny Borelli.

529
00:43:26,736 --> 00:43:28,177
He didn't even know he didn't have insurance.

530
00:43:29,269 --> 00:43:31,671
So he didn't call him up and say, hey, you didn't sign up for insurance.

531
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:34,532
He didn't even know until July that he didn't have insurance.

532
00:43:35,373 --> 00:43:41,137
He's a single guy, so he's probably not thinking, oh, I gotta get my wife and kids and whatever.

533
00:43:41,177 --> 00:43:43,978
So we contacted him July 1st of 2022.

534
00:43:44,999 --> 00:43:47,160
July 6th, he went to speak with Neil Osborne.

535
00:43:48,121 --> 00:43:53,524
Neil told him he couldn't help him because the benefits coordinator wasn't in the office and to come back next week.

536
00:43:54,945 --> 00:43:55,285
July 13th,

537
00:43:56,485 --> 00:43:59,606
He spoke with Candace and received the health benefits package.

538
00:44:00,226 --> 00:44:02,467
July 20th, he returned the package completed.

539
00:44:02,487 --> 00:44:05,007
Neil was in the office.

540
00:44:05,387 --> 00:44:09,008
He said he didn't want to take it and he was told to come back and give it to Candace.

541
00:44:10,109 --> 00:44:12,809
July 27th, he handed the completed package to Candace.

542
00:44:13,069 --> 00:44:18,171
So three times he went to the HR and twice he was turned away from the HR director.

543
00:44:19,011 --> 00:44:19,631
I can't help you.

544
00:44:20,611 --> 00:44:22,392
What's your job if you're the director of HR?

545
00:44:24,465 --> 00:44:28,588
If you can't help someone when they come in and need help, what's gonna happen to that person when he leaves?

546
00:44:29,168 --> 00:44:32,371
So more importantly, so July, everything was handed in.

547
00:44:32,991 --> 00:44:33,331
Correct.

548
00:44:33,551 --> 00:44:35,233
August, September, he should have been on.

549
00:44:35,733 --> 00:44:36,293
Is he on now?

550
00:44:37,134 --> 00:44:37,574
No.

551
00:44:39,876 --> 00:44:44,559
Jeremiah O'Brien received a letter on August 11th, 2022.

552
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:48,662
He was required to meet with HR on August 24th, 2022 at 5.30.

553
00:44:48,702 --> 00:44:49,483
He didn't show up to that meeting.

554
00:44:53,288 --> 00:45:05,371
But he did get sworn in on, I believe it was 9-15 or 9-13, where he completed all the paperwork at his swearing.

555
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:08,932
He graduated the academy November 28th of 2022.

556
00:45:12,011 --> 00:45:22,334
December 16th, he went to HR and was told they were working on the issue, and if he was paying for insurance or medical costs, to turn in the receipts and he would be reimbursed.

557
00:45:22,895 --> 00:45:25,415
And he filled out a second healthcare package.

558
00:45:26,556 --> 00:45:39,420
July 29th, he filled out his third healthcare package, was told they are doing their best to get him covered and working with GIC, and that HR would contact him regarding this issue.

559
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:52,160
January 16th, 2023, he went to HR and was told that he never turned in his paperwork, or that they might have misplaced them.

560
00:45:53,801 --> 00:46:02,847
He was then told it was too late to enroll, but they would contact him when they get an answer from HR regarding this health insurance issue.

561
00:46:03,247 --> 00:46:06,930
That was January 16th, no one has contacted him since.

562
00:46:09,039 --> 00:46:13,380
Those are the three members that do not have health insurance right now, that want health insurance.

563
00:46:16,782 --> 00:46:21,783
So if I can, Mr. Osborne, if you're still there, I don't.

564
00:46:24,338 --> 00:46:37,880
Obviously, is there a way that we can, first of all, correct this by helping these three firefighters get their GIC benefits ASAP?

565
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:47,562
Because I know that talking to, there's an open pipeline when you express these concerns to GIC directly with issues like this.

566
00:46:48,682 --> 00:46:50,122
It takes days to get them on.

567
00:46:50,203 --> 00:46:52,883
Is there any way, do we have that possible in Medford or no?

568
00:46:55,356 --> 00:47:00,338
Um, uh, through the, uh, council president, the answer to that question is no.

569
00:47:00,939 --> 00:47:09,083
Um, I'm not going to go, um, item for item over the misstatements made by, uh, uh, Mr. Buckley.

570
00:47:09,663 --> 00:47:15,226
We as a human resources department remain committed to helping employees.

571
00:47:15,686 --> 00:47:23,810
They may not have, uh, but the city's available insurance, but if they get to us and they talk to us about what they need.

572
00:47:24,494 --> 00:47:28,458
We will do our best to help them, which includes having discussions with D.I.C.

573
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:32,382
If I could to the chair, please.

574
00:47:33,263 --> 00:47:35,004
We've we've gone to numerous times.

575
00:47:35,885 --> 00:47:37,747
Numerous people have gone to numerous times.

576
00:47:37,927 --> 00:47:39,188
These people still don't have insurance.

577
00:47:39,208 --> 00:47:39,869
So how are you?

578
00:47:43,012 --> 00:47:46,615
So, so, Mr. Osmond, what I'm trying to figure out is if we

579
00:47:48,051 --> 00:48:00,798
If we talk with the firefighters that are in question, and they come to your office tomorrow, do we have someone in place that can assist them to make sure that this is corrected and we don't, nothing happens again?

580
00:48:00,858 --> 00:48:03,540
Whether it's one side or the other right now, I don't care.

581
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,821
I wanna make sure these firefighters have insurance.

582
00:48:07,222 --> 00:48:07,702
Is that possible?

583
00:48:07,722 --> 00:48:12,665
Again, let's make sure, through the chair, we need to be talking about the same things.

584
00:48:13,465 --> 00:48:16,347
Having insurance is different from having the city's insurance.

585
00:48:17,497 --> 00:48:23,719
The group insurance commission controls when someone is eligible for insurance.

586
00:48:24,099 --> 00:48:27,680
We can't wave a magic wand and make it happen today or tomorrow.

587
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,540
It's a process that has to be followed.

588
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:32,241
And again, I keep saying it.

589
00:48:32,761 --> 00:48:34,981
Have the individuals come and speak with us.

590
00:48:35,601 --> 00:48:36,702
Simply make an appointment.

591
00:48:36,742 --> 00:48:38,082
You get the dedicated time.

592
00:48:38,826 --> 00:48:39,707
We've got a lot to do.

593
00:48:39,867 --> 00:48:43,029
We're trying to manage a lot of different other employees.

594
00:48:43,649 --> 00:48:46,251
If the employee needs our service, come in.

595
00:48:46,471 --> 00:48:47,311
We'll talk to them.

596
00:48:47,692 --> 00:48:51,054
We'll do our level best to resolve any issue.

597
00:48:52,695 --> 00:48:53,775
So my hope is this.

598
00:48:54,616 --> 00:49:07,264
My hope is that with the leadership of the fire department, that we can reach out to those three firefighters, that they can go to Mr. Osborne's office tomorrow and see what needs to be done right now so we can get that clock

599
00:49:07,884 --> 00:49:08,745
that clock ticking.

600
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:24,394
But I will tell you Mr Osborne and I can I can have I can share some contacts with you with G. I see that there is a possibility when situations like this arise that you can call them and they can't support you within days that I know we've dealt with it.

601
00:49:24,775 --> 00:49:29,758
So what I find more alarming to me is that we don't have a system

602
00:49:30,578 --> 00:49:42,107
in our HR department that this isn't a natural onboarding system where they come in, fill out the paperwork, do the GIC stuff together, and that happens.

603
00:49:42,127 --> 00:49:49,692
That's more alarming to me than anything because this wouldn't have happened if we didn't have a competent system in place like other communities.

604
00:49:49,712 --> 00:49:50,433
This isn't odd.

605
00:49:50,513 --> 00:49:51,113
This isn't new.

606
00:49:51,934 --> 00:50:04,758
This is, private entities, as they come in, if you work with a private entity and you walked in and you sat down with the HR directors of that company, that's part of the onboarding system of acquiring healthcare.

607
00:50:05,058 --> 00:50:09,539
That's probably one of the, after the salary, that's probably the most important thing you're looking at.

608
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:15,881
So I think that that's what I'm more alarmed right now is that we don't have that process in place.

609
00:50:16,281 --> 00:50:20,202
Because I heard what you said, and what's alarming to me is that you're saying

610
00:50:21,641 --> 00:50:35,153
let the people that we're hiring, who, by the way, we're having a very difficult time finding people to work in Medford, that they have to come and search for you so they can get the benefits that they are required to have.

611
00:50:35,814 --> 00:50:37,415
Because every city employee

612
00:50:38,676 --> 00:50:40,799
is required to the option of GIC.

613
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:41,881
So I don't know.

614
00:50:41,901 --> 00:50:48,410
I don't want to get in between what was said here, what was said there.

615
00:50:48,430 --> 00:50:49,271
I really don't.

616
00:50:49,292 --> 00:50:51,174
What I want is these three firefighters

617
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,685
to get their insurance as quickly as possible.

618
00:50:55,426 --> 00:51:08,858
And if you'd like to, I'll share that tomorrow with the information that I can get to you, that there's contacts at GIC that I've worked with directly that can help with onboarding special situations, like seems to be this one.

619
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:12,402
So this is, from what I gather, I'm not confused.

620
00:51:13,715 --> 00:51:24,999
From what I was told, Mr. Osborne, is that all three firefighters that are having issues all wanted the GIC and the city's insurance, correct?

621
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:27,260
All of them have been to HI.

622
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:31,001
All of them have communicated to the union multiple times.

623
00:51:31,602 --> 00:51:35,043
We were never told, come in right now, we'll get you signed up.

624
00:51:35,683 --> 00:51:37,744
They were told, go get your own insurance.

625
00:51:39,318 --> 00:51:40,258
We'll reimburse you.

626
00:51:40,278 --> 00:51:53,963
Okay, so for today, what I would love to do is get these three firefighters there tomorrow with our benefits officer and our HR director, and let's get the clock started tomorrow.

627
00:51:54,323 --> 00:51:55,523
Let's get them get their insurance.

628
00:51:55,843 --> 00:52:00,325
And moving forward, we need to figure out what we want.

629
00:52:00,905 --> 00:52:03,506
So the chair, excuse me, but for decades,

630
00:52:04,315 --> 00:52:08,559
You came in, you swore in, you signed up for your health insurance, and then you went home.

631
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,842
You weren't allowed to go home unless you signed up.

632
00:52:11,522 --> 00:52:12,664
So that was common practice.

633
00:52:12,684 --> 00:52:14,486
So that changed a couple years ago.

634
00:52:16,223 --> 00:52:21,466
Now again, when you go into HR, you expect help, especially from the HR coordinator.

635
00:52:21,927 --> 00:52:26,830
If he says his secretary's not here and I can't help you, come back next week, that's not a great answer.

636
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:28,491
And he's calling me a liar.

637
00:52:28,511 --> 00:52:30,832
I have an email from right here.

638
00:52:31,452 --> 00:52:34,975
Despite our efforts to encourage them to make an appointment to meet with us,

639
00:52:36,061 --> 00:52:42,224
about health coverage needs, we have not heard from either Firefighter Borelli or Firefighter Dominique.

640
00:52:42,705 --> 00:52:51,849
I just told you of three different times that Borelli went to HR and Neil himself told him, can't help you, secretary's nodding, come back.

641
00:52:54,991 --> 00:52:56,172
Didn't mistake that one.

642
00:52:57,633 --> 00:52:58,873
Those are your words, not mine.

643
00:53:00,514 --> 00:53:03,636
The fact that these guys are still over a year and a half now,

644
00:53:05,197 --> 00:53:05,858
They won't have coverage.

645
00:53:05,898 --> 00:53:07,999
If they get it today, they won't have coverage till July.

646
00:53:08,039 --> 00:53:10,320
They'll be out a year and a half of insurance.

647
00:53:12,842 --> 00:53:13,663
It's unacceptable.

648
00:53:14,663 --> 00:53:15,664
Our members deserve better.

649
00:53:16,444 --> 00:53:17,485
The city deserves better.

650
00:53:19,466 --> 00:53:23,029
There should be some kind of proof of insurance when you get hired by the city.

651
00:53:23,309 --> 00:53:26,711
If you're not going to take their insurance, you need to prove that you have insurance.

652
00:53:28,192 --> 00:53:30,253
The state requires it when you file your taxes.

653
00:53:30,994 --> 00:53:32,315
The city doesn't require it when you

654
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:38,455
when you join their health coverage or you opt out of it, they require it.

655
00:53:39,296 --> 00:53:43,179
In order to go for, if you guys know, in the GIC, there's an opt out.

656
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:49,204
We get a benefit of $2,000 for a single, $4,000 for a family.

657
00:53:49,985 --> 00:53:54,368
If you wanna opt out of the insurance, you have to prove that you have insurance.

658
00:53:55,749 --> 00:53:59,392
But if you get hired, you don't have to prove that you're insurance if you don't want it.

659
00:53:59,953 --> 00:54:01,654
So they only care when it costs them money.

660
00:54:01,934 --> 00:54:02,615
You have to prove it.

661
00:54:03,936 --> 00:54:18,731
That tells you the city doesn't care about us, but they only care about money, this, it's a little confused because I know that as as a negotiator on when we were as a teacher, and we negotiate we're one of the first, I believe back in the days, we were on the negotiating team when we were

662
00:54:20,029 --> 00:54:22,650
picking the government insurance process.

663
00:54:22,710 --> 00:54:29,154
And I know that we, that's one of the things with the teachers onboarding system that's done right away.

664
00:54:29,234 --> 00:54:39,740
So I think that that's something this council, I would make an emotion that we ask that we see the onboarding system that's used in practice today.

665
00:54:40,420 --> 00:54:49,822
and our HR department and then review to see how we can correct these issues so we don't have people or families without insurance without knowing.

666
00:54:49,902 --> 00:54:52,443
So I think that'd be important.

667
00:54:52,463 --> 00:54:53,763
I'd make that as a form of motion.

668
00:54:54,404 --> 00:54:58,625
And then I'd also make a form of motion that requests that

669
00:55:00,285 --> 00:55:14,275
that HR director reach out to these three firefighters directly and call for an emergency meeting with them ASAP so we can get that clock started so they're insured through the city as soon as possible.

670
00:55:14,355 --> 00:55:19,399
So again, I don't, I don't, personally, I don't, it's not hearsay.

671
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,301
I've worked with the GIC often.

672
00:55:24,175 --> 00:55:25,956
This is not a year-long process.

673
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:38,161
This is if you go through different benefits departments, they have charts that are set up that shows you if you're hired, and these dates, these are the dates that you'll be on board.

674
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:39,522
They're given, they're,

675
00:55:40,322 --> 00:55:44,744
I'm not going to share with you, but this is one communities that they share with the person that's hired.

676
00:55:45,484 --> 00:55:45,925
This is it.

677
00:55:46,245 --> 00:55:46,925
This is your date.

678
00:55:47,405 --> 00:55:48,326
You're hired in this date.

679
00:55:48,526 --> 00:55:50,547
Expect to have your G. I. C. On this date.

680
00:55:51,007 --> 00:55:55,489
So that's something we need to correct on the city side to make sure this doesn't happen again.

681
00:55:55,569 --> 00:56:01,492
So, um, again, this is this is alarming, but I think it's something we need to correct as soon as possible.

682
00:56:01,532 --> 00:56:04,773
Madam President, any further discussion from counselors?

683
00:56:06,514 --> 00:56:08,435
Any other members of the public would like to speak?

684
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:10,540
I'd like to speak if I may.

685
00:56:10,641 --> 00:56:12,001
Sure, name and address for the record, please.

686
00:56:12,021 --> 00:56:12,801
Paul Jones, 5 St.

687
00:56:12,842 --> 00:56:14,762
Mary Street, treasurer of the union.

688
00:56:16,343 --> 00:56:20,385
At first, I'd like to say that I'm embarrassed that we're here for this issue.

689
00:56:20,885 --> 00:56:30,189
This is a basic employee function, basic employee benefits that should be able to be taken care of routinely on an everyday fashion.

690
00:56:31,490 --> 00:56:37,993
Through the chair, Mr. Osborne, how many times have I been to your office regarding this issue with these firefighters?

691
00:56:40,643 --> 00:56:41,926
Mr. Osborne, would you like to answer that?

692
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:44,912
I don't have an answer for that.

693
00:56:46,058 --> 00:56:46,598
Thank you.

694
00:56:46,638 --> 00:56:48,739
I'll tell you a minimum of six times.

695
00:56:49,539 --> 00:56:50,159
I apologize.

696
00:56:50,219 --> 00:56:52,240
I did not document the times and dates.

697
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:54,840
The last time I was there, we spoke to Candace.

698
00:56:55,620 --> 00:56:56,501
You were in a Zoom meeting.

699
00:56:56,741 --> 00:56:59,381
I asked for her to have you give me a call back.

700
00:56:59,441 --> 00:57:00,562
I'm still waiting for the call.

701
00:57:01,582 --> 00:57:04,803
These firefighters have been to your office numerous times.

702
00:57:05,143 --> 00:57:09,964
There were no misstatements by President Buckley because I was present for most of these meetings.

703
00:57:10,424 --> 00:57:13,965
We have discussed this, as you requested, multiple times.

704
00:57:15,492 --> 00:57:19,233
So for us to have to go there again, we'll do it one more time.

705
00:57:19,373 --> 00:57:20,353
We'll be there tomorrow.

706
00:57:21,733 --> 00:57:22,633
You name a time.

707
00:57:23,533 --> 00:57:30,535
And when we leave your office tomorrow, these three firefighters will have insurance through the GIC, whether you do it or I have to do it myself.

708
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:34,175
I request the paperwork that the GIC requires to sign them up.

709
00:57:36,496 --> 00:57:40,256
So let me rephrase the question, Mr. Osborne.

710
00:57:40,296 --> 00:57:44,097
Have I been to your office regarding this issue with these firefighters?

711
00:57:45,188 --> 00:57:46,729
I mean, this is an interrogation.

712
00:57:46,749 --> 00:57:50,132
I understand your approach, but Mr Osborne, it's not interrogation.

713
00:57:50,172 --> 00:57:50,812
It's a question.

714
00:57:51,793 --> 00:57:53,714
It's happening.

715
00:57:53,894 --> 00:57:54,955
I understand that it's through the chair.

716
00:57:54,975 --> 00:57:56,356
I'm the chair through the chair.

717
00:57:56,456 --> 00:57:59,879
He's saying that President Buckley has made misstatements.

718
00:58:00,479 --> 00:58:01,920
I was present for these events.

719
00:58:02,761 --> 00:58:03,702
They're not misstatements.

720
00:58:05,083 --> 00:58:05,183
It's

721
00:58:07,745 --> 00:58:09,866
I would just like for these firefighters to have insurance.

722
00:58:10,346 --> 00:58:13,087
There are other employees, police, DPW.

723
00:58:13,587 --> 00:58:17,128
This is not an issue that's specific to the fire department.

724
00:58:17,428 --> 00:58:19,069
It's specific to all city employees.

725
00:58:20,529 --> 00:58:21,909
I'd love to get these people covered.

726
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:31,973
And if we were never told about a GIC exclusionary 60 day wait period, we've always been told, fill out the paperwork, we're working on it, we will get back to you.

727
00:58:33,573 --> 00:58:36,154
So that was a misstatement by Mr. Osborne.

728
00:58:37,352 --> 00:58:42,299
I will see you in your office tomorrow now with these three firefighters looking forward to it.

729
00:58:42,539 --> 00:58:43,720
Probably about 10 o'clock.

730
00:58:43,761 --> 00:58:44,341
How's that sound?

731
00:58:45,743 --> 00:58:46,064
Thank you.

732
00:58:46,484 --> 00:58:48,006
Thank you, Madam President.

733
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:50,790
I can just just final question.

734
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:50,890
Um,

735
00:58:53,294 --> 00:59:04,641
I have those motions in place, but if Mr. Osborne can answer, are we having similar issues with fire and DPW as well, and other departments?

736
00:59:04,661 --> 00:59:05,561
Do you mean police and DPW?

737
00:59:05,581 --> 00:59:10,744
Police, excuse me, police and DPW, any other departments that, so we can correct that as well.

738
00:59:10,904 --> 00:59:12,005
Mr. Osborne, can you speak to that?

739
00:59:13,065 --> 00:59:18,208
No employee that's met with us has informed me that they are without insurance.

740
00:59:18,228 --> 00:59:19,569
Okay, thank you.

741
00:59:19,869 --> 00:59:20,110
Thank you.

742
00:59:23,191 --> 00:59:25,453
Any other members of the public wishes?

743
00:59:25,553 --> 00:59:26,373
One more thing on that.

744
00:59:26,454 --> 00:59:29,576
I have spoken to many people that say they have no insurance.

745
00:59:30,457 --> 00:59:33,239
They've been signed up to the connector to the mayor's office.

746
00:59:33,939 --> 00:59:38,963
They've been told to bring their bills to City Hall to pay the bills, which I guess is be self insured.

747
00:59:39,584 --> 00:59:40,885
They were told to go on Cobra.

748
00:59:41,185 --> 00:59:42,886
They were told to go on their parents insurance.

749
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:45,728
They were told to do anything but sign up for the gig.

750
00:59:46,469 --> 00:59:47,390
If it's a gig issue,

751
00:59:48,564 --> 00:59:54,748
We would have liked to known that back in July, not today, but we will take care of this one way or the other.

752
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:56,049
I appreciate your time.

753
00:59:56,710 --> 01:00:03,254
And again, I'm sorry to have to spend it on this issue, which shouldn't have to be rise to this level.

754
01:00:03,995 --> 01:00:04,315
Thank you.

755
01:00:04,575 --> 01:00:04,856
Thank you.

756
01:00:06,377 --> 01:00:12,721
On the emotion of councilor Scarpelli as amended three times by councilor Scarpelli, seconded by councilor Carriello.

757
01:00:12,741 --> 01:00:13,762
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

758
01:00:20,063 --> 01:00:20,183

Madam President, can we take papers?

871
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:54,312
20-024, 23-044, 23-057, and 23-058, please.

872
01:00:54,332 --> 01:00:55,473
Okay, so we're still under suspension.

873
01:00:55,493 --> 01:01:01,218
I don't think we have to vote on that, correct, Mr. Clerk?

874
01:01:01,258 --> 01:01:01,598
All right, so 20-024.

875
01:01:20,438 --> 01:01:22,239
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

876
01:01:22,259 --> 01:01:25,681
20-024 offered by Vice President Behrs.

877
01:01:26,281 --> 01:01:31,904
Medford Affordable Housing Trust, chapter 49, housing, article two, housing stability notice.

878
01:01:32,164 --> 01:01:33,645
President, motion to waive the reading.

879
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:41,669
On the motion of Vice President Behrs to waive the reading in favor of a summary, seconded by Councilor Sang.

880
01:01:42,629 --> 01:01:43,550
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

881
01:01:52,028 --> 01:01:52,328
Yes.

882
01:01:53,829 --> 01:01:55,450
Yes.

883
01:01:55,890 --> 01:01:57,151
Yes.

884
01:02:00,052 --> 01:02:00,352
Yes.

885
01:02:05,535 --> 01:02:06,175
Briefly absent.

886
01:02:07,796 --> 01:02:08,016
Yes.

887
01:02:09,717 --> 01:02:09,937
Yes.

888
01:02:10,177 --> 01:02:14,019
Six in the affirmative zero in the negative one briefly absent.

889
01:02:14,659 --> 01:02:19,862
I'm going to hand it over to vice president bears for a summary of the paper before us.

890
01:02:20,745 --> 01:02:22,606
Thanks, Madam President.

891
01:02:24,686 --> 01:02:33,609
Just a quick summary this is we've discussed this many times now over the past three years and committee and subcommittee This is a proposal to create an affordable housing trust for the city of Medford.

892
01:02:34,109 --> 01:02:37,890
This would create a trust of the provisions of state law where

893
01:02:39,477 --> 01:02:47,361
City funds private funds etc could be pulled for the benefit of creating more affordable housing in the community.

894
01:02:49,082 --> 01:02:52,244
This has been reported out of committee, just the latest updates.

895
01:02:55,410 --> 01:03:00,493
Motion when this is reported on a committee in November was to request comments from Greater Boston Building Trades.

896
01:03:00,633 --> 01:03:06,076
They have submitted a letter of comment through the Greater Boston Labor Council, which was included in our packets last week.

897
01:03:07,997 --> 01:03:14,581
I also have distributed a short, there's two minor technical amendments that need to be made here.

898
01:03:14,621 --> 01:03:23,307
I just caught a couple of typos when I was reading through the, well, caught a couple of typos and a couple of typos were brought to my attention looking through the ordinance on the agenda.

899
01:03:25,094 --> 01:03:27,862
I'm happy to present them, but there's one in section 49-52, which the

900
01:03:32,668 --> 01:03:35,050
Number four should be replaced with the remaining members.

901
01:03:35,090 --> 01:03:39,193
It says the board shall be composed of seven members, but then it says one shall be the mayor.

902
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:41,594
One may be a member of the Community Preservation Committee.

903
01:03:41,614 --> 01:03:48,759
And then it says four, that would only add up to six or maybe even five if the may of the Community Preservation Committee members considered.

904
01:03:48,839 --> 01:03:55,664
So I just proposed a technical amendment to strike the number four and replace it with the words, the remaining members.

905
01:03:57,355 --> 01:04:00,980
And then in section 49-54, subsection 11, just clarifying language here.

906
01:04:07,506 --> 01:04:21,210
that we had put into the ordinance, just to explain that borrowed by the trust shall pledge any borrowing that pledges more than 70% of the cash assets of the trust for Park City Council approvals.

907
01:04:21,930 --> 01:04:24,191
It was just a little bit confusing there.

908
01:04:24,251 --> 01:04:26,972
And I talked that over with planning development and sustainability.

909
01:04:27,552 --> 01:04:31,073
So I would move to amend

910
01:04:33,137 --> 01:04:39,102
the ordinance to reflect those two technical amendments, which all counselors should have and the clerk should have.

911
01:04:40,924 --> 01:04:54,436
And I would also move to attach the letter of comment received from the Greater Boston Labor Council and require the trustees to incorporate the language provided by the Greater Boston Labor Council into the rules and regulations of the Affordable Housing Trust.

912
01:04:55,637 --> 01:05:00,101
And so that would be the language that we received back regarding project labor agreements.

913
01:05:02,163 --> 01:05:04,887
for those folks at home who do not have this in front of them.

914
01:05:04,927 --> 01:05:10,015
Could you please read the amended language for section 49-5411 just so sure it was read.

915
01:05:16,909 --> 01:05:19,650
I know it's just, it's like a conjugation change and insertion of one word.

916
01:05:19,670 --> 01:05:29,454
It clearly reads any borrowing by the trust that pledges, any borrowing by the trust pledging more than 75, 70% of the assets of the trust requires city council approval.

917
01:05:29,934 --> 01:05:36,917
The change would be any borrowing by the trust that pledges more than 70% of the cash assets of the trust requires city council approval.

918
01:05:37,457 --> 01:05:38,498
Great, thank you.

919
01:05:40,999 --> 01:05:43,740
So we have those two amendments by,

920
01:05:45,649 --> 01:05:46,569
Vice President of Affairs.

921
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:49,671
And I would propose those amendments and to approve the ordinance for first reading.

922
01:05:50,631 --> 01:05:51,872
Motion to sever.

923
01:05:51,892 --> 01:05:55,373
I'm sorry, Councilor Knight.

924
01:05:56,134 --> 01:05:57,094
Motion to sever the amendments.

925
01:05:57,654 --> 01:06:00,576
Okay, motion to sever the amendments.

926
01:06:02,837 --> 01:06:05,818
Take the amendments completely separate or just separate from all yet?

927
01:06:06,458 --> 01:06:07,218
Separate.

928
01:06:07,899 --> 01:06:08,459
Just one by one.

929
01:06:08,479 --> 01:06:10,160
Okay, that's fine.

930
01:06:14,594 --> 01:06:15,474
So we have those before us.

931
01:06:15,494 --> 01:06:17,555
I know there's a number of members of the public who would like to speak.

932
01:06:17,575 --> 01:06:19,396
Any councilors who would like to speak at this time?

933
01:06:21,937 --> 01:06:23,198
Councilor Collins and then Councilor Osanic.

934
01:06:25,318 --> 01:06:38,344
Thank you, President Morrell, and thank you, Vice President Behrs for continuing to work with council leadership and city staff to get this ordinance into the version that we're voting on for first reading.

935
01:06:38,962 --> 01:06:44,345
Tonight, another many years of hard work has gone into this ordinance predating my tenure on this council.

936
01:06:45,966 --> 01:06:48,567
I think it's about time in many ways.

937
01:06:48,627 --> 01:06:56,852
This has been a work product spread out over many years with input from many local and regional housing experts.

938
01:06:57,052 --> 01:07:03,636
And what's most important to me is that there is a incredibly demonstrated need for

939
01:07:04,704 --> 01:07:12,989
affordable housing in Medford and mechanisms for creating affordable housing in Medford and repositories for funding for affordable housing in Medford.

940
01:07:13,029 --> 01:07:20,833
There's already a discrepancy between the people who are eligible for affordable or subsidized housing and how much of that type of housing that we already have.

941
01:07:21,434 --> 01:07:27,017
So in a lot of ways, creating an affordable housing trust is really just a preliminary step, but it's one I'm glad we're finally taking.

942
01:07:27,197 --> 01:07:27,477
Thank you.

943
01:07:29,378 --> 01:07:30,099
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

944
01:07:30,139 --> 01:07:30,559
Councilor Sack.

945
01:07:31,118 --> 01:07:32,259
Thank you, President Morrell.

946
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:41,891
This, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund is something that experts and residents have been working on and clamoring for for a very long time in our city.

947
01:07:42,812 --> 01:07:44,894
I've, especially in the last few weeks.

948
01:07:46,596 --> 01:07:59,366
There's been a lot of pressure on us rightfully so to get this done and dusted, and this ordinance, you know, has has been in the works for many years as Councillor Collins has stated.

949
01:08:00,807 --> 01:08:03,089
And it's finally time to do something about it.

950
01:08:03,469 --> 01:08:08,533
I think when we think about the crises that are immediate to our, to our city.

951
01:08:09,534 --> 01:08:21,223
There are many, but housing is first and foremost for many if not for many residents and it touches many if not all of our residents here as a young person who wants to stay in Medford.

952
01:08:22,744 --> 01:08:34,152
This is, you know, the type of action that we need to see our city government investing in doing to make sure that young folks can stay in Medford to make sure that people who want to buy houses can buy houses.

953
01:08:35,513 --> 01:08:39,796
and to really tackle the regional housing crisis challenge.

954
01:08:40,216 --> 01:08:42,458
So I'm happy to support this.

955
01:08:42,898 --> 01:08:56,287
I'm glad that we were able to iron out a lot of the details, and while I think, and we said this last week about the ordinances that we passed last week, you know, there are going to be small things that people want to see changed.

956
01:08:57,548 --> 01:08:58,569
I think this represents

957
01:08:59,369 --> 01:09:15,959
us as a council, listening to the experts, listening to the unions, listening to our stakeholders in this project, really giving them time to work out the kinks and the details, and coming back with a product that I think we can be proud of.

958
01:09:16,599 --> 01:09:17,299
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

959
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:17,880
Councilor Knight.

960
01:09:19,000 --> 01:09:20,141
Madam President, thank you very much.

961
01:09:20,441 --> 01:09:23,563
First of all, I'd like to withdraw my motion to seven amendments.

962
01:09:24,355 --> 01:09:28,522
And second Council business motion to approve the first reading.

963
01:09:29,824 --> 01:09:33,591
After taking a how to look at the amendments that he's made I don't see any reason to seven.

964
01:09:34,555 --> 01:09:42,021
This is something that I think we need to also thank our friend john Falco for because Council Falco was the person that kicked this off.

965
01:09:42,481 --> 01:09:50,967
And this wouldn't have gotten as far as it had if it weren't for john's diligence and john's work on this particular issue when he served as a member of the city council.

966
01:09:51,607 --> 01:09:55,130
So with that being said, Madam President, I support the paper and I thank the gentleman for his amendments.

967
01:09:56,448 --> 01:09:57,109
Thank you, Councilor Nye.

968
01:09:57,789 --> 01:09:58,350
Councilor Kerrio.

969
01:09:58,670 --> 01:09:59,511
Thank you, Madam President.

970
01:09:59,892 --> 01:10:10,282
As I hear from people and I hear from businesses that want to locate into Metro, one of the concerns is if we're going to have enough housing for their employees as they move here.

971
01:10:10,763 --> 01:10:19,712
So I would hope that this ordinance will help alleviate some of those things and hopefully drive some more housing into our market.

972
01:10:20,848 --> 01:10:21,648
Thank you, Councilor Caravaglio.

973
01:10:22,068 --> 01:10:22,728
Back to Councilor Sang.

974
01:10:23,229 --> 01:10:29,170
I think Councilor Caravaglio makes a great point there that pro-housing policies are pro-business and pro-growth as well.

975
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:33,771
And if we wanna see a more vibrant economy, this is the type of stuff we need to be doing.

976
01:10:33,791 --> 01:10:37,272
So I think that's a great point and I just wanted to reinforce it.

977
01:10:38,272 --> 01:10:38,952
Thank you, Councilor Sang.

978
01:10:39,493 --> 01:10:40,053
President Bares.

979
01:10:40,373 --> 01:10:41,213
Thank you, Madam President.

980
01:10:41,273 --> 01:10:47,975
I just wanna second what Councilor Knight said and thanks to former Councilor Falco for advancing this.

981
01:10:48,255 --> 01:10:48,955
When it was first,

982
01:10:50,242 --> 01:10:56,249
On the agenda and I saw my name next to I said that doesn't seem right I don't think I proposed this in January 2020 but that's because counselor talk with it.

983
01:10:56,489 --> 01:10:57,109
So, thank you.

984
01:10:58,391 --> 01:11:08,301
Yeah, and I just, I also want to, I mean, thanks to everyone who worked on this and the council for their support and the many folks who lended their voices to shaping this.

985
01:11:09,528 --> 01:11:12,770
all in City Hall, outside of City Hall, residents, unions, everyone.

986
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:20,055
And I agree that I think actually two recent papers, this paper and the housing civilian notification ordinance were brought to this Council by Councilor Falco.

987
01:11:20,095 --> 01:11:23,438
So I hope he's happy that we are finally finishing some of this work.

988
01:11:24,278 --> 01:11:28,141
I know we do have some members of the public who would like to speak both on Zoom and in person.

989
01:11:28,421 --> 01:11:33,105
I do see one hand up from Matthew Page Lieberman.

990
01:11:34,926 --> 01:11:36,287
Name and address for the record, please.

991
01:11:38,422 --> 01:11:41,223
Yeah, I just want to say, though, that Councilor Knight's hand is still up.

992
01:11:41,543 --> 01:11:42,483
Does he need to speak?

993
01:11:42,643 --> 01:11:43,343
I believe it is.

994
01:11:43,363 --> 01:11:44,824
I believe it's remaining up.

995
01:11:44,924 --> 01:11:48,125
Councilor Knight, tell me if I'm wrong, but I think your hand is just still up.

996
01:11:48,145 --> 01:11:49,285
Or do you have something else you'd like to add?

997
01:11:52,606 --> 01:11:53,666
Don't encourage me, Councilor.

998
01:11:55,327 --> 01:11:56,287
All right.

999
01:11:56,307 --> 01:11:57,508
Great.

1000
01:11:57,908 --> 01:11:58,488
Back to you, Matthew.

1001
01:11:59,122 --> 01:12:01,925
Oh, well, it remains to be up the vestigial hand.

1002
01:12:02,466 --> 01:12:04,328
Yeah, so I mean, this is extremely exciting.

1003
01:12:04,368 --> 01:12:06,630
I know people have been working on for a long time.

1004
01:12:06,690 --> 01:12:12,276
I also believe that, you know, Roberta Cameron played a major role in this, getting this off the ground some years ago.

1005
01:12:12,296 --> 01:12:15,780
You know, it's really, really exciting that's finally getting the vote.

1006
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:21,285
And I know it's been kind of taken a few months, it seems like there was a little bit of deferring.

1007
01:12:21,926 --> 01:12:25,488
to a union to figure out to get their take on the language and stuff like that.

1008
01:12:25,508 --> 01:12:35,074
And so, you know, as of Friday, you know, somebody like me, I'm finally able to see the public copy and the preference for I guess what is the project work agreement.

1009
01:12:35,854 --> 01:12:38,636
It's something that I do not have, I do not have a problem with.

1010
01:12:39,637 --> 01:12:44,202
But, you know, I was not able to attend the committee committee the whole meeting in November.

1011
01:12:44,642 --> 01:12:52,471
And, you know, just based on reading the minutes of that and seeing, you know, this final or prior to the next amendments that we voted on.

1012
01:12:53,396 --> 01:13:13,975
I just kind of noticed that I think when we're, if we're kind of seeing, you know, unions and like high paying jobs as a way of addressing, you know, economic injustice, especially here, like in the greater Boston area, if I mean, if we're going to value the unions and understand the role that, you know, unions have played in the history of this country, moving, you know, people doing working class in a middle class,

1013
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:16,236
building the middle class in this country.

1014
01:13:17,177 --> 01:13:24,441
It's also important to kind of consider that that's not the only part of the picture when we talk about addressing economic injustice.

1015
01:13:25,221 --> 01:13:42,392
You know, for instance, you know, a report came out, it's kind of, it's a little, it's a famous report, some people criticize the numbers and they're trying to reevaluate that, you know, a report came out from the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, which was also conducted by Duke University, and I guess the New School, I'm not quite sure,

1016
01:13:43,332 --> 01:13:49,096
about in 2015 that the average white household wealth for greater Boston is $247.5 thousand.

1017
01:13:49,116 --> 01:13:50,537
The average median household wealth for U.S.

1018
01:13:50,577 --> 01:13:52,498
born black people in Boston is eight dollars.

1019
01:14:00,823 --> 01:14:23,835
So I think these kinds of things are things that we should also kind of consider when we're talking about we're thinking about how we're going to address income in wealth injustice in our housing plans and so you know one of the things that would have been nice to add as a preference is to make sure that these kinds of contracts are going out to working class people of color or that we'll be contracting perhaps we could do this in the guidelines

1020
01:14:24,375 --> 01:14:31,580
contractors that will have some kind of pledge to make sure that they are hiring people that for centuries have been cut out of economic opportunities.

1021
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:41,407
And especially in the municipal level, we have a lot of power as far as whose contracts we can provide to, who we can kind of help out out of situations like $8 an hour in the whole household wealth.

1022
01:14:42,028 --> 01:14:52,115
Another option, another thing though, is I think it would be nice if we also had just a preference for contracting with non-profit housing developers and community development corporations

1023
01:14:52,555 --> 01:14:55,477
That's just something to think about in the future as we go into guidelines.

1024
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:57,438
I'm not calling for any of those amendments at all.

1025
01:14:57,638 --> 01:15:06,724
I'm extremely, extremely happy this is finally going to get a vote, but I'm just thinking perhaps in the future as we move forward, we can make sure to include those concerns in these guidelines.

1026
01:15:07,044 --> 01:15:07,764
And thank you very much.

1027
01:15:07,804 --> 01:15:09,245
I hope everybody's going to vote for this.

1028
01:15:10,866 --> 01:15:11,226
Thank you.

1029
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,888
Going to Penny, name and address for the record, please.

1030
01:15:17,950 --> 01:15:19,131
Oops, sorry, I need to unmute you.

1031
01:15:19,391 --> 01:15:19,952
Sorry, apologies.

1032
01:15:21,633 --> 01:15:21,913
There you go.

1033
01:15:23,254 --> 01:15:24,597
Great, thanks.

1034
01:15:24,938 --> 01:15:27,303
Penny Taylor 29 Martin Street in Medford.

1035
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:34,098
I work as a housing advocate in the city of Somerville and have been organizing against displacement in this area for the past decade.

1036
01:15:34,659 --> 01:15:40,002
In Somerville, the Affordable Housing Trust Fund is a meaningful tool to impact the housing needs of residents.

1037
01:15:40,542 --> 01:15:41,823
The flexibility is key.

1038
01:15:41,943 --> 01:15:48,947
It allows creative solutions to the complicated and varying problems people are facing in our housing crisis.

1039
01:15:49,587 --> 01:15:53,489
And this type of fund allows for clear material advantages for residents.

1040
01:15:54,062 --> 01:16:03,212
especially those who have the most barriers to reaching other forms of support and housing stability alongside benefiting truly all residents, renters and owners alike.

1041
01:16:03,392 --> 01:16:06,735
So I'm excited to see it happening here in Medford and hope you all approve it.

1042
01:16:06,755 --> 01:16:07,296
Thank you so much.

1043
01:16:07,316 --> 01:16:09,098
Thank you.

1044
01:16:11,057 --> 01:16:12,158
We'll go to one person.

1045
01:16:12,938 --> 01:16:14,099
Will, name and address for the record, please.

1046
01:16:14,480 --> 01:16:18,684
William Navarro, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1047
01:16:19,724 --> 01:16:22,047
I just want to say that I think this is a good ordinance.

1048
01:16:22,487 --> 01:16:23,368
You should pass it.

1049
01:16:24,209 --> 01:16:28,132
I'm pleased to see that there's a lot of support of the council for it.

1050
01:16:29,593 --> 01:16:32,996
I also just want to say that a lot of work went in to

1051
01:16:35,640 --> 01:16:41,664
know, reaching a, you know, pro-labor, pro-union version of this ordinance.

1052
01:16:42,425 --> 01:16:47,208
And I think it's important that we recognize that and how we were able to do that.

1053
01:16:47,748 --> 01:16:48,729
The Council was able to do that.

1054
01:16:48,749 --> 01:16:50,831
I think the Vice President took the lead on that.

1055
01:16:51,871 --> 01:16:54,113
And I want to thank him and the Council for doing that.

1056
01:16:57,256 --> 01:17:01,599
And I think Councilor Nye also pushed for that very strongly.

1057
01:17:02,460 --> 01:17:10,245
And I think it's very important that we recognize that as we try to build more housing in the city, there are going to be workers who do that.

1058
01:17:10,926 --> 01:17:16,189
And the workers movement, the union movement is going to be a part of the pro-housing movement.

1059
01:17:16,330 --> 01:17:16,930
It needs to be.

1060
01:17:17,490 --> 01:17:23,354
And so I'm glad that everybody was able to come to a really workable solution.

1061
01:17:24,595 --> 01:17:24,955
on that.

1062
01:17:25,456 --> 01:17:26,537
I know it took some time.

1063
01:17:27,978 --> 01:17:34,262
Everybody would love negotiations and discussions and so I had to go quicker, but it takes time.

1064
01:17:35,083 --> 01:17:39,686
And well, we got to this point and that's really great.

1065
01:17:40,006 --> 01:17:43,589
And I'm excited that this ordinance seems like it's going to pass.

1066
01:17:43,649 --> 01:17:44,009
Thank you.

1067
01:17:44,509 --> 01:17:44,830
Thank you.

1068
01:17:45,951 --> 01:17:48,032
Going to Alex on Zoom.

1069
01:17:48,512 --> 01:17:50,454
Alex name and address for the record, please.

1070
01:17:51,479 --> 01:17:54,221
Hi, my name is Alex Lessenhop, 30 Wright Ave.

1071
01:17:54,421 --> 01:17:54,922
in Medford.

1072
01:17:56,043 --> 01:18:03,149
I have nothing of great, you know, import to say beyond what my fellow residents have already contributed.

1073
01:18:03,169 --> 01:18:08,573
I just want to add my voice to the chorus to say thank you to the Council for working on this.

1074
01:18:08,653 --> 01:18:09,674
Thank you for bringing it forward.

1075
01:18:09,714 --> 01:18:12,116
It sounds like there's support for it.

1076
01:18:12,216 --> 01:18:13,818
I'm really happy to see it finally get passed.

1077
01:18:14,518 --> 01:18:18,841
I work with a volunteer residence group called Housing Medford.

1078
01:18:19,021 --> 01:18:23,984
Passing this affordable housing trust has been one of our top priorities for the past couple of years.

1079
01:18:24,144 --> 01:18:30,048
And I'm really, really excited to, if this indeed passes, to move it into the done column.

1080
01:18:30,449 --> 01:18:31,689
So thank you so much for your support.

1081
01:18:31,809 --> 01:18:32,690
I really appreciate it.

1082
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:36,052
And the people of Medford, current and future residents, all thank you for it.

1083
01:18:36,072 --> 01:18:39,174
Thank you.

1084
01:18:43,632 --> 01:18:44,733
Name and address for the record, please.

1085
01:18:45,393 --> 01:18:47,594
Roberta Cameron, 12 North Street.

1086
01:18:48,174 --> 01:18:50,055
And I just have to come up.

1087
01:18:50,095 --> 01:19:02,742
I don't have anything more to say that hasn't been said already this evening, but I'm really excited that we've all come this far in developing this ordinance to establish the Affordable Housing Trust.

1088
01:19:03,182 --> 01:19:08,364
As was mentioned earlier, I've been working on this for years since we adopted the Community Preservation Act.

1089
01:19:08,725 --> 01:19:13,267
I've been looking at an affordable housing trust as a tool that would be really helpful to

1090
01:19:13,847 --> 01:19:19,730
be able to best use and amplify our Community Preservation Act funds to create affordable housing.

1091
01:19:20,330 --> 01:19:36,979
There's been a lot of concern about the details of exactly what we do with affordable housing trust funds, and I look forward to seeing what kinds of guidelines can be worked out in implementing the affordable housing trust that

1092
01:19:37,879 --> 01:19:49,883
that adopts the preferences and goals of Medford while still centering the primary purpose of the Affordable Housing Trust to create affordable housing.

1093
01:19:50,444 --> 01:19:51,604
So thank you very much.

1094
01:19:52,564 --> 01:19:55,225
And I look forward to the next steps.

1095
01:19:55,745 --> 01:19:55,986
Thanks.

1096
01:19:56,266 --> 01:19:56,606
Thank you.

1097
01:19:57,526 --> 01:20:00,567
Going to PDS Director Alicia Hunt on Zoom.

1098
01:20:01,748 --> 01:20:02,448
I will unmute you.

1099
01:20:06,249 --> 01:20:13,991
Madam President and members of the council, we just wanted to thank you on behalf of our office and the administration for moving this forward.

1100
01:20:14,031 --> 01:20:22,193
We've enjoyed working with you on this ordinance and we look forward, I'm here with Danielle Evans as well from our office.

1101
01:20:23,093 --> 01:20:28,234
We look forward to seeing this passed and working on the implementation of this.

1102
01:20:28,774 --> 01:20:34,736
If anybody's wondering about next steps, we're assuming that we will move forward the work

1103
01:20:37,369 --> 01:20:37,649
very much.

1104
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:39,271
Thank you.

1105
01:20:40,031 --> 01:20:43,955
Going to Dan on zoom, name and address for the record, please.

1106
01:20:45,496 --> 01:20:47,658
Daniel Craven 21 Maple Ave, Medford.

1107
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:55,605
I just have a question on will these properties that are absorbed into this housing trust?

1108
01:20:55,745 --> 01:20:58,327
Will they still pay property taxes to the city of Medford?

1109
01:21:01,038 --> 01:21:07,282
Yeah, well, the properties that go through the housing trust, they'll still pay property taxes.

1110
01:21:07,762 --> 01:21:11,925
I mean, that's a complicated question.

1111
01:21:11,945 --> 01:21:13,546
The housing trust can do a lot of things.

1112
01:21:13,606 --> 01:21:20,531
If the housing trust funds a private project on private land, then that project would pay property taxes.

1113
01:21:21,772 --> 01:21:31,241
The fund was, you know, there could be a complicated arrangement where perhaps the city is leasing public land to a private developer I believe that would also constitute paying property taxes.

1114
01:21:35,185 --> 01:21:53,099
If the city were to say have a piece of land that's currently public land that currently doesn't pay property taxes, because the city would just be paying taxes to itself, and that were to be conveyed to the Affordable Housing Trust, it wouldn't start paying property taxes until it was conveyed to sold or something like that.

1115
01:21:53,239 --> 01:21:55,161
But I don't know if that answers your question.

1116
01:21:55,741 --> 01:22:03,227
It's not so simple as a yes or no answer, but if funding for this goes to private projects, then those would pay property taxes, absolutely.

1117
01:22:04,963 --> 01:22:05,304
Thank you.

1118
01:22:06,286 --> 01:22:06,566
Thank you.

1119
01:22:07,608 --> 01:22:11,516
Any other members of the public wish to speak either on zoom or in person?

1120
01:22:20,700 --> 01:22:25,022
next to doing everything written on here, I don't know why.

1121
01:22:27,243 --> 01:22:28,363
It's in my hand when I stood up.

1122
01:22:28,844 --> 01:22:31,325
Mark Curtis, 89 Chain Craft Street in Medford.

1123
01:22:32,225 --> 01:22:44,651
I just want to say how excited we are as a community, those of us involved in housing Medford, to have this new tool that will be available.

1124
01:22:46,075 --> 01:22:53,601
We already have some very helpful tools in Medford, including the CPA funds, which are making a real difference.

1125
01:22:54,101 --> 01:23:06,570
The Affordable Housing Trust is gonna give us more opportunity to bring additional funding, additional resources, land, more opportunities to build and preserve affordable housing.

1126
01:23:07,070 --> 01:23:14,256
So I just wanna add my thanks and congratulations for all the work that so many people have done over

1127
01:23:16,737 --> 01:23:17,778
this past several years.

1128
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:18,899
So thank you.

1129
01:23:18,959 --> 01:23:19,339
Thank you.

1130
01:23:19,359 --> 01:23:22,401
And I remember talking with you about this at your house when I was door knocking.

1131
01:23:22,441 --> 01:23:23,341
That's exactly right.

1132
01:23:23,701 --> 01:23:23,922
Yes.

1133
01:23:24,402 --> 01:23:25,202
Glad we could deliver.

1134
01:23:26,383 --> 01:23:27,144
But we haven't voted yet.

1135
01:23:27,864 --> 01:23:32,507
Any further discussion from members of the public or any counselors who wish to speak at this time?

1136
01:23:34,408 --> 01:23:44,274
So on the motion of Vice President Behrs as amended by Vice President Behrs to adopt the amendments and approve for first reading as seconded by Councilor Knight,

1137
01:23:45,954 --> 01:23:47,515
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll when you're ready.

1138
01:23:50,576 --> 01:23:53,538
I think Councilor Niestle you're second I apologize.

1139
01:23:53,858 --> 01:23:54,418
Yes.

1140
01:23:55,339 --> 01:23:55,719
Yes.

1141
01:23:55,779 --> 01:23:55,919
Yes.

1142
01:24:14,413 --> 01:24:19,317
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes, the paper is approved for first reading.

1143
01:24:21,158 --> 01:24:24,060
Okay, he gave me some other paper numbers, I'm gonna find where I wrote them down.

1144
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:26,282
23-044 is, okay.

1145
01:24:26,302 --> 01:24:27,103
Okay, great, thank you.

1146
01:24:36,015 --> 01:24:43,560
Communications from the Mayor, 23-044 to Honorable President Morrell and members of the Medford City Council regarding loan order sidewalk construction and equipment bonds.

1147
01:24:43,660 --> 01:24:53,946
Dear President Morrell and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following loan order, City of Medford loan order sidewalk construction and equipment bonds.

1148
01:24:54,586 --> 01:25:03,532
Be it ordered that $1,500,000 is appropriate for the purpose of constructing and reconstructing sidewalks and acquiring a sidewalk grinder, asphalt pathing equipment,

1149
01:25:03,865 --> 01:25:22,129
It's called spread, including all costs incidental and thereto, and that to meet this appropriation, the treasurer, with the approval of the mayor, is authorized to borrow a set amount pursuant to Chapter 44, Section 7.1 of the General Laws, or pursuant to issue bonds or notes of the city, therefore.

1150
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:48,371
And for the order the author is authorized to file an application with the appropriate officials of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, the Commonwealth quote Commonwealth to qualify under chapter 44A of the general laws and any and all bonds of the city authorized to be borrowed pursuant to this loan order and provide such information and execute such documents as such officials of the Commonwealth may require in connection there with respectfully submitted Brianna Lungo, current mayor.

1151
01:25:48,711 --> 01:25:50,793
And I do believe we have DBW commissioner

1152
01:25:51,597 --> 01:25:52,497
Tim McGivern to speak.

1153
01:25:52,537 --> 01:25:54,758
I also see Councilor Knight with his hand up.

1154
01:25:55,898 --> 01:25:58,239
Councilor Knight, do you want to speak now or wait to hear from Commissioner McGivern?

1155
01:25:58,979 --> 01:26:00,379
I'd love to speak, Madam President.

1156
01:26:01,540 --> 01:26:03,500
Please go ahead.

1157
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:08,421
The paper before us is a paper where I question whether or not it's in proper form.

1158
01:26:09,802 --> 01:26:18,284
If we look at the Memphis City Council rules, Rule 30 will read that every order before a bond issue shall

1159
01:26:19,068 --> 01:26:27,770
before its passage be referred to the city solicitor, who shall forthwith examine the same as to its legality and notify the council in writing of its findings.

1160
01:26:29,391 --> 01:26:34,192
The city solicitor is a position established by ordinance, Madam President.

1161
01:26:34,732 --> 01:26:36,632
Section 2-651, city solicitor.

1162
01:26:37,052 --> 01:26:38,733
There shall be a city solicitor.

1163
01:26:39,373 --> 01:26:39,913
We don't have one.

1164
01:26:41,193 --> 01:26:47,275
Section 2-654, duties to legal instruments of the city solicitor.

1165
01:26:48,112 --> 01:26:55,559
The city solicitor shall advise and cause to be drafted bonds and other legal instruments of whatever as required by the mayor or the council.

1166
01:26:56,179 --> 01:27:00,663
Again, the city solicitor did not draft this paper because we do not have one.

1167
01:27:02,425 --> 01:27:06,848
KP law is time and time again, confirm that they are not the city's attorney.

1168
01:27:07,329 --> 01:27:09,171
They are the mayor's private legal counsel.

1169
01:27:10,512 --> 01:27:13,935
Their client is the mayor, no more, no less.

1170
01:27:14,841 --> 01:27:23,083
I question as to whether or not this paper meets the legal standard of merit and would move to have it sent to the Office of the Attorney General for an independent review.

1171
01:27:27,084 --> 01:27:27,804
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1172
01:27:29,184 --> 01:27:32,785
Any further discussion from the Council before we hear from Commissioner McPherson?

1173
01:27:32,805 --> 01:27:34,385
Councilor Scarpallo.

1174
01:27:35,065 --> 01:27:36,566
I thank you, Madam President.

1175
01:27:37,586 --> 01:27:42,507
I, too, expressed concern early in the whole meeting.

1176
01:27:45,014 --> 01:27:47,569
with no outlook.

1177
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:52,993
or vision of our finances, I find it very difficult to support any paper.

1178
01:27:53,713 --> 01:28:08,182
And I know I appreciate all the work that Tim you're doing and your other department heads, but I hope you can understand that as a city councilor that doesn't know the financial climate of our community.

1179
01:28:08,922 --> 01:28:11,163
And then being given a paper $1.5 million to bond to me is very, very,

1180
01:28:18,728 --> 01:28:21,229
unacceptable, to say the least.

1181
01:28:21,309 --> 01:28:39,234
I think that the other piece that I found alarming is that when we're looking at sidewalk repairs, we've also asked for an update to what the last 1.5 million that I balked at, if we all recall, that we all approved that because we needed it.

1182
01:28:39,954 --> 01:28:44,175
And to be honest with you, I don't see much work going on on sidewalks.

1183
01:28:46,267 --> 01:28:54,724
and we've asked for a report of an update and we haven't gotten that either unless I missed that but I haven't gotten an update with that so I

1184
01:28:56,294 --> 01:29:25,772
I would move to table this until both Councilor Knight's feedback is responded, his motion responded, and we get the update on where that money went for the last one and a half million dollars that we bonded for sidewalk repair, replacement, and stump removal, because I'm still getting a lot of phone calls that sidewalks are a mess, and I haven't seen that list that we've asked for.

1185
01:29:26,866 --> 01:29:30,469
So, I apologize, but that's how I feel.

1186
01:29:32,651 --> 01:29:33,451
Thank you, Councilor Scarbelli.

1187
01:29:33,511 --> 01:29:38,575
Councilor Scarbelli asked a question that I brought up in a motion a few months ago.

1188
01:29:40,136 --> 01:29:42,678
Where are we at with the money that we allocated last year?

1189
01:29:44,159 --> 01:29:45,501
Do you know where we at, Senator?

1190
01:29:47,473 --> 01:29:49,894
Thank you very much.

1191
01:29:50,114 --> 01:29:52,456
Thank you very much, Madam President.

1192
01:29:53,437 --> 01:29:58,521
I mean, I know that we have a contract open and we started that we did get a late start on last year's round.

1193
01:29:59,101 --> 01:30:03,024
But I think as the council knows, we do request an amount of money every year.

1194
01:30:03,044 --> 01:30:09,129
And this time we're including some equipment as part of my strategy to move some of this in house.

1195
01:30:10,109 --> 01:30:12,531
We do have a lot of sidewalk work to do.

1196
01:30:12,691 --> 01:30:14,933
And we also have, I think we have about

1197
01:30:16,511 --> 01:30:27,441
Let's see, $300,000 or $400,000 worth of stump and sidewalk contract that we did last season.

1198
01:30:28,222 --> 01:30:36,189
We still have about $300,000 or so worth of stumps to do, and we have a bunch of the sidewalk to do.

1199
01:30:36,309 --> 01:30:36,970
And then this would be

1200
01:30:37,455 --> 01:30:38,216
basically next.

1201
01:30:39,557 --> 01:30:44,601
Probably one of the reasons why it hasn't been seen is because we have so much sidewalk, so much sidewalk work to do.

1202
01:30:45,802 --> 01:30:52,368
Doing half a million or a million dollars every year of spot repairs hasn't really been a good use of money, in my opinion, in the past.

1203
01:30:53,148 --> 01:30:54,990
Owen and I are working on a much different strategy.

1204
01:30:55,030 --> 01:30:58,173
It started before Owen began, looking at it from a

1205
01:31:01,722 --> 01:31:08,188
how often are the sidewalks used, so foot traffic, criticality, what are they located near hospitals, schools, things like that.

1206
01:31:08,769 --> 01:31:13,313
We had all of our sidewalks evaluated for obstructions and whether or not it's to code.

1207
01:31:13,353 --> 01:31:16,556
So we have an incredible amount of data, which we haven't had in previous years.

1208
01:31:16,996 --> 01:31:22,341
So the last round of sidewalk work and then this round of sidewalk work is really focusing on

1209
01:31:23,342 --> 01:31:30,731
the data, so the hotspots, we call them, and then grouping work so it's not spot repair, so it's efficient.

1210
01:31:30,831 --> 01:31:37,018
So production work as opposed to spot repair work, we could probably get twice as much done for the dollar.

1211
01:31:37,439 --> 01:31:38,560
So that's really our strategy here.

1212
01:31:38,580 --> 01:31:40,042
$1.5 million, that would include about

1213
01:31:43,376 --> 01:31:47,079
you know, $350,000, maybe $400,000 worth of equipment.

1214
01:31:47,359 --> 01:31:49,541
So we're working on actually getting that quoted now.

1215
01:31:49,881 --> 01:31:56,766
So that would give us a sidewalk grinder in-house so we can take care of two-inch obstructions easily in-house, so we don't have to replace the whole panel.

1216
01:31:57,767 --> 01:32:01,390
That will empower in-house work to satisfy a lot of our requests.

1217
01:32:02,130 --> 01:32:03,652
And then also patching equipment.

1218
01:32:04,092 --> 01:32:13,120
So I'm trying to get us to move or transition from pothole work to hot patch work.

1219
01:32:14,361 --> 01:32:22,168
Because as we move on in the years here, more of our spider cracking is going to open up to potholes, especially with these freeze-thaw cycles.

1220
01:32:22,888 --> 01:32:29,214
So getting our crew up to speed with hot patch repair is a critical part of that.

1221
01:32:30,275 --> 01:32:32,396
And then the sidewalk grinding is a critical part of that.

1222
01:32:32,456 --> 01:32:35,479
So that's the package in front of you at the moment.

1223
01:32:35,499 --> 01:32:39,002
We're happy, you know, we understand that loans take readings and things like that.

1224
01:32:39,082 --> 01:32:43,365
So, you know, Owen and I are happy to provide the council with whatever information is needed.

1225
01:32:43,425 --> 01:32:52,793
I do believe, and Owen can correct me if I'm wrong, I do believe we have reported to the mayor the status of all the open contracts up until this moment.

1226
01:32:52,853 --> 01:32:56,196
So to prepare us for going into the next construction season.

1227
01:32:56,896 --> 01:33:01,157
So if that information hasn't made it to this council yet, I imagine that it's on its way, and I don't know why it hasn't.

1228
01:33:01,758 --> 01:33:01,918
So.

1229
01:33:02,158 --> 01:33:08,660
So, as we're doing the sidewalk, so are we making base handicap accessible also, if need be?

1230
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:09,740
If need be, yeah.

1231
01:33:09,780 --> 01:33:12,080
And so that's one of the focuses that we have, yeah.

1232
01:33:12,581 --> 01:33:23,704
And I am glad that, you know, you are purchasing some equipment, but as Councilor Scott Pele and I brought up many, many times, so this is $2 million in two years.

1233
01:33:25,370 --> 01:33:31,954
I would like to have seen a sidewalk group doing sidewalks every day here.

1234
01:33:32,354 --> 01:33:33,075
We could get there.

1235
01:33:33,955 --> 01:33:36,657
We can't do it all at once, but I share that vision.

1236
01:33:36,937 --> 01:33:41,120
I think we have enough sidewalk work that we could keep them busy.

1237
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:42,460
Right now,

1238
01:33:44,039 --> 01:33:47,842
You know, that definitely isn't the cause, but this is a first step in that direction.

1239
01:33:48,683 --> 01:33:51,265
We have asphalt and we have sidewalk.

1240
01:33:51,705 --> 01:33:56,989
In my personal opinion, and I think Owen would agree with me, our asphalt is at the priority.

1241
01:33:57,029 --> 01:34:04,355
So we want to get the asphalt equipment first, which is a small spreader, an eight foot spreader, a small grinder, something that we can ride.

1242
01:34:04,375 --> 01:34:05,115
That's for the streets.

1243
01:34:05,135 --> 01:34:06,876
Yes, absolutely.

1244
01:34:06,916 --> 01:34:08,778
And then the sidewalk grinder, which is also part of this.

1245
01:34:09,358 --> 01:34:11,860
I'd say 60, I don't know the exact percentage, 60, 70%.

1246
01:34:13,121 --> 01:34:23,796
some high percentage of sidewalk complaints we receive are two-inch heaps and we put it on a list for a sidewalk contract and we spend, you know,

1247
01:34:26,069 --> 01:34:30,992
three, $4,000 to break the panel out, put a new panel in, and then mobilize to a new location.

1248
01:34:31,692 --> 01:34:34,834
So what I'm trying to do is say, well, no, we can just have our in-house crew.

1249
01:34:34,874 --> 01:34:42,238
And so this is step number one, really, to have an in-house sidewalk crew, to get them used to a grinder machine, and then say, okay, we're used to a grinder machine.

1250
01:34:42,918 --> 01:34:44,339
We already know how to pour panels.

1251
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:47,701
Then it becomes a question of manpower.

1252
01:34:48,121 --> 01:34:53,124
So, and then, you know, in future budgets, you'll see me here presenting for additional manpower.

1253
01:34:53,744 --> 01:34:56,486
Let me see, sidewalk crew is something that I've been looking for.

1254
01:34:56,506 --> 01:34:57,427
Point of information if I can.

1255
01:34:57,567 --> 01:34:58,708
Point of information, Councilor Scarbelli.

1256
01:34:58,868 --> 01:34:59,769
Tim, I appreciate that.

1257
01:35:02,611 --> 01:35:09,396
As one councilor, I stood here in my first budget and asked for a sidewalk hot top crew.

1258
01:35:10,537 --> 01:35:17,302
We worked with the neighboring DPW commissioner that put everything into place, a whole funding mechanism, which isn't a lot of money.

1259
01:35:18,507 --> 01:35:25,515
But the most important thing they said was before we get that equipment, make sure you have enough people that are going to run that equipment.

1260
01:35:25,856 --> 01:35:25,976
Yeah.

1261
01:35:26,476 --> 01:35:30,641
So I think we're putting the cart in front of the horse because I think you're right.

1262
01:35:30,862 --> 01:35:31,663
We need our crew.

1263
01:35:31,683 --> 01:35:34,886
We need this equipment, but we need the crew to do it.

1264
01:35:36,144 --> 01:35:39,107
Right, which is why I don't have a whole slate of sidewalk equipment on here.

1265
01:35:39,228 --> 01:35:51,321
That is why that is the reason why which is why I have one small piece of equipment, because we can we can with our current staffing, we can handle one sidewalk planer, which is what's on there, and we can also what.

1266
01:35:52,422 --> 01:35:53,423
It is, that is an issue.

1267
01:35:53,443 --> 01:35:58,367
So transitioning from hot pothole mix to hot patching is the same crew.

1268
01:35:58,687 --> 01:36:02,870
So instead of two days of potholes, we're going out one day potholes, one day patching.

1269
01:36:03,511 --> 01:36:04,772
I would completely agree.

1270
01:36:04,792 --> 01:36:11,017
You don't want, you can't, we can't, which is why I don't have a 12 foot spreader on here, you know, and a full size spreader.

1271
01:36:11,077 --> 01:36:13,199
I'd like to see a capital plant, to be honest with you.

1272
01:36:13,279 --> 01:36:14,099
These are in there, yeah.

1273
01:36:15,200 --> 01:36:15,721
We have a plan.

1274
01:36:15,761 --> 01:36:16,502
We have a capital plan.

1275
01:36:16,742 --> 01:36:18,024
I submitted a request.

1276
01:36:18,084 --> 01:36:19,665
I know the mayor's office.

1277
01:36:19,726 --> 01:36:20,106
That's good.

1278
01:36:20,186 --> 01:36:25,592
So the whole idea is that truck and the equipment needed with three staff members.

1279
01:36:25,773 --> 01:36:29,977
It wasn't a lot of money considering what we've been putting in for bonds over the last four or five years.

1280
01:36:30,698 --> 01:36:31,819
It really pays for itself.

1281
01:36:31,839 --> 01:36:33,400
So I applaud your effort.

1282
01:36:33,700 --> 01:36:33,940
Thank you.

1283
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:35,861
And we can't pay obviously pay for personnel.

1284
01:36:35,941 --> 01:36:36,702
No, we know, we know.

1285
01:36:37,262 --> 01:36:39,104
So this is a step in together.

1286
01:36:39,364 --> 01:36:57,676
And I will say to there's enough work in the city that we both we need to think about this strategically, it needs to happen, a portion in house and a portion out house, the portion out house, we have a pretty good handle on the portion in house, as we all know, we have obviously some fiscal issues that we're trying to figure out and work through.

1287
01:36:58,356 --> 01:37:08,097
figure out how to best find that and the strategy piece is on my plate to present a strategy so i've been doing i appreciate that it's on the radar now so thank you absolutely absolutely so anyway so jim

1288
01:37:09,201 --> 01:37:10,462
getting off the side, which is a little speck.

1289
01:37:10,522 --> 01:37:18,768
I don't know, a couple of years ago, myself and Councilor Falco had presented the streets where they grind and pave all the same thing.

1290
01:37:19,228 --> 01:37:20,529
Is that something where we're gonna look into?

1291
01:37:21,069 --> 01:37:22,250
Reclamation of asphalt.

1292
01:37:22,310 --> 01:37:23,471
Yes, yeah.

1293
01:37:23,931 --> 01:37:35,379
I'm not saying for the main streets, but maybe we can get some of the, I know when I had met with them, with Councilor Falco, one of the MMA shows, and they had volunteered to come down and do a couple of streets

1294
01:37:36,139 --> 01:37:37,421
It'd be part of a pilot program.

1295
01:37:37,781 --> 01:37:41,825
Is that something that's being thought of again or is it in your wheelhouse?

1296
01:37:41,985 --> 01:37:43,046
It is in our wheelhouse.

1297
01:37:43,106 --> 01:37:46,229
When that first brought up, when I was city engineer, I did review it.

1298
01:37:46,790 --> 01:37:52,576
I did get an education on it, especially with recycled content and asphalt life and things like that.

1299
01:37:54,938 --> 01:38:06,184
We have a lot of work to do just with making sure that we're doing maintenance band work, which is things like crack sealing, overlays at the proper time.

1300
01:38:09,264 --> 01:38:15,788
you know, to avoid having to rebuild later on, coordinating with utility companies.

1301
01:38:15,948 --> 01:38:17,549
So we have a whole host of issues.

1302
01:38:17,990 --> 01:38:19,891
And I will say that that's an option.

1303
01:38:20,251 --> 01:38:21,472
I think we're keeping it on the table.

1304
01:38:22,552 --> 01:38:26,615
But it's not something that we have the time and the resources to experiment with at the moment.

1305
01:38:26,995 --> 01:38:31,499
It would require a little bit more oversight, making sure that it's happening exactly to spec.

1306
01:38:31,699 --> 01:38:34,741
It would be like a special project with the pilot.

1307
01:38:36,202 --> 01:38:46,931
The DPW now in engineering, my focus was just getting us riding the bike before we start doing tricks, if I could put it that way.

1308
01:38:47,732 --> 01:38:49,513
Thank you.

1309
01:38:49,933 --> 01:38:50,694
That's embarrassing.

1310
01:38:53,601 --> 01:38:58,005
BMX guy, maybe I like analogies and things like that.

1311
01:38:58,025 --> 01:38:58,766
So hopefully,

1312
01:39:02,165 --> 01:39:04,026
Just two questions.

1313
01:39:05,006 --> 01:39:06,207
Well, one comment, one question.

1314
01:39:06,227 --> 01:39:11,769
One, I was talking to Steve today, the other day, and he seemed pretty excited about some of the new equipment.

1315
01:39:12,169 --> 01:39:13,750
So that was a good sign.

1316
01:39:15,491 --> 01:39:30,337
Second piece, just to kind of contextualize this, and just let me know if I'm getting it wrong, the assessment that we did, what, two fiscal years ago now, almost three fiscal years ago now, the sidewalk scope alone was 25, 30 million, right, to get to a state of good repair, maybe even more than that.

1317
01:39:30,997 --> 01:39:33,559
Yeah, it's a year in the ballpark.

1318
01:39:33,659 --> 01:39:41,045
Okay, so I just wanted to put that out there that, you know, 1.5 million or, you know, to 1.5 million may sound like a lot but it's

1319
01:39:43,345 --> 01:39:44,625
10% of what our need is.

1320
01:39:45,025 --> 01:39:45,165
Right.

1321
01:39:45,185 --> 01:39:46,326
And that's why it's hard to see too.

1322
01:39:46,806 --> 01:39:48,547
Yeah, we believe me, we're out there.

1323
01:39:48,567 --> 01:39:50,488
We're paying the bills and doing the inspections.

1324
01:39:50,928 --> 01:39:53,770
But just it is hard to see because it is a drop in bucket.

1325
01:39:54,210 --> 01:39:55,390
Yeah, exactly.

1326
01:39:55,510 --> 01:40:02,214
And kind of just want to again confirm here is when you're talking about, you know, that reflects the revenue issue and the funding issue.

1327
01:40:02,714 --> 01:40:06,176
You know, we need more people we need more equipment we need to really get at it.

1328
01:40:06,776 --> 01:40:06,936
But

1329
01:40:07,756 --> 01:40:17,402
The strategy you're talking about just to inform that a little bit more that's also coming partially from the sidewalk assessment of the street assessment as well as some additional research that you've done.

1330
01:40:18,487 --> 01:40:35,902
Yeah the strategy is mostly based off of our assessments and then of course a part of strategy is what do we have for resources, what can we do now, what can we do in year one, what needs to be in year two, what does the capital plan look like and all that so many moving pieces.

1331
01:40:36,262 --> 01:40:39,125
And I don't want to reiterate something you already said but I just want to

1332
01:40:39,932 --> 01:40:41,253
make sure I'm understanding it right.

1333
01:40:41,333 --> 01:40:48,740
Basically what you're trying to do is pivot resources so that smaller things that we can address in-house, we have the tools and the capacity to do that.

1334
01:40:49,020 --> 01:40:56,747
And then for the bigger projects, we're focusing on the areas that are most trafficked, where the sidewalks are most used in the city.

1335
01:40:57,688 --> 01:40:59,749
I would say both of those characterizations are correct.

1336
01:40:59,950 --> 01:41:00,850
Okay, great.

1337
01:41:01,511 --> 01:41:03,273
So I think that really shows that

1338
01:41:05,325 --> 01:41:12,714
To me, something we always talk about is making sure that given the fact that we have limited resources and a lot of need, we're best using the resources that we currently have.

1339
01:41:13,235 --> 01:41:18,942
And it seems to me that that's what your departments are really doing with this situation and what you're asking us for.

1340
01:41:20,504 --> 01:41:23,968
Obviously, we have a lot more that needs to be done, but it does seem to be that.

1341
01:41:25,069 --> 01:41:37,995
you are trying to acquire the equipment and, you know, put forward the contracts where we can address issues as they happen and address the areas of the city that need help the most.

1342
01:41:38,716 --> 01:41:39,496
So that's a comment.

1343
01:41:39,516 --> 01:41:40,336
You don't have to respond to that.

1344
01:41:40,576 --> 01:41:41,457
Thank you, Madam President.

1345
01:41:41,597 --> 01:41:44,258
Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

1346
01:41:44,418 --> 01:41:50,881
I know the Councilor Knight has a motion, I believe, that I seconded, but I just wanted to make sure that

1347
01:41:52,691 --> 01:41:53,712
Tim, it's nothing against you.

1348
01:41:53,732 --> 01:41:55,153
I appreciate the hard work you're doing.

1349
01:41:55,653 --> 01:42:06,262
But again, I think that to my fellow colleagues that we look at the lack of financial transparency and not understanding who we are right now.

1350
01:42:07,243 --> 01:42:15,809
I think to vote for any money paper right now would be a huge detriment as we move forward.

1351
01:42:19,735 --> 01:42:46,581
I'm only going to bring this up a thousand times tonight because I think it's important that we're going to get to May and I don't want to say I told you so because the fact that we don't know where we are financially and it's premature to be bringing money papers to this council and asking for things that might end up having a bond for new equipment but the possibility of hiring

1352
01:42:47,583 --> 01:42:52,466
isn't even on the radar, looking at possible cuts is what I'm afraid of.

1353
01:42:53,947 --> 01:43:12,439
This is what, until we get a clear fiscal vision of where we're going and the understanding, I think it would be really, it would be really reckless for this council to be voting for money papers.

1354
01:43:14,011 --> 01:43:31,407
you know, between the lack of legal support that we have, you know, and I think earlier I was so upset because I just keep reading this KP law stuff and all I keep talking to different city solicitors and understanding that every time that phone rings and they pick it up, it's $700 and the clock starts.

1355
01:43:33,709 --> 01:43:37,030
with $700 and we don't know where we are financially.

1356
01:43:37,090 --> 01:43:54,718
So again, I'm going to share this a thousand times and I'm going to sound like a broken record, but I'm going to tell you, I think it's irresponsible for us to vote for money papers until we have the proper legal support and knowledge of our fiscal outlook.

1357
01:43:54,778 --> 01:43:55,978
So thank you.

1358
01:44:00,438 --> 01:44:12,527
Before we go back to President Behrs, Commissioner McGibbon, if we were to table this to get that opinion from the AG, understanding you have contracts open actually from the last bond, would this push back the timing of any work if we were to wait?

1359
01:44:13,147 --> 01:44:15,389
I mean, I hope it wouldn't take us that long to get that opinion.

1360
01:44:17,110 --> 01:44:20,293
We're going to be hitting the streets running this spring.

1361
01:44:21,073 --> 01:44:22,314
So not the sidewalk piece.

1362
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:25,180
equipment piece.

1363
01:44:25,880 --> 01:44:31,322
I just don't know the timelines on that, but it's similar to what Chief Friedman was saying before.

1364
01:44:31,342 --> 01:44:35,843
The equipment backlog and lead time issue is an issue with DPW2.

1365
01:44:37,623 --> 01:44:39,364
So, you know, we're looking at 12 months.

1366
01:44:39,704 --> 01:44:43,105
I know he's looking at, we're looking at like 12 for lead times for vehicles.

1367
01:44:44,085 --> 01:44:48,406
So, but I, you know, to really respond, if this were,

1368
01:44:49,622 --> 01:44:51,443
delayed for a short period of time.

1369
01:44:51,483 --> 01:44:54,803
I don't think it would, you know, be a critical hit.

1370
01:44:55,224 --> 01:44:56,004
Okay, thank you.

1371
01:44:56,024 --> 01:45:00,745
So and then for that equipment piece, we're actually looking at next year, not because of the delay.

1372
01:45:02,026 --> 01:45:04,406
The smaller piece of equipment, we're going to have shortly time.

1373
01:45:04,806 --> 01:45:07,947
Some of the longer stuff, like the spreader, for example, may be a little bit longer.

1374
01:45:07,967 --> 01:45:10,568
Vehicle builds are about 12 months.

1375
01:45:10,588 --> 01:45:14,309
So something smaller could, you know, we could be looking at eight, nine months, something like that.

1376
01:45:14,669 --> 01:45:17,650
But across the board, if it's made of steel, I think it's delayed.

1377
01:45:18,735 --> 01:45:19,315
Okay, thank you.

1378
01:45:19,396 --> 01:45:19,996
Vice President Behrs.

1379
01:45:20,897 --> 01:45:21,777
Thank you, Madam President.

1380
01:45:24,139 --> 01:45:34,728
Yeah, I mean, to the point around delaying this, you know, I'd be comfortable tabling for our one meeting and requesting an opinion from the Attorney General.

1381
01:45:34,748 --> 01:45:40,172
I think the other thing we just need to hear, and again, a lot of this is a communication question, right?

1382
01:45:40,212 --> 01:45:47,678
On the finances, we had what I thought was a good conversation last week with the finance director on the revenue side of finance.

1383
01:45:49,039 --> 01:45:51,941
I think the question obviously is going to be on the expense side of finance.

1384
01:45:51,981 --> 01:46:02,287
And there's, you know, communication that needs to happen there where, you know, we need, they just need to get us information that we need.

1385
01:46:02,307 --> 01:46:11,552
But in any case, I think the communication issue here is to Councilor Knight's point, we have not heard the administration say that KP Law is functioning as the acting city solicitor.

1386
01:46:13,072 --> 01:46:19,451
Now, in all senses of all operations of the city, they are obviously serving as the acting city solicitor.

1387
01:46:22,748 --> 01:46:26,230
I just think we need to get them, somebody from the administration needs to come here and say that.

1388
01:46:26,310 --> 01:46:31,112
So personally, I would feel comfortable tabling this to our next meeting on March 14th.

1389
01:46:32,993 --> 01:46:36,195
If we want to send it to the Attorney General's office for legal review, that's fine with me.

1390
01:46:36,235 --> 01:46:37,515
I mean, Bond Council reviewed this.

1391
01:46:37,575 --> 01:46:42,598
I believe Bond Council, Jay Gonzalez reviewed this, you know, and that's the Bond Council we've always used.

1392
01:46:43,738 --> 01:46:45,319
KP Law obviously wrote this report.

1393
01:46:45,439 --> 01:46:47,300
If they're functioning as the acting city solicitor,

1394
01:46:47,980 --> 01:46:49,662
I think we should just need to know that.

1395
01:46:50,863 --> 01:46:53,005
I hear everyone on the legal question.

1396
01:46:53,306 --> 01:47:03,035
Quite frankly, we held the administration to account to fund an assistant city solicitor and the position still is unfilled.

1397
01:47:03,956 --> 01:47:08,520
Now, we can debate why the position's unfilled, sure.

1398
01:47:09,181 --> 01:47:11,824
But in my view, we won that fight.

1399
01:47:13,325 --> 01:47:16,686
We said we want in-house legal counsel and the budget has in-house legal counsel.

1400
01:47:17,226 --> 01:47:20,348
The question is just bringing the people on in those positions.

1401
01:47:21,748 --> 01:47:25,489
So I just, I hear what everyone's saying.

1402
01:47:25,649 --> 01:47:32,272
If the administration would just say whether or not KP Law is serving as the acting city solicitor, I think that would be helpful communication for us to have.

1403
01:47:33,348 --> 01:47:42,214
and maybe it would change our view and potentially a little bit about who they work for and who they don't work for, because I believe if they are serving as acting city solicitor, they would be working for us too.

1404
01:47:43,615 --> 01:47:47,737
But in any case, I'm happy to support a tabling for one meeting.

1405
01:47:48,578 --> 01:47:58,484
And I would request either request to amend council rights motion or propose a separate motion that we request that the mayor and city administration

1406
01:47:59,945 --> 01:48:05,326
tell the council whether or not KP law is currently serving as the acting city solicitor for the city of Medford.

1407
01:48:05,747 --> 01:48:06,047
Thank you.

1408
01:48:06,907 --> 01:48:09,307
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1409
01:48:09,367 --> 01:48:11,308
To that point, Councilor Benson, thank you very much.

1410
01:48:14,008 --> 01:48:16,689
Can KP law serve as the assistant city solicitor?

1411
01:48:16,709 --> 01:48:24,651
Because based upon the ordinance that this council passed at some point in time, it says there shall be a city solicitor, and there shall also be an assistant.

1412
01:48:24,831 --> 01:48:28,492
And when there is no city solicitor, the assistant shall be appointed solicitor.

1413
01:48:29,235 --> 01:48:30,216
That's what the ordinance says.

1414
01:48:31,497 --> 01:48:44,026
So can the mayor unilaterally hire a law firm to work and be compensated at a rate of pay and a scale of pay far outside the compensation schedule that's established by the ordinance?

1415
01:48:44,767 --> 01:48:45,467
I don't think she can.

1416
01:48:45,748 --> 01:48:50,011
I don't think she can appoint a law firm into a position that's defined by ordinance with a salary attached to it.

1417
01:48:50,925 --> 01:48:53,446
And we have to, at some point, bring this to a head.

1418
01:48:53,947 --> 01:48:58,309
You know, six months ago, seven, eight months ago now, we sat here and we debated a budget.

1419
01:48:58,629 --> 01:49:00,570
And like you said, the mayor said, oh, no problem.

1420
01:49:00,590 --> 01:49:02,311
We're going to have assistant city solicitor for you guys.

1421
01:49:02,331 --> 01:49:02,971
We're going to post it.

1422
01:49:02,991 --> 01:49:04,572
It's going to be an in-house position.

1423
01:49:04,972 --> 01:49:05,693
We still don't have it.

1424
01:49:06,233 --> 01:49:07,013
And we still don't have it.

1425
01:49:07,134 --> 01:49:08,854
That was all smoke to get the budget passed.

1426
01:49:09,335 --> 01:49:13,117
You know, the mayor never had any intention of filling that position because if she did, it would be filled.

1427
01:49:14,057 --> 01:49:16,659
Um, you know, so that's, that's why I raised the issue.

1428
01:49:16,699 --> 01:49:19,400
I mean, we, we have no guidance whatsoever.

1429
01:49:20,345 --> 01:49:25,250
You know, we're like the clown show, you know, we sit here and we talk and we have great ideas.

1430
01:49:25,790 --> 01:49:32,597
And, you know, we want to follow through and we'd be very productive if we had the tools that were necessary to get the job done, but we don't.

1431
01:49:33,458 --> 01:49:40,965
And it's very frustrating to not have those tools, especially when we have such a talented group of people that could do such good work, you know?

1432
01:49:41,486 --> 01:49:43,788
So, you know, it's time we bring this thing to a head.

1433
01:49:45,959 --> 01:49:48,080
does the city of Medford require a city solicitor?

1434
01:49:48,400 --> 01:49:49,340
The ordinance says it does.

1435
01:49:49,860 --> 01:49:50,781
I don't know why there isn't one.

1436
01:49:51,001 --> 01:50:02,704
And if we don't have one, then there's a problem because there hasn't been one for quite a long period of time, which means that we're operating outside the ordinance, outside the defined parameters of how our government's supposed to operate.

1437
01:50:04,825 --> 01:50:08,066
You know, that's like saying there's supposed to be a secretary of state, but we're just not going to have one.

1438
01:50:13,928 --> 01:50:15,049
So that's why I raised it.

1439
01:50:15,830 --> 01:50:20,934
And to the point of the paper before us, I support the paper and its theory.

1440
01:50:21,134 --> 01:50:22,155
We need this equipment.

1441
01:50:22,275 --> 01:50:25,818
We need these jobs to be able to be performed in-house.

1442
01:50:26,018 --> 01:50:26,919
We need to get this done.

1443
01:50:27,439 --> 01:50:30,642
But we also have $700,000 of a $1.5 million appropriation that we made last year that still remains unspent.

1444
01:50:34,365 --> 01:50:39,948
You know, so in that regard, I think that, you know, we're not going to be in that bad of shape to put this off.

1445
01:50:39,969 --> 01:50:40,989
You know, we want to wait a week.

1446
01:50:41,029 --> 01:50:42,650
We're not going to get a response in a week or two weeks.

1447
01:50:42,670 --> 01:50:44,451
We're not going to get a response by March 14th.

1448
01:50:44,551 --> 01:50:52,676
You know, you know, it's going to take at least 30 days to get a legal response from the attorney general's office, you know, but, you know, it has to come to a head at some point.

1449
01:50:52,976 --> 01:50:56,119
You know, when I support the paper that's before us, you know what I mean?

1450
01:50:56,139 --> 01:50:58,521
You look at the capital plan, you know, you see these things in there.

1451
01:50:58,942 --> 01:51:01,184
So it's not something that we haven't planned for.

1452
01:51:01,824 --> 01:51:03,546
You look at the funding sources, that's a little different.

1453
01:51:03,566 --> 01:51:08,350
You know, when you look at the funding sources in the capital plan, most of it says that it's going to be general fund debt.

1454
01:51:08,831 --> 01:51:10,212
It's not going to be something that's borrowed.

1455
01:51:10,632 --> 01:51:13,235
So, you know, that's where in lies the rub.

1456
01:51:13,635 --> 01:51:14,456
But ultimately,

1457
01:51:16,104 --> 01:51:21,485
In theory, it's a good paper, but in terms of process and procedure, this is something that we need to address.

1458
01:51:21,605 --> 01:51:23,625
And I think that this is a way that we can do it.

1459
01:51:23,645 --> 01:51:28,246
Thank you, Councilor.

1460
01:51:28,266 --> 01:51:28,886
Councilor Collins.

1461
01:51:29,806 --> 01:51:35,667
Thank you, President Morrell, and thank you, Tim, for being here and providing helpful context around this paper.

1462
01:51:35,748 --> 01:51:40,028
I think my feelings are similar to Vice President Behrs.

1463
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:43,929
I feel that I would be comfortable going forward with this

1464
01:51:44,807 --> 01:51:45,648
paper this evening.

1465
01:51:45,908 --> 01:51:49,831
I'm comfortable tabling it if we table it to a date certain, March 14th, our next meeting.

1466
01:51:49,851 --> 01:51:57,697
I think this is an issue that we encounter very often as a council.

1467
01:51:57,737 --> 01:52:11,969
I'm very sympathetic to our need to take actions that force action because we haven't had a super consistent track record of seamless collaboration.

1468
01:52:13,658 --> 01:52:27,806
So far, that being said, you know, I feel like I also say this often, there are, you know, I think every individual player has to make decisions about what they're willing to hold up and what they're not willing to see held up.

1469
01:52:28,067 --> 01:52:30,508
And all of these projects, you know, that come before us are important.

1470
01:52:30,528 --> 01:52:38,012
I think it's up to each of us to make our consideration of what we're willing to place on hold in order to try to force another action.

1471
01:52:38,093 --> 01:52:38,773
So I think this is

1472
01:52:39,409 --> 01:52:40,289
a really important paper.

1473
01:52:40,309 --> 01:52:44,431
I know that, you know, sidewalk repair and road repair is an accessibility issue that touches everybody in the community.

1474
01:52:44,451 --> 01:52:46,432
I'm comfortable tabling it for one meeting.

1475
01:52:46,472 --> 01:52:50,153
Beyond that, you know, I think this is really important to make sure that it goes forward.

1476
01:52:50,213 --> 01:53:00,437
And these greater issues of budget and, you know, continuing, I think what we've had are really great first steps recently in greater budget transparency, continuing those.

1477
01:53:00,457 --> 01:53:02,638
I hope that we continue those

1478
01:53:03,379 --> 01:53:24,270
in parallel, and perhaps if we are amending this paper to ask the mayor for a determination on if KP Law is functioning as an acting city solicitor, if we could also perhaps include an update on where we are at with hiring a city solicitor and assistant city solicitor.

1479
01:53:25,110 --> 01:53:26,411
I know that that was in the works.

1480
01:53:26,471 --> 01:53:27,852
I haven't had an update in a while.

1481
01:53:28,492 --> 01:53:31,054
I'm taking it on good faith that that's a real project.

1482
01:53:31,094 --> 01:53:31,774
I believe that it is.

1483
01:53:32,338 --> 01:53:39,562
and I think that we're all incredibly eager to see whether we actually get the opportunity to know when that in-house legal counsel will arrive.

1484
01:53:39,802 --> 01:53:40,082
Thank you.

1485
01:53:41,062 --> 01:53:41,863
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

1486
01:53:41,903 --> 01:53:43,163
Any further discussion for the council?

1487
01:53:44,584 --> 01:53:47,846
Going to public, I see Matthew Paisley-Berman, hand up.

1488
01:53:50,207 --> 01:53:50,727
I'll unmute you.

1489
01:53:50,747 --> 01:53:54,749
I'm sorry, you just need to hit.

1490
01:53:55,310 --> 01:53:56,410
I got it, I got it.

1491
01:53:56,430 --> 01:53:57,671
So I've known Tim for,

1492
01:53:58,752 --> 01:53:59,653
Is there a little echo?

1493
01:53:59,673 --> 01:54:03,636
Okay, I've known Tim for years, many, many years.

1494
01:54:03,956 --> 01:54:08,620
And, you know, Tim and I, we were speaking in I guess it was around September to November 2021.

1495
01:54:08,880 --> 01:54:13,904
And he was telling me about all the work that he's done with, with Brianna or with our mayor.

1496
01:54:14,284 --> 01:54:21,449
and examining all the sidewalks, like every single inch, doing a real audit of the city, figure out all the work that needs to be done.

1497
01:54:21,509 --> 01:54:23,670
So, I mean, I've been extremely excited.

1498
01:54:23,690 --> 01:54:28,594
I think in our city, we're extremely fortunate to have people like Tim heading up departments.

1499
01:54:28,654 --> 01:54:33,097
I guess, I think that was back when it was the DPW and now engineering, I got it mixed up.

1500
01:54:33,157 --> 01:54:33,917
I'm sorry about that, Tim.

1501
01:54:34,358 --> 01:54:36,719
But, you know, I stopped by City Hall yesterday.

1502
01:54:36,759 --> 01:54:37,880
I was talking to a lot of people.

1503
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:39,901
It was a little bit after 4.30.

1504
01:54:39,981 --> 01:54:41,642
I went to stop by Tim's office.

1505
01:54:42,263 --> 01:54:43,504
People were closing up

1506
01:54:44,645 --> 01:54:46,246
And, you know, it was after 430.

1507
01:54:46,467 --> 01:54:51,192
I wasn't able to go in because he's still he's still working after the clock was was over.

1508
01:54:51,212 --> 01:54:52,414
He's still he's still at the job.

1509
01:54:52,834 --> 01:55:00,363
And I really, really hope that he could get the money as soon as he needs as soon as he needs that money to fix up our city, make our city really

1510
01:55:00,803 --> 01:55:01,444
really nice quality.

1511
01:55:01,484 --> 01:55:03,566
I know that there are people here that are on the council.

1512
01:55:03,586 --> 01:55:04,486
They got the reservations.

1513
01:55:04,907 --> 01:55:07,489
It's nothing against him, but they have assorted reasons.

1514
01:55:07,989 --> 01:55:09,871
No K P law touched me in a certain way.

1515
01:55:09,891 --> 01:55:11,713
You know, K P law this capable of that.

1516
01:55:12,433 --> 01:55:19,379
But I mean, I really appreciate what you know, Councilor Collins says and Council bears that perhaps if it's gonna be held up for just one session.

1517
01:55:19,940 --> 01:55:20,520
That's great.

1518
01:55:20,821 --> 01:55:21,301
That's great.

1519
01:55:21,401 --> 01:55:25,405
But let's let's at least give departments the money they need to work for our city.

1520
01:55:25,925 --> 01:55:32,850
But there's an orthogonal issue, and that's this whole KP law, KP law that's going on every session.

1521
01:55:32,910 --> 01:55:36,473
People will say, I'm sorry to repeat myself, but I have to repeat myself one more time.

1522
01:55:37,013 --> 01:55:44,839
And so I start wondering, why is it the council has so much difficulty thinking outside of the box about how to get an answer?

1523
01:55:45,159 --> 01:55:47,681
Because in my experience in this city, when people want to do things,

1524
01:55:48,061 --> 01:55:51,603
They get the answer immediately, even when it's a mayor that's not responsive.

1525
01:55:51,984 --> 01:55:58,908
All it takes is some mobilizing and some people that are leaders that know how to do the mobilizing, and they say, let's get an answer from the mayor.

1526
01:55:59,269 --> 01:56:01,230
I really think it may be time.

1527
01:56:02,213 --> 01:56:07,334
for the council to start thinking outside of the box, how will we get an answer?

1528
01:56:07,735 --> 01:56:18,017
Because if anybody needs my help, just tell me, just tell me, I can call the mayor, what is the answer about KP law and be done with this silly, you know, Benghazi KP law.

1529
01:56:18,057 --> 01:56:20,038
And I'm always wondering where did KP law touch you?

1530
01:56:20,498 --> 01:56:24,919
You know, so just let, let me know if we need to get an answer because there's going on and on and on and on.

1531
01:56:25,619 --> 01:56:27,020
It's holding up the city.

1532
01:56:27,700 --> 01:56:31,421
Oh, madam president.

1533
01:56:34,605 --> 01:56:35,306
Councilor Scarbelli.

1534
01:56:35,446 --> 01:56:36,487
Thank you, Madam President.

1535
01:56:36,527 --> 01:56:38,388
So I appreciate Mr. Lieberman.

1536
01:56:38,448 --> 01:56:43,652
He's been very active and involved in our community, and he makes a lot of sense at times.

1537
01:56:44,153 --> 01:56:55,802
But I think when we're talking about money papers, I think for one, Councilor, KP law is an issue because we've made mistakes because we don't have legal representation supporting this council.

1538
01:56:55,862 --> 01:57:01,747
So we've been left out in the cold on some serious legal issues that cost us a lot of money.

1539
01:57:02,127 --> 01:57:02,587
That's one.

1540
01:57:04,301 --> 01:57:12,924
My respect for Tim and what they're doing, it can't be, it's not questioned.

1541
01:57:13,004 --> 01:57:19,026
He is amazing, what they're doing there is amazing, but the problem we're having is understanding.

1542
01:57:19,126 --> 01:57:25,669
I know we had our financial paperwork here the other day, financial director here, and he presented some sort of paperwork.

1543
01:57:26,089 --> 01:57:30,671
We still don't see where we are financially in our community.

1544
01:57:31,531 --> 01:57:35,133
So bonding and keep spending money, not understanding where we are.

1545
01:57:35,674 --> 01:57:38,516
It sounds great today and I think it's out of the box and let's do it.

1546
01:57:38,536 --> 01:57:39,016
Let's do it.

1547
01:57:39,336 --> 01:57:39,977
And we do it.

1548
01:57:40,397 --> 01:57:42,859
And then we come to me and say, guess what?

1549
01:57:44,229 --> 01:57:47,671
We didn't know the financial outlook, but this is what it is today now.

1550
01:57:48,311 --> 01:57:57,617
We now have to go to Tim and say, Tim, you have that great equipment we just purchased, but now they're gonna turn into planters, because now we have to lay off 10 DPW employees.

1551
01:57:58,077 --> 01:58:02,640
This is my fear of where we were last year, last May and June.

1552
01:58:03,200 --> 01:58:11,445
Don't forget where we were, that at one in the morning, the mayor had to come back from home and try to figure out a way to give us, find us $12 million.

1553
01:58:12,947 --> 01:58:14,087
So that's all I'm saying.

1554
01:58:15,208 --> 01:58:17,369
We know the issues we have in the city.

1555
01:58:17,829 --> 01:58:24,572
We see it every day and we appreciate directors like Tim that are working their tail off and trying to do the best they can.

1556
01:58:25,132 --> 01:58:40,478
But for one council that represents everybody in the city of Medford financially, if we don't see the paperwork in front of us, we don't see the numbers in front of us, no matter what was presented last week, because that's a great start, but it's March.

1557
01:58:42,236 --> 01:58:42,896
It's March.

1558
01:58:44,897 --> 01:58:45,237
Thank you.

1559
01:58:47,458 --> 01:58:48,298
Thank you, Councilor Scarbelli.

1560
01:58:48,318 --> 01:58:50,319
Name and address for the record, please.

1561
01:58:50,339 --> 01:58:53,580
William Navarro, 108 Medford Street, apartment 1B.

1562
01:58:55,800 --> 01:58:59,482
I sort of have a question about the procedure here and all that.

1563
01:59:00,002 --> 01:59:06,904
If city council is unhappy with the notion that under rule 30,

1564
01:59:10,851 --> 01:59:31,040
KP law is they don't want they don't want to acknowledge the fiction that KP law is the city solicitor acting city solicitor, and they want you know a natural person to be to be that city solicitor rule 30 is Council's own rule Council vote to rule this out of order for rule 30, and rather than wait for attorney general, there's rule 30 and then there's a separate ordinance around.

1565
01:59:31,480 --> 01:59:32,941
establishing the position.

1566
01:59:32,981 --> 01:59:34,841
That's a good point.

1567
01:59:35,021 --> 01:59:43,645
So we can strike down rule 30 and that would solve maybe this paper, but it wouldn't, there's another ordinance that I think is worth some of the questions.

1568
01:59:43,665 --> 01:59:46,306
Fair enough, but you can do both too, right?

1569
01:59:46,666 --> 01:59:50,187
I mean, in theory.

1570
01:59:50,307 --> 01:59:54,068
I think we should amend the charter so the council appoints a city solicitor, but that's just my thoughts.

1571
01:59:54,649 --> 01:59:57,290
I mean, let's see what happens first.

1572
02:00:03,463 --> 02:00:17,249
I just say, rather than wait to deal with this paper till you get back from the Attorney General, you could just say, City Council doesn't like this arrangement, we're not doing this, you know, let's get it sorted.

1573
02:00:20,731 --> 02:00:25,353
Right, okay, well that's fair enough to point of information, Madam President.

1574
02:00:27,405 --> 02:00:30,147
We did say that during the budget hearings that we didn't like the setup.

1575
02:00:30,408 --> 02:00:37,033
And that's why we agreed to pass a budget when the mayor said that she was going to provide us with an assistant city solicitor that works in the building for the city council.

1576
02:00:40,676 --> 02:00:40,976
Thank you.

1577
02:00:41,256 --> 02:00:42,237
Thank you.

1578
02:00:42,958 --> 02:00:51,585
Thank you, Madam President, just because I think we have kind of three prongs of things here now on the table and we should move forward as best we can.

1579
02:00:54,984 --> 02:01:03,531
One is Councilor Knight saying that he wants the Attorney General's office to review whether this is acceptable relative to our city ordinances.

1580
02:01:04,371 --> 02:01:13,878
The second is something that I brought up, which is if the mayor could state whether or not in her view, KP Law is functioning as the acting city solicitor for the city of Medford.

1581
02:01:14,659 --> 02:01:22,065
And the third thing Councilor Collins brought up is an update on the hiring process for the city solicitor, the assistant city solicitor.

1582
02:01:23,777 --> 02:01:25,178
Thank you for presenting back promotions.

1583
02:01:25,639 --> 02:01:26,959
I just want to, is that right?

1584
02:01:27,420 --> 02:01:28,120
That is what I have.

1585
02:01:28,140 --> 02:01:34,244
That's what I was going to address.

1586
02:01:34,264 --> 02:01:35,765
Yes.

1587
02:01:35,825 --> 02:01:40,948
I'm just, I'm trying to not, not trying to fill in for you at all.

1588
02:01:41,008 --> 02:01:46,892
Madam president, just, I was just looking up very quickly.

1589
02:01:46,912 --> 02:01:49,634
There's a municipal law bureau at the attorney general's office.

1590
02:01:51,468 --> 02:02:13,746
relative to those ideas, if everyone who proposed those three different ideas would be comfortable, can we move to table this for one meeting till March 14th, request that the city clerk call the Municipal Law Bureau at the Attorney General's office tomorrow or this week and request that review that Councilor Knight asked for, or ask what the process would be for that.

1591
02:02:15,351 --> 02:02:21,192
and then also ask that the administration get back to us in 10 days around my question and Councilor Collins' question.

1592
02:02:21,412 --> 02:02:27,054
And then in two weeks, we will have some sort of response back from the Attorney General.

1593
02:02:27,074 --> 02:02:29,034
It may not be a full response.

1594
02:02:29,094 --> 02:02:34,035
It may say, this is the process you need to go through to get us to do this, or we don't do this, or whatever else it may be.

1595
02:02:34,655 --> 02:02:41,977
But I just wanted to put some timelines and a shock box on the whole thing, because I agree we need the right answer, but I also agree that we should try to move as fast as we can.

1596
02:02:44,455 --> 02:02:47,556
Does that make sense to everybody, the three folks who proposed motions?

1597
02:02:47,696 --> 02:02:49,676
Yeah, I mean, I think Councilor Knight has the original motion.

1598
02:02:49,716 --> 02:02:51,296
I don't think there's debate about the other motions.

1599
02:02:51,356 --> 02:02:57,597
I think Councilor Knight, the proposed changes from Vice President Behrs around the original motion, is that something you'd be amenable to?

1600
02:02:58,478 --> 02:02:59,238
Yeah, it's not a big deal.

1601
02:03:00,178 --> 02:03:00,358
Great.

1602
02:03:01,138 --> 02:03:03,679
I don't think there's any debate around the other motions, so.

1603
02:03:04,739 --> 02:03:07,319
Motion, keep them all together, we can vote them as one package.

1604
02:03:07,339 --> 02:03:11,520
Okay, so we have a motion from Councilor Knight to combine those three motions.

1605
02:03:13,425 --> 02:03:15,006
approval as amended.

1606
02:03:15,106 --> 02:03:15,346
No.

1607
02:03:16,047 --> 02:03:16,907
Okay, so we have.

1608
02:03:18,508 --> 02:03:22,111
We have a motion from Council tonight to combine all three motions as amended.

1609
02:03:22,971 --> 02:03:23,171
Great.

1610
02:03:23,472 --> 02:03:29,656
Everyone understands three motions are before us we have the table to a date certain have the clerk, reach out to the AP.

1611
02:03:30,276 --> 02:03:32,377
We have Collins.

1612
02:03:35,639 --> 02:03:36,640
We're not approving the paper.

1613
02:03:36,780 --> 02:03:40,923
We're tabling and then we have a number of

1614
02:03:41,997 --> 02:03:42,437
motions.

1615
02:03:45,440 --> 02:03:54,389
Councillor Collins is asking for their opinion on whether or not keeping the laws acting as a state solicitor.

1616
02:03:54,929 --> 02:03:55,370
That's you.

1617
02:03:56,070 --> 02:03:57,011
Hiring update.

1618
02:03:57,151 --> 02:03:57,592
Okay.

1619
02:04:07,287 --> 02:04:12,074
So on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Carviello, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1620
02:04:14,137 --> 02:04:16,180
And this is the table and those other actions.

1621
02:04:16,220 --> 02:04:18,503
Table to a date, sir, and the other actions.

1622
02:04:22,709 --> 02:04:24,211
Madam President, we're into suspension.

1623
02:04:25,742 --> 02:04:28,184
We have to vote but go ahead.

1624
02:04:28,204 --> 02:04:44,694
We also have paper 23057 which is really similar subject matter, and that circumstance we had an opinion from the acting city solicitor at the time was in house in our city solicitor will give us an opinion relative to the way that these promotional advancements and salary increases should be implemented.

1625
02:04:45,034 --> 02:04:48,156
We then received an opinion from KP law and then a revised opinion from KP law.

1626
02:04:48,776 --> 02:04:52,079
again, KP Lawyers stated that they're not the city's attorney, they're the mayor's private attorney.

1627
02:04:52,479 --> 02:04:56,542
They've given us two contrary legal opinions to the standing and acting legal city solicitor at the time.

1628
02:04:57,343 --> 02:05:00,685
So, you know, we're kind of in the same circumstance with this paper that we were in the others.

1629
02:05:01,446 --> 02:05:04,148
Okay, we're gonna go on this paper first.

1630
02:05:07,390 --> 02:05:08,010
Please call the roll.

1631
02:05:09,752 --> 02:05:09,992
Yes.

1632
02:05:12,033 --> 02:05:12,314
Yes.

1633
02:05:13,715 --> 02:05:13,895
Yes.

1634
02:05:16,277 --> 02:05:16,497
Yes.

1635
02:05:25,177 --> 02:05:27,658
unless the conflict of interest is what their rules say.

1636
02:05:29,800 --> 02:05:30,120
Okay.

1637
02:05:33,982 --> 02:05:34,242
Yes.

1638
02:05:35,563 --> 02:05:35,783
Yes.

1639
02:05:35,803 --> 02:05:37,304
7 in front of zero negative motion.

1640
02:05:37,564 --> 02:05:38,184
Yes.

1641
02:05:38,284 --> 02:05:42,267
Motion to table passes.

1642
02:05:42,287 --> 02:05:51,812
23-057 to Honorable President Morrell and members of the Memphis City Council regarding request to establish the traffic and transportation director position in the city's classification compensation plan resubmitted

1643
02:05:52,298 --> 02:06:11,996
Dear President Morrell and members of the City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that the City Council approve the following amendment to the revised ordinances, chapter 66, entitled personnel, article two, entitled reserve, the city's classification and compensation plan, formally included as article two, sections 66-31 through 66-40, by adopting the following language change.

1644
02:06:12,416 --> 02:06:17,881
The language of PW 2022 shall be amended to include the following position, traffic and transportation director,

1645
02:06:18,504 --> 02:06:29,752
traffic and transportation director position is filled by a current staff member who took on a new role with additional responsibilities and was included in the FY 22 and 23 budgets but the title has not been added to the city's classification and compensation plan.

1646
02:06:30,193 --> 02:06:36,978
Based on the October 20, 2022 KP law memo, personal ordinance amendments dash quantum of vote requirement end quote,

1647
02:06:37,574 --> 02:06:47,579
It is our revised opinion that this classification requires four votes under general laws, chapter 44, section 33A, along with a supplemental appropriation for which we have submitted an associated paper.

1648
02:06:47,919 --> 02:06:51,880
Chief of staff, Ian Nazarian, is available to speak to this request and answer any questions you may have.

1649
02:06:52,301 --> 02:06:53,661
Thank you for your kind attention to this matter.

1650
02:06:53,721 --> 02:06:54,442
Respectfully submitted.

1651
02:06:54,462 --> 02:06:55,442
We're gonna allow the current mayor.

1652
02:06:57,563 --> 02:06:58,603
Councilor Knight, would you like to continue?

1653
02:06:58,623 --> 02:06:59,664
Do you have anything else you'd like to add?

1654
02:06:59,924 --> 02:07:01,545
No, as previously stated, Madam President.

1655
02:07:02,245 --> 02:07:03,586
I think the gentleman's doing great work, though.

1656
02:07:03,606 --> 02:07:04,126
Don't get me wrong.

1657
02:07:07,188 --> 02:07:10,616
thinks the gentleman is doing great work don't get him wrong.

1658
02:07:11,839 --> 02:07:15,446
Any members of the Council wish to speak, I'm happy to hear from them first.

1659
02:07:18,789 --> 02:07:18,989
Sure.

1660
02:07:19,890 --> 02:07:25,055
I just I'm here to say that this is the letters, I think, say exactly what we're here for.

1661
02:07:25,115 --> 02:07:34,784
But I will say that this was part of the strategy strategy multiple years ago to have a director of traffic and transportation position in the city.

1662
02:07:35,905 --> 02:07:43,452
I think we all agree that it's been a very valuable thing for the city to have traffic and transportation engineers on staff at the engineering office.

1663
02:07:44,052 --> 02:07:49,396
I believe that the value that they have added to the city is tremendous.

1664
02:07:49,456 --> 02:07:56,541
So the step to make it, to make that a director level position, I think is a critical step for the city.

1665
02:07:58,062 --> 02:08:02,545
And so we can continue to provide that service that I believe the city needs.

1666
02:08:02,845 --> 02:08:06,147
So hopefully this finds its way to passage.

1667
02:08:06,567 --> 02:08:07,448
So thank you very much.

1668
02:08:07,748 --> 02:08:08,028
Thank you.

1669
02:08:09,449 --> 02:08:10,050
Councilor Scarpa.

1670
02:08:10,310 --> 02:08:11,851
Again, Madam President, again, I don't,

1671
02:08:13,112 --> 02:08:21,198
Um, it's not that I don't support, uh, traffic, uh, engineer.

1672
02:08:21,238 --> 02:08:23,140
I think that he does an amazing job.

1673
02:08:23,180 --> 02:08:28,063
But again, I think that there's too many questions still haven't been asked or answered.

1674
02:08:28,544 --> 02:08:33,087
Uh, when we've sent that out, I reiterate what Councilor Knight said.

1675
02:08:33,828 --> 02:08:41,654
Our city solicitor said that there were some concerns with the process and agreed with this council.

1676
02:08:42,441 --> 02:08:49,303
And then, again, we get contradictory feedback from KP Law, so I'm left in limbo.

1677
02:08:49,543 --> 02:08:56,885
I don't think that we can move forward with any of these caps or increases or change of salaries.

1678
02:08:57,465 --> 02:08:59,106
Although, do I think it deserves it?

1679
02:08:59,186 --> 02:09:10,729
Absolutely, but it's also, what we're seeing is you have other departments that people are picking up duties

1680
02:09:11,502 --> 02:09:12,763
and not being compensated.

1681
02:09:13,103 --> 02:09:25,452
And I'll give you an example of the veteran director who was put into position back in the day when he was the hearing officer and he was waiting to be compensated.

1682
02:09:25,812 --> 02:09:31,336
And don't forget that day because people that were here remember the injustice there.

1683
02:09:31,396 --> 02:09:33,978
So here we are now in the same situation.

1684
02:09:34,058 --> 02:09:38,301
So this isn't how business works in the municipality.

1685
02:09:38,921 --> 02:09:40,082
Although as much as I like

1686
02:09:41,087 --> 02:09:41,647
the director.

1687
02:09:41,667 --> 02:09:44,168
I don't you can't be picking and choosing.

1688
02:09:44,228 --> 02:09:45,449
I think it's a slippery slope.

1689
02:09:45,989 --> 02:09:56,273
And again, this is why, you know, not having having a conflicting legal, um, representation is a huge problem.

1690
02:09:56,694 --> 02:09:59,255
So I won't be able to support this.

1691
02:09:59,275 --> 02:09:59,715
Thank you.

1692
02:10:00,775 --> 02:10:01,616
Thank you, Madam President.

1693
02:10:01,776 --> 02:10:03,877
I respect my colleagues positions on this.

1694
02:10:03,917 --> 02:10:04,157
I think

1695
02:10:05,452 --> 02:10:06,533
There's been a number of issues.

1696
02:10:06,653 --> 02:10:16,561
I think that maybe the chain of events and the opinions are getting a little bit conflated, but I, again, I respect my fellow councilors positions.

1697
02:10:18,083 --> 02:10:26,129
To me, the way that this is presented tonight, it's very clear that a new position in the city does not exist until it is approved in the cap.

1698
02:10:26,289 --> 02:10:33,015
This is presented as a new position to be added to the cap, which did not exist prior to any action that we take on this.

1699
02:10:35,100 --> 02:10:48,539
We did receive legal advice from KP Law, a memorandum from KP Law around these issues, clearly delineating the requirements of Chapter 44, Section 33A.

1700
02:10:49,500 --> 02:10:51,102
And when it comes to creating a new position,

1701
02:10:52,929 --> 02:10:53,950
that requires four votes.

1702
02:10:55,450 --> 02:10:58,391
If it's something else, there's other requirements.

1703
02:10:59,212 --> 02:11:07,555
But this is, I think, to me, very similar to the senior planner position that was created by this council and amended to the CAF in late last year.

1704
02:11:07,575 --> 02:11:13,518
And I also think, and I'm just gonna say what I said at that meeting,

1705
02:11:16,704 --> 02:11:20,971
The work that we do here is a balancing of interests and a balancing of what's best for the city.

1706
02:11:20,991 --> 02:11:26,559
I personally feel confident on this paper and the legal justification behind it.

1707
02:11:27,561 --> 02:11:28,542
And I also feel that.

1708
02:11:30,649 --> 02:11:49,381
this person that the creation of a traffic and transportation director, and making sure that a person who fills that role has the multiple years of experience with the city that the person who would, you know, likely be taking the role has is essential, and we know that there are

1709
02:11:51,002 --> 02:11:54,465
not enough experts to fill too many open jobs.

1710
02:11:54,625 --> 02:12:11,398
There are other communities, there are state agencies that are looking for people with the expertise of this position and that's why I personally am going to support this tonight because I want to make sure that this city

1711
02:12:13,834 --> 02:12:19,781
that we as a city council are making sure that the city has the staff and tools that the city needs to be successful.

1712
02:12:20,782 --> 02:12:24,026
And that's my reasoning.

1713
02:12:24,086 --> 02:12:25,268
So thank you, Madam President.

1714
02:12:25,708 --> 02:12:27,110
Thank you, Councilor Collins and Councilor Singh.

1715
02:12:28,852 --> 02:12:29,813
Thank you, President Morrell.

1716
02:12:36,704 --> 02:12:44,429
I appreciate my federal counselors sharing their thoughts about this, and I appreciate that it is kind of in conversation with the previous paper.

1717
02:12:44,449 --> 02:12:57,336
I will be supporting this tonight, and like I said on the previous paper about the loan order, I would have been comfortable going forward with that paper.

1718
02:12:57,417 --> 02:13:04,421
I think we heard from the expert in the room that it's not gonna be catastrophic to wait on that for two weeks, so I was comfortable with that middle ground.

1719
02:13:05,792 --> 02:13:15,236
And I also said, I think every council has to make their own decision about, you know, what tactics to use and where we feel comfortable drawing a line in the sand.

1720
02:13:15,536 --> 02:13:18,477
And as Mr. Behrs put it, weighing those balances.

1721
02:13:21,398 --> 02:13:26,200
As every project that comes before us is important to the functioning of the city in some way.

1722
02:13:27,661 --> 02:13:30,842
My understanding, this is the first reading anyway, and we know that we're getting that legal opinion.

1723
02:13:34,071 --> 02:13:37,114
And this, the creation of this position I think is very overdue.

1724
02:13:37,134 --> 02:13:55,511
It's very important to the city it's important to me, the D the, you know, acting traffic and transportation director person currently in that role once it's codified I think is one of the experts in the city that I've turned to the most of the city councilor on the incredibly responsive it helped me out was scores of

1725
02:13:56,377 --> 02:14:01,499
constituent problems and complaints and questions over the past 14 months.

1726
02:14:01,659 --> 02:14:16,583
And I just think that the creation of this position is critical to where we are as a city today in the 21st century with just the sheer amount of traffic and transportation related projects and problems that come across my email inbox.

1727
02:14:17,824 --> 02:14:22,685
This is a motion that I'm personally not willing to wait for.

1728
02:14:22,705 --> 02:14:25,546
So I'll be voicing my support tonight,

1729
02:14:26,530 --> 02:14:29,111
Thanks, my fellow counselors for listening to my explanation.

1730
02:14:29,652 --> 02:14:31,413
Thank you.

1731
02:14:31,473 --> 02:14:32,473
Thank you, President Burrell.

1732
02:14:33,153 --> 02:14:36,875
I hear my fellow colleagues and their different viewpoints on this issue.

1733
02:14:38,576 --> 02:14:46,340
I, however, do plan to vote yes on this because, as for the same reasons, Councilor Behrs has elaborated.

1734
02:14:48,434 --> 02:14:50,356
I believe the legal reasoning is pretty sound here.

1735
02:14:50,396 --> 02:14:51,097
It's pretty clear.

1736
02:14:51,197 --> 02:14:52,819
We've been through this before.

1737
02:14:53,620 --> 02:14:58,665
We've talked about this exact procedure before, and it is a new position.

1738
02:15:00,007 --> 02:15:06,494
When I approach a vote like this, I also think about what the practical everyday effects are.

1739
02:15:07,275 --> 02:15:16,130
And I do fear, as, as we, you know, we're always talking about the difficulty of hiring city staff and the difficulty of retaining city staff.

1740
02:15:19,909 --> 02:15:26,334
that we would lose staff to different communities that are willing to pay more to the state agencies who are willing to pay more.

1741
02:15:27,055 --> 02:15:44,409
And I think this role is so vital to the everyday functioning of our city and as Councilor Collins referred to the constituents requests for their city government to serve them.

1742
02:15:45,310 --> 02:15:45,450
And

1743
02:15:46,591 --> 02:15:51,856
I just, I just believe that we would be severely harmed if we don't move forward with this.

1744
02:15:52,677 --> 02:15:54,659
Um, yeah.

1745
02:15:55,320 --> 02:15:58,903
Thank you.

1746
02:15:58,944 --> 02:15:59,264
Thank you.

1747
02:15:59,884 --> 02:16:05,810
I just just to be clear, I appreciate these comments and I think that that's what's great about this forum.

1748
02:16:06,211 --> 02:16:07,072
But again, this is

1749
02:16:09,542 --> 02:16:19,694
as 23-057 then leads off to 23-058 and that's gonna talk about the differential in the salary.

1750
02:16:20,595 --> 02:16:23,318
I want us all to look at that and realize that

1751
02:16:24,076 --> 02:16:30,940
does, because it seems to me that we're going to be losing a union position and all of us here are union supporters, correct?

1752
02:16:31,580 --> 02:16:44,708
This compensation for what reads in the next resolution, the increase of the funding using salaries would be funded because of a highway salaries account due to temporary vacancies in the senior clerk position.

1753
02:16:45,409 --> 02:16:48,571
So does that mean that we're losing the senior clerk position to fund this position?

1754
02:16:50,792 --> 02:16:50,892
No.

1755
02:16:51,974 --> 02:16:53,075
No.

1756
02:16:53,095 --> 02:16:54,016
So what does that mean?

1757
02:16:54,357 --> 02:16:56,900
Just for clarification purposes.

1758
02:16:56,920 --> 02:17:00,123
So when this person does come back, Tim, we're gonna hire this person back full salary?

1759
02:17:01,025 --> 02:17:04,609
And then how are we gonna pay this position if that money's being used somewhere else?

1760
02:17:06,069 --> 02:17:10,611
I don't have an answer to that question, but I know that I haven't agreed to any losing any position.

1761
02:17:10,691 --> 02:17:14,072
So my full understanding is that we wouldn't be losing any position.

1762
02:17:14,092 --> 02:17:18,674
Chief of staff Nazarian here, just because that's something that's important before I vote.

1763
02:17:18,934 --> 02:17:27,738
If you look for both papers together, this is approving something that is still questionable because of not understanding the true legal separation of two different parties.

1764
02:17:28,178 --> 02:17:31,519
But then the next page talks about the funding of that position.

1765
02:17:32,080 --> 02:17:35,001
And that's looks like eliminating a union position.

1766
02:17:35,672 --> 02:17:37,454
So is Chief of Staff here?

1767
02:17:37,474 --> 02:17:38,715
Madam Chief of Staff's not on the call.

1768
02:17:38,775 --> 02:17:39,195
Oh, that's good.

1769
02:17:39,215 --> 02:17:40,276
I don't know why she's not on the call.

1770
02:17:40,316 --> 02:17:41,417
She did say she was, though, right?

1771
02:17:41,437 --> 02:17:44,679
Yeah, I don't know why she's not on the call.

1772
02:17:44,699 --> 02:17:46,741
I can speak to it a little bit, Madam President.

1773
02:17:47,181 --> 02:17:55,568
Just that not having the senior clerk accrued some value in that particular line to cover the increase for this year.

1774
02:17:56,028 --> 02:18:01,073
So I believe it would need to be presented to you in a budget for following years after the creation of the CAF.

1775
02:18:01,813 --> 02:18:03,975
Is there someone in that position now, or does it remain vacant?

1776
02:18:05,517 --> 02:18:09,561
I believe we have all of our clerk positions filled in DPW right now.

1777
02:18:09,621 --> 02:18:11,883
Okay, so it was a past vacancy that's been filled?

1778
02:18:12,043 --> 02:18:12,444
Correct.

1779
02:18:12,704 --> 02:18:16,027
So all of our clerk positions are filled at the moment.

1780
02:18:16,508 --> 02:18:16,848
Thank you.

1781
02:18:17,909 --> 02:18:18,810
If I can, just...

1782
02:18:19,906 --> 02:18:28,090
This is the increase the funding using the salaries of funded curve, the DPW salaries account due to a temporary vacancy and the senior clerk's position.

1783
02:18:28,170 --> 02:18:30,512
That person is now, they hired the person now?

1784
02:18:31,312 --> 02:18:32,673
There was a vacancies back?

1785
02:18:32,953 --> 02:18:33,293
Yes.

1786
02:18:33,713 --> 02:18:34,434
Okay, thank you.

1787
02:18:34,874 --> 02:18:36,015
Vice President Behrs.

1788
02:18:36,855 --> 02:18:37,916
Thank you, Madam President.

1789
02:18:37,976 --> 02:18:40,417
I'd move to approve this paper for first reading.

1790
02:18:41,337 --> 02:18:44,139
I do see Councilor Cabrillo.

1791
02:18:44,279 --> 02:18:45,180
I don't know if he's coming back.

1792
02:18:45,200 --> 02:18:45,920
I can see him out there.

1793
02:18:46,060 --> 02:18:47,741
He wants to vote on that.

1794
02:18:49,807 --> 02:18:59,189
Yeah, and the other thing I would just say is I do believe the traffic and transportation director and the position was included in the new unit of management positions that was organized by level 25.

1795
02:18:59,369 --> 02:19:01,729
So I don't believe there'll be a loss of the union position.

1796
02:19:02,350 --> 02:19:04,510
Just clarify that.

1797
02:19:05,350 --> 02:19:07,391
I don't want to lose that clerical position.

1798
02:19:07,431 --> 02:19:14,372
Councilor Carvalho, we have a motion to approve paper 23-057, adding the new

1799
02:19:20,131 --> 02:19:24,134
traffic and transportation director position to that path for first reading.

1800
02:19:25,174 --> 02:19:28,016
So on the motion of vices and affairs is seconded by Councilor Sang.

1801
02:19:28,036 --> 02:19:29,277
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1802
02:19:29,317 --> 02:19:29,437
Yes.

1803
02:19:35,981 --> 02:19:36,141
Yes.

1804
02:19:36,181 --> 02:19:36,301
No.

1805
02:19:36,321 --> 02:19:36,381
No.

1806
02:19:49,773 --> 02:19:50,253
Councilor Seheult.

1807
02:19:50,333 --> 02:19:50,574
Yes.

1808
02:19:51,414 --> 02:19:51,854
Councilor Morocco.

1809
02:19:52,174 --> 02:19:52,375
Yes.

1810
02:19:52,675 --> 02:19:54,316
Four in the affirmative, three in the negative.

1811
02:19:54,396 --> 02:19:56,357
The motion passes for first reading.

1812
02:19:57,518 --> 02:19:58,098
Thank you.

1813
02:19:58,799 --> 02:20:07,944
And then 23-058, to Honorable President Morrell and members of the Medford City Council regarding appropriation requests for traffic and transportation director salary differential resubmitted.

1814
02:20:08,525 --> 02:20:17,090
Dear President Morrell and members of the City Council, I respectfully request to transfer $4,175 in available funding from DPW highway salaries accounts

1815
02:20:17,756 --> 02:20:34,110
010-421-5110 to DPW engineering salaries account 010-411-5110 and to appropriate set funding to pay for the salary differential associated with establishing the traffic and transportation director as a PW22 and the city's classification and compensation plan.

1816
02:20:34,671 --> 02:20:42,958
The transfer funds the salary differential for a total of 24.6 weeks in FY23, assuming the new classification goes into effect on February 28th, 2023.

1817
02:20:42,998 --> 02:20:43,478
This increase will be

1818
02:20:46,018 --> 02:20:53,102
will be funding using the salary funding that accrued in the DPW highway salaries account due to temporary vacancy of the senior clerk position.

1819
02:20:53,942 --> 02:20:59,625
Chief of staffing in this area is available to speak to this request, as well as the associated classification request and answer any questions you may have.

1820
02:20:59,765 --> 02:21:02,987
We need for your attention to the matter, respectfully submitted, grant along with current mayor.

1821
02:21:03,647 --> 02:21:04,388
Motion to approve.

1822
02:21:05,808 --> 02:21:09,110
Any discussion from the council?

1823
02:21:09,410 --> 02:21:14,133
I prefer a motion to table till third reading on the underlying ordinance, Madam President.

1824
02:21:15,430 --> 02:21:21,014
Certainly a paper I'm going to support funding if the underlying position passes.

1825
02:21:23,336 --> 02:21:25,958

02:21:30,581 --> 02:21:33,123

Yes.

1847

Yes.

1848
02:22:56,851 --> 02:22:57,072

1850
02:22:57,672 --> 02:22:57,932
Yes.

1851
02:22:58,493 --> 02:22:58,973
Yes.

1852
02:22:59,153 --> 02:22:59,333
Yes.

1853
02:23:13,362 --> 02:23:28,498
The last, this last one that donation acceptance is 23 dashes 23 dashes 062 marble present around members of the Metro City Council regarding donation acceptances here present morale and members of the city council.

1854
02:23:29,025 --> 02:23:51,846

1855
02:23:52,806 --> 02:23:54,328
One to each wooden bookcase

1856
02:23:54,827 --> 02:24:07,357
two 4-H wooden bookcases, five L-shaped desks, three desks, two 5-H lateral files, one 4-H lateral file, one sofa, one coffee table, one metal console table, four pet files, four workstations.

1857
02:24:07,397 --> 02:24:09,059
Respectfully submitted, Breanna Longo Kern.

1858
02:24:09,759 --> 02:24:13,502
Was that the Dunkin' Donuts commercial?

1859
02:24:14,623 --> 02:24:17,786
Is this something you did, right?

1860
02:24:18,386 --> 02:24:20,588
I just want Councilor Scavana to get credit for it.

1861
02:24:24,864 --> 02:24:30,729
If I can, Madam President, the Furniture Trust Company is an amazing organization.

1862
02:24:32,691 --> 02:24:47,805
They are an organization that goes in, especially during the pandemic, and go into these multi-billion dollar office buildings that haven't even opened, that were built prior to the pandemic, and have furniture that is

1863
02:24:49,534 --> 02:24:51,396
brand new and untouched.

1864
02:24:51,996 --> 02:24:55,539
And they're brought in to throw away all this brand new equipment.

1865
02:24:56,180 --> 02:24:57,761
So what they've done is gone.

1866
02:24:57,901 --> 02:25:00,643
They reach out to all nonprofits.

1867
02:25:01,544 --> 02:25:06,448
I will tell you in recreation, they've refurbished our teen center.

1868
02:25:07,149 --> 02:25:12,613
They've worked with our administrative staff in the school department and multiple other locations.

1869
02:25:12,673 --> 02:25:15,636
I know that prior to the pandemic,

1870
02:25:17,722 --> 02:25:25,446
Mr. Zarian, I know that all that furniture that was in here, the movie company, all that was donated.

1871
02:25:25,486 --> 02:25:29,007
So I appreciate the hard work that the Furniture Trust Company does.

1872
02:25:29,027 --> 02:25:34,170
It's a former Method resident, Pat Redden, who spearheads that endeavor.

1873
02:25:34,410 --> 02:25:36,931
And he just called me today.

1874
02:25:38,812 --> 02:25:49,206
He's helping homeless family and making sure that they're donating furniture for homeless families and different homeless organizations.

1875
02:25:50,368 --> 02:25:56,396
Framingham State closed the whole dorm and they took all of the furniture

1876
02:25:57,449 --> 02:26:02,251
bureaus and betting and moved it over to a homeless center in the past.

1877
02:26:02,271 --> 02:26:08,354
So they do so many great things and I appreciate, I know this is a hard, difficult thing to do.

1878
02:26:08,394 --> 02:26:11,635
It took a little while to get this signed off, but we appreciate everything you do.

1879
02:26:12,115 --> 02:26:13,656
Thank you, Councilor Villes for pointing that out.

1880
02:26:13,676 --> 02:26:15,917
I want to make sure they get their credit too, so.

1881
02:26:16,391 --> 02:26:17,211
Thank you, Councilor Scrappelli.

1882
02:26:17,231 --> 02:26:20,673
We actually come across the Furniture Trust in my day job.

1883
02:26:20,773 --> 02:26:25,135
Your support for reuse is admirable and appreciated.

1884
02:26:25,195 --> 02:26:26,296
So I'm excited to see this.

1885
02:26:27,416 --> 02:26:31,358
We have motion to approve from Councilor Knight, seconded by- Second.

1886
02:26:31,738 --> 02:26:32,318
Vice President Behrs.

1887
02:26:32,338 --> 02:26:33,559
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1888
02:26:34,059 --> 02:26:35,460
Vice President Behrs.

1889
02:26:36,280 --> 02:26:36,580
Yes.

1890
02:26:38,341 --> 02:26:38,961
Councilor Kerrio.

1891
02:26:39,021 --> 02:26:39,362
Yes.

1892
02:26:39,702 --> 02:26:40,362
Councilor Collins.

1893
02:26:40,402 --> 02:26:40,642
Yes.

1894
02:26:41,062 --> 02:26:41,583
Councilor Knight.

1895
02:26:42,043 --> 02:26:42,283
Yes.

1896
02:26:47,010 --> 02:26:49,291
Yes, I mean the inferno is during the night of the motion passes.

1897
02:26:53,932 --> 02:26:57,053
Council Collins, would you like to revert to regular order of business?

1898
02:26:57,373 --> 02:26:59,153
Everyone else is having side conversations.

1899
02:27:02,434 --> 02:27:06,395
On the motion of Councilor Collins to revert to regular order of business, seconded by Vice President Behrs.

1900
02:27:07,095 --> 02:27:08,135
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1901
02:27:13,157 --> 02:27:15,618
Well, I want to take that water suspension.

1902
02:27:17,118 --> 02:27:18,318
I have not seen there.

1903
02:27:20,039 --> 02:27:20,319
I have.

1904
02:27:20,799 --> 02:27:22,720
Yeah, I haven't seen her this whole time.

1905
02:27:23,300 --> 02:27:23,620
We didn't.

1906
02:27:23,860 --> 02:27:24,880
She wasn't waiting the whole time.

1907
02:27:24,920 --> 02:27:26,301
Thankfully, I haven't seen her this whole time.

1908
02:27:27,301 --> 02:27:27,841
Yeah.

1909
02:27:27,961 --> 02:27:28,981
Okay.

1910
02:27:29,462 --> 02:27:32,762
Can we do we have to tell that or can you just keep on the agenda?

1911
02:27:32,942 --> 02:27:33,843
We'll just keep it on the agenda.

1912
02:27:33,923 --> 02:27:34,183
Okay.

1913
02:27:35,403 --> 02:27:38,224
No, I haven't seen her on zoom the entire time, at least under that name.

1914
02:27:38,244 --> 02:27:39,604
So,

1915
02:27:42,719 --> 02:27:55,205
On the motion of Councillor Collins server back to regular order of business second by vice affairs Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1916
02:27:55,286 --> 02:27:55,486
Yes.

1917
02:27:58,367 --> 02:27:58,647
Yes.

1918
02:28:01,169 --> 02:28:02,069
Yes.

1919
02:28:02,189 --> 02:28:02,429
Yes.

1920
02:28:03,510 --> 02:28:11,734
Yes, I mean if I was in a motion passes back to the regular order of business records the records from February 14 2023 were passed your counselor saying counselor saying how did you find them.

1921
02:28:15,860 --> 02:28:21,963
I found them in order, but I was just going to move to approve the records and all the reports of committees in one vote.

1922
02:28:22,323 --> 02:28:23,964
Okay.

1923
02:28:24,124 --> 02:28:26,025
Does anyone need a refresher on the reports of committees or?

1924
02:28:26,645 --> 02:28:26,845
Great.

1925
02:28:27,025 --> 02:28:36,049
So on the motion of Councilor Seng, no, on the motion of Vice President Behrs, seconded by Councilor Knight to approve the records and all reports of committees.

1926
02:28:36,549 --> 02:28:38,270
Mr. Clerk, it's plural.

1927
02:28:38,290 --> 02:28:40,311
Vice President Behrs.

1928
02:28:45,472 --> 02:28:47,313
Yes.

1929
02:28:47,813 --> 02:28:49,934
Yes.

1930
02:28:51,916 --> 02:29:04,582
Yes, seven the affirmative zero negative motion passes to three dash zero four, sorry to three dash zero four six offered by Council night be it so resolved the city administration take the necessary steps to register and garage the parking enforcement vehicles in the city of Medford.

1931
02:29:06,088 --> 02:29:13,318
Yes, Madam President, it's been brought to my attention that parking enforcement vehicles aren't garage in the state, even nevermind the city of Medford.

1932
02:29:13,638 --> 02:29:21,589
I've seen the vehicles driving around town with the nice fancy city of Medford sticker on it says parking enforcement on it, parking enforcement officers are in it but other vehicles.

1933
02:29:22,229 --> 02:29:25,932
are not registered in the state of Massachusetts or in the city of Medford.

1934
02:29:26,773 --> 02:29:39,943
So I believe that was a criteria in our previous contract with Republic Parking, and I see no reason why these vehicles shouldn't be both garaged and insured in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, nevermind the city of Medford.

1935
02:29:41,404 --> 02:29:42,045
Thank you, Councilor.

1936
02:29:42,105 --> 02:29:47,089
Leaving City Hall last week, I did see a parking vehicle with a Connecticut license plate, so I can't affirm this is.

1937
02:29:48,243 --> 02:29:50,945
Something that has not yet happened, at least as of last week.

1938
02:29:51,726 --> 02:29:52,867
Any further discussion from the council?

1939
02:29:54,748 --> 02:29:57,070
On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Behrs.

1940
02:29:57,110 --> 02:29:58,191
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1941
02:30:02,354 --> 02:30:02,555
Yes.

1942
02:30:03,756 --> 02:30:05,217
Yes.

1943
02:30:05,877 --> 02:30:06,198
Yes.

1944
02:30:08,139 --> 02:30:09,740
Yes.

1945
02:30:09,780 --> 02:30:10,001
Yes.

1946
02:30:11,062 --> 02:30:11,262
Yes.

1947
02:30:11,462 --> 02:30:12,763
Seven affirmative, zero negative.

1948
02:30:12,783 --> 02:30:13,443
Motion passes.

1949
02:30:14,381 --> 02:30:24,489
23 dash 047 offered by Councilor night, be it so resolved the city administration take the necessary steps to restore the damages to the waterfront abutting the Hormel community, sorry, Hormel Stadium community gardens.

1950
02:30:25,050 --> 02:30:36,979
As a result of unauthorized clear cutting of trees brush bushes and other natural growth along the waterline, and be it further resolved the tree warden representative from the Conservation Commission and a representative from the Community Garden Commission perform a site visit.

1951
02:30:37,526 --> 02:30:49,594
and report back to the council the extent of the damages and an estimated cost of restoration and be it further resolved that the assistance of the Mystic River Watershed Association be requested to ensure restoration is in coordination with their master plan.

1952
02:30:49,915 --> 02:30:50,335
Councillor Nye.

1953
02:30:51,567 --> 02:30:53,829
That was pretty good, all in one breath, Madam President.

1954
02:30:53,909 --> 02:30:54,669
I appreciate that.

1955
02:30:54,689 --> 02:31:07,678
Well, ultimately, it's been brought to my attention that there's been some unauthorized clear-cutting of forestry between the community garden and the dog park, say, going down to the waterfront over by Homel Stadium.

1956
02:31:07,859 --> 02:31:10,200
It's caused a little bit of disruption to our ecosystem.

1957
02:31:11,081 --> 02:31:15,404
The matter has been brought to the attention of the Office of Energy and Environment.

1958
02:31:15,684 --> 02:31:19,066
Dennis McDougal has been involved in the

1959
02:31:20,825 --> 02:31:22,806
examination and restoration of the area.

1960
02:31:22,826 --> 02:31:50,503
The police department has also been contacted relative to the circumstances, but the clear-cutting persists, Madam President, so this is something that I'm hoping we can get ahead of, take a look at, maybe do some intervention, educate some people in the community about the dangers of clear-cutting forestry, especially abutting the Mystic River watershed, and maybe move forward and restore some of the damage that has been done to further beautify the area that's utilized by so many in this community.

1961
02:31:52,056 --> 02:31:52,736
Thank you, Councilor Night.

1962
02:31:52,816 --> 02:31:53,537
Vice President Behrs.

1963
02:31:53,557 --> 02:31:54,697
Thank you, Madam President.

1964
02:31:55,017 --> 02:32:00,779
I know you're on your way out the door, Commissioner McGibbert, but have you heard about this?

1965
02:32:00,859 --> 02:32:02,580
Do you know anything about this?

1966
02:32:02,680 --> 02:32:05,741
And or Councilor Night, could you further say who's doing the clearcutting?

1967
02:32:08,122 --> 02:32:09,062
That I do not know.

1968
02:32:09,082 --> 02:32:09,442
Okay.

1969
02:32:17,878 --> 02:32:30,170
I guess an enforcement order, I believe it's what it's called, was issued by the Conservation Commission to one person for just that clearing brush that's protected under the Wellands Protection Act.

1970
02:32:30,210 --> 02:32:30,911
It's near a river.

1971
02:32:31,932 --> 02:32:34,254
I believe the activity has come to an end.

1972
02:32:34,294 --> 02:32:34,755
I'm not 100% sure on that.

1973
02:32:36,586 --> 02:32:43,612
We also had some volunteer groups, I believe, do some proper maintenance that was approved by DCR.

1974
02:32:44,053 --> 02:32:49,237
So I just want to be clear that that activity was happening as well, but that was legitimate activity.

1975
02:32:49,878 --> 02:32:58,242
And then we had this activity by one individual, from what I understand, who was taking it upon himself to take care of our waterfront.

1976
02:32:59,583 --> 02:33:01,624
So that's my understanding of the whole situation.

1977
02:33:01,644 --> 02:33:07,287
But again, I was just briefed on these issues, so I don't have a full detailed understanding.

1978
02:33:07,607 --> 02:33:08,687
Alicia Hunt is still on the call.

1979
02:33:08,707 --> 02:33:09,788
She has her hand up as well.

1980
02:33:09,968 --> 02:33:10,368
Great.

1981
02:33:11,329 --> 02:33:11,629
Thank you.

1982
02:33:11,649 --> 02:33:12,049
Thank you.

1983
02:33:17,412 --> 02:33:21,254
Madam President, yes, actually, Commissioner McGivern got that completely correct.

1984
02:33:22,135 --> 02:33:39,084
This was an activity that was occurring last spring and over the summer, and we had a hard time finding it happening to stop it, but a member of the Riverbend Garden did contact our office, let us know when it was actually happening.

1985
02:33:39,104 --> 02:33:45,887
Our environmental agent, Dennis McDougal, went down there, spoke with the individual who was

1986
02:33:47,409 --> 02:33:48,250
argumentative.

1987
02:33:49,231 --> 02:33:55,157
The Conservation Commission issued an enforcement order that he should stop.

1988
02:33:57,340 --> 02:34:00,123
We appreciate the help of our police department.

1989
02:34:00,483 --> 02:34:01,865
Enforcement orders have to be

1990
02:34:03,800 --> 02:34:06,161
You have to sign that you've received it.

1991
02:34:06,201 --> 02:34:07,321
There needs to be legal proof.

1992
02:34:08,421 --> 02:34:12,643
And so when somebody's issued something like this, they don't always want to sign.

1993
02:34:13,103 --> 02:34:20,485
So the police officer was able to verify for us that it was, in fact, delivered by an officer by hand.

1994
02:34:23,686 --> 02:34:29,808
We've kept an eye on the area, and there's been no further cutting in that area.

1995
02:34:31,809 --> 02:34:42,166
By that individual as the commissioner explained, we did have some organized invasives removing and Vista pruning that occurred.

1996
02:34:42,938 --> 02:34:48,800
in the area adjacent to that that was done correctly under the supervision of our tree warden.

1997
02:34:49,800 --> 02:34:56,922
We encourage any residents who think that we're not clearing our vistas well enough and removing invasives to come and speak with us.

1998
02:34:57,683 --> 02:35:03,605
The Mystic River Watershed Association does organize volunteer vista pruning events.

1999
02:35:04,445 --> 02:35:07,506
We've been keeping an eye on the area to determine whether

2000
02:35:08,346 --> 02:35:17,069
uh, planting makes sense this spring or whether it'll, um, just fill in appropriately as needed.

2001
02:35:17,089 --> 02:35:23,192
Um, but yeah, limbs of trees were cut and large and trees that should not have been cut were cut as well.

2002
02:35:23,952 --> 02:35:30,174
Um, and, uh, DPW and DCR were very helpful in removing the large piles of brush that appeared.

2003
02:35:30,194 --> 02:35:34,116
Uh, I think, um, I think that covers everything you asked about?

2004
02:35:34,136 --> 02:35:36,497
I believe so.

2005
02:35:36,537 --> 02:35:36,857
Perfect.

2006
02:35:38,629 --> 02:35:39,409
Thank you, Director.

2007
02:35:39,610 --> 02:35:40,650
Any further discussion on the council.

2008
02:35:43,011 --> 02:35:44,532
Thank you for bringing this forward.

2009
02:35:44,552 --> 02:35:49,195
So on the motion of Councilor Madam President, Madam President, I'm gonna throw the motion on the questions been asked and answered.

2010
02:35:49,215 --> 02:35:52,977
You know, it seems like everything that we were going to request they've already done.

2011
02:35:53,997 --> 02:35:54,338
Great.

2012
02:35:55,098 --> 02:35:55,358
Thank you.

2013
02:35:58,335 --> 02:36:16,242
23-048 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council requests the city administration take the necessary steps to require that DCR and DOT perform roadway maintenance repairs on all on-ramps and off-ramps under their respective jurisdictions, and be it further resolved that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to our state delegation.

2014
02:36:16,382 --> 02:36:16,782
Councilor Knight.

2015
02:36:17,635 --> 02:36:32,449
Madam President's rather self explanatory, as you'll know, on ramps and off ramps to 9316 and the like are in some rough shape, and I'm hoping that the dot can come out and give it a little bit of 10 to 11 care to prevent any damage to the resident of cities vehicles.

2016
02:36:34,611 --> 02:36:34,872
Thank you.

2017
02:36:34,892 --> 02:36:35,272
That's right.

2018
02:36:35,332 --> 02:36:36,573
Any further discussion from the council.

2019
02:36:37,634 --> 02:36:41,398
So, on the motion of Council night seconded by Councilor Carlyle Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2020
02:36:49,897 --> 02:36:50,117
Yes.

2021
02:36:51,618 --> 02:36:51,858
Yes.

2022
02:36:53,659 --> 02:36:55,381
Yes.

2023
02:36:56,601 --> 02:36:56,842
Yes.

2024
02:36:56,862 --> 02:37:08,110
Yes, seven affirmative zero negative emotion passes to three to 049 offered by Councilor Collins, the result the Metro City Council publicize that increase snap payments known as snap emergency allotments will expire on March 2

2025
02:37:08,857 --> 02:37:10,778
and benefits will decrease for all recipients.

2026
02:37:10,978 --> 02:37:14,979
More information and resources are available at mass.gov slash extra COVID snap.

2027
02:37:15,459 --> 02:37:24,182
Recipients may qualify for new increases to snap benefits based on medical costs or rent expenses and can contact the Department of Transitional Assistance for information about their account.

2028
02:37:24,562 --> 02:37:29,064
For the result of the administration share this information via the city's communication channels.

2029
02:37:29,664 --> 02:37:30,224
Councilor Collins.

2030
02:37:31,431 --> 02:37:32,571
Thank you, President Morrell.

2031
02:37:32,611 --> 02:37:38,974
So I wanted to use the council as a forum to make sure that as many Medford residents as possible heard about this upcoming change.

2032
02:37:39,954 --> 02:37:43,935
Our nation's leaders have allowed for extra pandemic assistance to expire.

2033
02:37:44,135 --> 02:37:50,718
So on March 3rd, every household that's currently using SNAP can expect to start receiving at least 95 fewer dollars a month.

2034
02:37:51,918 --> 02:37:56,480
This is potentially very damaging to households, especially as cost of living and cost of food remains high.

2035
02:37:57,245 --> 02:38:02,627
and local governments have been asked to help get the word out so people can prepare as best they can to fill the gap.

2036
02:38:04,027 --> 02:38:13,170
Residents are encouraged to contact the Department of Transitional Assistance for more information about how they will specifically be affected to see if they can qualify for those new increases.

2037
02:38:13,630 --> 02:38:18,332
And I did hear from the City's Director of Communications today that the City of Medford is planning to broadcast

2038
02:38:18,832 --> 02:38:22,675
this information and those links to resources on the city website and social media channels.

2039
02:38:22,695 --> 02:38:34,545
So to residents who are looking for those details about how to investigate this further and look into resources that they and their households can potentially use, I would counsel them to be on the lookout for that.

2040
02:38:34,885 --> 02:38:35,205
Thank you.

2041
02:38:37,908 --> 02:38:38,608
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

2042
02:38:38,668 --> 02:38:39,789
And I did see a Facebook.

2043
02:38:39,829 --> 02:38:41,370
I mean, I know there's many other communication channels.

2044
02:38:41,410 --> 02:38:45,053
I did see a Facebook post from the city about this either today or yesterday.

2045
02:38:46,495 --> 02:38:47,836
Any further discussion from the council?

2046
02:38:49,022 --> 02:38:50,403
Second Councilor Sang, I do three.

2047
02:38:50,983 --> 02:38:52,484
Matthew Page-Lieberman with their hand up.

2048
02:38:55,105 --> 02:39:03,649
Yeah, I'm on SNAP and I am aware of this upcoming, it's a return to the levels from before the pandemic.

2049
02:39:03,669 --> 02:39:07,191
So I'm really, really happy that Councilor Collins is talking about this.

2050
02:39:07,611 --> 02:39:13,554
Also, I have, I'm just a single person and I've rarely got to the grocery store.

2051
02:39:13,574 --> 02:39:14,615
So during this pandemic,

2052
02:39:15,233 --> 02:39:17,657
I've actually accumulated a lot of snap credit.

2053
02:39:18,418 --> 02:39:29,996
And if there's anybody in the audience that could ever, you know, quite a lot of money in my snap account, if there's anybody in the audience who could ever use help with groceries, let me know and I'll buy them.

2054
02:39:30,736 --> 02:39:31,176
from this.

2055
02:39:31,336 --> 02:39:32,277
It's totally legal.

2056
02:39:32,317 --> 02:39:33,157
You can totally do that.

2057
02:39:33,917 --> 02:39:36,098
I'm not going to get my information out online.

2058
02:39:36,138 --> 02:39:44,202
But if anybody, if you if you're watching at home, if you could contact maybe Councilor Collins, I don't know what your K with you or one of the other counselors just, you know, pastor information.

2059
02:39:44,562 --> 02:39:48,063
And, you know, I could, you know, we could go to the grocery store.

2060
02:39:48,363 --> 02:39:53,125
Just let me know, because there are people that are also hungry and I have the resources that I need.

2061
02:39:53,285 --> 02:39:57,607
So if anybody needs groceries, please tell somebody and we could see what we can do.

2062
02:39:57,627 --> 02:39:59,288
Thank you.

2063
02:39:59,864 --> 02:40:02,605
Love to see mutual aid infiltrate the council chambers.

2064
02:40:02,625 --> 02:40:02,925
Thank you.

2065
02:40:03,666 --> 02:40:04,346
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

2066
02:40:04,366 --> 02:40:06,707
So on the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Sang.

2067
02:40:07,247 --> 02:40:08,508
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2068
02:40:13,330 --> 02:40:15,751
Yes.

2069
02:40:15,951 --> 02:40:16,171
Yes.

2070
02:40:18,552 --> 02:40:18,853
Yes.

2071
02:40:21,454 --> 02:40:22,814
Yes.

2072
02:40:23,835 --> 02:40:24,055
Yes.

2073
02:40:25,796 --> 02:40:25,996
Yes.

2074
02:40:26,156 --> 02:40:28,657
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

2075
02:40:29,913 --> 02:40:43,263
23-050 offered by Councilor Collins and Vice President Behrs, be it resolved that the Medford City Council express its support of HD-2091 and SD-761 and act relative to payments and move taxation by organization exempt from the property tax.

2076
02:40:44,223 --> 02:40:53,090
Be it further resolved that the City Clerk forward a copy of this resolution to the Medford Legislative Delegation as well as House Speaker Mariano and Senate President Spilka.

2077
02:40:54,771 --> 02:40:55,312
Councilor Collins.

2078
02:40:56,192 --> 02:40:57,032
Thank you, President Morrell.

2079
02:40:57,792 --> 02:41:02,374
This council has talked about similar legislation in previous sessions.

2080
02:41:02,694 --> 02:41:15,137
The current pilot program statewide still exempts wealthy nonprofits like universities from paying taxes, property taxes, and that short changes cities like ours from much needed, fairly deserved tax revenue.

2081
02:41:16,398 --> 02:41:23,300
These are not the shoestring kind of nonprofits that probably the word comes to mind with these.

2082
02:41:24,198 --> 02:41:37,644
high wealth nonprofits that are property tax exempt, their revenue is increasing, their endowments are often quite large, and it's not logical for them to be exempt from paying taxes to their host communities, something that every other resident and type of business is required to do.

2083
02:41:39,505 --> 02:41:45,107
So this proposed legislation would be to change the existing law to make large nonprofits

2084
02:41:45,717 --> 02:41:49,198
no longer able to pay taxes or compensation on a purely voluntary basis.

2085
02:41:49,839 --> 02:41:57,542
And so I asked my colleagues for their support for this bill, which would make larger organizations, sorry, large organizations start paying their fair share.

2086
02:41:57,582 --> 02:42:08,526
And I think we can all imagine the very material ways that recouping some of that lost revenue from large nonprofits like Tufts University and my Alma mater, how big of a difference that would make in our community.

2087
02:42:08,646 --> 02:42:08,946
Thank you.

2088
02:42:09,847 --> 02:42:10,627
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

2089
02:42:10,667 --> 02:42:11,247
Vice President Behrs.

2090
02:42:11,647 --> 02:42:12,648
Thank you, Madam President.

2091
02:42:12,668 --> 02:42:14,549
Thank you, Councilor Collins for sponsoring this.

2092
02:42:16,156 --> 02:42:22,082
I believe, I can't remember which one of us did it last time, but it was me.

2093
02:42:23,283 --> 02:42:25,225
You know, I think you made really great points.

2094
02:42:25,686 --> 02:42:29,790
Something that we did two years ago is we were able to look at assessor data at the City of Medford.

2095
02:42:30,590 --> 02:42:33,894
And if Tufts, just Tufts for example, was taxed at the same rate as

2096
02:42:35,945 --> 02:42:37,226
was taxed at all for property taxes.

2097
02:42:37,246 --> 02:42:39,947
They would pay $8 million a year in property taxes.

2098
02:42:41,327 --> 02:42:45,449
Now, this law would only require up to 25% of what they would nominally pay, so it would be about $2 million a year.

2099
02:42:50,751 --> 02:42:53,054
But I just want to say since we've had the discussions here tonight.

2100
02:42:53,634 --> 02:43:09,853
That's $2 million for sidewalk crew to support our firefighters to support all the emergency calls that go out to tops to support street and sidewalk infrastructure repairs in their area to support affordable housing in the area around the top neighborhood, and I'm just putting that out there to say.

2101
02:43:11,437 --> 02:43:22,964
I can understand why a nonprofit education or healthcare institution maybe shouldn't be treated the same as a for profit business, but I don't think the answer is that they should be treated, it should be 100% for one and 0% for the other.

2102
02:43:26,420 --> 02:43:28,743
And I also want to put out there to this isn't just about tops.

2103
02:43:29,403 --> 02:43:40,395
This is about all of the large nonprofit institutions, and whether or not they play pay pilot payments to the city tops for example while this legislation would allow basically up to $2 million.

2104
02:43:41,076 --> 02:43:43,759
If they paid normal private tax to be $8 million tops right now pays $450,000 to the city.

2105
02:43:46,321 --> 02:43:54,430
But other pilot agreements such as right across the street from this building, Harvard Vanguard used to pay a trace health whatever it is now.

2106
02:43:55,432 --> 02:44:02,399
They used to pay a pilot agreement and they pulled out of their power agreement unilaterally without any city engagement they no longer provide any.

2107
02:44:03,342 --> 02:44:04,363
pilot payment to the city.

2108
02:44:05,003 --> 02:44:10,828
Something I'm exploring actually is that Atrius Health was just bought up and is now a for-profit institution, so maybe they'll have to start paying.

2109
02:44:11,809 --> 02:44:16,033
But my point is to say that right now, the way that the current state law reads,

2110
02:44:17,116 --> 02:44:18,958
it's up to the discretion of the institution.

2111
02:44:19,919 --> 02:44:26,145
And that means that even if you have an agreement, the institution could pull out at any time and leave the city holding the bag.

2112
02:44:26,505 --> 02:44:34,553
And we're already holding the bag for all the services and needs in the areas around these large institutions that they're not paying their fair share for.

2113
02:44:35,374 --> 02:44:36,716
So I really hope

2114
02:44:38,049 --> 02:44:50,115
that the State House can do something to create a fair system where we're still understanding that these are nonprofit health and education institutions that should have some benefit, but that benefit shouldn't be all or nothing the way it is now.

2115
02:44:51,996 --> 02:45:03,402
And furthermore, just to drive home the point, this is for large property owners, the threshold, your property has to be worth, I believe, over $15 million to even be qualified under this suggested amendment.

2116
02:45:03,422 --> 02:45:05,803
So thank you, Councilor Collins, Madam President.

2117
02:45:05,823 --> 02:45:06,483
Thank you.

2118
02:45:06,703 --> 02:45:07,864
Any further discussion from the Council?

2119
02:45:09,713 --> 02:45:12,296
Going back to Councilor Knight.

2120
02:45:13,197 --> 02:45:14,338
Madam President, thank you very much.

2121
02:45:14,378 --> 02:45:21,848
I think it's just important to point out that these large scale nonprofits like healthcare institutions and universities also provide a great community benefit.

2122
02:45:23,132 --> 02:45:24,873
namely jobs that provide a living wage.

2123
02:45:26,254 --> 02:45:29,795
So we have to also take into consideration the economic benefits that they bring to a community.

2124
02:45:30,635 --> 02:45:37,738
You see communities that have universities located inside them and the benefits that they have economically when the recession hits.

2125
02:45:37,858 --> 02:45:45,822
So I think it's also important to point out the benefits that come along with having large-scale universities and large-scale healthcare institutions in the community that are non-profit as well.

2126
02:45:48,510 --> 02:45:49,610
Thank you.

2127
02:45:49,871 --> 02:45:52,432
Going to Matthew Page-Lieberman.

2128
02:45:57,874 --> 02:46:01,755
It's very, very good that this, you know, this topic about we're essentially talking about pilot that's coming up.

2129
02:46:03,436 --> 02:46:06,537
You know, this has unfortunately been a situation we've been in for quite a few years.

2130
02:46:06,577 --> 02:46:08,878
I know there's a local community organization.

2131
02:46:09,058 --> 02:46:12,159
They wanted me to assist with a pilot initiative they're working on.

2132
02:46:13,059 --> 02:46:14,060
And there was a lot of

2133
02:46:14,744 --> 02:46:21,370
things that kind of happened that it seemed like perhaps that group or whatever wasn't really ready to engage with it.

2134
02:46:21,770 --> 02:46:32,820
But I did, I remember this, I don't know, like this back during the last mayor's administration, I like kind of looked into stuff and talked to the person who's like the person negotiating at the top level.

2135
02:46:33,761 --> 02:46:35,102
And I was following this stuff.

2136
02:46:35,142 --> 02:46:37,904
I believe that Mayor Burke was able to

2137
02:46:39,546 --> 02:46:44,289
kind of get some kind of agreement because, you know, our contract with, I'm just talking about Tufts, it just ended.

2138
02:46:44,770 --> 02:46:50,834
And so my understanding is like, yeah, this was like five years ago or something like this.

2139
02:46:51,915 --> 02:46:54,898
And so Tufts had decided to just end

2140
02:46:55,578 --> 02:47:00,741
I increased the amount of money that they're giving to each community where they have property.

2141
02:47:01,461 --> 02:47:09,466
Nothing that any particular community was able to negotiate, no matter how much property they own, no matter how much students or whatever, they just increased that much money.

2142
02:47:09,526 --> 02:47:14,369
But there was something that was left off the table, which is the kind of services that particularly Tufts offers.

2143
02:47:14,629 --> 02:47:19,672
I know that a lot of times the city likes to have a relationship with interns and stuff like this, what kind of services, like

2144
02:47:19,972 --> 02:47:22,073
I'm in class right now at Tufts, right?

2145
02:47:22,113 --> 02:47:23,033
Because I'm a Medford student.

2146
02:47:23,053 --> 02:47:23,633
I'm not paying.

2147
02:47:23,833 --> 02:47:26,154
They allow that kind of stuff.

2148
02:47:26,174 --> 02:47:27,374
People are in the community.

2149
02:47:28,075 --> 02:47:34,717
But this has unfortunately been a conversation that's been going on for a really long time is that we haven't been able to figure out this agreement.

2150
02:47:35,017 --> 02:47:38,638
And a lot of folks have just been focusing on, well, perhaps we can get some more money out of them.

2151
02:47:38,938 --> 02:47:42,939
But universities provide millions, many, many, many, many resources.

2152
02:47:43,699 --> 02:47:48,641
My understanding is from speaking to somebody recently is that one of the reasons that our mayor

2153
02:47:49,501 --> 02:47:58,049
even though she did have an editorial in Medford Transcript about three years ago when she was running for office.

2154
02:47:58,089 --> 02:48:00,832
It was a list of all these services that TEPs can provide.

2155
02:48:01,272 --> 02:48:05,556
But once the pandemic started hitting, everything had to be moved back.

2156
02:48:05,956 --> 02:48:08,839
This is about, I guess, three years ago, there was going to be a particular meeting.

2157
02:48:10,060 --> 02:48:15,443
for us in City Hall to start having the Tufts discussion, the POD discussion, but it didn't happen.

2158
02:48:16,343 --> 02:48:20,965
And so, you know, recently I've reached out to the mayor again, let's start having that conversation.

2159
02:48:22,066 --> 02:48:25,167
And yeah, I mean, like Councilor Knight was talking about the services.

2160
02:48:25,808 --> 02:48:36,533
One of my understandings is because of the services that Tufts has been providing during this pandemic, we have been kind of, at City Hall, we've been kind of holding off a little bit and pressuring them to this agreement.

2161
02:48:37,833 --> 02:48:54,683
I do completely support any kind of motion to make sure that these universities, these, you know, universities not paying property taxes that have massive amounts of endowments of money that they're sitting on, even when they are paying living wages, they're still sitting on a lot of money.

2162
02:48:55,123 --> 02:48:56,543
They own buildings, right?

2163
02:48:56,643 --> 02:49:00,925
Many of these buildings are not providing housing for the people outside of the university community.

2164
02:49:01,225 --> 02:49:13,088
There's a lot of stuff we can kind of consider here and can we kind of negotiate, you know, these financial resources that we do need, especially when we have counselors that are worried that we're going to go like in the red.

2165
02:49:13,715 --> 02:49:17,016
You know, they have the, but beyond that, I'm gonna cut it short.

2166
02:49:17,276 --> 02:49:30,461
There are massive amount of services that the universities can be providing as well that a lot of times we do not consider as far as the intellectual services they can provide for creating really new projects, new projects in this community.

2167
02:49:30,621 --> 02:49:32,702
And I will not go into it, but really new, new projects.

2168
02:49:33,002 --> 02:49:36,743
And I would invite anybody for us all to have the kind of conversation.

2169
02:49:36,963 --> 02:49:39,344
And we should be having conversations with Tufts.

2170
02:49:39,924 --> 02:49:47,250
about those kinds of new projects and collaboration that we can be involved in, rather than saying, will you do this for us and will you do that for us?

2171
02:49:47,470 --> 02:49:47,810
Thank you.

2172
02:49:47,830 --> 02:49:50,212
Thank you.

2173
02:49:51,933 --> 02:49:52,634
I'll be very brief.

2174
02:49:53,414 --> 02:49:58,779
William Navarro, 108 Bedford Street, apartment 1B, is basically very similar to what I said last time this came up.

2175
02:49:58,899 --> 02:50:03,082
One of the big concerns about Tufts, they're buying up a lot of land specifically.

2176
02:50:03,102 --> 02:50:04,763
They're potentially crowding out others.

2177
02:50:05,804 --> 02:50:08,866
Taxing the land they own as heavily as possible would help discourage that.

2178
02:50:09,867 --> 02:50:14,691
Obviously, to balance that out, we'd want to tax their improvements as lightly as possible.

2179
02:50:14,731 --> 02:50:17,113
We don't want to discourage them investing in the community.

2180
02:50:17,933 --> 02:50:20,815
I hope that that's a structure that we could consider at some point.

2181
02:50:20,936 --> 02:50:25,599
I hope council, when it finds the opportunity, can support a scheme like that.

2182
02:50:25,759 --> 02:50:26,059
Thank you.

2183
02:50:27,020 --> 02:50:27,981
Point of information, Madam President.

2184
02:50:29,162 --> 02:50:29,582
Councilor Knight.

2185
02:50:30,303 --> 02:50:38,429
I do believe the city and Tufts University have an agreement where all new purchases of parcels outside the campus, the existing campus, would be put on the tax rolls.

2186
02:50:40,767 --> 02:50:41,348
Thank you for that.

2187
02:50:42,789 --> 02:50:51,256
On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Vice President Behrs, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2188
02:50:53,038 --> 02:50:53,238
Yes.

2189
02:50:55,159 --> 02:51:00,324
No.

2190
02:51:01,945 --> 02:51:03,506
Yes.

2191
02:51:03,827 --> 02:51:04,027
Yes.

2192
02:51:04,287 --> 02:51:06,609
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes.

2193
02:51:08,299 --> 02:51:10,160
23-051 offered by Councilor Collins and President Morrell.

2194
02:51:10,380 --> 02:51:20,583
Be it resolved that the City Council request an update from the administration on the status of Medford's allocation from the Commonwealth's opioid litigation settlement proceeds in light of the five additional proposed national settlements.

2195
02:51:21,184 --> 02:51:33,428
Be it further resolved that the administration confirm whether the required state subdivision agreement has been submitted to the Attorney General to render Medford eligible to receive an increased allocation from the municipal settlement proceeds.

2196
02:51:33,728 --> 02:51:34,348
Councilor Collins.

2197
02:51:36,547 --> 02:51:39,128
Thank you, President Morrell, and thank you for co-sponsoring this.

2198
02:51:39,708 --> 02:51:45,111
This is pertaining to the National Opioid Settlements against the manufacturers and distributors of opioid painkillers.

2199
02:51:46,251 --> 02:52:01,018
Late last year, it was announced that five additional settlements were reached with more opioid distributors, and states and cities are being allocated funds to go towards prevention and community-wide rehabilitation as resulting from the national opioid epidemic.

2200
02:52:02,305 --> 02:52:08,110
The council did actually receive an update from Director of Communications earlier today with some good news.

2201
02:52:08,170 --> 02:52:25,608
We are confirmed to receive a distribution as a result of this settlement and our Board of Health and Office of Prevention Department staff has already been anticipating the five additional settlements, which is to say the city is on top of it.

2202
02:52:26,611 --> 02:52:27,812
which is great to hear.

2203
02:52:27,852 --> 02:52:28,793
I'm grateful to hear that.

2204
02:52:30,034 --> 02:52:46,147
And just to share with the community, the update that we received, which I think was also disseminated early December, these funds can be used for sort of pertinent uses such as opioid use disorder treatment, support for people in recovery, harm reduction, prevention of opioid misuse.

2205
02:52:46,387 --> 02:52:51,912
And the city has a number of next steps that they'll be conducting community outreach about.

2206
02:52:52,612 --> 02:53:01,139
including establishing a promote prevent support behavioral health commission, um, feedback and listening sessions with the community.

2207
02:53:02,060 --> 02:53:10,227
And the city council will be hearing more about, um, the specific plan and role of that commission as it gets formed over the next year.

2208
02:53:11,068 --> 02:53:11,948
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

2209
02:53:12,009 --> 02:53:12,149
Yeah.

2210
02:53:12,189 --> 02:53:13,970
And just I appreciate you sharing that update.

2211
02:53:13,990 --> 02:53:20,856
And just to add to that, the information, um, that you just referenced, the update can be found on the health department's website on the city website.

2212
02:53:21,348 --> 02:53:25,312
under opioid settlement information and there's a drop down right there with some links as well.

2213
02:53:25,913 --> 02:53:27,294
Councilor Knight.

2214
02:53:27,334 --> 02:53:28,515
Madam President, thank you very much.

2215
02:53:29,870 --> 02:53:33,132
I'd be remiss if we didn't recognize our colleague, Councilor Caviello.

2216
02:53:33,713 --> 02:53:39,597
It was Councilor Caviello's resolution under the Burke administration that got us involved in the opioid lawsuit.

2217
02:53:40,397 --> 02:53:44,640
And without his foresight and vision, we wouldn't be here today receiving these funds.

2218
02:53:45,141 --> 02:53:56,629
So I'd like to thank him for taking the opportunity to be invested in the war on recovery here in our city and the steps that he took to make sure that we received these funds.

2219
02:53:58,663 --> 02:53:59,343
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

2220
02:53:59,383 --> 02:54:00,364
Thank you, Councilor Carviello.

2221
02:54:01,205 --> 02:54:01,805
Vice-Mayor Behrs.

2222
02:54:02,205 --> 02:54:03,066
Thank you, Madam President.

2223
02:54:03,306 --> 02:54:06,108
Thank you to my fellow councilors, Councilor Carviello.

2224
02:54:06,748 --> 02:54:19,276
And I just wanted to also shout out Director of Prevention and Outreach, Penny Funiol, and also Alicia Lundgren, our social worker, who I believe has a presentation around this that's on the city website that President Burrell referenced, so thank you.

2225
02:54:19,877 --> 02:54:20,657
Thank you, Vice-Mayor Behrs.

2226
02:54:21,598 --> 02:54:24,460
On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by... Second.

2227
02:54:24,940 --> 02:54:26,461
Councilor Sang, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2228
02:54:35,384 --> 02:54:35,604
Yes.

2229
02:54:37,705 --> 02:54:38,025
Yes.

2230
02:54:40,745 --> 02:54:41,185
Yes.

2231
02:54:41,205 --> 02:54:41,505
Yes.

2232
02:54:42,746 --> 02:54:59,590
Yes, seven the inferno zero in the negative passes to 3.05 to offer by Vice President bears be resolved by the city council that appendix A of the city of Medford code of ordinances be amended to include the following section 9.2 plan development districts.

2233
02:55:01,886 --> 02:55:22,516
blank plan development district per square foot area above 5,000 square feet of construction regardless of use amount of 5 cents and section these revised ordinances is 94 dash 9.2 and this is the plan development district fee that has been discussed in at least two committee meetings reported out.

2234
02:55:23,516 --> 02:55:24,136
This is embarrassing.

2235
02:55:24,837 --> 02:55:25,457
Yeah, that's it.

2236
02:55:25,477 --> 02:55:27,538
This is just us putting the fee of

2237
02:55:28,717 --> 02:55:35,545
five cents per five for each square foot, about 5,000 square feet as a fee for plan development district applications into the code of ordinance.

2238
02:55:35,585 --> 02:55:37,226
So I would move to approve for first reading.

2239
02:55:39,169 --> 02:55:45,636
On the emotion of our bears to first reading seconded by Councillor Collins, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2240
02:56:00,580 --> 02:56:00,880
Yes.

2241
02:56:04,482 --> 02:56:04,762
Yes.

2242
02:56:06,423 --> 02:56:23,972
Yes, 70 in front of zero in the negative the motion passes for first reading to three s 053 offer by Councilor saying the result of the city administration provider for updating the city council on its progress on the social justice roadmap via for the result of the city administration update the roadmap were labeled and deemed appropriate Councilor saying.

2243
02:56:24,812 --> 02:56:25,913
Thank you, President Morrell.

2244
02:56:26,694 --> 02:56:29,196
Well, I guess there's a small typo in here.

2245
02:56:29,216 --> 02:56:32,358
I would just amend it to strike labeled and.

2246
02:56:34,639 --> 02:56:48,191
This is one of three resolutions I have on the agenda tonight that are in the spirit of Black History Month and having gone to a few of the city's events, you know, a recurring theme is what can we do to advance social justice and racial justice in Medford?

2247
02:56:48,211 --> 02:56:57,419
And what can we do as a city government to meet the high standards that we're setting for ourselves and to listen to our residents?

2248
02:56:58,500 --> 02:56:58,640
And

2249
02:56:59,696 --> 02:57:14,901
A few years ago, our city published a social justice roadmap, which detailed a bunch of steps that our administration and our city would take to even out the scales and to pursue a policy of equity in the city.

2250
02:57:16,381 --> 02:57:27,405
And I think it's been about three years since the last update, and I've worked with the diversity director to kind of put this on an agenda and to kind of just

2251
02:57:29,991 --> 02:57:39,435
talk to the administration a little bit and ask for an update and to ask for updated steps about what action steps we still need to do to reach those lofty goals.

2252
02:57:40,396 --> 02:57:41,136
Thank you, Councilor Seng.

2253
02:57:41,236 --> 02:57:42,357
Any further discussion from the Council?

2254
02:57:42,677 --> 02:57:43,297
Vice-President Behrs.

2255
02:57:43,617 --> 02:57:44,297
Thank you, Madam President.

2256
02:57:44,337 --> 02:57:45,858
I would just add to Councilor Seng's point.

2257
02:57:45,918 --> 02:57:48,339
I think he already made it, but I'm just kind of reiterating it.

2258
02:57:48,879 --> 02:57:53,782
When we have plans and we have hopes and approaches,

2259
02:57:54,926 --> 02:57:59,748
I think the place where the city falls down after that is milestones and goals and checking in.

2260
02:58:00,088 --> 02:58:04,629
And I think this is a request for that on the social justice roadmap that's much needed.

2261
02:58:04,709 --> 02:58:07,450
So thank you, Councilor Seng.

2262
02:58:07,810 --> 02:58:08,530
Thank you, Vice Mayor.

2263
02:58:08,570 --> 02:58:13,892
Councilor Seng, going back to your amendment, is this just saying like, in that last sentence, we're labeled just getting rid of the one hand?

2264
02:58:13,912 --> 02:58:14,632
Yeah, just get rid of it.

2265
02:58:14,692 --> 02:58:16,933
It is the clerk's opinion that it doesn't need to be amended.

2266
02:58:16,953 --> 02:58:19,674
It's just a- Oh, perfect.

2267
02:58:19,914 --> 02:58:20,454
Scrivener's error.

2268
02:58:22,812 --> 02:58:29,573
So, on the motion of cancer saying second by cancer Scarpelli Mr. Please call the role.

2269
02:58:32,934 --> 02:58:33,234
Yes.

2270
02:58:34,274 --> 02:58:36,675
Yes.

2271
02:58:36,795 --> 02:58:38,495
Yes.

2272
02:58:39,095 --> 02:58:39,415
Yes.

2273
02:58:41,756 --> 02:58:41,996
Yes.

2274
02:58:42,596 --> 02:58:42,856
Yes.

2275
02:58:43,296 --> 02:58:44,216
Yes.

2276
02:58:44,636 --> 02:58:49,317
Yes, seven the affirmative zero negative emotion passes to three dash 054 offered by cancer saying

2277
02:58:49,790 --> 02:58:54,415
Be it resolved the city council asked the city administration to conduct an updated racial equity study.

2278
02:58:55,176 --> 02:58:55,576
Thank you.

2279
02:58:55,837 --> 02:58:57,679
This one is slightly different.

2280
02:58:57,759 --> 02:59:05,948
Having talked with the diversity director feels that this is something that is standard and different municipalities that we don't miss, we haven't necessarily done here.

2281
02:59:06,808 --> 02:59:19,792
It will require not a dramatic increase increase of resources but a little bit of help up her end, which is why I'm passing this resolution from the city council side showing that there's support for me here is important.

2282
02:59:20,533 --> 02:59:26,295
Again, it's not something that would really take that much more money it's just, it's just something that.

2283
02:59:27,395 --> 02:59:33,176
we again need to poke the administration a little bit and to get them to try to do.

2284
02:59:33,736 --> 02:59:40,097
The main difference between a racial equity study and a social justice roadmap is social justice roadmap is much broader.

2285
02:59:40,117 --> 02:59:47,379
It lays, as many have read the document, lays out general steps and policies that we need to consider.

2286
02:59:47,639 --> 02:59:53,340
The racial equity study is looking more at this very specific topic and looking at what

2287
02:59:54,560 --> 03:00:06,209
what data we need to collect, what actions we need to take within City Hall to make a better environment for our staff, very specific, very concrete, much narrower actions.

2288
03:00:07,350 --> 03:00:08,130
Thank you, Councilor Seng.

2289
03:00:08,631 --> 03:00:09,351
Any further discussion?

2290
03:00:10,772 --> 03:00:13,734
On the motion of Councilor Seng, seconded by Vice President Paris.

2291
03:00:13,754 --> 03:00:14,835
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2292
03:00:18,338 --> 03:00:18,438
Yes.

2293
03:00:28,319 --> 03:00:28,479
Yes.

2294
03:00:29,721 --> 03:00:41,734
Yes, seven the in front of us here that I get the motion passes to three dash 055 offered by cancer saying it resolved the subcommittee on racial justice disabilities and elder affairs consider a welcoming city ordinance cancer site.

2295
03:00:42,056 --> 03:00:42,456
Thank you.

2296
03:00:42,636 --> 03:00:58,164
This one sounds a bit more ambitious than it actually is really what this is is codifying are the legal language we already have right now city policy regarding interactions with immigrants and our non cooperation policy with ice.

2297
03:00:58,844 --> 03:01:03,986
This is something that the police department already backs already has legal language from our past solicitors on.

2298
03:01:05,874 --> 03:01:24,335
This, this is really more about starting the process because a lot of, in particular, Latino and Haitian residents have reached out to me, and to see staff here, afraid to really engage with city services because they don't know if how they're

2299
03:01:25,436 --> 03:01:28,321
know the repercussions of engaging with the city government.

2300
03:01:29,582 --> 03:01:35,491
We know that it's safe for them, but this is something that could be used to

2301
03:01:37,389 --> 03:01:44,492
to get the word out that it is safe for them, to guarantee them their rights and safety in our community.

2302
03:01:45,053 --> 03:01:52,256
And some residents have come up to me with the worry that because it is policy, it could change at any point in the future.

2303
03:01:53,396 --> 03:02:05,322
Whereas if we codify it right now, even just the language that we have written and approved, that would mean a lot to them and mean a lot for them to feel safe about engaging city services.

2304
03:02:05,922 --> 03:02:08,646
So again, this is not something that's meant to be very ambitious.

2305
03:02:08,706 --> 03:02:14,593
This is something that's meant to take the legal language we have right now that we're enforcing right now, put it into our code.

2306
03:02:15,254 --> 03:02:15,955
Thank you, Councilor Seng.

2307
03:02:16,856 --> 03:02:17,396
Councilor Collins.

2308
03:02:18,418 --> 03:02:20,961
Well, I thank Councilor Seng for putting this forward.

2309
03:02:20,981 --> 03:02:24,365
I think this is a clear example where, you know,

2310
03:02:25,011 --> 03:02:27,452
words matter and formalizing the right policy matters.

2311
03:02:27,552 --> 03:02:53,877
And I think it's, you know, a really, it puts our community in a very positive, strong light that this is a policy that our city staff are already carrying out and what we can do as a legislative body to make sure that we are using our power as a forum and a speaker box for the community to make sure that it's known to as many communities as possible, sorry, as many constituents as possible, that interfacing with any city department

2312
03:02:54,847 --> 03:03:01,748
regardless of your immigration status, is a good thing to do, a safe thing to do, and that they can trust the outcomes of that interaction.

2313
03:03:01,788 --> 03:03:06,349
I think that codifying this formally will help us just promulgate that to more of the community.

2314
03:03:07,110 --> 03:03:09,130
And so I'm happy to support this tonight.

2315
03:03:09,170 --> 03:03:09,450
Thank you.

2316
03:03:10,050 --> 03:03:10,870
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

2317
03:03:11,370 --> 03:03:12,931
Any further discussion from the Council?

2318
03:03:13,491 --> 03:03:14,111
Councilor Saik?

2319
03:03:14,251 --> 03:03:19,332
I did forget to note that this is something that the Diversity Director and I have been working on as well.

2320
03:03:20,072 --> 03:03:22,193
Thank you, Councilor Saik.

2321
03:03:22,793 --> 03:03:23,233
Councilor Cohen?

2322
03:03:24,383 --> 03:03:28,666
Okay, on the motion of Councilor Sang, seconded by Councilor Collins.

2323
03:03:28,686 --> 03:03:29,687
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2324
03:03:31,648 --> 03:03:31,808
Yes.

2325
03:03:31,828 --> 03:03:31,908
Yes.

2326
03:03:53,796 --> 03:03:56,017
Six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent.

2327
03:03:57,398 --> 03:03:58,958
Going now to public participation.

2328
03:03:58,978 --> 03:04:01,119
Are there any members of the public who would like to speak?

2329
03:04:01,239 --> 03:04:04,641
Understanding we have one remaining paper that we'll keep on for our next regular meeting.

2330
03:04:08,382 --> 03:04:09,783
Councilor Kerrio, seeing none.

2331
03:04:09,883 --> 03:04:10,463
Councilor Kerrio.

2332
03:04:10,523 --> 03:04:18,387
Before we adjourn, one month ago, I put something on the agenda with regards to the fountain of the Crystal Canyon Peace Guiding over there.

2333
03:04:19,982 --> 03:04:24,386
It's now March and it's the 10th anniversary of that tragedy.

2334
03:04:24,406 --> 03:04:32,694
I haven't seen the paper back on what I did receive something from, because we do have money in a trust.

2335
03:04:33,454 --> 03:04:34,015
They fixed that.

2336
03:04:37,850 --> 03:04:42,852
They were waiting for a piece spent George but three years with that piece very important piece of three years.

2337
03:04:43,872 --> 03:04:48,074
We've been waiting for that piece.

2338
03:04:48,514 --> 03:04:49,494
The fire truck.

2339
03:04:49,894 --> 03:04:53,715
Yes, I don't know what piece you're waiting for me to say you've been waiting for that piece of three years.

2340
03:04:53,735 --> 03:04:57,877
You know the celebration is in a few in a few weeks.

2341
03:04:58,717 --> 03:04:59,117
I mean it's.

2342
03:05:01,279 --> 03:05:05,502
The seniors are really enjoying sitting out there during the summer, but like I said, it's the 10th anniversary.

2343
03:05:05,822 --> 03:05:11,646
Be ashamed if that fountain isn't up and going, especially where we have the money in the trust fund, they'll pay for that.

2344
03:05:12,306 --> 03:05:13,507
Thank you, I can follow up on that.

2345
03:05:15,348 --> 03:05:17,690
Great, do I have a motion to adjourn?

2346
03:05:18,571 --> 03:05:21,413
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Seng.

2347
03:05:21,493 --> 03:05:22,734

2348

03:05:35,357 --> 03:05:37,481
Councilor San Buenaventura.

2350
03:05:37,501 --> 03:05:37,561
Yes.

2351
03:05:37,581 --> 03:05:38,723
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

2352
03:05:38,743 --> 03:05:39,284
Motion passes.

2353
03:05:39,324 --> 03:05:39,825
