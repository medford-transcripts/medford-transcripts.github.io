[SPEAKER_15]: Vice President Marks?

12
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:29,798
[SPEAKER_15]: Present.

13
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,159
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Scott Pelli?

14
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:31,639
[SPEAKER_15]: Present.

15
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,860
[SPEAKER_13]: President Caviello?

16
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:33,801
[SPEAKER_13]: Present.

17
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:36,002
[SPEAKER_13]: Please rise and salute the flag.

18
00:02:52,730 --> 00:03:07,591
[SPEAKER_13]: 17-419 offered by Vice President Michael Mox, accommodation for Mae Marbrek, 25 years of recognition as founder and member of the Friends of Chevalier and Jean Mack Gym.

19
00:03:08,192 --> 00:03:09,073
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Mox.

20
00:03:33,506 --> 00:03:34,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

21
00:03:34,307 --> 00:03:40,634
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an honor and a pleasure to represent this council accommodation to

22
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:44,268
[SPEAKER_09]: what I refer to as a dear friend of mine for a number of years.

23
00:03:45,189 --> 00:03:54,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I met may probably back some, and I don't want to date you may, uh, back some 25 years ago, um, through different city organizations.

24
00:03:55,574 --> 00:04:02,497
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, I think it's only appropriate after all these years and all the different organizations that may as belong to,

25
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:10,224
[SPEAKER_09]: that she received the recognition, not that she'd want, because May, if you know May, May never looks for recognition.

26
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:19,652
[SPEAKER_09]: May's always behind the scenes, she's the engine driving what goes on in this community, and never once looked for any type of praise or accolades.

27
00:04:20,212 --> 00:04:27,919
[SPEAKER_09]: And even tonight, I wanna thank Council President Caviello for making the phone call to say, hey May, can you come down to Tuesday's meeting?

28
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:28,840
[SPEAKER_09]: Multiple phone calls.

29
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,961
[SPEAKER_09]: Multiple phone calls.

30
00:04:31,195 --> 00:04:32,696
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you come down to Tuesday's meeting?

31
00:04:33,056 --> 00:04:36,539
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think May may have had an idea or not, I'm not quite sure.

32
00:04:37,219 --> 00:04:54,172
[SPEAKER_09]: But needless to say, I would at this point, I'd like to recognize, I served the last few years on the board of directors of the Friends of Chevalier and GMAC Gymnasium, alongside May and a number of other real activists in the community.

33
00:04:54,812 --> 00:05:00,056
[SPEAKER_09]: And at this point, I would just like to recognize the board in which we sat on

34
00:05:00,747 --> 00:05:02,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Cindy Watson, Co-President.

35
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:04,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Mike Cerullo, Co-President.

36
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:08,053
[SPEAKER_09]: Keith Barry, Member of the Board.

37
00:05:08,754 --> 00:05:10,495
[SPEAKER_09]: Representative Paul Donato, Member of the Board.

38
00:05:11,056 --> 00:05:12,937
[SPEAKER_09]: Susan Fairchild, Member of the Board.

39
00:05:13,538 --> 00:05:15,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Ken Kraus, Member of the Board.

40
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:17,781
[SPEAKER_09]: May Makibrek, Member of the Board.

41
00:05:18,282 --> 00:05:21,985
[SPEAKER_09]: And Russ Rossetti, Member of the Friends of Chevalier Board of Directors.

42
00:05:22,825 --> 00:05:28,410
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, May, little known fact, was a Mustang Hall of Famer.

43
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Back some years ago.

44
00:05:30,761 --> 00:05:31,161
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, May?

45
00:05:31,882 --> 00:05:32,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Where is May?

46
00:05:32,562 --> 00:05:33,063
[SPEAKER_09]: May, where are you?

47
00:05:33,443 --> 00:05:34,224
[SPEAKER_09]: You're up over here.

48
00:05:35,805 --> 00:05:38,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Mustang Hall of Famer.

49
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:42,550
[SPEAKER_09]: May was the founding member of the Friends of Chevalier and Gene Mack Gymnasium.

50
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:44,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Caché.

51
00:05:45,132 --> 00:05:55,700
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the brainchild of May, meeting with a few people in the community regarding the arts, that put together Caché, the Coalition for Art, Culture, and Healthy Economy.

52
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,602
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, May won't say it, but

53
00:05:59,438 --> 00:06:12,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Those were May's ideas originally back many, many years ago to put organizations together, to link the community up, and pull in all different backgrounds in order to move this community forward.

54
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:22,273
[SPEAKER_09]: While promoting the arts is a main goal of CACHE, it also aims to bolster the local economy at the same time.

55
00:06:22,794 --> 00:06:28,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Looking ahead, we are hoping to create a more vibrant arts and cultural scene in Method, which in turn

56
00:06:29,374 --> 00:06:32,316
[SPEAKER_09]: will promote economic development, May Makibrek said.

57
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:38,360
[SPEAKER_09]: That part of it cannot be overlooked, and it is what we feel sets the group apart.

58
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:44,544
[SPEAKER_09]: We all work together as equals, with one big exception, John Anderson said.

59
00:06:45,464 --> 00:06:52,149
[SPEAKER_09]: May Makibrek is really the driving force, and she has been so enthusiastic and youthful and full of ideas.

60
00:06:52,589 --> 00:06:58,213
[SPEAKER_09]: You need a person like that if a coalition such as this has any chance of surviving, which it is.

61
00:06:59,238 --> 00:07:00,599
[SPEAKER_09]: a good sign for us.

62
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:05,081
[SPEAKER_09]: May served as the president of Springstep.

63
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:12,004
[SPEAKER_09]: She also served on the board of directors for Brooks Estates Land Trust.

64
00:07:13,245 --> 00:07:17,007
[SPEAKER_09]: May was recognized by the Chamber of Commerce as Citizen of the Year.

65
00:07:18,683 --> 00:07:39,629
[SPEAKER_09]: Who can forget May's article, which appeared in the March 14, 2014 edition of the Method transcript, honoring Method Olympic champion Mary Carew Armstrong for National Women's History Month, or the countless letters to the editor in which May offered support to local organizations.

66
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:47,472
[SPEAKER_09]: As we all know, May was part of a lot of different civic groups, but she was also very vocal on the issues.

67
00:07:48,612 --> 00:07:52,135
[SPEAKER_09]: And May, she wasn't a wallflower.

68
00:07:52,315 --> 00:07:53,495
[SPEAKER_09]: She let it be known.

69
00:07:54,176 --> 00:07:56,177
[SPEAKER_09]: She let it be known where she stood in an issue.

70
00:07:57,038 --> 00:08:03,963
[SPEAKER_09]: And if there was an issue that was confronting the residents of this community, you better believe May was at that podium.

71
00:08:05,044 --> 00:08:09,127
[SPEAKER_09]: I remember the night the Medford Public Library was experiencing roof leaks.

72
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:11,128
[SPEAKER_09]: And guess who was at the podium?

73
00:08:12,852 --> 00:08:30,163
[SPEAKER_09]: We have very, very dedicated people who are here tonight, members of the staff of the library, just hoping that the ceiling tiles in the building that they're working wouldn't fall in on their head, said May Makibrek, president of the Method Coalition for the Arts, at the council meeting.

74
00:08:30,643 --> 00:08:31,604
[SPEAKER_09]: This is disgraceful.

75
00:08:34,026 --> 00:08:37,488
[SPEAKER_09]: We often remember the debate with art funding in the budget.

76
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,850
[SPEAKER_09]: The city never funded arts in the budget, and a few years ago,

77
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:46,837
[SPEAKER_09]: this council offered a resolution to put arts in the budget, and May was at the podium once again.

78
00:08:47,437 --> 00:08:51,320
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's fair to say we're in an arts revolution, said May Makibrek.

79
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,701
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford has changed.

80
00:08:53,121 --> 00:08:55,083
[SPEAKER_09]: We are no longer a streetcar suburb.

81
00:08:55,623 --> 00:08:56,884
[SPEAKER_09]: We're a vibrant community.

82
00:08:57,384 --> 00:09:02,608
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a great deal to offer, and there is an arts movement going on at the present time.

83
00:09:05,528 --> 00:09:09,391
[SPEAKER_09]: Several years back, we had the Brooks Estates bond proposal that was before us.

84
00:09:09,971 --> 00:09:11,973
[SPEAKER_09]: Quite a contentious issue for some.

85
00:09:13,114 --> 00:09:14,955
[SPEAKER_09]: May, again, was at the podium.

86
00:09:15,476 --> 00:09:21,260
[SPEAKER_09]: The Brooks Estates has been treated by the city like an orphan, said Medford resident, May Marky-Brick.

87
00:09:23,401 --> 00:09:27,805
[SPEAKER_09]: In 2010, community leaders were pushing to build up the Chevalier Theater.

88
00:09:28,978 --> 00:09:52,745
[SPEAKER_09]: May stated, now that the problem is not so much the condition of the theater, which like any property requires ongoing maintenance, but the underutilization of the Chevalier Theater, she said, how much longer are we going to talk, continue to see a valuable asset in our community be underutilized, and waste the opportunity to have Chevalier Theater become an engine of economic development in Meffitt Square?

89
00:09:55,283 --> 00:10:09,467
[SPEAKER_09]: These are just a few of the things that I recall May working on over the years as a community activist, as someone who wholeheartedly cared about the children of this community.

90
00:10:09,828 --> 00:10:17,690
[SPEAKER_09]: You couldn't find anyone more responsive to the needs of the Boys and Girls Club, which is on Forest Street, than May.

91
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:23,532
[SPEAKER_09]: The arts movement, I think, May was the art movement for a number of years.

92
00:10:27,597 --> 00:10:51,296
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's only appropriate tonight that we take the time to, and I see this audience is filled, it's not many times that this audience gets filled, and it's my distinct honor and pleasure to thank my friend, May Makibrek, for her many years of dedicated service, and I know some members of the council wanna speak.

93
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:56,000
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd just like to read the citation, and May, we have a few more speeches, if you don't mind.

94
00:10:57,143 --> 00:10:59,525
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a nice comfy seat next to you if you want to sit down.

95
00:10:59,545 --> 00:11:19,703
[SPEAKER_09]: It says the Meffitt City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council accommodation to May Makibrek in recognition of her 25 years of distinguished service as founder and member of the Friends of Chevalier Auditorium and GMAC Gymnasium, signed May 16th by Council President Richard Caviello and Vice President Michael J. Mox.

96
00:11:54,102 --> 00:11:55,663
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, uh, Councilor Marks.

97
00:11:55,963 --> 00:12:02,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, I'm just gonna, uh, do a little, uh, word checking and make sure that I did say all those things.

98
00:12:06,007 --> 00:12:14,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, well, this is a very, uh, special moment, and I appreciate all of you have come here this evening.

99
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:23,555
[SPEAKER_01]: When, uh, President Caviello called me about coming here tonight, I thought he was gonna ask me to be on a subcommittee.

100
00:12:26,124 --> 00:12:29,266
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was going to have to say, I'm sorry.

101
00:12:31,747 --> 00:12:53,881
[SPEAKER_01]: At any rate, in accepting this very, very wonderful tribute, I also have to give a lot of credit to all of the people who have been working on the Friends of Chevalier for the past 25 years.

102
00:12:55,497 --> 00:13:01,040
[SPEAKER_01]: those past and those present, some of which are here in the chamber tonight.

103
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:17,809
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, and thinking back about that early time, uh, I would just like to remember a few of our dear friends who are probably looking down on us this evening.

104
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:23,732
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be a Teresa Cerullo, wife of Michael Cerullo,

105
00:13:25,917 --> 00:13:48,845
[SPEAKER_01]: and John Nostry, and there may be others that I hope I haven't overlooked, Dick Oba, who were very, very much a part of the early days when we established the Friends of Chevalier.

106
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:54,927
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the years, the group has worked very diligently

107
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:59,225
[SPEAKER_01]: and very quietly, but has accomplished a great deal.

108
00:14:00,285 --> 00:14:11,989
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, in addition to being advocates for the theater and the Boys and Girls Club for these many years, they also raised a considerable amount of money.

109
00:14:13,189 --> 00:14:17,130
[SPEAKER_01]: And believe it or not, that would be more than $350,000.

110
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:53,147
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the major grants that was given to the friends was from the Cummings Foundation, which is a local philanthropic organization by Bill Cummings and his wife.

111
00:14:54,607 --> 00:14:57,628
[SPEAKER_01]: As you know, the property here are joining us.

112
00:14:58,775 --> 00:15:00,456
[SPEAKER_01]: is owned by the Cummings people.

113
00:15:01,396 --> 00:15:10,480
[SPEAKER_01]: So they gave $100,000 to add staff to the Boys and Girls Club.

114
00:15:11,301 --> 00:15:20,965
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to say that I'm very, very proud that the friends were a big part of the Boys and Girls Club coming here to Medford.

115
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:25,107
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, they have been extremely successful.

116
00:15:26,288 --> 00:15:26,808
[SPEAKER_01]: The, uh,

117
00:15:27,588 --> 00:15:37,651
[SPEAKER_01]: they still have a waiting list in spite of the additional money that they receive from the Cummings people to add instructional staff.

118
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:55,077
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have been quietly working away over the years and I just hope that those of you at some time may consider giving a small contribution because it's always very, very welcome.

119
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,298
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to, uh,

120
00:15:58,392 --> 00:16:10,465
[SPEAKER_01]: recognize, as Council Marks did, the current members on the board, and to wish you good luck going forward.

121
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:11,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all very much.

122
00:16:27,897 --> 00:16:28,878
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Lungo-Kern.

123
00:16:29,178 --> 00:16:30,519
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, Vice President Marks.

124
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:35,762
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't want to put you on the spot any longer, Mae, but I think a few of us just want to say a few words.

125
00:16:35,942 --> 00:16:41,686
[SPEAKER_23]: We've been in and Council Marks did a great job announcing you and taking quotes.

126
00:16:41,746 --> 00:16:42,286
[SPEAKER_23]: That was great.

127
00:16:42,987 --> 00:16:47,350
[SPEAKER_23]: But just from my standpoint, you've been a true leader in this community.

128
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:49,171
[SPEAKER_23]: You've done such wonderful things that have

129
00:16:49,796 --> 00:17:08,316
[SPEAKER_23]: So many people have benefited from, families and every resident in this community has benefited from your work with the Chevalier and Cachet and everything else you were involved in and the fact that you did it because you love this city and you wanted to make it better means a lot and I look up to you May and I wish you the best and good luck in your retirement.

130
00:17:08,556 --> 00:17:08,896
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

131
00:17:11,379 --> 00:17:12,160
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Del Rosso.

132
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,091
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

133
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:17,072
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to also congratulate you, May.

134
00:17:18,272 --> 00:17:35,319
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to thank you for your energy, your selfless devotion to the city, your generosity to give of your spirit and your energy and yourself to so many commitments is tough and we thank you.

135
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,201
[SPEAKER_16]: And I hope you keep going and going until you get it right.

136
00:17:40,642 --> 00:17:41,422
[SPEAKER_16]: So keep at it.

137
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,339
[SPEAKER_16]: practice makes perfect.

152
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:30,334
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, you've always been ahead of the curve on a lot of issues when people, when they weren't popular, you were there to push them.

153
00:18:30,754 --> 00:18:33,796
[SPEAKER_13]: I was there when you received your Citizen of the Year Award.

154
00:18:33,816 --> 00:18:36,477

[SPEAKER_08]: fellow leader and thank you for everything you do.

163
00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:19,958
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that, I think my council of, um, colleagues have said so much and there's not much more that I can add, but just thank you.

164
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:29,283
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and really to reach out to the rest of the community and say, this is who we should emulate because methods are great city to live in.

165
00:19:29,864 --> 00:19:33,726
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's people like yourself who give so much and ask for so little.

166
00:19:34,346 --> 00:19:37,648
[SPEAKER_08]: And, um, um, I hope someone,

167
00:19:38,033 --> 00:19:43,377
[SPEAKER_08]: really sees that torch and runs with it, as you're such a great role model.

168
00:19:43,397 --> 00:19:44,198

171
00:19:51,864 --> 00:19:54,266
[SPEAKER_14]: I could say the same thing that my councilors have all said.

172
00:19:54,766 --> 00:19:55,767
[SPEAKER_14]: I echo their sentiment.

173
00:19:56,188 --> 00:20:00,411
[SPEAKER_14]: I am wondering, however, what you get for 25 years of service.

174
00:20:00,451 --> 00:20:01,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Is it a watch?

175
00:20:01,492 --> 00:20:03,674
[SPEAKER_14]: Do they give you a watch from the Cheville Air Commission?

176
00:20:05,093 --> 00:20:05,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

177
00:20:05,473 --> 00:20:06,554
[SPEAKER_14]: That's pretty good.

178
00:20:06,894 --> 00:20:08,115
[SPEAKER_14]: That's an incentive right there.

179
00:20:09,195 --> 00:20:10,075
[SPEAKER_14]: May congratulations.

180
00:20:10,155 --> 00:20:11,016

[SPEAKER_09]: She has been with us for almost two decades.

188
00:20:41,172 --> 00:20:46,456
[SPEAKER_09]: The time we have spent so far to bring back this unique community asset to full public benefit.

189
00:20:47,116 --> 00:20:53,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Her insights, energy, wise counsel, and steadfastness have been invaluable to us over the years.

190
00:20:53,781 --> 00:20:59,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Mae has brought a unique blend of both traditional and new Meffitt to the table, and her enthusiasm and passion

191
00:21:00,285 --> 00:21:02,247

192
00:21:02,687 --> 00:21:03,347

195
00:21:12,955 --> 00:21:19,380
[SPEAKER_09]: Although we are sure we'll see her around town, we intend to honor her in our own way at one of our events this summer.

196
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:23,042
[SPEAKER_09]: So we hope she is ready to be embarrassed once again.

197
00:21:23,563 --> 00:21:26,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for your continued support of the Brooks Estates.

[SPEAKER_05]: Tonight's actually an interesting night.

289
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:11,323
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the 43rd program year of the Community Development Block Grant, and I'm actually before you.

290
00:34:11,848 --> 00:34:16,793
[SPEAKER_05]: With an estimated allocation, we are estimating that we will receive the money that we have received last year.

291
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:23,279
[SPEAKER_05]: But this year, for the first time, after 43 years of the CDBG program, we don't have our allocation from the federal government.

292
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,662
[SPEAKER_05]: As you all know, the debates that have been going on in it, which I won't go into detail.

293
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:30,846
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've been instructed by the area HUD office to prepare our budgets and move ahead.

294
00:34:31,387 --> 00:34:36,632
[SPEAKER_05]: And then have a phrase in our application, which we have in the notice that we gave to the city clerk.

295
00:34:37,043 --> 00:34:43,285
[SPEAKER_05]: that basically says we will proportionately increase or decrease this budget based on what the actual allocation amounts are.

296
00:34:43,685 --> 00:34:47,746
[SPEAKER_05]: We expect that we should get them by the end of the June and then they'll move very quickly.

297
00:34:47,786 --> 00:34:52,247
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to be submitted to HUD so that they can meet their statutory requirements for review.

298
00:34:52,788 --> 00:34:59,990
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, sorry, there we go.

299
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:00,670
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh,

300
00:35:01,586 --> 00:35:11,971
[SPEAKER_05]: housing activities, physical improvements to public systems and city systems, economic development, public services, planning and administration, and program income.

301
00:35:12,592 --> 00:35:15,733
[SPEAKER_05]: And those budgets will also include public services.

302
00:35:16,174 --> 00:35:20,516
[SPEAKER_05]: We have funded here in this program about 14 public service agencies for a total of $210,586.

303
00:35:21,556 --> 00:35:26,539
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they're listening tonight, they should remember that caveat I just said.

304
00:35:26,939 --> 00:35:28,760
[SPEAKER_05]: It's contingent on receipt of the federal funds.

305
00:35:29,403 --> 00:35:31,063
[SPEAKER_05]: from the Community Development Block Grant Program.

306
00:35:31,083 --> 00:35:41,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody's support to their Congress people and to the President about continuing this program is appreciated, and we've appreciated all of the support of the City Council to accomplish many great activities.

307
00:35:42,086 --> 00:35:46,547
[SPEAKER_05]: If you'd like, I can respond to specific questions if you would like to keep this portion of the hearing short.

308
00:35:46,567 --> 00:35:47,227
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

309
00:35:47,247 --> 00:35:48,067
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Del Rosso.

310
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:58,750
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, year after year, we have meetings with representatives and delegations from various public service organizations and non-profits who do business in our city.

311
00:35:59,126 --> 00:36:01,507
[SPEAKER_16]: and who benefit from these grants.

312
00:36:02,207 --> 00:36:10,330
[SPEAKER_16]: The Office of Community Development goes through great lengths to accommodate and to disperse these funds in a kind manner.

313
00:36:11,610 --> 00:36:15,952
[SPEAKER_16]: And a great sense of concern is put into this.

314
00:36:16,532 --> 00:36:27,536
[SPEAKER_16]: So in that light, and I must lament the possibility of diminishment of these fundings, but I move approval to the plan that's been presented to us.

315
00:36:28,056 --> 00:36:28,376
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

316
00:36:29,157 --> 00:36:29,717
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

317
00:36:30,217 --> 00:36:32,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I too support the plan that's been presented to us.

318
00:36:32,778 --> 00:36:37,979
[SPEAKER_14]: The office of community development doesn't, has done an excellent job since my election to the council and explaining where these funds go.

319
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:46,341
[SPEAKER_14]: All the applicants come before the council at a committee of the whole meeting and pitch their case to, um, request this funding as to why it would be good for the city of Medford.

320
00:36:46,841 --> 00:36:51,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, provided that, um, there's nobody here in opposition, Mr. President, I'd move that we close the public hearing.

321
00:36:53,442 --> 00:36:55,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks, vice president marks.

322
00:36:55,923 --> 00:36:56,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

323
00:36:57,523 --> 00:37:02,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Lauren, are the human service groups made aware of what is happening?

324
00:37:03,047 --> 00:37:03,167
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

325
00:37:03,187 --> 00:37:04,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we send a letter?

326
00:37:04,547 --> 00:37:05,848
[SPEAKER_09]: How are they made aware?

327
00:37:06,148 --> 00:37:08,230
[SPEAKER_05]: We've actually had a meeting with them before.

328
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:13,573
[SPEAKER_05]: We met with a committee, the whole of the city council had a meeting that we do with the senior center every year.

329
00:37:13,593 --> 00:37:14,373
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all invited.

330
00:37:14,413 --> 00:37:15,814
[SPEAKER_05]: They're told in that meeting notice.

331
00:37:16,214 --> 00:37:16,955
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of them come.

332
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:18,296
[SPEAKER_05]: They're really supposed to all come.

333
00:37:18,316 --> 00:37:20,337
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple don't come, but they've all been told.

334
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:22,885
[SPEAKER_05]: about what the status of it is.

335
00:37:22,945 --> 00:37:26,126
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of them actually have this similar problem where there are other funding sources.

336
00:37:26,146 --> 00:37:27,167
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yes, they all know that.

337
00:37:28,027 --> 00:37:33,330
[SPEAKER_05]: When we will be waiting for the allocation, we won't make any announcements and there won't be any contracts executed.

338
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:36,171
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't do that until HUD actually gives us the allocation.

339
00:37:36,231 --> 00:37:37,131
[SPEAKER_05]: We submit our plan.

340
00:37:37,251 --> 00:37:38,172
[SPEAKER_05]: It's approved.

341
00:37:38,832 --> 00:37:47,076
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, it's probably likely that money, if they move things along the way they're talking, would probably be available, I'm going to guess, sometime in August or late September.

342
00:37:48,563 --> 00:37:55,105
[SPEAKER_05]: they'll know we keep them informed and I think they all pretty much know they're suffering the similar problems with other funding sources as I said.

343
00:37:55,565 --> 00:38:05,867
[SPEAKER_09]: So as any group mentioned that because of maybe staff hiring or other employee issues that there may be a concern if they don't get the funding from day one?

344
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:08,288
[SPEAKER_05]: They have not raised those issues to us.

345
00:38:08,488 --> 00:38:09,428
[SPEAKER_09]: There's been no issues.

346
00:38:10,128 --> 00:38:10,468
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

347
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:12,889
[SPEAKER_23]: Counselor Lungo-Curran.

348
00:38:13,009 --> 00:38:14,589
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President Carviello.

349
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,350
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for coming.

350
00:38:18,371 --> 00:38:21,873
[SPEAKER_23]: with regards to the allocation portion of it, nobody's going to be cut out?

351
00:38:21,973 --> 00:38:24,735
[SPEAKER_23]: Is it just going to be if we receive 10% less?

352
00:38:24,755 --> 00:38:26,577
[SPEAKER_05]: How would it be broken down?

353
00:38:26,917 --> 00:38:30,439
[SPEAKER_05]: So the maximum we can fund is 15% of the total allocation.

354
00:38:30,459 --> 00:38:33,922
[SPEAKER_05]: And the table you see there, and I want to clarify a couple of things for you on that.

355
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:38,223
[SPEAKER_05]: The table you see there allocating $210,000 is if we get level funded.

356
00:38:38,703 --> 00:38:47,531
[SPEAKER_05]: So the way I'm proposing is that we would increase these agencies up to a maximum of 15% if the allocation increases, and decrease them proportionally if the allocation is cut.

357
00:38:48,251 --> 00:38:49,552
[SPEAKER_05]: There are two things, two changes.

358
00:38:49,572 --> 00:38:52,335
[SPEAKER_05]: The Medford Housing Authority did not receive money last year.

359
00:38:52,375 --> 00:39:03,824
[SPEAKER_05]: They applied for money, about $8,000 to hire, or actually pay a stipend to someone to provide language translation services at the walking court development for people who are Haitian.

360
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:08,610
[SPEAKER_05]: And honestly, in order for us to fund the number one, we don't know if we're going to get the money.

361
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, we'd have to cut our other agency by that.

362
00:39:10,871 --> 00:39:15,654
[SPEAKER_05]: So to give them a token amount we didn't think would really be beneficial, and we'd have to cut another agency.

363
00:39:16,074 --> 00:39:19,095
[SPEAKER_05]: And a couple of these agencies are receiving under a couple of thousand dollars.

364
00:39:19,676 --> 00:39:21,717
[SPEAKER_05]: Salvation Army is an agency that did apply.

365
00:39:22,017 --> 00:39:25,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year, Salvation Army was the agency with all the resources that they have.

366
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:31,055
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, you know, under a couple of thousand dollars that they get from us, they returned back money last year.

367
00:39:31,335 --> 00:39:32,755
[SPEAKER_05]: They're very stringent.

368
00:39:33,576 --> 00:39:41,218
[SPEAKER_05]: How do I want to say, um, intentions about the person that we deal with intentions about how they want to distribute the money.

369
00:39:41,258 --> 00:39:45,620
[SPEAKER_05]: And so again, we've already heard that they may not spend the money and this is very emergency assistance money.

370
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:51,082
[SPEAKER_05]: So we, uh, made a recommendation to the mayor, which she agreed was to allocate that to another agency.

371
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,883
[SPEAKER_05]: And you will see that we have, um,

372
00:39:54,353 --> 00:40:07,376
[SPEAKER_05]: suggested that the community family which provides Alzheimer's assistance and subsidizes the tuition or the fees for a Medford resident or more than one resident if there's money available, they receive $1,745.

373
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:10,437
[SPEAKER_05]: We've recommended they go up to $2,907.

374
00:40:10,937 --> 00:40:21,020
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we'll, you know, as we can, if we can, poke down to get some of these other agencies that are under a couple thousand dollars up in the future that we hope to try to do that.

375
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:21,960
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what we did.

376
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:27,323
[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor for housing authority, which never has not received money into public services.

377
00:40:27,823 --> 00:40:34,408
[SPEAKER_05]: And then salvation army was eliminated on the fact that they did not spend their money last year and are not on target to spend it again this year.

378
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:35,689
[SPEAKER_23]: Gotcha.

379
00:40:35,709 --> 00:40:37,871
[SPEAKER_23]: So that explains why the two aren't in here.

380
00:40:37,991 --> 00:40:48,118
[SPEAKER_23]: And then if we did get 15% more, these one to 10, 15, um, agencies will get 15% more across the board.

381
00:40:48,138 --> 00:40:48,759
[SPEAKER_05]: If it was 15, it would be 15.

382
00:40:48,859 --> 00:40:50,260
[SPEAKER_05]: If it was 10, 10% cut, they'd be 10% cut.

383
00:40:52,123 --> 00:40:55,325
[SPEAKER_05]: what I'm getting at is none will get changed dramatically depending.

384
00:40:55,365 --> 00:40:56,125
[SPEAKER_05]: It depends.

385
00:40:56,245 --> 00:41:00,928
[SPEAKER_05]: It depends on, we could get no funding and then they will get nothing and we will get nothing.

386
00:41:01,448 --> 00:41:03,429
[SPEAKER_05]: So, but I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm trust.

387
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:08,092
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we have to trust still in the system of government that we have and that that won't happen.

388
00:41:08,672 --> 00:41:10,133
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so yes.

389
00:41:10,353 --> 00:41:16,577
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why we do support everybody basically letting know their elected officials know the importance of this program and advocating for it.

390
00:41:17,537 --> 00:41:17,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

391
00:41:17,998 --> 00:41:20,359
[SPEAKER_23]: And then my last question would just be just to give us a,

392
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:28,575
[SPEAKER_23]: a brief summary, I mean, people at home should know a little bit of where this money's going, how much we have as a total, and where it goes.

393
00:41:28,635 --> 00:41:30,535
[SPEAKER_23]: So if you could give us a brief summary, that would be helpful.

394
00:41:30,555 --> 00:41:36,118
[SPEAKER_05]: So the total amount of money that we're estimating, again, it's an estimate, is $1,403,210.

395
00:41:36,638 --> 00:41:39,159
[SPEAKER_05]: We're allocating, we're proposing $20,000 for housing.

396
00:41:39,199 --> 00:41:43,520
[SPEAKER_05]: We have some existing housing money, so that's not all the money that we have for housing resources.

397
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:50,843
[SPEAKER_05]: We're also eligible to access money with non-profit agencies through the city's relationship with the North Suburban Consortium.

398
00:41:51,542 --> 00:41:52,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Economic development, $20,000.

399
00:41:53,003 --> 00:41:57,206
[SPEAKER_05]: As you see, we talked about the storefront program and economic development strategy.

400
00:41:57,286 --> 00:41:58,707
[SPEAKER_05]: We still have some money from this year.

401
00:41:58,727 --> 00:42:00,609
[SPEAKER_05]: We have not implemented that storefront program.

402
00:42:00,629 --> 00:42:05,312
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have money from this year, and we'd have money going forward if this is funded.

403
00:42:05,612 --> 00:42:10,096
[SPEAKER_05]: Public services, you cannot carry money over from one year to the next on public services.

404
00:42:10,536 --> 00:42:15,840
[SPEAKER_05]: So that $210,000 would be the max, and that's contingent on that allocation number that I told you.

405
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,382
[SPEAKER_05]: And those go to a variety of agencies.

406
00:42:20,228 --> 00:42:25,671
[SPEAKER_05]: people working with after-school programs to English language classes.

407
00:42:26,872 --> 00:42:32,035
[SPEAKER_05]: The senior center here in Medford receives a good portion of the money.

408
00:42:32,196 --> 00:42:35,318
[SPEAKER_05]: SCM Community Transportation is an agency that also is well-funded.

409
00:42:35,898 --> 00:42:39,881
[SPEAKER_05]: We have an agency that provides housing counseling services.

410
00:42:40,321 --> 00:42:48,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I shouldn't use housing counseling services anymore because HUD has now defined that strictly, but housing referral agencies and advocacy and protection for people who are going through

411
00:42:49,384 --> 00:42:51,625
[SPEAKER_05]: evictions and things like that, representation in court.

412
00:42:52,146 --> 00:43:00,994
[SPEAKER_05]: So, and we also have funding that goes to EMARC and I think the, not I think, I know, the Boys and Girls Club.

413
00:43:01,014 --> 00:43:07,639
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are generally the kind of services, they're a wide range of very important services that assist Medford's low and moderate income populations.

414
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:12,984
[SPEAKER_05]: And planning and admin, admin goes for any kind of study that's related to the CDBG program.

415
00:43:13,004 --> 00:43:16,507
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be fair housing if that's what happens, so we help pay toward the city's

416
00:43:16,856 --> 00:43:18,838
[SPEAKER_05]: single audit for the portion of our program.

417
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:24,582
[SPEAKER_05]: It also funds the majority of the staff costs in our office and a portion of the diversity of director's office.

418
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:31,208
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

419
00:43:31,548 --> 00:43:31,888
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

420
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:39,374
[SPEAKER_14]: It's also my understanding, Mr. Lorenzo, that a draft of the plan can be updated in the office of community development on April 20th.

421
00:43:39,454 --> 00:43:42,637
[SPEAKER_05]: It's currently available in our office.

422
00:43:42,717 --> 00:43:46,120
[SPEAKER_05]: There is also a copy, a draft version of that plan.

423
00:43:46,563 --> 00:43:47,624

426
00:43:55,348 --> 00:43:59,010

427
00:43:59,050 --> 00:44:04,732
[SPEAKER_05]: So, uh, if anybody has a comment that they would like to make, they're welcome to submit it to us and it'll be formally included in the plan.

[SPEAKER_16]: 17-4-5-0.

462
00:45:45,602 --> 00:45:45,582
17.

463

[SPEAKER_16]: 17-4.

464
00:45:53,089 --> 00:45:55,690
[SPEAKER_13]: petitions, presentations, and similar matters.

465
00:45:56,350 --> 00:46:10,613
[SPEAKER_13]: Petition for signed denial reversal by Raphael Batista, Raphographic for Global Healthcare Enterprises, 5 High Street, Medford Mass, OCD application 2017, 7B94306, exceeds allowable amounts.

00:46:11,693 --> 00:46:13,614
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please.

467
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:22,946
[SPEAKER_26]: My name is Rafael Batista.

468
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:25,068
[SPEAKER_26]: The address is 5 High Street in Medford.

469
00:46:25,568 --> 00:46:31,813
[SPEAKER_16]: The business is Global Health Care.

470
00:46:32,133 --> 00:46:38,459
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, please state your reasons for in the scope that you're asking for reversal of the sign denial.

471
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:50,989
[SPEAKER_26]: The first reason is going to be that we request to be two signs because of the large size of the building and directions of the street.

472
00:46:52,185 --> 00:47:03,551
[SPEAKER_26]: whoever's coming into one side of the building, we're not going to be able to see the other side of the building, which the client has the top, the whole top corner of the entire building as his business.

473
00:47:04,432 --> 00:47:09,674
[SPEAKER_26]: And we required to be, we're being required by the inspector to be more darker.

474
00:47:09,835 --> 00:47:12,476
[SPEAKER_26]: So we put the box itself to be Brown's.

475
00:47:12,636 --> 00:47:19,680
[SPEAKER_26]: So we match with the building and the colors to be playing with the colors of our nation, which is red, white, and blue.

476
00:47:20,049 --> 00:47:20,269
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

477
00:47:20,669 --> 00:47:21,850
[SPEAKER_26]: And plain and simple.

478
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:30,353
[SPEAKER_26]: And we also had an issue that we unfortunately made a mistake putting the lettering on the windows that without the permit.

479
00:47:30,613 --> 00:47:32,614
[SPEAKER_26]: And then we've been fined.

480
00:47:32,794 --> 00:47:33,814
[SPEAKER_26]: We paid the fine.

481
00:47:34,534 --> 00:47:41,837
[SPEAKER_26]: And now the client agreed to remove the logos from the windows because we are going to be putting the signs up in approval.

482
00:47:42,895 --> 00:47:54,480
[SPEAKER_26]: but he also wanted to request, if it's possible, there is a possibility to keep the lettering over the surface that he presents on the glasses, which is already on the copy that you guys probably have it.

483
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:55,960
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

484
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:58,201
[SPEAKER_16]: Chair recognizes President Carfiello.

485
00:47:58,642 --> 00:47:59,762
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

486
00:48:00,662 --> 00:48:06,745
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Chairman, I am objecting to the, is this illuminated sign?

487
00:48:07,145 --> 00:48:07,605
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it is.

488
00:48:08,246 --> 00:48:11,587
[SPEAKER_13]: First of all, I'm objecting to the sign being illuminated in the middle of the square.

489
00:48:12,141 --> 00:48:16,663
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm objecting to, it doesn't fit, I don't think, with the rest of the signs in the square.

490
00:48:18,304 --> 00:48:24,107
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it's oversized, but if you could letter it on the building, I think it would look a lot better than an illuminated sign.

491
00:48:24,127 --> 00:48:27,389
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, this is a sign that you see in a strip mall, not in the middle of Meffitt Square.

492
00:48:27,689 --> 00:48:32,811
[SPEAKER_13]: And here we are, we're trying to revive Meffitt Square and make it look a little more pleasurable.

493
00:48:33,312 --> 00:48:37,854
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't feel that that type of sign represents what I'd like to see in Meffitt Square or many of the other people.

494
00:48:39,427 --> 00:48:49,836
[SPEAKER_13]: it would be my request if you could, if you could let it, the building similar to like many of you, if you've seen your pictures here, uh, similar to like, like the other other buildings have.

495
00:48:50,216 --> 00:48:52,738
[SPEAKER_13]: That's, that's my request and not have it illuminated.

496
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:55,941
[SPEAKER_13]: That would be my request to you.

497
00:48:59,424 --> 00:48:59,724
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

498
00:49:00,705 --> 00:49:03,207
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President to chair recognizes the council night.

499
00:49:03,660 --> 00:49:05,161
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, Mr. President, thank you very much.

500
00:49:05,181 --> 00:49:11,146
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, as we go through our packet this evening, we'll see that there are two requests for sign reversals related to five high street.

501
00:49:11,507 --> 00:49:20,795
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think if both petitions before the council this evening were approved, it would be, um, ugly is the best word that I can come up with.

502
00:49:20,835 --> 00:49:30,703
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I don't think it really fits in with the character of the neighborhood based upon, um, the total number of signs that are being presented tonight and the location thereof, uh, all in the same building.

503
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:38,832
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I certainly can agree with counselor Cabello's position that, uh, an illuminated sign wouldn't fit in with the quality, um, and criteria that's down in that area.

504
00:49:39,272 --> 00:49:45,974
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, personally, Mr. President, I think the best course of action would be to have this matter referred to our subcommittee on science, uh, for further review and discussion.

505
00:49:46,154 --> 00:49:55,696
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, I don't think that this is something that, um, when partnered with the other matter that's before us is going to be beneficial to the revitalization of our downtown, uh, of Memphis square.

506
00:49:55,736 --> 00:49:58,077
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's going to, uh, be an eyesore more or less.

507
00:49:58,097 --> 00:49:58,837
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

508
00:49:59,372 --> 00:50:08,437
[SPEAKER_16]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight to refer this matter to the sign committee, seconded by President Caviello, chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

509
00:50:10,499 --> 00:50:11,379
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

510
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:19,104
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what we're seeing here tonight is based on the location of the building.

511
00:50:19,664 --> 00:50:27,869
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you look at the picture that we have on the paper we received, the building is located partially on Forest Street,

512
00:50:28,454 --> 00:50:30,035
[SPEAKER_09]: and partially on high street.

513
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:35,319
[SPEAKER_09]: So for all intents of purposes, it's like this building has two fronting facades.

514
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,802
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's what at least this petition is trying to accomplish.

515
00:50:40,503 --> 00:50:42,244
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't agree with the illuminated signs.

516
00:50:42,304 --> 00:50:47,307
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think this council has been, uh, on record not supporting illuminated signs.

517
00:50:47,908 --> 00:50:50,770
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, however, the, uh, the type of sign,

518
00:50:51,575 --> 00:51:05,081
[SPEAKER_09]: and the number of signs I have no problem with, uh, based on what I believe, uh, is the hardship of having your main entrance on high street and, uh, the rest of your building, uh, on forestry.

519
00:51:05,902 --> 00:51:09,023
[SPEAKER_09]: And that to me proposes a hardship.

520
00:51:09,424 --> 00:51:13,405
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the additional signage is warranted in this particular case.

521
00:51:14,046 --> 00:51:15,927
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't agree with my other colleagues.

522
00:51:16,567 --> 00:51:18,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, the only thing I do agree with is the fact that,

523
00:51:19,526 --> 00:51:23,067
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't support the internally illuminated portion of it.

524
00:51:24,007 --> 00:51:29,169
[SPEAKER_09]: If it's the druthers of the council to send this to the sign committee, I have no problem with that.

525
00:51:29,549 --> 00:51:35,210
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not quite sure what we're going to accomplish there that we couldn't accomplish right now with the party before us.

526
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:43,772
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's recommendations, you know, if the party agrees upon them now, I don't see why we have to have a subcommittee meeting on this issue.

527
00:51:45,113 --> 00:51:46,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are my thoughts, Mr. President.

528
00:51:47,114 --> 00:51:47,895
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

529
00:51:48,015 --> 00:52:05,345
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, as chairman of the business and economic development and science committee, uh, also, uh, with myself and councilor Scott Pelley, uh, we'll, uh, once we, uh, finished with debate on this matter, we'll take the, the vote on the motion chair recognizes councilor Scott Pelley.

530
00:52:06,826 --> 00:52:15,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, if I can, if I know what the, the denial of the signs, I think that if you look at the rest of the square and keeping with the theme that we have right now,

531
00:52:17,195 --> 00:52:45,322
[SPEAKER_08]: If you look across the street, I don't disagree with Council Marks and the petitioner looking for the number of signs, but if you look at the way that Andre Realty did what they did across the street, they have multiple signs, but the way they addressed it, it fits the look of the square where it's not illuminated, and they added decorative lights around it that would light the sign, but at the same time,

532
00:52:45,838 --> 00:52:55,366
[SPEAKER_08]: keeps the same appeal and routine throughout our business community in Meffitt Square.

533
00:52:55,786 --> 00:53:01,391
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not a fan of the lit sign.

534
00:53:02,532 --> 00:53:09,277
[SPEAKER_08]: If you look across the other businesses in the square, I think you could see that it's tasteful.

535
00:53:10,898 --> 00:53:12,940
[SPEAKER_08]: And with the different forms of lighting,

536
00:53:13,384 --> 00:53:20,069
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you can accommodate what you're looking for to illuminate your sign with what the neighboring businesses have.

537
00:53:20,189 --> 00:53:23,431
[SPEAKER_08]: So I too will not support the illuminated sign.

538
00:53:24,112 --> 00:53:32,938
[SPEAKER_08]: I will entertain, you know, a few different signs location because it does wrap around so I can understand that need.

539
00:53:33,118 --> 00:53:38,882
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, I can't, I will not support the big illuminated signs.

540
00:53:39,737 --> 00:53:40,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor.

541
00:53:40,497 --> 00:53:42,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair recognizes Councilor Lungo-Curran.

542
00:53:42,838 --> 00:53:46,500
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President...Councilor De La Ruzo, sorry.

543
00:53:47,581 --> 00:53:51,002
[SPEAKER_23]: With regards to the science, were awnings discussed at all?

544
00:53:53,584 --> 00:53:53,924
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

545
00:53:55,605 --> 00:53:59,706
[SPEAKER_26]: We thought about it, but we thought that would be more complicated to get approval on that.

546
00:54:00,827 --> 00:54:09,051
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I mean, Nick, I am trying to hear out what my council colleagues are saying, and you did attach... Oh, actually, Wayside, which is the next petitioner, did attach

547
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:16,422
[SPEAKER_23]: signs from across the street, which are much more expensive signs and obviously very nice character for the neighborhood.

548
00:54:16,982 --> 00:54:19,223
[SPEAKER_23]: But I understand that not everybody can afford that.

549
00:54:19,443 --> 00:54:25,545
[SPEAKER_23]: And at the same token, where these two businesses are, you do have awnings at the restaurant.

550
00:54:26,205 --> 00:54:27,485
[SPEAKER_23]: So maybe even that would help.

551
00:54:28,105 --> 00:54:32,086
[SPEAKER_23]: Something like that would be a little in-between resolution.

552
00:54:32,106 --> 00:54:35,127
[SPEAKER_23]: And I'm not sure if it will help all my colleagues.

553
00:54:35,247 --> 00:54:37,568
[SPEAKER_23]: But I just was curious if that was discussed at all.

554
00:54:38,101 --> 00:54:40,263
[SPEAKER_23]: That is a tough location to have a business.

555
00:54:40,303 --> 00:54:41,304
[SPEAKER_23]: The parking is tough.

556
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:47,810
[SPEAKER_23]: So I do see the need for a sign on each street, forest and high.

557
00:54:47,990 --> 00:54:48,951
[SPEAKER_23]: So I agree with that.

558
00:54:49,071 --> 00:55:02,764
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think we're almost along the same lines, but whether or not you want to take it back and do a redesign to appease all the counselors or get two signs with just with no illumination, I think it's kind of up to you.

559
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:14,163
[SPEAKER_23]: because I do like what's across the street better, but at the same token, I understand that's probably much more pricey and there are awnings and different wall stickers on the building you're on.

560
00:55:14,183 --> 00:55:19,466
[SPEAKER_23]: So I mean, business has to do what they can afford, although it would be nice to have some conformity.

561
00:55:23,568 --> 00:55:24,588
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Madam Councilor.

562
00:55:25,009 --> 00:55:26,509
[SPEAKER_16]: Chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

563
00:55:26,669 --> 00:55:27,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

564
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:34,293
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm reviewing the documents here and I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of the illuminated sign,

565
00:55:35,035 --> 00:55:45,558
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I look at the signs in the square, the other thing that I like, and we're trying to, I think in many ways, the community is trying to rebrand Method Square because we're trying to bring business in.

566
00:55:45,578 --> 00:55:51,420
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I look at these signs at other businesses, everything seems to be very uniform.

567
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:52,761
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all on the same level.

568
00:55:53,581 --> 00:56:00,243
[SPEAKER_03]: If I take a look at the sign, your sign, and then I take a look at Wayside, you know, Wayside

569
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:09,118
[SPEAKER_03]: seems to be in line with the rest of the businesses, and you're popping up in the air a bit, which just seems out of whack, kind of.

570
00:56:09,398 --> 00:56:12,699
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it doesn't seem that clean.

571
00:56:12,739 --> 00:56:16,461
[SPEAKER_03]: It just seems like it would be nice if you could kind of get everything in one uniform way.

572
00:56:17,801 --> 00:56:21,342
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will admit, I'm not a big fan of the illuminated signs.

573
00:56:21,482 --> 00:56:22,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any flexibility on that?

574
00:56:24,464 --> 00:56:25,044
[SPEAKER_26]: I believe so.

575
00:56:25,464 --> 00:56:27,084
[SPEAKER_26]: I actually have a question right now.

576
00:56:28,807 --> 00:56:34,789
[SPEAKER_26]: What about, I'm just counting here, looks like we have six sets of windows up in his office.

577
00:56:35,349 --> 00:56:40,851
[SPEAKER_26]: Would it be allowed, do you guys, would it allow if we present to the client to be awnings instead?

578
00:56:40,871 --> 00:56:49,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, you want to put awnings in the place of the site?

579
00:56:49,954 --> 00:56:51,894
[SPEAKER_26]: Awnings on top of each window.

580
00:56:52,714 --> 00:56:54,655
[SPEAKER_26]: On top of the windows at the very top?

581
00:56:54,815 --> 00:56:55,715
[SPEAKER_26]: At the very top, yes.

582
00:56:56,476 --> 00:56:57,716
[SPEAKER_26]: Perhaps we could do like red,

583
00:56:58,507 --> 00:57:02,408
[SPEAKER_26]: And then with the white, just white letters, global health care.

584
00:57:03,088 --> 00:57:13,431
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm wondering if that needs to be, uh, discussed it with your client and, uh, uh, perhaps the property owner, uh, to the point of information council night.

585
00:57:13,671 --> 00:57:24,294
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, when I raised the issue of referring it to the subcommittee, my intention was to do so so that we could get both petitioners wayside and global health services together in the same room and they could make a joint presentation to the council.

586
00:57:24,354 --> 00:57:26,295
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks like it would be something that would fit more.

587
00:57:26,705 --> 00:57:30,606
[SPEAKER_14]: within the quality and character of the neighborhood was the way that I was thinking that it was going to work out.

588
00:57:30,626 --> 00:57:33,027
[SPEAKER_16]: That's how I took your motion to be attended.

589
00:57:35,747 --> 00:57:37,848
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Falco, you still have the floor?

590
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:38,688
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm all set.

591
00:57:38,728 --> 00:57:39,028
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

592
00:57:39,168 --> 00:57:39,548
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

593
00:57:39,908 --> 00:57:45,009
[SPEAKER_16]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight is seconded by Councilor Carviello, President Carviello.

594
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:46,170
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

595
00:57:46,470 --> 00:57:47,290
[SPEAKER_16]: Aye.

596
00:57:47,390 --> 00:57:48,250
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks?

597
00:57:50,211 --> 00:57:52,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Please record me in opposition to this, Mr. President.

598
00:57:52,971 --> 00:57:54,892
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not support the illuminated sign.

599
00:57:55,963 --> 00:58:03,485
[SPEAKER_09]: but I do support moving forward with the signage on both forest and high street because of the hardship the petitioner has.

600
00:58:03,925 --> 00:58:11,227
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good on that motion and recognizing, uh, counselor marks, uh, opposition, all those in favor, all those opposed.

601
00:58:11,667 --> 00:58:12,227
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

602
00:58:15,788 --> 00:58:18,969
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, counselor night, um, 17 four five one.

603
00:58:19,409 --> 00:58:23,630
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, it's going to, it's going to sound like the same exact conversation I think we just had.

604
00:58:23,930 --> 00:58:24,270
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

605
00:58:24,838 --> 00:58:30,141
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Knight to take 17451 out of order.

606
00:58:30,441 --> 00:58:31,221
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

607
00:58:31,281 --> 00:58:32,742
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

608
00:58:33,562 --> 00:58:40,706
[SPEAKER_16]: 17451, petition for signed denial reversal by Richard DiTullio, property manager for Wayside Youth and Family, 5 High Street, Medford, Mass.

609
00:58:41,166 --> 00:58:50,070
[SPEAKER_16]: OCD application 2017-11A exceeds allowable size, secondary sign, and window signage.

610
00:58:51,008 --> 00:58:52,349
[SPEAKER_16]: Is the petitioner present?

611
00:58:52,409 --> 00:58:54,331
[SPEAKER_16]: If you are, please present yourself to the podium.

612
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:56,112
[SPEAKER_16]: State your name and address for the record.

613
00:58:59,054 --> 00:58:59,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

614
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:02,777
[SPEAKER_06]: My name's Richard Detulio, property manager with Wayside Youth.

615
00:59:04,178 --> 00:59:08,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here with the owner of the sign company, Rachel O'Donoghue.

616
00:59:08,521 --> 00:59:09,001
[SPEAKER_16]: How do you do?

617
00:59:09,081 --> 00:59:10,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

618
00:59:10,482 --> 00:59:17,027
[SPEAKER_06]: First, I just want to be clear that this gentleman's property is on the second floor.

619
00:59:17,627 --> 00:59:18,348
[SPEAKER_06]: We're aware of that.

620
00:59:19,217 --> 00:59:23,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so is he looking to put a sign adjacent to ours on the ground floor?

621
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:24,961
[SPEAKER_06]: He is.

622
00:59:25,001 --> 00:59:28,304
[SPEAKER_15]: Isn't this space for the first floor tenant?

623
00:59:28,344 --> 00:59:30,185
That's up to the landlord, yes.

624
00:59:45,921 --> 00:59:49,244
[SPEAKER_18]: No wonder they said no, because we're asking to put the sign in that panel.

625
00:59:49,284 --> 00:59:52,906
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can see we have a kind of a collision there of signs.

626
00:59:53,447 --> 01:00:06,597
[SPEAKER_16]: It would seem, and I think the sentiments of the council with us, with the approval of that previous motion, that the wise thing to do would be to meet in committee to where

627
01:00:06,998 --> 01:00:30,838
[SPEAKER_16]: The proceedings can be a little more conversational, that charts and designs can be exchanged, an assessment of what the ordinances are can also be substantiated by the OCD director or the building inspector, and I think we can come to some conclusions in that forum.

628
01:00:32,277 --> 01:00:37,298
[SPEAKER_16]: But you have the floor, so if you would present your matter to us.

629
01:00:37,498 --> 01:00:46,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what we had hoped to do was on the ground floor, we had planned on putting two signs above the windows.

630
01:00:47,361 --> 01:00:51,482
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the signs has been approved by the building department.

631
01:00:52,562 --> 01:00:53,943
[SPEAKER_06]: That sign is in production.

632
01:00:54,003 --> 01:00:56,585
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a non-illuminated sign.

633
01:00:56,805 --> 01:01:03,410
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a white background, green lettering, with our company logo, if you will.

634
01:01:04,370 --> 01:01:12,556
[SPEAKER_06]: What we had wanted to do in our application was add a second sign, again, because of the wrap onto Forest Street.

635
01:01:13,376 --> 01:01:17,959
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition to that, we wanted to put three signs in the window itself.

636
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,841
[SPEAKER_06]: The addition of the sign that the tenant up on the second floor has is a surprise.

637
01:01:25,881 --> 01:01:30,002
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, we can understand why it looks very busy with signs.

638
01:01:32,583 --> 01:01:36,084
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're a not-for-profit.

639
01:01:36,104 --> 01:01:37,404
[SPEAKER_06]: We've been around for a long time.

640
01:01:37,504 --> 01:01:40,704
[SPEAKER_06]: We hope to do well in the Medford area.

641
01:01:43,828 --> 01:01:51,534
[SPEAKER_16]: And, and the council understands for both entities, the importance of, uh, having signs, uh, on a place of, uh, business.

642
01:01:52,174 --> 01:01:56,818
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, so, uh, we're aware of that and, uh, hope to expedite this.

643
01:01:57,658 --> 01:02:05,724
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, but, uh, the chair awaits motion committee on science, business and economic development on that motion.

644
01:02:05,744 --> 01:02:09,307
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, chair recognizes, uh, president Caviello second.

645
01:02:09,567 --> 01:02:10,088
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

646
01:02:10,128 --> 01:02:10,448
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

647
01:02:10,688 --> 01:02:11,989
[SPEAKER_16]: Chair recognizes council marks.

648
01:02:12,430 --> 01:02:26,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, record me in opposition based on the fact that this business, as well as the prior business owner, has the same hardship being located at a very busy intersection on two major roads in the square.

649
01:02:26,841 --> 01:02:30,343
[SPEAKER_09]: And the additional signage, in my opinion, is warranted, Mr. President.

650
01:02:30,964 --> 01:02:41,011
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, after discussing for many years how dark Method Square is, maybe we should start looking at internally illuminated signs to help out with

651
01:02:41,337 --> 01:02:42,957
[SPEAKER_09]: the brightness in the square, Mr. President.

652
01:02:43,738 --> 01:02:48,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and you know, maybe that's something that's needed in this community, Mr. President.

653
01:02:48,118 --> 01:02:51,619
[SPEAKER_09]: So record me in opposition based on those facts.

654
01:02:51,879 --> 01:02:52,439
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

655
01:02:52,879 --> 01:03:00,041
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, and, uh, perhaps I might say from the chair that externally, uh, illuminated science might achieve the same.

656
01:03:00,441 --> 01:03:09,263
[SPEAKER_16]: So on the motion of council night, seconded by a council Caviello, uh, understanding that, uh, council marks wishes to be marked in opposition chair recognizes vice president, uh,

657
01:03:10,403 --> 01:03:12,925
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor.

658
01:03:13,005 --> 01:03:18,548
[SPEAKER_23]: I also want to be recorded in opposition with regards to the two signs for the front of the building.

659
01:03:18,648 --> 01:03:23,571
[SPEAKER_23]: I think that's, like I said in the last petition, I think that's necessary for this location.

660
01:03:23,732 --> 01:03:27,254
[SPEAKER_23]: So I just want to be recorded in opposition for those two signs.

661
01:03:27,774 --> 01:03:28,174
[SPEAKER_16]: Very good.

662
01:03:28,855 --> 01:03:29,515
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion.

663
01:03:30,556 --> 01:03:32,537
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

664
01:03:32,737 --> 01:03:33,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

665
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:33,758
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the,

666
01:03:35,002 --> 01:03:37,664
[SPEAKER_08]: the biggest confusion right now is the muddy water.

667
01:03:37,704 --> 01:03:39,525
[SPEAKER_08]: Now with the other look, the other issue.

668
01:03:39,785 --> 01:03:45,048
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't, if you came to us with this being the only issue with two signs, I would support it.

669
01:03:45,109 --> 01:03:56,276
[SPEAKER_08]: But with the other signs, one going above it now in my mind to, to prove that and then possibly have that as an option later, I can't support it.

670
01:03:56,316 --> 01:04:04,481
[SPEAKER_08]: So I, I, I, I would go with the subcommittee so we can talk this out and listen to the, um, you know, the, what the landlord has to say and then,

671
01:04:05,667 --> 01:04:06,928
[SPEAKER_08]: and find some other solutions.

672
01:04:06,968 --> 01:04:10,349
[SPEAKER_08]: But when the time comes, I definitely support the two signs.

673
01:04:10,389 --> 01:04:11,629
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's gonna be needed.

674
01:04:12,189 --> 01:04:17,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Typically though, wouldn't the second floor tenant be limited to his window space?

675
01:04:17,551 --> 01:04:20,492
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, we don't know for the fact that there's a landlord issue.

676
01:04:20,532 --> 01:04:21,392
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not with us.

677
01:04:23,673 --> 01:04:28,335
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, you're probably paying the prime rate because you're on the first floor.

678
01:04:30,515 --> 01:04:34,297
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously, there's a solution here and the councilors wanna get to it.

679
01:04:35,435 --> 01:04:36,555
[SPEAKER_16]: I'll say Councillor, thank you.

680
01:04:36,575 --> 01:04:37,896
[SPEAKER_16]: Chair recognizes Councillor Falcone.

681
01:04:37,936 --> 01:04:39,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

682
01:04:39,476 --> 01:04:41,597
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with my colleague, Councillor Scarpelli.

683
01:04:42,457 --> 01:04:43,758
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have no problem with the signs.

684
01:04:44,118 --> 01:04:46,038
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually like the signs and I think they're fine.

685
01:04:46,759 --> 01:04:48,979
[SPEAKER_03]: There is some confusion, though, if you look at these two pictures.

686
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:51,260
[SPEAKER_03]: All these signs are in the same spot.

687
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:59,483
[SPEAKER_18]: I wasn't aware of that because they're renting the first floor, so I assumed that the facade belonged to the first floor tenant.

688
01:04:59,563 --> 01:05:02,984
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't even know there was somebody else moving in there or that they were looking for signs.

689
01:05:04,199 --> 01:05:05,679
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I said, I have no problem with the signs.

690
01:05:05,719 --> 01:05:06,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the signs look fine.

691
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:08,400
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very professional.

692
01:05:08,420 --> 01:05:09,580
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not illuminated.

693
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:11,321
[SPEAKER_03]: They're nice.

694
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:20,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think going to subcommittee, I think we'll hopefully resolve some issues, clear things up, and then come before us again.

695
01:05:20,804 --> 01:05:28,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Chair, we request a meeting relatively quick because I know the hardship here.

696
01:05:28,746 --> 01:05:30,426
[SPEAKER_08]: So it wouldn't be something waiting weeks.

697
01:05:30,446 --> 01:05:32,327
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to get this done as soon as possible if we can.

698
01:05:35,018 --> 01:05:35,698
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, Councilor Knight.

699
01:05:35,938 --> 01:05:36,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Move the question.

700
01:05:37,098 --> 01:05:40,899
[SPEAKER_16]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by President Carfiello.

701
01:05:41,259 --> 01:05:42,240
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

702
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:42,740
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

703
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:43,880
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

704
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:50,801
[SPEAKER_16]: The ayes have it, with Councilors Lungelkern and Marks in opposition.

705
01:05:52,402 --> 01:05:55,962
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor, President, uh, Carfiello.

706
01:05:56,282 --> 01:05:56,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

707
01:05:57,143 --> 01:06:04,284
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, um, before we go on to the next thing, um, seeing that the gentleman before this, uh, had to pay a fine,

708
01:06:04,897 --> 01:06:25,678
[SPEAKER_13]: for a sign violation, I would hope that the code enforcement officer goes out into the square there, because I think there are many other sign violations in the square that he can take care of, and that gentleman shouldn't have been singled out previously when they say there are other violations, and I would hope the code enforcement officer would get out there and take care of the other violations that are in the other windows in the square.

709
01:06:26,638 --> 01:06:26,978
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

710
01:06:27,559 --> 01:06:39,867
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, the, uh, council goes in record as a recommending with this motion, uh, that the, uh, code enforcement officer, uh, be alerted to other violations for signage in the square.

711
01:06:40,448 --> 01:06:40,828
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

712
01:06:41,388 --> 01:06:49,134
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, there will be a public notice of the meeting of the subcommittee, uh, posted on the city's website, uh, or through the clerk's office.

713
01:06:49,554 --> 01:06:56,299
[SPEAKER_16]: If you wish for them to be, um, uh, contact you, uh, to, to bring you in, uh, for that subcommittee meeting.

714
01:06:56,645 --> 01:06:57,625
[SPEAKER_06]: When will that be posted?

715
01:06:59,386 --> 01:07:01,527
[SPEAKER_16]: As soon as the chairman arranges for the meeting.

716
01:07:02,488 --> 01:07:02,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

717
01:07:03,108 --> 01:07:03,448
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

718
01:07:04,308 --> 01:07:04,548
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

719
01:07:04,728 --> 01:07:05,609
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can check that.

720
01:07:06,369 --> 01:07:06,589
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

721
01:07:06,609 --> 01:07:06,949
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

722
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:07,530
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

723
01:07:07,550 --> 01:07:10,711
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.

724
01:07:11,171 --> 01:07:12,452
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

725
01:07:12,512 --> 01:07:14,333
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam, we have one more sign.

726
01:07:14,353 --> 01:07:15,613
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you want to finish that last sign?

727
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:22,096
[SPEAKER_13]: That's fine.

728
01:07:22,116 --> 01:07:22,316
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

729
01:07:22,336 --> 01:07:24,637
[SPEAKER_13]: 17, 452 petition for signed denial reversal by pastor

730
01:07:25,470 --> 01:07:31,033
[SPEAKER_13]: Exend your favor for Evangelical Haitian Church of Somerville, 400 High Street, Medford.

731
01:07:31,413 --> 01:07:33,354
[SPEAKER_13]: OCD number 201713.

732
01:07:35,215 --> 01:07:37,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Size exceed maximum size.

733
01:07:37,857 --> 01:07:38,837
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, sir.

734
01:07:42,159 --> 01:07:43,060
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record.

735
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening.

736
01:07:45,101 --> 01:07:49,583
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much for giving us an opportunity to address the council.

737
01:07:50,283 --> 01:07:53,245
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm pastor of February, and I have

738
01:07:53,625 --> 01:07:56,647
[SPEAKER_07]: I have with me my assistant, Flo, and she.

739
01:07:58,409 --> 01:08:00,670
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, it's 400 High Street, Medford Mass, 02155.

740
01:08:00,811 --> 01:08:05,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

741
01:08:06,135 --> 01:08:13,340
[SPEAKER_13]: The sign that you have there is, looks like it's bigger than the allowable amount allowed by the city.

742
01:08:14,381 --> 01:08:15,502
[SPEAKER_13]: If you see the picture here.

743
01:08:16,483 --> 01:08:18,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

744
01:08:18,604 --> 01:08:20,746
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there's a sign there on the property now,

745
01:08:21,449 --> 01:08:23,410
[SPEAKER_13]: which is, I think that's the law of the size.

746
01:08:23,430 --> 01:08:25,630
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, counselor DelaRusso.

747
01:08:26,491 --> 01:08:45,137
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, Mr. President, I have no objection to this request to move approval on the motion by counselor DelaRusso seconded by councilor Scott Pelly.

748
01:08:46,637 --> 01:08:48,758
[SPEAKER_08]: If I can, I, I, I just,

749
01:08:49,448 --> 01:09:08,331
[SPEAKER_08]: With the recent concerns that we've had in that area with traffic issues, I think would this sign be too big for public safety in the sense that for the traffic and deterring of drivers?

750
01:09:08,391 --> 01:09:18,733
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that that's one of the most dangerous areas we've heard in a long time on this council with that corner with

751
01:09:19,372 --> 01:09:31,864
[SPEAKER_08]: and being such a encompassing sign, I question whether that might be a little too large and a little deterrent for the traffic.

752
01:09:31,884 --> 01:09:43,115
[SPEAKER_08]: I know we want to bring light to your church, and I applaud it, but at the same time, I think public safety has to be addressed in the sense that

753
01:09:43,673 --> 01:09:51,800
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really, I don't know if you've been familiar with that area, with the Brooks School, with the traffic, with the speed at 30 miles an hour.

754
01:09:52,360 --> 01:09:58,345
[SPEAKER_08]: People being deterred to look at such a daunting sign.

755
01:09:59,046 --> 01:10:00,267
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if I can support that.

756
01:10:01,548 --> 01:10:11,116
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what we were thinking about is having people actually reading the sign as they were driving because we figured if the sign

757
01:10:11,932 --> 01:10:14,853
[SPEAKER_11]: is too small, they won't be able to read it at all.

758
01:10:14,913 --> 01:10:19,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the current sign that we have right now is a six by seven sign.

759
01:10:19,815 --> 01:10:25,738
[SPEAKER_11]: And for the past couple of years, we actually have had a summer festival.

760
01:10:26,218 --> 01:10:30,120
[SPEAKER_11]: And people can't even read the sign that we had right there.

761
01:10:30,140 --> 01:10:33,441
[SPEAKER_11]: The day of the festival, people will stop by because they see activity.

762
01:10:34,122 --> 01:10:39,124
[SPEAKER_11]: And they come in, they're like, oh, I didn't even see the sign that you have right now, because it's too far back from the church.

763
01:10:39,744 --> 01:10:42,968
[SPEAKER_11]: And the current sign that we have right now will be in the same position.

764
01:10:43,508 --> 01:10:51,056
[SPEAKER_11]: So we figured people will still kind of maybe because it's back there with the light, they will probably see it back there.

765
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:55,461
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have a big tree, like a huge tree, two big trees.

766
01:10:56,282 --> 01:10:58,024
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you guys have ever seen that property.

767
01:10:58,364 --> 01:11:03,868
[SPEAKER_11]: huge tree in the summer, in the fall, you can even see the current sign that we have back there.

768
01:11:04,289 --> 01:11:08,772
[SPEAKER_11]: We figured maybe with a little light, they may even see a little bit of the sign.

769
01:11:09,592 --> 01:11:21,101
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why we requested that size of five by eight or four by eight maybe will be like a, it's even a smaller size than the one that we have right now.

770
01:11:21,481 --> 01:11:24,984
[SPEAKER_11]: We figured maybe with a little light, it might be a little bit better.

771
01:11:25,342 --> 01:11:28,683
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, if I recall, you also hang banners off that sign.

772
01:11:28,963 --> 01:11:29,423
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

773
01:11:29,643 --> 01:11:31,284
[SPEAKER_11]: And they can't, they can't see it.

774
01:11:31,984 --> 01:11:32,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

775
01:11:32,344 --> 01:11:34,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this is pretty big.

776
01:11:34,865 --> 01:11:39,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, um, you're talking over 11 feet high from ground to the top.

777
01:11:39,466 --> 01:11:44,268
[SPEAKER_08]: So I, you know, is it, were there any other sizes discussed something?

778
01:11:44,288 --> 01:11:44,728
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

779
01:11:44,748 --> 01:11:51,670
[SPEAKER_11]: The four by eight, uh, the current, the current sign that you guys, uh, denied, uh, that's a five by eight.

780
01:11:53,355 --> 01:11:53,975
[SPEAKER_19]: No, the city.

781
01:11:54,035 --> 01:11:54,556
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry.

782
01:11:55,116 --> 01:11:55,816
[SPEAKER_11]: I apologize.

783
01:11:55,836 --> 01:12:02,259
[SPEAKER_11]: The city had denied was the five by eight and on the appeal letter I have mentioned the four by eight.

784
01:12:02,979 --> 01:12:11,323
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, it's actually was cheaper for us anyway because yeah, it was the four by eight was a cheaper price for the pastor.

785
01:12:11,363 --> 01:12:19,206
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, uh, we had asked the, the, the, the sign company if he would do that for us.

786
01:12:19,246 --> 01:12:20,047
[SPEAKER_11]: He says yes.

787
01:12:29,445 --> 01:12:30,005
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

788
01:12:32,126 --> 01:12:32,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Marks.

789
01:12:33,946 --> 01:12:34,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

790
01:12:36,606 --> 01:12:43,628
[SPEAKER_09]: The current sign is from the ground up five by eight, correct?

791
01:12:43,788 --> 01:12:46,468
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, the current sign is six by seven.

792
01:12:46,608 --> 01:12:47,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Six by seven.

793
01:12:47,768 --> 01:12:52,149
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, you've mentioned five different sizes so far, just so you know.

794
01:12:53,009 --> 01:12:54,849
[SPEAKER_11]: The current size is six by seven.

795
01:12:55,090 --> 01:12:55,790
[SPEAKER_09]: Six by seven.

796
01:12:55,970 --> 01:12:56,170
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

797
01:12:58,067 --> 01:13:00,568
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got the original that the church used to use.

798
01:13:00,848 --> 01:13:02,309
[SPEAKER_09]: The one that's currently on the lawn now?

799
01:13:02,449 --> 01:13:02,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

800
01:13:03,069 --> 01:13:04,049
[SPEAKER_09]: It's six by seven?

801
01:13:04,149 --> 01:13:04,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.

802
01:13:04,349 --> 01:13:04,870
[SPEAKER_07]: Six by seven.

803
01:13:06,190 --> 01:13:10,832
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's not elevated on a platform, it's on the ground, six by seven?

804
01:13:10,892 --> 01:13:11,072
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

805
01:13:11,732 --> 01:13:11,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

806
01:13:12,412 --> 01:13:20,716
[SPEAKER_09]: So is there any way that we can bring this sign, because if you look at your top signage, it's very close to conforming.

807
01:13:22,156 --> 01:13:27,158
[SPEAKER_09]: When you add in the pedestal, that's what blows this sign way out of proportion.

808
01:13:27,500 --> 01:13:28,140
[SPEAKER_09]: in my opinion.

809
01:13:29,081 --> 01:13:35,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there any way we can bring that down a little further and shrink the signage similar to what is out there?

810
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:38,045
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no problem making it a little larger.

811
01:13:38,986 --> 01:13:40,287
[SPEAKER_09]: I like the colors of the sign.

812
01:13:40,307 --> 01:13:42,187
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a very nice sign.

813
01:13:42,207 --> 01:13:43,608
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a nice looking sign.

814
01:13:43,948 --> 01:13:46,970
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it matches the area of what you're doing there.

815
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:56,855
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think the fact that your podium that it sits on, or base, is three feet six inches alone,

816
01:13:57,470 --> 01:13:57,670
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

817
01:13:58,230 --> 01:13:59,811
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you have your sign sitting above that.

818
01:13:59,891 --> 01:14:03,812
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes it look like a, a real giant sign in my opinion.

819
01:14:04,632 --> 01:14:12,775
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe if we're able to downsize that a little bit, um, and I have no problem making it larger than what the current ordinance calls for.

820
01:14:13,335 --> 01:14:13,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

821
01:14:13,675 --> 01:14:17,656
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no problem making it a little larger than that because your church is set back.

822
01:14:18,057 --> 01:14:19,337
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think this sign does,

823
01:14:19,853 --> 01:14:23,634
[SPEAKER_09]: represent, hey, we're here, you know, and I agree with that.

824
01:14:24,034 --> 01:14:25,414
[SPEAKER_13]: So if, yes.

825
01:14:25,434 --> 01:14:27,455
[SPEAKER_13]: If I can interrupt you for a second.

826
01:14:28,255 --> 01:14:31,456
[SPEAKER_13]: The zoning board denied the sign.

827
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:32,796
[SPEAKER_13]: They didn't deny this sign.

828
01:14:33,076 --> 01:14:34,136
[SPEAKER_13]: They denied another sign.

829
01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:38,897
[SPEAKER_13]: So this, so I think the first one she mentioned was the five foot sign.

830
01:14:39,058 --> 01:14:39,578
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

831
01:14:39,618 --> 01:14:40,778
[SPEAKER_13]: That was the one denied, so.

832
01:14:40,818 --> 01:14:41,038
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

833
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:45,739
[SPEAKER_13]: Now they're proposing a different sign than what was denied.

834
01:14:46,079 --> 01:14:49,500
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is a whole different sign than what was denied.

835
01:14:49,978 --> 01:14:52,901
[SPEAKER_09]: So this wasn't the sign that was denied?

836
01:14:53,361 --> 01:14:53,582
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

837
01:14:54,002 --> 01:14:54,623
[SPEAKER_09]: The 5-8.

838
01:14:54,683 --> 01:15:00,108
[SPEAKER_13]: The 5-8 was denied, so this one here would have to go through the process all over again, am I correct?

839
01:15:00,809 --> 01:15:02,871
[SPEAKER_09]: So which one's the 5-8, the one on the second page?

840
01:15:03,171 --> 01:15:03,792
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not even here.

841
01:15:03,812 --> 01:15:04,272
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not here?

842
01:15:04,592 --> 01:15:04,833
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

843
01:15:04,853 --> 01:15:05,433
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not even here.

844
01:15:06,534 --> 01:15:07,335
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, this...

845
01:15:08,632 --> 01:15:14,395
[SPEAKER_11]: The 5-8 was the one that was denied, so what we're saying is we can have a smaller size.

846
01:15:14,415 --> 01:15:15,776
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's the one that you're appealing.

847
01:15:16,556 --> 01:15:17,877
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the one we're appealing.

848
01:15:17,937 --> 01:15:18,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

849
01:15:18,277 --> 01:15:18,617
[SPEAKER_11]: The 5-8.

850
01:15:18,818 --> 01:15:20,618
[SPEAKER_13]: So this one here doesn't even come into play.

851
01:15:21,399 --> 01:15:21,959
[SPEAKER_11]: The 5-8?

852
01:15:22,059 --> 01:15:23,640
[SPEAKER_13]: No, this one here, this picture that you're showing.

853
01:15:25,081 --> 01:15:25,881
[SPEAKER_13]: This is 8 by 11.

854
01:15:26,161 --> 01:15:27,002
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no, no, no, no.

855
01:15:27,802 --> 01:15:30,344
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the 5-8 I made copies of.

856
01:15:31,515 --> 01:15:33,237
[SPEAKER_08]: That wasn't a five day.

857
01:15:33,277 --> 01:15:37,300
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's why this, that's why the five day we would, this is 11 feet high.

858
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:38,321
[SPEAKER_13]: You're saying this is a six.

859
01:15:38,361 --> 01:15:39,682
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a six foot tall man here.

860
01:15:40,763 --> 01:15:42,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh gosh, no, no, no.

861
01:15:42,745 --> 01:15:43,245
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not it.

862
01:15:43,726 --> 01:15:44,606
[SPEAKER_07]: That's five eight.

863
01:15:44,646 --> 01:15:50,091
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to look in to put days up for four by five eliminated the pedestal.

864
01:15:50,131 --> 01:15:51,332
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like half size.

865
01:15:53,474 --> 01:15:54,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, hang on one second.

866
01:15:54,835 --> 01:15:55,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my God.

867
01:15:56,136 --> 01:15:56,417
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

868
01:15:56,557 --> 01:15:57,478
[SPEAKER_11]: So where did this come from?

869
01:15:57,578 --> 01:15:57,758
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

870
01:15:58,298 --> 01:15:59,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Where did this come from?

871
01:16:01,284 --> 01:16:03,085
[SPEAKER_09]: I, the city didn't make this up for you.

872
01:16:03,105 --> 01:16:03,345
[SPEAKER_09]: Did it?

873
01:16:03,405 --> 01:16:08,127
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's a handsome six foot gentlemen though.

874
01:16:08,427 --> 01:16:10,708
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, no.

875
01:16:10,748 --> 01:16:18,050
[SPEAKER_11]: But the one that I sent to them, do you have a picture you could pass around to the council?

876
01:16:18,270 --> 01:16:18,610
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

877
01:16:20,051 --> 01:16:24,033
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I think that's a, I think that's the one that I, that's the one that I,

878
01:16:26,092 --> 01:16:27,532
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think that's the one that I sent.

879
01:16:27,552 --> 01:16:28,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, we might as well refer to this.

880
01:16:28,813 --> 01:16:30,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Because you have the 5 by 8, right?

881
01:16:30,913 --> 01:16:31,534
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that the one you have?

882
01:16:31,634 --> 01:16:32,854
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, why don't you do that?

883
01:16:32,894 --> 01:16:33,074
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

884
01:16:33,114 --> 01:16:33,614
[SPEAKER_23]: We have 8 by 11.

885
01:16:34,255 --> 01:16:34,715
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no.

886
01:16:34,895 --> 01:16:36,495
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the one that I meant to send.

887
01:16:36,715 --> 01:16:37,736
[SPEAKER_23]: No, that's the one we have.

888
01:16:38,676 --> 01:16:39,456
[SPEAKER_13]: No, we don't have that one.

889
01:16:40,816 --> 01:16:41,657
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have that one.

890
01:16:41,677 --> 01:16:42,857
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the same one, Rick.

891
01:16:42,917 --> 01:16:43,397
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the same one.

892
01:16:43,897 --> 01:16:44,077
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

893
01:16:44,378 --> 01:16:45,318
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the same exact one.

894
01:16:48,097 --> 01:16:52,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, can we refer this to the subcommittee as well, so we can clarify this?

895
01:16:52,100 --> 01:16:56,422
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to meet very shortly, so we might as well refer this.

896
01:16:56,562 --> 01:16:58,864
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to meet very shortly.

897
01:16:59,384 --> 01:17:09,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing that we have some confusion here with the petitioner, I'm going to ask that we take the suggestion that this be referred to the subcommittee also.

898
01:17:09,951 --> 01:17:11,131
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councillor Knight.

899
01:17:13,733 --> 01:17:14,834
[SPEAKER_13]: We didn't deny anything.

900
01:17:15,194 --> 01:17:23,017
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I give you guys the motion by councilor night.

901
01:17:23,178 --> 01:17:26,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

902
01:17:27,420 --> 01:17:35,483
[SPEAKER_07]: We now decide to buy the side that fall by it, not even five by eight.

903
01:17:35,904 --> 01:17:39,465
[SPEAKER_13]: But there seems to be some confusion in the size of the sign.

904
01:17:40,246 --> 01:17:42,767
[SPEAKER_13]: I think in the subcommittee it would be a lot easier getting it done.

905
01:17:43,511 --> 01:17:46,933
[SPEAKER_13]: If we can, we'll say the setting is a little bit more informal.

906
01:17:47,513 --> 01:17:50,574
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think, I think you, everyone will know exactly what you want.

907
01:17:51,074 --> 01:17:59,979
[SPEAKER_13]: So, uh, uh, although we're going to take council on nights, motion to refer this, uh, to subcommittees seconded by yes.

908
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:09,443
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we're doing is we're going to re we're going to call for a meeting relatively quickly.

909
01:18:09,832 --> 01:18:10,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

910
01:18:10,072 --> 01:18:11,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully, hopefully by next Tuesday.

911
01:18:12,093 --> 01:18:12,333
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

912
01:18:12,353 --> 01:18:25,916
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can, we could see that the five foot sign and the five foot by eight foot sign and we could, we can talk about that in subcommittee and then bring it back out to the floor if everything works out so we can have this done by next week.

913
01:18:25,936 --> 01:18:27,917
[SPEAKER_11]: So put some paperwork back to John.

914
01:18:28,097 --> 01:18:28,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Just so we could see it.

915
01:18:28,957 --> 01:18:29,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

916
01:18:29,157 --> 01:18:29,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

917
01:18:29,417 --> 01:18:33,878
[SPEAKER_13]: But please remember, bring a picture of the sign that you asked for originally.

918
01:18:34,899 --> 01:18:35,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Just bring that to us.

919
01:18:35,879 --> 01:18:36,139
[SPEAKER_08]: When we,

920
01:18:36,735 --> 01:18:45,100
[SPEAKER_08]: City clerk will contact you when we have that subcommittee meeting and you could bring those designs to us for what was denied and we can reverse that.

921
01:18:45,440 --> 01:18:45,700
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

922
01:18:46,001 --> 01:18:46,281
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

923
01:18:46,301 --> 01:18:46,521
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

924
01:18:46,641 --> 01:18:50,463
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

925
01:18:50,603 --> 01:18:51,264
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

926
01:18:52,104 --> 01:18:52,905
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

927
01:18:53,705 --> 01:18:54,085
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

928
01:18:54,105 --> 01:18:56,387
[SPEAKER_13]: While we're under suspension, Councilor Lungo-Kern.

929
01:18:57,623 --> 01:18:59,084
[SPEAKER_23]: paper in the hand of the clerk, please.

930
01:19:02,006 --> 01:19:17,377
[SPEAKER_13]: Offered by Councilor Lungo Kern be it resolved that the Memphis City Council be updated with regards to what permits have been pulled for no parking on South Street and Walnut Street and be provided with an explanation on what transpired today.

931
01:19:18,077 --> 01:19:18,918
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lungo Kern.

932
01:19:19,425 --> 01:19:21,246
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President Carviello.

933
01:19:21,367 --> 01:19:31,054
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm just looking for an update, maybe from the Medford Police Department, as well as the mayor's office, the administration, with regards to permits being pulled.

934
01:19:31,234 --> 01:19:41,142
[SPEAKER_23]: I've received a few text messages, an email, two phone calls, and a Facebook message with regards to residents being upset.

935
01:19:41,262 --> 01:19:49,248
[SPEAKER_23]: There were handwritten letters all around Walnut Street and South Street saying, do not park

936
01:19:50,005 --> 01:19:54,929
[SPEAKER_23]: on Walnut and South, I believe it was sometime today until five o'clock tomorrow.

937
01:19:55,509 --> 01:19:57,731
[SPEAKER_23]: It said violators will be towed.

938
01:19:58,252 --> 01:20:07,279
[SPEAKER_23]: Now residents who live on South and Walnut and obviously have to park there through the night, tonight, were a little upset.

939
01:20:08,219 --> 01:20:10,281
[SPEAKER_23]: Most people didn't even call me first.

940
01:20:10,341 --> 01:20:13,143
[SPEAKER_23]: They called the mayor's office, the police department.

941
01:20:13,223 --> 01:20:19,128
[SPEAKER_23]: Everybody's giving everybody just different information with regards to what's going on, why is there no parking,

942
01:20:19,625 --> 01:20:24,047
[SPEAKER_23]: And then it became an issue with regards to, is this even being done legally?

943
01:20:24,507 --> 01:20:25,728
[SPEAKER_23]: Were the permits pulled?

944
01:20:26,328 --> 01:20:33,452
[SPEAKER_23]: I didn't talk to any of the police department yet, but I have heard through the grapevine that no permits were pulled to post those signs.

945
01:20:34,032 --> 01:20:47,318
[SPEAKER_23]: From what I understand, there is modular homes that were planned on coming down south and looping around down the one way down to Walnut to place the two modular homes on two obviously foundations.

946
01:20:48,967 --> 01:21:00,735
[SPEAKER_23]: So after collecting all of the information today and trying to piece together the puzzle, catch up on what I had missed after work, it was a little late and I'm bringing it up tonight, a little late to call people.

947
01:21:00,795 --> 01:21:04,038
[SPEAKER_23]: I think I got the last of my information about 6.30 this evening.

948
01:21:04,678 --> 01:21:18,608
[SPEAKER_23]: So if we could, as a council, get some updates because there are angry residents, people who are now upset because they feel like it was done incorrectly, to put it lightly.

949
01:21:20,406 --> 01:21:23,229
[SPEAKER_23]: And from what I understand, there were no permits pulled.

950
01:21:23,990 --> 01:21:30,336
[SPEAKER_23]: To bring modular homes, which are very large, pre-FAB homes, down two streets, down a one-way, you need detail.

951
01:21:30,757 --> 01:21:34,901
[SPEAKER_23]: And from what I understand, our police department knew nothing of it.

952
01:21:34,981 --> 01:21:38,084
[SPEAKER_23]: Details weren't hired, and permits were not pulled.

953
01:21:38,865 --> 01:21:40,106
[SPEAKER_23]: I also, from what I understand,

954
01:21:40,735 --> 01:21:46,879
[SPEAKER_23]: didn't get a chance to contact the mayor's office, but a lot of the residents did and the mayor's office may have been lied to.

955
01:21:46,919 --> 01:21:49,020
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not quite sure of the full story.

956
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:56,485
[SPEAKER_23]: So if we could get an update with regards to what permits were pulled, if they weren't pulled for today, were they pulled for a different day?

957
01:21:56,965 --> 01:21:58,266
[SPEAKER_23]: When is this gonna happen?

958
01:22:00,967 --> 01:22:02,248
[SPEAKER_23]: How long is this gonna take?

959
01:22:02,828 --> 01:22:04,529
[SPEAKER_23]: How many detail will we have present?

960
01:22:04,569 --> 01:22:06,270
[SPEAKER_23]: There's obviously a safety concern.

961
01:22:06,671 --> 01:22:07,631
[SPEAKER_23]: There's a parking issue.

962
01:22:07,671 --> 01:22:09,633
[SPEAKER_23]: People wanna be able to park in their own homes.

963
01:22:10,814 --> 01:22:12,114
[SPEAKER_23]: Medcalf Street as well.

964
01:22:12,575 --> 01:22:19,176
[SPEAKER_23]: So we really want to get an idea of, so we can be able to respond to our, you know, to all the residents on those two streets.

965
01:22:19,937 --> 01:22:23,698
[SPEAKER_23]: South is a very long street as well, and people were really, really upset.

966
01:22:23,798 --> 01:22:37,162
[SPEAKER_23]: It affected, I think it went, you know, public, so people all over the community were really upset with what went on and how somebody's allowed to get away with basically lying to the neighborhood if it was so a lie and there were no permits pulled.

967
01:22:37,662 --> 01:22:38,862
[SPEAKER_23]: So I, as one, want to get

968
01:22:39,285 --> 01:22:40,245
[SPEAKER_23]: it all taken care of.

969
01:22:40,405 --> 01:22:54,231
[SPEAKER_23]: If this is gonna happen down the road, we wanna make sure permits are pulled, details in place, and the neighborhood is maybe given advance notice, two, three hour notice to not park or else you're gonna be towed in a handwritten note, really concern people.

970
01:22:54,851 --> 01:23:03,394
[SPEAKER_23]: So if we could get an update from the police department, our chief of police or traffic division, as well as the mayor's office, I think that's necessary.

971
01:23:03,414 --> 01:23:05,395
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

972
01:23:05,435 --> 01:23:05,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

973
01:23:06,576 --> 01:23:07,216
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli.

974
01:23:08,185 --> 01:23:10,806
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate, uh, council Longo current for bringing this up.

975
01:23:10,826 --> 01:23:27,991
[SPEAKER_08]: But, uh, I think if we can add an, uh, add something, uh, an amendment to this, that we also look into how we distribute signs and who distribute signs for, uh, the city during traffic and pocket for other issues and concerns in the roads.

976
01:23:28,031 --> 01:23:33,633
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that, uh, I did talk to a contractor today who said that they actually

977
01:23:34,902 --> 01:23:36,663
[SPEAKER_08]: do this in other areas of the city.

978
01:23:37,323 --> 01:23:44,306
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's really not a department that they can go to that has these signs when they legitimately close the street down.

979
01:23:44,826 --> 01:23:50,628
[SPEAKER_08]: And they actually use City of Boston signs and cross off Boston, put it in Medford.

980
01:23:50,688 --> 01:24:03,793
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we can get some information back from, I don't know if it's the engineering department, if it's the DPW, but if we can get some guidance there, really appreciate it.

981
01:24:04,033 --> 01:24:04,293
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

982
01:24:05,001 --> 01:24:05,561
[SPEAKER_13]: Councillor Neill.

983
01:24:05,901 --> 01:24:07,202
[SPEAKER_13]: Move approval of the question, Mr. President.

984
01:24:09,103 --> 01:24:14,406
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councillor Neill, seconded by... Name and address of the record, please.

985
01:24:14,866 --> 01:24:15,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez.

986
01:24:16,066 --> 01:24:17,347
[SPEAKER_04]: I live at 281 Park Street.

987
01:24:17,867 --> 01:24:29,453
[SPEAKER_04]: I did see a couple of versions of the sign that was supposed to close the street down, and residents were going back and forth, and I received a message from a friend asking me if this was a real sign.

988
01:24:30,337 --> 01:24:32,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Because people weren't sure if it was a real sign.

989
01:24:32,618 --> 01:24:34,760
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they had to stop parking there at 5 p.m.

990
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:36,020
[SPEAKER_04]: today till 8 p.m.

991
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:39,242
[SPEAKER_04]: tomorrow, that was certainly a hardship for people that live in that area.

992
01:24:39,563 --> 01:24:43,645
[SPEAKER_04]: And who wants to try to rearrange your life if it's not a real sign?

993
01:24:44,125 --> 01:24:50,209
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did, in fact, go in person to the mayor's office, and I was helped by Ms.

994
01:24:50,249 --> 01:24:52,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Lauren Felch, who was extremely helpful.

995
01:24:52,570 --> 01:24:56,453
[SPEAKER_04]: She pulled up the flyer, she called the developer, and

996
01:24:57,493 --> 01:25:08,777
[SPEAKER_04]: Who she believes was the developer was the number on the flyer was not a city number and was told that in fact they had gotten all the permissions that they needed and that the home would be being moved tomorrow.

997
01:25:09,437 --> 01:25:11,257
[SPEAKER_04]: And it would be coming in at 7 AM.

998
01:25:11,778 --> 01:25:12,758
[SPEAKER_04]: She asked him why.

999
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:16,349
[SPEAKER_04]: People weren't allowed to park there at 5 p.m., and he wasn't sure.

1000
01:25:17,150 --> 01:25:27,659
[SPEAKER_04]: And when she concluded the call, I asked her if it was possible if she could confirm that there were permissions granted, and if there were permissions, if the city could send out a reverse 911 call.

1001
01:25:27,959 --> 01:25:34,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it was really important that people knew that this really was happening, and this wasn't a sign, a fake sign that had been put up.

1002
01:25:35,005 --> 01:25:35,305
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ms.

1003
01:25:35,345 --> 01:25:41,791
[SPEAKER_04]: Felch had expressed that, you know, a year prior, someone had put up signs that said street cleaning was happening in some neighborhood that were handwritten.

1004
01:25:42,450 --> 01:25:44,651
[SPEAKER_04]: And people had moved and it turned out to not be true.

1005
01:25:44,711 --> 01:25:48,754
[SPEAKER_04]: So she understood that a lot of people probably wouldn't believe this was a real sign.

1006
01:25:49,274 --> 01:25:57,719
[SPEAKER_04]: The last information that I received when she called back after she had called various offices was that the project was halted for now.

1007
01:25:57,939 --> 01:26:01,381
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyone that lives in that area can park in that area.

1008
01:26:01,441 --> 01:26:05,363
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll be able to go to work in the morning because the house is not being moved now.

1009
01:26:05,883 --> 01:26:09,546
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my understanding that this is not the first home that he has moved in this way.

1010
01:26:10,027 --> 01:26:13,429
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm curious to know if he's violating some sort of rule.

1011
01:26:13,489 --> 01:26:20,355
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a department that's supposed to oversee when these homes are being moved, if streets are being closed off?

1012
01:26:20,816 --> 01:26:22,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Is safety being factored in?

1013
01:26:22,257 --> 01:26:27,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Had this home been moving through the neighborhood at 7 o'clock in the morning, school children would be out and about.

1014
01:26:27,841 --> 01:26:29,163
[SPEAKER_04]: People would be trying to go to work.

1015
01:26:29,543 --> 01:26:34,247
[SPEAKER_04]: People would be going into their cars to get out of their driveway and find out that they can't leave.

1016
01:26:35,147 --> 01:26:38,529
[SPEAKER_04]: And if this has happened before and we didn't know about it, shame on us.

1017
01:26:39,150 --> 01:26:42,872
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope that you all can look into it and find out what the process is.

1018
01:26:43,312 --> 01:26:49,575
[SPEAKER_04]: This developer does own two to three more parcels in the city planning on doing similar things to those parcels.

1019
01:26:50,076 --> 01:27:03,263
[SPEAKER_04]: So it would be great if he could have a plan from the city on exactly what he is supposed to do step by step before he moves a modular home into our community so that we don't have someone get hurt or miss work or anything.

1020
01:27:03,930 --> 01:27:04,290
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1021
01:27:04,430 --> 01:27:04,770
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1022
01:27:07,191 --> 01:27:08,332
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

1023
01:27:09,192 --> 01:27:10,793
[SPEAKER_21]: Gene Newsell, 35 Power Street.

1024
01:27:11,593 --> 01:27:17,056
[SPEAKER_21]: So I've been following this issue on social media, and I think that

1025
01:27:18,829 --> 01:27:21,210
[SPEAKER_21]: What we have here is a systematic issue.

1026
01:27:21,831 --> 01:27:37,099
[SPEAKER_21]: And this all stems back, in my opinion, to the fact that these individuals coming into our city to flip properties are not encouraged nor are they required to engage with the neighborhoods that they're working in.

1027
01:27:37,619 --> 01:28:06,109
[SPEAKER_21]: Because they know they'll go to our ZBA they'll get whatever their variances are regardless of what our residents have to say and This is just a complete lack of respect for the people in the neighborhood, you know working in the industry If you asked anybody who is truly involved in the industry and not someone who's just flipping properties, but large-scale developers commercial high-end residential large-scale residential

1028
01:28:06,792 --> 01:28:12,756
[SPEAKER_21]: They wouldn't dream of doing something like this without some type of community meeting to advise people of what's going on.

1029
01:28:13,817 --> 01:28:21,062
[SPEAKER_21]: They wouldn't come down these streets without the proper details in place and logistics in place.

1030
01:28:21,182 --> 01:28:25,064
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm not speaking specifically about this developer.

1031
01:28:25,444 --> 01:28:26,505
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm speaking in general.

1032
01:28:27,966 --> 01:28:31,807
[SPEAKER_21]: If you walk around and you speak with people, this is happening everywhere.

1033
01:28:32,067 --> 01:28:42,070
[SPEAKER_21]: Folks are coming in, they're executing their construction projects, and they're not keeping the folks around involved and informed as to what's happening.

1034
01:28:42,230 --> 01:28:46,111
[SPEAKER_21]: It doesn't matter if it's a single unit, three units, or 490.

1035
01:28:47,811 --> 01:28:53,036
[SPEAKER_21]: When you're building and you're around people, you have a responsibility to advise them.

1036
01:28:53,517 --> 01:28:57,360
[SPEAKER_21]: And so I can appreciate that there are time constraints.

1037
01:28:57,460 --> 01:29:05,388
[SPEAKER_21]: Perhaps the developer didn't have as much lead time for this delivery, but I feel if we did a better job,

1038
01:29:05,868 --> 01:29:24,643
[SPEAKER_21]: at making sure that folks coming into our city to build, whatever it is, engaged with the people they would be working around and working in their neighborhoods where their homes are, things like this would not be happening and we wouldn't have folks as upset and concerned as they have been.

1039
01:29:25,544 --> 01:29:29,627
[SPEAKER_21]: So I would hope that we would look at this as a larger issue.

1040
01:29:29,647 --> 01:29:31,109
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it ties

1041
01:29:31,990 --> 01:29:46,326
[SPEAKER_21]: To you how we engage and how we communicate across the board With all of these various projects not this particular neighborhood not this particular developer, but overall there's really no mechanism that truly reaches

1042
01:29:47,006 --> 01:30:14,281
[SPEAKER_21]: Reaches everybody and I think that I would ask you guys as you discuss this further and look into it further that you think about This issue because as I said I think that if we had those vehicles in place and we had those opportunities for some of these community meetings I'm getting folks engaged in their neighborhoods to these people We we would do better and maybe feel a little bit more comfortable with what's going on Thanks.

1043
01:30:14,682 --> 01:30:14,942
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you

1044
01:30:16,033 --> 01:30:18,194
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Knight to move the question.

1045
01:30:23,315 --> 01:30:23,956
[SPEAKER_23]: Councilor Locker?

1046
01:30:23,996 --> 01:30:25,156
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1047
01:30:25,296 --> 01:30:28,177
[SPEAKER_23]: Briefly, if we could just amend this and ask, what is the procedure?

1048
01:30:28,217 --> 01:30:31,638
[SPEAKER_23]: What would someone have to do to move a modular home in Medford?

1049
01:30:32,058 --> 01:30:36,000
[SPEAKER_23]: If there is a procedure out there, if we could maybe get a copy of that, that'd be great.

1050
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:36,500
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1051
01:30:36,580 --> 01:30:39,101
[SPEAKER_23]: I move approval, second the approval and move approval.

[SPEAKER_14]: Can the clerk please read back

[SPEAKER_14]: the resolution and amendments.

[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, would you please read back the resolution?

1057
01:30:52,332 --> 01:30:58,255
[SPEAKER_15]: I can hear be resolved.

1058
01:30:58,275 --> 01:31:11,840
[SPEAKER_15]: The Memphis city council be updated with regards to what permits have been pulled for no parking on South street and Walnut street and be provided with an explanation on what transpired today.

1059
01:31:12,939 --> 01:31:25,706
[SPEAKER_15]: And we have an amendment by a council Scott Pelly on, um, how the distribution of signs, uh, works in the city for, uh, for other issues on the roadway.

1060
01:31:25,726 --> 01:31:33,209
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course, uh, council along current is a procedure on, uh, moving modular housing, modular homes.

[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_13]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

1079
01:32:02,473 --> 01:32:05,674
Mr. President, I would suspend you to take paper 17455 out of order.

1080
01:32:07,535 --> 01:32:08,735
[SPEAKER_13]: Communications from the mayor. 17455.

1081
01:32:14,443 --> 01:32:22,645
[SPEAKER_13]: Dear Mr. President and City Councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that Your Honorable Body approve the following resolution.

1082
01:32:23,585 --> 01:32:27,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, a motion to waive the reading and a brief synopsis by the Director of the Board of Health.

1083
01:32:27,826 --> 01:32:28,086
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1084
01:32:28,146 --> 01:32:36,488
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Knight to waive the reading and if the Board of Health Director could give a brief synopsis, we'd appreciate it.

1085
01:32:36,708 --> 01:32:37,628
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record.

1086
01:32:38,069 --> 01:32:40,769
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm Marian O'Connor, Director of the Board of Health, Medford.

1087
01:32:41,889 --> 01:32:43,730
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for having us tonight.

1088
01:32:45,477 --> 01:32:57,907
[SPEAKER_17]: FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Region 1, has completed its review of Medford's hazard mitigation plan and found it approvable pending adoption by this honorable body.

1089
01:32:59,868 --> 01:33:08,755
[SPEAKER_17]: It's my understanding that upon adoption, a formal letter will be sent from FEMA, which will be in effect for five years.

1090
01:33:09,536 --> 01:33:12,478
[SPEAKER_17]: This formal approval will confirm Medford's eligibility

1091
01:33:12,949 --> 01:33:16,350
[SPEAKER_17]: to apply for mitigation grants administered by FEMA.

1092
01:33:17,290 --> 01:33:23,152
[SPEAKER_17]: If not adopted, we would have to update the entire plan and submit again for FEMA review.

1093
01:33:24,332 --> 01:33:26,933
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, you know, this has been a very long process.

1094
01:33:27,613 --> 01:33:36,675
[SPEAKER_17]: And I have with me Martin Pillsbury, who is with the Metropolitan Area Planning Commission, who has been involved in this process for several years.

1095
01:33:37,756 --> 01:33:40,136
[SPEAKER_17]: It took several years for this plan to get approved.

1096
01:33:40,416 --> 01:33:41,617
[SPEAKER_13]: If I could interrupt you for a minute.

1097
01:33:41,897 --> 01:33:42,257
[SPEAKER_13]: Excuse me.

1098
01:33:42,983 --> 01:33:43,263
[SPEAKER_13]: please.

1099
01:33:43,343 --> 01:33:44,924
[SPEAKER_13]: We have other people speaking here.

1100
01:33:44,964 --> 01:33:45,264
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1101
01:33:47,365 --> 01:33:53,126
[SPEAKER_17]: So Mr. Pillsbury could address any specific plans about the, uh, questions about the plan itself.

1102
01:33:55,207 --> 01:33:55,727
[SPEAKER_14]: Counselor nice.

1103
01:33:56,428 --> 01:33:57,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1104
01:33:57,628 --> 01:33:59,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. O'Connor, thank you for being here this evening.

1105
01:33:59,669 --> 01:34:11,993
[SPEAKER_14]: Uh, also to you, um, Mr. Pillsbury, um, question that I have would be, um, whereas you're coming from the metropolitan area planning council, um, I'm sure that you have,

1106
01:34:12,747 --> 01:34:16,008
[SPEAKER_14]: a vast exposure to a number of these type of plans in our surrounding communities.

1107
01:34:16,428 --> 01:34:22,470
[SPEAKER_14]: So the first question that I'd ask would be, how does this plan measure up to those plans that are established in surrounding communities, number one?

1108
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:32,312
[SPEAKER_14]: And number two, is there a regional focus that's taken when these plans are put together so that if a disaster does strike or has a dust strike and there needs to be mitigation, is there a regional response or is it more of a local response?

1109
01:34:33,393 --> 01:34:33,733
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1110
01:34:33,773 --> 01:34:34,873
[SPEAKER_24]: Very good questions indeed.

1111
01:34:35,793 --> 01:34:42,375
[SPEAKER_24]: In fact, most of your neighboring, many of your neighboring cities and towns have recently been through the same process of developing a plan.

1112
01:34:43,187 --> 01:34:47,651
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm expecting this is going to be in front of the city of Malden sometime in the next few weeks as well.

1113
01:34:48,231 --> 01:34:55,077
[SPEAKER_24]: And in the last less than a year or so, it came up and was approved in Somerville, Cambridge, Everett, Chelsea.

1114
01:34:55,597 --> 01:35:02,763
[SPEAKER_24]: This was part of a regional group of eight cities and towns that originally came together to do an update of your plans.

1115
01:35:02,823 --> 01:35:08,928
[SPEAKER_24]: And I should say that this is an update to your original hazard mitigation plan, which was adopted back in 2008.

1116
01:35:09,188 --> 01:35:11,050
[SPEAKER_24]: That was the first of these kinds of plans.

1117
01:35:11,070 --> 01:35:12,631
[SPEAKER_24]: The program was new at the time.

1118
01:35:13,234 --> 01:35:18,076
[SPEAKER_24]: And the way FEMA has structured this, the plans need to be renewed on a periodic basis.

1119
01:35:18,137 --> 01:35:23,739
[SPEAKER_24]: So this is your first renewal of your original plan, and as was also the case for all of your neighboring communities.

1120
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:28,162
[SPEAKER_24]: Basically, FEMA is very prescriptive about what goes in these plans.

1121
01:35:28,182 --> 01:35:33,304
[SPEAKER_24]: There are literally codes of federal regulations that say, here's what the chapters and sections of the plan need to be.

1122
01:35:33,805 --> 01:35:40,168
[SPEAKER_24]: So your plans are very equivalent to your neighbor's plans, because they pretty much all have to, in order to get FEMA approval, they will have to follow sort

1123
01:35:41,650 --> 01:35:43,272
[SPEAKER_24]: a similar consistent format.

1124
01:35:44,733 --> 01:35:46,714
[SPEAKER_14]: And one other question, Mr. President.

1125
01:35:46,754 --> 01:35:55,660
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Pillsbury, you are a professional in the field of environmental planning, and I don't know where you live, but with this plan in place, would you feel safe and comfortable living in the city of Medford?

1126
01:35:56,340 --> 01:35:56,881
[SPEAKER_24]: Absolutely.

1127
01:35:56,941 --> 01:35:59,022
[SPEAKER_24]: I think this plan will really help the city.

1128
01:35:59,642 --> 01:36:10,830
[SPEAKER_24]: You'll see that it outlines a number of steps you can take over the next five years to put in place improvements to your infrastructure and drainage that would mitigate the kinds of flooding that you have.

1129
01:36:11,572 --> 01:36:18,258
[SPEAKER_24]: And I should add that it was mentioned that when you have a plan like this approved, that makes the city eligible for FEMA grants.

1130
01:36:18,658 --> 01:36:27,325
[SPEAKER_24]: And in fact, under your previous plan, the city did get a FEMA grant for work at Wright's Pond Dam, which was over a half a million dollar grant from FEMA.

1131
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:34,931
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's the kind of project, and there are a number of suggested projects in this plan that could be looked at in the next five years, some of which may be eligible for similar FEMA grants.

1132
01:36:35,751 --> 01:36:35,932
[SPEAKER_14]: Excellent.

1133
01:36:36,312 --> 01:36:37,313
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1134
01:36:37,353 --> 01:36:40,215
[SPEAKER_14]: Based upon the discussion here, I feel comfortable

1135
01:36:40,565 --> 01:36:42,286
[SPEAKER_14]: voting in favor of this matter this evening.

1136
01:36:42,967 --> 01:36:43,607
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

1137
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:45,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1138
01:36:45,408 --> 01:36:50,612
[SPEAKER_03]: You had mentioned a minute ago that there's a periodic renewal.

1139
01:36:50,932 --> 01:36:52,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it every so many years?

1140
01:36:52,593 --> 01:36:53,014
[SPEAKER_24]: Five years.

1141
01:36:53,434 --> 01:36:54,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Every five years?

1142
01:36:54,115 --> 01:36:55,495
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1143
01:36:55,736 --> 01:36:57,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it usually take as long as this took?

1144
01:36:58,458 --> 01:36:59,618
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like this was a bit lengthy.

1145
01:36:59,638 --> 01:37:02,380
[SPEAKER_24]: This took longer than average in a couple of your neighboring cities.

1146
01:37:03,221 --> 01:37:06,063
[SPEAKER_24]: Got into a situation here where FEMA at the national level

1147
01:37:06,508 --> 01:37:11,729
[SPEAKER_24]: right in the middle of this process, changed the rules, basically, and changed the guidelines.

1148
01:37:11,909 --> 01:37:16,750
[SPEAKER_24]: And basically, we were thinking, OK, they're not going to change horses in midstream.

1149
01:37:16,790 --> 01:37:18,490
[SPEAKER_24]: We started the plan under the old guidelines.

1150
01:37:18,530 --> 01:37:22,191
[SPEAKER_24]: But no, in fact, they insisted that the plan kind of be upgraded to the new.

1151
01:37:22,471 --> 01:37:32,032
[SPEAKER_24]: And actually, it makes a better plan, because the change of guidelines that FEMA put in place was based on national experience over the first decade or so of this program.

1152
01:37:32,052 --> 01:37:34,853
[SPEAKER_24]: So it actually made the plan better, but it also required

1153
01:37:35,395 --> 01:37:40,478
[SPEAKER_24]: more extensive review, and the review of the draft plan has to go through two levels of review.

1154
01:37:40,678 --> 01:37:44,540
[SPEAKER_24]: It goes through MEMA, the Mass Emergency Management Agency, and then also through FEMA.

1155
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:48,042
[SPEAKER_24]: And in this case, because of the change in rules, it went through that process twice.

1156
01:37:48,102 --> 01:37:55,566
[SPEAKER_24]: So it took longer to get through to the end of the process, but you have now got the approval letter from FEMA, and it's all over except for shouting, as they say.

1157
01:37:55,826 --> 01:37:55,906
[SPEAKER_24]: OK.

1158
01:37:56,387 --> 01:37:57,027
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1159
01:37:59,688 --> 01:38:00,349
[SPEAKER_23]: Council Member Kern.

1160
01:38:00,789 --> 01:38:02,470
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1161
01:38:03,245 --> 01:38:05,868
[SPEAKER_23]: and thank you for coming to explain everything to us.

1162
01:38:06,468 --> 01:38:16,738
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, from what I understand after reading some of the report, this is meetings that took place in Medford from 2000 to around 2012, 2013 to the present and then was put together.

1163
01:38:16,779 --> 01:38:25,447
[SPEAKER_23]: And I, as you had just spoken about is mainly a flooding is the main, obviously storms, hurricanes, things like that we're concerned about.

1164
01:38:26,188 --> 01:38:26,248
[SPEAKER_23]: Um,

1165
01:38:27,174 --> 01:38:37,697
[SPEAKER_23]: my, my main question really would be to the, to the city with regards to making sure this, this was a hundred page document, I believe, and making sure it's like on the city website so people can access it.

1166
01:38:37,737 --> 01:38:42,098
[SPEAKER_23]: I think it's important to be able to get the answer questions answered.

1167
01:38:42,238 --> 01:38:51,500
[SPEAKER_23]: We can't talk about it all tonight, the hundred pages, but are there any specific points that you think are important for the public to know?

1168
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:51,560
[SPEAKER_23]: Um,

1169
01:38:52,737 --> 01:38:55,939
[SPEAKER_23]: obviously live tonight, but then also we want to make sure it's on the website.

1170
01:38:55,979 --> 01:38:58,000
[SPEAKER_24]: We will absolutely make it available.

1171
01:38:58,040 --> 01:39:01,402
[SPEAKER_24]: I have a hard copy here, but it's available as a PDF that can be put on the website.

1172
01:39:01,442 --> 01:39:09,827
[SPEAKER_24]: In fact, when it was a draft and we had the public meetings, that draft was put on the website and was available for public comment during the production of the plan.

1173
01:39:09,907 --> 01:39:13,008
[SPEAKER_24]: But now that it's finalized, you want everyone to know what's in there.

1174
01:39:13,489 --> 01:39:19,432
[SPEAKER_24]: I guess I would say if anyone gets a chance to look at this a little bit later on, once it's up online, to look at the tables near the back of the plan,

1175
01:39:20,034 --> 01:39:25,336
[SPEAKER_24]: table 28 that actually lists the recommended measures, different drainage improvements and other steps.

1176
01:39:25,396 --> 01:39:34,698
[SPEAKER_24]: That's really the heart of the plan saying, here's the things you can actually do that would make the city more resilient and less vulnerable to some of these hazards.

1177
01:39:35,759 --> 01:39:36,099
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1178
01:39:36,959 --> 01:39:37,279
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1179
01:39:38,019 --> 01:39:38,599
[SPEAKER_13]: Counselor box.

1180
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:40,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1181
01:39:40,460 --> 01:39:42,300
[SPEAKER_09]: And I too went through the report.

1182
01:39:43,001 --> 01:39:44,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I can remember last time was presented.

1183
01:39:45,001 --> 01:39:47,802
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, we actually had a committee, the whole meeting,

1184
01:39:48,432 --> 01:39:48,872
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1185
01:39:48,932 --> 01:39:53,236
[SPEAKER_09]: And we discussed this with the entire council because it is such an in depth report.

1186
01:39:53,917 --> 01:39:56,239
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, there's many facets to this report.

1187
01:39:56,900 --> 01:40:01,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, my, my question is to you, uh, you just mentioned, uh, recommendations and you're right.

1188
01:40:01,704 --> 01:40:06,368
[SPEAKER_09]: There are recommendations that were in the last five year plan that are still carried over.

1189
01:40:06,812 --> 01:40:08,232
[SPEAKER_09]: into the next plan tomorrow.

1190
01:40:08,252 --> 01:40:08,772
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1191
01:40:08,993 --> 01:40:09,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of them are.

1192
01:40:10,253 --> 01:40:15,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I can remember the last several budgets that have come before this council.

1193
01:40:15,994 --> 01:40:27,637
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't recall anything the administration has brought before us to be quite frank with you, uh, in ways of allocations to, uh, address some of the recommendations that were made in the last report.

1194
01:40:28,074 --> 01:40:33,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Now that may have happened and I'm not aware of it, but I don't remember anything in the budgetary process.

1195
01:40:34,539 --> 01:40:37,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, when I looked at, uh, I forget what section it was under.

1196
01:40:37,281 --> 01:40:39,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I believe it was recommendations.

1197
01:40:39,342 --> 01:40:42,104
[SPEAKER_09]: They scaled it high, moderate and low.

1198
01:40:42,585 --> 01:40:43,025
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1199
01:40:43,125 --> 01:40:52,272
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether it was a high benefit to do this particular project or what the risk was, um, uh, you know, and based on high, low or moderate.

1200
01:40:52,712 --> 01:40:56,015
[SPEAKER_09]: Now the areas of concern that I have that have been of concern for many years

1201
01:40:56,475 --> 01:41:04,101
[SPEAKER_09]: in this community are Main Street and Mystic Ave, in between, the whole neighborhood in between Mystic Ave and Main Street.

1202
01:41:04,701 --> 01:41:09,624
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was considered, I believe, a very high priority due to poor drainage.

1203
01:41:10,865 --> 01:41:18,131
[SPEAKER_09]: The same also applies to some sections of North Method, which we refer to the Heights, which also have poor drainage.

1204
01:41:19,652 --> 01:41:25,636
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to make sure that we're not just putting out a report for the sake of putting out a report

1205
01:41:26,184 --> 01:41:35,410
[SPEAKER_09]: and hopefully getting some funding and don't, we always welcome funding, especially from the federal government, but I just hope it's not a report that really has no tea to it.

1206
01:41:36,030 --> 01:41:47,837
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd like to see, we have over $7 million in our water and sewer enterprise account for these exact projects for drainage issues, uh, for, um, issues that,

1207
01:41:48,344 --> 01:41:50,626
[SPEAKER_09]: I think could be addressed with some of that money.

1208
01:41:51,287 --> 01:41:58,153
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know if you can address that or not, but my concern is, you know, the flooding.

1209
01:41:58,813 --> 01:42:05,759
[SPEAKER_09]: I know some of the recommendations were as simple as we're notifying businesses to clean their catch basins on private property.

1210
01:42:06,300 --> 01:42:11,644
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, that sounds like a no-brainer, but what percent of people adhere to that?

1211
01:42:11,864 --> 01:42:13,125
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, is there any follow-up?

1212
01:42:14,226 --> 01:42:15,908
[SPEAKER_09]: I could tell you the catch basins on streets,

1213
01:42:16,468 --> 01:42:22,912
[SPEAKER_09]: even though they're supposedly cleaned once a year, they're in deplorable conditions throughout the community, to be quite frank with you.

1214
01:42:23,772 --> 01:42:29,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Many of them are clogged and in very poor condition, which leads to additional flooding.

1215
01:42:29,295 --> 01:42:44,744
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm hoping that it's not just a report in name only, that these recommendations are taken seriously by this administration, and they put forth, if we don't get grants, funding in the budget to address some of these very serious

1216
01:42:45,702 --> 01:42:52,108
[SPEAKER_09]: drainage issues, because when your basement has a foot of water in it, that's a very major concern for a lot of residents.

1217
01:42:52,508 --> 01:43:02,557
[SPEAKER_09]: And when I'm at meetings in the Heights, and a woman's telling me up around Tamar Drive that her water pump runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, I'm concerned.

1218
01:43:02,978 --> 01:43:05,400
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, those are concerning issues.

1219
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:08,002
[SPEAKER_24]: So I don't know if you can address that in particular.

1220
01:43:08,022 --> 01:43:08,222
[SPEAKER_24]: Right.

1221
01:43:08,863 --> 01:43:11,605
[SPEAKER_24]: Vice President Marx, let me say that that's music to my ears.

1222
01:43:11,705 --> 01:43:12,246
[SPEAKER_24]: As a planner,

1223
01:43:12,670 --> 01:43:19,832
[SPEAKER_24]: The thing we worry about most is trying our best to make a good plan and then having it proverbially gather dust on the shelf because no one implements it.

1224
01:43:20,232 --> 01:43:30,495
[SPEAKER_24]: So you're right on target to what, now you have a good plan here, it's been looked at by a lot of eyes and through FEMA and MEMA, and now it's really on the city to, over the next five years, implement parts of this plan.

1225
01:43:30,815 --> 01:43:36,896
[SPEAKER_24]: Now, on the positive side, this plan did go back and look at the recommendations made in your last plan and said, what happened to them?

1226
01:43:36,936 --> 01:43:38,517
[SPEAKER_24]: And there's a table right in here.

1227
01:43:38,977 --> 01:43:40,017
[SPEAKER_24]: Some of them were completed.

1228
01:43:40,705 --> 01:43:48,592
[SPEAKER_24]: And those that weren't completed, for whatever reason, there wasn't enough funding or whatever the reason may be, we re-looked at them and say, are these still relevant recommendations?

1229
01:43:48,612 --> 01:43:49,273
[SPEAKER_24]: They haven't been done.

1230
01:43:49,293 --> 01:43:50,273
[SPEAKER_24]: Should they be carried in?

1231
01:43:50,674 --> 01:43:51,474
[SPEAKER_24]: And they were.

1232
01:43:51,975 --> 01:43:53,716
[SPEAKER_24]: We also added some new recommendations.

1233
01:43:53,776 --> 01:44:02,864
[SPEAKER_24]: But over the course of the next five years, the idea is that you don't just sort of set this aside and wait for five years to come and renew the plan for the sake of just having a plan.

1234
01:44:03,185 --> 01:44:06,788
[SPEAKER_24]: There's actually a process in the back spelled out by which the city would continue

1235
01:44:07,489 --> 01:44:22,783
[SPEAKER_24]: occasionally convene this group that helped to put the plan together because it's a very interdisciplinary effort, has lots of different departments and commissions and boards involved, and it's a vision that you would over time take from these recommendations and move some of them ahead as you can, whether it's through a FEMA grant

1236
01:44:23,513 --> 01:44:24,914
[SPEAKER_24]: or through your own city funding.

1237
01:44:24,934 --> 01:44:33,278
[SPEAKER_24]: And the table in here actually spells out where some of these might have to just be city funding because they're important, but they may not all be eligible for FEMA money.

1238
01:44:33,938 --> 01:44:40,081
[SPEAKER_24]: And even those that are eligible for FEMA funding, FEMA requires a 25% local match for all of their grants.

1239
01:44:40,101 --> 01:44:46,324
[SPEAKER_24]: They'll pay you 75% of a cost, but you still have to be prepared to put up something as well for those grants.

1240
01:44:46,484 --> 01:44:52,787
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's very important what you say about keeping the implementation of this and making sure that it's not just a plan that gathers dust.

1241
01:44:53,538 --> 01:44:55,139
[SPEAKER_09]: So just if I can ask you my last question.

1242
01:44:55,899 --> 01:44:57,560
[SPEAKER_09]: So FEMA requires the report.

1243
01:44:58,241 --> 01:45:00,282
[SPEAKER_09]: It requires cities and towns to present.

1244
01:45:00,782 --> 01:45:02,823
[SPEAKER_24]: If I could answer that, they actually don't require.

1245
01:45:02,863 --> 01:45:05,124
[SPEAKER_24]: This is not a mandate like an unfunded mandate.

1246
01:45:05,525 --> 01:45:08,246
[SPEAKER_24]: They require, what they do is they put the incentive in.

1247
01:45:08,406 --> 01:45:12,108
[SPEAKER_24]: If you want any FEMA grants under this program, you have to have an approved plan.

1248
01:45:12,268 --> 01:45:13,249
[SPEAKER_24]: So it's an incentive.

1249
01:45:14,169 --> 01:45:20,893
[SPEAKER_24]: If you didn't ever care about getting a FEMA grant, you wouldn't have to do one of these plans and there would be no penalty other than that.

1250
01:45:22,755 --> 01:45:28,536
[SPEAKER_09]: associated timeline that FEMA puts out saying, you know what, okay, these are your recommendations, Matthew.

1251
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:30,197
[SPEAKER_09]: We appreciate you putting together this report.

1252
01:45:30,517 --> 01:45:32,077
[SPEAKER_09]: You're eligible for grant funding now.

1253
01:45:32,497 --> 01:45:42,220
[SPEAKER_09]: However, we would like to see a percentage of these particular recommendations implemented by X date or at least reviewed by... You're asking some very good questions.

1254
01:45:42,240 --> 01:45:47,261
[SPEAKER_24]: The table of recommendations actually puts some target dates on when over the five years.

1255
01:45:47,461 --> 01:45:49,101
[SPEAKER_24]: Would this one be in the first year or two?

1256
01:45:49,421 --> 01:45:51,922
[SPEAKER_24]: Would this one be in year three or this one be in year five?

1257
01:45:52,324 --> 01:45:57,567
[SPEAKER_24]: You actually have that in there based on the city's team's best estimate of when some of these would be.

1258
01:45:57,927 --> 01:46:04,310
[SPEAKER_24]: But I will say that in the interim five years, FEMA does not come back and look over your shoulder and say, now are you making progress?

1259
01:46:04,711 --> 01:46:12,335
[SPEAKER_24]: When you come and do your next five-year update, however, that's when you'll have to kind of the day of reckoning will come to say, what did you do with this over the last five years?

1260
01:46:12,355 --> 01:46:14,196
[SPEAKER_24]: And did you, what did you implement and what didn't you?

1261
01:46:14,716 --> 01:46:16,517
[SPEAKER_24]: So that's the time when it will come.

1262
01:46:16,877 --> 01:46:19,519
[SPEAKER_24]: You don't want to wait until the last minute and be caught up short.

1263
01:46:20,079 --> 01:46:22,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you ever seen FEMA deny a report?

1264
01:46:23,170 --> 01:46:24,591
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, well, the plan.

1265
01:46:24,911 --> 01:46:27,473
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you ever seen FEMA deny one?

1266
01:46:28,453 --> 01:46:29,754
[SPEAKER_24]: They don't use the term deny.

1267
01:46:29,814 --> 01:46:35,498
[SPEAKER_24]: What they have done is returned draft plans with revisions required.

1268
01:46:35,938 --> 01:46:39,020
[SPEAKER_24]: And that's actually part of what happened here because of the change in regulations.

1269
01:46:39,080 --> 01:46:43,623
[SPEAKER_24]: The plan that was originally submitted met the old regulations but didn't meet the new ones.

1270
01:46:43,743 --> 01:46:46,925
[SPEAKER_24]: And so they will often return these plans basically with revisions.

1271
01:46:47,005 --> 01:46:51,368
[SPEAKER_24]: It's like turning in a paper to your professor and getting it marked up and say, go back and fix this.

1272
01:46:52,264 --> 01:46:57,667
[SPEAKER_24]: but that's in the interest of making a better plan, not to be punitive to the community, to making a better, more complete plan.

1273
01:46:58,347 --> 01:47:01,549
[SPEAKER_09]: And just Mr. President, my other question is to the board of health director.

1274
01:47:02,149 --> 01:47:12,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, now that you are acting, I guess, full time or part time as the emergency preparedness person in the community where we used to have someone that did it as their job.

1275
01:47:13,275 --> 01:47:17,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, although it may not have been a full time job, that was what they were dedicated to do.

1276
01:47:18,775 --> 01:47:25,877
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you finding that now, in your role, a very busy office at Border Health, a number of employees underneath you, a lot of issues.

1277
01:47:26,357 --> 01:47:31,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you finding yourself being able to spend ample time as the emergency preparedness person for this community?

1278
01:47:32,579 --> 01:47:35,100
[SPEAKER_17]: I think you could spend a lot more time doing it.

1279
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:36,980
[SPEAKER_17]: It certainly could be a full-time job.

1280
01:47:37,020 --> 01:47:41,581
[SPEAKER_17]: But as part of public health, we do emergency preparedness planning all the time, too.

1281
01:47:41,721 --> 01:47:46,503
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's been able to be part of my job, as well as working with MIMR.

1282
01:47:48,016 --> 01:47:50,677
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm part of the Emergency Management Director Group with MIMR.

1283
01:47:50,958 --> 01:47:56,060
[SPEAKER_17]: So I've been keeping up with them and trying to get a local committee together because it's not just a one-man job.

1284
01:47:56,300 --> 01:48:02,884
[SPEAKER_17]: Emergency preparedness is really a huge job that requires multidisciplinary teams, so that's what we're trying to develop.

1285
01:48:02,924 --> 01:48:07,266
[SPEAKER_17]: But I will be working to get a team together again to look at this plan.

1286
01:48:07,286 --> 01:48:14,990
[SPEAKER_17]: I already talked with the energy and environmental folks, and we're going to be getting a local committee back together again to really revisit this plan and see what we can get done.

1287
01:48:17,878 --> 01:48:20,279
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, committee for emergency preparedness.

1288
01:48:20,339 --> 01:48:20,999
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just yourself.

1289
01:48:21,859 --> 01:48:22,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, correct.

1290
01:48:22,739 --> 01:48:22,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

1291
01:48:23,079 --> 01:48:23,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1292
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:25,300
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the past there was a committee.

1293
01:48:25,660 --> 01:48:26,400
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not aware of that.

1294
01:48:26,460 --> 01:48:26,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it?

1295
01:48:26,940 --> 01:48:41,244
[SPEAKER_17]: I, I, I believe that they should have been if there wasn't, but yeah, usually it's your public safety folks, you know, um, public health building, uh, mostly community development people who would be involved in the city.

1296
01:48:41,464 --> 01:48:41,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1297
01:48:42,724 --> 01:48:44,385
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to thank you both for your time and effort.

1298
01:48:44,405 --> 01:48:45,845
[SPEAKER_09]: This was a very lengthy and thorough,

1299
01:48:46,556 --> 01:48:47,777
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, report put together.

1300
01:48:48,437 --> 01:48:51,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and, uh, I think it does benefit the community.

1301
01:48:51,879 --> 01:48:52,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1302
01:48:52,280 --> 01:48:52,600
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1303
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:53,541
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam director.

1304
01:48:53,601 --> 01:49:03,267
[SPEAKER_13]: If I could ask a question as, as a reviewing the report, um, um, Mr. Mangoni is still listed as the person on the, if we, if we could take his name off.

1305
01:49:03,327 --> 01:49:08,250
[SPEAKER_13]: So if somebody wants to contact somebody and replace it with the proper person would be, would be appreciated.

1306
01:49:08,270 --> 01:49:09,751
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll have to update that whole committee.

1307
01:49:09,831 --> 01:49:13,493
[SPEAKER_13]: If you can do that before you publish it to the webpage, it'd be appreciated.

1308
01:49:14,414 --> 01:49:14,994
[SPEAKER_13]: Counselor Falco.

1309
01:49:15,496 --> 01:49:16,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1310
01:49:16,297 --> 01:49:17,918
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a couple of quick additional questions.

1311
01:49:19,700 --> 01:49:23,123
[SPEAKER_03]: So you had mentioned about this being a full-time position.

1312
01:49:23,143 --> 01:49:25,785
[SPEAKER_03]: There's enough work to make it a full-time position?

1313
01:49:26,606 --> 01:49:31,590
[SPEAKER_17]: You could spend — emergency preparedness, you could really spend a lot of time getting that.

1314
01:49:31,610 --> 01:49:38,016
[SPEAKER_03]: So in your experience throughout the years, I mean, do you see other cities and towns that actually have a full-time person?

1315
01:49:38,036 --> 01:49:38,696
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just curious.

1316
01:49:38,736 --> 01:49:40,498
[SPEAKER_17]: There are a few that have full-time.

1317
01:49:40,758 --> 01:49:42,940
[SPEAKER_17]: A lot of them have part-time, but certainly there are —

1318
01:49:43,410 --> 01:49:46,132
[SPEAKER_17]: There are communities with full-time emergency management directors.

1319
01:49:47,473 --> 01:49:52,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they more or less communities that maybe live closer to the coast or that are closer to the coast, I guess, or is it just in general?

1320
01:49:53,017 --> 01:49:56,780
[SPEAKER_17]: It just varies, not based on location.

1321
01:49:57,561 --> 01:49:58,261
[SPEAKER_17]: It's usually size.

1322
01:49:58,742 --> 01:49:59,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Size, okay.

1323
01:49:59,382 --> 01:49:59,943
[SPEAKER_03]: That makes sense.

1324
01:50:00,563 --> 01:50:07,348
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as you had mentioned about putting a committee together, that committee's not together yet?

1325
01:50:07,769 --> 01:50:08,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Not yet.

1326
01:50:08,309 --> 01:50:08,970
[SPEAKER_17]: We're working on it.

1327
01:50:09,010 --> 01:50:12,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know when that will be, when the goal is to actually have that committee get together and meet?

1328
01:50:13,857 --> 01:50:16,819
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd like to try to get a meeting together in June and then set quality meetings.

1329
01:50:17,079 --> 01:50:17,599
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, great.

1330
01:50:18,099 --> 01:50:18,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

1331
01:50:18,500 --> 01:50:19,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1332
01:50:20,681 --> 01:50:21,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1333
01:50:21,521 --> 01:50:22,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

1334
01:50:22,182 --> 01:50:28,405
[SPEAKER_20]: Name and address of the record, please.

1335
01:50:29,366 --> 01:50:30,406
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1336
01:50:30,746 --> 01:50:32,728
[SPEAKER_20]: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans street.

1337
01:50:33,368 --> 01:50:40,612
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, before they leave, if I could ask them some questions, uh, through the chair, having not, having not read, uh,

1338
01:50:41,089 --> 01:50:42,870
[SPEAKER_20]: this report yet, and I intend to.

1339
01:50:42,910 --> 01:50:43,991
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm a little bit in the dark.

1340
01:50:44,751 --> 01:50:49,454
[SPEAKER_20]: My question pertains to the funding grants that are possible.

1341
01:50:50,314 --> 01:51:01,881
[SPEAKER_20]: From what I'm hearing tonight, this sounds like it's expressly for some kind of natural disaster where health concerns are.

1342
01:51:02,401 --> 01:51:09,845
[SPEAKER_20]: But through the funding that we're now available for, what kind of grants could the City of Medford apply for?

1343
01:51:10,329 --> 01:51:15,930
[SPEAKER_20]: such as a few weeks ago Councillor Knight brought up the epi pens for first responders.

1344
01:51:16,211 --> 01:51:17,291
[SPEAKER_20]: Could we get funding for that?

1345
01:51:18,051 --> 01:51:21,292
[SPEAKER_20]: These have been for natural disasters.

1346
01:51:21,872 --> 01:51:23,832
[SPEAKER_20]: Specifically just for natural disasters?

1347
01:51:24,493 --> 01:51:24,593
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1348
01:51:25,453 --> 01:51:27,813
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, then I guess that answers all my questions.

1349
01:51:27,853 --> 01:51:28,794
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't have to address them.

1350
01:51:29,034 --> 01:51:30,614
[SPEAKER_20]: But one last question to the city.

1351
01:51:30,654 --> 01:51:33,815
[SPEAKER_20]: I know Councillor Brianna Lungo‑Kern has brought up often

1352
01:51:34,463 --> 01:51:36,644
[SPEAKER_20]: uh, hiring a full-time grant writer.

1353
01:51:36,844 --> 01:51:38,444
[SPEAKER_20]: Has the city of Medford done that yet?

1354
01:51:38,625 --> 01:51:39,285
[SPEAKER_20]: Not to my knowledge.

1355
01:51:39,565 --> 01:51:39,825
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1356
01:51:40,045 --> 01:51:40,825
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1357
01:51:40,845 --> 01:51:41,125
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1358
01:51:44,727 --> 01:51:45,867
[SPEAKER_25]: Name and address for the record, please.

1359
01:51:46,547 --> 01:51:46,847
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1360
01:51:46,887 --> 01:51:50,689
[SPEAKER_25]: Council President Andrew cast and Eddie Cushion street method mass.

1361
01:51:51,109 --> 01:51:59,532
[SPEAKER_25]: Um, to the chair, I would like to ask the, uh, to the chair, to the chair, ask the director of the board of health.

1362
01:51:59,852 --> 01:52:02,633
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm sorry, the director of environmental planning.

1363
01:52:03,237 --> 01:52:05,299
[SPEAKER_25]: or the Metropolitan Area Council.

1364
01:52:07,681 --> 01:52:20,172
[SPEAKER_25]: I've been hearing some words about flooding and national disasters and things of that nature, and with the melt and ice caps, so they say.

1365
01:52:20,192 --> 01:52:22,333
[SPEAKER_25]: I have two simple questions.

1366
01:52:22,754 --> 01:52:25,756
[SPEAKER_25]: I would like two simple, concrete answers.

1367
01:52:26,917 --> 01:52:28,619
[SPEAKER_25]: Through the chair, for the director,

1368
01:52:30,253 --> 01:52:33,156
[SPEAKER_25]: How many feet above sea level is the Karatek Bridge?

1369
01:52:34,837 --> 01:52:41,984
[SPEAKER_25]: And the second question, how many feet above sea level is the Emilia Earhart Dam at the Tipiti Top?

1370
01:52:42,645 --> 01:52:43,626
[SPEAKER_25]: Two simple questions.

1371
01:52:44,606 --> 01:52:46,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Were you able to answer that question, sir?

1372
01:52:48,250 --> 01:52:50,932
[SPEAKER_13]: If the ASTAPs do come up?

1373
01:52:51,173 --> 01:52:54,035
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I don't know the details of the sea level rise.

1374
01:52:55,395 --> 01:52:59,018
[SPEAKER_24]: Elevation, I mean that's information we could access very quickly, but on the top of my head.

1375
01:52:59,058 --> 01:52:59,959
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know the answer to that.

1376
01:53:00,380 --> 01:53:18,396
[SPEAKER_25]: I thank you sir Thank you on the motion by councillor nice that this paper be adopted Second and by councillor Falco, mr. Clerk, please call the roll

01:54:20,982 --> 01:54:21,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Longo Kern.

1397
01:54:24,355 --> 01:54:29,158
[SPEAKER_13]: If you'd like to combine 448 and 445, Mr. Clerk.

1398
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:41,725
[SPEAKER_13]: 17, 445 offered by Vice President Mox, be it resolved that the subdivision plan for Macklin Road in the site plan review for 252 Main Street be discussed.

1399
01:54:42,366 --> 01:54:43,266
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Longo Kern.

1400
01:54:43,707 --> 01:54:45,648
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1401
01:54:45,968 --> 01:54:52,492
[SPEAKER_23]: I put this on last week after a few concerned residents had filled me in

1402
01:54:53,016 --> 01:54:54,917
[SPEAKER_23]: and what was going on down at Macklin Road.

1403
01:54:55,017 --> 01:55:12,490
[SPEAKER_23]: It looks like there's a potential subdivision that was put forth for the Office of Community Development site plan review last Wednesday and is before, I believe, the Conservation Commission within the next couple days, tomorrow.

1404
01:55:13,451 --> 01:55:16,293
[SPEAKER_23]: Tomorrow, in front of the Conservation Commission.

1405
01:55:18,074 --> 01:55:19,916
[SPEAKER_23]: Right, 6.30 tomorrow.

1406
01:55:22,380 --> 01:55:26,362
[SPEAKER_23]: My concern, obviously, we've been involved in a number of different developments.

1407
01:55:26,382 --> 01:55:27,362
[SPEAKER_23]: We've had a lot going on.

1408
01:55:27,422 --> 01:55:36,866
[SPEAKER_23]: A bunch of us have tried to go to a number of meetings, whether it be ZBA or OCD, Office of Community Development, private meetings.

1409
01:55:36,926 --> 01:55:47,750
[SPEAKER_23]: This one I wasn't able to attend last Wednesday, but I do know that the residents have extreme concerns with regards to this being close to a conservation buffer.

1410
01:55:48,338 --> 01:55:50,458
[SPEAKER_23]: as well as potential flooding in the area.

1411
01:55:50,598 --> 01:56:00,661
[SPEAKER_23]: I know this abuts McCormick Ave, and there are residents on McCormick Ave that are very concerned that they're gonna experience additional flooding on their road.

1412
01:56:01,861 --> 01:56:10,062
[SPEAKER_23]: So if we could just get an update from the Conservation Commission with any potential concerns they have.

1413
01:56:10,182 --> 01:56:17,484
[SPEAKER_23]: I know they're gonna meet tomorrow night, but hopefully not only get an update from them, but let them know that the Metro City Council, if we could amend the paper,

1414
01:56:18,129 --> 01:56:27,135
[SPEAKER_23]: is very concerned, is interested in the residents concerns with regards to the flooding and the conservation buffer zone.

1415
01:56:27,195 --> 01:56:40,224
[SPEAKER_23]: So if we could let them know we are concerned and get an update with regards to what needs to be done, if this is a project that can go forward, cannot go forward, why not?

1416
01:56:40,244 --> 01:56:45,328
[SPEAKER_23]: I believe it's three homes that are gonna create a potential cul-de-sac in the area.

1417
01:56:45,916 --> 01:56:47,656
[SPEAKER_23]: And I do have, I mean, I live up in the Heights.

1418
01:56:47,736 --> 01:56:53,638
[SPEAKER_23]: I am concerned for my neighbors with regards to, um, any, nobody wants any flooding in their home.

1419
01:56:53,678 --> 01:56:59,379
[SPEAKER_23]: And if this is going to create that, we want to make sure we either do it in the right way or prevent it from happening.

1420
01:56:59,479 --> 01:57:04,020
[SPEAKER_23]: So if we could get some answers, that would be beneficial to the area.

1421
01:57:04,381 --> 01:57:04,721
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1422
01:57:05,961 --> 01:57:06,341
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1423
01:57:06,441 --> 01:57:08,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Counsel Longo, current counselor marks.

1424
01:57:10,822 --> 01:57:11,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, thank you, Mr. President.

1425
01:57:12,122 --> 01:57:14,103
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, I had the opportunity to attend the meeting,

1426
01:57:14,834 --> 01:57:16,935
[SPEAKER_09]: last Wednesday before the Community Development Board.

1427
01:57:17,796 --> 01:57:28,442
[SPEAKER_09]: And on Macklin Road, there were a number of residents, as Councilor Langel-Kern mentioned, the proposal is to build three new homes on an area that abuts wetlands.

1428
01:57:29,322 --> 01:57:40,128
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess the Conservation Commission tomorrow night will be addressing whether or not the particular wetlands up there are active wetlands.

1429
01:57:40,889 --> 01:57:43,370
[SPEAKER_09]: And that determination, I guess, will have a big impact

1430
01:57:43,777 --> 01:57:46,419
[SPEAKER_09]: whether or not this, uh, project moves forward.

1431
01:57:46,919 --> 01:58:00,710
[SPEAKER_09]: But the neighborhood, uh, Mr. President, as Councilor Longo Kern mentioned, uh, the project itself, uh, is in an area that is nestled between, uh, protected wetlands and homes, uh, towards the back.

1432
01:58:01,450 --> 01:58:05,433
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, the proposed homes are elevated higher than the homes behind them.

1433
01:58:05,914 --> 01:58:08,936
[SPEAKER_09]: So the, uh, residents were concerned that there would be,

1434
01:58:09,346 --> 01:58:24,692
[SPEAKER_09]: a fair amount of runoff water into their yard in an area that I mentioned earlier when we were talking about the hazard mitigation plan, that there are residents up there that have sump pumps that run 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

1435
01:58:25,032 --> 01:58:26,073
[SPEAKER_09]: They never shut off.

1436
01:58:26,473 --> 01:58:29,334
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how much groundwater is in that particular area.

1437
01:58:29,834 --> 01:58:37,097
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's the fact that there's poor drainage, Mr. President, but there's also the Cranberry Brook up there.

1438
01:58:37,541 --> 01:58:51,307
[SPEAKER_09]: which is an open brook that's been up there for many, many years, and I guess takes runoff water from a lot of the surrounding area and possibly even some of the local rivers, Mr. President.

1439
01:58:51,947 --> 01:58:55,368
[SPEAKER_09]: A second concern was regarding water pressure.

1440
01:58:56,089 --> 01:59:04,692
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've been on this council a number of years, and I can tell you firsthand that when you hear water pressure, it's synonymous with North Meffitt and the Heights.

1441
01:59:05,633 --> 01:59:06,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Poor water pressure.

1442
01:59:07,066 --> 01:59:09,248
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, someone next door is washing their car.

1443
01:59:09,648 --> 01:59:10,949
[SPEAKER_09]: The gentleman can't take a shower.

1444
01:59:11,309 --> 01:59:15,012
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how poor the pressure is, Mr. President, in that particular area.

1445
01:59:15,032 --> 01:59:22,017
[SPEAKER_09]: So residents, although it's only three homes, have the right to request and say, what's going to happen with our water pressure?

1446
01:59:22,297 --> 01:59:23,938
[SPEAKER_09]: It's already low as is.

1447
01:59:24,378 --> 01:59:27,661
[SPEAKER_09]: What is going to be the case with new development in the area?

1448
01:59:28,602 --> 01:59:30,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Some several years back, we put a new pump

1449
01:59:30,950 --> 01:59:44,935
[SPEAKER_09]: to improve pressure at the bottom of Fulton Street, and that has done some help in providing additional water pressure, but towards the top of the heights, I don't think it's alleviated any concerns that residents have.

1450
01:59:45,635 --> 01:59:54,878
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, based on the plane of these homes, they're gonna have to have a pump that pumps their sewage from the house to the city of Meffitt sewer line.

1451
01:59:55,398 --> 02:00:00,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Because of the angle, it doesn't flow as it should flow,

1452
02:00:00,968 --> 02:00:10,474
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're going to create these storage containers under the ground, giant sewage storage containers for these three homes.

1453
02:00:11,094 --> 02:00:21,100
[SPEAKER_09]: They're made out of cement and they work like, you know, if sewage is going into them, there's a pump that sends it back out to the sewage pipe.

1454
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:26,844
[SPEAKER_09]: However, because of power outages, they're equipped only to handle up to 24 hours.

1455
02:00:28,092 --> 02:00:31,634
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you happen to have a power outage, Mr. President, that's over 24 hours.

1456
02:00:32,315 --> 02:00:32,975
[SPEAKER_09]: And that happens.

1457
02:00:33,215 --> 02:00:36,217
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it happens quite frequently in areas of our community.

1458
02:00:36,898 --> 02:00:41,821
[SPEAKER_09]: These sewage container systems aren't equipped to accommodate the sewage that's going to be going into them.

1459
02:00:42,481 --> 02:00:45,043
[SPEAKER_09]: And that poses another concern that residents had.

1460
02:00:45,403 --> 02:00:46,284
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, how will it back up?

1461
02:00:46,304 --> 02:00:52,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Will it back up into the new homes, or will it end up going up the pipe and possibly backing into our homes?

1462
02:00:52,628 --> 02:00:56,430
[SPEAKER_09]: And that was another question that was asked regarding the sewage.

1463
02:00:58,183 --> 02:00:59,203
[SPEAKER_09]: The snow removal.

1464
02:00:59,544 --> 02:01:00,644
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a private road.

1465
02:01:01,244 --> 02:01:03,485
[SPEAKER_09]: Who's responsible ultimately for the snow removal?

1466
02:01:04,065 --> 02:01:05,566
[SPEAKER_09]: And where is the snow going to be put?

1467
02:01:05,946 --> 02:01:07,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it going to be put back on a city street?

1468
02:01:07,986 --> 02:01:09,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it going to be put towards wetlands?

1469
02:01:09,587 --> 02:01:15,349
[SPEAKER_09]: And as we all know, you can't put snow because of salt and other debris near any type of wetlands.

1470
02:01:16,329 --> 02:01:17,710
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a concern, Mr. President.

1471
02:01:18,350 --> 02:01:20,031
[SPEAKER_09]: And the ownership of the water pipes.

1472
02:01:20,831 --> 02:01:26,253
[SPEAKER_09]: Where this is a private road, I believe the developer is responsible for the ownership of the water pipes.

1473
02:01:26,845 --> 02:01:31,749
[SPEAKER_09]: But those pipes are going to lead 100, 150 feet, 200 feet.

1474
02:01:32,790 --> 02:01:36,012
[SPEAKER_09]: And if one breaks during the night, who's responsible?

1475
02:01:36,312 --> 02:01:37,653
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not the city's water pipes.

1476
02:01:38,294 --> 02:01:39,875
[SPEAKER_09]: It's leading to the city's water pipes.

1477
02:01:40,736 --> 02:01:44,538
[SPEAKER_09]: So there are a number of questions that need to be answered, Mr. President.

1478
02:01:45,119 --> 02:01:47,160
[SPEAKER_09]: And just so you know, these are three lots.

1479
02:01:47,621 --> 02:01:53,525
[SPEAKER_09]: There's also another, from what I understand, 14 other non-buildable lots as it stands right now.

1480
02:01:53,906 --> 02:01:54,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Some are undersized.

1481
02:01:56,266 --> 02:02:01,130
[SPEAKER_09]: and that will be the next step, I can almost guarantee ya, if these homes go in.

1482
02:02:01,850 --> 02:02:04,592
[SPEAKER_09]: The second point I wanted to bring up was 252 Main Street.

1483
02:02:05,313 --> 02:02:06,794
[SPEAKER_09]: It's currently a multi-family home.

1484
02:02:06,834 --> 02:02:08,835
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it's a two or three family home.

1485
02:02:10,476 --> 02:02:18,382
[SPEAKER_09]: It's right on Main Street, right around the corner from, which street is it?

1486
02:02:19,183 --> 02:02:19,843
[SPEAKER_09]: Hancock Street.

1487
02:02:19,863 --> 02:02:21,364
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, Hancock Street, correct, thank you.

1488
02:02:22,365 --> 02:02:24,987
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're taking a two or three family home

1489
02:02:25,588 --> 02:02:36,176
[SPEAKER_09]: and they're trying to create nine units, like they did a couple doors down in that blue monstrosity that I refer to it as, that doesn't fit into the neighborhood.

1490
02:02:36,617 --> 02:02:52,629
[SPEAKER_09]: It just so happens they're gonna be looking for a variance, because they're three spots shy of the variance for parking, and as we know, that's already a congested area, it's already on Main Street where you can't park, and what will be happening, even though they're saying

1491
02:02:53,207 --> 02:02:56,549
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all you hear now at these meetings, the millennials are moving in there.

1492
02:02:56,910 --> 02:02:59,632
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like Paul Revere, the millennials are coming, the millennials are coming.

1493
02:03:00,232 --> 02:03:03,314
[SPEAKER_09]: And oh, they won't have cars, they'll never have families, they'll never have kids.

1494
02:03:04,095 --> 02:03:06,556
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how you can state that, Mr. President.

1495
02:03:06,917 --> 02:03:12,180
[SPEAKER_09]: It sounds good when you make a presentation, I guess, to get what you want, but it's not reality.

1496
02:03:12,801 --> 02:03:21,667
[SPEAKER_09]: And in my opinion, if you don't conform to current ordinances right now, in particular parking and height restrictions, which seem to be the major catching point,

1497
02:03:22,104 --> 02:03:23,686
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think your project should move forward.

1498
02:03:24,127 --> 02:03:27,351
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the way I feel about 252 High Street, Mr. President.

1499
02:03:28,552 --> 02:03:33,499
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I'm looking forward to see what happens with both of these projects.

1500
02:03:34,099 --> 02:03:40,668
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hope that the neighborhood on both Macklin and 252 Main Street in South Bedford

1501
02:03:41,185 --> 02:03:42,146
[SPEAKER_09]: are looped into this.

1502
02:03:42,646 --> 02:03:46,509
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's plenty of neighborhood, um, input and feedback, Mr. President.

1503
02:03:46,669 --> 02:03:48,490
[SPEAKER_13]: And what day is this meeting, Mr. Vice President?

1504
02:03:48,590 --> 02:03:49,571
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it's tomorrow.

1505
02:03:49,611 --> 02:03:53,513
[SPEAKER_09]: The conservation commission meeting at six 30, six 30, I believe tomorrow.

1506
02:03:54,113 --> 02:04:01,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and they're going to talk about at least Macklin on the, um, the wetlands up there and whether they're active or slightly active.

1507
02:04:01,718 --> 02:04:05,361
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't, I don't know the exact terminology, but that's what they get to decide.

1508
02:04:05,381 --> 02:04:05,941
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

1509
02:04:06,201 --> 02:04:06,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1510
02:04:08,043 --> 02:04:08,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

1511
02:04:09,081 --> 02:04:09,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you Mr. President.

1512
02:04:09,901 --> 02:04:13,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank my council colleagues for bringing these resolutions forward tonight.

1513
02:04:13,703 --> 02:04:30,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been called a number of times with regard to the Macklin road development and um, I had the opportunity to, uh, to attend the, uh, the conservation commission meeting along with you actually on April 19th and uh, it was at the community development board meeting last week with council of marks.

1514
02:04:30,769 --> 02:04:31,769
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to leave a little bit early.

1515
02:04:31,789 --> 02:04:33,990
[SPEAKER_03]: My son had a band concert, but um,

1516
02:04:34,987 --> 02:04:46,851
[SPEAKER_03]: the residents in this neighborhood, uh, up in the Macklin road area have really rallied behind this to, uh, see what they can do, um, to, to, you know, hopefully prevent or at least make this small than it is.

1517
02:04:46,911 --> 02:04:54,934
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my colleagues mentioned tonight, there are a lot of concerns with regard to, uh, what putting in three new homes you're going to bring to this neighborhood.

1518
02:04:55,674 --> 02:05:03,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you go down McCormick gap, you drive down McCormick gap tonight, you will see hoses coming out of the basements of these homes and they are constantly pumping water out.

1519
02:05:04,330 --> 02:05:08,131
[SPEAKER_03]: The sub pumps are going nonstop, and no one should have to live like this.

1520
02:05:08,432 --> 02:05:13,734
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think by putting in three new homes, it's completely going to exasperate the situation.

1521
02:05:14,194 --> 02:05:25,218
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that we really have to take the city or the Conservation Commission and the Community Development Board really have to take this under consideration when looking at a development like this.

1522
02:05:27,139 --> 02:05:29,539
[SPEAKER_03]: So major flooding is a concern.

1523
02:05:31,478 --> 02:05:35,639
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think disrupting the ground in that area, I mean, you know, you're near a brook.

1524
02:05:35,659 --> 02:05:37,639
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's completely unknown what's going to happen.

1525
02:05:37,679 --> 02:05:39,320
[SPEAKER_03]: The water has to flow somewhere.

1526
02:05:39,780 --> 02:05:41,120
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is a concern as well.

1527
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:50,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, uh, council marks mentioned that water pressure in that area, a lot of friends that live up there in, you know, water pressure is tough, tough on that street in particular.

1528
02:05:50,682 --> 02:05:57,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, someone called me and said, you know, I can't, you know, take a shower and have someone flush the toilet at the same time or else there's the water

1529
02:05:57,644 --> 02:05:58,924
[SPEAKER_03]: completely shuts down almost.

1530
02:05:58,964 --> 02:06:00,465
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, that's a concern.

1531
02:06:00,485 --> 02:06:12,989
[SPEAKER_03]: You go to, to environmental issues, you take a look, this developer has already cut down one tree within the buffer zone and that's completely, completely a blatant disrespect to, to our ordinances.

1532
02:06:13,129 --> 02:06:14,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's completely wrong.

1533
02:06:14,809 --> 02:06:23,732
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, I, I mean, I think, you know, when, when they're cutting down trees in a buffer zone, you know, right away that should set up, uh, send up red flags, uh, you know,

1534
02:06:24,273 --> 02:06:29,056
[SPEAKER_03]: that, you know, like my colleagues mentioned, they're proposing three homes on this cul-de-sac.

1535
02:06:30,197 --> 02:06:32,899
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in one of the homes is within the wetlands buffer zone.

1536
02:06:33,840 --> 02:06:40,104
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we have to be really careful here as a city, because if you're going to allow something like this, you're setting precedent for future development.

1537
02:06:40,565 --> 02:06:44,968
[SPEAKER_03]: You're setting precedent for, you know, other homes in other wetland type areas.

1538
02:06:45,148 --> 02:06:46,209
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to watch out there.

1539
02:06:47,049 --> 02:06:48,330
[SPEAKER_03]: It's completely wrong.

1540
02:06:48,370 --> 02:06:52,273
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, you know, you know, kudos to the, to the citizens really for stepping up

1541
02:06:53,110 --> 02:06:58,614
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there was probably 60 to 70, 75 people at the Conservation Commission meeting.

1542
02:06:59,294 --> 02:07:01,055
[SPEAKER_03]: There were a lot of residents here last week.

1543
02:07:01,075 --> 02:07:05,558
[SPEAKER_03]: And I give them a lot of credit because both of those meetings have been continued.

1544
02:07:05,638 --> 02:07:08,120
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's meeting after meeting, week after week.

1545
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:13,603
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really applaud your tenacity of going after this and staying on top of it.

1546
02:07:13,904 --> 02:07:15,044
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's important.

1547
02:07:16,265 --> 02:07:19,007
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really, there's a lot of concerns.

1548
02:07:21,479 --> 02:07:23,200
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think out of the box here a little bit.

1549
02:07:24,120 --> 02:07:28,142
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned Council Marks, how there's 14 other lots that are unbuildable.

1550
02:07:29,203 --> 02:07:32,825
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone's trying to come here and build.

1551
02:07:32,905 --> 02:07:39,568
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, we take a look at the CPA and how we passed that, the community passed that last year.

1552
02:07:39,608 --> 02:07:49,453
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something, I know the CPA here is in its infancy, but this is something that really, you talk about open space and stuff like that, this is something that probably could

1553
02:07:50,213 --> 02:08:00,658
[SPEAKER_03]: be considered, you know, that the city could maybe purchase at some point in time, and I'm not saying, you know, one of the first projects, but maybe down the line they could, you know, purchase this in a place of conservation, restriction on the property.

1554
02:08:01,038 --> 02:08:02,859
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, you can't build on it in the future.

1555
02:08:03,259 --> 02:08:05,480
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's, you know, these are things that we need to look at.

1556
02:08:06,281 --> 02:08:19,267
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I did promise a resident tonight, it's really been on top of the situation since, you know, there's a resident up on McCormick Ave, Will Humphreys, a nice guy, and he's been on top of this

1557
02:08:20,238 --> 02:08:22,259
[SPEAKER_03]: This came about, this whole issue.

1558
02:08:22,739 --> 02:08:24,700
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, you know, he couldn't make it to the meeting tonight.

1559
02:08:25,300 --> 02:08:29,181
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, I mean, these residents had been going to meetings nonstop.

1560
02:08:29,781 --> 02:08:31,182
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, can you please read a letter for me?

1561
02:08:31,202 --> 02:08:32,202
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, absolutely.

1562
02:08:32,242 --> 02:08:38,805
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, I mean, if he's going to be here tomorrow night, then he's going to be at a meeting next week, whenever the Conservation Commission meets.

1563
02:08:39,265 --> 02:08:40,525
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I said, no problem.

1564
02:08:40,545 --> 02:08:41,466
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll read the letter for you.

1565
02:08:41,526 --> 02:08:43,806
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll submit this into the public record.

1566
02:08:43,826 --> 02:08:46,867
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll make a copy for you, Mr. Finn.

1567
02:08:47,268 --> 02:08:48,188
[SPEAKER_03]: To whom it may concern.

1568
02:08:49,361 --> 02:08:55,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm ready to ask method elected representatives, uh, commissions and boards to listen to its citizens when considering this development.

1569
02:08:55,967 --> 02:09:07,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to the environment, uh, environment department and conservation commission in the community development office and board, uh, the city engineer, the city council, and the ongoing attention to the many problems with this subdivision proposal.

1570
02:09:08,137 --> 02:09:12,481
[SPEAKER_03]: The community surrounds this develop the community that surrounds this development is speaking out

1571
02:09:12,885 --> 02:09:16,027
[SPEAKER_03]: with a unified voice of concern and opposition.

1572
02:09:16,707 --> 02:09:19,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Many citizens attended meetings on the proposal.

1573
02:09:20,029 --> 02:09:42,360
[SPEAKER_03]: Concerns expressed include loss of storm and flood water retention capacity, increased throughput to sewer and water systems that are already strained, damage to existing homes and extensive blasting of ledge, loss of aesthetically pleasing natural green space, wildlife habitat destruction and damage to wetlands,

1574
02:09:43,230 --> 02:09:45,651
[SPEAKER_03]: increased traffic near Carr Park and the Tot Lot.

1575
02:09:46,552 --> 02:09:58,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Access issues and disturbance to Direct the Butter on Macklin Road were a non-profit organization that provides services to several long-time residents with developmental disabilities at the home.

1576
02:10:00,039 --> 02:10:09,103
[SPEAKER_03]: He also goes on to say that he included a petition of 115 Medford residents, representing much of the surrounding neighborhood, echoing these same concerns.

1577
02:10:11,272 --> 02:10:13,894
[SPEAKER_03]: in its current state is of great value to the community.

1578
02:10:14,454 --> 02:10:19,978
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the opposite of an abandoned building in need of improvement or environmental cleanup.

1579
02:10:20,418 --> 02:10:23,401
[SPEAKER_03]: The surrounding neighborhood is unified in opposition to the proposal.

1580
02:10:23,861 --> 02:10:27,303
[SPEAKER_03]: No public benefit is served through development of the subdivision.

1581
02:10:27,924 --> 02:10:35,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford's assessors has long considered 13 of the 14 lots as undevelopable when assessing their value.

1582
02:10:36,225 --> 02:10:45,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Therefore, the city should not grant any waivers or variances to existing regulations around roadways, setbacks, zoning, and building codes, or environmental protections.

1583
02:10:46,047 --> 02:10:50,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Those regulations exist to protect our city, its citizens, and its ecosystems.

1584
02:10:51,368 --> 02:10:55,208
[SPEAKER_03]: If the regulations can't be adhered to, then the land should not be developed upon.

1585
02:10:55,268 --> 02:10:56,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Sincerely, Will Humphreys.

1586
02:10:57,169 --> 02:10:58,749
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to read that on his behalf.

1587
02:10:58,949 --> 02:11:01,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I will print out a copy of that letter.

1588
02:11:01,590 --> 02:11:03,370
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think, you know, one of the,

1589
02:11:04,358 --> 02:11:10,223
[SPEAKER_03]: things just to conclude on is that, you know, this is a unique piece of land in our community.

1590
02:11:10,243 --> 02:11:18,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, it's, it's one of the few remaining areas within the city of Medford that has, you know, Woodland habitat in, you know, we really need to preserve this.

1591
02:11:18,891 --> 02:11:22,954
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just wanted to go on the record and saying that I thank my colleagues for bringing this up for tonight.

1592
02:11:23,155 --> 02:11:23,475
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1593
02:11:23,495 --> 02:11:23,775
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1594
02:11:23,795 --> 02:11:24,456
[SPEAKER_13]: Counselor Falco.

1595
02:11:26,698 --> 02:11:27,779
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

1596
02:11:27,819 --> 02:11:31,302
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Ann Caltrera and my address is 17 McCormick Gav.

1597
02:11:32,297 --> 02:11:34,859
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm here to speak against the development.

1598
02:11:35,119 --> 02:11:37,780
[SPEAKER_00]: I directly abut the property being developed.

1599
02:11:38,621 --> 02:11:40,882
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've lived there for over 20 years.

1600
02:11:41,002 --> 02:11:46,005
[SPEAKER_00]: My husband has lived there and his family on that street since the 1950s.

1601
02:11:46,886 --> 02:11:55,751
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, as has been stated, have had lots of problems with water pressure, with flooding.

1602
02:11:57,773 --> 02:12:01,535
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are concerned that this is going to add to that.

1603
02:12:01,975 --> 02:12:02,836
[SPEAKER_00]: to those problems.

1604
02:12:04,677 --> 02:12:05,858
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a big concern.

1605
02:12:06,318 --> 02:12:09,941
[SPEAKER_00]: We also feel that it's detrimental to the neighborhood.

1606
02:12:09,961 --> 02:12:14,385
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have moved into the neighborhood because we have some green space.

1607
02:12:15,185 --> 02:12:16,767
[SPEAKER_00]: There isn't much in Medford.

1608
02:12:17,527 --> 02:12:30,918
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also concerned about added traffic to the area because it's a very tight, where Winslow goes into Tamor, you know, it cuts off and there's a lot of kids coming that way.

1609
02:12:31,462 --> 02:12:36,906
[SPEAKER_00]: on bicycles going to car park and so forth, and the group home on the corner.

1610
02:12:37,566 --> 02:12:42,229
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we feel that this is a dead end road.

1611
02:12:43,771 --> 02:12:53,617
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, people on Tamor have also expressed that the wetland, they're concerned that it's going to exasperate the problems they have with wetlands behind them as well.

1612
02:12:54,678 --> 02:13:00,422
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the concern that one wetland sort of feeds into another, and as has been said,

1613
02:13:01,432 --> 02:13:02,552
[SPEAKER_00]: the water has to go somewhere.

1614
02:13:03,292 --> 02:13:08,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so we're, we're glad that you're, uh, reviewing this proposal.

1615
02:13:08,274 --> 02:13:17,996
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the neighborhood has been very united, uh, against this development and we hope that it does not go forward.

1616
02:13:18,016 --> 02:13:18,996
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.

1617
02:13:19,356 --> 02:13:19,596
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1618
02:13:19,636 --> 02:13:20,197
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Coltrane.

1619
02:13:20,217 --> 02:13:24,498
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address of the record, please.

1620
02:13:25,078 --> 02:13:28,679
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Jen Young and I live at 72 McCormick Ave in Medford.

1621
02:13:29,339 --> 02:13:29,739
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um,

1622
02:13:31,252 --> 02:13:36,234
[SPEAKER_12]: My husband and I actually bought our home from the Coltreras 13 years ago.

1623
02:13:36,834 --> 02:13:39,115
[SPEAKER_12]: And we live just down the street from them now.

1624
02:13:39,775 --> 02:13:46,397
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of the reasons that we chose to move to Medford and to this area of Medford was because of that green space.

1625
02:13:46,517 --> 02:13:57,801
[SPEAKER_12]: We decided when we saw the house on a dead end street, and we could imagine our kids riding their bikes down the street, which they do now, and then that we can see trees and we can see green space.

1626
02:13:57,961 --> 02:14:00,602
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think one of the things that

1627
02:14:01,190 --> 02:14:16,696
[SPEAKER_12]: surprised us when we moved in was in the late winter seeing this sort of path going through our backyard across the street into this area that we're talking about, which has become a real kind of wildlife sort of pathway coming from the fells.

1628
02:14:17,317 --> 02:14:25,540
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think kind of building in that area, or even next to that area, really limits the wildlife area in Medford.

1629
02:14:25,700 --> 02:14:29,822
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's really important to keep the green space that we do have.

1630
02:14:30,542 --> 02:14:30,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

1631
02:14:31,380 --> 02:14:31,760
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1632
02:14:34,381 --> 02:14:38,263
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Kern, seconded by Vice President Mox.

1633
02:14:41,885 --> 02:14:42,525
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lungo-Kern.

1634
02:14:42,685 --> 02:14:47,647
[SPEAKER_23]: Through the Chair, thank you, President Carviello, because I couldn't make the Wednesday night meeting.

1635
02:14:47,667 --> 02:14:52,070
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you know what the final, does anybody know what the final vote was for the site plan review?

1636
02:14:55,491 --> 02:14:56,992
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco, if you can.

1637
02:14:57,052 --> 02:14:58,152
[SPEAKER_03]: From what I've been told,

1638
02:15:00,085 --> 02:15:01,806
[SPEAKER_03]: they've been more questions than answers.

1639
02:15:01,886 --> 02:15:05,148
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess the developer has not been really able to answer much.

1640
02:15:05,809 --> 02:15:06,649
[SPEAKER_03]: So no vote was taken.

1641
02:15:06,689 --> 02:15:07,670
[SPEAKER_03]: No vote's been taken.

1642
02:15:08,110 --> 02:15:10,912
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to go in front of the conservation commission again tomorrow night.

1643
02:15:11,092 --> 02:15:16,035
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they're going again, uh, they're going in front of the community development board again.

1644
02:15:16,055 --> 02:15:22,119
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know the date of that meeting, but they've been, uh, there were a ton of questions from both commissions.

1645
02:15:22,660 --> 02:15:26,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and they need to, the developer needs to get back to both boards.

1646
02:15:27,319 --> 02:15:47,508
[SPEAKER_23]: With the answers to those questions, so thank you Thank you and with regards to tomorrow night's meeting, I mean it sounds like they're Update notice of intent regarding the creation of the subdivision on Macklin Road and Medford

1647
02:15:48,047 --> 02:15:51,988
[SPEAKER_23]: with one proposed lot, so does anybody know exactly what tomorrow night will be?

1648
02:15:52,028 --> 02:15:54,009
[SPEAKER_23]: Will it be question and answer?

1649
02:15:54,109 --> 02:15:55,629
[SPEAKER_23]: Will the public be able to speak?

1650
02:15:55,969 --> 02:15:58,650
[SPEAKER_23]: I just don't know if my colleagues know the answer to that either.

1651
02:15:59,350 --> 02:16:01,111
[SPEAKER_13]: I would assume everyone will be able to speak tomorrow evening.

1652
02:16:01,711 --> 02:16:04,792
[SPEAKER_13]: They didn't say that there would be any restrictions.

1653
02:16:09,173 --> 02:16:17,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm under the same pressure that everyone's going to be able to speak, and hopefully the developer will have answers to the questions that the commission

1654
02:16:18,057 --> 02:16:22,018
[SPEAKER_03]: ahead because they had, I think, a laundry list of questions that needed to be answered.

1655
02:16:22,098 --> 02:16:38,263
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe that the Conservation Commission was actually going, they had done one site visit, and I think they were going to do, or at least there was one member that actually wanted to go out and look at the wetlands, I think, to actually physically see the space, so.

1656
02:16:39,283 --> 02:16:39,643
[SPEAKER_23]: Good to know.

1657
02:16:39,703 --> 02:16:39,983
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1658
02:16:40,003 --> 02:16:40,583
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1659
02:16:41,044 --> 02:16:41,784
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Mox.

1660
02:16:47,426 --> 02:16:48,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1661
02:16:48,607 --> 02:16:56,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I believe also last Wednesday there were, uh, many issues as console Falco mentioned that, uh, we're not answered.

1662
02:16:56,794 --> 02:17:09,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Although the city engineer was in attendance and many of them were directed to her, uh, the committee, um, requested that the community development board requested that the city engineer sit down with the developer.

1663
02:17:09,805 --> 02:17:15,170
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think in between these other meetings that are taking place with the conservation committee, uh, commission,

1664
02:17:15,697 --> 02:17:21,920
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, that the city engineer is going to meet to discuss ownership of pipes and other issues that deal with engineering.

1665
02:17:22,320 --> 02:17:23,660
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that's the first point.

1666
02:17:24,221 --> 02:17:26,722
[SPEAKER_09]: The second point, Mr. President is we heard tonight.

1667
02:17:26,742 --> 02:17:42,328
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why I mentioned to, uh, the, uh, board that came before us, um, for emergency preparedness is that, uh, you know, year after year, the city recommends, uh, that we attend to certain areas that are prone to flooding.

1668
02:17:43,012 --> 02:17:45,355
[SPEAKER_09]: And the Heights is listed all the time, Salt Method.

1669
02:17:45,635 --> 02:17:49,320
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a number of hotspots that this community is aware of for years.

1670
02:17:50,115 --> 02:17:58,481
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are steps that we can take for a very minimal amount of money to help alleviate some of the concerns that we're hearing.

1671
02:17:59,361 --> 02:18:07,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Back several years ago, I met with residents on McCormick Ave that were concerned that just a simple issue of how the street is sloped.

1672
02:18:08,207 --> 02:18:17,833
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, people were building up their driveway because the street was sloped so the water wouldn't pour into catch basins, but pour into people's driveways, which eventually ends up in their basement.

1673
02:18:18,600 --> 02:18:28,766
[SPEAKER_09]: And these were simple things that, you know, grinding of a street and repositioning and reangling a street so it pours into a catch basin and not into people's driveways.

1674
02:18:29,286 --> 02:18:38,132
[SPEAKER_09]: But there were people's driveways that were up literally five to six inches above the street because they were so sick of having water pour into their driveway.

1675
02:18:38,832 --> 02:18:47,497
[SPEAKER_09]: But these are the type of fixes, Mr. President, that with $7.5 million of money that's out there with the Water and Sewer Enterprise account,

1676
02:18:47,816 --> 02:18:56,645
[SPEAKER_09]: that we should be looking at, Mr. President, and, you know, not relying on residents to pump out their basement 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

1677
02:18:57,826 --> 02:19:05,514
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would also ask, Mr. President, that the city administration look into McCormick Ave regarding the slope and the pitch.

1678
02:19:06,415 --> 02:19:07,777
[SPEAKER_09]: This was back several years ago.

1679
02:19:07,797 --> 02:19:11,040
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure the city didn't go out there and grind the whole street.

1680
02:19:12,282 --> 02:19:15,944
[SPEAKER_09]: and properly angle the street.

1681
02:19:16,004 --> 02:19:19,326
[SPEAKER_09]: But I would ask that that be taken care of now by the city engineer.

1682
02:19:19,686 --> 02:19:20,026
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1683
02:19:21,047 --> 02:19:21,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

1684
02:19:23,228 --> 02:19:24,989
[SPEAKER_14]: So what is it we're voting on, Mr. President?

1685
02:19:25,009 --> 02:19:33,915
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to be asking the Office of Energy and the Environment in the Conservation Commission to report back to us with any potential concerns regarding the Macklin Road development.

1686
02:19:33,975 --> 02:19:37,377
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're asking for an engineering study on McCormick Avenue relative to slope and pitch.

1687
02:19:37,437 --> 02:19:38,197
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that what we're voting on?

1688
02:19:38,217 --> 02:19:38,918
[SPEAKER_13]: That is correct, Councilor Knight.

1689
02:19:39,238 --> 02:19:40,519
[SPEAKER_14]: Move approval of the question, Mr. President.

1690
02:19:42,666 --> 02:19:45,709
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Lococoon.

1691
02:19:45,849 --> 02:19:46,509
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1692
02:19:47,410 --> 02:19:50,133
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1693
02:19:50,173 --> 02:19:52,435
[SPEAKER_13]: 17446 offered by Vice President Marks.

1694
02:19:53,235 --> 02:20:00,141
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the City Council receive an updated list of tree stumps and sidewalk repairs.

1695
02:20:00,622 --> 02:20:01,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Marks.

1696
02:20:02,484 --> 02:20:03,444
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1697
02:20:03,564 --> 02:20:06,127
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate to put this on the agenda again, but guess what?

1698
02:20:06,973 --> 02:20:08,294
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to put it on the agenda again.

1699
02:20:08,314 --> 02:20:10,375
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, it was several weeks back.

1700
02:20:10,515 --> 02:20:12,317
[SPEAKER_09]: I offered a resolution asking for an update.

1701
02:20:12,357 --> 02:20:21,303
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was amended by several counselors to get an update of a sidewalk and, um, street repair, uh, and stumps.

1702
02:20:22,043 --> 02:20:24,585
[SPEAKER_09]: And to date, I don't recall receiving anything.

1703
02:20:24,625 --> 02:20:29,929
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if my fellow colleagues, sometimes it may skip a packet, but I didn't receive anything.

1704
02:20:29,949 --> 02:20:30,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

1705
02:20:31,197 --> 02:20:42,683
[SPEAKER_09]: And I could just tell you firsthand that the calls I'm receiving regarding stump removal, I must be the king of stump removal because I keep on receiving call after call from people in this community.

1706
02:20:43,223 --> 02:20:47,025
[SPEAKER_09]: And they tell me when they call city hall, they're being told they're on the list.

1707
02:20:48,305 --> 02:20:56,609
[SPEAKER_09]: And I hate to laugh at people, but that list, I tell them, could be three, four, five, 10 years before your stump gets taken out, assuming you are on the list.

1708
02:20:57,650 --> 02:21:15,519
[SPEAKER_09]: So once again, Mr. President, that I would ask, and I think Councilor Nights, the Chairman of the Public Works Subcommittee, I would ask that, like I did several weeks back regarding street sweeping, I think we have to put together, because there is no clear, in my opinion, there is no clear,

1709
02:21:16,466 --> 02:21:17,568
[SPEAKER_09]: approach in this city.

1710
02:21:17,968 --> 02:21:29,480
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not aware of any rules or regulations administratively that require stumps to be removed within a certain time frame after the tree is taken down.

1711
02:21:30,100 --> 02:21:36,527
[SPEAKER_09]: So once you have a public hearing to remove a tree, once the tree wardens out there determines the tree's unsafe or it's unhealthy,

1712
02:21:36,859 --> 02:21:37,759
[SPEAKER_09]: It needs to be removed.

1713
02:21:37,999 --> 02:21:40,460
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lengthy process that's governed by state law.

1714
02:21:41,220 --> 02:21:45,141
[SPEAKER_09]: Then what happens on our end, Mr. President, there is no process.

1715
02:21:45,601 --> 02:21:58,945
[SPEAKER_09]: So the tree will come down eventually and the stump will remain for one, two, three, four, five years in front of someone's home that is paying taxes that have been increased the last 25 years, year after year, Mr. President.

1716
02:21:59,445 --> 02:22:03,106
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would ask that the public works subcommittee, I don't think they met on the other issue.

1717
02:22:03,836 --> 02:22:09,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight has his hands full with a lot of requests that a city ordinance be created.

1718
02:22:09,179 --> 02:22:10,420
[SPEAKER_09]: This would be my recommendation.

1719
02:22:10,740 --> 02:22:12,161
[SPEAKER_09]: The subcommittee could do whatever they want.

1720
02:22:12,501 --> 02:22:26,530
[SPEAKER_09]: But within 30 days, Mr. President, of a tree removal, that the stump should be taken down to the ground, Mr. President, and also the sidewalk repaired or a new tree planted, depending on the wish of the homeowner.

1721
02:22:26,970 --> 02:22:28,611
[SPEAKER_09]: But there has to be a timeframe.

1722
02:22:28,951 --> 02:22:30,452
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't continue to operate

1723
02:22:30,816 --> 02:22:40,860
[SPEAKER_09]: this way, Mr. President, where residents are not sure they're on the list, they may be on the list, and looking at a stump, an unsightly stump in front of their home for many, many years.

1724
02:22:41,880 --> 02:22:58,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Regarding the sidewalks, Mr. President, the mayor is looking at right now a beautification process where $250,000 the mayor is putting out for each of the five business districts, so they would get $50,000 each, and looking to put out a survey in the community

1725
02:22:58,882 --> 02:23:04,286
[SPEAKER_09]: for business owners and residents to ask for beautification within the different business districts.

1726
02:23:04,926 --> 02:23:22,758
[SPEAKER_09]: And the business owners that I've spoken to, John Pompeo and Wes Maffin and other business owners throughout the community, is that they're more concerned about the basic issues of cracked sidewalks, Mr. President, the lack of signage within different business districts.

1727
02:23:23,919 --> 02:23:25,840
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what they're concerned about, Mr. President.

1728
02:23:26,490 --> 02:23:34,295
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's great to have this $50,000, and it's great to put it out there and get input from everyone, but they just want the basics.

1729
02:23:35,056 --> 02:23:36,757
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what they're explaining to me.

1730
02:23:36,837 --> 02:23:43,141
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to put in a plug, Mr. President, that I don't think we have to wait for a $250,000 offering from the mayor to have a survey go out.

1731
02:23:47,587 --> 02:23:53,189
[SPEAKER_09]: to do the basic amenities to fix a sidewalk in front of a business owner's establishment, Mr. President.

1732
02:23:53,509 --> 02:23:59,411
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we have to jump through six to eight months worth of hurdles to do basic, basic city improvements.

1733
02:23:59,951 --> 02:24:02,012
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be my recommendation, Mr. President.

1734
02:24:02,332 --> 02:24:17,277
[SPEAKER_09]: This be sent to the subcommittee on public works and that an ordinance be created to put a timeframe on when a stump will be removed after tree removal so residents don't have to wonder what's going to happen, Mr. President, any longer.

1735
02:24:17,783 --> 02:24:24,848
[SPEAKER_13]: The Public Works Subcommittee is Councilor Nye, Vice President Marks, and Councilor DelaRusso.

1736
02:24:25,028 --> 02:24:31,973
[SPEAKER_13]: And that $250,000 has been sitting there for a couple of years now, waiting for something to happen with it.

1737
02:24:32,013 --> 02:24:38,298
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's not new money or found money that's been sitting there from the, I think, McGlynn's administration.

1738
02:24:38,338 --> 02:24:41,020
[SPEAKER_13]: No, no, Mr. President, no, if I could.

1739
02:24:41,420 --> 02:24:45,603
[SPEAKER_13]: If I'm not mistaken, that was money that Mayor McGlynn put aside

1740
02:24:47,324 --> 02:24:47,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1741
02:24:48,485 --> 02:24:51,487
[SPEAKER_13]: So the beautification or whatever they want to call it.

1742
02:24:51,507 --> 02:24:52,548
[SPEAKER_09]: He put aside $250,000.

1743
02:24:52,988 --> 02:24:54,549
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor has changed it around now.

1744
02:24:54,569 --> 02:24:55,149
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a new mayor.

1745
02:24:55,750 --> 02:24:55,890
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

1746
02:24:55,910 --> 02:25:00,333
[SPEAKER_09]: This mayor is going to request that the council vote $250,000 out of free cash.

1747
02:25:00,353 --> 02:25:00,893
[SPEAKER_09]: Additional.

1748
02:25:01,093 --> 02:25:01,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Out of free cash.

1749
02:25:02,114 --> 02:25:02,734
[SPEAKER_09]: Not additional.

1750
02:25:03,175 --> 02:25:03,815
[SPEAKER_09]: Not additional.

1751
02:25:03,935 --> 02:25:06,537
[SPEAKER_09]: It's $50,000 for each business district divided by $250,000.

1752
02:25:06,597 --> 02:25:08,618
[SPEAKER_09]: That's five business districts.

1753
02:25:08,658 --> 02:25:10,560
[SPEAKER_09]: So the mayor has changed it around.

1754
02:25:10,580 --> 02:25:11,981
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's her authority.

1755
02:25:12,301 --> 02:25:14,342
[SPEAKER_09]: So she didn't follow through with it.

1756
02:25:14,402 --> 02:25:16,584
[SPEAKER_13]: I was under the impression we were using that money that was

1757
02:25:17,517 --> 02:25:19,278
[SPEAKER_13]: in that fund for a couple of years.

1758
02:25:20,698 --> 02:25:21,539
[SPEAKER_13]: Not that I'm aware of.

1759
02:25:21,939 --> 02:25:22,619
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Falco.

1760
02:25:23,440 --> 02:25:24,220
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1761
02:25:24,340 --> 02:25:26,861
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to thank Councilor Moxley for bringing this forward.

1762
02:25:27,501 --> 02:25:28,762
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a definite concern.

1763
02:25:29,302 --> 02:25:33,023
[SPEAKER_03]: You go through each neighborhood, there's stumps all over the place.

1764
02:25:33,224 --> 02:25:37,285
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would definitely be in favor of an ordinance to police this.

1765
02:25:37,505 --> 02:25:39,606
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it's long overdue.

1766
02:25:40,386 --> 02:25:44,088
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's sad that when you have stumps out there year after year,

1767
02:25:44,966 --> 02:25:46,007
[SPEAKER_03]: They need to be addressed.

1768
02:25:46,427 --> 02:25:48,808
[SPEAKER_03]: And they should be addressed right away.

1769
02:25:48,848 --> 02:25:49,789
[SPEAKER_03]: To me, it's a safety issue.

1770
02:25:50,269 --> 02:25:51,490
[SPEAKER_03]: You have kids walking down the street.

1771
02:25:51,510 --> 02:25:52,830
[SPEAKER_03]: We're encouraging people to walk.

1772
02:25:53,971 --> 02:25:55,372
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a complete streets program.

1773
02:25:56,032 --> 02:26:03,997
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're encouraging people to get out there and walk, but you're forcing people into the street when there's stumps all over the place.

1774
02:26:04,037 --> 02:26:05,317
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it needs to be addressed.

1775
02:26:05,657 --> 02:26:07,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a call from a resident the other day.

1776
02:26:07,218 --> 02:26:09,800
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a tree on his sidewalk.

1777
02:26:09,860 --> 02:26:12,001
[SPEAKER_03]: It's popping up the panel, the curbs

1778
02:26:12,540 --> 02:26:17,362
[SPEAKER_03]: falling away from the, separating from the sidewalk and that needs to be addressed.

1779
02:26:17,642 --> 02:26:20,484
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, so we have issues like this all over our community.

1780
02:26:20,504 --> 02:26:23,285
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter what neighborhood you're in, they're out there.

1781
02:26:23,405 --> 02:26:27,107
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'd be in full support of an ordinance to police this.

1782
02:26:27,167 --> 02:26:28,068
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a good idea.

1783
02:26:28,548 --> 02:26:40,994
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you wouldn't mind me amending your resolution, if we could have 49 Bradshaw Street added to the list of sidewalk repair, just as the DPW could go out there and take a look.

1784
02:26:46,156 --> 02:26:49,777
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1785
02:26:49,797 --> 02:27:04,503
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll put it, we'll put on the next one that I, if vice president box, just if I could, Mr. President, this council over the years has asked a national grid regarding double poles, their poles in the city.

1786
02:27:04,523 --> 02:27:07,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and we've required the state legislature.

1787
02:27:07,784 --> 02:27:11,445
[SPEAKER_09]: We've asked them on countless times to create a state law,

1788
02:27:12,176 --> 02:27:17,478
[SPEAKER_09]: that would put a timeframe on when National Grid can sit on these double poles, how long they can sit.

1789
02:27:17,879 --> 02:27:27,283
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was back, I think, two or three years ago, the state legislature finally put together a law, a state law, that requires National Grid to address their double poles.

1790
02:27:27,943 --> 02:27:35,606
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we are on the city side, Mr. President, where you may not have a double pole, but you may have a stump in front of your house for five years, and there's no requirement at all.

1791
02:27:36,247 --> 02:27:38,968
[SPEAKER_09]: So, there is no administrative policy that I'm aware of.

1792
02:27:39,592 --> 02:27:48,518
[SPEAKER_09]: And the fact that the administration hasn't picked up on this over the last 20 years, I think requires a city ordinance to step in and require the city.

1793
02:27:48,778 --> 02:27:49,979
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President to act on this.

1794
02:27:50,019 --> 02:27:50,340
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1795
02:27:51,000 --> 02:27:52,321
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a double pole in front of my house.

1796
02:27:53,282 --> 02:27:53,722
[SPEAKER_13]: Council.

1797
02:27:54,162 --> 02:27:56,624
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, I wasn't done yet.

1798
02:27:57,384 --> 02:27:58,385
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

1799
02:27:58,545 --> 02:27:59,566
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry.

1800
02:27:59,766 --> 02:28:08,412
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I can have a B paper to, uh, for the DPW to look at the sidewalk panel in front of, to actually the side, it's a corner lot, the corner of Honeywell and, uh,

1801
02:28:09,365 --> 02:28:12,367
[SPEAKER_13]: Bradshaw, it's 49 Bradshaw Street.

1802
02:28:12,487 --> 02:28:14,689
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I could also add, one second, one second.

1803
02:28:14,749 --> 02:28:15,229
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a B paper to 17446.

1804
02:28:15,269 --> 02:28:15,810
[SPEAKER_13]: He said the 17446.

1805
02:28:15,910 --> 02:28:18,592
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we could also have Bradshaw,

1806
02:28:39,608 --> 02:28:41,409
[SPEAKER_03]: in Honeywell, it's the corner.

1807
02:28:42,649 --> 02:28:46,931
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a raised sidewalk panel.

1808
02:28:48,451 --> 02:28:49,732
[SPEAKER_13]: And you have another one, sir?

1809
02:28:50,092 --> 02:28:55,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, if we could have the DPW department or whatever utility is responsible for this.

1810
02:28:56,454 --> 02:28:58,955
[SPEAKER_03]: There is not a half pole, not a double pole.

1811
02:28:59,035 --> 02:29:02,796
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a mini pole at the corner of Fulton Spring and Fulton Street.

1812
02:29:03,176 --> 02:29:04,877
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gotta be about four feet off the ground.

1813
02:29:05,843 --> 02:29:06,964
[SPEAKER_03]: definite safety hazard.

1814
02:29:07,004 --> 02:29:08,484
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there's kids all over the place there.

1815
02:29:09,025 --> 02:29:09,885
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a tree stump.

1816
02:29:09,905 --> 02:29:10,825
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a telephone pole.

1817
02:29:10,905 --> 02:29:12,026
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be a double pole.

1818
02:29:12,126 --> 02:29:12,486
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1819
02:29:12,706 --> 02:29:13,507
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they cut it down.

1820
02:29:13,567 --> 02:29:15,388
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a mini pole.

1821
02:29:15,668 --> 02:29:15,988
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1822
02:29:17,789 --> 02:29:18,129
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1823
02:29:18,489 --> 02:29:19,350
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor.

1824
02:29:19,730 --> 02:29:20,010
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

1825
02:29:20,030 --> 02:29:27,614
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, president Carviello, I actually have more to say about potholes, but I want to thank the, my colleague for putting this forward and I move approval.

1826
02:29:28,174 --> 02:29:28,534
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1827
02:29:30,475 --> 02:29:31,055
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor nice.

1828
02:29:31,516 --> 02:29:32,016
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President.

1829
02:29:32,036 --> 02:29:32,696
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

1830
02:29:32,736 --> 02:29:34,337
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's important to point out that, um,

1831
02:29:35,512 --> 02:29:36,852
[SPEAKER_14]: Here in the city, we have two stump lists.

1832
02:29:37,172 --> 02:29:41,713
[SPEAKER_14]: We have one stump list that the city is responsible for and one stump list that the public utility is responsible for.

1833
02:29:41,753 --> 02:29:47,675
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that Councilor Moxley is on the right track as part of the permitting process for our public utilities to come into the community to dig up our streets.

1834
02:29:48,215 --> 02:29:51,676
[SPEAKER_14]: They should also be required to take down the stumps on the trees that they've taken down.

1835
02:29:51,736 --> 02:29:53,536
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that's a nice place to start.

1836
02:29:53,556 --> 02:29:56,216
[SPEAKER_14]: It's certainly a good, a good intention.

1837
02:29:56,297 --> 02:29:58,537
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it's going to lead us in the right direction, Mr. President.

1838
02:29:59,459 --> 02:30:07,302
[SPEAKER_14]: In terms of the $250,000 for our business district, I think that nothing can improve our business districts more than improving the flow of traffic and making them more pedestrian safe.

1839
02:30:07,822 --> 02:30:12,684
[SPEAKER_14]: With that being said, I'm pretty sure that a traffic engineer will cost less than $250,000, Mr. President.

1840
02:30:13,144 --> 02:30:15,465
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure we could probably get two years of a traffic engineer out of $250,000.

1841
02:30:15,505 --> 02:30:21,288
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that being said, that would be a recommendation that I would like to make as an amendment to Councilor Falco's B paper.

1842
02:30:22,808 --> 02:30:23,728
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, Mr. President,

1843
02:30:25,783 --> 02:30:28,884
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you get that at a trap?

1844
02:30:29,204 --> 02:30:46,310
[SPEAKER_14]: $250,000 be spent for a traffic as opposed to business district beautification because ultimately if we improve the flow of traffic and we make our community more pedestrian friendly, we are going to be improving our business districts and we're going to be improving the quality of life of our city as a whole, not just in these five areas.

1845
02:30:46,350 --> 02:30:46,850
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President.

1846
02:30:47,350 --> 02:30:48,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, so with that being said, I move for approval.

1847
02:30:49,431 --> 02:30:49,771
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1848
02:30:50,051 --> 02:30:50,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Counsel Scott Pelley.

1849
02:30:51,211 --> 02:30:53,892
[SPEAKER_08]: I yell to the gentleman who approached the podium.

1850
02:30:54,628 --> 02:30:55,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Name and address of the record, please.

1851
02:30:55,889 --> 02:30:57,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul Gucciati, 37 Duden Street.

1852
02:30:58,271 --> 02:31:00,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to acknowledge the double poles.

1853
02:31:00,273 --> 02:31:04,396
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had a double pole for more than five years in Duden Street and I'll hit the potholes in a few minutes.

1854
02:31:07,598 --> 02:31:07,999
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1855
02:31:08,059 --> 02:31:08,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Counselor Scott.

1856
02:31:09,060 --> 02:31:10,721
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, I, I, and I'll hop on this.

1857
02:31:10,781 --> 02:31:22,270
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that one of my, my biggest issues coming onto the council is the lack of respect from our public utilities, um, and replacing panels and still, that's still an issue.

1858
02:31:22,310 --> 02:31:23,291
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um,

1859
02:31:24,118 --> 02:31:38,962
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like an update if we can, if we could med that to, to still, um, ask the DPW, um, if they can, um, identify, um, panels that haven't been replaced yet.

1860
02:31:39,382 --> 02:31:43,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, what, what I'm seeing is still, there was supposed to be what I've been told.

1861
02:31:43,263 --> 02:31:47,805
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been told is that they were supposed to be, uh, put back to what was originally there.

1862
02:31:47,865 --> 02:31:48,185
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

1863
02:31:48,865 --> 02:31:53,086
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we're seeing is concrete sidewalks that are now being,

1864
02:31:54,000 --> 02:31:55,781
[SPEAKER_08]: um, hot top to over.

1865
02:31:56,421 --> 02:32:03,382
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and as we all know that over time that disintegrates and it leaves a huge safety issue.

1866
02:32:03,422 --> 02:32:07,263
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we can ask the DPW for that, that'd be, that'd be wonderful.

1867
02:32:07,323 --> 02:32:07,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1868
02:32:09,544 --> 02:32:10,124
[SPEAKER_14]: Counselor knife.

1869
02:32:10,504 --> 02:32:20,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I've been waiting for a similar response from the engineering department since April of 2016 relative to the streets that have been dug up by our public utilities and the trench work that's been performed.

1870
02:32:20,487 --> 02:32:21,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President.

1871
02:32:21,413 --> 02:32:23,755
[SPEAKER_14]: I've put forward more than five resolutions on this matter.

1872
02:32:23,775 --> 02:32:24,756
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been 18 months.

1873
02:32:25,476 --> 02:32:31,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I'm going to make a friendly wager with councilor Scott Pelly that if he gets his list before I get mine, I'll take him out for dinner.

1874
02:32:32,721 --> 02:32:36,424
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not going to be that lucky.

1875
02:32:37,845 --> 02:32:46,872
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion by councilor marks seconded by councilor Longo Kern as amended by

1876
02:32:52,645 --> 02:32:56,787
[SPEAKER_13]: The first one we're going to send the first one to subcommittee, am I correct?

1877
02:32:57,188 --> 02:33:02,511
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Councillor Knight to send this to subcommittee, seconded by Councillor Longo-Kern.

1878
02:33:04,132 --> 02:33:04,913
[SPEAKER_13]: 30 day ordinance.

1879
02:33:07,534 --> 02:33:11,677
[SPEAKER_13]: And on the B paper, as amended by Councillor Falco,

1880
02:33:14,734 --> 02:33:24,837
[SPEAKER_13]: seconded by, I'm sorry, amended by Councilor Scott Pelley and Councilor Falco and Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelley.

1881
02:33:25,337 --> 02:33:26,017
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

1882
02:33:26,778 --> 02:33:30,979
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

1883
02:33:30,999 --> 02:33:39,281
[SPEAKER_13]: 17447 offered by Vice President Mox being resolved that the city's potholes and crosswalks be discussed.

1884
02:33:39,962 --> 02:33:40,822
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Mox,

1885
02:33:42,095 --> 02:33:50,659
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me preface my remarks, Mr. President, if I could, because I don't want this to reflect upon DPW and the highway department.

1886
02:33:51,980 --> 02:34:08,888
[SPEAKER_09]: And in my discussions, the highway department, which is responsible for the maintenance of our roads, sidewalks, currently right now to operate efficiently and effectively to address the issues that are reported

1887
02:34:09,272 --> 02:34:16,995
[SPEAKER_09]: through C-Click Fix, through this council, through residents, they need an additional six workers just to meet the daily requirements.

1888
02:34:17,475 --> 02:34:20,576
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're down six workers, Mr. President.

1889
02:34:20,616 --> 02:34:28,199
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't want this in any way to reflect upon a department, in my opinion, that is sorely, sorely understaffed.

1890
02:34:28,659 --> 02:34:31,560
[SPEAKER_09]: But I had to bring it up tonight because I don't like what I'm seeing.

1891
02:34:31,580 --> 02:34:37,982
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I've been driving in this community for 35 years, and I can unequivocally say

1892
02:34:38,388 --> 02:34:42,032
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never seen our roads in worse condition, to be quite frank.

1893
02:34:42,572 --> 02:34:44,114
[SPEAKER_09]: I've never seen them in worse condition.

1894
02:34:44,615 --> 02:34:53,724
[SPEAKER_09]: And now I'm seeing, Mr. President, and I don't know if my council colleagues have noticed, people are starting to paint orange neon around potholes.

1895
02:34:54,605 --> 02:34:56,327
[SPEAKER_09]: So I inquired when I saw them, I said,

1896
02:34:56,852 --> 02:34:58,553
[SPEAKER_09]: Geez, why are people putting orange neon?

1897
02:34:59,114 --> 02:35:18,747
[SPEAKER_09]: It's actually nice because I know to avoid the pothole, but I was told it's being done by residents, Mr. President, that are so sick and tired of having the same pothole on their street for month after month, year after year, Mr. President, some of these potholes, that they're actually calling light to these particular potholes.

1898
02:35:19,148 --> 02:35:20,929
[SPEAKER_09]: And they look like mini crime scenes.

1899
02:35:21,352 --> 02:35:26,755
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like almost a body was there, Mr. President, based on the size of the pothole.

1900
02:35:27,516 --> 02:35:36,121
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition to the potholes, Mr. President, that for whatever reason, and maybe it's because we're understaffed, we're unable to keep on top of them.

1901
02:35:36,901 --> 02:35:43,025
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not sure why, I'm not sure, maybe our streets are so old that this is what we're faced with now.

1902
02:35:44,285 --> 02:35:48,728
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we should have had a systematic approach to replacing our streets.

1903
02:35:49,091 --> 02:35:50,352
[SPEAKER_09]: which never happened over the years.

1904
02:35:50,692 --> 02:36:00,516
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're at a place right now where there's in such deplorable condition, just patching a hole really doesn't do it merit.

1905
02:36:01,276 --> 02:36:03,037
[SPEAKER_09]: And the manhole covers.

1906
02:36:03,803 --> 02:36:09,385
[SPEAKER_09]: How many streets do you have to go down and avoid the manhole cover because it's sloping down?

1907
02:36:10,105 --> 02:36:13,966
[SPEAKER_09]: How many streets do you have to go over that you have to say, well, I got to avoid this manhole cover?

1908
02:36:14,286 --> 02:36:20,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Or if I get too close to the curb, I get near a catch basin that's almost sunk into the ground and I have to avoid that.

1909
02:36:20,928 --> 02:36:24,429
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like you're playing a Nintendo game when you're driving on these streets.

1910
02:36:24,849 --> 02:36:26,910
[SPEAKER_09]: They're that deplorable, Mr. President.

1911
02:36:27,490 --> 02:36:29,971
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I'm not sure what it's going to take.

1912
02:36:29,991 --> 02:36:31,031
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, we hear about

1913
02:36:31,512 --> 02:36:35,075
[SPEAKER_09]: complete streets, we hear about this is going on, that's going on.

1914
02:36:35,495 --> 02:36:37,878
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the very basics that we need to address.

1915
02:36:38,979 --> 02:36:40,140
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the very basics.

1916
02:36:40,600 --> 02:36:51,970
[SPEAKER_09]: And what do you tell a resident that their taxes have gone up steadily each year for 25 years, while the city services are going down, saying, well, you know what, we can't afford to do the basic maintenance.

1917
02:36:52,390 --> 02:36:57,535
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't afford to do the basic city maintenance, Mr. President, that we need to do in this community.

1918
02:36:58,395 --> 02:36:58,936
[SPEAKER_09]: And again,

1919
02:36:59,325 --> 02:37:02,948
[SPEAKER_09]: The number of emails and calls I get, it's getting overwhelming.

1920
02:37:03,489 --> 02:37:07,412
[SPEAKER_09]: And I asked people, I said, you may be better off reporting it to C-Click Fix.

1921
02:37:08,333 --> 02:37:15,078
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think the frustration with that is they get a quick answer saying, we'll take it under advisement, and nothing ever happens.

1922
02:37:15,819 --> 02:37:22,164
[SPEAKER_09]: So I hate to do it, Mr. President, but I have to put a few roads on there that were brought to my attention.

1923
02:37:22,665 --> 02:37:25,567
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know people are gonna say, well, it's every road, and I agree with them.

1924
02:37:26,055 --> 02:37:29,837
[SPEAKER_09]: But Tamar Drive has a hole that you can lose a small car in.

1925
02:37:30,257 --> 02:37:31,438
[SPEAKER_09]: That's how bad it is.

1926
02:37:32,538 --> 02:37:39,342
[SPEAKER_09]: Salem Street still has the railroad tracks from 1930 that ran down Salem Street that you can see through the road.

1927
02:37:39,582 --> 02:37:40,802
[SPEAKER_09]: How long have I been asking for that?

1928
02:37:41,663 --> 02:37:42,183
[SPEAKER_09]: How long?

1929
02:37:42,223 --> 02:37:44,604
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, talk about your request.

1930
02:37:44,884 --> 02:37:50,487
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you're talking a year, two years that you can still see the tracks underneath, Mr. President.

1931
02:37:51,188 --> 02:37:51,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Riverside Ave?

1932
02:37:53,254 --> 02:38:05,077
[SPEAKER_09]: between the slopes and the catch basins and the manhole covers and Winthrop Street towards Boston Ave, another area that is in deplorable condition.

1933
02:38:05,517 --> 02:38:10,559
[SPEAKER_09]: The raised crosswalk should be painted every year so people know there's a raised crosswalk.

1934
02:38:11,519 --> 02:38:16,880
[SPEAKER_09]: You go by, you can barely tell the difference between the raised crosswalk and the street, Mr. President.

1935
02:38:17,380 --> 02:38:19,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Secondly, we talk about crosswalks.

1936
02:38:19,821 --> 02:38:22,722
[SPEAKER_09]: How often do we talk about getting our crosswalks painted?

1937
02:38:23,554 --> 02:38:29,015
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd venture to say that 70 percent of our crosswalks, still to date, are not painted.

1938
02:38:29,955 --> 02:38:31,876
[SPEAKER_09]: To date, Mr. President, are not painted.

1939
02:38:32,556 --> 02:38:35,196
[SPEAKER_09]: We had the Traffic Commission several weeks back.

1940
02:38:36,817 --> 02:38:42,378
[SPEAKER_09]: An amendment was offered before the Traffic Commission to allow Meffitt Police to now tag for jaywalking.

1941
02:38:42,958 --> 02:38:45,999
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, they didn't have the ability to tag for jaywalking.

1942
02:38:46,359 --> 02:38:52,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Jaywalking, from my understanding, is crossing a street that is not in a recommended cross area, like a crosswalk.

1943
02:38:53,659 --> 02:39:01,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, how do you tell residents to cross in a crosswalk that's not painted and not visual to those that are driving in the street?

1944
02:39:02,383 --> 02:39:03,984
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't make any sense, Mr. President.

1945
02:39:04,704 --> 02:39:11,227
[SPEAKER_09]: This council has voted, I know you brought it up several occasions, and I've mentioned it ad nauseum for 15 years.

1946
02:39:11,827 --> 02:39:14,108
[SPEAKER_09]: Thermoplastic crosswalks.

1947
02:39:15,048 --> 02:39:19,310
[SPEAKER_09]: Highly reflective, slip-resistant, their life expectancy is five years.

1948
02:39:21,011 --> 02:39:22,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they a little more expensive?

1949
02:39:22,352 --> 02:39:22,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Absolutely.

1950
02:39:24,295 --> 02:39:25,276
[SPEAKER_09]: The state uses it.

1951
02:39:25,956 --> 02:39:28,178
[SPEAKER_09]: They use it on state highways, state roads.

1952
02:39:28,638 --> 02:39:30,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no, the city of Meffitt knows better.

1953
02:39:30,399 --> 02:39:32,321
[SPEAKER_09]: We can't use thermoplastic in this city.

1954
02:39:32,861 --> 02:39:34,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no, it's too expensive, Mr. President.

1955
02:39:35,223 --> 02:39:39,266
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll just have to fight every year to get our crosswalks painted for six months.

1956
02:39:39,646 --> 02:39:41,628
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the time they get done, it's wintertime.

1957
02:39:42,809 --> 02:39:51,615
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I don't know what's going on, but, you know, I'm tired of hearing about all these little niches that are out there, safe roads and safe streets.

1958
02:39:51,675 --> 02:39:52,916
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is what's going on.

1959
02:39:53,252 --> 02:39:54,713
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's all it is, Mr. President.

1960
02:39:55,113 --> 02:40:02,858
[SPEAKER_09]: It's only a little niche, and it doesn't address the entire city's needs, which are basic needs, streets and sidewalks, Mr. President.

1961
02:40:03,578 --> 02:40:10,563
[SPEAKER_09]: So, again, I would ask that we have our pothole patrol team, which I guess it sounds good to say.

1962
02:40:10,583 --> 02:40:17,627
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we have one, but we get our pothole patrol team out there and start filling these potholes, Mr. President.

1963
02:40:18,384 --> 02:40:23,507
[SPEAKER_09]: and if they can't get the substance to fill them, we can get creative.

1964
02:40:23,888 --> 02:40:25,128
[SPEAKER_09]: Other communities, you know what they've done?

1965
02:40:25,469 --> 02:40:26,829
[SPEAKER_09]: They've done adopt a site.

1966
02:40:27,890 --> 02:40:38,737
[SPEAKER_09]: It may sound dangerous, but you have people that will go and adopt a pothole, they'll fill it with cement, they'll make pitches in there, they'll do mosaics, and it really, it's actually very catchy.

1967
02:40:39,798 --> 02:40:43,240
[SPEAKER_09]: But this is how their approach is to getting the city to act.

1968
02:40:43,840 --> 02:40:47,863
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe our approach is to do neon around the potholes, and I think it's effective.

1969
02:40:48,724 --> 02:40:49,824
[SPEAKER_09]: I, you know, I thank the residents.

1970
02:40:49,844 --> 02:40:53,885
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope they don't get hurt doing it, but I thank the residents cause it calls the pothole to attention.

1971
02:40:54,205 --> 02:40:58,766
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it puts people in the city on notice saying, Hey, look, how long is this going to last?

1972
02:40:59,347 --> 02:41:01,547
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to, we're going to call you out on it.

1973
02:41:01,567 --> 02:41:03,288
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to, we're going to outline it in neon.

1974
02:41:04,208 --> 02:41:08,649
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate to be winded about it, Mr. President, but these are basic needs that aren't being addressed.

1975
02:41:09,829 --> 02:41:13,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Vice presidents, council logo, current.

1976
02:41:14,084 --> 02:41:15,445
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you, President Carviello.

1977
02:41:15,465 --> 02:41:22,612
[SPEAKER_23]: I was going to put this on under suspension, the pothole part of it, because I too, but I thank Councilor Marks for beating me to it.

1978
02:41:24,373 --> 02:41:31,079
[SPEAKER_23]: The pothole problem, I've never seen, I don't think I've ever seen it so bad in my 16 years.

1979
02:41:32,140 --> 02:41:38,005
[SPEAKER_23]: Everywhere you drive, you are dodging, you are dodging your tire from being blown out.

1980
02:41:38,385 --> 02:41:40,087
[SPEAKER_23]: Everywhere I walk in my neighborhood,

1981
02:41:40,837 --> 02:41:42,758
[SPEAKER_23]: I've been snapping pictures like crazy.

1982
02:41:42,878 --> 02:41:44,679
[SPEAKER_23]: I've been getting complaints like crazy.

1983
02:41:45,080 --> 02:41:53,405
[SPEAKER_23]: And in my neighborhood where I live, there's no circles in neon yellow, but my neighbors are putting sand in the potholes.

1984
02:41:53,885 --> 02:42:00,609
[SPEAKER_23]: Whether or not that's a good or safe thing, I don't know, but I've gone around and I'm looking at potholes I saw a couple weeks ago, and they're filled with sand.

1985
02:42:01,110 --> 02:42:07,954
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think it does probably help the car, but whether or not residents should be putting sand in it is obviously a question.

1986
02:42:08,455 --> 02:42:11,316
[SPEAKER_23]: But I think it just goes to show how frustrated people are.

1987
02:42:11,797 --> 02:42:14,598
[SPEAKER_23]: And I don't know what the problem is either.

1988
02:42:14,618 --> 02:42:23,303
[SPEAKER_23]: And every time I do contact the DPW, they do respond to my concerns and they go and fill the potholes.

1989
02:42:23,363 --> 02:42:34,748
[SPEAKER_23]: But some sections where it needs to be completely dug up and re-put in, whether that's a portion of the street or a larger section of the road, that's not being done.

1990
02:42:34,788 --> 02:42:37,009
[SPEAKER_23]: We just don't have the time or the manpower to do it.

1991
02:42:37,049 --> 02:42:37,990
[SPEAKER_23]: And that's unfortunate.

1992
02:42:38,371 --> 02:42:40,993
[SPEAKER_23]: We're putting quick fixes on some and not on others.

1993
02:42:41,073 --> 02:42:43,594
[SPEAKER_23]: So I think we need a systematic approach.

1994
02:42:43,694 --> 02:42:50,799
[SPEAKER_23]: And if we need to put more money in to doing it or hire a private contractor to go street by street, it needs to be done.

1995
02:42:51,619 --> 02:43:03,927
[SPEAKER_23]: If you look on Highland and Rita, there are huge potholes and a catch basin almost completely fallen in the road.

1996
02:43:04,267 --> 02:43:05,628
[SPEAKER_23]: You go to Doonan Street, there are

1997
02:43:06,235 --> 02:43:13,820
[SPEAKER_23]: patch after patch after patch that keeps coming up and you have crumbling road.

1998
02:43:14,280 --> 02:43:20,805
[SPEAKER_23]: If you look on Short Street, there are potholes filled with sand, and this is just my neighborhood.

1999
02:43:20,845 --> 02:43:22,806
[SPEAKER_23]: Then you go down and you go down Bell Ave.

2000
02:43:23,446 --> 02:43:27,989
[SPEAKER_23]: Some have been fixed, thankfully, but you go to the end of Bell Ave, and it's a mess.

2001
02:43:28,249 --> 02:43:29,350
[SPEAKER_23]: It is an absolute mess.

2002
02:43:29,410 --> 02:43:33,593
[SPEAKER_23]: That road's always considered a roller coaster in my family, Roller Coaster Road.

2003
02:43:34,062 --> 02:43:37,765
[SPEAKER_23]: But you go to every adjacent street, it's just pothole after pothole.

2004
02:43:38,185 --> 02:43:40,466
[SPEAKER_23]: And we need to figure out a way to address it.

2005
02:43:40,507 --> 02:43:53,896
[SPEAKER_23]: So I'm asking, through an amendment, that our subcommittee or even a committee of the whole meet with the DPW director and say, if we're only getting to some of these complaints on C-Click Fix, it's not enough, and what can we do?

2006
02:43:54,316 --> 02:43:56,778
[SPEAKER_23]: Because it's been talked about tonight.

2007
02:43:56,818 --> 02:44:00,040
[SPEAKER_23]: We have $250,000 for our streets that we may or may not approve.

2008
02:44:00,360 --> 02:44:02,542
[SPEAKER_23]: That survey, by the way, I believe already went out.

2009
02:44:03,287 --> 02:44:04,588
[SPEAKER_23]: to the business districts.

2010
02:44:04,648 --> 02:44:10,552
[SPEAKER_23]: I have seen it online, so people are, I believe, starting, they're requesting people to fill that out.

2011
02:44:11,412 --> 02:44:13,533
[SPEAKER_23]: We need basic city services.

2012
02:44:13,914 --> 02:44:30,464
[SPEAKER_23]: This happens every few years where it just gets so bad that this council's left saying, please, just fill potholes, paint the sidewalks, fix signage that needs to be, I mean, just the simple things that need to be done for the residents, for the safety of our community.

2013
02:44:30,864 --> 02:44:31,805
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd love to know how many,

2014
02:44:32,840 --> 02:44:50,389
[SPEAKER_23]: Pothole tire bus are in our law department right now with regards to you know people seeking reimbursement Because it's it's ridiculous, and I think we need to figure out a way well I think committee of the whole might be the way to go and just to ask questions What are we doing are we going street by street?

2015
02:44:50,449 --> 02:45:01,735
[SPEAKER_23]: Are we just going based on complaints because based on complaints isn't enough it really isn't enough, and I'm sure every week I'm getting new complaints about potholes alone crosswalks

2016
02:45:02,871 --> 02:45:13,959
[SPEAKER_23]: That's another story, but for me, the complaints are really, really coming in with regards to the potholes, and you see it as you're walking or driving around the city, and I really think something needs to be done.

2017
02:45:13,979 --> 02:45:16,220
[SPEAKER_23]: I think we need to get a grasp on it as a council.

2018
02:45:16,661 --> 02:45:22,805
[SPEAKER_23]: I know we will do that come June when we meet with the DPW director in person, but I think that's too far to wait.

2019
02:45:22,825 --> 02:45:27,948
[SPEAKER_23]: I think within the next couple weeks, we should sit down and say, what can we do to help, what

2020
02:45:29,456 --> 02:45:32,519
[SPEAKER_23]: do to ask this administration to make sure we have enough fill.

2021
02:45:32,879 --> 02:45:33,600
[SPEAKER_23]: Is that a problem?

2022
02:45:33,620 --> 02:45:34,580
[SPEAKER_23]: Do we have enough fill?

2023
02:45:34,901 --> 02:45:36,382
[SPEAKER_23]: Do we not have enough manpower?

2024
02:45:37,923 --> 02:45:41,807
[SPEAKER_23]: What are we, what are we doing wrong or what can we do right to make this right?

2025
02:45:42,327 --> 02:45:45,250
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, because it's, it's just extremely unsafe.

2026
02:45:45,330 --> 02:45:48,172
[SPEAKER_23]: It's unsightly and it's something we need to get a handle on.

2027
02:45:48,833 --> 02:45:49,714
[SPEAKER_13]: June is in two weeks.

2028
02:45:50,314 --> 02:45:51,655
[SPEAKER_13]: Counselor Nights.

2029
02:45:51,735 --> 02:45:52,416
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Mr. President.

2030
02:45:52,436 --> 02:45:53,157
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

2031
02:45:53,197 --> 02:45:54,218
[SPEAKER_14]: I moved to amend the paper.

2032
02:45:54,318 --> 02:45:55,819
[SPEAKER_14]: I have several amendments I'd like to add.

2033
02:45:56,699 --> 02:46:07,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Back in 2016, I filed a resolution requesting that the DPW, namely the engineering department, provide us with an estimate as to what it would cost to totally resurface the emergency arteries in our community.

2034
02:46:08,744 --> 02:46:12,765
[SPEAKER_14]: They came back with an estimate of $6.75 million at that time, Mr. President.

2035
02:46:13,425 --> 02:46:22,409
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd ask for an updated cost estimate as to what it would cost to resurface the emergency arteries in the city of Medford, Clerk Finn.

2036
02:46:23,329 --> 02:46:26,130
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'd also like to ask when each street

2037
02:46:26,575 --> 02:46:30,056
[SPEAKER_14]: that is designated as an emergency artery was last resurfaced.

2038
02:46:33,137 --> 02:46:33,797
[SPEAKER_14]: Second amendment.

2039
02:46:33,817 --> 02:46:50,141
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I'd like to make, uh, would be this, um, back about eight months ago, the Medford city council recommended that the DPW division, um, examine the feasibility of creating a standalone signage and striping department to address some of the concerns that we have relative to signage and striping.

2040
02:46:50,741 --> 02:46:51,321
[SPEAKER_14]: Makes sense, right?

2041
02:46:52,040 --> 02:46:54,782
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, so I'd ask for an update, Mr. President, as we prepare for the budget.

2042
02:46:55,043 --> 02:47:01,888
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I'd like to reiterate the council's position that this is something that we'd like to see examined and potentially be placed in the DPW budget.

2043
02:47:03,069 --> 02:47:14,358
[SPEAKER_14]: And, um, third, Mr. President, I'd like to amend the paper requesting that the engineering division provide written response to the Memphis city council as to why paper one six four zero four has not been answered yet after a year and a half.

2044
02:47:17,080 --> 02:47:17,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Falco.

2045
02:47:18,121 --> 02:47:18,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2046
02:47:18,941 --> 02:47:20,863
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank my council colleague, uh,

2047
02:47:21,705 --> 02:47:22,846
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Moxley bring this forward.

2048
02:47:23,466 --> 02:47:27,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, this is definitely a concern in every neighborhood, uh, throughout our city.

2049
02:47:27,869 --> 02:47:32,411
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I would definitely be in favor of having a committee, the whole meeting to discuss this.

2050
02:47:33,052 --> 02:47:37,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, it's, you know, we talk about emergency arteries, but this is just everywhere.

2051
02:47:37,674 --> 02:47:41,897
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you go to, you can go to pray every side street, you're going to find something.

2052
02:47:41,997 --> 02:47:47,300
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, there are some major issues, uh, throughout, um, throughout our community in every neighborhood.

2053
02:47:47,560 --> 02:47:50,202
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get calls about them just like my colleagues do.

2054
02:47:50,462 --> 02:47:50,842
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh,

2055
02:47:52,714 --> 02:48:01,220
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could add the lower half of Fern Road to that list, there is a hole that's getting bigger by the day.

2056
02:48:01,240 --> 02:48:04,342
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we could add that on, I'd greatly appreciate it.

2057
02:48:04,622 --> 02:48:09,426
[SPEAKER_03]: It needs to be addressed because someone is seriously gonna do some serious damage to their car.

2058
02:48:09,786 --> 02:48:11,047
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you very much.

2059
02:48:11,567 --> 02:48:11,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2060
02:48:11,867 --> 02:48:20,013
[SPEAKER_13]: And it was a request that I made, I think two years ago, asking for a permanent sidewalk crew.

2061
02:48:20,532 --> 02:48:22,193
[SPEAKER_13]: There were just two sidewalks every day.

2062
02:48:22,213 --> 02:48:26,575
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, we're still waiting an answer for that.

2063
02:48:26,895 --> 02:48:29,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, Mr. President, if I may.

2064
02:48:29,496 --> 02:48:33,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Last weekend, a resolution with regard to see click fix.

2065
02:48:34,238 --> 02:48:42,702
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could just get an update as to when we're going to receive that list, because it would be beneficial to all of us that we receive that list before the budget hearing.

2066
02:48:42,782 --> 02:48:49,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, you talk about, you know, staffing and we only we we all know that we need

2067
02:48:50,379 --> 02:48:59,404
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, more people on that department, but you get a true indication when you take a look at that secret quick fix, you can use it as a tool, uh, you know, to actually see what's not getting done.

2068
02:48:59,664 --> 02:49:01,945
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, uh, it would, it would tell a good picture.

2069
02:49:01,965 --> 02:49:04,146
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we could get an updated to one, we will receive that.

2070
02:49:04,566 --> 02:49:05,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Greatly appreciate it.

2071
02:49:05,227 --> 02:49:05,547
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2072
02:49:05,807 --> 02:49:06,087
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2073
02:49:07,027 --> 02:49:07,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Director, please.

2074
02:49:08,228 --> 02:49:10,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul Gucciari, 37 Duden street.

2075
02:49:10,069 --> 02:49:14,071
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want to thank everybody and acknowledge your counselors for bringing this forward.

2076
02:49:14,111 --> 02:49:15,131
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got some ideas.

2077
02:49:15,992 --> 02:49:19,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, one is, uh, I heard $7 million today you have in the waterfront,

2078
02:49:20,424 --> 02:49:24,284
[SPEAKER_02]: reappropriate some of that money to repair the roads.

2079
02:49:24,875 --> 02:49:28,036
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're shaking your head, but you've got to look at it.

2080
02:49:28,877 --> 02:49:29,817
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got free cash.

2081
02:49:29,877 --> 02:49:33,558
[SPEAKER_02]: And another thing I would suggest, you said you're short staff.

2082
02:49:34,359 --> 02:49:38,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Contractors, bring them in during the spring, during the fall, get them to clear the roads.

2083
02:49:38,540 --> 02:49:39,581
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets done.

2084
02:49:39,801 --> 02:49:41,181
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not adding much overhead.

2085
02:49:41,201 --> 02:49:44,102
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not paying for health care or things like that.

2086
02:49:44,122 --> 02:49:45,543
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not permanent on the payroll.

2087
02:49:46,903 --> 02:49:50,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I would also suggest what you said, 30 days for the trees not being cut, the stumps.

2088
02:49:51,465 --> 02:49:54,707
[SPEAKER_02]: Establish a service level agreements with the different departments in the city.

2089
02:49:55,428 --> 02:49:58,530
[SPEAKER_02]: So 30 days to do some work, if they're not done, you fine them.

2090
02:49:59,511 --> 02:50:00,972
[SPEAKER_02]: I live with that every day in my job.

2091
02:50:01,472 --> 02:50:06,115
[SPEAKER_02]: If I don't do something for the customer within a certain amount of time, I owe them money.

2092
02:50:06,635 --> 02:50:08,096
[SPEAKER_02]: So you could work something out like that.

2093
02:50:08,857 --> 02:50:19,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Another idea is as a police are patrolling the streets, maybe they could take some notes, turn it in in their daily report and say, how many, I see a pothole there, I see a pothole there.

2094
02:50:19,982 --> 02:50:25,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the orange signs last summer on the streets going by LaCoste is on the way to work every day.

2095
02:50:25,764 --> 02:50:27,804
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, oh, finally, the city is going to do something.

2096
02:50:28,445 --> 02:50:29,125
[SPEAKER_02]: Did it get done?

2097
02:50:29,185 --> 02:50:30,305
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the paint just wore out.

2098
02:50:32,146 --> 02:50:37,207
[SPEAKER_02]: So all I can say is, as you're talking to the departments, is there any pride in the city?

2099
02:50:38,608 --> 02:50:41,248
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have pride in the city, then something will be done.

2100
02:50:42,449 --> 02:50:42,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

2101
02:50:43,069 --> 02:50:43,329
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2102
02:50:47,533 --> 02:50:49,194
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, the gentleman makes a good point.

2103
02:50:49,315 --> 02:50:59,163
[SPEAKER_14]: And in other communities that surround the city, namely the city of Boston, which is very successful, um, in the delivery of public works projects based upon, especially based upon the size.

2104
02:50:59,563 --> 02:51:03,807
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the things that they've implemented in the city of Boston, I believe would be a residency requirement for department heads.

2105
02:51:05,128 --> 02:51:09,872
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that that's something that might warrant a little bit of examination, Mr. President.

2106
02:51:09,932 --> 02:51:15,777
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, ultimately if someone lives in the community and they have to go to the same supermarket that we have to go to and listen to the same complaints that we have to listen to,

2107
02:51:16,170 --> 02:51:19,252
[SPEAKER_14]: and the same concerns that we're here for and here to address.

2108
02:51:19,592 --> 02:51:37,964
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I just think it makes them take a little bit more pride in their job because, um, I know as I think back to, um, former gentleman that was working in our school department and, um, he was called to the carpet for, for some actions and the quote in the newspaper was, well, it's very easy for this gentleman to get in his car and drive up to Bellingham at the end to Beverly at the end of the day.

2109
02:51:38,584 --> 02:51:41,666
[SPEAKER_14]: But those of us that live in this community and call it home,

2110
02:51:42,073 --> 02:51:43,433
[SPEAKER_14]: care about it and care what's going on.

2111
02:51:43,494 --> 02:51:44,494
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have a vested interest.

2112
02:51:44,534 --> 02:51:47,095
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that that's something that we might want to examine as well, Mr. President.

2113
02:51:47,235 --> 02:51:48,175
[SPEAKER_14]: Move approval on the question.

2114
02:51:48,615 --> 02:51:49,696
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Night.

2115
02:51:50,516 --> 02:51:58,739
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion by Vice President Marks, seconded by Councilor Knight as amended by Councilor Falco.

2116
02:51:59,539 --> 02:52:00,299
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

2117
02:52:02,280 --> 02:52:06,241
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks.

2118
02:52:06,481 --> 02:52:07,302
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks.

2119
02:52:08,082 --> 02:52:09,783
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

2120
02:52:09,863 --> 02:52:10,423
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

2121
02:52:11,508 --> 02:52:12,288
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's it.

2122
02:52:14,489 --> 02:52:20,830
[SPEAKER_13]: And if we could request that we have a Council of the Whole meeting as soon as possible to discuss these matters.

2123
02:52:21,510 --> 02:52:23,751
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is just a separate amendment?

2124
02:52:24,231 --> 02:52:24,851
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

2125
02:52:25,131 --> 02:52:34,133
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to do this paper and then we'll be recommended that we have a Committee of the Whole meeting to discuss this matter.

2126
02:52:34,633 --> 02:52:35,934
[SPEAKER_13]: I will call a Committee of the Whole meeting.

2127
02:52:37,454 --> 02:52:40,095
[SPEAKER_13]: I will call a Committee of the Whole meeting.

2128
02:52:40,195 --> 02:52:40,875
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

2129
02:52:42,212 --> 02:52:43,073
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

2130
02:52:45,595 --> 02:52:46,216
[SPEAKER_14]: For just a moment.

2131
02:52:46,616 --> 02:52:47,237
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

2132
02:52:47,477 --> 02:52:52,862
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd just like to take an opportunity to thank the tree warden and the forestry division.

2133
02:52:53,302 --> 02:52:57,466
[SPEAKER_14]: Two weeks ago we put forward a request asking for a tree to be replaced in front of 112 Grant Ave.

2134
02:52:57,967 --> 02:52:58,768
[SPEAKER_14]: That work's been done.

2135
02:52:58,828 --> 02:53:00,429
[SPEAKER_14]: It was done like in two days.

2136
02:53:00,809 --> 02:53:05,013
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm very thankful for the work that they do and I appreciate their prompt response to the inquiry.

2137
02:53:06,154 --> 02:53:06,475
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2138
02:53:08,164 --> 02:53:20,598
[SPEAKER_13]: 17456 offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Richard Bubba Matos on his recent passing.

2139
02:53:20,678 --> 02:53:21,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Knight.

2140
02:53:21,959 --> 02:53:22,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Mr. President.

2141
02:53:23,541 --> 02:53:26,965
[SPEAKER_14]: After a brief illness, Mr. Matos passed away.

2142
02:53:27,565 --> 02:53:28,847
[SPEAKER_14]: Services were held yesterday.

2143
02:53:29,796 --> 02:53:35,620
[SPEAKER_14]: He was a great fellow, a gentleman that always opened the doors to his home and let us kids run wild in there.

2144
02:53:35,900 --> 02:53:40,403
[SPEAKER_14]: He kept letting us come back day after day and year after year, and he was really just a great individual.

2145
02:53:40,503 --> 02:53:47,447
[SPEAKER_14]: He had a great sense of community, a great sense of pride in his neighborhood, and he will be sadly missed down on Bradshaw Street, Mr. President, and beyond.

2146
02:53:47,467 --> 02:53:53,471
[SPEAKER_14]: I move for approval of the paper and ask my council colleagues to join me in extending condolences to the family.

2147
02:53:54,512 --> 02:53:56,173
[SPEAKER_14]: If we could raise for a moment of silence, please.

2148
02:54:07,896 --> 02:54:20,206
[SPEAKER_13]: 17454 petition by Jean M. Martin, 10 Cumming Street, Medford, to address the council on mother-in-law apartments being converted to condos or two families.

2149
02:54:21,069 --> 02:54:22,571
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please.

2150
02:54:22,851 --> 02:54:23,191
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2151
02:54:23,231 --> 02:54:24,573
[SPEAKER_22]: Gene Martin, 10 Cummings Street.

2152
02:54:25,233 --> 02:54:30,518
[SPEAKER_22]: A couple of weeks ago, one of the houses on my street got flipped.

2153
02:54:32,080 --> 02:54:35,924
[SPEAKER_22]: And while everything was above board, I'm not complaining about the way it was handled.

2154
02:54:36,164 --> 02:54:37,105
[SPEAKER_22]: It was within the law.

2155
02:54:37,706 --> 02:54:39,888
[SPEAKER_22]: But I just want to make people aware of a couple of things.

2156
02:54:41,812 --> 02:54:50,820
[SPEAKER_22]: First of all is the human interest, the human side of it, which is that I would encourage mother-in-law apartments or father-in-law apartments or sons or whatever.

2157
02:54:52,141 --> 02:54:56,886
[SPEAKER_22]: Because it's better than warehousing them in a nursing home or whatever.

2158
02:54:57,606 --> 02:55:00,169
[SPEAKER_22]: If you can't afford $5,000 to $6,000, $7,000 a month, then you end up farming them out.

2159
02:55:04,298 --> 02:55:06,319
[SPEAKER_22]: into large facilities.

2160
02:55:06,899 --> 02:55:07,659
[SPEAKER_22]: So that's number one.

2161
02:55:07,699 --> 02:55:15,863
[SPEAKER_22]: Number two, developers come in here, they swoop in like vultures.

2162
02:55:16,403 --> 02:55:16,943
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a hot

2163
02:55:17,387 --> 02:55:19,788
[SPEAKER_22]: City right now, it's been hot for three or four or five years.

2164
02:55:20,728 --> 02:55:28,692
[SPEAKER_22]: And if I collected all of the postcards and letters that I get from real estate people and developers, I would look like Santa Claus.

2165
02:55:29,032 --> 02:55:30,532
[SPEAKER_22]: I would have a bag filled with them.

2166
02:55:32,433 --> 02:55:37,435
[SPEAKER_22]: They come in, and in this case, it happened to me on my street.

2167
02:55:37,915 --> 02:55:44,018
[SPEAKER_22]: Not that it's gonna make or break the city, the street, that one house was converted to two condos.

2168
02:55:44,766 --> 02:55:46,867
[SPEAKER_22]: There was originally a single family house.

2169
02:55:47,607 --> 02:55:52,628
[SPEAKER_22]: They had a mother-in-law apartment, and they got permission to turn it into a two-family.

2170
02:55:52,928 --> 02:55:54,149
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a single family.

2171
02:55:54,549 --> 02:55:58,710
[SPEAKER_22]: They took out all the green grass in the back so that they could have the parking that's required.

2172
02:55:59,090 --> 02:56:00,450
[SPEAKER_22]: So now you lost the green space.

2173
02:56:01,271 --> 02:56:04,752
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'll get to that, but I have a chip on my shoulder about developers.

2174
02:56:05,152 --> 02:56:06,572
[SPEAKER_22]: So I want to get that off my chest.

2175
02:56:08,713 --> 02:56:10,593
[SPEAKER_22]: Developers come in here from outside.

2176
02:56:10,933 --> 02:56:12,494
[SPEAKER_22]: They flip at the house, and they leave.

2177
02:56:14,047 --> 02:56:15,348
[SPEAKER_22]: that's great for them.

2178
02:56:16,589 --> 02:56:19,311
[SPEAKER_22]: And the other thing is, you guys were talking about water.

2179
02:56:20,052 --> 02:56:24,555
[SPEAKER_22]: Development doesn't mean it's good for me and my street.

2180
02:56:25,336 --> 02:56:31,260
[SPEAKER_22]: When they built across the way, they pitched the driveway, so now the water came into my basement.

2181
02:56:31,701 --> 02:56:38,026
[SPEAKER_22]: So I used to have a little flower bed, not much, a little mulch, little flowers, little few rocks with the bricks around it.

2182
02:56:38,486 --> 02:56:42,409
[SPEAKER_22]: I had to pave over that because I had to raise my pitch

2183
02:56:42,890 --> 02:56:45,952
[SPEAKER_22]: so that now it goes back down to the street and then down the street.

2184
02:56:45,992 --> 02:56:47,312
[SPEAKER_22]: So it was great for them.

2185
02:56:47,973 --> 02:56:58,318
[SPEAKER_22]: The other thing, the third point, and I'm trying to be quick, I know it's late, but I want to make you aware that the third point was conflicts, okay?

2186
02:56:59,078 --> 02:57:00,259
[SPEAKER_22]: Conflicts between neighbors.

2187
02:57:00,379 --> 02:57:01,480
[SPEAKER_22]: Fences make good neighbors.

2188
02:57:02,000 --> 02:57:07,503
[SPEAKER_22]: And when you have a single family house that had the second floor turned into

2189
02:57:08,510 --> 02:57:14,636
[SPEAKER_22]: a mother-in-law apartment, which at least they're family, so they're connected, they're relational, it's not so bad.

2190
02:57:14,716 --> 02:57:30,092
[SPEAKER_22]: But when you turn, the base of the house is gonna be bigger than the upstairs, then you have to put in new, totally new boilers, totally new infrastructure, and who's gonna be responsible to shovel the driveway in the winter?

2191
02:57:30,932 --> 02:57:32,114
[SPEAKER_22]: If you look at that property,

2192
02:57:32,975 --> 02:57:34,496
[SPEAKER_22]: They're going to the back of the house.

2193
02:57:34,916 --> 02:57:36,617
[SPEAKER_22]: They could have arguments over who's going to shovel.

2194
02:57:37,318 --> 02:57:41,220
[SPEAKER_22]: They could have arguments over paying the insurance bill, the insurance bill.

2195
02:57:41,300 --> 02:57:42,581
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, sure.

2196
02:57:42,661 --> 02:57:42,961
[SPEAKER_22]: Go ahead.

2197
02:57:43,982 --> 02:57:45,163
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the major counseling.

2198
02:57:45,343 --> 02:57:57,030
[SPEAKER_14]: I do believe the majority of the issues that, um, the speaker is discussing would be outlined in the condo documents or the HOA documents that would be established when a multifamily house becomes condominiums and that gets filed with the registry of deeds.

2199
02:57:57,671 --> 02:57:57,991
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2200
02:57:58,031 --> 02:57:58,551
[SPEAKER_14]: Counselor.

2201
02:57:59,091 --> 02:57:59,492
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2202
02:57:59,632 --> 02:58:01,573
[SPEAKER_22]: And I do agree with that except for one thing.

2203
02:58:02,037 --> 02:58:14,065
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're dealing with just two people or two entities and one doesn't pay their side of the bill, that insurance policy gets canceled if the other person doesn't pay for it.

2204
02:58:14,505 --> 02:58:18,127
[SPEAKER_22]: So these are conflicts that you're bringing on for no good reason.

2205
02:58:18,147 --> 02:58:25,372
[SPEAKER_22]: You do not have to, and I thank you for your point, but you do not have to do this.

2206
02:58:25,472 --> 02:58:27,534
[SPEAKER_22]: This is optional.

2207
02:58:27,794 --> 02:58:31,236
[SPEAKER_22]: This is unlike my house where it changed from a family

2208
02:58:32,545 --> 02:58:36,086
[SPEAKER_22]: situation where I had my aunt downstairs, and everybody was relational.

2209
02:58:36,446 --> 02:58:38,647
[SPEAKER_22]: We didn't have a contract growing up.

2210
02:58:39,047 --> 02:58:40,027
[SPEAKER_22]: There was no contract.

2211
02:58:40,568 --> 02:58:41,928
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I had to rent it out.

2212
02:58:44,029 --> 02:58:47,850
[SPEAKER_22]: It's something that I had to do in order to survive, right?

2213
02:58:48,210 --> 02:58:55,772
[SPEAKER_22]: But this is an option to turn a single-family house with a mother-in-law or father-in-law apartment into a two-family or a two-condo.

2214
02:58:56,267 --> 02:58:58,689
[SPEAKER_22]: because now you're adding more stress to the family.

2215
02:58:59,489 --> 02:59:03,973
[SPEAKER_22]: That doesn't have to happen, but it's just because the developer wants to make more money.

2216
02:59:04,493 --> 02:59:11,618
[SPEAKER_22]: This is a money incentive for somebody living outside the city, and it's completely unnecessary to have to do it this way.

2217
02:59:11,918 --> 02:59:19,644
[SPEAKER_22]: It's great for the developer, they make money, but then the conflicts that can happen between these two condos when you do it with a two-family house too.

2218
02:59:19,664 --> 02:59:23,947
[SPEAKER_22]: It doesn't matter if it's a single family with a mother-in-law or a two-family house, when you do this,

2219
02:59:24,558 --> 02:59:29,963
[SPEAKER_22]: If one partner doesn't keep up their grass, you're on top of that person.

2220
02:59:30,243 --> 02:59:34,746
[SPEAKER_22]: It's bad enough when they're next door and there's 10 or 12 feet between the property lines.

2221
02:59:35,127 --> 02:59:38,970
[SPEAKER_22]: Now you're literally living up and down, and you're thumping.

2222
02:59:39,671 --> 02:59:41,732
[SPEAKER_22]: There's no hierarchy of authority.

2223
02:59:42,253 --> 02:59:51,440
[SPEAKER_22]: And it would bury you in legal costs if you're one person up against the other person, and they both have legal standing in the same way.

2224
02:59:51,881 --> 02:59:53,542
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a 22-page contract.

2225
02:59:54,067 --> 02:59:56,008
[SPEAKER_22]: with my tenant to protect me.

2226
02:59:56,348 --> 03:00:00,749
[SPEAKER_22]: And unlike when I was growing up, I didn't have to worry about putting everything in writing.

2227
03:00:00,989 --> 03:00:02,389
[SPEAKER_22]: Today you have to put everything in writing.

2228
03:00:02,929 --> 03:00:04,290
[SPEAKER_22]: Unfortunately, that's just the way it is.

2229
03:00:04,590 --> 03:00:07,310
[SPEAKER_22]: And the feel of the house is different than when it was relatives.

2230
03:00:07,831 --> 03:00:11,952
[SPEAKER_22]: I used to go into my aunt's kitchen and right into the fridge and grab a popsicle.

2231
03:00:12,572 --> 03:00:13,532
[SPEAKER_22]: That feel is gone.

2232
03:00:13,979 --> 03:00:15,860
[SPEAKER_22]: And that is a loss to me, you know?

2233
03:00:16,300 --> 03:00:20,602
[SPEAKER_22]: So, but it's unnecessary growth or whatever you want to call it.

2234
03:00:20,642 --> 03:00:22,543
[SPEAKER_22]: Sell it as a single family house.

2235
03:00:22,623 --> 03:00:23,424
[SPEAKER_22]: There's no problem.

2236
03:00:23,604 --> 03:00:24,844
[SPEAKER_22]: You just don't make as much profit.

2237
03:00:25,225 --> 03:00:25,885
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the difference.

2238
03:00:25,925 --> 03:00:26,245
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

2239
03:00:27,165 --> 03:00:27,626
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2240
03:00:28,586 --> 03:00:31,147
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion by Councilor Knight to receive in place on file.

2241
03:00:31,588 --> 03:00:36,850
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I feel as though the market controls what it is that developers are seeking to do.

2242
03:00:37,030 --> 03:00:41,152
[SPEAKER_14]: And as we see the baby boomer generation reach a certain age right now, they're looking to downsize.

2243
03:00:41,172 --> 03:00:42,473
[SPEAKER_14]: There is a demand for condominiums.

2244
03:00:42,883 --> 03:00:43,443
[SPEAKER_14]: in our city.

2245
03:00:43,544 --> 03:00:51,650
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why in the past I've brought forward requests to work with the city assessor to discuss condo conversion and whether or not we need a bylaw to address that.

2246
03:00:52,230 --> 03:00:56,974
[SPEAKER_14]: But I feel as though the market controls exactly what it is that would happen in development.

2247
03:00:57,054 --> 03:01:04,920
[SPEAKER_14]: And right now there is a push towards condominium living, and I believe it's attributable to the fact that the baby boomer generation is reaching an age where they're seeking downsize.

2248
03:01:06,181 --> 03:01:07,482
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to receive and place on file.

2249
03:01:07,962 --> 03:01:09,364
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

2250
03:01:09,404 --> 03:01:10,024
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

2251
03:01:11,645 --> 03:01:12,386
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

2252
03:01:13,055 --> 03:01:25,980
[SPEAKER_13]: Reports of Committee 17382, Subcommittee on Environmental Affairs Committee report regarding municipal aggregation from May 9th, 2017 subcommittee meeting.

2253
03:01:26,480 --> 03:01:38,004
[SPEAKER_13]: The subcommittee met on May 9th with several residents in attendance along with counselors to discuss municipal aggregation.

2254
03:01:40,802 --> 03:01:49,866
[SPEAKER_13]: The recommendation of the committee was to send the paper to the Committee of Whole for discussion with the whole body of councillors.

2255
03:01:52,687 --> 03:01:54,948
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to accept that paper.

2256
03:01:55,508 --> 03:01:56,329
[SPEAKER_13]: Question, Mr. President.

2257
03:01:56,949 --> 03:01:57,669
[SPEAKER_14]: Councillor Knight.

2258
03:01:57,909 --> 03:02:01,831
[SPEAKER_14]: I do believe that this paper has been before the Committee of the Whole on two previous occasions.

2259
03:02:01,851 --> 03:02:02,431
[SPEAKER_13]: You are correct.

2260
03:02:02,671 --> 03:02:05,193
[SPEAKER_14]: Sent to subcommittee for recommendations on how to move forward.

2261
03:02:05,213 --> 03:02:08,194
[SPEAKER_14]: Are there any recommendations that are coming out of the subcommittee as to how they'd like to

2262
03:02:08,952 --> 03:02:10,733
[SPEAKER_14]: recommend the committee of the whole proceed.

2263
03:02:10,793 --> 03:02:14,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a presentation of some sort that's going to be performed?

2264
03:02:14,355 --> 03:02:16,836
[SPEAKER_13]: There was no, uh, there was a presentation made that evening.

2265
03:02:16,856 --> 03:02:20,418
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and there was some discussion.

2266
03:02:20,438 --> 03:02:23,219
[SPEAKER_13]: I think counselor Marks, you can speak to that.

2267
03:02:23,259 --> 03:02:24,880
[SPEAKER_13]: You are the chairman of that subcommittee.

2268
03:02:26,161 --> 03:02:36,428
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, that meeting was set up at a request at the Committee of the Whole by Councilor Dela Russo to have further dialogue, and that's exactly what took place.

2269
03:02:37,228 --> 03:02:40,410
[SPEAKER_09]: We invited Alicia Hunt from the Energy and Environment Committee.

2270
03:02:41,051 --> 03:02:53,679
[SPEAKER_09]: We also invited Curtis Tooden, who is the committee chairman of Energy Environment Commission, and he gave a thorough explanation on green initiatives that

2271
03:02:54,344 --> 03:02:57,985
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, we as a council could do because it's based on city ordinance.

2272
03:02:58,785 --> 03:03:07,748
[SPEAKER_09]: And he also gave a presentation on the need for municipal aggregation in this community, which I think we all heard already.

2273
03:03:08,228 --> 03:03:12,069
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm not sure if there's anything new to add to the dialogue and discussion.

2274
03:03:12,089 --> 03:03:14,570
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, we did do our due diligence as a committee.

2275
03:03:14,870 --> 03:03:20,352
[SPEAKER_09]: We met, we listened to residents input and we decided that ultimately it'll be a vote of this council.

2276
03:03:21,172 --> 03:03:23,733
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, there was one caveat that was mentioned.

2277
03:03:25,563 --> 03:03:27,844
[SPEAKER_09]: City Solicitor Mark Rumley was present at the meeting.

2278
03:03:28,664 --> 03:03:46,031
[SPEAKER_09]: He was asked by myself to reach out to House Council, which is before the state legislature, and ask whether or not we as a city can file a home rule petition to actually craft the current state law a little differently.

2279
03:03:46,572 --> 03:03:54,075
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, if we were to vote on this municipal aggregation, everyone by default would be opted into the program.

2280
03:03:54,546 --> 03:03:58,429
[SPEAKER_09]: So residents don't have a say, everyone's opted in by default.

2281
03:03:58,909 --> 03:04:03,273
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you have an opt out clause that you can do to get out of the program if you'd like.

2282
03:04:04,053 --> 03:04:21,446
[SPEAKER_09]: My request to the city solicitor was to see if we can reverse that and have it be an opt in clause where if people are interested in joining municipal aggregation, that the city move forward and we set up a pool of people that are interested in going into municipal aggregation.

2283
03:04:22,067 --> 03:04:23,488
[SPEAKER_09]: And according to the city solicitor,

2284
03:04:23,892 --> 03:04:34,617
[SPEAKER_09]: with home rule petitions, the state legislature doesn't like to alter a law in a way that takes from the original intent.

2285
03:04:35,337 --> 03:04:42,400
[SPEAKER_09]: And he felt that by doing the opt-in was not doing away with the original intent, and so did House Council.

2286
03:04:42,460 --> 03:04:53,225
[SPEAKER_09]: So he said that could be an option if we as a body, and that's one of the things that was presented that night, wanted to have the paper sent to the mayor saying

2287
03:04:53,848 --> 03:05:04,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Madam Mayor, because the paper has to originate, has been passed practice by the mayor to offer a home rule petition with an opt-in clause.

2288
03:05:05,090 --> 03:05:06,530
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's where it stands, Mr. President.

2289
03:05:06,550 --> 03:05:07,850
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we're all aware of the issue.

2290
03:05:08,491 --> 03:05:13,191
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think there's any magic smoke and gun that's going to come out of any particular subcommittee meeting.

2291
03:05:14,152 --> 03:05:14,792
[SPEAKER_09]: It is what it is.

2292
03:05:16,472 --> 03:05:22,153
[SPEAKER_09]: And if people don't know what it is, then members of the council should ask questions to Alicia Hunt or

2293
03:05:23,118 --> 03:05:27,942
[SPEAKER_09]: through the Mass Municipal Association or even surrounding communities that are moving forward on it.

2294
03:05:28,823 --> 03:05:29,683
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you Mr. Vice President.

2295
03:05:30,344 --> 03:05:35,368
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion by Councillor Knight that we accept the paper, seconded by Councillor Falco.

2296
03:05:35,768 --> 03:05:36,588
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favour?

2297
03:05:36,609 --> 03:05:37,309
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

2298
03:05:37,329 --> 03:05:38,110
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

2299
03:05:38,810 --> 03:05:45,295
[SPEAKER_13]: The records were passed to Councillor DelaRose who has gone home ill.

2300
03:05:46,676 --> 03:05:49,018
[SPEAKER_13]: So I ask that they be tabled until next week.

2301
03:05:50,132 --> 03:05:53,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to adjourn by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli.

2302
03:05:53,957 --> 03:05:54,538
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

2303
03:24:32,020 --> 03:24:32,103
[SPEAKER_19]: you

2304
03:25:11,913 --> 03:25:11,975
[SPEAKER_19]: you
