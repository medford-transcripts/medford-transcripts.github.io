    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=140.854s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=142.074s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=143.095s">Councilor</a>  Falco? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=144.075s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=144.856s">Councilor</a>  Knight? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=145.556s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=146.397s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehnan? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=146.937s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=148.138s">Vice</a>  President Marks? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=149.458s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=150.199s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=151.259s">Present.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=152.06s">President</a>  Caraviello? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=153.36s">Present.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=154.641s">Please</a>  rise and salute the flag. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=172.73s">17-419</a>  offered by Vice President Michael Mox, accommodation for Mae Marbrek, 25 years of recognition as founder and member of the Friends of Chevalier and Jean Mack Gym. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=188.192s">Vice</a>  President Mox.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=213.506s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=214.307s">It's</a>  an honor and a pleasure to represent this council accommodation to <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=221.367s">what</a>  I refer to as a dear friend of mine for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=225.189s">Um,</a>  I met may probably back some, and I don't want to date you may, uh, back some 25 years ago, um, through different city organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=235.574s">And,</a>  um, I think it's only appropriate after all these years and all the different organizations that may as belong to, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=243.158s">that</a>  she received the recognition, not that she'd want, because May, if you know May, May never looks for recognition. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=250.805s">May's</a>  always behind the scenes, she's the engine driving what goes on in this community, and never once looked for any type of praise or accolades. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=260.212s">And</a>  even tonight, I wanna thank Council President Caraviello for making the phone call to say, hey May, can you come down to Tuesday's meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=267.979s">Multiple</a>  phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=268.92s">Multiple</a>  phone calls. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=271.195s">Can</a>  you come down to Tuesday's meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=273.056s">And</a>  I think May may have had an idea or not, I'm not quite sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=277.219s">But</a>  needless to say, I would at this point, I'd like to recognize, I served the last few years on the board of directors of the Friends of Chevalier and GMAC Gymnasium, alongside May and a number of other real activists in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=294.812s">And</a>  at this point, I would just like to recognize the board in which we sat on <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=300.747s">Cindy</a>  Watson, Co-President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=303.269s">Mike</a>  Cerullo, Co-President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=305.911s">Keith</a>  Barry, Member of the Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=308.754s">Representative</a>  Paul Donato, Member of the Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=311.056s">Susan</a>  Fairchild, Member of the Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=313.538s">Ken</a>  Kraus, Member of the Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=315.78s">May</a>  Makibrek, Member of the Board. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=318.282s">And</a>  Russ Rossetti, Member of the Friends of Chevalier Board of Directors. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=322.825s">You</a>  know, May, little known fact, was a Mustang Hall of Famer. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=329.4s">Back</a>  some years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=330.761s">Right,</a>  May? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=331.882s">Where</a>  is May? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=332.562s">May,</a>  where are you? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=333.443s">You're</a>  up over here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=335.805s">Mustang</a>  Hall of Famer. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=338.527s">May</a>  was the founding member of the Friends of Chevalier and Gene Mack Gymnasium. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=343.851s">Caché.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=345.132s">It</a>  was the brainchild of May, meeting with a few people in the community regarding the arts, that put together Caché, the Coalition for Art, Culture, and Healthy Economy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=356.6s">And,</a>  you know, May won't say it, but <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=359.438s">Those</a>  were May's ideas originally back many, many years ago to put organizations together, to link the community up, and pull in all different backgrounds in order to move this community forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=373.407s">While</a>  promoting the arts is a main goal of CACHE, it also aims to bolster the local economy at the same time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=382.794s">Looking</a>  ahead, we are hoping to create a more vibrant arts and cultural scene in Method, which in turn <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=389.374s">will</a>  promote economic development, May Makibrek said. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=393.417s">That</a>  part of it cannot be overlooked, and it is what we feel sets the group apart. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=399.921s">We</a>  all work together as equals, with one big exception, John Anderson said. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=405.464s">May</a>  Makibrek is really the driving force, and she has been so enthusiastic and youthful and full of ideas. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=412.589s">You</a>  need a person like that if a coalition such as this has any chance of surviving, which it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=419.238s">a</a>  good sign for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=422.94s">May</a>  served as the president of Springstep. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=426.061s">She</a>  also served on the board of directors for Brooks Estates Land Trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=433.245s">May</a>  was recognized by the Chamber of Commerce as Citizen of the Year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=438.683s">Who</a>  can forget May's article, which appeared in the March 14, 2014 edition of the Method transcript, honoring Method Olympic champion Mary Carew Armstrong for National Women's History Month, or the countless letters to the editor in which May offered support to local organizations. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=462.23s">As</a>  we all know, May was part of a lot of different civic groups, but she was also very vocal on the issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=468.612s">And</a>  May, she wasn't a wallflower. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=472.315s">She</a>  let it be known. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=474.176s">She</a>  let it be known where she stood in an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=477.038s">And</a>  if there was an issue that was confronting the residents of this community, you better believe May was at that podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=485.044s">I</a>  remember the night the Medford Public Library was experiencing roof leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=489.907s">And</a>  guess who was at the podium? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=492.852s">We</a>  have very, very dedicated people who are here tonight, members of the staff of the library, just hoping that the ceiling tiles in the building that they're working wouldn't fall in on their head, said May Makibrek, president of the Method Coalition for the Arts, at the council meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=510.643s">This</a>  is disgraceful. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=514.026s">We</a>  often remember the debate with art funding in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=518.268s">The</a>  city never funded arts in the budget, and a few years ago, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=521.553s">this</a>  council offered a resolution to put arts in the budget, and May was at the podium once again. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=527.437s">I</a>  think it's fair to say we're in an arts revolution, said May Makibrek. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=531.78s">Medford</a>  has changed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=533.121s">We</a>  are no longer a streetcar suburb. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=535.623s">We're</a>  a vibrant community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=537.384s">We</a>  have a great deal to offer, and there is an arts movement going on at the present time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=545.528s">Several</a>  years back, we had the Brooks Estates bond proposal that was before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=549.971s">Quite</a>  a contentious issue for some. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=553.114s">May,</a>  again, was at the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=555.476s">The</a>  Brooks Estates has been treated by the city like an orphan, said Medford resident, May Marky-Brick. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=563.401s">In</a>  2010, community leaders were pushing to build up the Chevalier Theater. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=568.978s">May</a>  stated, now that the problem is not so much the condition of the theater, which like any property requires ongoing maintenance, but the underutilization of the Chevalier Theater, she said, how much longer are we going to talk, continue to see a valuable asset in our community be underutilized, and waste the opportunity to have Chevalier Theater become an engine of economic development in Medford Square? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=595.283s">These</a>  are just a few of the things that I recall May working on over the years as a community activist, as someone who wholeheartedly cared about the children of this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=609.828s">You</a>  couldn't find anyone more responsive to the needs of the Boys and Girls Club, which is on Forest Street, than May. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=618.45s">The</a>  arts movement, I think, May was the art movement for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=627.597s">And</a>  it's only appropriate tonight that we take the time to, and I see this audience is filled, it's not many times that this audience gets filled, and it's my distinct honor and pleasure to thank my friend, May Makibrek, for her many years of dedicated service, and I know some members of the council wanna speak. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=651.777s">I'd</a>  just like to read the citation, and May, we have a few more speeches, if you don't mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=657.143s">There's</a>  a nice comfy seat next to you if you want to sit down. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=659.545s">It</a>  says the Medford City Council takes pleasure in awarding this council accommodation to May Makibrek in recognition of her 25 years of distinguished service as founder and member of the Friends of Chevalier Auditorium and GMAC Gymnasium, signed May 16th by Council President Richard Caraviello and Vice President Michael J. Mox.</p>

    <p>[May Marquebreuck]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=714.102s">Thank</a>  you, uh, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=715.963s">Uh,</a>  I'm just gonna, uh, do a little, uh, word checking and make sure that I did say all those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=726.007s">Uh,</a>  well, this is a very, uh, special moment, and I appreciate all of you have come here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=735.631s">When,</a>  uh, President Caraviello called me about coming here tonight, I thought he was gonna ask me to be on a subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=746.124s">And</a>  I was going to have to say, I'm sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=751.747s">At</a>  any rate, in accepting this very, very wonderful tribute, I also have to give a lot of credit to all of the people who have been working on the Friends of Chevalier for the past 25 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=775.497s">those</a>  past and those present, some of which are here in the chamber tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=782.681s">And,</a>  uh, and thinking back about that early time, uh, I would just like to remember a few of our dear friends who are probably looking down on us this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=798.889s">And</a>  that would be a Teresa Cerullo, wife of Michael Cerullo, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=805.917s">and</a>  John Nostry, and there may be others that I hope I haven't overlooked, Dick Oba, who were very, very much a part of the early days when we established the Friends of Chevalier. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=829.925s">And</a>  over the years, the group has worked very diligently <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=835.704s">and</a>  very quietly, but has accomplished a great deal. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=840.285s">In</a>  fact, in addition to being advocates for the theater and the Boys and Girls Club for these many years, they also raised a considerable amount of money. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=853.189s">And</a>  believe it or not, that would be more than $350,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=869.66s">One</a>  of the major grants that was given to the friends was from the Cummings Foundation, which is a local philanthropic organization by Bill Cummings and his wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=894.607s">As</a>  you know, the property here are joining us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=898.775s">is</a>  owned by the Cummings people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=901.396s">So</a>  they gave $100,000 to add staff to the Boys and Girls Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=911.301s">And</a>  I have to say that I'm very, very proud that the friends were a big part of the Boys and Girls Club coming here to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=922.566s">Uh,</a>  they have been extremely successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=926.288s">The,</a>  uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=927.588s">they</a>  still have a waiting list in spite of the additional money that they receive from the Cummings people to add instructional staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=938.592s">So</a>  we have been quietly working away over the years and I just hope that those of you at some time may consider giving a small contribution because it's always very, very welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=956.038s">And</a>  I want to, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=958.392s">recognize,</a>  as Council Marks did, the current members on the board, and to wish you good luck going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=970.805s">Thank</a>  you all very much.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=987.897s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=989.178s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=991.559s">I</a>  don't want to put you on the spot any longer, Mae, but I think a few of us just want to say a few words. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=995.942s">We've</a>  been in and Council Marks did a great job announcing you and taking quotes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=1001.746s">That</a>  was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=1002.987s">But</a>  just from my standpoint, you've been a true leader in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=1007.41s">You've</a>  done such wonderful things that have <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=1009.796s">So</a>  many people have benefited from, families and every resident in this community has benefited from your work with the Chevalier and Cachet and everything else you were involved in and the fact that you did it because you love this city and you wanted to make it better means a lot and I look up to you May and I wish you the best and good luck in your retirement. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=1028.556s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2041.614s">It's</a>  a challenge, but I'll try to be brief. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2044.017s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2045.278s">Tonight's</a>  actually an interesting night. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2046.679s">It's</a>  the 43rd program year of the Community Development Block Grant, and I'm actually before you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2051.848s">With</a>  an estimated allocation, we are estimating that we will receive the money that we have received last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2056.833s">But</a>  this year, for the first time, after 43 years of the CDBG program, we don't have our allocation from the federal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2063.599s">As</a>  you all know, the debates that have been going on in it, which I won't go into detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2067.083s">So</a>  we've been instructed by the area HUD office to prepare our budgets and move ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2071.387s">And</a>  then have a phrase in our application, which we have in the notice that we gave to the city clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2077.043s">that</a>  basically says we will proportionately increase or decrease this budget based on what the actual allocation amounts are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2083.685s">We</a>  expect that we should get them by the end of the June and then they'll move very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2087.786s">They</a>  have to be submitted to HUD so that they can meet their statutory requirements for review. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2092.788s">So,</a>  uh, sorry, there we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2100.55s">Uh,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2101.586s">housing</a>  activities, physical improvements to public systems and city systems, economic development, public services, planning and administration, and program income. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2112.592s">And</a>  those budgets will also include public services. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2116.174s">We</a>  have funded here in this program about 14 public service agencies for a total of $210,586. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2121.556s">And</a>  if they're listening tonight, they should remember that caveat I just said. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2126.939s">It's</a>  contingent on receipt of the federal funds. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2129.403s">from</a>  the Community Development Block Grant Program. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2131.083s">Everybody's</a>  support to their Congress people and to the President about continuing this program is appreciated, and we've appreciated all of the support of the City Council to accomplish many great activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2142.086s">If</a>  you'd like, I can respond to specific questions if you would like to keep this portion of the hearing short. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2146.567s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2147.247s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2148.147s">Mr.</a>  President, year after year, we have meetings with representatives and delegations from various public service organizations and non-profits who do business in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2159.126s">and</a>  who benefit from these grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2162.207s">The</a>  Office of Community Development goes through great lengths to accommodate and to disperse these funds in a kind manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2171.61s">And</a>  a great sense of concern is put into this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2176.532s">So</a>  in that light, and I must lament the possibility of diminishment of these fundings, but I move approval to the plan that's been presented to us.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2188.056s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2189.157s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2190.217s">Mr.</a>  President, I too support the plan that's been presented to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2192.778s">The</a>  office of community development doesn't, has done an excellent job since my election to the council and explaining where these funds go. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2198.519s">All</a>  the applicants come before the council at a committee of the whole meeting and pitch their case to, um, request this funding as to why it would be good for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2206.841s">Um,</a>  provided that, um, there's nobody here in opposition, Mr. President, I'd move that we close the public hearing.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2213.442s">Councilor</a>  Marks, vice president marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2215.923s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2217.523s">Lauren,</a>  are the human service groups made aware of what is happening?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2223.047s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2223.187s">Do</a>  we send a letter? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2224.547s">How</a>  are they made aware?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2226.148s">We've</a>  actually had a meeting with them before. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2228.27s">We</a>  met with a committee, the whole of the city council had a meeting that we do with the senior center every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2233.593s">They're</a>  all invited. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2234.413s">They're</a>  told in that meeting notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2236.214s">Most</a>  of them come. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2237.035s">They're</a>  really supposed to all come. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2238.316s">A</a>  couple don't come, but they've all been told. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2240.824s">about</a>  what the status of it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2242.945s">And</a>  a lot of them actually have this similar problem where there are other funding sources. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2246.146s">So,</a>  yes, they all know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2248.027s">When</a>  we will be waiting for the allocation, we won't make any announcements and there won't be any contracts executed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2253.35s">We</a>  can't do that until HUD actually gives us the allocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2256.231s">We</a>  submit our plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2257.251s">It's</a>  approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2258.832s">And,</a>  you know, it's probably likely that money, if they move things along the way they're talking, would probably be available, I'm going to guess, sometime in August or late September. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2268.563s">they'll</a>  know we keep them informed and I think they all pretty much know they're suffering the similar problems with other funding sources as I said.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2275.565s">So</a>  as any group mentioned that because of maybe staff hiring or other employee issues that there may be a concern if they don't get the funding from day one?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2286.668s">They</a>  have not raised those issues to us.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2288.488s">There's</a>  been no issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2290.128s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2291.769s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Curran. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2293.009s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2295.75s">Thank</a>  you for coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2298.371s">with</a>  regards to the allocation portion of it, nobody's going to be cut out? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2301.973s">Is</a>  it just going to be if we receive 10% less?</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2304.755s">How</a>  would it be broken down? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2306.917s">So</a>  the maximum we can fund is 15% of the total allocation. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2310.459s">And</a>  the table you see there, and I want to clarify a couple of things for you on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2314.42s">The</a>  table you see there allocating $210,000 is if we get level funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2318.703s">So</a>  the way I'm proposing is that we would increase these agencies up to a maximum of 15% if the allocation increases, and decrease them proportionally if the allocation is cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2328.251s">There</a>  are two things, two changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2329.572s">The</a>  Medford Housing Authority did not receive money last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2332.375s">They</a>  applied for money, about $8,000 to hire, or actually pay a stipend to someone to provide language translation services at the walking court development for people who are Haitian. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2344.308s">And</a>  honestly, in order for us to fund the number one, we don't know if we're going to get the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2348.65s">Number</a>  two, we'd have to cut our other agency by that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2350.871s">So</a>  to give them a token amount we didn't think would really be beneficial, and we'd have to cut another agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2356.074s">And</a>  a couple of these agencies are receiving under a couple of thousand dollars. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2359.676s">Salvation</a>  Army is an agency that did apply. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2362.017s">Last</a>  year, Salvation Army was the agency with all the resources that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2366.533s">you</a>  know, you know, under a couple of thousand dollars that they get from us, they returned back money last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2371.335s">They're</a>  very stringent. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2373.576s">How</a>  do I want to say, um, intentions about the person that we deal with intentions about how they want to distribute the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2381.258s">And</a>  so again, we've already heard that they may not spend the money and this is very emergency assistance money. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2385.68s">So</a>  we, uh, made a recommendation to the mayor, which she agreed was to allocate that to another agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2391.522s">And</a>  you will see that we have, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2394.353s">suggested</a>  that the community family which provides Alzheimer's assistance and subsidizes the tuition or the fees for a Medford resident or more than one resident if there's money available, they receive $1,745. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2407.696s">We've</a>  recommended they go up to $2,907. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2410.937s">And</a>  then we'll, you know, as we can, if we can, poke down to get some of these other agencies that are under a couple thousand dollars up in the future that we hope to try to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2421.08s">So</a>  that's what we did. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2423.22s">Mayor</a>  for housing authority, which never has not received money into public services. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2427.823s">And</a>  then salvation army was eliminated on the fact that they did not spend their money last year and are not on target to spend it again this year.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2435.389s">Gotcha.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2435.709s">So</a>  that explains why the two aren't in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2437.991s">And</a>  then if we did get 15% more, these one to 10, 15, um, agencies will get 15% more across the board.</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2448.138s">If</a>  it was 15, it would be 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2448.859s">If</a>  it was 10, 10% cut, they'd be 10% cut. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2452.123s">what</a>  I'm getting at is none will get changed dramatically depending. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2455.365s">It</a>  depends. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2456.245s">It</a>  depends on, we could get no funding and then they will get nothing and we will get nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2461.448s">So,</a>  but I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm trust. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2463.83s">Well,</a>  we have to trust still in the system of government that we have and that that won't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2468.672s">Um,</a>  so yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2470.353s">So</a>  that's why we do support everybody basically letting know their elected officials know the importance of this program and advocating for it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2477.537s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2477.998s">And</a>  then my last question would just be just to give us a, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2481.152s">a</a>  brief summary, I mean, people at home should know a little bit of where this money's going, how much we have as a total, and where it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2488.635s">So</a>  if you could give us a brief summary, that would be helpful.</p>

    <p>[Laurel Siegel]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2490.555s">So</a>  the total amount of money that we're estimating, again, it's an estimate, is $1,403,210. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2496.638s">We're</a>  allocating, we're proposing $20,000 for housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2499.199s">We</a>  have some existing housing money, so that's not all the money that we have for housing resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2503.84s">We're</a>  also eligible to access money with non-profit agencies through the city's relationship with the North Suburban Consortium. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2511.542s">Economic</a>  development, $20,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2513.003s">As</a>  you see, we talked about the storefront program and economic development strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2517.286s">We</a>  still have some money from this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2518.727s">We</a>  have not implemented that storefront program. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2520.629s">So</a>  we have money from this year, and we'd have money going forward if this is funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2525.612s">Public</a>  services, you cannot carry money over from one year to the next on public services. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2530.536s">So</a>  that $210,000 would be the max, and that's contingent on that allocation number that I told you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2536.2s">And</a>  those go to a variety of agencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2540.228s">people</a>  working with after-school programs to English language classes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2546.872s">The</a>  senior center here in Medford receives a good portion of the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2552.196s">SCM</a>  Community Transportation is an agency that also is well-funded. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2555.898s">We</a>  have an agency that provides housing counseling services. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2560.321s">Actually,</a>  I shouldn't use housing counseling services anymore because HUD has now defined that strictly, but housing referral agencies and advocacy and protection for people who are going through <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2569.384s">evictions</a>  and things like that, representation in court. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2572.146s">So,</a>  and we also have funding that goes to EMARC and I think the, not I think, I know, the Boys and Girls Club. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2581.014s">So</a>  those are generally the kind of services, they're a wide range of very important services that assist Medford's low and moderate income populations. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2588.46s">And</a>  planning and admin, admin goes for any kind of study that's related to the CDBG program. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2593.004s">It</a>  might be fair housing if that's what happens, so we help pay toward the city's <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2596.856s">single</a>  audit for the portion of our program. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2599.138s">It</a>  also funds the majority of the staff costs in our office and a portion of the diversity of director's office.</p>

    <p>[Rafael Batista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2800.3s">The</a>  first reason is going to be that we request to be two signs because of the large size of the building and directions of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2812.185s">whoever's</a>  coming into one side of the building, we're not going to be able to see the other side of the building, which the client has the top, the whole top corner of the entire building as his business. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2824.432s">And</a>  we required to be, we're being required by the inspector to be more darker. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2829.835s">So</a>  we put the box itself to be Brown's. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2832.636s">So</a>  we match with the building and the colors to be playing with the colors of our nation, which is red, white, and blue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2840.049s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2840.669s">And</a>  plain and simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2842.21s">And</a>  we also had an issue that we unfortunately made a mistake putting the lettering on the windows that without the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2850.613s">And</a>  then we've been fined. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2852.794s">We</a>  paid the fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2854.534s">And</a>  now the client agreed to remove the logos from the windows because we are going to be putting the signs up in approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=2862.895s">but</a>  he also wanted to request, if it's possible, there is a possibility to keep the lettering over the surface that he presents on the glasses, which is already on the copy that you guys probably have it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3010.499s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3012.34s">I</a>  think what we're seeing here tonight is based on the location of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3019.664s">So</a>  if you look at the picture that we have on the paper we received, the building is located partially on Forest Street, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3028.454s">and</a>  partially on high street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3030.736s">So</a>  for all intents of purposes, it's like this building has two fronting facades. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3036.16s">And</a>  I think that's what at least this petition is trying to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3040.503s">I</a>  don't agree with the illuminated signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3042.304s">And</a>  I think this council has been, uh, on record not supporting illuminated signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3047.908s">Uh,</a>  however, the, uh, the type of sign, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3051.575s">and</a>  the number of signs I have no problem with, uh, based on what I believe, uh, is the hardship of having your main entrance on high street and, uh, the rest of your building, uh, on forestry. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3065.902s">And</a>  that to me proposes a hardship. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3069.424s">And</a>  I think the additional signage is warranted in this particular case. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3074.046s">So</a>  I don't agree with my other colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3076.567s">Uh,</a>  the only thing I do agree with is the fact that, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3079.526s">I</a>  don't support the internally illuminated portion of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3084.007s">If</a>  it's the druthers of the council to send this to the sign committee, I have no problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3089.549s">I'm</a>  not quite sure what we're going to accomplish there that we couldn't accomplish right now with the party before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3095.79s">If</a>  there's recommendations, you know, if the party agrees upon them now, I don't see why we have to have a subcommittee meeting on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3105.113s">Those</a>  are my thoughts, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3107.114s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3108.015s">And,</a>  uh, as chairman of the business and economic development and science committee, uh, also, uh, with myself and councilor Scarpelli, uh, we'll, uh, once we, uh, finished with debate on this matter, we'll take the, the vote on the motion chair recognizes councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3126.826s">Um,</a>  if I can, if I know what the, the denial of the signs, I think that if you look at the rest of the square and keeping with the theme that we have right now, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3137.195s">If</a>  you look across the street, I don't disagree with Council Marks and the petitioner looking for the number of signs, but if you look at the way that Andre Realty did what they did across the street, they have multiple signs, but the way they addressed it, it fits the look of the square where it's not illuminated, and they added decorative lights around it that would light the sign, but at the same time, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3165.838s">keeps</a>  the same appeal and routine throughout our business community in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3175.786s">So</a>  I'm not a fan of the lit sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3182.532s">If</a>  you look across the other businesses in the square, I think you could see that it's tasteful. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3190.898s">And</a>  with the different forms of lighting, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3193.384s">I</a>  think you can accommodate what you're looking for to illuminate your sign with what the neighboring businesses have. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3200.189s">So</a>  I too will not support the illuminated sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3204.112s">I</a>  will entertain, you know, a few different signs location because it does wrap around so I can understand that need. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3213.118s">But</a>  again, I can't, I will not support the big illuminated signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3219.737s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3220.497s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Lungo-Curran.</p>

    <p>[Rafael Batista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3233.584s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3235.605s">We</a>  thought about it, but we thought that would be more complicated to get approval on that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3240.827s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, Nick, I am trying to hear out what my council colleagues are saying, and you did attach... Oh, actually, Wayside, which is the next petitioner, did attach <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3250.22s">signs</a>  from across the street, which are much more expensive signs and obviously very nice character for the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3256.982s">But</a>  I understand that not everybody can afford that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3259.443s">And</a>  at the same token, where these two businesses are, you do have awnings at the restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3266.205s">So</a>  maybe even that would help. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3268.105s">Something</a>  like that would be a little in-between resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3272.106s">And</a>  I'm not sure if it will help all my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3275.247s">But</a>  I just was curious if that was discussed at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3278.101s">That</a>  is a tough location to have a business. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3280.303s">The</a>  parking is tough. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3281.344s">So</a>  I do see the need for a sign on each street, forest and high. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3287.99s">So</a>  I agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3289.071s">So</a>  I think we're almost along the same lines, but whether or not you want to take it back and do a redesign to appease all the Councilors or get two signs with just with no illumination, I think it's kind of up to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3304.679s">because</a>  I do like what's across the street better, but at the same token, I understand that's probably much more pricey and there are awnings and different wall stickers on the building you're on. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3314.183s">So</a>  I mean, business has to do what they can afford, although it would be nice to have some conformity.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3323.568s">Thank</a>  you, Madam Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3325.009s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3326.669s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3327.91s">I'm</a>  reviewing the documents here and I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of the illuminated sign, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3335.035s">And</a>  when I look at the signs in the square, the other thing that I like, and we're trying to, I think in many ways, the community is trying to rebrand Method Square because we're trying to bring business in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3345.578s">And</a>  when I look at these signs at other businesses, everything seems to be very uniform. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3351.46s">It's</a>  all on the same level. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3353.581s">If</a>  I take a look at the sign, your sign, and then I take a look at Wayside, you know, Wayside <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3360.815s">seems</a>  to be in line with the rest of the businesses, and you're popping up in the air a bit, which just seems out of whack, kind of. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3369.398s">I</a>  mean, it doesn't seem that clean. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3372.739s">It</a>  just seems like it would be nice if you could kind of get everything in one uniform way. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3377.801s">But</a>  I will admit, I'm not a big fan of the illuminated signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3381.482s">Is</a>  there any flexibility on that?</p>

    <p>[Rafael Batista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3384.464s">I</a>  believe so. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3385.464s">I</a>  actually have a question right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3388.807s">What</a>  about, I'm just counting here, looks like we have six sets of windows up in his office. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3395.349s">Would</a>  it be allowed, do you guys, would it allow if we present to the client to be awnings instead?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3400.871s">I'm</a>  sorry, you want to put awnings in the place of the site?</p>

    <p>[Rafael Batista]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3409.954s">Awnings</a>  on top of each window. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3412.714s">On</a>  top of the windows at the very top? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3414.815s">At</a>  the very top, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3416.476s">Perhaps</a>  we could do like red, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3418.507s">And</a>  then with the white, just white letters, global health care.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3423.088s">I'm</a>  wondering if that needs to be, uh, discussed it with your client and, uh, uh, perhaps the property owner, uh, to the point of information council night.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3433.671s">Um,</a>  when I raised the issue of referring it to the subcommittee, my intention was to do so so that we could get both petitioners wayside and global health services together in the same room and they could make a joint presentation to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3444.354s">It</a>  looks like it would be something that would fit more. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3446.705s">within</a>  the quality and character of the neighborhood was the way that I was thinking that it was going to work out.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3450.626s">That's</a>  how I took your motion to be attended. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3455.747s">Councilor</a>  Falco, you still have the floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3458.288s">I'm</a>  all set. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3458.728s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3459.168s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3459.908s">So</a>  on the motion of Councilor Knight is seconded by Councilor Caraviello, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3465.33s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3466.47s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3467.39s">Councilor</a>  Marks?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3470.211s">Please</a>  record me in opposition to this, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3472.971s">I</a>  do not support the illuminated sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3475.963s">but</a>  I do support moving forward with the signage on both forest and high street because of the hardship the petitioner has.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3483.925s">Very</a>  good on that motion and recognizing, uh, Councilor Marks, uh, opposition, all those in favor, all those opposed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3491.667s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3495.788s">Uh,</a>  Councilor Knight, um, 17 four five one. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3499.409s">Um,</a>  it's going to, it's going to sound like the same exact conversation I think we just had.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3503.93s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3504.838s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight to take 17451 out of order. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3510.441s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3511.281s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3513.562s">17451,</a>  petition for signed denial reversal by Richard DiTullio, property manager for Wayside Youth and Family, 5 High Street, Medford, Mass. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3521.166s">OCD</a>  application 2017-11A exceeds allowable size, secondary sign, and window signage. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3531.008s">Is</a>  the petitioner present? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3532.409s">If</a>  you are, please present yourself to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3534.631s">State</a>  your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[Richard Ditullio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3539.054s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3539.494s">My</a>  name's Richard Detulio, property manager with Wayside Youth. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3544.178s">I'm</a>  here with the owner of the sign company, Rachel O'Donoghue.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3548.521s">How</a>  do you do?</p>

    <p>[Richard Ditullio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3549.081s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3550.482s">First,</a>  I just want to be clear that this gentleman's property is on the second floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3557.627s">We're</a>  aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3559.217s">Okay,</a>  so is he looking to put a sign adjacent to ours on the ground floor? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3563.34s">He</a>  is.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3565.001s">Isn't</a>  this space for the first floor tenant?</p>

    <p>[Buu0dDHgsRo_SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3585.921s">No</a>  wonder they said no, because we're asking to put the sign in that panel.</p>

    <p>[Richard Ditullio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3589.284s">Yeah,</a>  you can see we have a kind of a collision there of signs.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3593.447s">It</a>  would seem, and I think the sentiments of the council with us, with the approval of that previous motion, that the wise thing to do would be to meet in committee to where <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3606.998s">The</a>  proceedings can be a little more conversational, that charts and designs can be exchanged, an assessment of what the ordinances are can also be substantiated by the OCD director or the building inspector, and I think we can come to some conclusions in that forum. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3632.277s">But</a>  you have the floor, so if you would present your matter to us.</p>

    <p>[Richard Ditullio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3637.498s">Well,</a>  what we had hoped to do was on the ground floor, we had planned on putting two signs above the windows. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3647.361s">One</a>  of the signs has been approved by the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3652.562s">That</a>  sign is in production. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3654.003s">It's</a>  a non-illuminated sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3656.805s">It's</a>  a white background, green lettering, with our company logo, if you will. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3664.37s">What</a>  we had wanted to do in our application was add a second sign, again, because of the wrap onto Forest Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3673.376s">In</a>  addition to that, we wanted to put three signs in the window itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3680.88s">The</a>  addition of the sign that the tenant up on the second floor has is a surprise. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3685.881s">And</a>  again, we can understand why it looks very busy with signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3692.583s">So</a>  we're a not-for-profit. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3696.104s">We've</a>  been around for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3697.504s">We</a>  hope to do well in the Medford area.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3703.828s">And,</a>  and the council understands for both entities, the importance of, uh, having signs, uh, on a place of, uh, business. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3712.174s">Uh,</a>  so, uh, we're aware of that and, uh, hope to expedite this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3717.658s">Uh,</a>  but, uh, the chair awaits motion committee on science, business and economic development on that motion. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3725.744s">Uh,</a>  chair recognizes, uh, president Caraviello second. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3729.567s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3730.128s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3730.688s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3732.43s">Mr.</a>  President, record me in opposition based on the fact that this business, as well as the prior business owner, has the same hardship being located at a very busy intersection on two major roads in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3746.841s">And</a>  the additional signage, in my opinion, is warranted, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3750.964s">And,</a>  you know, after discussing for many years how dark Method Square is, maybe we should start looking at internally illuminated signs to help out with <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3761.337s">the</a>  brightness in the square, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3763.738s">Um,</a>  and you know, maybe that's something that's needed in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3768.118s">So</a>  record me in opposition based on those facts.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3771.879s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3772.879s">Uh,</a>  and, uh, perhaps I might say from the chair that externally, uh, illuminated science might achieve the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3780.441s">So</a>  on the motion of council night, seconded by a council Caraviello, uh, understanding that, uh, Councilor Marks wishes to be marked in opposition chair recognizes vice president, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3790.403s">Councilor.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3793.005s">I</a>  also want to be recorded in opposition with regards to the two signs for the front of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3798.648s">I</a>  think that's, like I said in the last petition, I think that's necessary for this location. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3803.732s">So</a>  I just want to be recorded in opposition for those two signs.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3807.774s">Very</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3808.855s">On</a>  the motion.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3810.556s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3812.737s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3813.358s">I</a>  think the, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3815.002s">the</a>  biggest confusion right now is the muddy water. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3817.704s">Now</a>  with the other look, the other issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3819.785s">So</a>  I don't, if you came to us with this being the only issue with two signs, I would support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3825.109s">But</a>  with the other signs, one going above it now in my mind to, to prove that and then possibly have that as an option later, I can't support it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3836.316s">So</a>  I, I, I, I would go with the subcommittee so we can talk this out and listen to the, um, you know, the, what the landlord has to say and then, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3845.667s">and</a>  find some other solutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3846.968s">But</a>  when the time comes, I definitely support the two signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3850.389s">I</a>  think that's gonna be needed.</p>

    <p>[Richard Ditullio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3852.189s">Typically</a>  though, wouldn't the second floor tenant be limited to his window space?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3857.551s">Again,</a>  we don't know for the fact that there's a landlord issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3860.532s">That's</a>  not with us.</p>

    <p>[Buu0dDHgsRo_SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3863.673s">I</a>  mean, you're probably paying the prime rate because you're on the first floor.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3870.515s">Obviously,</a>  there's a solution here and the councilors wanna get to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3875.435s">I'll</a>  say Councilor, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3876.575s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3877.936s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. Chairman. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3879.476s">I</a>  agree with my colleague, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3882.457s">I</a>  actually have no problem with the signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3884.118s">I</a>  actually like the signs and I think they're fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3886.759s">There</a>  is some confusion, though, if you look at these two pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3889.94s">All</a>  these signs are in the same spot.</p>

    <p>[Buu0dDHgsRo_SPEAKER_19]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3891.46s">I</a>  wasn't aware of that because they're renting the first floor, so I assumed that the facade belonged to the first floor tenant. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3899.563s">I</a>  didn't even know there was somebody else moving in there or that they were looking for signs.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3904.199s">But</a>  like I said, I have no problem with the signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3905.719s">I</a>  think the signs look fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3907.26s">They're</a>  very professional. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3908.42s">They're</a>  not illuminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3909.6s">They're</a>  nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3911.841s">I</a>  just think going to subcommittee, I think we'll hopefully resolve some issues, clear things up, and then come before us again.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3920.804s">Mr.</a>  Chair, we request a meeting relatively quick because I know the hardship here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3928.746s">So</a>  it wouldn't be something waiting weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3930.446s">I'd</a>  like to get this done as soon as possible if we can.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3935.018s">Uh,</a>  Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3935.938s">Move</a>  the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3937.098s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by President Carfiello. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3941.259s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3942.64s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3943.04s">All</a>  those opposed? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3947.1s">The</a>  ayes have it, with Councilors Lungelkern and Marks in opposition. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3952.402s">Councilor,</a>  President, uh, Carfiello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3956.282s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3957.143s">Mr.</a>  President, um, before we go on to the next thing, um, seeing that the gentleman before this, uh, had to pay a fine, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3964.897s">for</a>  a sign violation, I would hope that the code enforcement officer goes out into the square there, because I think there are many other sign violations in the square that he can take care of, and that gentleman shouldn't have been singled out previously when they say there are other violations, and I would hope the code enforcement officer would get out there and take care of the other violations that are in the other windows in the square.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3986.638s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=3987.559s">Uh,</a>  the, uh, council goes in record as a recommending with this motion, uh, that the, uh, code enforcement officer, uh, be alerted to other violations for signage in the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4000.448s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4001.388s">Uh,</a>  there will be a public notice of the meeting of the subcommittee, uh, posted on the city's website, uh, or through the clerk's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4009.554s">If</a>  you wish for them to be, um, uh, contact you, uh, to, to bring you in, uh, for that subcommittee meeting.</p>

    <p>[Richard Ditullio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4016.645s">When</a>  will that be posted?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4019.386s">As</a>  soon as the chairman arranges for the meeting.</p>

    <p>[Richard Ditullio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4022.488s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4023.108s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4024.308s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4024.728s">So</a>  we can check that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4026.369s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4026.609s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4027.33s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Ditullio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4027.55s">I</a>  appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4031.171s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4032.512s">Madam,</a>  we have one more sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4034.353s">Do</a>  you want to finish that last sign? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4041.215s">That's</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4042.116s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4042.336s">17,</a>  452 petition for signed denial reversal by pastor <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4045.47s">Exend</a>  your favor for Evangelical Haitian Church of Somerville, 400 High Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4051.413s">OCD</a>  number 201713. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4055.215s">Size</a>  exceed maximum size. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4057.857s">Name</a>  and address of the record, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4062.159s">Name</a>  and address of the record.</p>

    <p>[Exenor Fevrier]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4063.56s">Good</a>  evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4065.101s">Thank</a>  you very much for giving us an opportunity to address the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4070.283s">And</a>  I'm pastor of February, and I have <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4073.625s">I</a>  have with me my assistant, Flo, and she.</p>

    <p>[Flo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4078.409s">Okay,</a>  it's 400 High Street, Medford Mass, 02155. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4080.811s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4086.135s">The</a>  sign that you have there is, looks like it's bigger than the allowable amount allowed by the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4094.381s">If</a>  you see the picture here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4096.483s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4098.604s">I</a>  think there's a sign there on the property now, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4101.449s">which</a>  is, I think that's the law of the size. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4103.43s">Uh,</a>  Councilor Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4106.491s">Uh,</a>  Mr. President, I have no objection to this request to move approval on the motion by Councilor Dello Russo seconded by councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4126.637s">If</a>  I can, I, I, I just, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4129.448s">With</a>  the recent concerns that we've had in that area with traffic issues, I think would this sign be too big for public safety in the sense that for the traffic and deterring of drivers? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4148.391s">I</a>  think that that's one of the most dangerous areas we've heard in a long time on this council with that corner with <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4159.372s">and</a>  being such a encompassing sign, I question whether that might be a little too large and a little deterrent for the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4171.884s">I</a>  know we want to bring light to your church, and I applaud it, but at the same time, I think public safety has to be addressed in the sense that <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4183.673s">It's</a>  really, I don't know if you've been familiar with that area, with the Brooks School, with the traffic, with the speed at 30 miles an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4192.36s">People</a>  being deterred to look at such a daunting sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4199.046s">I</a>  don't know if I can support that.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4201.548s">And</a>  that's what we were thinking about is having people actually reading the sign as they were driving because we figured if the sign <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4211.932s">is</a>  too small, they won't be able to read it at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4214.913s">Because</a>  the current sign that we have right now is a six by seven sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4219.815s">And</a>  for the past couple of years, we actually have had a summer festival. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4226.218s">And</a>  people can't even read the sign that we had right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4230.14s">The</a>  day of the festival, people will stop by because they see activity. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4234.122s">And</a>  they come in, they're like, oh, I didn't even see the sign that you have right now, because it's too far back from the church. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4239.744s">And</a>  the current sign that we have right now will be in the same position. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4243.508s">So</a>  we figured people will still kind of maybe because it's back there with the light, they will probably see it back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4251.497s">And</a>  we have a big tree, like a huge tree, two big trees. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4256.282s">I</a>  don't know if you guys have ever seen that property. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4258.364s">huge</a>  tree in the summer, in the fall, you can even see the current sign that we have back there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4264.289s">We</a>  figured maybe with a little light, they may even see a little bit of the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4269.592s">That's</a>  why we requested that size of five by eight or four by eight maybe will be like a, it's even a smaller size than the one that we have right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4281.481s">We</a>  figured maybe with a little light, it might be a little bit better.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4285.342s">Now,</a>  if I recall, you also hang banners off that sign.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4288.963s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4289.643s">And</a>  they can't, they can't see it.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4291.984s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4292.344s">Well,</a>  this is pretty big. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4294.865s">Um,</a>  um, you're talking over 11 feet high from ground to the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4299.466s">So</a>  I, you know, is it, were there any other sizes discussed something?</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4304.288s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4304.748s">The</a>  four by eight, uh, the current, the current sign that you guys, uh, denied, uh, that's a five by eight.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4313.355s">No,</a>  the city.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4314.035s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4315.116s">I</a>  apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4315.836s">The</a>  city had denied was the five by eight and on the appeal letter I have mentioned the four by eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4322.979s">Um,</a>  it's actually was cheaper for us anyway because yeah, it was the four by eight was a cheaper price for the pastor. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4331.363s">So,</a>  um, uh, we had asked the, the, the, the sign company if he would do that for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4339.246s">He</a>  says yes.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4349.445s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4352.126s">Vice</a>  President Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4353.946s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4356.606s">The</a>  current sign is from the ground up five by eight, correct?</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4363.788s">Yes,</a>  the current sign is six by seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4366.608s">Six</a>  by seven.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4367.768s">Okay,</a>  you've mentioned five different sizes so far, just so you know.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4373.009s">The</a>  current size is six by seven.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4375.09s">Six</a>  by seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4375.97s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Exenor Fevrier]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4378.067s">We've</a>  got the original that the church used to use.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4380.848s">The</a>  one that's currently on the lawn now?</p>

    <p>[Exenor Fevrier]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4382.449s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4383.069s">It's</a>  six by seven?</p>

    <p>[Exenor Fevrier]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4384.149s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4384.349s">Six</a>  by seven.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4386.19s">And</a>  it's not elevated on a platform, it's on the ground, six by seven? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4390.892s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4391.732s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4392.412s">So</a>  is there any way that we can bring this sign, because if you look at your top signage, it's very close to conforming. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4402.156s">When</a>  you add in the pedestal, that's what blows this sign way out of proportion. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4407.5s">in</a>  my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4409.081s">Is</a>  there any way we can bring that down a little further and shrink the signage similar to what is out there? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4416.345s">I</a>  have no problem making it a little larger. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4418.986s">I</a>  like the colors of the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4420.307s">I</a>  think it's a very nice sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4422.207s">I</a>  think it's a nice looking sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4423.948s">And</a>  I think it matches the area of what you're doing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4427.79s">But</a>  I think the fact that your podium that it sits on, or base, is three feet six inches alone, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4437.47s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4438.23s">And</a>  then you have your sign sitting above that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4439.891s">It</a>  makes it look like a, a real giant sign in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4444.632s">And</a>  maybe if we're able to downsize that a little bit, um, and I have no problem making it larger than what the current ordinance calls for. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4453.335s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4453.675s">I</a>  have no problem making it a little larger than that because your church is set back. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4458.057s">And</a>  I think this sign does, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4459.853s">represent,</a>  hey, we're here, you know, and I agree with that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4464.034s">So</a>  if, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4465.434s">If</a>  I can interrupt you for a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4468.255s">The</a>  zoning board denied the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4471.676s">They</a>  didn't deny this sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4473.076s">They</a>  denied another sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4474.436s">So</a>  this, so I think the first one she mentioned was the five foot sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4479.058s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4479.618s">That</a>  was the one denied, so.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4480.818s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4481.458s">Now</a>  they're proposing a different sign than what was denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4486.079s">So</a>  this is a whole different sign than what was denied.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4489.978s">So</a>  this wasn't the sign that was denied?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4493.361s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4494.002s">The</a>  5-8.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4494.683s">The</a>  5-8 was denied, so this one here would have to go through the process all over again, am I correct?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4500.809s">So</a>  which one's the 5-8, the one on the second page?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4503.171s">It's</a>  not even here.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4503.812s">It's</a>  not here?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4504.592s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4504.853s">It's</a>  not even here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4506.534s">So</a>  again, this...</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4508.632s">The</a>  5-8 was the one that was denied, so what we're saying is we can have a smaller size.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4514.415s">But</a>  that's the one that you're appealing.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4516.556s">That's</a>  the one we're appealing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4517.937s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4518.277s">The</a>  5-8.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4518.818s">So</a>  this one here doesn't even come into play.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4521.399s">The</a>  5-8?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4522.059s">No,</a>  this one here, this picture that you're showing. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4525.081s">This</a>  is 8 by 11.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4526.161s">Oh,</a>  no, no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4527.802s">That's</a>  the 5-8 I made copies of.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4531.515s">That</a>  wasn't a five day. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4533.277s">No,</a>  that's why this, that's why the five day we would, this is 11 feet high.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4537.32s">You're</a>  saying this is a six. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4538.361s">There's</a>  a six foot tall man here.</p>

    <p>[Exenor Fevrier]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4540.763s">Oh</a>  gosh, no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4542.745s">That's</a>  not it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4543.726s">That's</a>  five eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4544.646s">You</a>  want to look in to put days up for four by five eliminated the pedestal. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4550.131s">It's</a>  like half size.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4553.474s">Uh,</a>  hang on one second. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4554.835s">Oh</a>  my God. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4556.136s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4556.557s">So</a>  where did this come from?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4557.578s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4558.298s">Where</a>  did this come from? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4561.284s">I,</a>  the city didn't make this up for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4563.105s">Did</a>  it? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4563.405s">No,</a>  it's a handsome six foot gentlemen though.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4568.427s">No,</a>  no, no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4570.748s">But</a>  the one that I sent to them, do you have a picture you could pass around to the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4578.27s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4580.051s">No,</a>  I think that's a, I think that's the one that I, that's the one that I, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4586.092s">Yeah,</a>  I think that's the one that I sent.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4587.552s">Mr.</a>  President, we might as well refer to this.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4588.813s">Because</a>  you have the 5 by 8, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4590.913s">Is</a>  that the one you have?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4591.634s">Yeah,</a>  why don't you do that?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4592.894s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4593.114s">We</a>  have 8 by 11.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4594.255s">Oh,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4594.895s">That's</a>  the one that I meant to send.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4596.715s">No,</a>  that's the one we have.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4598.676s">No,</a>  we don't have that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4600.816s">We</a>  don't have that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4601.677s">It's</a>  the same one, Rick. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4602.917s">It's</a>  the same one. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4603.897s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4604.378s">It's</a>  the same exact one. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4608.097s">Mr.</a>  President, can we refer this to the subcommittee as well, so we can clarify this?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4612.1s">We're</a>  going to meet very shortly, so we might as well refer this.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4616.562s">We're</a>  going to meet very shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4619.384s">Seeing</a>  that we have some confusion here with the petitioner, I'm going to ask that we take the suggestion that this be referred to the subcommittee also. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4629.951s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4633.733s">We</a>  didn't deny anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4635.194s">No,</a>  I give you guys the motion by councilor night.</p>

    <p>[Exenor Fevrier]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4643.178s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4647.42s">We</a>  now decide to buy the side that fall by it, not even five by eight.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4655.904s">But</a>  there seems to be some confusion in the size of the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4660.246s">I</a>  think in the subcommittee it would be a lot easier getting it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4663.511s">If</a>  we can, we'll say the setting is a little bit more informal. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4667.513s">And</a>  I think, I think you, everyone will know exactly what you want. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4671.074s">So,</a>  uh, uh, although we're going to take council on nights, motion to refer this, uh, to subcommittees seconded by yes.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4683.36s">So</a>  what we're doing is we're going to re we're going to call for a meeting relatively quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4689.832s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4690.072s">Hopefully,</a>  hopefully by next Tuesday.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4692.093s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4692.353s">So</a>  we can, we could see that the five foot sign and the five foot by eight foot sign and we could, we can talk about that in subcommittee and then bring it back out to the floor if everything works out so we can have this done by next week.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4705.936s">So</a>  put some paperwork back to John.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4708.097s">Just</a>  so we could see it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4708.957s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4709.157s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4709.417s">But</a>  please remember, bring a picture of the sign that you asked for originally.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4714.899s">Just</a>  bring that to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4715.879s">When</a>  we, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4716.735s">City</a>  clerk will contact you when we have that subcommittee meeting and you could bring those designs to us for what was denied and we can reverse that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4725.44s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4726.001s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4726.301s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4726.641s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4730.603s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4732.104s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4733.705s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4734.105s">While</a>  we're under suspension, Councilor Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4737.623s">paper</a>  in the hand of the clerk, please.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4742.006s">Offered</a>  by Councilor Lungo-Koehn be it resolved that the Medford City Council be updated with regards to what permits have been pulled for no parking on South Street and Walnut Street and be provided with an explanation on what transpired today. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4758.077s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4759.425s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4761.367s">I'm</a>  just looking for an update, maybe from the Medford Police Department, as well as the mayor's office, the administration, with regards to permits being pulled. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4771.234s">I've</a>  received a few text messages, an email, two phone calls, and a Facebook message with regards to residents being upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4781.262s">There</a>  were handwritten letters all around Walnut Street and South Street saying, do not park <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4790.005s">on</a>  Walnut and South, I believe it was sometime today until five o'clock tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4795.509s">It</a>  said violators will be towed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4798.252s">Now</a>  residents who live on South and Walnut and obviously have to park there through the night, tonight, were a little upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4808.219s">Most</a>  people didn't even call me first. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4810.341s">They</a>  called the mayor's office, the police department. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4813.223s">Everybody's</a>  giving everybody just different information with regards to what's going on, why is there no parking, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4819.625s">And</a>  then it became an issue with regards to, is this even being done legally? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4824.507s">Were</a>  the permits pulled? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4826.328s">I</a>  didn't talk to any of the police department yet, but I have heard through the grapevine that no permits were pulled to post those signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4834.032s">From</a>  what I understand, there is modular homes that were planned on coming down south and looping around down the one way down to Walnut to place the two modular homes on two obviously foundations. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4848.967s">So</a>  after collecting all of the information today and trying to piece together the puzzle, catch up on what I had missed after work, it was a little late and I'm bringing it up tonight, a little late to call people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4860.795s">I</a>  think I got the last of my information about 6.30 this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4864.678s">So</a>  if we could, as a council, get some updates because there are angry residents, people who are now upset because they feel like it was done incorrectly, to put it lightly. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4880.406s">And</a>  from what I understand, there were no permits pulled. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4883.99s">To</a>  bring modular homes, which are very large, pre-FAB homes, down two streets, down a one-way, you need detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4890.757s">And</a>  from what I understand, our police department knew nothing of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4894.981s">Details</a>  weren't hired, and permits were not pulled. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4898.865s">I</a>  also, from what I understand, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4900.735s">didn't</a>  get a chance to contact the mayor's office, but a lot of the residents did and the mayor's office may have been lied to. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4906.919s">I'm</a>  not quite sure of the full story. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4909.08s">So</a>  if we could get an update with regards to what permits were pulled, if they weren't pulled for today, were they pulled for a different day? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4916.965s">When</a>  is this gonna happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4920.967s">How</a>  long is this gonna take? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4922.828s">How</a>  many detail will we have present? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4924.569s">There's</a>  obviously a safety concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4926.671s">There's</a>  a parking issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4927.671s">People</a>  wanna be able to park in their own homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4930.814s">Medcalf</a>  Street as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4932.575s">So</a>  we really want to get an idea of, so we can be able to respond to our, you know, to all the residents on those two streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4939.937s">South</a>  is a very long street as well, and people were really, really upset. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4943.798s">It</a>  affected, I think it went, you know, public, so people all over the community were really upset with what went on and how somebody's allowed to get away with basically lying to the neighborhood if it was so a lie and there were no permits pulled. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4957.662s">So</a>  I, as one, want to get <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4959.285s">it</a>  all taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4960.405s">If</a>  this is gonna happen down the road, we wanna make sure permits are pulled, details in place, and the neighborhood is maybe given advance notice, two, three hour notice to not park or else you're gonna be towed in a handwritten note, really concern people. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4974.851s">So</a>  if we could get an update from the police department, our chief of police or traffic division, as well as the mayor's office, I think that's necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4983.414s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4985.435s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4986.576s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4988.185s">I</a>  appreciate, uh, council Longo current for bringing this up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=4990.826s">But,</a>  uh, I think if we can add an, uh, add something, uh, an amendment to this, that we also look into how we distribute signs and who distribute signs for, uh, the city during traffic and pocket for other issues and concerns in the roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5008.031s">I</a>  know that, uh, I did talk to a contractor today who said that they actually <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5014.902s">do</a>  this in other areas of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5017.323s">And</a>  there's really not a department that they can go to that has these signs when they legitimately close the street down. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5024.826s">And</a>  they actually use City of Boston signs and cross off Boston, put it in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5030.688s">So</a>  if we can get some information back from, I don't know if it's the engineering department, if it's the DPW, but if we can get some guidance there, really appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5044.033s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5045.001s">Councilor</a>  Neill. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5045.901s">Move</a>  approval of the question, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5049.103s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Neill, seconded by... Name and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5054.866s">Hi,</a>  I'm Cheryl Rodriguez. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5056.066s">I</a>  live at 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5057.867s">I</a>  did see a couple of versions of the sign that was supposed to close the street down, and residents were going back and forth, and I received a message from a friend asking me if this was a real sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5070.337s">Because</a>  people weren't sure if it was a real sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5072.618s">And</a>  if they had to stop parking there at 5 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5074.8s">today</a>  till 8 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5076.06s">tomorrow,</a>  that was certainly a hardship for people that live in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5079.563s">And</a>  who wants to try to rearrange your life if it's not a real sign? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5084.125s">So</a>  I did, in fact, go in person to the mayor's office, and I was helped by Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5090.249s">Lauren</a>  Felch, who was extremely helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5092.57s">She</a>  pulled up the flyer, she called the developer, and <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5097.493s">Who</a>  she believes was the developer was the number on the flyer was not a city number and was told that in fact they had gotten all the permissions that they needed and that the home would be being moved tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5109.437s">And</a>  it would be coming in at 7 AM. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5111.778s">She</a>  asked him why. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5113.567s">People</a>  weren't allowed to park there at 5 p.m., and he wasn't sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5117.15s">And</a>  when she concluded the call, I asked her if it was possible if she could confirm that there were permissions granted, and if there were permissions, if the city could send out a reverse 911 call. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5127.959s">Because</a>  it was really important that people knew that this really was happening, and this wasn't a sign, a fake sign that had been put up. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5135.005s">And</a>  Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5135.345s">Felch</a>  had expressed that, you know, a year prior, someone had put up signs that said street cleaning was happening in some neighborhood that were handwritten. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5142.45s">And</a>  people had moved and it turned out to not be true. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5144.711s">So</a>  she understood that a lot of people probably wouldn't believe this was a real sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5149.274s">The</a>  last information that I received when she called back after she had called various offices was that the project was halted for now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5157.939s">So</a>  anyone that lives in that area can park in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5161.441s">They'll</a>  be able to go to work in the morning because the house is not being moved now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5165.883s">It's</a>  my understanding that this is not the first home that he has moved in this way. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5170.027s">So</a>  I'm curious to know if he's violating some sort of rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5173.489s">Is</a>  there a department that's supposed to oversee when these homes are being moved, if streets are being closed off? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5180.816s">Is</a>  safety being factored in? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5182.257s">Had</a>  this home been moving through the neighborhood at 7 o'clock in the morning, school children would be out and about. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5187.841s">People</a>  would be trying to go to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5189.543s">People</a>  would be going into their cars to get out of their driveway and find out that they can't leave. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5195.147s">And</a>  if this has happened before and we didn't know about it, shame on us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5199.15s">So</a>  I hope that you all can look into it and find out what the process is. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5203.312s">This</a>  developer does own two to three more parcels in the city planning on doing similar things to those parcels. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5210.076s">So</a>  it would be great if he could have a plan from the city on exactly what he is supposed to do step by step before he moves a modular home into our community so that we don't have someone get hurt or miss work or anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5223.93s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Jean Nuzzo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5229.192s">Gene</a>  Newsell, 35 Power Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5231.593s">So</a>  I've been following this issue on social media, and I think that <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5238.829s">What</a>  we have here is a systematic issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5241.831s">And</a>  this all stems back, in my opinion, to the fact that these individuals coming into our city to flip properties are not encouraged nor are they required to engage with the neighborhoods that they're working in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5257.619s">Because</a>  they know they'll go to our ZBA they'll get whatever their variances are regardless of what our residents have to say and This is just a complete lack of respect for the people in the neighborhood, you know working in the industry If you asked anybody who is truly involved in the industry and not someone who's just flipping properties, but large-scale developers commercial high-end residential large-scale residential <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5286.792s">They</a>  wouldn't dream of doing something like this without some type of community meeting to advise people of what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5293.817s">They</a>  wouldn't come down these streets without the proper details in place and logistics in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5301.182s">And</a>  I'm not speaking specifically about this developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5305.444s">I'm</a>  speaking in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5307.966s">If</a>  you walk around and you speak with people, this is happening everywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5312.067s">Folks</a>  are coming in, they're executing their construction projects, and they're not keeping the folks around involved and informed as to what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5322.23s">It</a>  doesn't matter if it's a single unit, three units, or 490. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5327.811s">When</a>  you're building and you're around people, you have a responsibility to advise them. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5333.517s">And</a>  so I can appreciate that there are time constraints. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5337.46s">Perhaps</a>  the developer didn't have as much lead time for this delivery, but I feel if we did a better job, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5345.868s">at</a>  making sure that folks coming into our city to build, whatever it is, engaged with the people they would be working around and working in their neighborhoods where their homes are, things like this would not be happening and we wouldn't have folks as upset and concerned as they have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5365.544s">So</a>  I would hope that we would look at this as a larger issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5369.647s">I</a>  think it ties <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5371.99s">To</a>  you how we engage and how we communicate across the board With all of these various projects not this particular neighborhood not this particular developer, but overall there's really no mechanism that truly reaches <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5387.006s">Reaches</a>  everybody and I think that I would ask you guys as you discuss this further and look into it further that you think about This issue because as I said I think that if we had those vehicles in place and we had those opportunities for some of these community meetings I'm getting folks engaged in their neighborhoods to these people We we would do better and maybe feel a little bit more comfortable with what's going on Thanks.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5543.585s">Mr.</a>  President, a motion to waive the reading and a brief synopsis by the Director of the Board of Health.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5547.826s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5548.146s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Knight to waive the reading and if the Board of Health Director could give a brief synopsis, we'd appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5556.708s">Name</a>  and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5558.069s">I'm</a>  Marian O'Connor, Director of the Board of Health, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5561.889s">Thank</a>  you for having us tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5565.477s">FEMA,</a>  the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Region 1, has completed its review of Medford's hazard mitigation plan and found it approvable pending adoption by this honorable body. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5579.868s">It's</a>  my understanding that upon adoption, a formal letter will be sent from FEMA, which will be in effect for five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5589.536s">This</a>  formal approval will confirm Medford's eligibility <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5592.949s">to</a>  apply for mitigation grants administered by FEMA. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5597.29s">If</a>  not adopted, we would have to update the entire plan and submit again for FEMA review. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5604.332s">And</a>  so, you know, this has been a very long process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5607.613s">And</a>  I have with me Martin Pillsbury, who is with the Metropolitan Area Planning Commission, who has been involved in this process for several years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5617.756s">It</a>  took several years for this plan to get approved.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5620.416s">If</a>  I could interrupt you for a minute. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5621.897s">Excuse</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5622.983s">please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5623.343s">We</a>  have other people speaking here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5624.964s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5627.365s">So</a>  Mr. Pillsbury could address any specific plans about the, uh, questions about the plan itself.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5635.207s">Councilor</a>  nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5636.428s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5637.628s">Mr.</a>  O'Connor, thank you for being here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5639.669s">Uh,</a>  also to you, um, Mr. Pillsbury, um, question that I have would be, um, whereas you're coming from the metropolitan area planning council, um, I'm sure that you have, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5652.747s">a</a>  vast exposure to a number of these type of plans in our surrounding communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5656.428s">So</a>  the first question that I'd ask would be, how does this plan measure up to those plans that are established in surrounding communities, number one? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5662.49s">And</a>  number two, is there a regional focus that's taken when these plans are put together so that if a disaster does strike or has a dust strike and there needs to be mitigation, is there a regional response or is it more of a local response?</p>

    <p>[Martin Pillsbury]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5673.393s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5673.773s">Very</a>  good questions indeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5675.793s">In</a>  fact, most of your neighboring, many of your neighboring cities and towns have recently been through the same process of developing a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5683.187s">I'm</a>  expecting this is going to be in front of the city of Malden sometime in the next few weeks as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5688.231s">And</a>  in the last less than a year or so, it came up and was approved in Somerville, Cambridge, Everett, Chelsea. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5695.597s">This</a>  was part of a regional group of eight cities and towns that originally came together to do an update of your plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5702.823s">And</a>  I should say that this is an update to your original hazard mitigation plan, which was adopted back in 2008. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5709.188s">That</a>  was the first of these kinds of plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5711.07s">The</a>  program was new at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5713.234s">And</a>  the way FEMA has structured this, the plans need to be renewed on a periodic basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5718.137s">So</a>  this is your first renewal of your original plan, and as was also the case for all of your neighboring communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5724.66s">Basically,</a>  FEMA is very prescriptive about what goes in these plans. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5728.182s">There</a>  are literally codes of federal regulations that say, here's what the chapters and sections of the plan need to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5733.805s">So</a>  your plans are very equivalent to your neighbor's plans, because they pretty much all have to, in order to get FEMA approval, they will have to follow sort <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5741.65s">a</a>  similar consistent format.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5744.733s">And</a>  one other question, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5746.754s">Mr.</a>  Pillsbury, you are a professional in the field of environmental planning, and I don't know where you live, but with this plan in place, would you feel safe and comfortable living in the city of Medford?</p>

    <p>[Martin Pillsbury]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5756.34s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5756.941s">I</a>  think this plan will really help the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5759.642s">You'll</a>  see that it outlines a number of steps you can take over the next five years to put in place improvements to your infrastructure and drainage that would mitigate the kinds of flooding that you have. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5771.572s">And</a>  I should add that it was mentioned that when you have a plan like this approved, that makes the city eligible for FEMA grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5778.658s">And</a>  in fact, under your previous plan, the city did get a FEMA grant for work at Wright's Pond Dam, which was over a half a million dollar grant from FEMA. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5787.365s">So</a>  that's the kind of project, and there are a number of suggested projects in this plan that could be looked at in the next five years, some of which may be eligible for similar FEMA grants.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5795.751s">Excellent.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5796.312s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5797.353s">Based</a>  upon the discussion here, I feel comfortable <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5800.565s">voting</a>  in favor of this matter this evening.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5802.967s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5804.288s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5805.408s">You</a>  had mentioned a minute ago that there's a periodic renewal. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5810.932s">Is</a>  it every so many years?</p>

    <p>[Martin Pillsbury]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5812.593s">Five</a>  years.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5813.434s">Every</a>  five years? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5814.115s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5815.736s">Does</a>  it usually take as long as this took? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5818.458s">It</a>  seems like this was a bit lengthy.</p>

    <p>[Martin Pillsbury]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5819.638s">This</a>  took longer than average in a couple of your neighboring cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5823.221s">Got</a>  into a situation here where FEMA at the national level <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5826.508s">right</a>  in the middle of this process, changed the rules, basically, and changed the guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5831.909s">And</a>  basically, we were thinking, OK, they're not going to change horses in midstream. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5836.79s">We</a>  started the plan under the old guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5838.53s">But</a>  no, in fact, they insisted that the plan kind of be upgraded to the new. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5842.471s">And</a>  actually, it makes a better plan, because the change of guidelines that FEMA put in place was based on national experience over the first decade or so of this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5852.052s">So</a>  it actually made the plan better, but it also required <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5855.395s">more</a>  extensive review, and the review of the draft plan has to go through two levels of review. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5860.678s">It</a>  goes through MEMA, the Mass Emergency Management Agency, and then also through FEMA. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5865.04s">And</a>  in this case, because of the change in rules, it went through that process twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5868.102s">So</a>  it took longer to get through to the end of the process, but you have now got the approval letter from FEMA, and it's all over except for shouting, as they say. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5875.826s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5876.387s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5879.688s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5880.789s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5883.245s">and</a>  thank you for coming to explain everything to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5886.468s">Um,</a>  from what I understand after reading some of the report, this is meetings that took place in Medford from 2000 to around 2012, 2013 to the present and then was put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5896.779s">And</a>  I, as you had just spoken about is mainly a flooding is the main, obviously storms, hurricanes, things like that we're concerned about. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5906.188s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5907.174s">my,</a>  my main question really would be to the, to the city with regards to making sure this, this was a hundred page document, I believe, and making sure it's like on the city website so people can access it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5917.737s">I</a>  think it's important to be able to get the answer questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5922.238s">We</a>  can't talk about it all tonight, the hundred pages, but are there any specific points that you think are important for the public to know? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5931.52s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5932.737s">obviously</a>  live tonight, but then also we want to make sure it's on the website.</p>

    <p>[Martin Pillsbury]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5935.979s">We</a>  will absolutely make it available. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5938.04s">I</a>  have a hard copy here, but it's available as a PDF that can be put on the website. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5941.442s">In</a>  fact, when it was a draft and we had the public meetings, that draft was put on the website and was available for public comment during the production of the plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5949.907s">But</a>  now that it's finalized, you want everyone to know what's in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5953.489s">I</a>  guess I would say if anyone gets a chance to look at this a little bit later on, once it's up online, to look at the tables near the back of the plan, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5960.034s">table</a>  28 that actually lists the recommended measures, different drainage improvements and other steps. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5965.396s">That's</a>  really the heart of the plan saying, here's the things you can actually do that would make the city more resilient and less vulnerable to some of these hazards. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5975.759s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5976.959s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5978.019s">Councilor</a>  box.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5979.4s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5980.46s">And</a>  I too went through the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5983.001s">Um,</a>  I can remember last time was presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5985.001s">Uh,</a>  we actually had a committee, the whole meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5988.432s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5988.932s">And</a>  we discussed this with the entire council because it is such an in depth report. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5993.917s">And,</a>  uh, there's many facets to this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=5996.9s">Um,</a>  my, my question is to you, uh, you just mentioned, uh, recommendations and you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6001.704s">There</a>  are recommendations that were in the last five year plan that are still carried over. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6006.812s">into</a>  the next plan tomorrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6008.252s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6008.993s">Some</a>  of them are. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6010.253s">Um,</a>  I can remember the last several budgets that have come before this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6015.994s">I</a>  don't recall anything the administration has brought before us to be quite frank with you, uh, in ways of allocations to, uh, address some of the recommendations that were made in the last report. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6028.074s">Now</a>  that may have happened and I'm not aware of it, but I don't remember anything in the budgetary process. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6034.539s">Uh,</a>  when I looked at, uh, I forget what section it was under. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6037.281s">Uh,</a>  I believe it was recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6039.342s">They</a>  scaled it high, moderate and low. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6042.585s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6043.125s">Whether</a>  it was a high benefit to do this particular project or what the risk was, um, uh, you know, and based on high, low or moderate. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6052.712s">Now</a>  the areas of concern that I have that have been of concern for many years <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6056.475s">in</a>  this community are Main Street and Mystic Ave, in between, the whole neighborhood in between Mystic Ave and Main Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6064.701s">And</a>  that was considered, I believe, a very high priority due to poor drainage. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6070.865s">The</a>  same also applies to some sections of North Method, which we refer to the Heights, which also have poor drainage. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6079.652s">I</a>  just want to make sure that we're not just putting out a report for the sake of putting out a report <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6086.184s">and</a>  hopefully getting some funding and don't, we always welcome funding, especially from the federal government, but I just hope it's not a report that really has no tea to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6096.03s">And</a>  I'd like to see, we have over $7 million in our water and sewer enterprise account for these exact projects for drainage issues, uh, for, um, issues that, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6108.344s">I</a>  think could be addressed with some of that money. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6111.287s">So,</a>  I don't know if you can address that or not, but my concern is, you know, the flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6118.813s">I</a>  know some of the recommendations were as simple as we're notifying businesses to clean their catch basins on private property. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6126.3s">Now,</a>  that sounds like a no-brainer, but what percent of people adhere to that? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6131.864s">I</a>  mean, is there any follow-up? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6134.226s">I</a>  could tell you the catch basins on streets, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6136.468s">even</a>  though they're supposedly cleaned once a year, they're in deplorable conditions throughout the community, to be quite frank with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6143.772s">Many</a>  of them are clogged and in very poor condition, which leads to additional flooding. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6149.295s">So</a>  I'm hoping that it's not just a report in name only, that these recommendations are taken seriously by this administration, and they put forth, if we don't get grants, funding in the budget to address some of these very serious <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6165.702s">drainage</a>  issues, because when your basement has a foot of water in it, that's a very major concern for a lot of residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6172.508s">And</a>  when I'm at meetings in the Heights, and a woman's telling me up around Tamar Drive that her water pump runs 24 hours a day, seven days a week, I'm concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6182.978s">You</a>  know, those are concerning issues.</p>

    <p>[Martin Pillsbury]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6185.8s">So</a>  I don't know if you can address that in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6188.022s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6188.863s">Vice</a>  President Marx, let me say that that's music to my ears. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6191.705s">As</a>  a planner, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6192.67s">The</a>  thing we worry about most is trying our best to make a good plan and then having it proverbially gather dust on the shelf because no one implements it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6200.232s">So</a>  you're right on target to what, now you have a good plan here, it's been looked at by a lot of eyes and through FEMA and MEMA, and now it's really on the city to, over the next five years, implement parts of this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6210.815s">Now,</a>  on the positive side, this plan did go back and look at the recommendations made in your last plan and said, what happened to them? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6216.936s">And</a>  there's a table right in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6218.977s">Some</a>  of them were completed. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6220.705s">And</a>  those that weren't completed, for whatever reason, there wasn't enough funding or whatever the reason may be, we re-looked at them and say, are these still relevant recommendations? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6228.612s">They</a>  haven't been done. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6229.293s">Should</a>  they be carried in? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6230.674s">And</a>  they were. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6231.975s">We</a>  also added some new recommendations. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6233.776s">But</a>  over the course of the next five years, the idea is that you don't just sort of set this aside and wait for five years to come and renew the plan for the sake of just having a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6243.185s">There's</a>  actually a process in the back spelled out by which the city would continue <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6247.489s">occasionally</a>  convene this group that helped to put the plan together because it's a very interdisciplinary effort, has lots of different departments and commissions and boards involved, and it's a vision that you would over time take from these recommendations and move some of them ahead as you can, whether it's through a FEMA grant <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6263.513s">or</a>  through your own city funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6264.934s">And</a>  the table in here actually spells out where some of these might have to just be city funding because they're important, but they may not all be eligible for FEMA money. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6273.938s">And</a>  even those that are eligible for FEMA funding, FEMA requires a 25% local match for all of their grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6280.101s">They'll</a>  pay you 75% of a cost, but you still have to be prepared to put up something as well for those grants. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6286.484s">So</a>  it's very important what you say about keeping the implementation of this and making sure that it's not just a plan that gathers dust.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6293.538s">So</a>  just if I can ask you my last question. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6295.899s">So</a>  FEMA requires the report. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6298.241s">It</a>  requires cities and towns to present.</p>

    <p>[Martin Pillsbury]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6300.782s">If</a>  I could answer that, they actually don't require. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6302.863s">This</a>  is not a mandate like an unfunded mandate. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6305.525s">They</a>  require, what they do is they put the incentive in. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6308.406s">If</a>  you want any FEMA grants under this program, you have to have an approved plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6312.268s">So</a>  it's an incentive. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6314.169s">If</a>  you didn't ever care about getting a FEMA grant, you wouldn't have to do one of these plans and there would be no penalty other than that.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6322.755s">associated</a>  timeline that FEMA puts out saying, you know what, okay, these are your recommendations, Matthew. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6328.576s">We</a>  appreciate you putting together this report. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6330.517s">You're</a>  eligible for grant funding now. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6332.497s">However,</a>  we would like to see a percentage of these particular recommendations implemented by X date or at least reviewed by... You're asking some very good questions.</p>

    <p>[Martin Pillsbury]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6342.24s">The</a>  table of recommendations actually puts some target dates on when over the five years. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6347.461s">Would</a>  this one be in the first year or two? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6349.421s">Would</a>  this one be in year three or this one be in year five? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6352.324s">You</a>  actually have that in there based on the city's team's best estimate of when some of these would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6357.927s">But</a>  I will say that in the interim five years, FEMA does not come back and look over your shoulder and say, now are you making progress? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6364.711s">When</a>  you come and do your next five-year update, however, that's when you'll have to kind of the day of reckoning will come to say, what did you do with this over the last five years? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6372.355s">And</a>  did you, what did you implement and what didn't you? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6374.716s">So</a>  that's the time when it will come. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6376.877s">You</a>  don't want to wait until the last minute and be caught up short.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6380.079s">Have</a>  you ever seen FEMA deny a report?</p>

    <p>[Martin Pillsbury]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6383.17s">Oh,</a>  well, the plan.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6384.911s">Have</a>  you ever seen FEMA deny one?</p>

    <p>[Martin Pillsbury]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6388.453s">They</a>  don't use the term deny. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6389.814s">What</a>  they have done is returned draft plans with revisions required. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6395.938s">And</a>  that's actually part of what happened here because of the change in regulations. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6399.08s">The</a>  plan that was originally submitted met the old regulations but didn't meet the new ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6403.743s">And</a>  so they will often return these plans basically with revisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6407.005s">It's</a>  like turning in a paper to your professor and getting it marked up and say, go back and fix this. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6412.264s">but</a>  that's in the interest of making a better plan, not to be punitive to the community, to making a better, more complete plan.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6418.347s">And</a>  just Mr. President, my other question is to the board of health director. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6422.149s">Um,</a>  now that you are acting, I guess, full time or part time as the emergency preparedness person in the community where we used to have someone that did it as their job. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6433.275s">Um,</a>  although it may not have been a full time job, that was what they were dedicated to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6438.775s">How</a>  are you finding that now, in your role, a very busy office at Border Health, a number of employees underneath you, a lot of issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6446.357s">Are</a>  you finding yourself being able to spend ample time as the emergency preparedness person for this community?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6452.579s">I</a>  think you could spend a lot more time doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6455.28s">It</a>  certainly could be a full-time job. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6457.02s">But</a>  as part of public health, we do emergency preparedness planning all the time, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6461.721s">So</a>  it's been able to be part of my job, as well as working with MIMR. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6468.016s">I'm</a>  part of the Emergency Management Director Group with MIMR. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6470.958s">So</a>  I've been keeping up with them and trying to get a local committee together because it's not just a one-man job. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6476.3s">Emergency</a>  preparedness is really a huge job that requires multidisciplinary teams, so that's what we're trying to develop. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6482.924s">But</a>  I will be working to get a team together again to look at this plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6487.286s">I</a>  already talked with the energy and environmental folks, and we're going to be getting a local committee back together again to really revisit this plan and see what we can get done.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6497.878s">uh,</a>  committee for emergency preparedness. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6500.339s">It's</a>  just yourself. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6501.859s">Well,</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6502.739s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6503.079s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6503.68s">And</a>  in the past there was a committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6505.66s">I'm</a>  not aware of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6506.46s">Is</a>  it?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6506.94s">I,</a>  I, I believe that they should have been if there wasn't, but yeah, usually it's your public safety folks, you know, um, public health building, uh, mostly community development people who would be involved in the city.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6521.464s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6522.724s">I</a>  just want to thank you both for your time and effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6524.405s">This</a>  was a very lengthy and thorough, <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6526.556s">uh,</a>  report put together. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6528.437s">Um,</a>  and, uh, I think it does benefit the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6531.879s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6532.28s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6532.96s">Madam</a>  director. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6533.601s">If</a>  I could ask a question as, as a reviewing the report, um, um, Mr. Mangoni is still listed as the person on the, if we, if we could take his name off. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6543.327s">So</a>  if somebody wants to contact somebody and replace it with the proper person would be, would be appreciated.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6548.27s">We'll</a>  have to update that whole committee.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6549.831s">If</a>  you can do that before you publish it to the webpage, it'd be appreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6554.414s">Councilor</a>  Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6555.496s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6556.297s">I</a>  have a couple of quick additional questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6559.7s">So</a>  you had mentioned about this being a full-time position. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6563.143s">There's</a>  enough work to make it a full-time position?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6566.606s">You</a>  could spend — emergency preparedness, you could really spend a lot of time getting that.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6571.61s">So</a>  in your experience throughout the years, I mean, do you see other cities and towns that actually have a full-time person? <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6578.036s">I'm</a>  just curious.</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6578.736s">There</a>  are a few that have full-time. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6580.758s">A</a>  lot of them have part-time, but certainly there are — <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6583.41s">There</a>  are communities with full-time emergency management directors.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6587.473s">Do</a>  they more or less communities that maybe live closer to the coast or that are closer to the coast, I guess, or is it just in general?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6593.017s">It</a>  just varies, not based on location. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6597.561s">It's</a>  usually size.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6598.742s">Size,</a>  okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6599.382s">That</a>  makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6600.563s">As</a>  far as you had mentioned about putting a committee together, that committee's not together yet?</p>

    <p>[MaryAnn O'Connor]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6607.769s">Not</a>  yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/PZwU6Za1SNY&t=6608.309s">We're</a>  working on it.</p>
