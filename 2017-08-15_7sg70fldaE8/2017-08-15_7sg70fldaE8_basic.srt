00:17:44,455 --> 00:17:44,742
you

2
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:19,090
for the primary or against it.

3
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,545
you

4
00:24:47,512 --> 00:25:15,507
All right, we ready? Everybody ready? Anybody need water, any cold water before we get started? Yeah, I do. Only for voters. Mike? Read the label. John? Present. All right, is everybody ready? Is everybody ready in the other room there? Yeah, all set.

5
00:25:19,743 --> 00:25:47,975
Good evening, everyone. Memphis City Council, 27th regular meeting, August 15th, 2017. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. Councilor DelaRusso? Present. Councilor Falco? Present. Councilor Knight? Present. Councilor Long and Kern? Present. Vice President Marks? Present. Councilor Scarpelli? Present. President Caviello? Present. Please rise and salute the flag.

00:25:49,105 --> 00:26:14,452
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. I want to welcome everyone this evening to the Meffitt High School Media Center, and I want to let everybody know that this meeting is going out live. So I welcome everyone at home, and welcome to the new media center.

7
00:26:14,654 --> 00:26:22,180
Mr. President, motion to suspend the rules to take a paper out of order. Motion by Councilor Knight to suspend the rules, seconded by Councilor De La Rosa. All those in favor? Aye.

8
00:26:22,670 --> 00:26:49,028
Mr. Councilman, what are you taking out of order? We'd like to take the sisters for ovarian cancer out of order, Mr. President, if that's possible. Sisters for ovarian cancer. One second, let me find it here. Okay. 17605, petition by Carol Powers, 20 Walter Street, Medford, Mass., member of the Sisters Against Ovarian Cancer, to address the council and to hang teal bows at Medford.

9
00:26:49,788 --> 00:27:10,679
in a campaign to raise awareness to the signs of ovarian cancer. Carol is not here this evening. Carol is not here, so. And if you could please have a seat there. Name and address for the record, please. Judy Budney, 97 Mitchell Ave. Thank you.

10
00:27:11,692 --> 00:27:33,292
So I belong to an organization, Sisters Against Ovarian Cancer, and our main purpose is to raise awareness and funds, much needed funds, for ovarian cancer research. So as part of the awareness program, in the past few years we've taken part in a program called Turn the Town Teal.

11
00:27:33,292 --> 00:27:54,082
which for the whole month of September, which is ovarian cancer awareness month, we hang tail bows around the city for the whole month to raise awareness for this disease. And at the end of September, we take the bows down. Thank you. So we'd like to ask permission to continue to do that this year.

12
00:27:55,043 --> 00:28:04,139
You have a great organization, and I'm proud to be a supporter of your organization. Move approval, Mr. President. Motion by Councilor Knight to approve. Seconded by Councilor Longo Kern.

13
00:28:04,932 --> 00:28:27,038
All those in favor? Aye. Motion passes. Thank you. Good luck. Thank you. We look forward to seeing your ribbons around the square. Okay, I do have a form that needs to be signed by someone from the city. Is that me? Is that a check? No, but we're willing to take it. It's unofficial. I guess that's me.

14
00:28:27,494 --> 00:28:48,908
We have a website too. We have a website sistersagainstoc.org and you can go on to our website. There's a lot of useful information and we have our annual walk, our 10th year now.

15
00:28:49,212 --> 00:29:10,964
It's gonna be held on Saturday, September 9th. It starts at the Stone Zoo and it's a five mile walk around Spot Pond to raise money. And the funds that we do raise are donated to the Koch Institute at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. And they're doing some great research there.

16
00:29:10,964 --> 00:29:35,618
You also have a fundraising night also, correct? We do, that takes place in the spring. We had that already in May of this year. And to date, we're just a small organization, but we have raised over $225,000 for ovarian cancer. Thank you. Mr. President, motion to return to regular order business.

17
00:29:36,597 --> 00:30:04,390
Motion by Councilor Del Rosso to return to regular business. All those in favor? Aye. Aye. Motion passes. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. This will be a public hearing, 17-590. A public hearing will be held by the Memphis City Council and Community Access Studio at Memphis High School, 489 Winthrop Street, Memphis Mass, on Tuesday evening, August 15, 2017 at 7 p.m.

18
00:30:04,492 --> 00:30:13,790
on a petition from Medford Associates, LLC, Park Plaza, Boston, Mass, 02116, for a special permit.

19
00:30:14,127 --> 00:30:44,080
to amend the hours in accordance with Meffitt Zoning Ordinance, Chapter 94, Section 94-145, to operate extended hours at 3850 Mystic Valley Parkway, Meadow Glen Mall, Meffitt Mass, site being located in an industrial one zoning district as follows. Extended hours being requested Monday through Sunday, seven days a week, 6 a.m., 7 a.m. through 11 p.m. to 12 a.m.

20
00:30:44,519 --> 00:31:06,423
This issue may be seen in the office of the city clerk, Memphis City Hall. The city of Memphis is an EEO slash AA slash 504 employer. For information and accommodations and aids, please contact the city clerk 393-2425. And this has been advertised in the daily item on August 1st and August 8th. This is a public hearing.

21
00:31:08,633 --> 00:31:37,338
Name and address for the record, please. Brian Dugdale from Goulson and Storrs, 400 Atlantic Avenue in Boston, Massachusetts. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. With this said, are you here to speak in favor? We are here to speak in favor. I'm representing Medford Associates, which is the LLC in favor of the petition, and we are requesting a continuance of this hearing until September 19th. Thank you.

22
00:31:37,338 --> 00:31:58,145
Do we have to continue with that? Is there anyone else here speaking in favor of this petition? Hearing and seeing none, I motion that part of the hearing close. Is there anyone here in opposition to this hearing? Hearing and seeing none, I motion that part of the hearing be closed. Councilor Lococo.

23
00:32:00,237 --> 00:32:23,947
Thank you, President Carviello. I know you're going to extend until September meeting, but I think we did get an email with regards to the towers that are behind the property and the loading times. So maybe before then you can do some research and see what times the trucks are going to be delivering and unloading, just so even if we do want to extend your permit, we can

24
00:32:23,947 --> 00:32:43,201
assure the residents that live in those buildings that even though the hours of operations may be 6 a.m. in the morning or 11 p.m. at night, I think it was 12, 12 in the morning, that we know that the deliveries will not be at that time so they will still have peace and enjoyment of their properties.

25
00:32:43,488 --> 00:33:13,441
Thank you, Councilor, and that's something we'd like to address, and that's one of the reasons we're extending through until September, so we can hear, better understand the concerns of our neighbors. We want to be good neighbors and address those concerns at the open public hearing. And I think he said that they are planning a meeting with the Condo Association to address them in person and addressing their needs. Do we have a motion to table this? No, Mr. Perkins, just so I can ask the question here. Councilor, Vice President Max. Just what are the hours of operation of your other weapons stores around the area?

26
00:33:16,158 --> 00:33:41,656
They are generally 6 a.m. to either 11 p.m. or 12 p.m. There are multiple locations, none in Massachusetts that are 24 hours, but there's several that New England Development's been involved with and Lightman's have evolved in 6 a.m. to either 11 p.m. or 12 p.m.

27
00:33:41,656 --> 00:34:06,125
So we don't anticipate any plans to come back at a future date to if you were to be given the midnight To be looking for one two or three in the morning We don't expect Thank you, thank you do we have a motion to table this On the motion by council on the table this hearing all those in favor

28
00:34:07,947 --> 00:34:21,970
Motion passes. We'll see you. That's right. Thank you. Thank you. Thanks very much. OK. 17-591.

29
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:51,046
Location of poles, attachment of fixtures, and underground conduits, Memphis Mass. You are hereby notified that the order of the Memphis City Council public hearing will be given at the Community Access Building in Memphis Heights, 489 Winthrop Street, Memphis Mass, on Tuesday, August 15th, on a petition by Comcast Cable Communications Management, LLC, for permission to construct a line for such telecommunication under the public way of ways here. Mr. President, motion to waive the reading and have a representative from the petitioner have a brief synopsis of it.

30
00:34:51,046 --> 00:35:16,814
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks. All those in favor? Aye. Aye. Name and address for the record, please. Good evening. Dave Llewellyn, Comcast, Woobin, Massachusetts. This petition, Washington Street, will be starting at existing utility pole 5507, excavating in the sidewalk to place one four-inch PVC conduit 37 feet plus or minus to existing telephone manhole located in the sidewalk.

31
00:35:18,265 --> 00:35:40,760
Thank you. Well, this is a public hearing. Do we have anyone here to speak in favor of this? Would that be yourself? Yes. Is there anyone else in favor of this? Hearing and seeing none, I motion that part of the meeting closed. Is there anyone that is against this? Anyone not in favor? Hearing and seeing none, I motion that part of the hearing closed.

32
00:35:41,536 --> 00:36:10,595
Mr. President. Councilor Del Rosso. If I could, through the chair, ask the petitioner, what is the purpose of this? Is there a new, why do you have to do this? Is there a new building? We're tying into the existing Verizon manhole that ties into the conduit system that we're already into to provide service to 53 Riverside Ave., which is the Middlesex Bank. Very good. Mr. President. Councilor Belko. Thank you, Mr. President. Just a couple of quick questions.

33
00:36:10,983 --> 00:36:37,797
Just to get a little bit more background on this, how long will this project take? A couple of days. A couple of days. Do you know when it's going to begin? As soon as this is granted, we'll have the contractor go in and pull the street opening permit. Do you know how many sidewalk panels are impacted? Just so the residents in the neighborhood have some sort of idea. I think there was maybe 37 feet. I think there was maybe five panels. Give or take a couple.

34
00:36:37,882 --> 00:37:07,717
And will there be any impact with regard to traffic in the neighborhood? I would say no. I mean, I don't know if there's a lot of pedestrian traffic in the sidewalk there, but they can put some traffic control signs there to block the sidewalk and divert them around. And it's basically pretty much almost a day or two's work for the most part once they excavate it all out. And then the biggest part of it will be going back and replacing the concrete. That's what's going to take the time.

35
00:37:08,054 --> 00:37:26,819
Mr. President? Okay, thank you. So it's strictly sidewalk work? No. Yeah, nothing in the street. And what materials are used to replace the sidewalk panels, the same existing? Same, yes, it's concrete. Councilor Scott, go ahead. I think that I echo Councilor Knight's, one of the biggest concerns we've had in this council in the last couple of years, two years that we've been on set.

36
00:37:26,819 --> 00:37:55,979
that whenever there's a utility company that comes in, the way they found the street and sidewalks in a better condition than, if the same or if not better condition, than it was left, because we have a huge issue with contractors coming in, representing the utilities, and then leaving sub-par work behind, and then the city is left, and the constituents are left holding the bag, so I think that it's very important that that piece

37
00:37:57,886 --> 00:38:21,595
discussion with the city's engineer making sure that the most approach. Mr. President also looks here that the petitioner has agreed to remove an asphalt patch that's been put around another existing utility pole as part of mitigation to help fill those gaps with concrete to keep it consistent with the rest of the sidewalk. So I have no problem with this petition. Mr. President, I move for approval. Second.

38
00:38:21,595 --> 00:38:49,253
Motion by Councilor Knight to approval, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelley. All those in favor? Aye. Motion passes. Thank you. 17-592, location of poles. Attachments of fixtures in underground conduits. Mr. President, motion to waive the reading and have a representative from the petitioner give us a brief synopsis of the project. That would be, let me see, Siena Engineering Group.

39
00:38:51,329 --> 00:39:13,992
Name and address of the record, please. With Sienna Engineering Group, my name is John Kennedy. We're at 50 Mall Road in Burlington, Mass. Sure. So are you in favor of this? I am in favor. Do we have any votes in favor of this project?

40
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:21,367
Hearing and seeing none, I close that part of the hearing. Is there anyone here that wishes to speak against this project?

41
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:51,438
Hearing and seeing none, I motion that part of the hearing close. Continue. Okay, so this is a conduit build. I guess we're starting on Granville Avenue at the railroad right-of-way. We're replacing a handhold and we're constructing 200 feet of conduit to a manhole location at the location of Winchester Street and Granville Avenue. Then we're constructing another 722 feet to another structure, a manhole structure.

42
00:39:51,877 --> 00:39:58,373
And then from that, we'd go out to a Verizon manhole that's actually in the city of Somerville.

43
00:40:01,715 --> 00:40:26,774
Councilor Del Rosso. I have a lot of questions. Why? So on Broadway, there's a bridge that crosses over the railway. Yes. And in order for them to replace that bridge for the Green Line Extension Project, we have to relocate our cable, which is running right down the right of way. And the way to do that is to get it up

44
00:40:26,774 --> 00:40:35,887
into the Verizon structure and then take it from the Verizon structure down Winchester, down Granville, and get it back onto the railway beyond the bridge where they're doing the construction.

45
00:40:35,971 --> 00:40:58,381
Tell us about the type of conduit that you're going to be building. Is it a contained concrete tunnel? Is it a... It's typical construction with two four-inch conduits encased in concrete, 48 inches of depth down. And obviously, we're going to be looking to mitigate intersecting with anything else that might be in the roadway.

46
00:40:58,769 --> 00:41:27,912
And are you going to be digging in the road and the sidewalks? All on the road. And what kind of wiring is this? So what would go back, what we're relocating is a fiber optic cable for AT&T. OK. Councilor Falco. Oh, I'm not in the room, Mr. President. I apologize. Thank you. The people on Winchester Street have had the heck beaten out of them for the past five years, and they've been shanghaied every step of the way.

47
00:41:28,469 --> 00:41:48,770
The businesses on Boston Avenue with relation to construction tied into the Green Line and some related developments that are going to capitalize off of the Green Line have suffered tremendously. On Winchester Street, on the other end from where you're digging, down towards Harvard

48
00:41:48,770 --> 00:42:07,450
Residents were disrupted for two years with work that was done to accommodate the widening of the Harvard Street Bridge and dealing with a lot of the issues there, some of which were promised to be addressed and never were.

49
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:21,878
I speak of drainage issues in that area. So beneath the Harvard Street Bridge still floods. St. Clement's School, though it's in a transition, still takes on sewage.

50
00:42:22,199 --> 00:42:38,821
an elementary school takes on sewage. Now, I'm not saying that you are the cause of this. What I'm saying is that the people who I represent are going to now be faced with another in a series of disruptive construction projects that's going to

51
00:42:38,821 --> 00:43:04,285
challenge their egress in and off of their properties, is going to tie up traffic in a cut-through street that gets people between Harvard Street and Broadway and avoids using the ridiculous powerhouse circle, which has traffic patterns and timing there that is contrary to reason.

52
00:43:04,792 --> 00:43:26,527
What are you folks going to do for the people of Medford on these streets who've had to put up with this over the several years? And I'm not trying to put you on the spot or make you feel uncomfortable, but the fact of the matter is these people are hurting. And they need to be assured and in very concrete ways on

53
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:46,658
How are they going to be treated? How are they going to be communicated with? Is just a silly flyer going to be stuck under their doors? Are they going to have a normal person who's going to talk to them and listen to them? Or are they just going to be besieged with emails that get put into their spam box?

54
00:43:46,743 --> 00:44:10,553
No, I will definitely have a representative on site while we're doing this dig. To speak to those other items, this is not a project that's not even on that kind of scale. This is a simple two, four-inch conduit duct rework. So it's a typical trench that you might see in the roadway happening for gas, for instance, or anybody else.

55
00:44:10,553 --> 00:44:30,314
We're not going to be impacting in that that way. We definitely will impact traffic We have traffic plans that we submit to your engineering department and we will look to make it work with both the police department and Setting up traffic plans appropriately and obviously we'll listen to your constituency in the area while we're working

56
00:44:30,314 --> 00:44:56,285
So will there be someone on site who's going to be available and consistent to just help these people who really feel beat up at this point? Absolutely. Siena will definitely have somebody on site while the contractor is working. And who is Siena? Siena is an engineering firm and we're representing AT&T. So basically we will work with a contractor that will be on site. Good, good, good.

57
00:44:56,285 --> 00:45:26,272
Thank you Mr. President. Councilor Falco. Thank you Mr. President and some of the similar similar questions I guess but you know as far as that the length of time this project is going to take and when do you think this will begin just so if anyone here that was watching at home tonight. So what we're trying to do is get this done before December is our goal. Before the moratorium we'd like to get it done. We're still working out this grant allocation as well in Somerville and as soon as we get that we're going to get underway so

58
00:45:26,272 --> 00:45:51,787
We're in the process of putting all the pieces together. We'd like to get started as soon as possible. And we're looking at, depending on how things go and what the impact is in terms of traffic, it would be four to six weeks, I would think. But that's the outside. I can't say exactly. It depends on how long it takes us to get underway and if we run into issues in terms of traffic or if you have special events or any of those things.

59
00:45:51,787 --> 00:46:13,370
that might be impacted. I don't know if there are road races scheduled for the next couple of weeks. When we could get out there and get it done. And as far as the, so would the work hours be just your normal 9 to 5? Yeah, it would be. And if we were going to do anything, or if we were looking to get some relief on that, we would obviously come to the city and ask if we could do that.

60
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:33,637
And as far as the impact to the neighbors that live in that neighborhood, are we talking about they're not going to have access to their driveways? What will be the impact and how will they be notified? I think it would be minimal. Obviously, where we're working, it may take a day for us to get out of the way of a driveway, for instance, but we'll be looking to keep

61
00:46:33,637 --> 00:46:54,376
pedestrian traffic moving at all times, keep roadways open as much as we can, and keep driveways open as much as possible. So will you be, you know, sending a notice to the neighbors? I mean, just to let them know the driveway could possibly be not accessible, you know, during these dates? We certainly could do something like that if we needed to.

62
00:46:54,376 --> 00:47:09,462
I mean, I would think, you know, just I think it's a good idea just to let them know, you know, that this project is going to happen and, you know, just so they're informed. I mean, because I think the worst thing is when there's no communication, that's when the phones start ringing.

63
00:47:09,462 --> 00:47:29,510
that, you know what, I knew nothing about this. You know, the person that might live in the street might not know nothing about or anything about this project. They might have minimal information, but then all of a sudden they can't get into the driveway, and they're calling us for answers. So I think reaching out to the community, to those streets that are impacted and those neighbors that are impacted, it's definitely something that

64
00:47:29,510 --> 00:47:55,632
I would recommend. Yeah, and I believe we did send out a listing and mailing already. Okay, good. But once we get started, we can do that again. And I know one of the stipulations was that we get together and sit down before we get started. And we will have a schedule at that time where we can tell you what we think it's going to take us to get it done. Great, thank you. And as far as the, do you foresee any road closures at all?

65
00:47:55,632 --> 00:48:14,768
the way that we have our traffic plan set up right now there are no road closures so we're not we don't anticipate that there would be actual road closures. Okay I'm just concerned where if you because I think this this if I'm reading this map correctly this leads out to Broadway right? It does yeah. So I'm just concerned that if you if you're closing a road in Somerville and

66
00:48:16,152 --> 00:48:35,677
The residents in Medford don't know anything about it. There's a disconnect there, so if there are any road closures, you know, I would think that, you know, if we could just make sure that the residents know, just because the worst thing is when something insurmountable is impacting them and they don't know anything about it, you know, that's something that we should keep into, you know, take into account.

67
00:48:35,677 --> 00:48:58,205
Yeah, absolutely, if you look at the traffic plan, I don't think we're, we're not planning on closing any roads and we obviously would like to try to keep traffic moving in all directions. And, you know, setting up the proper traffic plan and also getting some help from both police departments to make sure that we can keep traffic moving, that's the goal. Okay, thank you very much.

68
00:48:58,205 --> 00:49:16,413
Actually, I think my questions have been asked and answered. Thank you. This is what it looks like, what, 948 feet of trench work that you want to do? I think it's about almost 1,100 feet. Almost 1,100 feet. Yeah. You said something at the beginning of your presentation. You said this is going to be common trench work like you see all around the city.

69
00:49:16,413 --> 00:49:39,194
And we've had a big problem in this city about trench work that's being performed by public utilities in the community. Just last month we had a committee of the whole meeting with the city engineer and we asked a series of questions to the city solicitor as to whether or not we could place a moratorium on trench work. One of the big problems isn't necessarily you guys getting in there and doing the work that you need to do because you need to get the work done. It's never coming back and fixing it to the standard that we want to see it fixed.

70
00:49:39,194 --> 00:50:03,680
That's become a very big problem in our community We're seeing a number of streets in residential neighborhoods the end and main roads alike, but again pulling up and torn apart I mean if you look at tonight's agenda for example We got 115 feet coming up after that and we're looking at 2,000 feet of trench work that we're gonna be putting through the city You know what? I mean? There's applications for 2,000 feet of trench work in the city and we have some questions that are pending right now before our

71
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:23,204
Solicitor that I think I'd feel a little bit more comfortable getting an answer to before I move forward and supporting this paper You know a thousand feet a lot of a lot of stretch on the end It's ten football fields councillor de la rusa was absolutely right that neighborhood has been beat on for the last three four years between you know the reversals of Winchester Street in the direction that it's going in and

72
00:50:23,204 --> 00:50:39,303
the impact that the expansions of the Harvard Street Bridge have had, the discussion about eminent domain land takings coming up in the near future to, again, accommodate the extension of the Greenland, which I think is going to be a benefit to our community, don't get me wrong. I think the Greenland extension is a good thing for us here in Medford.

73
00:50:39,303 --> 00:51:00,683
But in the meantime, we have residents that really need to maintain a strong quality of life, and that hasn't happened in that neighborhood. So this evening, I'm having a very difficult time supporting this paper, Mr. President, if we don't have the answers that are going to come back from the city solicitor based on the committee of the whole that we had. And the committee of the whole meeting that we had was exclusively focused on trench management and the issuing of permits to public utilities and what they do to our streets.

74
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:29,928
and whether or not they come back, and whether or not there's a schedule for them to come back, and whether or not we can limit the number of permits that are issued in a quarter or a year, so that we can better manage the job and better oversee the job that's being done, because I think that the focus is more on the next special permit than it is on coming back and completing the work from the last special permit that you got. Now, I haven't had the opportunity of working with Siena, and I'm not sure what Siena's reputation is or anything like that. I'm sure you guys are great. You're working for AT&T, which is a multinational company, you know, a billion dollar company, so I'm sure you guys do a great job.

75
00:51:29,928 --> 00:51:56,422
But we need to do some housekeeping here, in my opinion, before I feel comfortable supporting this paper. And I'm not going to be able to support it this evening, Mr. President, for the reasons that we've asked a series of questions to our city solicitor through the administration, asking for some input and some feedback as to what we can do to better manage the trench work that's being done in our community, because it's killing our streets, it's killing our neighborhoods. And the residents are speaking out against it in this particular street, in this particular neighborhood.

76
00:51:56,422 --> 00:52:18,275
They've been under the thumb of construction for the better part of three years. And it's not going to stop. And the work needs to get done, I understand. Yeah, unfortunately we're on a schedule here where we're getting forced to relocate because we're in the way of the apartment that's going to go in. And this is the way to get around that so that they can do that construction work.

77
00:52:18,275 --> 00:52:45,022
that's what's pushing us to get this work done. I understand that it's a cause and effect situation, I guess you'd call it. Well, we're on the right of way, and we happen to be on the right of way in the wrong spot. We're at the apartment where the bridge needs to be replaced, and this is the way to get around that so that they can move forward with their construction in December. In this alternative here that's being presented, I would assume would be the least costly alternative to the provider, right?

78
00:52:45,022 --> 00:53:03,888
I don't know if it would be the least costly, but it certainly is. Is there another way you can do it? We don't have to dig 1,000 feet in one of our city streets, I guess is the question. I don't think that there is another way that we could do that. I don't know that we could get our cable out of the way of the construction. You might be able to speak to that a little bit better than I could.

79
00:53:03,888 --> 00:53:26,500
Derek Anderson with our design professional representing MBTA 16 Myrtle Street in Medford. So I understand some of the trenching problems on a personal level. But to why I'm here, yeah, we have, the design team has looked at multiple different ways to keep the relocation of this particular duct bank within the MBTA right away under the bridge.

80
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:41,722
There is not a way that we have seen where we're able to avoid any disruption to the public streets in the area, the Boston Ave or Winchester. Winchester seems to be the best possible alignment for getting in and out quickly.

81
00:53:41,722 --> 00:54:06,325
And yeah, we've looked at those. To give some sense, Broadway Bridge, there's abutments coming down on either side, a new track. There's just no space between the abutments and the track to put that in. There's barely any space between U.S. Travel World and, you know, from what they've done over there. It's far away from the building, so I understand why you're not looking at it. We have absolutely looked to try to avoid disruption in this area. There isn't another way without getting into the roads.

82
00:54:06,325 --> 00:54:29,056
Or can you go underneath the real bed? Can you go through some holes? One way or another, it's got to come up onto the roads. And really, Winchester is... And what do these conduits service? Are they home telephones? Are they internet IP? Bandwidth? What do they provide? Yeah, it's AT&T's core...

83
00:54:29,056 --> 00:54:57,946
network, and it's carrying all kinds of traffic that is not only local, but it goes all over the place. This particular cable has quite a bit of traffic on it that can't be rerouted, unfortunately. The right-of-way was a place where they traditionally put a lot of network as a way to mitigate getting into town and city streets.

84
00:54:58,351 --> 00:55:15,935
And unfortunately, where it is right now, we don't have the ability to get it out of his way while he builds the bridge. And this is a way to work it out. And we are taking advantage of some structures that are already there and going through, coming out of the horizon.

85
00:55:17,656 --> 00:55:40,471
I appreciate you for answering my questions. I don't think my position is moving much off of Mr. President, although the answer is from the solicitor's office. I appreciate coming out tonight. I think that's one of the biggest things that we've talked about in this council. I'm sorry that you have a representative of this feedback, but until we make a stand,

86
00:55:40,471 --> 00:56:00,113
and really get the feedback back from the city solicitor and all of the utility companies that have been using our streets as trenches and then walking away and leaving our streets a mess. I think that with that and

87
00:56:00,113 --> 00:56:23,013
plan in place for those neighbors because those neighbors again, I echo the remarks of my colleagues that they've been impacted so negatively and They're just daily daily Lifestyles and to compound that with more construction road work without a comprehensive plan that they are familiar with from beginning to end I think would be

88
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:52,392
would be negligent and my part as a city council representing those people to not make sure that those concerns are not just supported by yourself, but a plan that would show us and what we can do. So I too would like to table this until we get more information from our city solicitor and what we've asked for in the past for our utilities

89
00:56:52,392 --> 00:57:09,959
to make sure that what's being done on our roads, that utilities are being held accountable for what they're leaving there. Yeah, we'd certainly work with you guys on whatever you needed to be, you know, comfortable with our construction practice.

90
00:57:10,499 --> 00:57:34,748
anything we'd need to do to help communicate with the neighbours, all the people that are impacted, we'd certainly be willing to do that. And again, I apologize that you could be the one situation where it would leave the street impeccable, but when you have two foot swaths being cut and then you see them dip and nobody comes back to fix them and then

91
00:57:35,187 --> 00:57:52,467
Again, someone comes in and builds a four foot swap path and nobody comes back and this is what we are hearing over and over again. And this is where it has been very frustrating for us. So thank you for your time. I appreciate it.

92
00:57:54,762 --> 00:58:17,341
I think some of the frustration you're hearing is regarding the number of projects that this city has gone through over the last couple of years. Eversource right now will be trenching two miles of some of our major thoroughfares in the next several months, which is going to be a big disruption to traffic and residents in this community.

93
00:58:17,341 --> 00:58:40,797
My question to you is we hear all too often when we ask when a trench is dug and we all know after even with best intentions It usually sinks after a period of time and we've asked the city Solicitor why we can't request that when you're digging a trench that you've not only just paved the trench but

94
00:58:40,797 --> 00:59:02,465
but you do a curb-to-curb restoration. And we're being told that we can't request that. And I believe it has something to do with state law, correct me if I'm wrong, but we can't request a curb-to-curb repaving. And in my opinion, if I allowed you to dig up some of my driveway, to put something under my driveway, I wouldn't request that you just patch a little piece of my driveway,

95
00:59:02,465 --> 00:59:31,237
Because I know what's going to happen in six months from now. My driveway's going to be a mess. And the same thing applies to our streets. So that's the first thing I think we have to look at, why we can't request a curb-to-curb. Was a curb-to-curb requested in this particular case? It was not requested in this particular case. You know, if you had something that was wrong with our patch, for instance, we certainly would want to try to restore the patch. So if the city did request a curb-to-curb, would you

96
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:51,149
That's something that I would have to bring back to see if that's something that would be an option. That would certainly be quite a big impact to the project. But maybe, I don't know if it's something that we could do. I couldn't answer that question tonight.

97
00:59:51,149 --> 01:00:05,932
It would be a bigger impact overall to the neighborhood as well. I understand that if we did have to do a full restoration for the entire trench, the trench line, that we would be looking at a pretty big impact.

98
01:00:06,404 --> 01:00:24,443
For the neighbors and everybody the construction project would be bigger than it would be Sure sure residents who call us up in six months from now saying every truck that goes by their house shakes their house because it's such a dip

99
01:00:24,443 --> 01:00:43,478
You know, we hear it over and over again. Right, right. So, I can appreciate the fact that... No, I understand that the roads are all over, you know, all over the state there's construction work going on and it's frustrating for everybody at times and patches to resettle and that's, there's no question about it that that happens.

100
01:00:43,478 --> 01:01:11,491
I don't know that I can say that I'd be able to do a full restoration this evening, but I could certainly inquire about it. We don't meet again until September, third week in September. Yeah, and my concern is that if we don't... We're not going to meet until the third week in September. Right, right, and that's my concern is that, you know, with the project, with the goals that they have for the bridge, that we're running out of time to get this project done.

101
01:01:11,491 --> 01:01:41,478
Well, I is one member of the council. I'd hate to hold up this project I understand that you're doing the project based on what work needs to be done, right? I Would have no problem if you would be able to give us a commitment tonight about curb-to-curb restoration That way I think would be an easier sell to the neighborhood knowing that this work is taking place But the ultimate outcome will be a brand new area street from the whole length You know, we go through projects like this

102
01:01:41,478 --> 01:01:57,543
the EverSource project I mentioned two months, it has zero benefit to this community. Zero. I realize we all have to live together as good neighbors with other communities, but it has zero benefit to our community and it's going to have a thousand percent disruption to our community.

103
01:01:57,543 --> 01:02:20,678
So those are the type of things I think we're struggling with. Yeah, I understand. I'd be supportive tonight if you would give a commitment. If you can get on your phone, give a commitment for a curb-to-curb restoration. Is that something that I could come back in, if I could get a few minutes and see what I can do? If the members feel the same, I feel that way. I think that would be a win for our community if we were able to repave the entire area.

104
01:02:22,147 --> 01:02:50,260
Thank you. Councilor Del Rosso. Mr. President, I wouldn't be so strict as to require that. I'd certainly invite it. I am intimately aware that neighbors, that's the neighborhood I live in. I know what my neighbors have been going through and I've been working on this as the city's liaison on one of the city's liaisons on this Green Line Extension project for

105
01:02:52,184 --> 01:03:05,414
12 years, 14 years, something like that. And they're finally digging, they're finally going, and we want to get it done. People want to see it done.

106
01:03:05,566 --> 01:03:29,225
And so I wouldn't want to be part of impeding construction. And I can only imagine that Winthrop Street will be dug up again. And certainly our neighbors up there will be dealing with the ambient noise of ongoing construction for the next several years with the construction of the station.

107
01:03:29,225 --> 01:03:54,149
the rail bed, and then also the continued presence of the lower line moving eight, what was it, 18, 27 feet closer to their homes, and then the squeaks and the clickety-clacks of the Green Line streetcars. So, that being said, I,

108
01:03:55,027 --> 01:04:12,982
I'd like to see curb-to-curb restoration of the street, but I also know that that might involve its own inconveniences to the people, but my concern was chiefly on their having avenues of communication.

109
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:33,704
in a way to get assurances that the concerns are going to be met, but I'll gladly yield to my dear colleagues and support that, but I certainly don't want to, I don't see a need to table this tonight, nor do I see a need to withhold it.

110
01:04:34,092 --> 01:04:46,512
and whole so I would like to move on it decisively tonight. Thank you, Mr. President.

111
01:04:47,120 --> 01:05:10,745
Based upon your plans and construction guidelines and so forth, do you see a need to do any more underground work on Winchester or Granville before the completion of the Green Line extension? As part of this project, we're not anticipating utility work on Winchester or Granville. Because part of the concern would be if we did go curb to curb, then that would put in effect a moratorium for digging. So we require to go curb to curb.

112
01:05:10,745 --> 01:05:40,411
and paved the whole entire street, then we could say that they can't think for five years. Are there other plans for other utilities to work through that area? I don't know the answer to that question. That's why it's better for them to do it the new way. I see if that's the way to do it. They did the water and gas, that was two years ago, three years ago. Council Member Kern. Thank you, President Carviello. I see everybody's frustration, and we've had a number of Committee of the Whole meetings to try to remedy it, and we are awaiting answers.

113
01:05:41,086 --> 01:05:59,463
Curb to curb will be great, but for me, what I keep bringing up in the last several years that this has been a real problem is the fact that we don't have anybody from the city to review the trench work six months from now, a year from now. So, I mean, I'd be amenable as long as we have a condition on there that

114
01:05:59,783 --> 01:06:17,755
engineer or somebody from the administration does a walk-through with somebody from your company nine months from now or a year from now and if there is sinkage that it be fixed. I think that might be another option. I think everybody touched some great points.

115
01:06:17,755 --> 01:06:44,333
the more detailed agenda for our constituents and those neighbours that are going to be affected, I think would have to be something that's necessary. Yeah, we definitely are interested in that. You know, I did talk to the city engineer and that was one of the points that she brought up is that we did have to meet before we got started. We were going to have a construction kick-off and I think we could address some of those concerns with the neighbourhood.

116
01:06:44,333 --> 01:07:11,705
and I've actually been given the okay to do curb-to-curb if you guys would like us to do the curb-to-curb, so. In the petition, it says AT&T shall provide a full-time resident engineer approved by the city who will monitor the work on the city's behalf. AT&T will provide detailed scheduled weekly updates, so it is in our context somewhat. Councilor Knight. So you just said that you've gotten the authority to do curb-to-curb? I have, I've gotten the approval to do curb-to-curb if you guys would like to do it.

117
01:07:11,705 --> 01:07:33,592
Can I elaborate on my response? Please. As you know, this is a design build, so when I say that we're not anticipating any work there, I can't say that there won't be any work, because I don't know what the design build is that was proposed, but we're not anticipating work there. I anticipate it, and the other question I have was would

118
01:07:34,958 --> 01:07:57,082
You have a pre-construction meeting, obviously, with our engineering department. Absolutely. Absolutely. Would you be willing to have a pre-construction meeting at maybe the South Metro Fire Station with the same people that are the abutters that are on your abuttal list? Yeah, absolutely. Why not? You know, we certainly want to keep everybody happy. We're interested in having good neighbors and keeping everybody as happy as we can. We are going to be constructing. We are going to be impacting traffic. That's unavoidable.

119
01:07:57,082 --> 01:08:27,068
but we're interested in getting the project done as quickly as possible with the least amount of disruption. Mr. President, I think we're making good progress tonight. You know, a curb-to-curb solution is something that... So it's just my agreement that you're agreeing to a curb-to-curb? Yeah, we're in agreement. And so could we have that as a condition? If you could put that as a condition, Mr. President. And just another condition that there's a meeting that's held for construction with the residents that are at Butters. At Butters, Upper Butters.

120
01:08:27,068 --> 01:08:54,372
Thank you. On the motion by Councilor Del Rosso, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli. As amended. All those in favor? Aye. Thank you very much. Councilor Scott Pelli has requested a roll call. Councilor Del Rosso, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli.

121
01:08:54,845 --> 01:09:13,593
Councilor Del Rosso? Yes. Councilor Falco? Yes. Councilor Night? Yes. Councilor McKernan? Yes. Vice President March? Yes. Councilor Scott Kelly? Yes. President Caviello? Yes. Seven in the affirmative, nine in the negative. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you guys.

122
01:09:18,183 --> 01:09:31,700
17, 593, location of poles, attachment of fictions, and underground conduits. Mr. President, motion to waive the reading and have a representative from the petitioner give a brief synopsis of the project. I'm not going to say it, this is Comcast again.

123
01:09:32,493 --> 01:09:53,789
Name and address of the record, please. Dave Pauling, Comcast, moving Massachusetts. And you are here in favor of this project? Yes, I am. Do we have anyone else here in favor of that project? Hearing and seeing none, I close that part of the hearing. Do we have anyone here against this project? Hearing and seeing none, I close that section of the hearing.

124
01:09:54,599 --> 01:10:15,625
continue. High Street, placing a new 4x4 manhole over the existing Comcast conduit at the intersection of High Street and Hillside Avenue. From the newly placed manhole, excavating to place a 4-inch PVC conduit 115 feet plus or minus and continuing into 92 High Street, Medford, which is the Armory building.

125
01:10:16,486 --> 01:10:34,188
They've requested our service and this is the plan to provide service to them. Thank you. Councilor Falco. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. President. Similar to a lot of the questions I asked previously regarding that previous project, when will the work take place and how long will this project last?

126
01:10:36,027 --> 01:10:52,379
Once approved, if approved, we're still waiting for an MWRA permit that they have. We have received the permit. We have signed off on it. We've reviewed it. We've agreed to it. It's back with the MWRA. They have a new process now where we sign off on the permit first.

127
01:10:52,379 --> 01:11:21,033
then we send it back to them and it basically goes through their board again, takes two weeks to get it signed. So I was hoping to get this work done if approved before Labor Day, before school started. However, it looks like it's gonna be sometime after Labor Day before we get that MWRA permit from them. The work should take, depending upon the digging, it is only 115 feet and a four by four manhole. I would say probably a week, depending upon the digging, weather permitting.

128
01:11:22,231 --> 01:11:38,600
two weeks, maybe tops, it's kind of hard to say, not knowing exactly what's in there and what they're going to run into as far as the digging. And it's on High Street, right? Yes. I assume the road's going to be open, but I would imagine it's going to be probably tough to pass at times, I would think.

129
01:11:38,887 --> 01:12:04,047
Yeah, I did see I printed the agenda this morning and I did look at this and I did see that the chief engineer requested a traffic management plan. I did also request that today from our traffic management people. So I'm hoping to get that and, you know, shortly after Labor Day, I'll be able to, you know, bring that into the chief engineer and we can talk about if approved, moving forward with the with the work. Okay.

130
01:12:04,891 --> 01:12:32,583
There is a chance that on Hillside Avenue, the existing conduit may be damaged. So I thought that I should put this in here and make you aware of that just in case we do have to do some additional excavating on that road. So there would be no surprises if this project does extend a little bit longer than anticipated. Hopefully we can get through that conduit, but we think it may be damaged. What information, Councilor Scarpelli? How many more feet would that be if there was damage?

131
01:12:33,427 --> 01:13:02,198
I would have to look at the plan here. I'm not sure if he called that out. 180 feet. An additional 180 or 180 total? Additional 180. Mr. President, so with that additional 180 feet, so how long that work would take if you have to

132
01:13:02,317 --> 01:13:24,018
Again, it depends upon the digging. I know that's kind of off the, you know, not as busy a street as High Street, but, you know, I'm sure there's a lot of traffic that goes up and down to that area, and I believe, is it the library that's right there also? Yeah, the library exits from there, and there's a couple of streets that are up in that area, so those neighbors, those residents will be impacted, it sounds like, if there is

133
01:13:24,018 --> 01:13:40,538
I'm hoping we can get through it. We'll send a crew out there before we stop this, before we start the digging out on the main run, to see if we can get a rod through it. Best case scenario, maybe it's just damaged in a couple of spots and we have to, you know, pothole it and dig it up and repair it. That would be the best case scenario.

134
01:13:42,327 --> 01:14:03,117
Thank you. Yes. Absolutely. Sir, when we just did the last permit. Yes. And can we have some of your feelings concerning a curb to curb pave on this project as opposed to a trench and patch in a crowd? OK, again, I did see that in the comments from the chief engineer and it did call that out from trench.

135
01:14:03,117 --> 01:14:29,105
To pay from the trench to the curb I would also I would need to go back if this was approved I would go back and just make them aware of that that that would be the requirement of the permit and Therefore it would be a business decision on our end if we were to move forward and then physically go apply for the permit so if it was approved tonight and we agreed it was agreed to you know grant the location and

136
01:14:29,105 --> 01:14:53,017
And then if I go back and the powers to be decide that this is cost prohibitive to do the paving to the curb, then therefore we would not apply for the street opening permit and not provide service to 92 High Street. Through the chair, President Carviello, so 92 High Street doesn't have Comcast service at all? They don't.

137
01:14:53,658 --> 01:15:08,643
And who's requesting it? The whole building? I don't have the name. I don't have the name of the customer. I was just tasked with getting the permits to get to the building. And then once it's there, X number of tenants within that building could request the service. So it's at least one.

138
01:15:10,921 --> 01:15:36,301
Thank you. Councilor, Vice President Mox. I believe, and I stand to be corrected, it may be a new dental group that's moving in that's requesting this. And I would hate for Comcast to go back and then decide it was not cost effective to provide service. This new business is just opening and actually reached out to me as one member of the council, seeing when it was gonna be on our agenda.

139
01:15:36,301 --> 01:15:56,500
So, they're really interested in getting the service to get their business up and running. So, at this point, I would, as one member of the council, just support the current work that's going on and then we can have other discussions regarding curve to curve and so forth.

140
01:15:59,487 --> 01:16:28,478
with the same issues that I've had. Again, this is a little different because it does affect constituents that need to move forward, but if approved, the same stipulation, would the residents, would you require that, would you input a plan that residents would hear, would understand the total agenda from beginning to end so they understand the

141
01:16:28,478 --> 01:16:43,953
complexities of the project and any issues or concerns that might come up. Are you saying having someone on site or just having a point of contact for the project? We have had a point of contact.

142
01:16:44,645 --> 01:17:09,316
reaching out to the residents and same thing, holding a meeting or getting a detailed agenda for them, schedule for them so they understand what might happen. At least the abutters to this project understand the complexity of the job. Yeah, we could do that.

143
01:17:09,772 --> 01:17:26,849
There's a location that you're requesting to dig, and I'm sure you're from around the Woburn area, so I'm sure you're familiar with the area, but right at that particular location, there were points in time where there were two MBTA buses that are driving down the street and they can't even get by each other.

144
01:17:26,849 --> 01:17:43,572
It's very difficult to see what impact this is really going to have on the traffic flow in the square and the business district. We had a gentleman from the square who owns a business down there, a restaurant that's getting killed by construction on the other side of the square.

145
01:17:43,572 --> 01:18:04,683
right up the street on the other side. So two points of entrance to certain businesses are going to be blocked or hampered or impeded for a period of time. Now I know you're only going to be out there for one or two weeks tops, as you said, on High Street. And then if any residual effects happen, I'm assuming that the rest of the repair work would go up Hillsdale Road if it's damaged? Yes. Okay. And that's not a major act, I don't think, it's a neighborhood.

146
01:18:05,020 --> 01:18:29,573
That's not something I'm so worried about right now, because you guys don't know what's underground over there. You don't know if there is a problem over there. But the concern that I do have is with flow and with the trench repair work. And I'm not going to give the same 25-minute thing that I just did at the last one. But ultimately, you know, we have a problem in the community with the way that our trenches are managed and our trenches are overseen. And I don't think we're doing a very good job at it. We need to do a better job at it. So in order for me to be comfortable with this, I need some insurances.

147
01:18:30,316 --> 01:18:52,591
Well, I can say that I'm familiar with the process, and I don't know if you're familiar with this process, but we have an inspection process, and I don't know if we've done a whole lot of work in the city over the past couple years. This is the first hearing that I've been to in Medford, so the person who had the town before had since retired, so I don't know what work took place before then. I'm sorry? Did he retire because of us? No.

148
01:18:52,591 --> 01:19:15,575
I believe it was back in the 90s, somewhere along the 90s, the Department of Telecommunications and Energy came out with something called DTE 9822, which is an inspection process. And we have our project coordinators who are assigned to this job go out and inspect the jobs 30, 60, and I believe it's either 90 or one year. And there's a report that goes to the state every year.

149
01:19:16,233 --> 01:19:39,149
So that's a task that when we do new trenches that our project coordinators are tasked with doing. Again, I don't know if there's been a whole lot of trenching in Medford, so I can't, you know, really speak to that, but that is one of our processes, and we can, you know, it would be certainly part of this. There's been plenty, but not the concrete amount of trenching in Medford. Council Member Kern. Good, Chair. Thank you, President Carviello.

150
01:19:40,735 --> 01:20:10,385
I think since you need a permit from the MWRA, I'm just throwing it out there that we table it and get a response back from Comcast for our next meeting of whether or not you'll do curb-to-curb. I just have an issue. I mean, I said in the last petition that I just don't want the trenches to keep sinking. It's, you know, not right for a contractor to leave a piece of property like that, a street or a sidewalk, you know, sinking. But I have a problem with requiring curb-to-curb in the last one.

151
01:20:10,722 --> 01:20:39,916
kind of swaying from that here, so I would like, I'm not, I think it should be, if we're gonna, we need to have a meeting, probably a committee of the whole meeting, and get some answers from you of whether you do the curb to curb, because that's a main thoroughfare, we definitely don't want any sinkage on High Street, and if we're gonna mandate some curb to curb, I think we need to figure out some consistency in how we're gonna do that. I know the business needs, wants Comcast, we fought loud and clear years and years ago that there'd be competition, so I,

152
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:51,509
We don't feel that the business should have it, but we just need to figure out amongst ourselves some way to keep this consistent and uniform and figure out how to do that prior to probably our next meeting.

153
01:20:52,218 --> 01:21:12,957
Mr. President, if I could. Councillor Marks. Typically what happens is it's the city engineer that requires, when they meet with the city engineer, whether it's going to be curb to curb or not. So I think we should leave that up to the druthers of the city engineer. On this particular case, as I mentioned, this particular business has a hardship.

154
01:21:12,957 --> 01:21:28,533
And they need this Comcast to run their business. And, you know, I don't feel comfortable waiting three weeks. It happens on the last petitioner that there was someone in the room that had the authority to grant the curb-to-curb. This gentleman clearly does not have that authority.

155
01:21:28,533 --> 01:21:56,849
And because of the hardship of that particular business that's going into 92 High Street, I don't feel comfortable, Mr. President, leaving this for another three weeks. So I will support this tonight. And moving forward, I think some of our questions should be directed to our own city engineer and our own inspectional services on why work is not being put back in the manner that we see fit. So I will support this petition tonight based on that, Mr. President.

156
01:21:57,187 --> 01:22:19,748
through the chair I know you said you wouldn't be able to start until sometime after Labor Day anyway so I think that would only be almost a week postponement if we take this up with some answers from Comcast on September 19th and I think we need to again we just need to be consistent so I would ask my colleagues how they feel about tabling it for three weeks

157
01:22:20,103 --> 01:22:31,932
I'm ready to vote on it in approval, Mr. President. Money that Comcast gets out of me every month, I'm sure they'll be able to

158
01:22:32,810 --> 01:22:55,642
Pape High Street from Arlington to Malden with no sweat. Motion to table. We have a motion by Councilor Knight to table. Do we have a second? I'm the second. Motion by Councilor Longo to table it. Seconded by Councilor Knight. All those in favor? Roll call vote, Mr. President. Roll call vote has been requested.

159
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:17,528
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. Councilor De La Russa? Negative. Councilor Falco? Yes. Councilor Knight? Yes. Councilor Kern? Yes. Vice President Marks? No. Councilor Scott Kelly? Yes. President Caprio? No. Four in the affirmative. There's four to three at the table.

160
01:23:19,047 --> 01:23:46,148
Can you get us that, do you mind, through the chair, get us that answer of whether or not you could do curb to curb? I'm sorry? If you could get us those answers before the next meeting. Yes. Thank you. When will that next meeting be? September 19th. September 19th. Thank you. Where are we going to meet September 19th? That'll be determined this week and once we have the construction schedule. 17594, that's the location.

161
01:23:46,672 --> 01:24:15,983
Mr. President, motion to waive the reading and have the petitioner give a brief synopsis of the application. Do we have someone here? Name and address of the record, please. Matthew Carmody from National Garden, 170 Medford Street. And you are speaking in favor of this? Yes. Do we have anyone else speaking in favor of this project? Hearing and seeing none, I close that part of the hearing. Do we have anyone here that is speaking against this?

162
01:24:17,806 --> 01:24:39,929
Hearing and seeing none, I close that portion of the hearing. Thank you. This petition is installing a traffic control box to operate and monitor our existing gas regulation station. This is replacing outdated equipment to make sure we can monitor for safety and reliability purposes and communicate to our pit itself to monitor the gas system throughout the year. Thank you.

163
01:24:40,688 --> 01:24:51,100
Councilor Falco. Thank you, Mr. President. If you could just tell us a little bit about the project, how long it's going to take, the hours you're going to be working, how many sidewalk panels you're going to be pulling out.

164
01:24:51,590 --> 01:25:17,020
Some of the sidewalk panels were already excavated. They're in temporary asphalt at the moment from our previous project on Wyman at Woburn So about six to seven asphalt concrete patches should take a few days regular work hours This has been pre-construction job walk has been performed with the engineering So it's generally to take three to four days I'd say at most and all panels will be fully put in 88 compliancy and make sure it's reviewed afterwards with the city engineering department

165
01:25:17,020 --> 01:25:39,802
Will they be replaced with concrete? Yes. Even the ones that are temporarily been replaced with asphalt? Yes, so we temporarily pair them so our concrete subcontractor come in and make sure it's AD compliant, stamped, and so forth. It's also in asphalt because we knew this work would be oncoming. So it's only for about two to three weeks that they certainly have been in asphalt. So as soon as this work is performed, our subcontractor will come in, perform the restoration with concrete.

166
01:25:39,802 --> 01:26:03,325
This is sidewalk work, so you don't anticipate any road closures? There shouldn't be any road closures. If there is, it would be for one day max. If so, it would be communicated with the city. This work will be fully communicated with the neighborhood. My cell phone number is on a letter that's hand-delivered to every resident. That's a butter that was given in the petition. Also, we do mail out three separate letters, one with two YouTube videos.

167
01:26:03,325 --> 01:26:27,203
to explain exactly what to expect during our work, also frequently ask questions and so forth. But again, we do hand deliver every single letter with my cell phone number to personally contact me to make sure no one's inconvenienced and we work with them hand in hand. Thank you. And that's key that you actually have included your cell phone number because it's always good that we have a point of contact and that the residents have a point of contact and especially to

168
01:26:27,203 --> 01:26:56,667
No, like you said, to supply a YouTube video, which I don't think you hear that too often, but it's always nice that the residents can actually see what's going on or, you know, get more information as to what's going on in front of their homes. So thank you very much. Councilor Knight. Mr. President, thank you very much. And Mr. Camardi, thank you for being here again. I think we're all familiar with Matthew. He's been here a number of times before. I request a permit. This particular permit, I have no problem with. I'll certainly support it this evening, and I look forward to the next permit to come back for some street trench works. We can talk about curb-to-curb paving on one of those jobs.

169
01:26:56,667 --> 01:27:19,651
It seems to be a hot subject. Thankfully, I'm in the sidewalk this time. On the motion. Move approval, Mr. President. Second, Mr. President. Approved by Councilor Dela Russo, seconded by Councilor Layton. All those in favor? Aye. Motion passes. Thank you. Thank you. At this point, I relinquish the chair to Vice President Marks.

Mr. Chairman, I request that this paper be withdrawn. The Council President requested that the paper be withdrawn. Will you call the roll? I think somebody wanted to speak on this. I'm withdrawing.

182
01:31:50,157 --> 01:32:19,132
for the inconsistency of the pay-to-park. I have right now two citizens in attendance to explain to you about their mishaps. So I'd like them to explain them, because you'll get a better variable speed on how they've had their problems. And then I'd like to finish off with a statement from another citizen who could not make it tonight, and then a small closing, and I'll be done, so it'll be quick. Would you yield the chair to the people who want to speak? Yes.

183
01:32:22,574 --> 01:32:45,220
Name and address of the record, please. Dan Papaleo, 10 Brooks Park, Medford, Mass. On July 27th, 1.23 a.m. in the morning, I was issued a citation for restricted parking in grass and dirt for $50. What street is it at? Brooks Park. Brooks Park? Yes. Which there were no signs.

184
01:32:45,490 --> 01:33:13,385
Posted I was not parked on the grass, you know this hot top that's missing so I'm in the dirt and it's you know kind of congested there and I went up and filed for a hearing which I never heard until today. I called them and they said they were gonna dismiss and Just give me a warning but the parking stuff there and there's no signs. There's no curbing around the park and

185
01:33:13,688 --> 01:33:35,457
except for one little section. They come by, there's commercial vehicles parked at night, which they go right by, they don't tag them. There's a dump truck that's parked constantly, either on Hancock Street, Brooks Park, or Main Street, with junk on it, and it sits there sometimes for a couple of days.

186
01:33:35,879 --> 01:33:58,373
He takes up two or three spots when he parks on Brooks Park, and I've told him many a times, he doesn't live there. He lives on Sylvan Street, two streets over his girlfriend. And it's becoming an issue, parking there. There's no signs posted. They gotta post something, put some curbing to warn people.

187
01:33:58,373 --> 01:34:27,348
That's it. Thank you. But your ticket was dismissed, correct? It was dismissed. They were sending me something in the mail saying it was dismissed. I called them because I hadn't heard anything. And the girl in the office, Brenda, said that it's the police department that's enforcing this, telling them to write the tickets, which I had talked to somebody in traffic, and he says, we have nothing to do with it. And he says, there's nothing posted there. He says, they have to post something. People have been parking there for 50 years, and they got a note.

188
01:34:27,348 --> 01:34:54,770
you know, put a sign and, you know, warn them. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. President. I've got a couple of questions for the gentleman. Excuse me, sir. Counselor Knight has a couple of questions for you. It's somewhat unrelated to the topic that you brought up, but we've had a number of resolutions that have gone forward from this council concerning Brooks Park and some illicit and what we call unsavory behavior going on down there behind the new apartment buildings and so on.

189
01:34:54,770 --> 01:35:23,558
The council's passed a number of resolutions and I might follow it up a little bit, but I'd like to hear from you as to what impact you've seen. Have you seen an improvement down there in the illicit activity that's going on in Brooks Park? Yeah, yeah. But I mean, something's got to be done with the, around that park. Put up curbing or something. Put up signs, because a lot of the people, they've been parking there for years. Put it up and, you know. So, but in terms of the bad element that's been in the neighborhood. The bad element?

190
01:35:23,558 --> 01:35:43,741
I really don't see much of that. There were people down in that parking lot that were talking about dealing drugs. I heard they were ordering pizzas to their cars. I haven't seen that lately. Aside from the uptick in the enforcement in the parking over there and some of the

191
01:35:44,332 --> 01:36:10,066
Communication issues that are going on everything in the neighborhood seems to be going well seems to be all right excellent. Thank you very much. Please come by Point of information counselor Dolo Russo president I want to point out that this council on two occasions in the past four years has requested that the administration install curbing in the area There was Kirby there at one time and it was and it was never replaced it was never replaced in the late great

192
01:36:11,112 --> 01:36:21,524
Sammy Petrella was a long-time advocate for that improvement. Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Appreciate it.

193
01:36:28,443 --> 01:36:56,692
Good evening. Name and address of the record, please. Good evening. My name is Claudio Iacono, former Medford. I live now in Reddick. I'm an HVAC technician, so I travel to the city of Medford doing service calls or whatever. Well, a little while back, I pulled up 7th Street, right in the intersection of Spring Street. I parked under a sign that says, 30 minutes free parking.

194
01:36:57,012 --> 01:37:20,131
I had to drop off a key to the real estate office across the street. I just saw I came back and said, take it out of my car. Okay. Two weeks later, I had to do the same thing, practice the same thing. This time, I'm smart. I go to the chaos machine, broken. They said, go to the next chaos machine. So I walked by the modern hardware, which is chaos machine.

195
01:37:20,722 --> 01:37:48,987
I went there, that's broken. So now I'm gonna move my car to my friend's building across the way, around the corner. Come back there, there's a ticket on my car. All right, so I went up to the main street, which I used to live right up the street from there many years ago. I asked the attendant, I says, I wanna appeal these tickets. She says, okay, it'll cost you $25 to appeal the ticket. So I give her $25 in cash.

196
01:37:49,375 --> 01:38:14,789
I got an application. They filled it all out. I haven't heard anything from it. But three weeks later, I got a notice. You read, I pay within seven days or we suspend your license or your registration. So I went back. I said to the lady there, can I have my $25 back if I pay for tickets? She says, no. I said, you mean to tell me you took $25 from me for an appeal?

197
01:38:15,346 --> 01:38:28,070
And now, you're not giving me a piano, you're giving me my money back. She says, no. She says, unless you pay this, we're going to suspend your license. I said, where's your manager? So she gave me her phone number. I called her for a week. Nothing.

198
01:38:28,576 --> 01:38:55,930
So I finally, you know, I said to myself, forget, give up. And then my friend there, a gentleman, we happened to have coffee, so he happened to mention about this. And there I am. You know, I work in Medford a lot, quite a bit. And it's very, very difficult. I have a commercial vehicle that I do a service call, which is like five minutes, 10 minutes. Now, I had pictures. I showed this gentleman at the,

199
01:38:56,825 --> 01:39:21,631
what they call the parking place there, where it says, 30 minutes free parking. I don't know what that means. Because then I got smart. So I parked my car in my friend's parking lot, you know, in the rear there on Salem Street. And I sat at Dunkin' Donuts and watched a guy, a lady, a poor little lady with a cane, from her car,

200
01:39:22,323 --> 01:39:46,859
to the chaos machine. He bought a ticket before he had the chance to put the money into the chaos machine. That's disgusting. Somebody should do something about it. Thank you. I appreciate it. Have a good night. I was just wondering if you had the dates as to when these tickets were issued.

201
01:39:47,888 --> 01:40:07,227
couple of months ago I I mean I can get you a date on the next meeting I have all the paperwork show me an email I'd like to be interested in like I said I in fact it was a surprise okay I can take a look at those I'd appreciate thank you thank you Scott Billy oh don't go away don't go away

202
01:40:08,662 --> 01:40:37,788
I should have never left metro. But I think that a lot of us have received some phone calls with these simple issues that are very big, and I think that this council has asked for meetings and we've had meetings with the republic pocket or have they changed their names again? So good. So the issues.

203
01:40:38,227 --> 01:40:57,970
I appreciate you coming up and talking about it because we've had a lot of concerns with, you know, I've had a person call that they got a ticket of 201 for blocking the sidewalk as they parked in the driveway. It's something that simple. So the understanding that our residents don't know what

204
01:40:58,477 --> 01:41:26,287
what's going on and when it's going on is very important that we meet again and really start pounding and putting some, you saw what had just happened when this council works together and putting restrictions and things happen. So I appreciate you coming out and sharing that because I think we need to do the same. So thank you very much. On that same point, Councilor Schapiro is right. And I think it was probably four months back where we were inundated with complaints.

205
01:41:26,573 --> 01:41:55,835
And we did sit down with Republic Park, and maybe this was around the same time that you were getting the tickets, about four or five months ago. And they had a whole new changeover in staff that wasn't trained properly. So we did meet with the head of the company that's in charge of this area, and he did reassure us. And we cracked the whip, and we asked the mayor to do the same. And since then, the complaints that I've received have slowed down tremendously. But there was a time frame, a couple months span, where we were getting

206
01:41:56,189 --> 01:42:01,117
I mean, a couple complaints a day, it seemed like, and it was just that the traffic was not trained properly, which.

207
01:42:01,387 --> 01:42:29,180
they need to get a handle on if they have another turnover. So, just letting you know, we did meet with the company. The only comments I have about this is if the machine is broken, two machines are broken, and you have a picture of them, because these iPhones, the best thing in the world, and you go up to someone in the office, should say, okay, where did it happen? What happened? I'm going to send someone to fix it.

208
01:42:29,180 --> 01:42:55,319
But when you walk into that office two or three times, I have nothing to do with this. Why are you here if you have nothing to do with this? See the city councilor. That's why I'm here. See the mayor. I mean, the mayor is busy. She has a lot to do. City councilor is busy. Someone should be in that office that can answer these questions. We'll go after it now. Mr. President?

209
01:42:55,758 --> 01:43:13,021
Vice President Mox. Just a quick question so I understand. You paid the $25 to have a hearing. Yes. Then you decided to pay the tickets and you didn't want the hearing. No, no, no. That's wrong. He was denied. I was not denied. I was never.

210
01:43:13,021 --> 01:43:27,162
never notified, but my next notification was if I don't pay $45 within seven days, I would have my license pulled away and my registration pulled away. But you never had a hearing. And they never gave me the money back.

211
01:43:29,592 --> 01:43:51,563
Mr. President, we should also request, Mr. President, that this gentleman get his money back, first of all. The $25 is for a hearing, if he never had a hearing. If you can get me the information, I would be happy to. I will. It's my counsel's will. I will, absolutely. If you give it to Ray, Ray will give it to me. I will, I will. It's my understanding, Mr. President, when these kiosks are not working,

212
01:43:51,563 --> 01:44:15,509
that they get an electronic message to their main office. So they know when these machines aren't working. So it's not even a matter of them going out or having a resident say they're not working. They know when they're malfunctioning and they should be out there immediately servicing these machines so residents don't have to walk 30, 40, 50 yards to get another kiosk, which is unacceptable in my opinion.

213
01:44:15,509 --> 01:44:33,346
So, if we can make that part of the report, too, Mr. President. What is the turnaround once they get notified of a kiosk that's malfunctioning? And please give that to Ray and let Ray give it to me. I appreciate it. It almost sounds like the gentleman received two tickets, right? You received one ticket.

214
01:44:33,346 --> 01:44:55,773
You received two tickets and you paid $25. The second one was almost on progress. The second one? I wanted to see what. So you came in there and you went and paid 25 bucks. I paid for both tickets. Oh, you paid for both tickets. I paid for both tickets. Okay, all right. It's sad because it almost sounded like you paid for one but not the other. No, no, no. When you went in there, you appealed one and paid for one. No. Plus I paid $25 for the appeal and I got the money back.

215
01:44:57,258 --> 01:45:23,009
All set? Thank you. Thank you. Have a good night. Thank you. Good luck. Thank you. Motion to receive and place on file, Mr. President. Mr. Scalpo has not completed his. He has one more thing to read. Real quick, real quick. Brianna, I'm going to blow your meeting out of the water that you had with the public. July 15th, a resident at Yale Street

216
01:45:23,718 --> 01:45:50,026
He purchased a vehicle, no he didn't purchase a vehicle, he changed his plates from one state to our state. Got his plates that day, put them on. At night, he got a ticket for an expired inspection sticker. Now, when you have new plates going on your vehicle, you have seven days to get your vehicle inspected.

217
01:45:50,431 --> 01:46:14,022
for what reason that they give these tickets out without knowing or I don't know if they have a program that they can reach into the registry to be able to see what the situation is. I mean, they shouldn't be just going and giving a ticket for an inspection sticker unless they know for sure that there's a valid reason to give that inspection sticker, a ticket.

218
01:46:15,001 --> 01:46:32,973
So this is what happened is that he, like I say, he purchased new plates. That evening, that same evening, he got a ticket for an inspection that wasn't valid. And like I say, he has 10 days to get that sticker. So of course, that cost him.

219
01:46:33,091 --> 01:46:51,856
I'm not even sure what the amount was. $25. Did he appeal? Did he appeal the ticket? Because obviously it was issued in violation of law. He has appealed the ticket, but he hasn't gotten a hearing. My question is that if they're going to be tagging for inspection stickers,

220
01:46:52,227 --> 01:47:14,772
stuff like that, they should be able to be in their computer, that they should be able to get to the registry to see if they can actually do this. If you could get me a copy of that one also, along with that other gentleman's, it would be appreciated and we'll bring it to the attention of park managers. Do you have it with you?

221
01:47:16,021 --> 01:47:44,185
No, I'll have to get it to you. If you can get it and give it to me, I'd appreciate it. And I think maybe it's time that we schedule another hearing, a meeting with the parking benefit people. That's my closing. My closing, if you don't mind, I'm requesting that the council have a public meeting and to have a representative of public parking to discuss these inconsistencies. And I think that would be a good idea to get the citizens involved in this. And then you're really going to see how inconsistent this is.

222
01:47:44,253 --> 01:47:59,255
Well, we've had a public meeting with them before, and as Councilor Longo said, tickets slowed down dramatically and a lot of things did get corrected. I think that was about six months ago? Less than that.

223
01:47:59,255 --> 01:48:19,538
Yeah, so maybe it's time we have another hearing with them. Again, it is a public hearing, and we can bring some other things to the attention. Mr. President, I think every meeting that we have is a public meeting. I mean, every meeting that the council has when we convene is a public meeting. And I think also that it's important to point out that

224
01:48:19,538 --> 01:48:37,662
oversight and the implementation of the traffic regulations falls under the jurisdiction and purview of the Traffic Commission and Republic can come all they want, but if the Traffic Commission is not on board as the oversight agency, then we quit talking to the DEFI as we're talking to the wall. This is under the purview of the Traffic Commission.

225
01:48:37,662 --> 01:48:57,237
This is something the Traffic Commission establishes. They've contracted out with an entity for parking management purposes and the purposes of the contract is to enforce the existing parking ordinances that are constructed through the Traffic and Parking Commission. So I think that if we're going to do anything that should be important that they're involved as well, Mr. President. And I can totally understand, however, you know, also

226
01:48:57,237 --> 01:49:24,743
looking at this thing on a citywide basis. There are inconsistencies, there's no question about it, but I think that we need to come up with a better solution than, you know, I have this ticket happen on this day at this place, this guy did this at this place. You know, that approach doesn't really bring us to a solution, Mr. President, and I think we need to come up with some solutions as to what it is that we need to do. And some of these things that are going on in the community have been what I would call

227
01:49:24,743 --> 01:49:49,752
laughable in moments, and you know what I mean, just wrong in others. And I've had good luck in speaking with Mr. Stackhouse and explaining the situations that are going on in the community. But part of the issue that I have, Mr. President, is that when we said let's bring parking into Medford, let's bring parking enforcement into Medford, that the focus was on freeing up spots in our central business districts to prevent people from other communities coming in here and taking up spots in our downtowns.

228
01:49:49,752 --> 01:50:11,926
And it's expanded upon that and I was a little bit more comfortable when the focus was on our business districts, not in our neighborhoods, not on streets that are dead ends, not on streets that have had families living on these streets for 30 and 40 years like Sylvia Road where they have individuals that have a system of how they park because they've all lived together and they're good neighbors and they know what's going on. So, they might block a driveway or they might park with two

229
01:50:11,926 --> 01:50:32,648
tires up on the curb so that cars can get by. Now the gentleman on Brookings Street, Brooks Parker, spoke about a commercial vehicle. Well, the guy lives on Sylvia Road. Well, that vehicle is off of Sylvia Road. Why was it off Sylvia Road? Because the neighbors went to him and said, you can't park your car here. It's a commercial plate. We can't get up and down the street. And they've policed themselves. And they've been able to do that successfully for a number of years. And we're coming into a situation now where

230
01:50:32,648 --> 01:50:55,210
I think Park Medford's focus is leaving the business districts and coming more towards the residential neighborhoods. And we need to really realign and refocus the direction that they're going in, because I don't think it's making the residents' quality of life any better. And I don't think that it's really meeting the objective and goal that was stated when it first came out. So I appreciate you taking the time to come up here, Mr. Scott, for all the work you put into doing it and investigating. Thank you. Thank you.

231
01:51:00,796 --> 01:51:25,265
Name and address of the record, please. David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road. I just want to touch base a little bit on this one situation. I have traveled just about every business district in Medford, as well as a lot of the residents, and I think that this is, I actually agree with Adam Knight that this is a systemic problem. This is not a singular problem in specific areas of the city.

232
01:51:25,265 --> 01:51:44,924
And what I mean by systemic is that I really firmly believe that it's time to take republic and kind of put their feet to the coals at this point and decide what it is that we want to do with this program. It does not behoove the city to not have somebody that's working with this program that doesn't have a vested interest in the city.

233
01:51:44,924 --> 01:52:04,567
And I think that's what's happening. On a customer service level I think what we've done is unfortunately we've made a lot of people unhappy whether they're traveling from downtown to downtown or even some of the businesses. I beg to differ in one area in the respect of talking to the business owners. If you talk to a lot of the business owners a lot of them will blame their

234
01:52:04,567 --> 01:52:32,562
current business status on the parking. And perceptions are realities. When someone's perception is that, you know, their business is down, that's their reality. And I think we have to take that into consideration. Number two, what we've also done in creating this situation, again, going back to Adam's, Councilor Knight's point, is that we've actually forced, yes, there are extra parking spaces in the downtown, but we've forced those commuters into the neighborhoods, even further in, deeper in.

235
01:52:32,562 --> 01:52:54,128
So it really hasn't helped. It's actually hurt tremendously. So it's either we put Republic on notice and let them know that this contract is not a contract that we're all excited about anymore, that we need to kind of put their feet to the fire and make something happen for the downtown communities, for the citizens, and allow them to be able to go in and out of their downtowns feeling good

236
01:52:54,128 --> 01:53:22,006
about what they want to accomplish. The kiosks, my personal opinion, do not work in downtowns. They just don't work. They're better in parking lots than the garages, but they're certainly not good on downtown streets. That's just my opinion, and I think it's time. I actually feel bad that the city council has to address all of these issues when it actually should be an in-house program for the city, created by the city, controlled by the city, not another outside entity. Thank you.

237
01:53:24,622 --> 01:53:43,859
Name and address of the Director of Police. Good evening. Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass. When Republic Parking first came in, I did a videotape to bring it to the attention of the public, and it never got on TV. Tonight, an elected official allegedly is parked in a fire lane, so I told Roy Belson,

238
01:53:44,450 --> 01:54:03,721
You know, if our elected officials are going to flagrantly violate the rules, why should the citizens pay for parking? It's a sin, it's a shame, and that individual should not be re-elected. Thank you.

239
01:54:04,784 --> 01:54:34,282
Councilor Falco, all in favor? Aye. Motion passes. 17606, petition for a sign denial reversal by Pastor Exeter Febrea for Evangelical Haitians Church of Somerville, 400 9th Street, Medford. OCD number 2017-4. Sign exceeds allowable space. I don't want that. Allowable space size.

240
01:54:37,960 --> 01:55:06,597
Is the petitioner here? Yes. Thank you. Good evening, everybody. Marie Wolverson, representing Pastor Fabian. He is not here and my colleague here, Mr. Ulrich German.

241
01:55:08,504 --> 01:55:35,707
I would like to first apologize. I believe that I was supposed to attend a meeting, the last meeting that you guys have, and I was overseas, and I came back and found a voicemail, and I wasn't even able to alert Pastor Fabio of the meeting because my phone was off, so I apologize if I have wasted anybody's time, but also

242
01:55:36,398 --> 01:55:54,674
I believe that you guys have met on the old denial sign as well, which I wasn't supposed to be on the table anymore, because I was told to sign.

243
01:55:56,227 --> 01:56:11,178
get started, start over on a new size, new pedestal, because the size of the sign was too big and the pedestal was too high the last time we met.

244
01:56:11,414 --> 01:56:26,467
So I went right back downstairs and talked to John Bavuzzo and we fill out a brand new application and started over. So I was waiting to hear from

245
01:56:26,467 --> 01:56:50,159
the city on either an approval or denial of that second application. So I haven't heard from any. I didn't hear from anyone. So we were just waiting to hear. So when I came back from vacation, I went back downstairs and find out, well, we had a denial the whole time. They just never told us, told the church about it. So that's the second.

246
01:56:50,159 --> 01:57:12,434
application that you guys have right now, the second denial that you guys have on the second size. As you can see, the pedestal of the new site is way down to the floor. It come from 3.6 inches to way down to one inch, and I believe that was one of the concern. The size went up, went down from 5 by 8 to 4 by 8.

247
01:57:12,434 --> 01:57:36,363
Point of information, if I can. The big issue was it was 11 feet, if you remember. It wasn't in inches. The sign was 5 by 8, which I think wasn't something that we had questioned about. The question we had that it rose to 11 feet. So now it's back down to the ground 5 by 8. Thank you.

248
01:57:37,038 --> 01:57:56,495
Do you have anything else to state? That's it. I'm sorry, was I talking too much? No, no, no. We're here to listen. Okay, no, I'm done. Counselor Knight. Mr. President, thank you very much and thank you very much for your patience going through the process. I know it can be a confusing and daunting task sometimes to get involved in government when you're not familiar with it.

249
01:57:56,495 --> 01:58:25,132
Ultimately, the sign was 11 feet tall when it was brought forward. They had a rendering of a gentleman that said it was six feet tall next to the guy that was assigned to him way over his head, so we all had a number of concerns about that. It's at the location of the church right next to the Brooks School, so there was some concerns about sight lines and visibility and whether or not it was gonna impact pedestrians and cars driving up the street and so forth. I think in our discussions, we said that we're not really opposed to the sign being five by eight, but based upon the rendering that we have here,

250
01:58:25,132 --> 01:58:46,225
confirmation and some assurances that, you know what I mean, it's going to be a little different. So this is something that I've been waiting to hear at the council floor since you came in for your first application. We went through the subcommittee process and the subcommittee did a great job on it. You know, and I certainly don't have a problem supporting the sign this evening and I'll move for approval, Mr. President. I second that. Motion on the floor for approval?

251
01:58:46,225 --> 01:59:15,976
Second. By Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor, motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Knight. I just have one question, this is not internally illuminated? This is not illuminated, right? It is an illuminated sign. It is illuminated? Yes, it always has been. I retract that. Okay, I don't recall, I don't see it in the fonts, logos, right now. It doesn't state it in the. It is if you look in the application.

252
01:59:16,668 --> 01:59:39,989
Okay, because what you gave to us doesn't state that it's illuminated. The application doesn't come before us. PVC and internal lighting. Yep. The original didn't have that. Yep, the first one was and the second one is as well.

253
01:59:41,018 --> 02:00:10,600
It's not being denied because of lighting. No, it was it wasn't. It was always size and height was always high. But this council has been on record for many other previous signs, in particular freestanding signs against the woman age, especially hours of operation. I mean, is there a recommendation with elimination? Just a question. Also want to occur through the chair. When will the elimination take place? Is it

254
02:00:10,600 --> 02:00:28,589
24, is it during the dark 24-7 or will it be shut off at 10 p.m.? No, just during daylight, just during, because we, pastor is going to be during church, during 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock in the morning.

255
02:00:28,589 --> 02:00:47,742
until 6 o'clock at night, we're off, we're done, because it's only for message during the day and during service hours, and then it's off again. So it's not going to be on at night at all. Oh, so it will be in service. Absolutely. It's just message during service. What pastor wants to do

256
02:00:47,742 --> 02:01:04,550
It doesn't want, we want to kind of offer a message to the community during service hours and during day. We don't want this to be like just solely a Haitian church. We just want to have services, second service, an English service offering

257
02:01:04,550 --> 02:01:27,837
We don't want the community to come in. We just want to put a message out there that they can come in for services during service hours, during Sundays. We don't want this to be so behavioral. That's it. We do not want this to be all night because that's electricity. And if you know my pastor, it will not happen. It will not have that electricity going in at night. It's not going to happen.

258
02:01:27,837 --> 02:01:57,470
Councilor Del Rosso. Mr. Chairman, both chairman of this meeting and all of the side committee. I offer a motion of approval for this. Looks Cholera. Thank you. So if I could make the condition, a portion of the sign is for messaging. Yes. So so you anticipate to have what a rotation of

259
02:01:57,959 --> 02:02:21,955
Yes, messaging is coming for Sunday service. This is a message that's going to, this is a message that's going to come in on Sunday. Please come in on Sunday for service at this hour, nine o'clock service. Sunday school starts. Just general message for people to come in on our Sunday school service. Are you aware of the current sign ordinance that regulates how often you can change a sign, the messaging on a sign?

260
02:02:22,630 --> 02:02:38,678
We don't, but my pastor is kind of not very technical savvy, so somebody is going to have to help him with that, so I'm pretty sure that, you know, one of us is going to have to help him, so that's probably not going to be. It's probably going to be.

261
02:02:39,050 --> 02:02:59,570
It's probably going to be on a rotation basis, whatever message that we put in. So, Councillor Wong-Tam. I think to clear it up, it's not going to be a scrolling message. It's going to be like one week it will say the X, the next week it will say something different. So, it's going to be something every 10 seconds. No. It's basically just really kind of like the message of Sunday.

262
02:02:59,570 --> 02:03:28,561
Sunday school mostly like Sunday school date of events Mostly, I mean we had an event on in September. We haven't had an event again since September So basically there wouldn't be anything to announce again until like every Sunday Sunday school. This is the schedule for Sunday We have a service once on Sunday So if we do decide to go with the English language service, so it's gonna be 9 o'clock and 12 o'clock This is the two service that we have

263
02:03:28,561 --> 02:03:50,026
And this is the messages that's going to be happening. So that's probably what we're going to be announcing. So it's not going to be — it's not a business, so I don't see the need to have tons of messages every single day going on on this thing. So on the week that we have revivals, which we have three times a year, revivals.

264
02:03:50,026 --> 02:04:10,698
We probably will have a message say this is what the message is going to be tonight and tomorrow There's gonna be another message every night. There's a there's gonna be service for revival seven days So every day there's gonna be a message for what the message is going to be tomorrow for revival So that's that type of stuff. So Council Scott Kelly again, I think this is why

265
02:04:10,698 --> 02:04:28,518
having that subcommittee. That meeting is so important. I'm spinning right now. I'll be honest with you. I'm trying to gauge. So the conversation would have been understanding what the ordinance is so you understood. The more in-depth conversation would

266
02:04:28,518 --> 02:04:47,317
would have been the acceptance of the size of the sign. If it's illuminated, would we accept it? So I don't know. I look for guides from my senior colleague on this committee. Councilor Falco has a thought.

267
02:04:47,705 --> 02:05:14,030
Is that the actual section that has the message piece? Yeah, so the top part is going to be the logo of the church. That's not going to be illuminated at all. That would cost the church way too much money. It's just literally down in the bottom. Just that revival piece. That's it. I'm just trying to look at the sketch here. Is that three feet?

268
02:05:15,700 --> 02:05:20,594
It says you have one here and then four. Is that three feet of?

269
02:05:21,016 --> 02:05:49,670
This here, is that? It's like probably two feet worth of. Is it two feet? Yeah, that's about like maybe. Three feet of messaging? Two feet? That's about two feet. So it's about two feet of messaging? That's a lot less. It looks like that's a foot there, so two, three, four, that's three feet of messaging. This one is the pedestal. That's the pedestal. Okay, so that takes you a foot out. Yeah, that's the pedestal. So one to four. No, no, no, the whole width is four.

270
02:05:49,906 --> 02:06:16,400
All the way to the top is four. Yeah, the whole thing is four. So that's half of it, it's two feet. Oh, okay, so that's two feet, okay, okay. I thought there was a line there, I'm sorry, it's my mistake. So two feet is going to be. So two feet, so it'll become almost like a mini movie screen almost? Yeah, that's it, yeah. No. No, because if you, that's actually. It's four. Oh yeah, yeah. The top part of it is going to be the logo and then it's going to be the Evangelical Haitian Church, so that's just basically paper.

271
02:06:16,754 --> 02:06:37,797
That's not going to be illuminated. It's just the bottom part of it. That's it. That's going to have to be the message of the day. I mean, Councilman, I might have a resolution, but I think maybe that's what I'm aiming for. Councilman? I personally, Mr. President, have lived next to churches and across from churches with my address on High Street where I have two churches that are right next to me.

272
02:06:38,354 --> 02:06:50,217
One church has a sign and one church doesn't. The church that has a sign that's in nonconformity with our sign ordinance always has a message posted on it. The church that doesn't have a sign,

273
02:06:51,027 --> 02:07:11,868
Instead puts two stakes out there and puts a banner out there and they change the banner from time to time and it looks awful. It looks absolutely terrible. It's an eyesore to the neighborhood really. And I think that, you know, this isn't going to be harmful provided that we can put some restrictions on it. It's a special permit request. They're asking us to issue a special permit and we have some concerns about internal illumination.

274
02:07:11,868 --> 02:07:28,338
Assuming that the concerns of my counselors have about internal illumination are that they don't want it lighting up the sky at night So we can put restrictions on it eight o'clock nine o'clock ten o'clock Whatever it is that we feel comfortable And we can also put restrictions on it if we approve the side to say that they won't put any hang any banners or any other

275
02:07:28,338 --> 02:07:48,470
type of materials in the front lawn, so ultimately we'll have a clean, crisp look. It may be a little bit bigger than we're used to, but at least we're still protecting the quality of life in the neighborhood, because I think a big sign that's lit up, that's controlled in the certain hours that it's controlled to be litting up is much better for the neighborhood than two posts that are stuck up there with an old sign that's hanging down the middle, and then it gets changed every three days, and it flaps in the wind, and it looks terrible.

276
02:07:48,470 --> 02:08:05,193
So I'm inclined this evening, Mr. President, to support the petition as filed. However, I know that my colleagues have concerns and I want to be a part of coming up with a solution that we can all have by putting our heads together. And I think that putting restrictions on the application would probably be a solution that could kind of satisfy everybody behind the rail.

277
02:08:05,530 --> 02:08:33,222
My recommendation as chairman of the committee would be, because it's a freestanding sign, because it's internally illuminated, because it involves movement, I think it merits a subcommittee meeting. We can get one within the next week and a half, two weeks, very soon. We had one already that I know you were out of town and couldn't attend. So that would be my recommendation to this body that we meet in subcommittee just to iron out and put forward the best proposal.

278
02:08:33,222 --> 02:08:49,793
Yeah, I too, I wouldn't, I just think, I concur with Councilor Knight putting some restrictions, but I think that has to be done in subcommittee. So again, I support the subcommittee, moving this to subcommittee and doing it relatively soon.

279
02:08:50,114 --> 02:09:06,854
which we can move pretty quickly, but I think we need that. Thank you. Mr. President, I withdraw my motion for approval and second the motion that this be sent to the subcommittee on science, et cetera.

280
02:09:09,014 --> 02:09:36,385
I don't want to have a second, but second, I don't want to have a second by Councilor Scott Pelly. All in favor. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye. Aye

281
02:09:37,432 --> 02:10:01,259
Thank you. If we can, I don't know if we're still in suspension of the rules. We are still in suspension of the rules. If we can go to a paper in the committee to have friends from Wegmans, if we can follow them up. Do you want to report it out if we can, please? Yes, we can.

282
02:10:01,597 --> 02:10:30,757
Mr. Marks is the chairman of that committee? Mr. Chairman was absent. Chairman and Mr. Councillor Scott, if you could report that out please. I did. I sat as chair in that subcommittee prior to our meeting and if we can. I'm in the right direction.

283
02:10:31,330 --> 02:10:34,283
of women's science going on here.

284
02:10:37,000 --> 02:11:06,852
We took up the sign. The issue was for the liquor, wine and beer sign that was tabled and moved to subcommittee. We voted in two in favor to move that paper forward in approval. So we now open it to the floor.

285
02:11:06,852 --> 02:11:34,797
I second that. OK. On the motion to accept the committee report. It will be accepted by Councilor Scott Pelly, seconded by Councilor Alonzo Kern. All those in favor? Aye. Motion passes. Is the paper on the committee? Has the paper come off the floor? Has the paper come off the floor to approve it? We just adopted it. We just adopted it? Yes.

286
02:11:37,497 --> 02:11:55,047
Motion by Councilor DelaRusso to revert back to regular business. Aye. All in favor, aye. Okay. 17, 595.

287
02:11:55,368 --> 02:12:20,512
offered by Councilor Knight being resolved that the administration provide the following to the Council. One, a list of all C-Click fix complaints made regarding the operation of Stone and Skillet located at 186 Winthrop Street. Two, a list of all complaints made to the Code Enforcement Officer made regarding the operation of Stone and Skillet located at 186 Winthrop Street.

288
02:12:20,512 --> 02:12:45,892
3. A list of all code violations issued to Stone and Skillett located at 186 Winthrop Street. 4. A list of complaints made to the Board of Health regarding the operation of Stone and Skillett located at 186 Winthrop Street. 5. A list of all complaints made to the Police Department and Traffic Commission regarding the operation of Stone and Skillett located at 186 Winthrop Street. 6.

289
02:12:45,892 --> 02:13:09,685
A list of all permits, licenses, or similar documents issued by the City of Medford to the entity known as Stone and Skillett 186 Winter Street. Councilor Knight. Move approval, Mr. President. No, table it and allow him to speak when he gets back. Okay, if we could table that until Councilor Knight gets back. All those in favor? Aye. Motion passes.

290
02:13:10,242 --> 02:13:16,790
17-596 offered by Councilor Langel-Kern. Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council is presented with a potential.

291
02:13:17,380 --> 02:13:43,064
expenditure bond requests with our bond requests. We are also presented with an itemized breakdown of how the money will be spent. Be it further resolved that we be that we be provided with the information at least one week prior to the City Council meeting rather than in the night before being told it's an emergency. Councilor Langel-Kern. Thank you, President Carviello. This sparked off of our July meeting, I believe.

292
02:13:43,435 --> 02:13:58,690
We were here about 5-ish in the evening and our meeting went until about 12, 12.30 in the morning. And one of the last agenda items was an expenditure of $4.5 million.

293
02:13:59,517 --> 02:14:25,943
I just wanted to, you know, we did vote for it, but I woke up the next morning. I voiced my frustration with regards to a lack of a breakdown of that money, and then I woke up the next morning and I, you know, was a little frustrated. My frustration continued. So I did email finance department, treasurer's department with all my additional questions, and I did eventually get the answers I wanted.

294
02:14:26,281 --> 02:14:53,095
It was a project that obviously needs to be done, but I just wanted to make a point to put it on the agenda to let people know that I was frustrated. We were given, again, $4.5 million. We were given an explanation, besides a couple of lines in our agenda, we were given a four or five page explanation of the project broken down by individual street the night of our meeting.

295
02:14:53,332 --> 02:15:20,433
So when we notice it, it all depends on when we read additional information that's on our desk. I was paying attention to the meeting and I didn't see it until it was actually before us. Scrambling to read it the night of a meeting at 11.30, 12 o'clock at night, it's difficult. Lights were beaming on us and we were tired and it's some information that I would expect to receive at least

296
02:15:20,686 --> 02:15:48,530
a week prior to a vote of such magnitude. So I wanted to get a vote by the council. And to continue with that, the explanation didn't have a breakdown of the money. It was broken down two different ways how we were going to get the money, but it wasn't broken down by street. Thankfully, I got it the next day, but I would just like to request that the administration provides us

297
02:15:49,103 --> 02:16:10,822
You know, we always talk about transparency. I just would like that we be provided information on expenditures a week prior to the meeting. That it be something, you know, we stuck strong tonight and we obviously hopefully will create some change going down the line on trench work and road work within our city. We stuck strong and had parking enforcement.

298
02:16:12,357 --> 02:16:39,458
a few months ago, and we made significant changes. I think we need to stick together as a body and say to our administration, we need information before it is presented on our council agenda. We should not be given information on a project, on an expenditure, on a bond request, the night of our meeting, at 7 o'clock at night. It should be weeks, if not days, before our meeting. And that expenditure should be broken down in detail.

299
02:16:39,610 --> 02:16:53,347
And that's something that wasn't done for us. And it's something we're, as a body, not mandating. And I think I'd like to take a vote tonight that we request and mandate that we be given an explanation and a

300
02:16:53,701 --> 02:17:15,908
expenditure breakdown seven days prior to our meeting and make a change and all stick together and try to be able to, I mean, it's very frustrating when you know, oh, the next day somebody is going to be asking you questions about it and you don't have it. You don't have the information of how much money is going to go to Paris Street, how much money is going to go to Evans Street. We didn't know that. We voted for it. It was very late.

301
02:17:15,908 --> 02:17:37,070
And that's the way it happened, but I think going forward, we owe it to the taxpayers of this community to get information prior to taking such serious votes. So I'd ask for a roll call vote on this and hopefully we can stick together and make a stand. Thank you. On the motion by Councilor Langel-Kern. Did you want to speak?

302
02:17:39,702 --> 02:18:07,073
Name and address of the record, please. Thank you, Mr. President. Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street. This is a fraud. This kind of pertains to what Councilor Brianna Longo Kern is talking about, but I had to leave that meeting that night. Now, with the breakdown of that money, can I ask, was Evans Street a part of that? Councilor Longo Kern?

303
02:18:08,339 --> 02:18:34,698
I'll forward you the breakdown. It was a page or two. I don't believe it was. From what I heard, what happened was, after being told the street was going to be fixed this year, it's not. This year. That's true. That's right. Mr. President, I think you may be correct. And the street was not included in that expenditure request that came forward as being funded through another

304
02:18:34,698 --> 02:19:02,693
process, and from what I understand, now, I'm pretty frustrated about the 7th Street thing, too. You know, we're looking at this 24, maybe 36 months now. It's been going on. You know, it's going out to bid. It's going to be out to bid in May. Well, the bid never got awarded in May. Then, you know, work's going to start, you know, May, June. Well, now it's August. Work still hasn't started. So I'm a little frustrated with the situation as well. But the answer to your question, no, it wasn't included in that. It's being funded through a different mechanism and a

305
02:19:03,048 --> 02:19:31,212
Well, I have it in front of me just to go through the through the list. Grove Street and Linden Street, new water mains, 830,000. Power Street and Pinkert Street, new water mains, 790,000. Hydraulic model citywide, 30,000. Water meters, 150,000. MTU, 75,000. 225, project is 350 in the 125 in enterprise budget. Private lead service replacement was 200,000.

306
02:19:31,617 --> 02:19:55,208
It goes into more detail, and then it says the contract is broken down as follows. Year one, $1,298,445.09, water service and water main replacement as followed, and then Evans Street is listed under water main replacement. So there's no construction of the road within this, but Evans Street, they do plan on. This year?

307
02:19:56,542 --> 02:20:22,917
year one of the contract, so I think that would be 2017, beginning of 2018, if I can recall. So how are they going to do that work in the winter? Exactly. And how can you say that they're going to do water main repair without, I mean, to get to the water main, you have to dig up the street, so obviously. That's why they have to resurface the street, because they want to dig it up to make the water main surface. That was always the plan, we were just hoping it would be repaved by now.

308
02:20:23,255 --> 02:20:38,257
What happened was the contract got awarded, Mr. Capucci, and then when the engineering department said that these should construction schedule new construction criteria, they said we can't meet those criteria, so you have to re-bid the construction. So they backed out of the deal after they were awarded the contract.

309
02:20:38,257 --> 02:20:59,992
But from what I understand, they weren't one of the preferred vendors that the city uses anyhow, so the product that they put out isn't necessarily one of the better ones. But based upon the public bid laws, that's who we were stuck with. So although it's been taking a long time, the delay may be a blessing because from what I understand, the workmanship of that entity isn't necessarily the best of the best. I don't know about it.

310
02:20:59,992 --> 02:21:17,963
It being a blessing, Councilor Knight, the residents on my street, knowing that I come to a lot of the city council meetings, they have been asking me for months now. Mr. Cappuccio, I'm in full agreement with the residents on your street that know that I come to a lot of city council meetings, too. Call me and say the same thing. Right. I do not.

311
02:21:17,963 --> 02:21:46,111
I do not hold this council accountable for the street and road repair on Memphis Street pertaining to this year. It's been decades since the street has been serviced. I speak tonight in favor of Councilor Longo Kern's resolution to have the specificities on future appropriations outlined because

312
02:21:46,111 --> 02:22:15,727
The administration put out a letter that in good faith these councillors looked at and then notified the residents on my street, who for years have been wanting Evans Street to be fixed. And I think it was appropriate for you to do so. But then along the chain of departments that it has to go through, the engineer's office, the purchaser's office, then out for bids, then back to the mayor to choose the bids.

313
02:22:16,975 --> 02:22:42,946
It was a serious ball dropped. I wish the residents on my street weren't told that it was going to be done in May. But I hope that you stand resolved to hold whatever administration is in power to doing simple things like street and road repair, especially when it's gone for decades neglected.

314
02:22:42,946 --> 02:22:58,538
In a city that through different accounts I mean I sat through all the subcommittee meetings on on the budget and I see how expenditures not paid get thrown back into the general fund to where it's now ballooned into tens of millions of dollars and

315
02:22:58,538 --> 02:23:17,202
and to tell any resident of it, the people that came up before on brokers or curbs, go up Adam Street on the hillside, go on any street up in the heights. For this city to be sitting on so much money in simple things like road repairs, I'm thinking done, it's done.

316
02:23:19,126 --> 02:23:30,567
It's a little disheartening for lack of a better term. I hope that you all vote in the affirmative on Councilor Brianna Longo's current excellent resolution. Thank you. Thank you.

317
02:23:32,120 --> 02:23:56,842
Name and address of the record, please. Dave McKillop, 94 Rockland Road. I think this just goes back to a testament of having a yearly comprehensive strategic plan in place for these processes. To actually sit down and actually have to vote on something at midnight on something that needs to be acted on relatively quick is absurd. It makes no sense for a city to work that way.

318
02:23:56,842 --> 02:24:26,828
when you want to sit down and come up with a comprehensive plan for the following year, that discussion should have already taken place in the month of August. It should already be ready for the following year as to what we are going to do as a city and what actions we are going to take and what monies we need to do that. That is a proactive plan. And I think that, you know, Councilor Cohen's suggestion to at least have seven days is admirable, but I think it really has to be something that the council should really come together on

319
02:24:26,828 --> 02:24:55,803
team spirit wise and say hey, from this point on, we will not accept anything that isn't a comprehensive plan that gives the city and the budget enough time to plan for this and move forward and feel comfortable that it can be done and can be done on a timely basis so the citizens can feel good about the projects that are in front of them. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. On the motion by Councilor Lococo. Through the Chair, just my last vote, my last point, I do ask for the support on this.

320
02:24:56,427 --> 02:25:19,158
Having been frustrated and emailed the administration the next day, I received a detailed breakdown by I think it was 1.05 p.m. So there's no reason why we shouldn't be provided a breakdown of expenditures prior to our meeting. I just think it's a lack of respect and I think that needs to change.

321
02:25:19,343 --> 02:25:38,108
Thank you.

322
02:25:38,108 --> 02:25:59,523
present expenditures to us with no supporting documentation and either the council may or may not support it and In my opinion, I know what you're trying to get at through this resolution, but all it is is a request Madam mayor, will you please give us supporting documentation when you ask for expenditure now? She could say okay. I'll take that under advisement

323
02:26:00,029 --> 02:26:14,812
The bigger issue that we have as a council is our council rules. We have a council rule that states any request of expenditure only needs one member of the city council to stand up and say, you know what?

324
02:26:14,896 --> 02:26:32,716
I want this tabled. You don't need a vote of the council. It's one member of the city council saying, I need this tabled, and it gets tabled automatically. And that's our check and balance. So when something's presented to us and you feel there's not enough information, you evoke the council rule.

325
02:26:33,239 --> 02:26:56,780
that would request that it be laid on the table. And there's no vote on it. It's automatic. So I would state that we do have options out there. And a request to the mayor now is great. And if the mayor starts adhering to that, super. But I wouldn't put all my eggs in that basket. I think we as a council have to use the remedies that we have. And one of them is our own council rules.

326
02:26:56,780 --> 02:27:21,232
So, I would highly recommend to my council colleagues that if there is expenditure and you feel that there's not an appropriate amount of time or information, that that rule be evoked and automatically gets laid at least for one week so we can get additional documentation. I will support the paper tonight in principle, but I really don't think it has any teeth. But I'll support it in principle. Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

327
02:27:21,232 --> 02:27:45,160
Councilor Galarruso. I agree with Councilor Marks on the matter. In fact, with the way the resolution is written, I don't even know who it's addressed for to. So thank you, Mr. President. Thank you. Councilor Layton. I think Councilor Marks is on the right track, Mr. President. I think it's, you know, council rules can dictate whether or not this is something that we can handle ourselves without having to make a request to the mayor.

328
02:27:45,160 --> 02:28:14,945
Also, if we look in our council rules, it says every ordinance and every order for a bond issue shall before its passage be referred to the solicitor who shall forthwith examine its legality and respond back to the council in writing thereof. Rule 22. So, you know, there are a couple of remedies in there for us to take. And I think that we should just do them ourselves as opposed to kicking it across the hallway. We've voted on this in the past. I've supported this measure in the past, Mr. President. Some of the frustrations that my councilors share,

329
02:28:14,945 --> 02:28:41,084
I don't see as much of a, I have a strong working relationship with the administration, past and present. I pick up the phone when I get my agenda and I talk about issues that I have questions on. But maybe some people don't have that type of access, I don't know. I do the best I can to get the information and be prepared for the meeting. But I think that our council rules could really dictate what direction that we can go in and how we can police this ourselves as opposed to relying on someone else to do it. But it's something I've supported in the past, I certainly have, but this evening I won't be.

330
02:28:41,371 --> 02:28:53,774
Thank you, Councilor Naito. On the motion by Councilor Mango-Curran, it's getting late. Seconded by Councilor Del Rosso.

331
02:28:54,280 --> 02:29:18,209
Thank you, Mr. President. Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street. Just really brief, I completely understand what Councilor Marks is saying, but on the flip side, what Councilor Longo Kern is saying is the presentation of these appropriations coming in as dire and needed and at the last minute to invoke that

332
02:29:18,209 --> 02:29:31,439
It's it's almost it's almost like sets up the council to look bad. It's it's I think it's quite frankly the

333
02:29:32,789 --> 02:29:58,270
item doesn't have to make the agenda if we don't have the information that we need. Just because the mayor sends a paper and says, put this on the agenda, it doesn't have to happen the next week. We control our own agenda. We control when the items and matters come up. So if we get a paper that says, put this on the agenda, we say, well, let's talk about the council, but when do we want to put this on the agenda? Maybe we have six papers that are coming up for bonds. And let's talk about bonding for a whole meeting and have a universal picture of what's going on in the city of Medford in terms of bonding instead of doing it

334
02:29:58,270 --> 02:30:28,257
play and connect the dots. So, you know, there's different ways that we can handle this. The question. Right. I understand that Council of Councilor Knight, but when they do come up at the midnight hour, I, I don't think that this resolution lacks teeth. I think what Councilor Lungo-Kern is doing astutely is sending a message not only to the mayor, but a separate message to the people that you guys represent, that we are going to do something about

335
02:30:28,257 --> 02:30:52,034
your taxpayer dollars. Thank you. Thank you. On the motion by Councilor Longo-Curran, seconded by DelaRusso. A roll call vote has been requested. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. Councilor DelaRusso? No. Councilor Falco? Yes. Councilor Nye? No. Councilor Longo-Curran? Yes. Vice President Marx? Yes. Councilor Scott Pelli? Yes. President Caviello? Yes.

336
02:30:53,806 --> 02:31:03,678
5 in the affirmative, 2 in the negative, motion passes. Motion to revert back to 17-595. It's council at night.

337
02:31:04,184 --> 02:31:26,341
Thank you, Mr. President. Stone and Skillet. Yes, Stone and Skillet, Mr. President, is located on the corner of West and Winthrop. It is a bakery wholesaler that over the past several months has not been the greatest of neighbors, Mr. President. I've received a number of complaints from area residents concerning their hours of operation, the cleanliness of the facility.

338
02:31:26,341 --> 02:31:50,067
and some parking concerns that they have. Ultimately, this bakery wholesaler has operated in excess of our hours of operation. They're permitted to operate from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. Between May 1st and June 22nd, I personally reported 16 violations of operation after hours.

339
02:31:50,067 --> 02:32:12,916
This coupled with the fact that there's a dedicated parking spot beside the building for 30 minute parking which has turned into stone and skillets personal loading zone for their renter car, renter truck, 18 wheeler that sits there for 7 to 8 to 9 to 10 hours a day without moving. The facility and the grounds around it are in deplorable condition, Mr. President.

340
02:32:12,916 --> 02:32:36,153
And I'm asking for these materials so that we can move forward and investigate whether or not there's anything that we can do to designate them as a public nuisance and move them out of the neighborhood. So it's been brought to my attention in recent weeks since I filed this resolution that a gigantic for rent sign has been placed on the side of the building which would lead me to believe that Stone and Skillet is on their way out of the community.

341
02:32:36,153 --> 02:33:03,878
The bakery wholesale does not fall under the jurisdiction by state law of our local Board of Health. They're controlled by the state Board of Health. So we have very limited recourse concerning our concerns about the cleanliness of the facility and what's going on around it. However, with this good news coming forward that they are putting the place up for rent, I'd still ask the paper to move forward and for us to be prepared, because they said they were gonna move last year, they said they were gonna move the year before that, and they haven't, Mr. President. They've certainly outgrown this facility.

342
02:33:03,878 --> 02:33:29,798
And I think it's time that they find a new location. Whether that location is in the city of Medford or somewhere else is to be determined, Mr. President, but right now I think that these residents have been subjected to enough quality of life issues down there that the benefits that Stone and Skill are bringing to the community are lacking and the impact on the quality of life that they have is major. And for that reason, I bring this resolution forward and ask my council colleagues to support it.

343
02:33:29,967 --> 02:33:51,466
Thank you. On the motion by Councilor Nice, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso. All those in favor? Aye. Motion passes. 17-597, offered by Councilor Locario, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council set up a Committee of the Whole meeting on the 19th or the 26th of September to discuss and review a potential new ordinance

344
02:33:52,327 --> 02:34:21,723
to help remedy level three gas leaks within Medford. Councilor Longo, if you're in. Thank you, President Carviello. A few months ago, well, not even, I don't think, probably June, I brought up a City of Boston ordinance that was regarding gas leaks, level three gas leaks. And the City of Boston is taking measures to hold the utility companies accountable and to remedy those gas leaks.

345
02:34:22,060 --> 02:34:51,575
in-depth ordinance. I did forward it to the city clerk who I then saw forwarded it to the rest of my colleagues. So this is almost just a reminder to maybe hopefully take a read and we can do something about it. This issue was brought to me by a citizen who probably is going to speak on it, Mr. Tudin. And I think it was led in Boston by a group of moms who are trying to prevent gas leaks because of all the damage they do to you can... The gas bill? The gas bill, number one. But it's a safety issue and it

346
02:34:51,878 --> 02:35:20,718
wildlife and the environment, it's not a good thing and we'd like to see what they're doing, read about it and hopefully craft our own ordinance to accommodate our needs and hopefully get the city engineer on board and give her a tool to make sure that when a street is dug up, gas leaks are looked into and fixed. So I would hope that we can review and come up with an ordinance sometime in September so we can move approval on this.

347
02:35:20,887 --> 02:35:49,810
Councilor DelaRusso. President, we have a paper from the mayor tonight that I think addresses part of this issue, Mr. President, that is being taken up by the State House to address it on a state level by creating an act relative to protecting consumers of gas and electricity from paying for leaks on unaccounted gas, which will of course force

348
02:35:50,671 --> 02:36:08,002
the gas company to deal with leaks because it gets them where it counts, in their pocketbooks, because that's what it's all about. Mr. President, I don't know if this has to go to Committee of the Whole. I would think that procedurally the best thing to do would be to send this to the Committee on Ordinances.

349
02:36:08,002 --> 02:36:28,775
to review the draft of the Bardston ordinance to ask the city solicitor to be in attendance at that meeting to add his expert legal advice and then report it out as is often outlined by the proper procedure by Councillor Knight. Councillor Langlois-Carrion, would you prefer this go to the subcommittee and audiences?

350
02:36:28,994 --> 02:36:50,662
I think it's a good ordinance the way Boston has it written. I think it just requires a review, and the city solicitors sit with us as an entire body, which is going to end up in Committee of the Whole anyway. I don't think it has to be redrafted in much a way. I think Committee of the Whole meeting would be preferable to move it forward quicker rather than take months and months to

351
02:36:51,100 --> 02:37:20,345
get two meetings set up. I think we can do it in one meeting. On the motion by Councilor Lara Curran to have a Committee of the Whole meeting on the 19th and 26th of September, seconded by Councilor Falco. All those in favor? Aye. Motion passed. Mock Councilor Del Rosso in opposition. Also Mr. President. Sorry? I'd like to be mocked in opposition. And also Councilor Knight. I'll do my best. We'll see what's on the calendar for the 19th and 26th. And I think somebody might want to speak on it.

352
02:37:20,750 --> 02:37:23,399
Yeah, just real quick. I've been disposed of.

353
02:37:24,496 --> 02:37:52,171
Hi, I'm Curtis Student, 340 High Street, Medford, Massachusetts. I just wanted to invite the council to a meeting on August 22nd, which is of the 350 Massachusetts Mystic Valley organization that has been dedicated to looking at this gas leak issue. We're going to have a meeting specifically about level three gas leaks in Medford, so if any counselor or any resident of Medford doesn't want to wait until September to learn more about it, they're welcome to come to a meeting here at Medford High School, 7 o'clock, and you'll

354
02:37:52,171 --> 02:37:57,352
learn everything you need to know about the issue. So I just wanted to make sure people were aware of that meeting. Thank you. Thank you for that information.

355
02:37:58,263 --> 02:38:25,415
17-598, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Director of Purchasing provide the City of Memphis Council with an update on the implementation of the Wage Theft Ordinance, and be it further resolved that the Director of Purchasing provide the City, provide the Council with a list of all vendors awarded contracts for fiscal year 2017 and 2018. Councilor Knight. Mr. President, thank you very much.

356
02:38:25,415 --> 02:38:50,339
Back a few months ago this council passed a wage theft ordinance, and a wage theft ordinance is designed to ensure that taxpayer dollars that are being paid to public contractors are then passed on to their employees pursuant to the public wage laws. What happens a lot of times in these instances is an individual that works for a private contractor that lays pipe, for example, with all these groups that we had this evening, that's working on a public works project laying pipe,

357
02:38:50,609 --> 02:39:06,877
is going to have to be compensated at the prevailing wage rates established by the Department of Industry. And a lot of times what happens is when a private contractor gets a public contract, they continue to pay their employees at a rate that's far less than the prevailing wage rate, and then they pocket the difference.

358
02:39:06,877 --> 02:39:36,863
And the laws are clear in what they call for. They call for individuals working on a public work project to be compensated at the prevailing wage rate. Taxpayer dollars are being funneled away from workers and being funneled into the pockets of profiteers. So we passed the wage theft ordinance, Mr. President. Part of the wage theft ordinance called for the city to examine whether or not any of the existing contracts have been included on the disbarment list at the Attorney General's office or found in violation of any wage and hour laws that are established at the state and federal levels.

359
02:39:36,863 --> 02:40:00,488
ordinance is now up and running and in effect, Mr. President, I'd just like to get a report back from the administration as to what steps they're taking to implement and whether or not any of the contractors that we've awarded contracts to have actually been found in violation of any of the state of federal wage laws or have been included on the state disbarment list so that they're exempt and precluded from bidding on future public works projects, Mr. President. Thank you, Councilor Knight.

360
02:40:03,880 --> 02:40:20,941
Name and address of the record, please. David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road. My question to Councilor Knight is, does this also include, in the initial part of it, when they actually put the bid out, they usually put in a labor amount. That labor amount could be ballooned.

361
02:40:20,941 --> 02:40:45,258
In the respect of an hourly versus an hourly wage, so it I'm not sure if a contractor city contract is the same But in general contracts when contractors come out and they do work The labor amount is based off of what they're charging for a labor amount some some places could charge 45 some places could charge 75 Some places could charge $80 per hour. It's irrelevant to actually what they're paying the employees Does that also encompass that?

362
02:40:45,393 --> 02:41:14,435
The Wage Theft Act just ensures compliance with the existing wage and hour laws. And it requires the applicant for the public bid to make certain disclosures to the community so that if in fact they are found in violation, then they have to take certain steps to ensure that if a complaint is brought forward to them, that they have bonded funds that are available to cover the payroll if in fact they have funneled or diverted this money from the worker and into the coffers of the business.

363
02:41:14,435 --> 02:41:43,983
So it doesn't really necessarily speak to the actual total amount of the bid. What it does is say if you have seven people that are designated as a municipal street sweeper, you need to pay the municipal street sweeper rate of $37 an hour for the hours that they work on the contract. And you're gonna work the contract for this many hours, so that's the rate that you have to pay them. And the rate's established by state law, by the Department of Land and Insurance. So that protects the actual employee. That protects the employee from having to wait. It does not protect the city from a ballooned rate.

364
02:41:44,303 --> 02:42:11,860
Well, the rates are established through the Department of Labor and Industries based upon the region that you're in. For the employees. For the workers. I'm talking about the actual bid itself. Well, the bid process is the... There's nothing in there that would actually help. Right, the public bid laws are relatively specific, and the city's ability to go and put restrictions in that would exceed the requirements that are established by state or federal law is not available to us. Okay, that's what I understand. Yeah. All right, so in other words, we couldn't come in and say, you cannot go any further than 15% above the actual rate that you're paying per employee.

365
02:42:11,860 --> 02:42:40,480
So basically that's where the companies would actually take the additional amounts and funds as opposed to the areas. Or say you work a 40 hour work week, but you really worked a 60 hour work week and they paid you 40 hours at straight time and then the 20 hours under the table. Or say that you worked a 40 hour work week, a straight 40 hour work week and they only paid you at your previous rate from the job that you were working on a public work project and that rate is

366
02:42:40,733 --> 02:42:57,203
50% less than what you should be making when you're working on the public work project. I think that that's some of the ‑‑ it's really an effort and attempt to get some of these unsavory contractors that do business in municipalities out. I guess the reason why I make that point is because if they're being

367
02:42:57,203 --> 02:43:20,204
enforced, which is great, and it's an absolutely important point, then the contractor themselves will find their way to make their money anyway, and that's kind of where they're going to find their way, is the labor ballooning actually in the first part. Well, the thing that they like to say in the industry, which would be called the change order, I believe they call it. I think that's a code for more money. Thank you.

368
02:43:20,609 --> 02:43:41,551
Thank you. On the motion by Councilor Nye, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso. All those in favor? Aye. Suspension of the rules. Suspension of the rules by Councilor Alango-Kern. Just to allow a citizen to speak. Opposed, Mr. President? Second. Do noted. Name and address of the record, please.

369
02:43:42,783 --> 02:44:06,374
First of all, I want to say thank you to all of you, and I know it's been a long evening, so I will not try to take up too much of your time. But I did want to address the councils. On Friday, August 11, the incumbents and the candidates for the Memphis City Council were invited to

370
02:44:06,374 --> 02:44:29,257
present or be present to witness the city clerk and three members of the Registrars of Voters Department draw the names of the primary election ballot to be held on September 12 while we were all together all Candidates had agreed and signed a letter addressed to the City Council to the attention of President Caviello to place our request on tonight's agenda and

371
02:44:29,898 --> 02:44:48,916
We are proposing with the city council's approval to waive the primary and request a homeroom petition. I'm here to state that yes, we all have the right to the democratic process, but in this particular situation, I believe the money spent for a primary can be utilized in a much more productive manner.

372
02:44:48,916 --> 02:45:01,825
There is one additional person on the ballot that requires the city to have a primary. What amplifies the democratic process more than for all candidates to have equal opportunity on the day of the election?

373
02:45:02,332 --> 02:45:19,004
A primary will cost anywhere between $35,000 and $45,000. And I, for one, do not want to add additional expenses onto our taxpayers. For those who believe the money has been allocated for the primary, then why not utilize

374
02:45:19,274 --> 02:45:49,227
in different areas, such as education, public safety, drug prevention programs, or simply towards the maintenance of our streets. I am here to be on record with full disclosure and transparency as a candidate of the Memphis City Council and a resident of this city to respectfully request the Memphis City Council vote on waiving the primary and submitting the request of our home rule petition. I do have the letter. I'm not sure if you are all aware.

375
02:45:49,919 --> 02:46:16,683
I do have a copy of the letter that was signed by all eight candidates, and I'll be more than happy to give it to all of you. I think I think I think they all have it. Do you all have a copy of this? It should go out the packet this week. This should be there. Mr. President, if I may. I guess the question that I have, I guess the question that I have is the president is

376
02:46:17,206 --> 02:46:26,825
this letter that has been signed do all eight candidates still stand in support of it?

377
02:46:27,027 --> 02:46:50,939
I put the motion on with the agreement that all eight candidates supported. One candidate notified me on Saturday that they did not want to continue on it, which prompted me to withdraw the motion. We'll share. We'll share. Would you be willing to disclose, Mr. President, which candidate? I will not.

378
02:46:51,563 --> 02:47:16,167
We know it wasn't Ms. Conyo. It wasn't Ms. Conyo, no. And for the record, if there were eight candidates, I guess I have a question. If there were all eight candidates that had signed that letter, then I think we all had the respect to know who had decided to withdraw because everyone has the right to make their own decision. That decision was not made by me, and I believe I have two other candidates here.

379
02:47:16,167 --> 02:47:37,126
that the decision was not made by them. And for the record, we do have a letter with our signatures on it that still are saying we would like to waive it. And again, if we're going to give everyone the respect that they decided to change their mind, then I ask this committee to give me the same respect of not changing my mind.

380
02:47:39,640 --> 02:47:51,790
And I also have the letter with the three of us who had decided or we never changed our minds. Point of order, Mr. President. Point of order, Councilor Del Rosario.

381
02:47:56,566 --> 02:48:24,292
Mrs. Cuno, the matter has been disposed of. And again, I just want to be on record because it was assumed that I was part and the other two members of the candidates that were running were part of that decision. We were not the part of that decision. It had never been discussed with us. It had only been discussed to waive the primary. So as I know, with all due respect, I understand that you've made your decisions, but I also want it very clear

382
02:48:24,292 --> 02:48:42,652
And on record that I was not for a primary. Thank you. Mr. President. The issue of a primary election has been something that's been heard in rumblings and rumors around the city as to whether or not we should have it, whether or not there are going to be enough candidates to have it, so on and so forth. And the idea of waiving the primary

383
02:48:43,225 --> 02:49:12,520
It can make sense, it makes sense. It certainly makes sense to save money, but then we also have to think philosophically about the way government works. We have to think a little bit more about what dictates why a primary election is supposed to occur. I, for one, came forward and stood with several of my colleagues against a home rule petition to change our charter. I stood with my colleagues and I said, I think that this is something that the voters should address. Right now we have a charter that dictates the way our election should work.

384
02:49:12,942 --> 02:49:21,616
If we're going to change that document, that that document should be done by the initiative petition process and should be done from the ground up based upon the will of the voters.

385
02:49:21,802 --> 02:49:51,788
So I'd have a very difficult time this evening supporting a paper that would waive the requirements of a primary election because the primary election is dictated and outlined in the charter of our community, the document, the blueprint, the constitution of how we're supposed to run our government. So I'd have a very difficult time waiving the primary. I guess it's a moot point at this point because Councilor Caviello has withdrawn the paper and there's no paper that's before the council this evening addressing that issue. However, I can certainly see the benefits of it and the financial

386
02:49:51,788 --> 02:50:07,921
However, the question comes as to what's more important, process or the funds? And I would have a very difficult time if this paper was still on the ground today to vote to waive the primary election, Mr. President.

387
02:50:09,524 --> 02:50:25,893
Name and address of the record, please. Thank you, Mr. President. Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street. I was one of several candidates who reconsidered this letter that we signed on Friday during the day of the lottery, a letter

388
02:50:25,893 --> 02:50:54,260
that was just hastily written. It wasn't notarized. It wasn't written under perjury or penalty going back on it. Considering the costs, I mean, I've been coming to these city council meetings for 10 years and I've been asking for costs to be redirected. And these are monies that are gonna be allocated and spent elsewhere, whether it's on the primary or not. The money essentially is already gone.

389
02:50:54,766 --> 02:51:12,147
Essentially, it's already gone. I wasn't the only candidate who reconsidered. I don't want it to be presented tonight that just one person, because we... I was only notified by one person. Right. I don't know who else. And here we are tonight, notifying you, Mr. President.

390
02:51:12,417 --> 02:51:31,857
on after discussion from some of the candidates. It wasn't hidden from other people who signed. It was presented that way. But with all due respect, the prior speaker was texted on Saturday and informed. I don't know.

391
02:51:31,857 --> 02:51:55,516
Right. I'm just saying it in full disclosure because I don't want it to be portrayed or perceived that anything was covertly done. In considering not having a primary, I mean, the weight of denying citizens an election is something, you know,

392
02:51:55,516 --> 02:52:07,750
Something that weighed heavy on my mind. So I thought about it and I reconsidered speaking for myself. I am not obligated to to have to disclose reasons

393
02:52:08,392 --> 02:52:38,260
why I reconsidered are two people. I am 47 years old. I'm an adult. I can make my own decisions. I reconsidered based on discussion with a sitting council member, as a matter of fact, and I won't mention any names. So I'll just say that it made better sense and it was better judgment and it was better part of the democratic process to have an election and let the voters decide and

394
02:52:38,260 --> 02:53:07,252
Full disclosure, I'm just up here tonight letting you know that everything was above board. It was a simple thing. I greatly respect you for bringing that home rule petition. And I think I explained to everybody on Friday what signing that meant. Right. And I understand that, but things happen and people change their mind. People change their mind all the time. It's non-binding.

395
02:53:07,792 --> 02:53:29,290
Thank you. Your mind changed as well at times. I don't think we should deny an election to the citizens of Medford in a primary. And there will be no denying of anybody. Thank you, Mr. President. Name and address of the record, please. Ray Scalf on 9th, Sunset Ave.

396
02:53:29,881 --> 02:53:54,822
I just want to bring the timeline in to everybody that was notified back and forth. So I was the person that brought forward to all the other seven candidates about not having a primary. With the direction of the Council President Rick Caviello, I contacted all of the seven candidates on the matter, on the cost to eliminate one candidate for a primary election.

397
02:53:55,362 --> 02:54:24,252
Because of that thought process, all candidates agreed to sign a statement on Friday, August 11, to not have a primary. On Saturday, August 12, President Caviello called me and said he spoke to one of the new candidates who reconsidered his position wanting to have a primary. Because of that conversation, President Caviello told me he was withdrawing the home rule petition to cancel the city council primary.

398
02:54:25,400 --> 02:54:54,104
I then proceeded to text all the new candidates about President Caviello's to withdraw the motion of the Home Rule petition. On Monday morning, President Caviello informed me at the coffee shop he was not going to withdraw the motion of the Home Rule petition. I then proceeded to inform again all seven candidates that Council President changed his mind and not to withdraw the Home Rule petition.

399
02:54:54,796 --> 02:55:24,091
Getting confusing? I asked all candidates if they would be willing to sign a document saying they wish to have a primary and to respond to me as soon as possible. I myself, having given considerable thought and receiving feedback from other candidates, along with some citizens, feel that the citizens have the right to have an election and to follow the process.

400
02:55:25,643 --> 02:55:49,859
And as Councilor Knight said, as I remember two years ago, there was an issue on a charter review and certain Councilor, Councilor Knight, made a statement that the citizens that wanted a charter review should follow the process and not send it to the state legislatures. Again, who am I to stop that process on challenging a primary?

401
02:55:51,243 --> 02:56:15,374
There were men and women who have served and died to give us that right to a fair election. I had a cousin who died at the Battle of the Bulge, and an uncle who received the Bronze Star and Purple Heart in World War II, and me, who served seven years in the military. After listening to fellow veterans along with concerned citizens, I don't want to see that right given away and demean their memory.

402
02:56:15,897 --> 02:56:40,771
We also discussed the cost of our last primary two years ago for city council to eliminate one candidate. That process of election went forward. This year's cost, would it really be a savings? It would be just to move the money to the general fund or the free cash account spent elsewhere. It wasn't gonna be earmarked for anywhere. They could spend it anywhere they wanted to.

403
02:56:42,475 --> 02:57:07,720
Personally, I would not like to see the primary canceled. I believe in the right to have a fair election. That was given to us by the men and women that fought for us. And I do have four names signed on a notary. It's a move point anyway. I know it's a move point, but we do have four names that did

404
02:57:08,345 --> 02:57:24,781
We don't need them. All right. The matter has been disposed of. I just wanted to make the record straight. Thank you. Mr. President? Yes. Vice President Mox.

405
02:57:24,781 --> 02:57:53,249
Just if I could, Mr. President, because there's been a lot of discussion around this issue. And I can tell you firsthand that, in my opinion, when we talk about conflicts of interest, about having a vested interest in something, and how we as a legislative body should remove ourselves, I have a real problem with elected officials canceling elections. I have a real problem with that. I think that's probably one of the most unethical things that

406
02:57:56,168 --> 02:58:17,718
uh, honest with you, and to also do it in the name of savings, to me, is just a smokescreen. Because first of all, there is no savings. And secondly, Mr. President, when you look at the budget, and if you want to make a savings, the tax pays and the rate pays in this community have been paying for peg access, which they haven't had for four years.

407
02:58:17,903 --> 02:58:40,280
It's not the way you save in a $160 million budget.

408
02:58:42,035 --> 02:59:09,659
and even non incumbents and incumbents have a vested interest in the process, we should be involved whether or not an election is canceled. And our city charter dictates what should happen. Double the office plus one, you have a primary. Now we're trying to circumvent the process. No matter how you cut it up, we're trying to circumvent the process of allowing residents of this community to get out and vote. Now I realize a primary election

409
02:59:09,878 --> 02:59:36,170
from previous elections, probably 10 to 12 percent turnout. And I know that's probably around 4,000 voters. And that is a lower turnout. But how do you say to 4,000 voters, sorry, we don't believe that this primary is important enough? We don't believe your right to get out and vote is important enough. I don't understand that, Mr. President. I really can't fathom that. And, you know, EFDE here, why are the city turnouts so low?

410
02:59:36,676 --> 02:59:50,412
You know why? Because of these things, these type of things, Mr. President, when we have low turnout and we want to gather interest in the community, and the quickest way to put a fizzle on that is to do away with elections. Think about it.

411
02:59:51,172 --> 03:00:10,139
We're trying to build up elections in this community. This council has asked to promote elections by putting banners out and A-frame signs and other social media to get elections out. And here we are saying, that's canceled the election. It just doesn't make any sense to me, Mr. President. It's not a savings. That's a red herring.

412
03:00:10,139 --> 03:00:29,663
This is all about, Mr. President, about affording the right to people in this community to get out and vote. And even if it's just one person that wants to get out, Mr. President, I'm going to support their right to get out and vote. There is no motion on the floor, Mr. Vice President. I know there's not, but there's been a lot of discussion around this, and I want to let people know where I stand on this, Mr. President.

413
03:00:29,765 --> 03:00:43,028
Thank you. Name and address of the record, please. Ann Marie Cuno, 871 Felsway. I came here a little while ago and I stated what I stated. I am not saying that we shouldn't have an election and I am not saying that we do not.

414
03:00:43,687 --> 03:01:01,895
everyone has the right and deserves the right for an election. What I had said was, is that when we were together on Friday, that was the discussion that we had had. And I know that other people have come up here and said that they've spoken to other people and they've spoken to all of us, and that's fine.

415
03:01:01,895 --> 03:01:16,998
I, on the record, have not received a text message. I have my phone with me. I didn't receive a text message. The only reason I was coming up was just to make it very clear that the discussion that happened between Friday

416
03:01:16,998 --> 03:01:39,070
And I guess Sunday, when you were all at the coffee shop, is that I was not part of it, and I believe that there were two other members that really weren't part of it. But that is for them to say. I'm not trying to eliminate the due process. I'm not trying to take anyone's rights away. I'm just trying to be, it's funny, people say we have to be transparent.

417
03:01:39,762 --> 03:01:49,668
I'm just saying I was not informed of it. So I did not want other people to make a decision for me. That was it.

418
03:01:50,208 --> 03:02:10,930
There was nothing to be informed of. But I don't know. Everybody else is saying that they've texted and spoken to everybody. I'm just going through the question. Move the question, please. Point of order, Mr. President. Point of order, Mr. President. There's nothing to be informed of because there was nothing official. So again, that was an agreement amongst the eight candidates. So it had nothing to do with the City of Medford.

419
03:02:11,268 --> 03:02:38,622
You're absolutely right. But there are other people up here that said the president went to Parliament procedure. Absolutely. I'd like to make a call for the orders of the day, Mr. President. The paper that's the discussion that's being held before us is attached to a paper that's been disposed of already. The paper has been disposed of. Continue this discussion. We can do it during the public decision in the meeting. But we do have some agenda. Yes, we have to move the river back to one more person. Oh, sorry. I didn't speak at all. Someone twice.

420
03:02:39,061 --> 03:03:07,816
They were allowed to do that. Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. Apparently the game is afoot, but I hope that this is the last thing that we're gonna have. The motion has been disposed of, so there is no other discussion on it. No, not on this side of the table. Let her finish, let her just, please. It'll be faster, yeah. But I just wanna say that when I was approached about not holding a primary and then about holding a primary, I insisted that all candidates be notified.

421
03:03:07,816 --> 03:03:31,964
I wasn't notified about a paper that was signed for people coming here tonight that didn't want to have a primary. So I just caution everyone that all the candidates, we should be working together because theoretically, we all want what's best for the city. So I hope that there isn't any backroom deals. When I was approached by candidates, I did speak to them about what's best. So for the record, do you want to waive the primary?

422
03:03:33,382 --> 03:04:02,643
I didn't have strong feelings about it either way. Oh, because I'm looking at the letter and your name's on it and I just wanted to figure if that was okay. That was all, Mr. President. So I thought that everybody put forth solid arguments about it and we're going to have an agreement amongst your eight candidates. Exactly. Thank you. Mr. President, a motion to revert back to the regular business. All those in favor.

423
03:04:03,605 --> 03:04:26,116
Name and address of the record, please. Andrew Paul Castanete, 23 Cushion Street, Method, Massachusetts. My phone number is 781396-TIPS, T-I-P-S.

424
03:04:27,635 --> 03:04:50,787
If I may try to put this in proper perspective for if there's ever a viewing public of this meeting in the future. I believe the formula is, because it is confusing. This meeting is being taped live, is live. It's live. It's on television right now. Okay, thank you. Excuse my appearance. I had a bad injury at the bike path that doesn't exist in the Mystic River.

425
03:04:51,817 --> 03:05:17,332
The formula for a primary, I believe, is seven positions for the city council, which you all hold, times two is 14, add one is 15. If there's 15 or more candidates running, and there are, I believe, triggers a primary according to the city ordinance or charter. Is that accurate? That is correct. Thank you, sir.

426
03:05:20,791 --> 03:05:45,850
I on on when when Mr. City Clerk Finn had the drawing for the post positions. I did sign as a council candidate for this election, a so called document. I believe all eight of us signed it of the challenges I should say.

427
03:05:47,656 --> 03:06:11,686
And that's the only document I ever signed to that nature. And the document was stating, I believe, to let's waive the primary and save the taxpayers $30,000, $45,000. I hear sometimes $70,000. I don't know what the actual figure is. So I said, sure, it makes sense to me, common sense.

428
03:06:12,412 --> 03:06:39,817
that why spend $30,000 to $45,000 to eliminate one out of the 15? And God forbid someone gets eliminated, if there is a primary, that person's not going to feel very happy, I presume. It seems like a lot of big chunk of cash to eliminate one person. However, if you put it in perspective, as Councilor Marks was alluding to,

429
03:06:41,470 --> 03:07:06,226
45,000, when this city spent, first of all, they collected from our pockets, the taxpayers, a billion dollars, over a billion dollars, not including the bonds they borrowed and extended our debt, the public debt. And from real perspective, I believe the 45,000,

430
03:07:07,458 --> 03:07:31,370
is two hundredths of 1% of this year's $167 million budget. Furthermore, bottom line, this might be the best $45,000 this city has ever spent in 55 years. It's going to open up some conversation, I would think. Thank you. You're welcome. I'm not finished.

431
03:07:33,867 --> 03:07:59,602
And maybe we can get some leadership that can improve our situation in the city and lower our real estate taxes, et cetera, et cetera, and improve the quality of life. So frankly, Charlotte, have the primary, don't have the primary, it might be a good thing to spend that $45,000 after all. Thank you. You're quite welcome, sir.

432
03:08:00,614 --> 03:08:27,327
Motion to revert back to regular business. Yes. 17-599 offered by Councilor Lungo-Kern be it resolved that the Energy and Environment Office provide the City of Memphis City Council with an update on test boardings behind the Andrews School and Clippership Park. Councilor Lungo-Kern. Thank you, President Carviello. Just wanted to reach out and hopefully get a written response from Energy and Environment, Ms. Hunt. I know she was working hard on this project and it was

433
03:08:28,137 --> 03:08:54,597
Unfortunate what was discovered on Clippership Park. We also as a council asked that there be test pourings done on at the Andrews School. So I want to make sure that's one of my two reasons. Obviously we want an update, but I want to make sure that those test pourings were done behind the Andrews School where hundreds of children play during school hours and play soccer on the weekends. And I just want to make sure that that soil is not contaminated.

434
03:08:55,323 --> 03:08:58,259
So I move approval on this and ask for a written response.

435
03:08:58,360 --> 03:09:27,858
Councilor Knight. Mr. President, I think this is a good resolution and I second the recommendation. Ultimately, we just this morning, I should say this morning, it feels like this morning, but a little earlier in the evening, we had a presentation by the Massachusetts Area Planning Council and our Office of Community Development concerning the master plan for Medford Square. And that plan focused a lot on the Clippership Connector. So I think it's very important moving forward, since we have this draft plan for the Medford Square that they're looking at, that we understand what's going on over there environmentally.

436
03:09:27,858 --> 03:09:50,656
on the Clippership Connector because that seemed to be a major part of connectivity between the square and other parts of the city. Thank you. On the motion by Councillor Lungo-Kearns, seconded by Councillor Knight. All those in favour? Aye. Motion passes. $17,600 offered by Councillor Knight. Be it resolved that the DPW repair the pothole in front of 12 Golden Avenue. Councillor Knight.

437
03:09:50,656 --> 03:10:14,011
Thank you, Steve Tanaglia, Brian Cairns, and the members of the Met for DPW. I placed a phone call and put this matter on the resolution on the council agenda, but because we're meeting sporadically over the summer, the issue was taken care of in 24 hours. So with that being said, Mr. President, I withdraw the resolution and I thank the DPW for their prompt and quick response. Motion by Councilor Knight to withdraw 17-600.

438
03:10:15,597 --> 03:10:41,500
17-601 offered by Councilor Langel-Kern be it resolved that the final fiscal year 18 budget be posted online in detail and that any candidate for office be allowed to review and receive such a copy of such. Councilor Langel-Kern. Thank you President Carviello. I learned about a week ago that there was a candidate for office who couldn't get the budget book for fiscal year 2018.

439
03:10:41,804 --> 03:11:07,420
which was passed and approved the end of June. And I was surprised. So I just want to make sure that any candidate, anybody, any person who lives in the city who wants to review the budget can do so online or go to the city clerk's office and read a hard copy. And any candidate should be able to, or the mayor's office, wherever that may be, to be able to review the budget in detail. I think it's essential to,

440
03:11:09,209 --> 03:11:30,252
transparency obviously but it's just essential to know what is in that budget where the money spent it's like we just spoke about 160 plus million dollar budget and I really feel that every every candidate and resident in the city should have access to it. Thank you.

441
03:11:30,708 --> 03:11:49,692
I'm under the impression that it is posted and that especially the devotees of the budget process, the citizen participants who are often there year after year to participate in the budget, receive one.

442
03:11:49,945 --> 03:12:18,430
There is a hard copy available now, if I'm not mistaken. Yeah, we got a hard copy this week. I don't know when it was made available. Councilor Knight. I do believe, Mr. President, the public records law would dictate the provision of public documents to individuals in the community. That's the state law. I find it nonsensical for the council to think that they can move forward and put more stringent requirements on something that's already been established by a higher governmental jurisdiction. If I may, through the chair,

443
03:12:18,616 --> 03:12:30,614
I believe the detailed budget that we were given in June with specific information, very detailed information, not all of that is online. I feel like that should be open to the public.

444
03:12:32,318 --> 03:12:58,103
Name and address of the record, please. David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road. I do want to speak on this point because I was the one who was actually trying to get my hands on a budget. I did go in two consecutive weeks in a row to try and get my hands on a budget towards the end of July and was met with a little confusion as to why it wasn't available throughout the actual city hall itself.

445
03:12:58,103 --> 03:13:15,248
I know that the City Clerk tried really hard to figure out how I could get my hands on one. The City Assessor did put a little effort into it and was reverted back to the Mayor's Office to find a copy not available. I did ask if I could get it online. It was met with

446
03:13:15,248 --> 03:13:39,464
the young lady that actually tried to help me with I don't know anything about that. All I know is that the budget is out to print. Now, in my impression, you want to talk about transparency. If you have passed a budget and that budget is enacted the first week of July, every single citizen, not just candidates, every single citizen should be able to get it at any point immediately because if you're working with a budget and that budget is operating,

447
03:13:39,464 --> 03:14:06,127
that means it should be in our hands period. That is not transparency. That is not what this administration is showing in the regards of one of the most simplest documents for that reason. So I strongly suggest that this time next year when a budget is being presented and passed, it is ready to go July 1st because everyone should have it in their hands. Thank you. Thank you. Mr. President.

448
03:14:06,127 --> 03:14:21,753
Thank you, Mr. President. And I mean, I too, I mean, I feel that the budget, I mean, what we do in passing the budget, reviewing the budget is one of our biggest responsibilities. And transparency is key when it comes to the budget. I mean, everyone should be

449
03:14:21,753 --> 03:14:40,265
have access to the budget. I've always felt that way. I think especially when you think about it, there's so much money and everything that runs, runs through the budget. And, you know, we should be encouraging people to get involved with the budget process and actually taking a look at the budget. And, you know, one of the biggest

450
03:14:40,265 --> 03:15:06,100
to me a big initiative that we passed this year, and everyone's still behind, was the legislative software. It was a motion that I brought forward in the spring, and this council stood before it, and it's in the budget, and that is actually to make sure that the materials that we receive with legislative software, all those materials should be in that software package, so everything we get, you'll be able to see in the general public.

451
03:15:06,370 --> 03:15:24,983
It's all public information, but it's going to be easily accessible with legislative software. We have that. That's passed. That's in the budget. It hasn't gone live yet, but to me, in my opinion, I mean, the draft budget, at least, should be part. It should be actually online for people to look at.

452
03:15:24,983 --> 03:15:52,996
So if they come to the meeting, they can be, you know, they can look at it in advance and say, okay, this is how much we're spending here. They can ask good questions. They can be prepared at meetings. And it also, you know, it helps us prepare ourselves too when all this stuff is at our fingertips. So, you know, I do, I've always been a big fan of making sure that, you know, the budget, it's transparent, people can see it and people can access it. So I just wanted to go and just get my thoughts on this process. So thank you.

453
03:15:53,975 --> 03:16:22,848
approval. On the motion by Councilor Longo-Curran, seconded by Councilor Falco. All those in favor? Aye. Motion passes. 17-602 offered by Councilor Longo-Curran be it resolved that a state delegation be contacted to reach out to MassDOT in regards to the way they are handling the Craddock Bridge cleanup and the lack of handicap accessibility. Councilor Longo-Curran. Thank you, President Carviello. We haven't met in a few weeks, so last week I was

454
03:16:23,202 --> 03:16:51,080
I received a number of complaints with regards to the cleanup and the splash of almost cement on the business owner's facade and a number of issues with regards to potential handicap accessibility issues down in that area. And it's very concerning. I did reach out to the mayor's office. I know a number of us have been making calls and trying to get in touch with MassDOT.

455
03:16:51,434 --> 03:17:05,356
I know people have been calling Representative Donato, but as a council, I would like to take a vote that we ask that this cleanup be done in a better way. At the end of the night, a restaurant or

456
03:17:06,014 --> 03:17:30,972
whatever businesses are down there, they should be able to operate with a clean, friendly environment where a wheelchair can pass through or a mother with a stroller to get into a restaurant. And from the pitches I've saw, I'm extremely concerned. I know that, unfortunately, really nobody from the administration has been down there often. Thankfully, our new

457
03:17:30,972 --> 03:17:47,206
commission for persons with disabilities, our new diversity director did go down this week. I'm not sure he found anything not in compliance, but there was a few days last week where I saw the ruler to the door and it just

458
03:17:47,645 --> 03:18:14,307
It's very concerning, so I would ask that we, as a body, take a roll call vote to ask our state delegation to get involved. If I can interject, I have spoken with Representative Leader Donato, and he is in the process of arranging a meeting with the state delegation. Great, great. If you want to send them an official letter, but he was notified, and he is in the process of doing that. If we could just vote to support his endeavors in trying to help that location.

459
03:18:14,493 --> 03:18:38,692
On the motion by Councilor Longo-Kearns, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. Councilor Knight. Mr. President, I, too, got the same phone calls that the Councilor refers to. And I've had conversations with the project manager, Mike Winnick, as well as Dan Fields, the DOT contact and liaison. And it's been brought to my attention that probably the start of September, all the work's going to transfer to the other side of the bridge.

460
03:18:38,692 --> 03:19:08,341
Oh, thank goodness. All the public utilities are going to be able to be moved. That was the side of the bridge that had the most significant amount of public utilities underneath it. That was the side of the bridge that was going to be posing the most trouble and complications during their, what seems like once in a while construction that they do. And come September 1st, it was my understanding that they would be moving to the other side of the street and all the work done in front of Carol's restaurant and the Zamferelli building and so forth would be complete.

461
03:19:08,797 --> 03:19:24,760
So it looks like the sidewalks are pretty much all done. They're all put today on the last couple of days. Mr. President, but if I may, I think that maybe in terms of the direction we're going and calling the state delegation and telling them to do something, why don't we have the state delegation tell us what they're doing and see if that's something we want to support.

462
03:19:24,760 --> 03:19:46,023
So maybe it might be nice for us to have a conversation with the representative and the representative share with us what efforts that they're taking to see if that satisfies us as opposed to standing in line. He is in the process of setting up a meeting with the delegation and he said he would have an answer to me probably in the next week or so. So maybe and we'll get a meeting. Why don't we just ask to be invited to the meeting that he's setting up.

463
03:19:46,208 --> 03:20:12,584
We will be at that meeting. Vice President Mox. Thank you, Mr. President. The meeting was a meeting that this council voted on and requested. And it was my resolution to ask that the state delegation be present. Yes. And also that the primary conversation be surrounded by not really what's taking place over there, but mitigation. I informed the representative about that. Right.

464
03:20:12,584 --> 03:20:29,459
and the impact it's had financially on these businesses. I realize the area is in disarray and some of those businesses have been going through this for two years now, but what is the state going to do regarding the business loss

465
03:20:29,459 --> 03:20:44,461
You can't bring, when it's lost business, you can't bring it back. And in my opinion, Mr. President, the state needs to step forward and we as a city need to step forward on behalf of our businesses that have been impacted by this. That's a state bridge.

466
03:20:44,461 --> 03:21:05,167
It's in the city of Method, but it's a state bridge. We hear all too often, oh, we can't do this on a state road, or we can't do anything regarding tree trimming or sidewalk repair or street repair on state roads. Now we have a state bridge, Mr. President, and we have no say in what's going on in a bridge in the heart of our city.

467
03:21:05,167 --> 03:21:32,656
uh, which makes absolutely no sense to me at all. But, uh, that, uh, meeting that we have is to discuss mitigation. That is correct. That is what I told him. To discuss how we're gonna make these businesses that have been impacted financially for the last two years whole again, Mr. President. You are, you are 100% correct. And that, and that is what, when I, uh, when I, uh, had an official meeting with him, I did tell him that the, that your motion was for, for mitigation. And he understood that.

468
03:21:34,765 --> 03:22:01,732
On the motion by Councilor Longo-Kearns, seconded by Councilor Mox. All those in favor? Aye. Aye. Aye. 17-603. Motion passes. 17-603, offered by Councilor Nye, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council congratulate Amanda and Patrick Collins on the birth of their first child, Ella McKenna Collins.

469
03:22:02,221 --> 03:22:28,664
Mr. President, thank you very much. And a lot can happen in 18 months. As the corner office transitions to a new administration, we saw former Mayor McGlynn reach his 50th wedding anniversary. And we also have seen his daughter bring another grandchild into the world for him. So I'd like to take a moment to congratulate Amanda and Patrick on the birth of their first child. They've just purchased their first home as well.

470
03:22:28,664 --> 03:22:46,417
and I think it's a great momentous occasion to see a family that's five generations in Medford continuing to stay in the family and hopefully have a sixth. So with that being said, I just hope my council colleagues would join me in congratulating Amanda McGlynn Collins and Patrick Collins on the birth of their first child, Ella McKenna Collins. On the motion by Councilor Knight.

471
03:22:46,417 --> 03:23:08,641
seconded by Councilor DelaRusso. All those in favor? Aye. Motion passes. 17-604 be it resolved that the Memphis City Council send its extended Stephenson's Day congratulations to Patricia and David Downey on the momentous occasion of their 50th wedding anniversary. Councilor Knight. Mr. President, thank you very much. If anybody remembers

472
03:23:08,641 --> 03:23:28,250
their time at the Brooks Harb School or at Medford High School. They'll remember Mrs. Downey standing in the front door saying, how can I help you, lovey? And she did that for a good 35 years. And her son David is my closest friend. I met him the first day of school in kindergarten at the Brooks School. And we keep in touch today, even though he's moved overseas across the country about 20 years ago.

473
03:23:28,250 --> 03:23:51,402
But with that being said, it's with great happiness and great pride that I stand here today and I congratulate my friends Pat and David Downey on the momentous occasion of their 50th wedding anniversary, especially on this night, because this is a very night, this night's very special to me. So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in wishing Mr. and Mrs. Downey a very happy 50th wedding anniversary and wishing them another 50 more.

03:23:51,757 --> 03:24:11,990
On the motion by Councilor Night, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelley. All those in favor? Aye. Motion passes. Petitions, presentations, similar matters. 17-607, petition by Andrew P. Cassane, 23 Cushman Street, Medford, to address the Council on new growth and real estate taxes. Mr. Castagnetti.

475
03:24:25,237 --> 03:24:51,460
Thank you, Councilor, President. Part of my appearance, I had a bicycle injury on Mystic River last Wednesday, right where the Clippership connected path is supposed to be. Unfortunately, it's not there. There's a couple of sinkholes. Not quite a path yet. It's boring. Yeah, I noticed. I've been through a thousand times. I get distracted, and it costs me dearly. I've had injuries and broken bones.

476
03:24:53,468 --> 03:25:22,105
If I had some power in this, I would be the first on the agenda that I would take care of. It's public safety, not just that. Mystic Avenue, cars that should not be parked there when five lanes becomes two lanes. I'm talking about new roads, Mystic Avenue. Yes, we are. In a nutshell, Andrew Castanetti, 23 Cushion Street, 781396.

477
03:25:22,493 --> 03:25:47,317
TIPS, T-I-P-S. This new growth, we've had this for many, many years, probably every year since pre-my birth. However, I don't understand why we don't use this new growth, which basically is real estate tax that never existed before from a development.

478
03:25:48,565 --> 03:26:16,628
Why don't they use that new growth to offset Prop 2.5 increases? Directly, it should be directly applied to Prop 2.5 increases. I don't understand why. Two years ago, I did the math, my real estate tax bill went up $400. If they apply the $1.5 million of new growth, brand new real estate taxes,

479
03:26:16,713 --> 03:26:45,502
against the 2.5%, which was $2.5 million, it would have went up $80 instead of $400. And this has been going on since before I was born. Basically, I believe this new growth, it should not be encouraged the way it is. I'm for smart growth, great economic growth.

480
03:26:46,480 --> 03:27:15,050
If you don't use that new real estate tax to offset two and a half increases, not only does it hurt us, it hurts us fivefold. First of all, you need more fire, police, school teachers, buildings, vehicles, and infrastructure improvements. It doesn't make sense to me. I'm asking,

481
03:27:16,417 --> 03:27:44,767
If you could formally ask the mayor for an answer, a formal answer, because I've tried on my own with the head of the city assessor's office, and I have not received a straight answer, although I was told he would mail me something. That was three months ago. I understand I'm not tech savvy. Snail mail can take time.

482
03:27:45,273 --> 03:28:14,686
But it's been three months. Could you please, can one councilor make a formal request to ask the mayor, why aren't we using new growth to offset prop two and a half increases? Sure. Yes. Please. Yeah. Thank you. Who will make that? All of us. Thank you very much.

483
03:28:14,922 --> 03:28:27,393
Do we have approval? Motion to receive in place of file. We're going to ask the Mayor's formal request of the Mayor.

484
03:28:28,220 --> 03:28:56,452
A motion by Councilor Langlois-Carrion to request. You can take an individual vote if you want. It's an amendment. Amended by Councilor Langlois-Carrion that the mayor give an answer why the new growth money is not applied to the taxes. Is that correct, Mr. Kesey? Yes, sir. To the two and a half taxes. To directly offset any proposed part two and a half increase. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you for listening.

485
03:28:56,857 --> 03:29:05,463
On the motion by Councilor Langlois-Carrion. All those in favor? Aye. Motion passes. 17-609 Communications from the Mayor.

486
03:29:06,745 --> 03:29:35,247
Mr. President, City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that Your Honorable Body consider the attached resolution in support of House Bill 2683 and Senate Bill 1845. Unrepaired gas leaks not only emit dangerous gases into the air we breathe, but the cost of this gas, this lost gas, is passed on to the consumer. Please support this measure on behalf of the citizens of Medford.

487
03:29:35,737 --> 03:30:00,880
I think we discussed this in substance, apparently. We did? It's a little different. It's a little different than what, this is actually, as the gas and electric company do, not charge us for the energy use. Mr. President? I'd like to amend the paper to be added as a co-sponsor.

488
03:30:01,437 --> 03:30:18,852
And if you could add, Mr. Clay can you be the one that has to read it? I'm sorry? Can you make me be the one that has to read it? Do you want me to read it? Do you want to waive the reading? I think we can waive the reading. Waive the reading. Would you please add Councillor Knight as a co-sponsor?

489
03:30:22,497 --> 03:30:47,540
the bill that the mayor has proposed. What are we all adding? The resolution. The resolution that the mayor has proposed. Why don't you add the whole city council? Yeah, add the whole city council. We're all co-sponsors. On the motion to... The whole council supports it. She's asking for the whole council's support. So the whole council hopefully will support it.

490
03:30:48,755 --> 03:31:05,917
Councilor, Vice President Mox. I think this is worthy, although I'll be quite frank with you, I haven't read both bills, but my only question I had was regarding if we're going to require them not to charge the

491
03:31:07,013 --> 03:31:20,227
the homeowner, which I think is a novel concept. And I assume that would require them to then, on their end, start fixing these leaks. Ultimately, who's going to end up paying for this?

492
03:31:21,425 --> 03:31:48,003
Um, and I, I'd like to hear from someone, uh, you know, stating, I don't know, maybe Mr. Tudin can answer that, but, uh, ultimately, I would assume they're going to pass that off to ... The consumer. The consumer. Right. Um ... So we don't pay one way or another. Right. So secondly, Mr. President, and it's good, uh, you know, we have, uh, level three leaks, which, uh, they, they don't even look at level three leaks. They only look at level one and two leaks, uh, in our community.

493
03:31:48,003 --> 03:32:06,650
I would also ask, Mr. President, an issue that I've been talking about for years, that the mayor supports looking at unaccounted for gas and making a savings to the gas payers so they're not paying for that. And I would ask the mayor respectfully, why doesn't she look at unaccounted for water

494
03:32:06,650 --> 03:32:28,283
which every single ratepayer in this community has been paying through the nose for years. It's roughly 20 percent. It's millions of dollars, Mr. President, of unaccounted for water that we're all paying for. So I realize the mayor is hip on this and wants to see the people have a savings. I would hope she'd also like to see

495
03:32:28,283 --> 03:32:57,038
The people have a savings on unaccounted-for water, which has been a real major concern for many, many years in this community. Cost and the rate pay is millions of dollars, Mr. President. So I'd like for that to accompany this paper in asking her what her thoughts are on unaccounted-for water, because there's ways, as a community, we have over $7 million in the water and sewer enterprise account that we can address unaccounted-for water. So there are ways, Mr. President, that we can

496
03:32:58,051 --> 03:33:26,367
look out for the ratepayer in this community regarding water. Thank you. As amended. On the motion that we as amended by Councilor Mox. Motion to sever. Motion by Councilor Knight to sever the paper. We'll vote on the first paper. All those in favor of the Mayor's resolution on the first one.

497
03:33:27,076 --> 03:33:56,017
As co-sponsored by the City Council. As co-sponsored by Councilor Knight. All those in favor, roll call vote. Roll call vote has been requested. Councilor Dela Rousseau. Yes. Councilor Falco. Yes. Councilor Knight. Yes. Councilor Malauulu-Curran. Yes. Vice President Mox. Yes. Councilor Scott Hilliard. Yes. President Cavioli. Yes. Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative. Motion passes. On the second paper by Councilor Mox,

498
03:33:56,017 --> 03:34:20,165
that the mayor look into, the administration look into the unaccounted for water, so we can save the water rate payers money as well. Point of information, Mr. President, have we not sent a similar resolution to the mayor's office in the past six months? I cannot recall, Mr. Councilman. Send it again.

499
03:34:20,857 --> 03:34:43,975
We may have, we may not have, but we can send it again. Thank you. The roll call vote has been requested. Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

500
03:34:44,397 --> 03:35:00,682
Councilor Kerr? Yes. Vice President Marks? Yes. Councilor Scarpelli? Yes. Vice President Caviello? Yes. Seven in the affirmative, none in the negative. Motion passes. Unfinished business. Motion to take a paper off the table, Mr. President.

501
03:35:01,188 --> 03:35:30,432
Motion by Councilor De La Rosa to take the paper off the table. $17,581,000. $17,581,000. Your Honor. For $2,075,000. $2,075,000 in water system improvements. This is the third reading this evening. Bless you. Mr. Clerk, would you please call the roll on the third reading of this law.

502
03:35:31,681 --> 03:36:00,740
It is. The paper is before us. Motion for the third reading by Councilor Dela Rousseau. Second. Seconded by Councilor Knight. Councilor Dela Rousseau. Affirmative. Councilor Falcone. Yes. Councilor Knight. Yes. Councilor McIntyre. Yes. Vice President Maher. Yes. Councilor Scott Kelly. Yes. Vice President Caviello. Yes. Seven in the affirmative, nine in the negative.

503
03:36:03,237 --> 03:36:29,410
17612, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Annette Michella on her recent passing. Councilor Knight. Mr. President, thank you very much. It's with deep sadness that I put this resolution forward. Annette was wake last evening and was given her burial today. She's a good friend. Her son John and I grew up together. Her son Tommy and I grew up together.

504
03:36:29,410 --> 03:36:55,195
And I'm very sad to see her go. She struggled for a very long time with multiple sclerosis and was also bravely battling cancer towards the end. And the illness got the better of her body, but didn't get the betterment of her heart and soul, Mr. President, through the whole time that she was ill. She was a constant fighter, and it's just a tragic, tragic situation to see it happen. I want to just offer my deep, insincere condolences to the family.

505
03:36:55,195 --> 03:37:17,875
You know, for those of us that remember Annette, we'd always see her down in Mario's Classic Barrel working down there for Mario or over at the liquor store or clerking at the liquor store on Mr. Gabb. So, you know, she's a face that's been in the community for a long time. She raised two great kids here in the city of Medford and she's going to be sadly missed, Mr. President. She was also an election official. Yes, she was. I second that. And we get please stand for a moment of silence.

506
03:37:29,468 --> 03:37:59,118
if I could also. Vice President Mox. Annette was a staple in the Wellington area with her and her sons as was mentioned. She was always a friendly face at ward 7 precinct 2 and she was a terrific mother, friend, and she will be sorely missed. Thank you. Mr. President we're on suspension. Paper 17575 off the table please.

507
03:38:05,935 --> 03:38:30,674
one seven what was that community preservation act homework petition one seven five seven five council and i um motion to receive in place on file no but the petition is not here the petitioner is not here come sunday i say that the paper is out of order mr president it's not really a petition because it's not a use of the petition process it's really something that should be referred to public anticipation you are correct thank you more questions

508
03:38:32,750 --> 03:38:42,824
What is the question? Would you like to move? Receive and place a fat. Receive and place a fat. On the motion by Councillor Naita, receive. Yes. If I could, Mr. President.

509
03:38:43,145 --> 03:39:03,563
The petitioner was here at our last meeting in July. The hour grew late. He asked that it respectfully be laid on the table. The petitioner had a death in his family, Mr. President, and he would respectfully ask that it continue to be laid on the table, Mr. President, so he can come up and speak on it.

510
03:39:04,441 --> 03:39:24,522
Thank you. And like I said, Mr. President, it's more of a procedural issue than anything else. I feel as though it's something that should be done in the public participation process of the meeting. That's not something that can be filed at the beginning of the next meeting and be put on the next meeting. It doesn't have to be something that sits on the table for the entire period. Again, like I said, it did go to the last meeting at a very late hour.

511
03:39:24,522 --> 03:39:53,210
And they did ask that we... I just have a little bit of a concern, Mr. President, about the way that the petition process is being used and not necessarily maybe in the right way or in the right frame. I think the petition process is starting to become overly politicized. And a lot of these items that are being brought up through petitions should really be done during public participation. Where it is already on the agenda, I feel that we should just keep it there. I withdraw my motion, Mr. President. We currently don't have the support.

512
03:39:53,210 --> 03:39:59,740
Okay, we have one last one offered by Councilor Scarpelli. Be it resolved that the City Council.

513
03:40:00,213 --> 03:40:29,069
congratulate Mr. and Mrs. Adam Knight on celebrating the eighth wedding anniversary. Councilman Scott Pelley. Well, thank you, Mr. President. I know Adam prides himself on wishing everybody every luck in the world, so I know that the person that deserves it more than anyone is his wife, and so we just congratulate them in making eight years. I said nine, but he corrected me.

514
03:40:29,069 --> 03:40:45,488
The rumor has it she might be mine now. You better ask your wife. Thank you. Congratulations. 20 years all together. And thank you. I'll pat my own wife on the back. Next week will be 41 years for me. Wow. Wow. Congrats. Imagine how lucky my wife is. Yeah.

515
03:40:46,315 --> 03:41:11,543
Congratulations. Mr. President, I moved to table the records of last week. The records that were passed by Councilor Knight will be tabled to the next meeting. Motion to adjourn by Councilor Knight. Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. All in favor, aye. Motion passes.

516
03:41:24,284 --> 03:41:49,478
Well, Thomas, you've got prediabetes. But with more exercise and a change in diet, it can be reversed. I've tried exercising. It just makes me hungry. For bacon.

517
03:41:50,491 --> 03:42:16,664
I love bacon, too. And who really likes to exercise? Not me. Me neither. Nobody. So, we're good? What? Oh, you still have pre-diabetes. Big time. Marie, you have pre-diabetes. Pre-diabetes? I don't have time to eat right or exercise. I'm a busy mom.

518
03:42:17,170 --> 03:42:30,822
Oh, you're a busy mom. Yeah. This is great news. Busy moms never get pre-diabetes. Wait, what? Let me just... Yeah, this is all the people at risk for pre-diabetes, and way over here, busy moms.
