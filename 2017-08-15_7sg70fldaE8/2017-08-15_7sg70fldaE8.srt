126
00:32:01,678 --> 00:32:13,242
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you're going to extend until September meeting, but I think we did get an email with regards to the towers that are behind the property and the loading times.

127
00:32:13,383 --> 00:32:23,467
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe before then you can do some research and see what times the trucks are going to be delivering and unloading, just so even if we do want to extend your permit, we can

128
00:32:24,147 --> 00:32:31,132
[SPEAKER_05]: assure the residents that live in those buildings that even though the hours of operations may be 6 a.m.

129
00:32:31,392 --> 00:32:33,014
[SPEAKER_05]: in the morning or 11 p.m.

130
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:42,761
[SPEAKER_05]: at night, I think it was 12, 12 in the morning, that we know that the deliveries will not be at that time so they will still have peace and enjoyment of their properties.

131
00:32:43,548 --> 00:32:52,392
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you, Councilor, and that's something we'd like to address, and that's one of the reasons we're extending through until September, so we can hear, better understand the concerns of our neighbors.

132
00:32:52,412 --> 00:32:56,434
[SPEAKER_35]: We want to be good neighbors and address those concerns at the open public hearing.

133
00:32:56,474 --> 00:33:03,637
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think he said that they are planning a meeting with the Condo Association to address them in person and addressing their needs.

134
00:33:04,177 --> 00:33:05,578
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we have a motion to table this?

[SPEAKER_25]: OK.

152
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:15,800
[SPEAKER_25]: 17-591.

153
00:34:22,868 --> 00:34:27,171
[SPEAKER_26]: Location of poles, attachment of fixtures, and underground conduits, Medford Mass.

154
00:34:27,431 --> 00:34:45,923
[SPEAKER_26]: You are hereby notified that the order of the Medford City Council public hearing will be given at the Community Access Building in Medford Heights, 489 Winthrop Street, Medford Mass, on Tuesday, August 15th, on a petition by Comcast Cable Communications Management, LLC, for permission to construct a line for such telecommunication under the public way of ways here.

155
00:34:45,943 --> 00:34:51,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, motion to waive the reading and have a representative from the petitioner have a brief synopsis of it.

[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks.

157
00:34:54,267 --> 00:34:54,827
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

158
00:34:55,047 --> 00:34:55,227
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

159
00:34:55,327 --> 00:34:55,487
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

160
00:34:56,428 --> 00:34:57,448
[SPEAKER_18]: Name and address for the record, please.

161
00:34:57,468 --> 00:34:57,928
[SPEAKER_18]: Good evening.

162
00:34:57,968 --> 00:35:00,609
[SPEAKER_17]: Dave Llewellyn, Comcast, Woobin, Massachusetts.

163
00:35:01,909 --> 00:35:16,514
[SPEAKER_17]: This petition, Washington Street, will be starting at existing utility pole 5507, excavating in the sidewalk to place one four-inch PVC conduit 37 feet plus or minus to existing telephone manhole located in the sidewalk.

164
00:35:18,285 --> 00:35:18,605
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

165
00:35:19,146 --> 00:35:20,246
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, this is a public hearing.

166
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:22,788
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we have anyone here to speak in favor of this?

167
00:35:23,268 --> 00:35:24,009
[SPEAKER_26]: Would that be yourself?

168
00:35:24,169 --> 00:35:24,349
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

169
00:35:24,809 --> 00:35:26,130
[SPEAKER_26]: Is there anyone else in favor of this?

170
00:35:27,031 --> 00:35:29,873
[SPEAKER_26]: Hearing and seeing none, I motion that part of the meeting closed.

171
00:35:30,373 --> 00:35:32,555
[SPEAKER_26]: Is there anyone that is against this?

172
00:35:33,735 --> 00:35:34,636
[SPEAKER_26]: Anyone not in favor?

173
00:35:35,156 --> 00:35:40,260
[SPEAKER_26]: Hearing and seeing none, I motion that part of the hearing closed.

174
00:35:41,576 --> 00:35:42,256
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President.

175
00:35:43,557 --> 00:35:44,258
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Dello Russo.

176
00:35:44,358 --> 00:35:48,200
[SPEAKER_19]: If I could, through the chair, ask the petitioner, what is the purpose of this?

177
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,202
[SPEAKER_19]: Is there a new, why do you have to do this?

178
00:35:51,623 --> 00:35:52,523
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a new building?

179
00:35:52,823 --> 00:36:03,310
[SPEAKER_17]: We're tying into the existing Verizon manhole that ties into the conduit system that we're already into to provide service to 53 Riverside Ave., which is the Middlesex Bank.

180
00:36:04,271 --> 00:36:04,651
[SPEAKER_17]: Very good.

181
00:36:05,272 --> 00:36:05,752
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. President.

182
00:36:05,772 --> 00:36:06,332
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Belko.

183
00:36:07,493 --> 00:36:08,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

184
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:09,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a couple of quick questions.

185
00:36:11,003 --> 00:36:13,764
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to get a little bit more background on this, how long will this project take?

186
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:15,585
[SPEAKER_17]: A couple of days.

187
00:36:15,605 --> 00:36:17,646
[SPEAKER_17]: A couple of days.

188
00:36:17,687 --> 00:36:19,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know when it's going to begin?

189
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:25,170
[SPEAKER_17]: As soon as this is granted, we'll have the contractor go in and pull the street opening permit.

190
00:36:25,190 --> 00:36:28,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know how many sidewalk panels are impacted?

191
00:36:28,672 --> 00:36:31,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so the residents in the neighborhood have some sort of idea.

192
00:36:31,374 --> 00:36:33,655
[SPEAKER_17]: I think there was maybe 37 feet.

193
00:36:33,695 --> 00:36:35,516
[SPEAKER_17]: I think there was maybe five panels.

194
00:36:36,656 --> 00:36:37,477
[SPEAKER_17]: Give or take a couple.

195
00:36:38,022 --> 00:36:40,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And will there be any impact with regard to traffic in the neighborhood?

196
00:36:42,244 --> 00:36:42,965
[SPEAKER_17]: I would say no.

197
00:36:43,045 --> 00:36:53,250
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I don't know if there's a lot of pedestrian traffic in the sidewalk there, but they can put some traffic control signs there to block the sidewalk and divert them around.

198
00:36:53,350 --> 00:37:01,114
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's basically pretty much almost a day or two's work for the most part once they excavate it all out.

199
00:37:01,134 --> 00:37:05,316
[SPEAKER_17]: And then the biggest part of it will be going back and replacing the concrete.

200
00:37:05,756 --> 00:37:06,797
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what's going to take the time.

201
00:37:08,154 --> 00:37:08,934
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. President?

202
00:37:09,514 --> 00:37:10,115
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, thank you.

203
00:37:10,135 --> 00:37:11,535
[SPEAKER_32]: So it's strictly sidewalk work?

204
00:37:11,715 --> 00:37:11,895
[SPEAKER_32]: No.

205
00:37:12,075 --> 00:37:13,035
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, nothing in the street.

206
00:37:13,255 --> 00:37:15,736
[SPEAKER_15]: And what materials are used to replace the sidewalk panels, the same existing?

207
00:37:15,976 --> 00:37:17,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Same, yes, it's concrete.

208
00:37:17,757 --> 00:37:18,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scott, go ahead.

209
00:37:18,917 --> 00:37:26,419
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that I echo Councilor Knight's, one of the biggest concerns we've had in this council in the last couple of years, two years that we've been on set.

210
00:37:26,959 --> 00:37:55,859
[SPEAKER_14]: that whenever there's a utility company that comes in, the way they found the street and sidewalks in a better condition than, if the same or if not better condition, than it was left, because we have a huge issue with contractors coming in, representing the utilities, and then leaving sub-par work behind, and then the city is left, and the constituents are left holding the bag, so I think that it's very important that that piece

211
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:04,909
[SPEAKER_14]: discussion with the city's engineer making sure that the most approach.

212
00:38:04,929 --> 00:38:17,073
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President also looks here that the petitioner has agreed to remove an asphalt patch that's been put around another existing utility pole as part of mitigation to help fill those gaps with concrete to keep it consistent with the rest of the sidewalk.

213
00:38:17,113 --> 00:38:19,474
[SPEAKER_15]: So I have no problem with this petition.

214
00:38:19,494 --> 00:38:21,015
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, I move for approval.

215
00:38:21,055 --> 00:38:21,215
[SPEAKER_15]: Second.

216
00:38:21,715 --> 00:38:26,098
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion by Councilor Knight to approval, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

217
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,099
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

218
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:27,359
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

219
00:38:27,399 --> 00:38:34,623
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

220
00:38:34,643 --> 00:38:35,404
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

221
00:38:35,424 --> 00:38:36,385
[SPEAKER_26]: 17-592, location of poles.

222
00:38:36,765 --> 00:38:39,106
[SPEAKER_26]: Attachments of fixtures in underground conduits.

223
00:38:39,507 --> 00:38:44,210
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, motion to waive the reading and have a representative from the petitioner give us a brief synopsis of the project.

224
00:38:45,030 --> 00:38:48,833
[SPEAKER_26]: That would be, let me see, Siena Engineering Group.

225
00:38:51,389 --> 00:38:52,410
[SPEAKER_11]: Name and address of the record, please.

226
00:38:53,912 --> 00:38:55,974
[SPEAKER_11]: With Sienna Engineering Group, my name is John Kennedy.

227
00:38:56,314 --> 00:38:58,056
[SPEAKER_11]: We're at 50 Mall Road in Burlington, Mass.

228
00:39:03,922 --> 00:39:04,943
[SPEAKER_26]: Sure.

229
00:39:05,243 --> 00:39:08,987
[SPEAKER_26]: So are you in favor of this?

230
00:39:09,387 --> 00:39:10,088
[SPEAKER_26]: I am in favor.

231
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:13,732
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we have any votes in favor of this project?

232
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:18,057
[SPEAKER_26]: Hearing and seeing none, I close that part of the hearing.

233
00:39:18,398 --> 00:39:21,066
[SPEAKER_26]: Is there anyone here that wishes to speak against this project?

234
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,062
[SPEAKER_26]: Hearing and seeing none, I motion that part of the hearing close.

235
00:39:25,662 --> 00:39:26,022
[SPEAKER_26]: Continue.

236
00:39:26,843 --> 00:39:29,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so this is a conduit build.

237
00:39:30,485 --> 00:39:35,608
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess we're starting on Granville Avenue at the railroad right-of-way.

238
00:39:35,848 --> 00:39:45,014
[SPEAKER_11]: We're replacing a handhold and we're constructing 200 feet of conduit to a manhole location at the location of Winchester Street and Granville Avenue.

239
00:39:45,494 --> 00:39:50,898
[SPEAKER_11]: Then we're constructing another 722 feet to another structure, a manhole structure.

240
00:39:51,977 --> 00:39:57,812
[SPEAKER_11]: And then from that, we'd go out to a Verizon manhole that's actually in the city of Somerville.

241
00:40:01,715 --> 00:40:02,275
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Dello Russo.

242
00:40:02,315 --> 00:40:03,616
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a lot of questions.

243
00:40:04,437 --> 00:40:04,717
[SPEAKER_11]: Why?

244
00:40:06,659 --> 00:40:13,004
[SPEAKER_11]: So on Broadway, there's a bridge that crosses over the railway.

245
00:40:13,404 --> 00:40:13,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

246
00:40:13,944 --> 00:40:23,171
[SPEAKER_11]: And in order for them to replace that bridge for the Green Line Extension Project, we have to relocate our cable, which is running right down the right of way.

247
00:40:24,272 --> 00:40:26,154
[SPEAKER_11]: And the way to do that is to get it up

248
00:40:26,974 --> 00:40:35,607
[SPEAKER_11]: into the Verizon structure and then take it from the Verizon structure down Winchester, down Granville, and get it back onto the railway beyond the bridge where they're doing the construction.

249
00:40:35,991 --> 00:40:39,132
[SPEAKER_19]: Tell us about the type of conduit that you're going to be building.

250
00:40:39,192 --> 00:40:42,514
[SPEAKER_19]: Is it a contained concrete tunnel?

251
00:40:42,634 --> 00:40:51,878
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it a... It's typical construction with two four-inch conduits encased in concrete, 48 inches of depth down.

252
00:40:53,019 --> 00:40:58,101
[SPEAKER_11]: And obviously, we're going to be looking to mitigate intersecting with anything else that might be in the roadway.

253
00:40:58,869 --> 00:41:01,271
[SPEAKER_19]: And are you going to be digging in the road and the sidewalks?

254
00:41:01,972 --> 00:41:02,532
[SPEAKER_19]: All on the road.

255
00:41:02,832 --> 00:41:05,634
[SPEAKER_19]: And what kind of wiring is this?

256
00:41:06,495 --> 00:41:10,638
[SPEAKER_11]: So what would go back, what we're relocating is a fiber optic cable for AT&T.

257
00:41:10,999 --> 00:41:11,259
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

258
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:13,461
[SPEAKER_24]: Councilor Falco.

259
00:41:13,581 --> 00:41:15,662
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, I'm not in the room, Mr. President.

260
00:41:15,722 --> 00:41:16,203
[SPEAKER_19]: I apologize.

261
00:41:16,643 --> 00:41:17,123
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

262
00:41:18,364 --> 00:41:27,452
[SPEAKER_19]: The people on Winchester Street have had the heck beaten out of them for the past five years, and they've been shanghaied every step of the way.

263
00:41:28,949 --> 00:41:42,624
[SPEAKER_19]: The businesses on Boston Avenue with relation to construction tied into the Green Line and some related developments that are going to capitalize off of the Green Line have suffered tremendously.

264
00:41:43,364 --> 00:41:48,009
[SPEAKER_19]: On Winchester Street, on the other end from where you're digging, down towards Harvard

265
00:41:49,631 --> 00:42:06,849
[SPEAKER_19]: Residents were disrupted for two years with work that was done to accommodate the widening of the Harvard Street Bridge and dealing with a lot of the issues there, some of which were promised to be addressed and never were.

266
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:10,372
[SPEAKER_19]: I speak of drainage issues in that area.

267
00:42:10,932 --> 00:42:13,673
[SPEAKER_19]: So beneath the Harvard Street Bridge still floods.

268
00:42:14,354 --> 00:42:14,574
[SPEAKER_19]: St.

269
00:42:14,634 --> 00:42:21,138
[SPEAKER_19]: Clement's School, though it's in a transition, still takes on sewage.

270
00:42:22,279 --> 00:42:24,262
[SPEAKER_19]: an elementary school takes on sewage.

271
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,426
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, I'm not saying that you are the cause of this.

272
00:42:27,927 --> 00:42:38,420
[SPEAKER_19]: What I'm saying is that the people who I represent are going to now be faced with another in a series of disruptive construction projects that's going to

273
00:42:39,321 --> 00:43:01,562
[SPEAKER_19]: challenge their egress in and off of their properties, is going to tie up traffic in a cut-through street that gets people between Harvard Street and Broadway and avoids using the ridiculous powerhouse circle, which has traffic patterns and timing there that is contrary to reason.

274
00:43:04,872 --> 00:43:13,298
[SPEAKER_19]: What are you folks going to do for the people of Medford on these streets who've had to put up with this over the several years?

275
00:43:13,358 --> 00:43:18,041
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm not trying to put you on the spot or make you feel uncomfortable, but the fact of the matter is these people are hurting.

276
00:43:19,462 --> 00:43:25,126
[SPEAKER_19]: And they need to be assured and in very concrete ways on

277
00:43:27,702 --> 00:43:28,803
[SPEAKER_19]: How are they going to be treated?

278
00:43:28,883 --> 00:43:31,105
[SPEAKER_19]: How are they going to be communicated with?

279
00:43:31,906 --> 00:43:36,730
[SPEAKER_19]: Is just a silly flyer going to be stuck under their doors?

280
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:40,173
[SPEAKER_19]: Are they going to have a normal person who's going to talk to them and listen to them?

281
00:43:40,193 --> 00:43:46,098
[SPEAKER_19]: Or are they just going to be besieged with emails that get put into their spam box?

282
00:43:46,823 --> 00:43:50,525
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I will definitely have a representative on site while we're doing this dig.

283
00:43:50,865 --> 00:43:56,807
[SPEAKER_11]: To speak to those other items, this is not a project that's not even on that kind of scale.

284
00:43:56,867 --> 00:44:01,349
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a simple two, four-inch conduit duct rework.

285
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:09,433
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's a typical trench that you might see in the roadway happening for gas, for instance, or anybody else.

286
00:44:10,933 --> 00:44:13,897
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not going to be impacting in that that way.

287
00:44:14,037 --> 00:44:29,954
[SPEAKER_11]: We definitely will impact traffic We have traffic plans that we submit to your engineering department and we will look to make it work with both the police department and Setting up traffic plans appropriately and obviously we'll listen to your constituency in the area while we're working

288
00:44:30,494 --> 00:44:39,618
[SPEAKER_19]: So will there be someone on site who's going to be available and consistent to just help these people who really feel beat up at this point?

289
00:44:40,018 --> 00:44:40,478
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.

290
00:44:41,239 --> 00:44:44,480
[SPEAKER_11]: Siena will definitely have somebody on site while the contractor is working.

291
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:45,801
[SPEAKER_11]: And who is Siena?

292
00:44:46,061 --> 00:44:49,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Siena is an engineering firm and we're representing AT&T.

293
00:44:49,582 --> 00:44:53,464
[SPEAKER_11]: So basically we will work with a contractor that will be on site.

294
00:44:53,724 --> 00:44:55,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, good, good.

295
00:44:56,525 --> 00:44:57,265
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you Mr. President.

296
00:44:57,405 --> 00:44:58,005
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Falco.

297
00:44:58,125 --> 00:45:10,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you Mr. President and some of the similar similar questions I guess but you know as far as that the length of time this project is going to take and when do you think this will begin just so if anyone here that was watching at home tonight.

298
00:45:11,028 --> 00:45:16,870
[SPEAKER_11]: So what we're trying to do is get this done before December is our goal.

299
00:45:16,910 --> 00:45:18,630
[SPEAKER_11]: Before the moratorium we'd like to get it done.

300
00:45:18,910 --> 00:45:25,652
[SPEAKER_11]: We're still working out this grant allocation as well in Somerville and as soon as we get that we're going to get underway so

301
00:45:26,372 --> 00:45:28,413
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in the process of putting all the pieces together.

302
00:45:28,453 --> 00:45:30,234
[SPEAKER_11]: We'd like to get started as soon as possible.

303
00:45:30,815 --> 00:45:38,519
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're looking at, depending on how things go and what the impact is in terms of traffic, it would be four to six weeks, I would think.

304
00:45:38,959 --> 00:45:41,441
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's the outside.

305
00:45:41,501 --> 00:45:43,002
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't say exactly.

306
00:45:43,022 --> 00:45:51,367
[SPEAKER_11]: It depends on how long it takes us to get underway and if we run into issues in terms of traffic or if you have special events or any of those things.

307
00:45:52,027 --> 00:45:53,269
[SPEAKER_11]: that might be impacted.

308
00:45:53,309 --> 00:45:56,612
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if there are road races scheduled for the next couple of weeks.

309
00:45:57,593 --> 00:45:59,155
[SPEAKER_11]: When we could get out there and get it done.

310
00:45:59,555 --> 00:46:03,540
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as the, so would the work hours be just your normal 9 to 5?

311
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:04,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it would be.

312
00:46:05,341 --> 00:46:12,910
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we were going to do anything, or if we were looking to get some relief on that, we would obviously come to the city and ask if we could do that.

313
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:20,372
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as the impact to the neighbors that live in that neighborhood, are we talking about they're not going to have access to their driveways?

314
00:46:21,053 --> 00:46:23,313
[SPEAKER_02]: What will be the impact and how will they be notified?

315
00:46:23,574 --> 00:46:24,914
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it would be minimal.

316
00:46:25,654 --> 00:46:32,176
[SPEAKER_11]: Obviously, where we're working, it may take a day for us to get out of the way of a driveway, for instance, but we'll be looking to keep

317
00:46:33,797 --> 00:46:41,965
[SPEAKER_11]: pedestrian traffic moving at all times, keep roadways open as much as we can, and keep driveways open as much as possible.

318
00:46:42,625 --> 00:46:46,028
[SPEAKER_02]: So will you be, you know, sending a notice to the neighbors?

319
00:46:46,068 --> 00:46:52,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just to let them know the driveway could possibly be not accessible, you know, during these dates?

320
00:46:52,174 --> 00:46:54,256
[SPEAKER_11]: We certainly could do something like that if we needed to.

321
00:46:55,256 --> 00:47:03,520
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would think, you know, just I think it's a good idea just to let them know, you know, that this project is going to happen and, you know, just so they're informed.

322
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:09,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, because I think the worst thing is when there's no communication, that's when the phones start ringing.

323
00:47:09,522 --> 00:47:11,543
[SPEAKER_02]: that, you know what, I knew nothing about this.

324
00:47:11,683 --> 00:47:16,965
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the person that might live in the street might not know nothing about or anything about this project.

325
00:47:17,185 --> 00:47:22,327
[SPEAKER_02]: They might have minimal information, but then all of a sudden they can't get into the driveway, and they're calling us for answers.

326
00:47:22,387 --> 00:47:29,170
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think reaching out to the community, to those streets that are impacted and those neighbors that are impacted, it's definitely something that

327
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:30,671
[SPEAKER_02]: I would recommend.

328
00:47:30,971 --> 00:47:34,174
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and I believe we did send out a listing and mailing already.

329
00:47:34,394 --> 00:47:36,556
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, good.

330
00:47:36,636 --> 00:47:38,858
[SPEAKER_11]: But once we get started, we can do that again.

331
00:47:38,958 --> 00:47:43,982
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know one of the stipulations was that we get together and sit down before we get started.

332
00:47:44,002 --> 00:47:50,127
[SPEAKER_11]: And we will have a schedule at that time where we can tell you what we think it's going to take us to get it done.

333
00:47:50,648 --> 00:47:51,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, thank you.

334
00:47:51,208 --> 00:47:54,451
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as the, do you foresee any road closures at all?

335
00:47:55,792 --> 00:48:03,098
[SPEAKER_11]: the way that we have our traffic plan set up right now there are no road closures so we're not we don't anticipate that there would be actual road closures.

336
00:48:03,138 --> 00:48:09,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay I'm just concerned where if you because I think this this if I'm reading this map correctly this leads out to Broadway right?

337
00:48:09,464 --> 00:48:10,164
[SPEAKER_10]: It does yeah.

338
00:48:10,184 --> 00:48:14,428
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just concerned that if you if you're closing a road in Somerville and

339
00:48:16,172 --> 00:48:18,473
[SPEAKER_02]: The residents in Medford don't know anything about it.

340
00:48:18,713 --> 00:48:35,497
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a disconnect there, so if there are any road closures, you know, I would think that, you know, if we could just make sure that the residents know, just because the worst thing is when something insurmountable is impacting them and they don't know anything about it, you know, that's something that we should keep into, you know, take into account.

341
00:48:35,717 --> 00:48:44,340
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, absolutely, if you look at the traffic plan, I don't think we're, we're not planning on closing any roads and we obviously would like to try to keep traffic moving in all directions.

342
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:54,364
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, setting up the proper traffic plan and also getting some help from both police departments to make sure that we can keep traffic moving, that's the goal.

343
00:48:54,664 --> 00:48:55,684
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, thank you very much.

344
00:48:58,725 --> 00:49:00,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, I think my questions have been asked and answered.

345
00:49:00,966 --> 00:49:02,647
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

346
00:49:02,847 --> 00:49:06,269
[SPEAKER_15]: This is what it looks like, what, 948 feet of trench work that you want to do?

347
00:49:06,469 --> 00:49:08,870
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's about almost 1,100 feet.

348
00:49:08,910 --> 00:49:10,090
[SPEAKER_15]: Almost 1,100 feet.

349
00:49:10,110 --> 00:49:10,330
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

350
00:49:11,411 --> 00:49:12,991
[SPEAKER_15]: You said something at the beginning of your presentation.

351
00:49:13,012 --> 00:49:16,073
[SPEAKER_15]: You said this is going to be common trench work like you see all around the city.

352
00:49:16,653 --> 00:49:21,498
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've had a big problem in this city about trench work that's being performed by public utilities in the community.

353
00:49:22,539 --> 00:49:29,765
[SPEAKER_15]: Just last month we had a committee of the whole meeting with the city engineer and we asked a series of questions to the city solicitor as to whether or not we could place a moratorium on trench work.

354
00:49:30,546 --> 00:49:34,950
[SPEAKER_15]: One of the big problems isn't necessarily you guys getting in there and doing the work that you need to do because you need to get the work done.

355
00:49:35,491 --> 00:49:38,994
[SPEAKER_15]: It's never coming back and fixing it to the standard that we want to see it fixed.

356
00:49:39,614 --> 00:49:57,498
[SPEAKER_15]: That's become a very big problem in our community We're seeing a number of streets in residential neighborhoods the end and main roads alike, but again pulling up and torn apart I mean if you look at tonight's agenda for example We got 115 feet coming up after that and we're looking at 2,000 feet of trench work that we're gonna be putting through the city You know what?

357
00:49:57,518 --> 00:49:57,699
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean?

358
00:49:57,739 --> 00:50:03,340
[SPEAKER_15]: There's applications for 2,000 feet of trench work in the city and we have some questions that are pending right now before our

359
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:23,084
[SPEAKER_15]: Solicitor that I think I'd feel a little bit more comfortable getting an answer to before I move forward and supporting this paper You know a thousand feet a lot of a lot of stretch on the end It's ten football fields councillor de la rusa was absolutely right that neighborhood has been beat on for the last three four years between you know the reversals of Winchester Street in the direction that it's going in and

360
00:50:23,665 --> 00:50:36,820
[SPEAKER_15]: the impact that the expansions of the Harvard Street Bridge have had, the discussion about eminent domain land takings coming up in the near future to, again, accommodate the extension of the Greenland, which I think is going to be a benefit to our community, don't get me wrong.

361
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:39,203
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the Greenland extension is a good thing for us here in Medford.

362
00:50:39,503 --> 00:50:45,028
[SPEAKER_15]: But in the meantime, we have residents that really need to maintain a strong quality of life, and that hasn't happened in that neighborhood.

363
00:50:45,048 --> 00:50:53,636
[SPEAKER_15]: So this evening, I'm having a very difficult time supporting this paper, Mr. President, if we don't have the answers that are going to come back from the city solicitor based on the committee of the whole that we had.

364
00:50:53,977 --> 00:51:00,423
[SPEAKER_15]: And the committee of the whole meeting that we had was exclusively focused on trench management and the issuing of permits to public utilities and what they do to our streets.

365
00:51:01,023 --> 00:51:18,306
[SPEAKER_15]: and whether or not they come back, and whether or not there's a schedule for them to come back, and whether or not we can limit the number of permits that are issued in a quarter or a year, so that we can better manage the job and better oversee the job that's being done, because I think that the focus is more on the next special permit than it is on coming back and completing the work from the last special permit that you got.

366
00:51:18,686 --> 00:51:23,707
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, I haven't had the opportunity of working with Siena, and I'm not sure what Siena's reputation is or anything like that.

367
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:24,687
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure you guys are great.

368
00:51:24,727 --> 00:51:29,628
[SPEAKER_15]: You're working for AT&T, which is a multinational company, you know, a billion dollar company, so I'm sure you guys do a great job.

369
00:51:30,408 --> 00:51:36,151
[SPEAKER_15]: But we need to do some housekeeping here, in my opinion, before I feel comfortable supporting this paper.

370
00:51:36,271 --> 00:51:51,239
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm not going to be able to support it this evening, Mr. President, for the reasons that we've asked a series of questions to our city solicitor through the administration, asking for some input and some feedback as to what we can do to better manage the trench work that's being done in our community, because it's killing our streets, it's killing our neighborhoods.

371
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:56,282
[SPEAKER_15]: And the residents are speaking out against it in this particular street, in this particular neighborhood.

372
00:51:56,702 --> 00:51:59,644
[SPEAKER_15]: They've been under the thumb of construction for the better part of three years.

373
00:51:59,984 --> 00:52:02,646
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's not going to stop.

374
00:52:03,106 --> 00:52:04,407
[SPEAKER_15]: And the work needs to get done, I understand.

375
00:52:04,427 --> 00:52:12,231
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, unfortunately we're on a schedule here where we're getting forced to relocate because we're in the way of the apartment that's going to go in.

376
00:52:14,032 --> 00:52:17,755
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is the way to get around that so that they can do that construction work.

377
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:22,256
[SPEAKER_11]: that's what's pushing us to get this work done.

378
00:52:22,296 --> 00:52:25,937
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand that it's a cause and effect situation, I guess you'd call it.

379
00:52:25,957 --> 00:52:31,398
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we're on the right of way, and we happen to be on the right of way in the wrong spot.

380
00:52:31,498 --> 00:52:38,660
[SPEAKER_11]: We're at the apartment where the bridge needs to be replaced, and this is the way to get around that so that they can move forward with their construction in December.

381
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:44,342
[SPEAKER_15]: In this alternative here that's being presented, I would assume would be the least costly alternative to the provider, right?

382
00:52:45,682 --> 00:52:49,944
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if it would be the least costly, but it certainly is.

383
00:52:49,964 --> 00:52:51,024
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there another way you can do it?

384
00:52:51,044 --> 00:52:54,085
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't have to dig 1,000 feet in one of our city streets, I guess is the question.

385
00:52:54,745 --> 00:52:57,386
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think that there is another way that we could do that.

386
00:52:57,406 --> 00:53:00,787
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know that we could get our cable out of the way of the construction.

387
00:53:00,827 --> 00:53:03,168
[SPEAKER_10]: You might be able to speak to that a little bit better than I could.

388
00:53:04,008 --> 00:53:08,931
[SPEAKER_10]: Derek Anderson with our design professional representing MBTA 16 Myrtle Street in Medford.

389
00:53:09,531 --> 00:53:12,893
[SPEAKER_10]: So I understand some of the trenching problems on a personal level.

390
00:53:12,993 --> 00:53:25,900
[SPEAKER_10]: But to why I'm here, yeah, we have, the design team has looked at multiple different ways to keep the relocation of this particular duct bank within the MBTA right away under the bridge.

391
00:53:27,281 --> 00:53:36,494
[SPEAKER_10]: There is not a way that we have seen where we're able to avoid any disruption to the public streets in the area, the Boston Ave or Winchester.

392
00:53:36,535 --> 00:53:40,520
[SPEAKER_10]: Winchester seems to be the best possible alignment for getting in and out quickly.

393
00:53:42,202 --> 00:53:43,744
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, we've looked at those.

394
00:53:44,505 --> 00:53:49,089
[SPEAKER_10]: To give some sense, Broadway Bridge, there's abutments coming down on either side, a new track.

395
00:53:49,109 --> 00:53:51,851
[SPEAKER_10]: There's just no space between the abutments and the track to put that in.

396
00:53:51,972 --> 00:53:53,193
[SPEAKER_15]: There's barely any space between U.S.

397
00:53:53,213 --> 00:53:55,835
[SPEAKER_15]: Travel World and, you know, from what they've done over there.

398
00:53:55,915 --> 00:53:58,598
[SPEAKER_15]: It's far away from the building, so I understand why you're not looking at it.

399
00:53:58,638 --> 00:54:02,682
[SPEAKER_10]: We have absolutely looked to try to avoid disruption in this area.

400
00:54:03,262 --> 00:54:04,964
[SPEAKER_10]: There isn't another way without getting into the roads.

401
00:54:08,866 --> 00:54:10,527
[SPEAKER_15]: Or can you go underneath the real bed?

402
00:54:10,587 --> 00:54:12,608
[SPEAKER_15]: Can you go through some holes?

403
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:16,230
[SPEAKER_10]: One way or another, it's got to come up onto the roads.

404
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:20,512
[SPEAKER_15]: And really, Winchester is... And what do these conduits service?

405
00:54:20,892 --> 00:54:22,093
[SPEAKER_15]: Are they home telephones?

406
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:23,433
[SPEAKER_15]: Are they internet IP?

407
00:54:24,194 --> 00:54:24,654
[SPEAKER_15]: Bandwidth?

408
00:54:24,934 --> 00:54:26,195
[SPEAKER_15]: What do they provide?

409
00:54:26,215 --> 00:54:28,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it's AT&T's core...

410
00:54:29,996 --> 00:54:40,900
[SPEAKER_11]: network, and it's carrying all kinds of traffic that is not only local, but it goes all over the place.

411
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:46,942
[SPEAKER_11]: This particular cable has quite a bit of traffic on it that can't be rerouted, unfortunately.

412
00:54:47,782 --> 00:54:57,406
[SPEAKER_11]: The right-of-way was a place where they traditionally put a lot of network as a way to mitigate getting into town and city streets.

413
00:54:58,471 --> 00:55:04,439
[SPEAKER_11]: And unfortunately, where it is right now, we don't have the ability to get it out of his way while he builds the bridge.

414
00:55:05,341 --> 00:55:07,584
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is a way to work it out.

415
00:55:07,624 --> 00:55:14,133
[SPEAKER_11]: And we are taking advantage of some structures that are already there and going through, coming out of the horizon.

416
00:55:18,116 --> 00:55:19,437
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate you for answering my questions.

417
00:55:19,497 --> 00:55:26,702
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think my position is moving much off of Mr. President, although the answer is from the solicitor's office.

418
00:55:26,722 --> 00:55:28,703
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate coming out tonight.

419
00:55:29,124 --> 00:55:32,886
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's one of the biggest things that we've talked about in this council.

420
00:55:32,906 --> 00:55:39,310
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry that you have a representative of this feedback, but until we make a stand,

421
00:55:40,711 --> 00:55:56,189
[SPEAKER_14]: and really get the feedback back from the city solicitor and all of the utility companies that have been using our streets as trenches and then walking away and leaving our streets a mess.

422
00:55:57,370 --> 00:55:59,512
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that with that and

423
00:56:00,493 --> 00:56:21,952
[SPEAKER_14]: plan in place for those neighbors because those neighbors again, I echo the remarks of my colleagues that they've been impacted so negatively and They're just daily daily Lifestyles and to compound that with more construction road work without a comprehensive plan that they are familiar with from beginning to end I think would be

424
00:56:23,293 --> 00:56:41,465
[SPEAKER_14]: would be negligent and my part as a city council representing those people to not make sure that those concerns are not just supported by yourself, but a plan that would show us and what we can do.

425
00:56:41,545 --> 00:56:51,992
[SPEAKER_14]: So I too would like to table this until we get more information from our city solicitor and what we've asked for in the past for our utilities

426
00:56:52,592 --> 00:56:59,695
[SPEAKER_14]: to make sure that what's being done on our roads, that utilities are being held accountable for what they're leaving there.

427
00:56:59,755 --> 00:57:07,998
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we'd certainly work with you guys on whatever you needed to be, you know, comfortable with our construction practice.

428
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:18,982
[SPEAKER_11]: anything we'd need to do to help communicate with the neighbours, all the people that are impacted, we'd certainly be willing to do that.

429
00:57:19,342 --> 00:57:34,248
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I apologize that you could be the one situation where it would leave the street impeccable, but when you have two foot swaths being cut and then you see them dip and nobody comes back to fix them and then

430
00:57:35,347 --> 00:57:43,517
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, someone comes in and builds a four foot swap path and nobody comes back and this is what we are hearing over and over again.

431
00:57:44,358 --> 00:57:48,162
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is where it has been very frustrating for us.

432
00:57:49,103 --> 00:57:50,365
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you for your time.

433
00:57:50,385 --> 00:57:51,546
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate it.

434
00:57:55,202 --> 00:58:02,829
[SPEAKER_27]: I think some of the frustration you're hearing is regarding the number of projects that this city has gone through over the last couple of years.

435
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:15,920
[SPEAKER_27]: Eversource right now will be trenching two miles of some of our major thoroughfares in the next several months, which is going to be a big disruption to traffic and residents in this community.

436
00:58:17,721 --> 00:58:40,797
[SPEAKER_27]: My question to you is we hear all too often when we ask when a trench is dug and we all know after even with best intentions It usually sinks after a period of time and we've asked the city Solicitor why we can't request that when you're digging a trench that you've not only just paved the trench but

437
00:58:40,977 --> 00:58:43,218
[SPEAKER_27]: but you do a curb-to-curb restoration.

438
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:46,319
[SPEAKER_27]: And we're being told that we can't request that.

439
00:58:47,479 --> 00:58:53,542
[SPEAKER_27]: And I believe it has something to do with state law, correct me if I'm wrong, but we can't request a curb-to-curb repaving.

440
00:58:54,182 --> 00:59:02,265
[SPEAKER_27]: And in my opinion, if I allowed you to dig up some of my driveway, to put something under my driveway, I wouldn't request that you just patch a little piece of my driveway,

441
00:59:02,525 --> 00:59:04,566
[SPEAKER_27]: Because I know what's going to happen in six months from now.

442
00:59:04,846 --> 00:59:06,067
[SPEAKER_27]: My driveway's going to be a mess.

443
00:59:06,547 --> 00:59:08,508
[SPEAKER_27]: And the same thing applies to our streets.

444
00:59:08,888 --> 00:59:13,109
[SPEAKER_27]: So that's the first thing I think we have to look at, why we can't request a curb-to-curb.

445
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:16,451
[SPEAKER_27]: Was a curb-to-curb requested in this particular case?

446
00:59:16,731 --> 00:59:18,732
[SPEAKER_11]: It was not requested in this particular case.

447
00:59:19,372 --> 00:59:27,315
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, if you had something that was wrong with our patch, for instance, we certainly would want to try to restore the patch.

448
00:59:27,736 --> 00:59:30,897
[SPEAKER_27]: So if the city did request a curb-to-curb, would you

449
00:59:32,966 --> 00:59:38,192
[SPEAKER_11]: That's something that I would have to bring back to see if that's something that would be an option.

450
00:59:38,232 --> 00:59:41,797
[SPEAKER_11]: That would certainly be quite a big impact to the project.

451
00:59:42,678 --> 00:59:46,583
[SPEAKER_11]: But maybe, I don't know if it's something that we could do.

452
00:59:46,803 --> 00:59:48,165
[SPEAKER_11]: I couldn't answer that question tonight.

453
00:59:52,110 --> 00:59:56,477
[SPEAKER_11]: It would be a bigger impact overall to the neighborhood as well.

454
00:59:56,497 --> 01:00:05,531
[SPEAKER_11]: I understand that if we did have to do a full restoration for the entire trench, the trench line, that we would be looking at a pretty big impact.

455
01:00:08,486 --> 01:00:24,023
[SPEAKER_27]: For the neighbors and everybody the construction project would be bigger than it would be Sure sure residents who call us up in six months from now saying every truck that goes by their house shakes their house because it's such a dip

456
01:00:24,543 --> 01:00:25,884
[SPEAKER_27]: You know, we hear it over and over again.

457
01:00:25,944 --> 01:00:26,445
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, right.

458
01:00:26,845 --> 01:00:41,717
[SPEAKER_11]: So, I can appreciate the fact that... No, I understand that the roads are all over, you know, all over the state there's construction work going on and it's frustrating for everybody at times and patches to resettle and that's, there's no question about it that that happens.

459
01:00:44,298 --> 01:00:51,062
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know that I can say that I'd be able to do a full restoration this evening, but I could certainly inquire about it.

460
01:00:51,142 --> 01:00:54,763
[SPEAKER_27]: We don't meet again until September, third week in September.

461
01:00:55,163 --> 01:01:00,006
[SPEAKER_27]: Yeah, and my concern is that if we don't... We're not going to meet until the third week in September.

462
01:01:00,106 --> 01:01:10,911
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, right, and that's my concern is that, you know, with the project, with the goals that they have for the bridge, that we're running out of time to get this project done.

463
01:01:11,911 --> 01:01:13,852
[SPEAKER_27]: Well, I is one member of the council.

464
01:01:13,912 --> 01:01:19,233
[SPEAKER_27]: I'd hate to hold up this project I understand that you're doing the project based on what work needs to be done, right?

465
01:01:20,713 --> 01:01:41,358
[SPEAKER_27]: I Would have no problem if you would be able to give us a commitment tonight about curb-to-curb restoration That way I think would be an easier sell to the neighborhood knowing that this work is taking place But the ultimate outcome will be a brand new area street from the whole length You know, we go through projects like this

466
01:01:41,498 --> 01:01:46,580
[SPEAKER_27]: the EverSource project I mentioned two months, it has zero benefit to this community.

467
01:01:47,280 --> 01:01:47,700
[SPEAKER_27]: Zero.

468
01:01:49,000 --> 01:01:57,223
[SPEAKER_27]: I realize we all have to live together as good neighbors with other communities, but it has zero benefit to our community and it's going to have a thousand percent disruption to our community.

469
01:01:57,803 --> 01:02:00,105
[SPEAKER_27]: So those are the type of things I think we're struggling with.

470
01:02:00,145 --> 01:02:01,706
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I understand.

471
01:02:01,906 --> 01:02:04,347
[SPEAKER_27]: I'd be supportive tonight if you would give a commitment.

472
01:02:04,868 --> 01:02:08,410
[SPEAKER_27]: If you can get on your phone, give a commitment for a curb-to-curb restoration.

473
01:02:08,490 --> 01:02:12,313
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that something that I could come back in, if I could get a few minutes and see what I can do?

474
01:02:12,333 --> 01:02:13,934
[SPEAKER_27]: If the members feel the same, I feel that way.

475
01:02:14,474 --> 01:02:20,178
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that would be a win for our community if we were able to repave the entire area.

476
01:02:22,187 --> 01:02:22,447
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

477
01:02:23,207 --> 01:02:23,928
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Dello Russo.

478
01:02:24,108 --> 01:02:30,631
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I wouldn't be so strict as to require that.

479
01:02:31,131 --> 01:02:32,352
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd certainly invite it.

480
01:02:33,832 --> 01:02:39,135
[SPEAKER_19]: I am intimately aware that neighbors, that's the neighborhood I live in.

481
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:49,840
[SPEAKER_19]: I know what my neighbors have been going through and I've been working on this as the city's liaison on one of the city's liaisons on this Green Line Extension project for

482
01:02:52,524 --> 01:02:56,467
[SPEAKER_19]: 12 years, 14 years, something like that.

483
01:02:57,288 --> 01:03:01,811
[SPEAKER_19]: And they're finally digging, they're finally going, and we want to get it done.

484
01:03:02,472 --> 01:03:03,613
[SPEAKER_19]: People want to see it done.

485
01:03:05,746 --> 01:03:10,410
[SPEAKER_19]: And so I wouldn't want to be part of impeding construction.

486
01:03:11,851 --> 01:03:15,574
[SPEAKER_19]: And I can only imagine that Winthrop Street will be dug up again.

487
01:03:15,594 --> 01:03:26,703
[SPEAKER_19]: And certainly our neighbors up there will be dealing with the ambient noise of ongoing construction for the next several years with the construction of the station.

488
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:48,964
[SPEAKER_19]: the rail bed, and then also the continued presence of the lower line moving eight, what was it, 18, 27 feet closer to their homes, and then the squeaks and the clickety-clacks of the Green Line streetcars.

489
01:03:49,404 --> 01:03:52,688
[SPEAKER_19]: So, that being said, I,

490
01:03:55,047 --> 01:04:12,622
[SPEAKER_19]: I'd like to see curb-to-curb restoration of the street, but I also know that that might involve its own inconveniences to the people, but my concern was chiefly on their having avenues of communication.

491
01:04:13,242 --> 01:04:32,723
[SPEAKER_19]: in a way to get assurances that the concerns are going to be met, but I'll gladly yield to my dear colleagues and support that, but I certainly don't want to, I don't see a need to table this tonight, nor do I see a need to withhold it.

492
01:04:34,172 --> 01:04:38,199
[SPEAKER_19]: and whole so I would like to move on it decisively tonight.

493
01:04:38,820 --> 01:04:39,501
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

494
01:04:47,160 --> 01:04:55,642
[SPEAKER_15]: Based upon your plans and construction guidelines and so forth, do you see a need to do any more underground work on Winchester or Granville before the completion of the Green Line extension?

495
01:04:56,442 --> 01:05:03,023
[SPEAKER_10]: As part of this project, we're not anticipating utility work on Winchester or Granville.

496
01:05:03,623 --> 01:05:08,344
[SPEAKER_15]: Because part of the concern would be if we did go curb to curb, then that would put in effect a moratorium for digging.

497
01:05:08,465 --> 01:05:10,205
[SPEAKER_15]: So we require to go curb to curb.

498
01:05:11,245 --> 01:05:14,386
[SPEAKER_15]: and paved the whole entire street, then we could say that they can't think for five years.

499
01:05:14,446 --> 01:05:17,746
[SPEAKER_11]: Are there other plans for other utilities to work through that area?

500
01:05:17,806 --> 01:05:19,347
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know the answer to that question.

501
01:05:19,387 --> 01:05:21,607
[SPEAKER_11]: That's why it's better for them to do it the new way.

502
01:05:21,727 --> 01:05:23,648
[SPEAKER_11]: I see if that's the way to do it.

503
01:05:23,668 --> 01:05:26,228
[SPEAKER_19]: They did the water and gas, that was two years ago, three years ago.

504
01:05:26,248 --> 01:05:30,189
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

505
01:05:31,089 --> 01:05:32,609
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

506
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:39,611
[SPEAKER_05]: I see everybody's frustration, and we've had a number of Committee of the Whole meetings to try to remedy it, and we are awaiting answers.

507
01:05:41,146 --> 01:05:55,079
[SPEAKER_05]: Curb to curb will be great, but for me, what I keep bringing up in the last several years that this has been a real problem is the fact that we don't have anybody from the city to review the trench work six months from now, a year from now.

508
01:05:55,579 --> 01:05:59,343
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, I'd be amenable as long as we have a condition on there that

509
01:06:00,183 --> 01:06:09,309
[SPEAKER_05]: engineer or somebody from the administration does a walk-through with somebody from your company nine months from now or a year from now and if there is sinkage that it be fixed.

510
01:06:09,930 --> 01:06:12,912
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that might be another option.

511
01:06:14,153 --> 01:06:16,554
[SPEAKER_14]: I think everybody touched some great points.

512
01:06:18,075 --> 01:06:29,463
[SPEAKER_14]: the more detailed agenda for our constituents and those neighbours that are going to be affected, I think would have to be something that's necessary.

513
01:06:29,583 --> 01:06:31,704
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, we definitely are interested in that.

514
01:06:32,305 --> 01:06:39,250
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I did talk to the city engineer and that was one of the points that she brought up is that we did have to meet before we got started.

515
01:06:39,270 --> 01:06:43,893
[SPEAKER_11]: We were going to have a construction kick-off and I think we could address some of those concerns with the neighbourhood.

516
01:06:44,513 --> 01:06:49,355
[SPEAKER_11]: and I've actually been given the okay to do curb-to-curb if you guys would like us to do the curb-to-curb, so.

517
01:06:50,376 --> 01:06:57,939
[SPEAKER_26]: In the petition, it says AT&T shall provide a full-time resident engineer approved by the city who will monitor the work on the city's behalf.

518
01:06:57,979 --> 01:07:04,102
[SPEAKER_26]: AT&T will provide detailed scheduled weekly updates, so it is in our context somewhat.

519
01:07:04,502 --> 01:07:05,062
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight.

520
01:07:05,582 --> 01:07:08,163
[SPEAKER_16]: So you just said that you've gotten the authority to do curb-to-curb?

521
01:07:08,203 --> 01:07:11,305
[SPEAKER_11]: I have, I've gotten the approval to do curb-to-curb if you guys would like to do it.

522
01:07:12,005 --> 01:07:14,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I elaborate on my response?

523
01:07:14,366 --> 01:07:14,906
[SPEAKER_10]: Please.

524
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:28,330
[SPEAKER_10]: As you know, this is a design build, so when I say that we're not anticipating any work there, I can't say that there won't be any work, because I don't know what the design build is that was proposed, but we're not anticipating work there.

525
01:07:29,391 --> 01:07:32,972
[SPEAKER_15]: I anticipate it, and the other question I have was would

526
01:07:34,998 --> 01:07:37,341
[SPEAKER_15]: You have a pre-construction meeting, obviously, with our engineering department.

527
01:07:37,361 --> 01:07:37,821
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

528
01:07:37,881 --> 01:07:38,682
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

529
01:07:38,702 --> 01:07:44,608
[SPEAKER_15]: Would you be willing to have a pre-construction meeting at maybe the South Metro Fire Station with the same people that are the abutters that are on your abuttal list?

530
01:07:44,709 --> 01:07:45,590
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, absolutely.

531
01:07:45,610 --> 01:07:45,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Why not?

532
01:07:46,050 --> 01:07:48,413
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we certainly want to keep everybody happy.

533
01:07:48,433 --> 01:07:52,917
[SPEAKER_11]: We're interested in having good neighbors and keeping everybody as happy as we can.

534
01:07:52,958 --> 01:07:54,259
[SPEAKER_11]: We are going to be constructing.

535
01:07:54,279 --> 01:07:55,741
[SPEAKER_11]: We are going to be impacting traffic.

536
01:07:55,761 --> 01:07:56,682
[SPEAKER_11]: That's unavoidable.

537
01:07:57,302 --> 01:08:02,883
[SPEAKER_11]: but we're interested in getting the project done as quickly as possible with the least amount of disruption.

538
01:08:04,083 --> 01:08:05,884
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, I think we're making good progress tonight.

539
01:08:06,024 --> 01:08:13,845
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, a curb-to-curb solution is something that... So it's just my agreement that you're agreeing to a curb-to-curb?

540
01:08:13,925 --> 01:08:15,126
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we're in agreement.

541
01:08:15,166 --> 01:08:17,166
[SPEAKER_16]: And so could we have that as a condition?

542
01:08:17,966 --> 01:08:19,947
[SPEAKER_16]: If you could put that as a condition, Mr. President.

543
01:08:19,967 --> 01:08:24,207
[SPEAKER_16]: And just another condition that there's a meeting that's held for construction with the residents that are at Butters.

544
01:08:24,688 --> 01:08:26,588
[SPEAKER_16]: At Butters, Upper Butters.

545
01:08:28,049 --> 01:08:30,891
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

546
01:08:31,011 --> 01:08:35,275
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

547
01:08:35,555 --> 01:08:37,217
[SPEAKER_26]: As amended.

548
01:08:37,737 --> 01:08:38,338
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

549
01:08:38,658 --> 01:08:38,978
[SPEAKER_24]: Aye.

550
01:08:38,998 --> 01:08:40,180
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

551
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,062
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Scarpelli has requested a roll call.

552
01:08:46,005 --> 01:08:50,048
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

553
01:08:54,905 --> 01:08:55,745
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Dello Russo?

554
01:08:55,785 --> 01:08:56,046
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

555
01:08:56,606 --> 01:08:57,266
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Falco?

556
01:08:57,326 --> 01:08:57,586
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

557
01:08:58,026 --> 01:08:58,527
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight?

558
01:08:58,607 --> 01:08:58,867
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

559
01:08:59,407 --> 01:09:00,067
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Lungo-Koehnan?

560
01:09:00,107 --> 01:09:00,347
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

561
01:09:00,367 --> 01:09:01,688
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President March?

562
01:09:02,028 --> 01:09:02,308
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

563
01:09:02,828 --> 01:09:03,609
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli?

564
01:09:03,749 --> 01:09:04,009
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

565
01:09:04,209 --> 01:09:05,349
[SPEAKER_26]: President Caraviello?

566
01:09:05,430 --> 01:09:05,690
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

567
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:08,491
[SPEAKER_26]: Seven in the affirmative, nine in the negative.

568
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:09,231
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

569
01:09:09,251 --> 01:09:10,292
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much.

570
01:09:10,452 --> 01:09:10,752
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

571
01:09:10,792 --> 01:09:11,332
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you guys.

572
01:09:18,904 --> 01:09:23,690
[SPEAKER_26]: 17, 593, location of poles, attachment of fictions, and underground conduits.

573
01:09:24,251 --> 01:09:28,916
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, motion to waive the reading and have a representative from the petitioner give a brief synopsis of the project.

574
01:09:28,997 --> 01:09:30,919
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm not going to say it, this is Comcast again.

575
01:09:33,013 --> 01:09:35,775
[SPEAKER_15]: Name and address of the record, please.

576
01:09:36,176 --> 01:09:38,277
[SPEAKER_18]: Dave Pauling, Comcast, moving Massachusetts.

577
01:09:38,538 --> 01:09:40,079
[SPEAKER_18]: And you are here in favor of this project?

578
01:09:40,119 --> 01:09:40,499
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I am.

579
01:09:40,839 --> 01:09:42,781
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we have anyone else here in favor of that project?

580
01:09:43,521 --> 01:09:46,043
[SPEAKER_26]: Hearing and seeing none, I close that part of the hearing.

581
01:09:46,403 --> 01:09:48,985
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we have anyone here against this project?

582
01:09:50,226 --> 01:09:53,429
[SPEAKER_26]: Hearing and seeing none, I close that section of the hearing.

583
01:09:54,599 --> 01:09:54,859
[SPEAKER_17]: continue.

584
01:09:55,339 --> 01:10:03,462
[SPEAKER_17]: High Street, placing a new 4x4 manhole over the existing Comcast conduit at the intersection of High Street and Hillside Avenue.

585
01:10:04,442 --> 01:10:15,385
[SPEAKER_17]: From the newly placed manhole, excavating to place a 4-inch PVC conduit 115 feet plus or minus and continuing into 92 High Street, Medford, which is the Armory building.

586
01:10:16,526 --> 01:10:19,930
[SPEAKER_17]: They've requested our service and this is the plan to provide service to them.

587
01:10:19,970 --> 01:10:22,674
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

588
01:10:22,714 --> 01:10:23,375
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Falco.

589
01:10:23,955 --> 01:10:24,296
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

590
01:10:24,316 --> 01:10:25,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

591
01:10:25,818 --> 01:10:32,266
[SPEAKER_02]: Similar to a lot of the questions I asked previously regarding that previous project, when will the work take place and how long will this project last?

592
01:10:36,147 --> 01:10:41,631
[SPEAKER_17]: Once approved, if approved, we're still waiting for an MWRA permit that they have.

593
01:10:42,131 --> 01:10:43,533
[SPEAKER_17]: We have received the permit.

594
01:10:43,573 --> 01:10:44,733
[SPEAKER_17]: We have signed off on it.

595
01:10:44,853 --> 01:10:45,574
[SPEAKER_17]: We've reviewed it.

596
01:10:45,794 --> 01:10:46,615
[SPEAKER_17]: We've agreed to it.

597
01:10:47,395 --> 01:10:48,936
[SPEAKER_17]: It's back with the MWRA.

598
01:10:48,977 --> 01:10:52,019
[SPEAKER_17]: They have a new process now where we sign off on the permit first.

599
01:10:52,499 --> 01:10:57,181
[SPEAKER_17]: then we send it back to them and it basically goes through their board again, takes two weeks to get it signed.

600
01:10:57,241 --> 01:11:02,444
[SPEAKER_17]: So I was hoping to get this work done if approved before Labor Day, before school started.

601
01:11:02,944 --> 01:11:07,847
[SPEAKER_17]: However, it looks like it's gonna be sometime after Labor Day before we get that MWRA permit from them.

602
01:11:10,028 --> 01:11:15,750
[SPEAKER_17]: The work should take, depending upon the digging, it is only 115 feet and a four by four manhole.

603
01:11:16,511 --> 01:11:20,593
[SPEAKER_17]: I would say probably a week, depending upon the digging, weather permitting.

604
01:11:22,291 --> 01:11:27,954
[SPEAKER_17]: two weeks, maybe tops, it's kind of hard to say, not knowing exactly what's in there and what they're going to run into as far as the digging.

605
01:11:28,955 --> 01:11:30,315
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's on High Street, right?

606
01:11:30,516 --> 01:11:30,696
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

607
01:11:30,756 --> 01:11:38,260
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume the road's going to be open, but I would imagine it's going to be probably tough to pass at times, I would think.

608
01:11:38,947 --> 01:11:46,593
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I did see I printed the agenda this morning and I did look at this and I did see that the chief engineer requested a traffic management plan.

609
01:11:46,633 --> 01:11:50,276
[SPEAKER_17]: I did also request that today from our traffic management people.

610
01:11:50,336 --> 01:12:02,125
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm hoping to get that and, you know, shortly after Labor Day, I'll be able to, you know, bring that into the chief engineer and we can talk about if approved, moving forward with the with the work.

611
01:12:02,145 --> 01:12:03,427
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

612
01:12:04,911 --> 01:12:10,053
[SPEAKER_17]: There is a chance that on Hillside Avenue, the existing conduit may be damaged.

613
01:12:10,794 --> 01:12:18,497
[SPEAKER_17]: So I thought that I should put this in here and make you aware of that just in case we do have to do some additional excavating on that road.

614
01:12:19,477 --> 01:12:25,000
[SPEAKER_17]: So there would be no surprises if this project does extend a little bit longer than anticipated.

615
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:28,361
[SPEAKER_17]: Hopefully we can get through that conduit, but we think it may be damaged.

616
01:12:28,401 --> 01:12:30,102
[SPEAKER_26]: What information, Councilor Scarpelli?

617
01:12:30,202 --> 01:12:32,203
[SPEAKER_14]: How many more feet would that be if there was damage?

618
01:12:33,747 --> 01:12:35,028
[SPEAKER_17]: I would have to look at the plan here.

619
01:12:35,128 --> 01:12:44,471
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not sure if he called that out.

620
01:12:44,491 --> 01:12:44,971
[SPEAKER_17]: 180 feet.

621
01:12:46,232 --> 01:12:47,853
[SPEAKER_17]: An additional 180 or 180 total?

622
01:12:47,893 --> 01:12:48,313
[SPEAKER_17]: Additional 180.

623
01:12:48,353 --> 01:12:53,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, so with that additional 180 feet, so how long that work would take if you have to

624
01:13:02,397 --> 01:13:03,838
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, it depends upon the digging.

625
01:13:03,899 --> 01:13:12,947
[SPEAKER_17]: I know that's kind of off the, you know, not as busy a street as High Street, but, you know, I'm sure there's a lot of traffic that goes up and down to that area, and I believe, is it the library that's right there also?

626
01:13:12,967 --> 01:13:23,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the library exits from there, and there's a couple of streets that are up in that area, so those neighbors, those residents will be impacted, it sounds like, if there is

627
01:13:24,158 --> 01:13:25,280
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm hoping we can get through it.

628
01:13:25,320 --> 01:13:31,928
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll send a crew out there before we stop this, before we start the digging out on the main run, to see if we can get a rod through it.

629
01:13:32,488 --> 01:13:38,315
[SPEAKER_17]: Best case scenario, maybe it's just damaged in a couple of spots and we have to, you know, pothole it and dig it up and repair it.

630
01:13:39,156 --> 01:13:40,458
[SPEAKER_17]: That would be the best case scenario.

631
01:13:42,387 --> 01:13:42,687
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

632
01:13:42,987 --> 01:13:43,167
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

633
01:13:43,287 --> 01:13:43,828
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.

634
01:13:44,868 --> 01:13:46,749
[SPEAKER_16]: Sir, when we just did the last permit.

635
01:13:47,229 --> 01:13:47,469
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

636
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:55,093
[SPEAKER_15]: And can we have some of your feelings concerning a curb to curb pave on this project as opposed to a trench and patch in a crowd?

637
01:13:55,233 --> 01:14:02,237
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, again, I did see that in the comments from the chief engineer and it did call that out from trench.

638
01:14:03,597 --> 01:14:28,925
[SPEAKER_17]: To pay from the trench to the curb I would also I would need to go back if this was approved I would go back and just make them aware of that that that would be the requirement of the permit and Therefore it would be a business decision on our end if we were to move forward and then physically go apply for the permit so if it was approved tonight and we agreed it was agreed to you know grant the location and

639
01:14:29,605 --> 01:14:43,332
[SPEAKER_17]: And then if I go back and the powers to be decide that this is cost prohibitive to do the paving to the curb, then therefore we would not apply for the street opening permit and not provide service to 92 High Street.

640
01:14:45,493 --> 01:14:51,876
[SPEAKER_05]: Through the chair, President Caraviello, so 92 High Street doesn't have Comcast service at all?

641
01:14:51,956 --> 01:14:52,317
[SPEAKER_17]: They don't.

642
01:14:53,718 --> 01:14:54,578
[SPEAKER_05]: And who's requesting it?

643
01:14:54,598 --> 01:14:55,179
[SPEAKER_05]: The whole building?

644
01:14:55,199 --> 01:14:56,039
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have the name.

645
01:14:57,279 --> 01:14:58,540
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't have the name of the customer.

646
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:01,120
[SPEAKER_17]: I was just tasked with getting the permits to get to the building.

647
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:06,282
[SPEAKER_17]: And then once it's there, X number of tenants within that building could request the service.

648
01:15:06,302 --> 01:15:08,243
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's at least one.

649
01:15:11,041 --> 01:15:11,421
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you.

650
01:15:11,862 --> 01:15:12,963
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor, Vice President Mox.

651
01:15:13,443 --> 01:15:18,467
[SPEAKER_27]: I believe, and I stand to be corrected, it may be a new dental group that's moving in that's requesting this.

652
01:15:19,768 --> 01:15:27,574
[SPEAKER_27]: And I would hate for Comcast to go back and then decide it was not cost effective to provide service.

653
01:15:28,095 --> 01:15:35,981
[SPEAKER_27]: This new business is just opening and actually reached out to me as one member of the council, seeing when it was gonna be on our agenda.

654
01:15:36,521 --> 01:15:40,665
[SPEAKER_27]: So, they're really interested in getting the service to get their business up and running.

655
01:15:40,685 --> 01:15:51,215
[SPEAKER_27]: So, at this point, I would, as one member of the council, just support the current work that's going on and then we can have other discussions regarding curve to curve and so forth.

656
01:15:59,567 --> 01:16:02,408
[SPEAKER_14]: with the same issues that I've had.

657
01:16:02,928 --> 01:16:27,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, this is a little different because it does affect constituents that need to move forward, but if approved, the same stipulation, would the residents, would you require that, would you input a plan that residents would hear, would understand the total agenda from beginning to end so they understand the

658
01:16:28,738 --> 01:16:32,522
[SPEAKER_14]: complexities of the project and any issues or concerns that might come up.

659
01:16:33,603 --> 01:16:39,969
[SPEAKER_17]: Are you saying having someone on site or just having a point of contact for the project?

660
01:16:39,989 --> 01:16:42,271
[SPEAKER_14]: We have had a point of contact.

661
01:16:44,765 --> 01:16:56,050
[SPEAKER_14]: reaching out to the residents and same thing, holding a meeting or getting a detailed agenda for them, schedule for them so they understand what might happen.

662
01:16:56,550 --> 01:17:04,794
[SPEAKER_14]: At least the abutters to this project understand the complexity of the job.

663
01:17:05,334 --> 01:17:06,035
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we could do that.

664
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:25,287
[SPEAKER_15]: There's a location that you're requesting to dig, and I'm sure you're from around the Woburn area, so I'm sure you're familiar with the area, but right at that particular location, there were points in time where there were two MBTA buses that are driving down the street and they can't even get by each other.

665
01:17:27,149 --> 01:17:34,600
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very difficult to see what impact this is really going to have on the traffic flow in the square and the business district.

666
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:41,149
[SPEAKER_15]: We had a gentleman from the square who owns a business down there, a restaurant that's getting killed by construction on the other side of the square.

667
01:17:43,732 --> 01:17:44,913
[SPEAKER_15]: right up the street on the other side.

668
01:17:44,953 --> 01:17:50,456
[SPEAKER_15]: So two points of entrance to certain businesses are going to be blocked or hampered or impeded for a period of time.

669
01:17:50,516 --> 01:17:54,558
[SPEAKER_15]: Now I know you're only going to be out there for one or two weeks tops, as you said, on High Street.

670
01:17:54,878 --> 01:18:00,061
[SPEAKER_15]: And then if any residual effects happen, I'm assuming that the rest of the repair work would go up Hillsdale Road if it's damaged?

671
01:18:00,081 --> 01:18:00,221
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

672
01:18:00,821 --> 01:18:01,021
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

673
01:18:01,261 --> 01:18:03,302
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's not a major act, I don't think, it's a neighborhood.

674
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:08,542
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not something I'm so worried about right now, because you guys don't know what's underground over there.

675
01:18:08,562 --> 01:18:09,943
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't know if there is a problem over there.

676
01:18:10,263 --> 01:18:13,444
[SPEAKER_15]: But the concern that I do have is with flow and with the trench repair work.

677
01:18:13,525 --> 01:18:16,706
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm not going to give the same 25-minute thing that I just did at the last one.

678
01:18:17,367 --> 01:18:21,889
[SPEAKER_15]: But ultimately, you know, we have a problem in the community with the way that our trenches are managed and our trenches are overseen.

679
01:18:22,429 --> 01:18:24,510
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't think we're doing a very good job at it.

680
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:26,491
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to do a better job at it.

681
01:18:26,611 --> 01:18:29,193
[SPEAKER_15]: So in order for me to be comfortable with this, I need some insurances.

682
01:18:30,456 --> 01:18:40,543
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I can say that I'm familiar with the process, and I don't know if you're familiar with this process, but we have an inspection process, and I don't know if we've done a whole lot of work in the city over the past couple years.

683
01:18:40,943 --> 01:18:48,648
[SPEAKER_17]: This is the first hearing that I've been to in Medford, so the person who had the town before had since retired, so I don't know what work took place before then.

684
01:18:48,868 --> 01:18:49,209
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry?

685
01:18:49,229 --> 01:18:50,410
[SPEAKER_17]: Did he retire because of us?

686
01:18:50,770 --> 01:18:50,850
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

687
01:18:52,731 --> 01:19:03,422
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe it was back in the 90s, somewhere along the 90s, the Department of Telecommunications and Energy came out with something called DTE 9822, which is an inspection process.

688
01:19:04,223 --> 01:19:12,872
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have our project coordinators who are assigned to this job go out and inspect the jobs 30, 60, and I believe it's either 90 or one year.

689
01:19:13,293 --> 01:19:15,175
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's a report that goes to the state every year.

690
01:19:16,293 --> 01:19:22,077
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's a task that when we do new trenches that our project coordinators are tasked with doing.

691
01:19:22,577 --> 01:19:31,243
[SPEAKER_17]: Again, I don't know if there's been a whole lot of trenching in Medford, so I can't, you know, really speak to that, but that is one of our processes, and we can, you know, it would be certainly part of this.

692
01:19:31,263 --> 01:19:34,826
[SPEAKER_17]: There's been plenty, but not the concrete amount of trenching in Medford.

693
01:19:35,587 --> 01:19:36,307
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

694
01:19:36,327 --> 01:19:37,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Good, Chair.

695
01:19:37,668 --> 01:19:38,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

696
01:19:41,295 --> 01:19:50,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I think since you need a permit from the MWRA, I'm just throwing it out there that we table it and get a response back from Comcast for our next meeting of whether or not you'll do curb-to-curb.

697
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:52,219
[SPEAKER_05]: I just have an issue.

698
01:19:52,259 --> 01:19:56,640
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I said in the last petition that I just don't want the trenches to keep sinking.

699
01:19:56,720 --> 01:20:05,763
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, you know, not right for a contractor to leave a piece of property like that, a street or a sidewalk, you know, sinking.

700
01:20:06,504 --> 01:20:09,425
[SPEAKER_05]: But I have a problem with requiring curb-to-curb in the last one.

701
01:20:10,782 --> 01:20:32,192
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of swaying from that here, so I would like, I'm not, I think it should be, if we're gonna, we need to have a meeting, probably a committee of the whole meeting, and get some answers from you of whether you do the curb to curb, because that's a main thoroughfare, we definitely don't want any sinkage on High Street, and if we're gonna mandate some curb to curb, I think we need to figure out some consistency in how we're gonna do that.

702
01:20:32,592 --> 01:20:39,696
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the business needs, wants Comcast, we fought loud and clear years and years ago that there'd be competition, so I,

703
01:20:40,310 --> 01:20:50,868
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't feel that the business should have it, but we just need to figure out amongst ourselves some way to keep this consistent and uniform and figure out how to do that prior to probably our next meeting.

704
01:20:52,358 --> 01:20:53,059
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. President, if I could.

705
01:20:53,479 --> 01:20:54,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

706
01:20:55,021 --> 01:21:03,288
[SPEAKER_27]: Typically what happens is it's the city engineer that requires, when they meet with the city engineer, whether it's going to be curb to curb or not.

707
01:21:04,189 --> 01:21:08,233
[SPEAKER_27]: So I think we should leave that up to the druthers of the city engineer.

708
01:21:08,633 --> 01:21:12,677
[SPEAKER_27]: On this particular case, as I mentioned, this particular business has a hardship.

709
01:21:13,377 --> 01:21:16,040
[SPEAKER_27]: And they need this Comcast to run their business.

710
01:21:16,821 --> 01:21:19,744
[SPEAKER_27]: And, you know, I don't feel comfortable waiting three weeks.

711
01:21:20,164 --> 01:21:25,770
[SPEAKER_27]: It happens on the last petitioner that there was someone in the room that had the authority to grant the curb-to-curb.

712
01:21:26,111 --> 01:21:28,273
[SPEAKER_27]: This gentleman clearly does not have that authority.

713
01:21:28,993 --> 01:21:38,339
[SPEAKER_27]: And because of the hardship of that particular business that's going into 92 High Street, I don't feel comfortable, Mr. President, leaving this for another three weeks.

714
01:21:38,379 --> 01:21:39,719
[SPEAKER_27]: So I will support this tonight.

715
01:21:40,240 --> 01:21:52,447
[SPEAKER_27]: And moving forward, I think some of our questions should be directed to our own city engineer and our own inspectional services on why work is not being put back in the manner that we see fit.

716
01:21:53,227 --> 01:21:56,529
[SPEAKER_27]: So I will support this petition tonight based on that, Mr. President.

717
01:21:58,328 --> 01:22:18,827
[SPEAKER_05]: through the chair I know you said you wouldn't be able to start until sometime after Labor Day anyway so I think that would only be almost a week postponement if we take this up with some answers from Comcast on September 19th and I think we need to again we just need to be consistent so I would ask my colleagues how they feel about tabling it for three weeks

718
01:22:20,203 --> 01:22:24,366
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm ready to vote on it in approval, Mr. President.

719
01:22:25,587 --> 01:22:30,331
[SPEAKER_19]: Money that Comcast gets out of me every month, I'm sure they'll be able to

720
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:39,854
[SPEAKER_19]: Pape High Street from Arlington to Malden with no sweat.

721
01:22:40,434 --> 01:22:41,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to table.

722
01:22:41,214 --> 01:22:43,396
[SPEAKER_26]: We have a motion by Councilor Knight to table.

723
01:22:43,436 --> 01:22:44,436
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we have a second?

724
01:22:44,596 --> 01:22:45,557
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm the second.

725
01:22:46,177 --> 01:22:49,899
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion by Councilor Longo to table it.

726
01:22:50,459 --> 01:22:51,920
[SPEAKER_26]: Seconded by Councilor Knight.

727
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:52,600
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

728
01:22:52,620 --> 01:22:53,641
[SPEAKER_26]: Roll call vote, Mr. President.

729
01:22:53,661 --> 01:22:55,222
[SPEAKER_26]: Roll call vote has been requested.

730
01:22:58,020 --> 01:22:59,120
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

731
01:22:59,261 --> 01:23:00,141
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor De La Russa?

732
01:23:00,201 --> 01:23:00,701
[SPEAKER_22]: Negative.

733
01:23:01,221 --> 01:23:01,902
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Falco?

734
01:23:01,962 --> 01:23:02,242
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

735
01:23:02,842 --> 01:23:03,402
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight?

736
01:23:03,702 --> 01:23:03,922
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

737
01:23:04,823 --> 01:23:05,523
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Kern?

738
01:23:05,563 --> 01:23:05,803
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

739
01:23:06,524 --> 01:23:07,284
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Marks?

740
01:23:07,424 --> 01:23:07,664
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

741
01:23:08,244 --> 01:23:09,025
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli?

742
01:23:09,065 --> 01:23:09,305
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

743
01:23:10,365 --> 01:23:11,045
[SPEAKER_22]: President Caprio?

744
01:23:11,085 --> 01:23:11,265
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

745
01:23:12,786 --> 01:23:14,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Four in the affirmative.

746
01:23:15,947 --> 01:23:17,108
[SPEAKER_26]: There's four to three at the table.

747
01:23:19,087 --> 01:23:23,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you get us that, do you mind, through the chair, get us that answer of whether or not you could do curb to curb?

748
01:23:23,550 --> 01:23:23,971
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry?

749
01:23:24,531 --> 01:23:27,554
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could get us those answers before the next meeting.

750
01:23:27,714 --> 01:23:27,914
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

751
01:23:28,014 --> 01:23:28,294
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

752
01:23:28,554 --> 01:23:29,615
[SPEAKER_18]: When will that next meeting be?

753
01:23:29,635 --> 01:23:30,336
[SPEAKER_18]: September 19th.

754
01:23:30,356 --> 01:23:30,956
[SPEAKER_18]: September 19th.

755
01:23:31,477 --> 01:23:32,037
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

756
01:23:34,579 --> 01:23:37,441
[SPEAKER_26]: Where are we going to meet September 19th?

757
01:23:37,581 --> 01:23:43,086
[SPEAKER_26]: That'll be determined this week and once we have the construction schedule.

758
01:23:43,106 --> 01:23:45,027
[SPEAKER_26]: 17594, that's the location.

759
01:23:46,792 --> 01:23:52,594
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. President, motion to waive the reading and have the petitioner give a brief synopsis of the application.

760
01:23:52,914 --> 01:23:53,715
[SPEAKER_25]: Do we have someone here?

761
01:23:55,655 --> 01:23:59,257
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address of the record, please.

762
01:24:00,717 --> 01:24:03,078
[SPEAKER_26]: Matthew Carmody from National Garden, 170 Medford Street.

763
01:24:03,378 --> 01:24:04,899
[SPEAKER_26]: And you are speaking in favor of this?

764
01:24:05,119 --> 01:24:05,339
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

765
01:24:05,859 --> 01:24:08,380
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we have anyone else speaking in favor of this project?

766
01:24:09,721 --> 01:24:12,162
[SPEAKER_26]: Hearing and seeing none, I close that part of the hearing.

767
01:24:12,682 --> 01:24:15,483
[SPEAKER_26]: Do we have anyone here that is speaking against this?

768
01:24:17,846 --> 01:24:21,270
[SPEAKER_26]: Hearing and seeing none, I close that portion of the hearing.

769
01:24:21,750 --> 01:24:22,551
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

770
01:24:23,011 --> 01:24:27,776
[SPEAKER_36]: This petition is installing a traffic control box to operate and monitor our existing gas regulation station.

771
01:24:28,097 --> 01:24:38,427
[SPEAKER_36]: This is replacing outdated equipment to make sure we can monitor for safety and reliability purposes and communicate to our pit itself to monitor the gas system throughout the year.

772
01:24:39,348 --> 01:24:39,589
[SPEAKER_36]: Thank you.

773
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:41,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco.

774
01:24:41,629 --> 01:24:42,370
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

775
01:24:42,390 --> 01:24:50,920
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could just tell us a little bit about the project, how long it's going to take, the hours you're going to be working, how many sidewalk panels you're going to be pulling out.

776
01:24:51,730 --> 01:24:53,951
[SPEAKER_36]: Some of the sidewalk panels were already excavated.

777
01:24:54,371 --> 01:25:16,840
[SPEAKER_36]: They're in temporary asphalt at the moment from our previous project on Wyman at Woburn So about six to seven asphalt concrete patches should take a few days regular work hours This has been pre-construction job walk has been performed with the engineering So it's generally to take three to four days I'd say at most and all panels will be fully put in 88 compliancy and make sure it's reviewed afterwards with the city engineering department

778
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Will they be replaced with concrete?

779
01:25:18,822 --> 01:25:19,022
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

780
01:25:19,282 --> 01:25:22,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the ones that are temporarily been replaced with asphalt?

781
01:25:22,445 --> 01:25:27,430
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes, so we temporarily pair them so our concrete subcontractor come in and make sure it's AD compliant, stamped, and so forth.

782
01:25:27,710 --> 01:25:30,853
[SPEAKER_36]: It's also in asphalt because we knew this work would be oncoming.

783
01:25:31,154 --> 01:25:34,096
[SPEAKER_36]: So it's only for about two to three weeks that they certainly have been in asphalt.

784
01:25:34,417 --> 01:25:39,582
[SPEAKER_36]: So as soon as this work is performed, our subcontractor will come in, perform the restoration with concrete.

785
01:25:40,663 --> 01:25:43,746
[SPEAKER_02]: This is sidewalk work, so you don't anticipate any road closures?

786
01:25:43,766 --> 01:25:45,387
[SPEAKER_36]: There shouldn't be any road closures.

787
01:25:45,468 --> 01:25:47,389
[SPEAKER_36]: If there is, it would be for one day max.

788
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:48,951
[SPEAKER_36]: If so, it would be communicated with the city.

789
01:25:49,572 --> 01:25:51,774
[SPEAKER_36]: This work will be fully communicated with the neighborhood.

790
01:25:52,114 --> 01:25:55,337
[SPEAKER_36]: My cell phone number is on a letter that's hand-delivered to every resident.

791
01:25:55,377 --> 01:25:58,400
[SPEAKER_36]: That's a butter that was given in the petition.

792
01:25:58,781 --> 01:26:03,245
[SPEAKER_36]: Also, we do mail out three separate letters, one with two YouTube videos.

793
01:26:03,505 --> 01:26:08,569
[SPEAKER_36]: to explain exactly what to expect during our work, also frequently ask questions and so forth.

794
01:26:08,609 --> 01:26:16,335
[SPEAKER_36]: But again, we do hand deliver every single letter with my cell phone number to personally contact me to make sure no one's inconvenienced and we work with them hand in hand.

795
01:26:16,595 --> 01:26:16,895
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

796
01:26:17,055 --> 01:26:26,903
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's key that you actually have included your cell phone number because it's always good that we have a point of contact and that the residents have a point of contact and especially to

797
01:26:27,423 --> 01:26:36,991
[SPEAKER_02]: No, like you said, to supply a YouTube video, which I don't think you hear that too often, but it's always nice that the residents can actually see what's going on or, you know, get more information as to what's going on in front of their homes.

798
01:26:37,031 --> 01:26:38,532
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you very much.

799
01:26:38,552 --> 01:26:39,333
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight.

800
01:26:40,033 --> 01:26:41,214
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

801
01:26:41,274 --> 01:26:42,896
[SPEAKER_15]: And Mr. Camardi, thank you for being here again.

802
01:26:42,956 --> 01:26:44,037
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we're all familiar with Matthew.

803
01:26:44,057 --> 01:26:45,698
[SPEAKER_15]: He's been here a number of times before.

804
01:26:45,718 --> 01:26:46,619
[SPEAKER_15]: I request a permit.

805
01:26:47,239 --> 01:26:48,981
[SPEAKER_15]: This particular permit, I have no problem with.

806
01:26:49,141 --> 01:26:53,845
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll certainly support it this evening, and I look forward to the next permit to come back for some street trench works.

807
01:26:53,865 --> 01:26:56,407
[SPEAKER_36]: We can talk about curb-to-curb paving on one of those jobs.

808
01:26:56,927 --> 01:26:57,968
[SPEAKER_36]: It seems to be a hot subject.

809
01:26:58,008 --> 01:26:59,830
[SPEAKER_36]: Thankfully, I'm in the sidewalk this time.

810
01:27:01,212 --> 01:27:01,732
[SPEAKER_36]: On the motion.

811
01:27:03,334 --> 01:27:04,515
[SPEAKER_20]: Move approval, Mr. President.

812
01:27:04,535 --> 01:27:05,076
[SPEAKER_26]: Second, Mr. President.

813
01:27:05,096 --> 01:27:08,880
[SPEAKER_26]: Approved by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Layton.

814
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:09,881
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

815
01:27:10,161 --> 01:27:10,361
[SPEAKER_19]: Aye.

816
01:27:10,682 --> 01:27:11,422
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

817
01:27:12,564 --> 01:27:12,904
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

818
01:27:13,525 --> 01:27:14,165
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

819
01:27:16,748 --> 01:27:19,311
[SPEAKER_26]: At this point, I relinquish the chair to Vice President Marks.

820
01:27:22,725 --> 01:27:24,346
[SPEAKER_27]: motions, orders, and resolutions.

821
01:27:25,047 --> 01:27:29,811
[SPEAKER_27]: Paper 17-610 offered by President Richard F. Caraviello.

822
01:27:30,532 --> 01:27:36,217
[SPEAKER_26]: I respectfully request and recommend that your Honorable... Mr. Chairman, I request that this paper be withdrawn.

823
01:27:36,237 --> 01:27:40,240

921
01:34:39,258 --> 01:34:54,230
[SPEAKER_15]: It's somewhat unrelated to the topic that you brought up, but we've had a number of resolutions that have gone forward from this council concerning Brooks Park and some illicit and what we call unsavory behavior going on down there behind the new apartment buildings and so on.

922
01:34:55,010 --> 01:35:00,632
[SPEAKER_15]: The council's passed a number of resolutions and I might follow it up a little bit, but I'd like to hear from you as to what impact you've seen.

923
01:35:00,672 --> 01:35:04,773
[SPEAKER_15]: Have you seen an improvement down there in the illicit activity that's going on in Brooks Park?

924
01:35:04,813 --> 01:35:05,573
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.

925
01:35:06,993 --> 01:35:10,274
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, something's got to be done with the, around that park.

926
01:35:10,774 --> 01:35:12,375
[SPEAKER_04]: Put up curbing or something.

927
01:35:12,395 --> 01:35:16,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Put up signs, because a lot of the people, they've been parking there for years.

928
01:35:16,916 --> 01:35:17,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Put it up and, you know.

929
01:35:18,397 --> 01:35:21,557

[SPEAKER_04]: I really don't see much of that.

932
01:35:27,062 --> 01:35:32,168
[SPEAKER_04]: There were people down in that parking lot that were talking about dealing drugs.

933
01:35:32,288 --> 01:35:37,914
[SPEAKER_15]: I heard they were ordering pizzas to their cars.

934
01:35:38,575 --> 01:35:39,656
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't seen that lately.

935
01:35:39,736 --> 01:35:42,880

01:37:43,946 --> 01:37:46,447
[SPEAKER_21]: She says, okay, it'll cost you $25 to appeal the ticket.

966
01:37:46,747 --> 01:37:47,707
[SPEAKER_21]: So I give her $25 in cash.

967
01:37:49,395 --> 01:37:50,416
[SPEAKER_21]: I got an application.

968
01:37:50,896 --> 01:37:51,836
[SPEAKER_21]: They filled it all out.

969
01:37:52,697 --> 01:37:53,877
[SPEAKER_21]: I haven't heard anything from it.

970
01:37:54,698 --> 01:37:56,339
[SPEAKER_21]: But three weeks later, I got a notice.

971
01:37:57,099 --> 01:38:00,621
[SPEAKER_21]: You read, I pay within seven days or we suspend your license or your registration.

972
01:38:01,262 --> 01:38:01,962
[SPEAKER_21]: So I went back.

973
01:38:02,622 --> 01:38:08,025
[SPEAKER_21]: I said to the lady there, can I have my $25 back if I pay for tickets?

974
01:38:08,105 --> 01:38:08,726
[SPEAKER_21]: She says, no.

975
01:38:09,906 --> 01:38:14,049
[SPEAKER_21]: I said, you mean to tell me you took $25 from me for an appeal?

976
01:38:15,446 --> 01:38:18,352
[SPEAKER_21]: And now, you're not giving me a piano, you're giving me my money back.

977
01:38:18,712 --> 01:38:19,213
[SPEAKER_21]: She says, no.

978
01:38:19,654 --> 01:38:22,259
[SPEAKER_21]: She says, unless you pay this, we're going to suspend your license.

979
01:38:22,339 --> 01:38:24,002
[SPEAKER_21]: I said, where's your manager?

980
01:38:24,443 --> 01:38:25,565
[SPEAKER_21]: So she gave me her phone number.

981
01:38:25,886 --> 01:38:26,848
[SPEAKER_21]: I called her for a week.

982
01:38:27,309 --> 01:38:27,589
[SPEAKER_21]: Nothing.

983
01:38:28,776 --> 01:38:32,238
[SPEAKER_21]: So I finally, you know, I said to myself, forget, give up.

984
01:38:32,278 --> 01:38:37,701
[SPEAKER_21]: And then my friend there, a gentleman, we happened to have coffee, so he happened to mention about this.

985
01:38:38,521 --> 01:38:39,121
[SPEAKER_21]: And there I am.

986
01:38:40,342 --> 01:38:43,784
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I work in Medford a lot, quite a bit.

987
01:38:44,424 --> 01:38:45,945
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's very, very difficult.

988
01:38:45,985 --> 01:38:51,048
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a commercial vehicle that I do a service call, which is like five minutes, 10 minutes.

989
01:38:51,768 --> 01:38:53,089
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, I had pictures.

990
01:38:53,529 --> 01:38:55,270
[SPEAKER_21]: I showed this gentleman at the,

991
01:38:56,825 --> 01:39:01,326
[SPEAKER_21]: what they call the parking place there, where it says, 30 minutes free parking.

992
01:39:01,846 --> 01:39:02,766
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know what that means.

993
01:39:03,087 --> 01:39:05,747
[SPEAKER_21]: Because then I got smart.

994
01:39:05,927 --> 01:39:11,709
[SPEAKER_21]: So I parked my car in my friend's parking lot, you know, in the rear there on Salem Street.

995
01:39:12,189 --> 01:39:21,231
[SPEAKER_21]: And I sat at Dunkin' Donuts and watched a guy, a lady, a poor little lady with a cane, from her car,

996
01:39:22,383 --> 01:39:23,764
[SPEAKER_21]: to the chaos machine.

997
01:39:24,685 --> 01:39:28,767
[SPEAKER_21]: He bought a ticket before he had the chance to put the money into the chaos machine.

998
01:39:29,428 --> 01:39:30,268
[SPEAKER_21]: That's disgusting.

999
01:39:31,189 --> 01:39:33,490
[SPEAKER_21]: Somebody should do something about it.

1000
01:39:33,851 --> 01:39:34,271
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1001
01:39:34,551 --> 01:39:35,351
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate it.

1002
01:39:35,772 --> 01:39:36,772
[SPEAKER_21]: Have a good night.

1003
01:39:37,933 --> 01:39:42,236
[SPEAKER_26]: I was just wondering if you had the dates as to when these tickets were issued.

1004
01:39:47,968 --> 01:40:06,606
[SPEAKER_21]: couple of months ago I I mean I can get you a date on the next meeting I have all the paperwork show me an email I'd like to be interested in like I said I in fact it was a surprise okay I can take a look at those I'd appreciate thank you thank you Scott Billy oh don't go away don't go away

1005
01:40:09,642 --> 01:40:16,184
[SPEAKER_14]: I should have never left metro.

1006
01:40:16,584 --> 01:40:33,607
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think that a lot of us have received some phone calls with these simple issues that are very big, and I think that this council has asked for meetings and we've had meetings with the republic pocket or have they changed their names again?

1007
01:40:33,627 --> 01:40:34,127
[SPEAKER_14]: So good.

1008
01:40:34,147 --> 01:40:34,747
[SPEAKER_14]: So the issues.

1009
01:40:38,247 --> 01:40:51,522
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate you coming up and talking about it because we've had a lot of concerns with, you know, I've had a person call that they got a ticket of 201 for blocking the sidewalk as they parked in the driveway.

1010
01:40:52,003 --> 01:40:52,984
[SPEAKER_14]: It's something that simple.

1011
01:40:53,064 --> 01:40:57,550
[SPEAKER_14]: So the understanding that our residents don't know what

1012
01:40:58,557 --> 01:41:12,342
[SPEAKER_14]: what's going on and when it's going on is very important that we meet again and really start pounding and putting some, you saw what had just happened when this council works together and putting restrictions and things happen.

1013
01:41:12,382 --> 01:41:15,783
[SPEAKER_14]: So I appreciate you coming out and sharing that because I think we need to do the same.

1014
01:41:15,863 --> 01:41:16,744
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you very much.

1015
01:41:16,884 --> 01:41:21,705
[SPEAKER_05]: On that same point, Councilor Schapiro is right.

1016
01:41:21,745 --> 01:41:26,127
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it was probably four months back where we were inundated with complaints.

1017
01:41:26,573 --> 01:41:32,417
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did sit down with Republic Park, and maybe this was around the same time that you were getting the tickets, about four or five months ago.

1018
01:41:32,437 --> 01:41:37,561
[SPEAKER_05]: And they had a whole new changeover in staff that wasn't trained properly.

1019
01:41:37,681 --> 01:41:42,765
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did meet with the head of the company that's in charge of this area, and he did reassure us.

1020
01:41:42,885 --> 01:41:46,308
[SPEAKER_05]: And we cracked the whip, and we asked the mayor to do the same.

1021
01:41:46,688 --> 01:41:52,172
[SPEAKER_05]: And since then, the complaints that I've received have slowed down tremendously.

1022
01:41:52,292 --> 01:41:55,755
[SPEAKER_05]: But there was a time frame, a couple months span, where we were getting

1023
01:41:56,630 --> 01:42:00,917
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, a couple complaints a day, it seemed like, and it was just that the traffic was not trained properly, which.

1024
01:42:01,387 --> 01:42:03,868
[SPEAKER_05]: they need to get a handle on if they have another turnover.

1025
01:42:04,528 --> 01:42:07,050
[SPEAKER_05]: So, just letting you know, we did meet with the company.

1026
01:42:07,390 --> 01:42:25,498
[SPEAKER_21]: The only comments I have about this is if the machine is broken, two machines are broken, and you have a picture of them, because these iPhones, the best thing in the world, and you go up to someone in the office, should say, okay, where did it happen?

1027
01:42:26,119 --> 01:42:26,759
[SPEAKER_21]: What happened?

1028
01:42:27,039 --> 01:42:28,500
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to send someone to fix it.

1029
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:35,585
[SPEAKER_21]: But when you walk into that office two or three times, I have nothing to do with this.

1030
01:42:36,185 --> 01:42:39,087
[SPEAKER_21]: Why are you here if you have nothing to do with this?

1031
01:42:39,107 --> 01:42:40,348
[SPEAKER_21]: See the city councilor.

1032
01:42:40,388 --> 01:42:40,989
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why I'm here.

1033
01:42:41,309 --> 01:42:42,149
[SPEAKER_21]: See the mayor.

1034
01:42:42,249 --> 01:42:44,751
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, the mayor is busy.

1035
01:42:45,512 --> 01:42:46,673
[SPEAKER_21]: She has a lot to do.

1036
01:42:47,193 --> 01:42:48,374
[SPEAKER_21]: City councilor is busy.

1037
01:42:48,854 --> 01:42:52,077
[SPEAKER_21]: Someone should be in that office that can answer these questions.

1038
01:42:52,117 --> 01:42:52,977
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll go after it now.

1039
01:42:53,458 --> 01:42:54,699
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. President?

1040
01:42:55,818 --> 01:42:56,539
[SPEAKER_27]: Vice President Mox.

1041
01:42:57,300 --> 01:42:58,702
[SPEAKER_27]: Just a quick question so I understand.

1042
01:42:59,263 --> 01:43:02,147
[SPEAKER_27]: You paid the $25 to have a hearing.

1043
01:43:02,467 --> 01:43:02,667
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

1044
01:43:02,727 --> 01:43:06,232
[SPEAKER_27]: Then you decided to pay the tickets and you didn't want the hearing.

1045
01:43:06,733 --> 01:43:07,233
[SPEAKER_21]: No, no, no.

1046
01:43:07,694 --> 01:43:08,155
[SPEAKER_21]: That's wrong.

1047
01:43:08,715 --> 01:43:09,596
[SPEAKER_21]: He was denied.

1048
01:43:09,697 --> 01:43:11,339
[SPEAKER_21]: I was not denied.

1049
01:43:11,439 --> 01:43:12,240
[SPEAKER_21]: I was never.

1050
01:43:13,281 --> 01:43:23,977
[SPEAKER_21]: never notified, but my next notification was if I don't pay $45 within seven days, I would have my license pulled away and my registration pulled away.

1051
01:43:24,017 --> 01:43:25,359
[SPEAKER_21]: But you never had a hearing.

1052
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:26,962
[SPEAKER_21]: And they never gave me the money back.

1053
01:43:29,692 --> 01:43:36,295
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. President, we should also request, Mr. President, that this gentleman get his money back, first of all.

1054
01:43:36,836 --> 01:43:38,937
[SPEAKER_27]: The $25 is for a hearing, if he never had a hearing.

1055
01:43:38,977 --> 01:43:41,718
[SPEAKER_26]: If you can get me the information, I would be happy to.

1056
01:43:41,738 --> 01:43:41,958
[SPEAKER_26]: I will.

1057
01:43:42,058 --> 01:43:43,379
[SPEAKER_26]: It's my counsel's will.

1058
01:43:43,519 --> 01:43:44,519
[SPEAKER_27]: I will, absolutely.

1059
01:43:44,539 --> 01:43:46,420
[SPEAKER_26]: If you give it to Ray, Ray will give it to me.

1060
01:43:46,621 --> 01:43:47,701
[SPEAKER_27]: I will, I will.

1061
01:43:47,941 --> 01:43:51,043
[SPEAKER_27]: It's my understanding, Mr. President, when these kiosks are not working,

1062
01:43:51,723 --> 01:43:56,704
[SPEAKER_27]: that they get an electronic message to their main office.

1063
01:43:57,264 --> 01:43:59,065
[SPEAKER_27]: So they know when these machines aren't working.

1064
01:43:59,585 --> 01:44:02,866
[SPEAKER_27]: So it's not even a matter of them going out or having a resident say they're not working.

1065
01:44:03,166 --> 01:44:15,109
[SPEAKER_27]: They know when they're malfunctioning and they should be out there immediately servicing these machines so residents don't have to walk 30, 40, 50 yards to get another kiosk, which is unacceptable in my opinion.

1066
01:44:15,669 --> 01:44:18,232
[SPEAKER_27]: So, if we can make that part of the report, too, Mr. President.

1067
01:44:18,732 --> 01:44:23,597
[SPEAKER_27]: What is the turnaround once they get notified of a kiosk that's malfunctioning?

1068
01:44:24,538 --> 01:44:26,860
[SPEAKER_25]: And please give that to Ray and let Ray give it to me.

1069
01:44:26,920 --> 01:44:29,743
[SPEAKER_25]: I appreciate it.

1070
01:44:29,803 --> 01:44:32,145
[SPEAKER_15]: It almost sounds like the gentleman received two tickets, right?

1071
01:44:32,185 --> 01:44:32,986
[SPEAKER_15]: You received one ticket.

1072
01:44:34,086 --> 01:44:35,107
[SPEAKER_15]: You received two tickets and you paid $25.

1073
01:44:35,147 --> 01:44:37,947
[SPEAKER_21]: The second one was almost on progress.

1074
01:44:38,188 --> 01:44:38,648
[SPEAKER_21]: The second one?

1075
01:44:38,668 --> 01:44:39,608
[SPEAKER_21]: I wanted to see what.

1076
01:44:39,948 --> 01:44:42,169
[SPEAKER_15]: So you came in there and you went and paid 25 bucks.

1077
01:44:42,229 --> 01:44:43,289
[SPEAKER_21]: I paid for both tickets.

1078
01:44:43,529 --> 01:44:44,349
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, you paid for both tickets.

1079
01:44:44,369 --> 01:44:45,310
[SPEAKER_15]: I paid for both tickets.

1080
01:44:45,330 --> 01:44:45,990
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, all right.

1081
01:44:46,330 --> 01:44:48,851
[SPEAKER_15]: It's sad because it almost sounded like you paid for one but not the other.

1082
01:44:48,931 --> 01:44:49,251
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, no.

1083
01:44:49,271 --> 01:44:51,452
[SPEAKER_15]: When you went in there, you appealed one and paid for one.

1084
01:44:51,592 --> 01:44:52,072
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

1085
01:44:52,152 --> 01:44:54,853
[SPEAKER_21]: Plus I paid $25 for the appeal and I got the money back.

1086
01:44:57,358 --> 01:44:57,678
[SPEAKER_26]: All set?

1087
01:44:58,138 --> 01:44:58,479
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1088
01:44:58,739 --> 01:44:59,079
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1089
01:44:59,099 --> 01:44:59,979
[SPEAKER_21]: Have a good night.

1090
01:45:00,019 --> 01:45:00,539
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1091
01:45:00,579 --> 01:45:01,480
[SPEAKER_24]: Good luck.

1092
01:45:01,520 --> 01:45:01,940
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you.

1093
01:45:02,120 --> 01:45:05,061
[SPEAKER_24]: Motion to receive and place on file, Mr. President.

1094
01:45:05,101 --> 01:45:08,403
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Scalpo has not completed his.

1095
01:45:08,423 --> 01:45:09,343
[SPEAKER_26]: He has one more thing to read.

1096
01:45:09,403 --> 01:45:10,804
[SPEAKER_26]: Real quick, real quick.

1097
01:45:12,084 --> 01:45:17,146
[SPEAKER_28]: Brianna, I'm going to blow your meeting out of the water that you had with the public.

1098
01:45:17,607 --> 01:45:22,909
[SPEAKER_28]: July 15th, a resident at Yale Street

1099
01:45:23,718 --> 01:45:30,360
[SPEAKER_28]: He purchased a vehicle, no he didn't purchase a vehicle, he changed his plates from one state to our state.

1100
01:45:31,740 --> 01:45:33,881
[SPEAKER_28]: Got his plates that day, put them on.

1101
01:45:34,941 --> 01:45:40,843
[SPEAKER_28]: At night, he got a ticket for an expired inspection sticker.

1102
01:45:41,323 --> 01:45:48,065
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, when you have new plates going on your vehicle, you have seven days to get your vehicle inspected.

1103
01:45:50,511 --> 01:46:02,577
[SPEAKER_28]: for what reason that they give these tickets out without knowing or I don't know if they have a program that they can reach into the registry to be able to see what the situation is.

1104
01:46:02,637 --> 01:46:13,782
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, they shouldn't be just going and giving a ticket for an inspection sticker unless they know for sure that there's a valid reason to give that inspection sticker, a ticket.

1105
01:46:15,061 --> 01:46:20,124
[SPEAKER_28]: So this is what happened is that he, like I say, he purchased new plates.

1106
01:46:21,525 --> 01:46:27,289
[SPEAKER_28]: That evening, that same evening, he got a ticket for an inspection that wasn't valid.

1107
01:46:27,790 --> 01:46:30,932
[SPEAKER_28]: And like I say, he has 10 days to get that sticker.

1108
01:46:31,492 --> 01:46:32,613
[SPEAKER_28]: So of course, that cost him.

1109
01:46:33,251 --> 01:46:36,212
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not even sure what the amount was.

1110
01:46:36,332 --> 01:46:36,212
$25.

1111
01:46:36,432 --> 01:46:37,452
[SPEAKER_28]: Did he appeal?

1112
01:46:37,472 --> 01:46:39,593
[SPEAKER_28]: Did he appeal the ticket?

1113
01:46:39,753 --> 01:46:41,833
[SPEAKER_28]: Because obviously it was issued in violation of law.

1114
01:46:41,853 --> 01:46:46,295
[SPEAKER_28]: He has appealed the ticket, but he hasn't gotten a hearing.

1115
01:46:47,875 --> 01:46:51,196
[SPEAKER_28]: My question is that if they're going to be tagging for inspection stickers,

1116
01:46:53,447 --> 01:47:01,389
[SPEAKER_28]: stuff like that, they should be able to be in their computer, that they should be able to get to the registry to see if they can actually do this.

1117
01:47:01,469 --> 01:47:13,432
[SPEAKER_26]: If you could get me a copy of that one also, along with that other gentleman's, it would be appreciated and we'll bring it to the attention of park managers.

1118
01:47:13,452 --> 01:47:14,252
[SPEAKER_26]: Do you have it with you?

1119
01:47:16,201 --> 01:47:17,162
[SPEAKER_26]: No, I'll have to get it to you.

1120
01:47:17,182 --> 01:47:18,643
[SPEAKER_26]: If you can get it and give it to me, I'd appreciate it.

1121
01:47:18,943 --> 01:47:24,388
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think maybe it's time that we schedule another hearing, a meeting with the parking benefit people.

1122
01:47:24,408 --> 01:47:25,149
[SPEAKER_28]: That's my closing.

1123
01:47:25,189 --> 01:47:36,398
[SPEAKER_28]: My closing, if you don't mind, I'm requesting that the council have a public meeting and to have a representative of public parking to discuss these inconsistencies.

1124
01:47:36,979 --> 01:47:40,502
[SPEAKER_28]: And I think that would be a good idea to get the citizens involved in this.

1125
01:47:41,142 --> 01:47:43,845
[SPEAKER_28]: And then you're really going to see how inconsistent this is.

1126
01:47:44,273 --> 01:47:54,488
[SPEAKER_26]: Well, we've had a public meeting with them before, and as Councilor Longo said, tickets slowed down dramatically and a lot of things did get corrected.

1127
01:47:55,429 --> 01:47:57,152
[SPEAKER_26]: I think that was about six months ago?

1128
01:47:57,432 --> 01:47:57,813
[SPEAKER_26]: Less than that.

1129
01:47:59,315 --> 01:48:01,297
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, so maybe it's time we have another hearing with them.

1130
01:48:01,317 --> 01:48:07,845
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, it is a public hearing, and we can bring some other things to the attention.

1131
01:48:08,706 --> 01:48:10,908
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, I think every meeting that we have is a public meeting.

1132
01:48:10,928 --> 01:48:14,412
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, every meeting that the council has when we convene is a public meeting.

1133
01:48:15,714 --> 01:48:18,196
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think also that it's important to point out that

1134
01:48:19,818 --> 01:48:35,279
[SPEAKER_15]: oversight and the implementation of the traffic regulations falls under the jurisdiction and purview of the Traffic Commission and Republic can come all they want, but if the Traffic Commission is not on board as the oversight agency, then we quit talking to the DEFI as we're talking to the wall.

1135
01:48:35,980 --> 01:48:37,482
[SPEAKER_15]: This is under the purview of the Traffic Commission.

1136
01:48:37,862 --> 01:48:39,603
[SPEAKER_15]: This is something the Traffic Commission establishes.

1137
01:48:39,664 --> 01:48:49,851
[SPEAKER_15]: They've contracted out with an entity for parking management purposes and the purposes of the contract is to enforce the existing parking ordinances that are constructed through the Traffic and Parking Commission.

1138
01:48:49,911 --> 01:48:53,514
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that if we're going to do anything that should be important that they're involved as well, Mr. President.

1139
01:48:53,534 --> 01:48:56,516
[SPEAKER_15]: And I can totally understand, however, you know, also

1140
01:48:57,637 --> 01:49:00,698
[SPEAKER_15]: looking at this thing on a citywide basis.

1141
01:49:00,718 --> 01:49:11,560
[SPEAKER_15]: There are inconsistencies, there's no question about it, but I think that we need to come up with a better solution than, you know, I have this ticket happen on this day at this place, this guy did this at this place.

1142
01:49:11,640 --> 01:49:19,922
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, that approach doesn't really bring us to a solution, Mr. President, and I think we need to come up with some solutions as to what it is that we need to do.

1143
01:49:20,442 --> 01:49:24,483
[SPEAKER_15]: And some of these things that are going on in the community have been what I would call

1144
01:49:25,203 --> 01:49:28,744
[SPEAKER_15]: laughable in moments, and you know what I mean, just wrong in others.

1145
01:49:29,225 --> 01:49:34,727
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've had good luck in speaking with Mr. Stackhouse and explaining the situations that are going on in the community.

1146
01:49:34,767 --> 01:49:49,492
[SPEAKER_15]: But part of the issue that I have, Mr. President, is that when we said let's bring parking into Medford, let's bring parking enforcement into Medford, that the focus was on freeing up spots in our central business districts to prevent people from other communities coming in here and taking up spots in our downtowns.

1147
01:49:50,072 --> 01:50:09,384
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's expanded upon that and I was a little bit more comfortable when the focus was on our business districts, not in our neighborhoods, not on streets that are dead ends, not on streets that have had families living on these streets for 30 and 40 years like Sylvia Road where they have individuals that have a system of how they park because they've all lived together and they're good neighbors and they know what's going on.

1148
01:50:09,444 --> 01:50:11,706
[SPEAKER_15]: So, they might block a driveway or they might park with two

1149
01:50:12,106 --> 01:50:14,589
[SPEAKER_15]: tires up on the curb so that cars can get by.

1150
01:50:14,609 --> 01:50:18,733
[SPEAKER_15]: Now the gentleman on Brookings Street, Brooks Parker, spoke about a commercial vehicle.

1151
01:50:18,773 --> 01:50:20,015
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the guy lives on Sylvia Road.

1152
01:50:20,135 --> 01:50:21,977
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, that vehicle is off of Sylvia Road.

1153
01:50:22,017 --> 01:50:22,978
[SPEAKER_15]: Why was it off Sylvia Road?

1154
01:50:22,998 --> 01:50:25,000
[SPEAKER_15]: Because the neighbors went to him and said, you can't park your car here.

1155
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:26,181
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a commercial plate.

1156
01:50:26,441 --> 01:50:27,543
[SPEAKER_15]: We can't get up and down the street.

1157
01:50:27,603 --> 01:50:28,544
[SPEAKER_15]: And they've policed themselves.

1158
01:50:28,604 --> 01:50:30,786
[SPEAKER_15]: And they've been able to do that successfully for a number of years.

1159
01:50:30,846 --> 01:50:32,568
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're coming into a situation now where

1160
01:50:32,848 --> 01:50:37,873
[SPEAKER_15]: I think Park Medford's focus is leaving the business districts and coming more towards the residential neighborhoods.

1161
01:50:37,913 --> 01:50:44,680
[SPEAKER_15]: And we need to really realign and refocus the direction that they're going in, because I don't think it's making the residents' quality of life any better.

1162
01:50:44,700 --> 01:50:49,104
[SPEAKER_15]: And I don't think that it's really meeting the objective and goal that was stated when it first came out.

1163
01:50:49,124 --> 01:50:53,448
[SPEAKER_15]: So I appreciate you taking the time to come up here, Mr. Scott, for all the work you put into doing it and investigating.

1164
01:50:54,069 --> 01:50:54,389
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1165
01:50:54,589 --> 01:50:54,850
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1166
01:51:00,816 --> 01:51:01,856
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address of the record, please.

1167
01:51:02,897 --> 01:51:04,898
[SPEAKER_07]: David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

1168
01:51:05,418 --> 01:51:09,279
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to touch base a little bit on this one situation.

1169
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:21,123
[SPEAKER_07]: I have traveled just about every business district in Medford, as well as a lot of the residents, and I think that this is, I actually agree with Adam Knight that this is a systemic problem.

1170
01:51:21,564 --> 01:51:24,665
[SPEAKER_07]: This is not a singular problem in specific areas of the city.

1171
01:51:25,545 --> 01:51:35,635
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I mean by systemic is that I really firmly believe that it's time to take republic and kind of put their feet to the coals at this point and decide what it is that we want to do with this program.

1172
01:51:38,738 --> 01:51:44,363
[SPEAKER_07]: It does not behoove the city to not have somebody that's working with this program that doesn't have a vested interest in the city.

1173
01:51:44,944 --> 01:51:46,005
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's what's happening.

1174
01:51:46,045 --> 01:51:55,376
[SPEAKER_07]: On a customer service level I think what we've done is unfortunately we've made a lot of people unhappy whether they're traveling from downtown to downtown or even some of the businesses.

1175
01:51:55,456 --> 01:51:59,801
[SPEAKER_07]: I beg to differ in one area in the respect of talking to the business owners.

1176
01:52:00,763 --> 01:52:03,486
[SPEAKER_07]: If you talk to a lot of the business owners a lot of them will blame their

1177
01:52:04,647 --> 01:52:06,648
[SPEAKER_07]: current business status on the parking.

1178
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:08,449
[SPEAKER_07]: And perceptions are realities.

1179
01:52:08,489 --> 01:52:12,631
[SPEAKER_07]: When someone's perception is that, you know, their business is down, that's their reality.

1180
01:52:12,851 --> 01:52:14,873
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we have to take that into consideration.

1181
01:52:15,873 --> 01:52:32,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Number two, what we've also done in creating this situation, again, going back to Adam's, Councilor Knight's point, is that we've actually forced, yes, there are extra parking spaces in the downtown, but we've forced those commuters into the neighborhoods, even further in, deeper in.

1182
01:52:32,922 --> 01:52:33,882
[SPEAKER_07]: So it really hasn't helped.

1183
01:52:33,962 --> 01:52:35,283
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually hurt tremendously.

1184
01:52:35,883 --> 01:52:53,968
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's either we put Republic on notice and let them know that this contract is not a contract that we're all excited about anymore, that we need to kind of put their feet to the fire and make something happen for the downtown communities, for the citizens, and allow them to be able to go in and out of their downtowns feeling good

1185
01:52:54,608 --> 01:52:56,189
[SPEAKER_07]: about what they want to accomplish.

1186
01:52:56,209 --> 01:53:00,172
[SPEAKER_07]: The kiosks, my personal opinion, do not work in downtowns.

1187
01:53:00,372 --> 01:53:01,133
[SPEAKER_07]: They just don't work.

1188
01:53:01,253 --> 01:53:04,875
[SPEAKER_07]: They're better in parking lots than the garages, but they're certainly not good on downtown streets.

1189
01:53:06,076 --> 01:53:08,657
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just my opinion, and I think it's time.

1190
01:53:08,797 --> 01:53:20,725
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually feel bad that the city council has to address all of these issues when it actually should be an in-house program for the city, created by the city, controlled by the city, not another outside entity.

1191
01:53:21,065 --> 01:53:21,366
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1192
01:53:25,743 --> 01:53:26,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address of the Director of Police.

1193
01:53:27,004 --> 01:53:27,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Good evening.

1194
01:53:28,025 --> 01:53:30,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, Medford, Mass.

1195
01:53:31,388 --> 01:53:37,674
[SPEAKER_08]: When Republic Parking first came in, I did a videotape to bring it to the attention of the public, and it never got on TV.

1196
01:53:39,075 --> 01:53:43,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Tonight, an elected official allegedly is parked in a fire lane, so I told Roy Belson,

1197
01:53:44,490 --> 01:53:51,414
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, if our elected officials are going to flagrantly violate the rules, why should the citizens pay for parking?

1198
01:53:52,074 --> 01:53:55,316
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a sin, it's a shame, and that individual should not be re-elected.

1199
01:53:55,897 --> 01:53:56,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1200
01:54:05,084 --> 01:54:06,605
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Falco, all in favor?

1201
01:54:06,625 --> 01:54:07,866
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

1202
01:54:07,906 --> 01:54:09,807
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

1203
01:54:10,327 --> 01:54:20,694
[SPEAKER_26]: 17606, petition for a sign denial reversal by Pastor Exeter Febrea for Evangelical Haitians Church of Somerville, 400 9th Street, Medford.

1204
01:54:21,374 --> 01:54:24,496
[SPEAKER_26]: OCD number 2017-4.

1205
01:54:24,556 --> 01:54:27,378
[SPEAKER_26]: Sign exceeds allowable space.

1206
01:54:27,418 --> 01:54:31,160
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't want that.

1207
01:54:32,041 --> 01:54:33,922
[SPEAKER_26]: Allowable space size.

1208
01:54:38,180 --> 01:54:51,808
[SPEAKER_24]: Is the petitioner here?

1209
01:54:52,028 --> 01:54:52,148
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1210
01:54:52,208 --> 01:54:53,249
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you.

1211
01:54:55,150 --> 01:54:56,071
[SPEAKER_29]: Good evening, everybody.

1212
01:54:58,672 --> 01:55:02,535
[SPEAKER_29]: Marie Wolverson, representing Pastor Fabian.

1213
01:55:02,595 --> 01:55:06,257
[SPEAKER_29]: He is not here and my colleague here, Mr. Ulrich German.

1214
01:55:08,884 --> 01:55:11,086
[SPEAKER_29]: I would like to first apologize.

1215
01:55:11,266 --> 01:55:34,906
[SPEAKER_29]: I believe that I was supposed to attend a meeting, the last meeting that you guys have, and I was overseas, and I came back and found a voicemail, and I wasn't even able to alert Pastor Fabio of the meeting because my phone was off, so I apologize if I have wasted anybody's time, but also

1216
01:55:36,498 --> 01:55:53,693
[SPEAKER_29]: I believe that you guys have met on the old denial sign as well, which I wasn't supposed to be on the table anymore, because I was told to sign.

1217
01:55:56,287 --> 01:56:10,397
[SPEAKER_29]: get started, start over on a new size, new pedestal, because the size of the sign was too big and the pedestal was too high the last time we met.

1218
01:56:11,514 --> 01:56:22,103
[SPEAKER_29]: So I went right back downstairs and talked to John Bavuzzo and we fill out a brand new application and started over.

1219
01:56:22,944 --> 01:56:25,766
[SPEAKER_29]: So I was waiting to hear from

1220
01:56:27,207 --> 01:56:32,710
[SPEAKER_29]: the city on either an approval or denial of that second application.

1221
01:56:32,830 --> 01:56:34,411
[SPEAKER_29]: So I haven't heard from any.

1222
01:56:34,551 --> 01:56:35,812
[SPEAKER_29]: I didn't hear from anyone.

1223
01:56:36,272 --> 01:56:38,993
[SPEAKER_29]: So we were just waiting to hear.

1224
01:56:39,153 --> 01:56:45,036
[SPEAKER_29]: So when I came back from vacation, I went back downstairs and find out, well, we had a denial the whole time.

1225
01:56:45,056 --> 01:56:47,938
[SPEAKER_29]: They just never told us, told the church about it.

1226
01:56:48,338 --> 01:56:49,499
[SPEAKER_29]: So that's the second.

1227
01:56:50,259 --> 01:56:54,962
[SPEAKER_29]: application that you guys have right now, the second denial that you guys have on the second size.

1228
01:56:55,483 --> 01:57:00,786
[SPEAKER_29]: As you can see, the pedestal of the new site is way down to the floor.

1229
01:57:01,286 --> 01:57:07,291
[SPEAKER_29]: It come from 3.6 inches to way down to one inch, and I believe that was one of the concern.

1230
01:57:07,751 --> 01:57:11,073
[SPEAKER_29]: The size went up, went down from 5 by 8 to 4 by 8.

1231
01:57:12,494 --> 01:57:13,694
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, if I can.

1232
01:57:14,075 --> 01:57:18,076
[SPEAKER_14]: The big issue was it was 11 feet, if you remember.

1233
01:57:18,196 --> 01:57:19,036
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't in inches.

1234
01:57:19,717 --> 01:57:24,599
[SPEAKER_14]: The sign was 5 by 8, which I think wasn't something that we had questioned about.

1235
01:57:24,619 --> 01:57:26,999
[SPEAKER_14]: The question we had that it rose to 11 feet.

1236
01:57:27,019 --> 01:57:29,620
[SPEAKER_14]: So now it's back down to the ground 5 by 8.

1237
01:57:29,721 --> 01:57:30,141
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1238
01:57:37,178 --> 01:57:39,460
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you have anything else to state?

1239
01:57:39,660 --> 01:57:40,061
[SPEAKER_29]: That's it.

1240
01:57:40,401 --> 01:57:41,582
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm sorry, was I talking too much?

1241
01:57:41,642 --> 01:57:42,843
[SPEAKER_29]: No, no, no.

1242
01:57:42,863 --> 01:57:45,405
[SPEAKER_29]: We're here to listen.

1243
01:57:45,565 --> 01:57:46,706
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, no, I'm done.

1244
01:57:46,766 --> 01:57:47,647
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

1245
01:57:47,667 --> 01:57:51,090
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much and thank you very much for your patience going through the process.

1246
01:57:51,150 --> 01:57:55,294
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it can be a confusing and daunting task sometimes to get involved in government when you're not familiar with it.

1247
01:57:56,975 --> 01:57:59,597
[SPEAKER_15]: Ultimately, the sign was 11 feet tall when it was brought forward.

1248
01:57:59,617 --> 01:58:06,381
[SPEAKER_15]: They had a rendering of a gentleman that said it was six feet tall next to the guy that was assigned to him way over his head, so we all had a number of concerns about that.

1249
01:58:06,401 --> 01:58:16,687
[SPEAKER_15]: It's at the location of the church right next to the Brooks School, so there was some concerns about sight lines and visibility and whether or not it was gonna impact pedestrians and cars driving up the street and so forth.

1250
01:58:17,327 --> 01:58:23,951
[SPEAKER_15]: I think in our discussions, we said that we're not really opposed to the sign being five by eight, but based upon the rendering that we have here,

1251
01:58:25,312 --> 01:58:28,414
[SPEAKER_15]: confirmation and some assurances that, you know what I mean, it's going to be a little different.

1252
01:58:28,434 --> 01:58:34,718
[SPEAKER_15]: So this is something that I've been waiting to hear at the council floor since you came in for your first application.

1253
01:58:34,998 --> 01:58:37,800
[SPEAKER_15]: We went through the subcommittee process and the subcommittee did a great job on it.

1254
01:58:37,820 --> 01:58:42,783
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, and I certainly don't have a problem supporting the sign this evening and I'll move for approval, Mr. President.

1255
01:58:43,343 --> 01:58:43,904
[SPEAKER_27]: I second that.

1256
01:58:44,124 --> 01:58:45,485
[SPEAKER_27]: Motion on the floor for approval?

1257
01:58:46,465 --> 01:58:46,745
[SPEAKER_27]: Second.

1258
01:58:46,965 --> 01:58:53,428
[SPEAKER_27]: By Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor, motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Knight.

1259
01:58:53,828 --> 01:58:57,009
[SPEAKER_27]: I just have one question, this is not internally illuminated?

1260
01:58:57,629 --> 01:58:58,870
[SPEAKER_27]: This is not illuminated, right?

1261
01:58:59,030 --> 01:59:00,190
[SPEAKER_27]: It is an illuminated sign.

1262
01:59:00,730 --> 01:59:02,371
[SPEAKER_27]: It is illuminated?

1263
01:59:02,391 --> 01:59:03,291
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, it always has been.

1264
01:59:04,432 --> 01:59:05,112
[SPEAKER_27]: I retract that.

1265
01:59:05,412 --> 01:59:11,574
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, I don't recall, I don't see it in the fonts, logos, right now.

1266
01:59:12,455 --> 01:59:13,675
[SPEAKER_27]: It doesn't state it in the.

1267
01:59:14,515 --> 01:59:15,876
[SPEAKER_29]: It is if you look in the application.

1268
01:59:16,748 --> 01:59:21,212
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay, because what you gave to us doesn't state that it's illuminated.

1269
01:59:23,374 --> 01:59:25,196
[SPEAKER_27]: The application doesn't come before us.

1270
01:59:25,516 --> 01:59:27,137
[SPEAKER_27]: PVC and internal lighting.

1271
01:59:27,898 --> 01:59:28,138
[SPEAKER_29]: Yep.

1272
01:59:32,382 --> 01:59:35,745
[SPEAKER_14]: The original didn't have that.

1273
01:59:36,126 --> 01:59:39,128
[SPEAKER_29]: Yep, the first one was and the second one is as well.

1274
01:59:41,118 --> 01:59:43,260
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not being denied because of lighting.

1275
01:59:43,840 --> 01:59:46,942
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it was it wasn't.

1276
01:59:47,223 --> 01:59:50,165
[SPEAKER_29]: It was always size and height was always high.

1277
01:59:50,505 --> 02:00:01,633
[SPEAKER_27]: But this council has been on record for many other previous signs, in particular freestanding signs against the woman age, especially hours of operation.

1278
02:00:01,653 --> 02:00:04,716
[SPEAKER_27]: I mean, is there a recommendation with elimination?

1279
02:00:04,756 --> 02:00:05,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Just a question.

1280
02:00:05,977 --> 02:00:07,578
[SPEAKER_05]: Also want to occur through the chair.

1281
02:00:08,639 --> 02:00:10,200
[SPEAKER_05]: When will the elimination take place?

1282
02:00:10,280 --> 02:00:10,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it

1283
02:00:11,360 --> 02:00:17,083
[SPEAKER_05]: 24, is it during the dark 24-7 or will it be shut off at 10 p.m.?

1284
02:00:17,223 --> 02:00:28,009
[SPEAKER_29]: No, just during daylight, just during, because we, pastor is going to be during church, during 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock in the morning.

1285
02:00:29,289 --> 02:00:39,997
[SPEAKER_29]: until 6 o'clock at night, we're off, we're done, because it's only for message during the day and during service hours, and then it's off again.

1286
02:00:40,157 --> 02:00:42,178
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's not going to be on at night at all.

1287
02:00:42,198 --> 02:00:43,639
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, so it will be in service.

1288
02:00:43,819 --> 02:00:44,520
[SPEAKER_29]: Absolutely.

1289
02:00:44,660 --> 02:00:45,881
[SPEAKER_29]: It's just message during service.

1290
02:00:45,901 --> 02:00:47,242
[SPEAKER_29]: What pastor wants to do

1291
02:00:47,862 --> 02:00:55,146
[SPEAKER_29]: It doesn't want, we want to kind of offer a message to the community during service hours and during day.

1292
02:00:55,506 --> 02:00:58,527
[SPEAKER_29]: We don't want this to be like just solely a Haitian church.

1293
02:00:58,587 --> 02:01:04,290
[SPEAKER_29]: We just want to have services, second service, an English service offering

1294
02:01:04,550 --> 02:01:05,890
[SPEAKER_29]: We don't want the community to come in.

1295
02:01:05,990 --> 02:01:13,193
[SPEAKER_29]: We just want to put a message out there that they can come in for services during service hours, during Sundays.

1296
02:01:14,233 --> 02:01:16,093
[SPEAKER_29]: We don't want this to be so behavioral.

1297
02:01:16,173 --> 02:01:16,514
[SPEAKER_29]: That's it.

1298
02:01:16,574 --> 02:01:20,015
[SPEAKER_29]: We do not want this to be all night because that's electricity.

1299
02:01:20,355 --> 02:01:22,876
[SPEAKER_29]: And if you know my pastor, it will not happen.

1300
02:01:23,056 --> 02:01:26,056
[SPEAKER_29]: It will not have that electricity going in at night.

1301
02:01:26,116 --> 02:01:27,137
[SPEAKER_29]: It's not going to happen.

1302
02:01:27,937 --> 02:01:29,338
[SPEAKER_29]: Councilor Dello Russo.

1303
02:01:29,398 --> 02:01:34,500
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Chairman, both chairman of this meeting and all of the side committee.

1304
02:01:36,001 --> 02:01:40,142
[SPEAKER_19]: I offer a motion of approval for this.

1305
02:01:41,463 --> 02:01:42,764
[SPEAKER_19]: Looks Cholera.

1306
02:01:43,344 --> 02:01:43,724
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1307
02:01:45,885 --> 02:01:51,988
[SPEAKER_27]: So if I could make the condition, a portion of the sign is for messaging.

1308
02:01:52,468 --> 02:01:52,808
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

1309
02:01:53,588 --> 02:01:57,170
[SPEAKER_27]: So so you anticipate to have what a rotation of

1310
02:01:58,019 --> 02:02:00,321
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, messaging is coming for Sunday service.

1311
02:02:00,341 --> 02:02:04,563
[SPEAKER_29]: This is a message that's going to, this is a message that's going to come in on Sunday.

1312
02:02:04,643 --> 02:02:09,046
[SPEAKER_29]: Please come in on Sunday for service at this hour, nine o'clock service.

1313
02:02:09,086 --> 02:02:10,267
[SPEAKER_29]: Sunday school starts.

1314
02:02:10,687 --> 02:02:14,390
[SPEAKER_29]: Just general message for people to come in on our Sunday school service.

1315
02:02:15,010 --> 02:02:21,595
[SPEAKER_27]: Are you aware of the current sign ordinance that regulates how often you can change a sign, the messaging on a sign?

1316
02:02:24,051 --> 02:02:36,757
[SPEAKER_29]: We don't, but my pastor is kind of not very technical savvy, so somebody is going to have to help him with that, so I'm pretty sure that, you know, one of us is going to have to help him, so that's probably not going to be.

1317
02:02:37,057 --> 02:02:37,938
[SPEAKER_29]: It's probably going to be.

1318
02:02:39,110 --> 02:02:43,054
[SPEAKER_29]: It's probably going to be on a rotation basis, whatever message that we put in.

1319
02:02:43,735 --> 02:02:45,476
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Councilor Wong-Tam.

1320
02:02:45,556 --> 02:02:47,919
[SPEAKER_05]: I think to clear it up, it's not going to be a scrolling message.

1321
02:02:47,939 --> 02:02:52,423
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be like one week it will say the X, the next week it will say something different.

1322
02:02:52,443 --> 02:02:54,125
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's going to be something every 10 seconds.

1323
02:02:54,505 --> 02:02:54,785
[SPEAKER_29]: No.

1324
02:02:55,286 --> 02:02:59,250
[SPEAKER_29]: It's basically just really kind of like the message of Sunday.

1325
02:02:59,790 --> 02:03:07,893
[SPEAKER_29]: Sunday school mostly like Sunday school date of events Mostly, I mean we had an event on in September.

1326
02:03:08,273 --> 02:03:15,936
[SPEAKER_29]: We haven't had an event again since September So basically there wouldn't be anything to announce again until like every Sunday Sunday school.

1327
02:03:16,356 --> 02:03:28,241
[SPEAKER_29]: This is the schedule for Sunday We have a service once on Sunday So if we do decide to go with the English language service, so it's gonna be 9 o'clock and 12 o'clock This is the two service that we have

1328
02:03:28,721 --> 02:03:30,722
[SPEAKER_29]: And this is the messages that's going to be happening.

1329
02:03:30,762 --> 02:03:32,962
[SPEAKER_29]: So that's probably what we're going to be announcing.

1330
02:03:33,002 --> 02:03:43,524
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's not going to be — it's not a business, so I don't see the need to have tons of messages every single day going on on this thing.

1331
02:03:43,845 --> 02:03:49,766
[SPEAKER_29]: So on the week that we have revivals, which we have three times a year, revivals.

1332
02:03:50,386 --> 02:03:58,111
[SPEAKER_29]: We probably will have a message say this is what the message is going to be tonight and tomorrow There's gonna be another message every night.

1333
02:03:58,211 --> 02:04:07,176
[SPEAKER_29]: There's a there's gonna be service for revival seven days So every day there's gonna be a message for what the message is going to be tomorrow for revival So that's that type of stuff.

1334
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:10,058
[SPEAKER_14]: So Council Scarpelli again, I think this is why

1335
02:04:10,878 --> 02:04:12,340
[SPEAKER_14]: having that subcommittee.

1336
02:04:12,580 --> 02:04:13,761
[SPEAKER_14]: That meeting is so important.

1337
02:04:14,783 --> 02:04:15,563
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm spinning right now.

1338
02:04:15,604 --> 02:04:17,165
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll be honest with you.

1339
02:04:17,426 --> 02:04:18,467
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm trying to gauge.

1340
02:04:19,588 --> 02:04:25,455
[SPEAKER_14]: So the conversation would have been understanding what the ordinance is so you understood.

1341
02:04:25,475 --> 02:04:28,318
[SPEAKER_14]: The more in-depth conversation would

1342
02:04:28,678 --> 02:04:32,002
[SPEAKER_14]: would have been the acceptance of the size of the sign.

1343
02:04:32,402 --> 02:04:34,664
[SPEAKER_14]: If it's illuminated, would we accept it?

1344
02:04:34,704 --> 02:04:35,525
[SPEAKER_14]: So I don't know.

1345
02:04:35,545 --> 02:04:43,353
[SPEAKER_14]: I look for guides from my senior colleague on this committee.

1346
02:04:43,673 --> 02:04:45,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Falco has a thought.

1347
02:04:47,965 --> 02:04:52,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the actual section that has the message piece?

1348
02:04:53,006 --> 02:04:56,267
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, so the top part is going to be the logo of the church.

1349
02:04:56,327 --> 02:04:58,547
[SPEAKER_29]: That's not going to be illuminated at all.

1350
02:04:58,647 --> 02:05:01,908
[SPEAKER_29]: That would cost the church way too much money.

1351
02:05:02,108 --> 02:05:04,228
[SPEAKER_29]: It's just literally down in the bottom.

1352
02:05:04,328 --> 02:05:05,488
[SPEAKER_29]: Just that revival piece.

1353
02:05:06,108 --> 02:05:07,049
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1354
02:05:07,529 --> 02:05:08,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just trying to look at the sketch here.

1355
02:05:09,209 --> 02:05:11,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that three feet?

1356
02:05:15,780 --> 02:05:17,726
[SPEAKER_02]: It says you have one here and then four.

1357
02:05:17,746 --> 02:05:19,050
[SPEAKER_29]: Is that three feet of?

1358
02:05:21,396 --> 02:05:23,077
[SPEAKER_02]: This here, is that?

1359
02:05:23,517 --> 02:05:25,398
[SPEAKER_27]: It's like probably two feet worth of.

1360
02:05:25,418 --> 02:05:26,018
[SPEAKER_27]: Is it two feet?

1361
02:05:26,058 --> 02:05:27,459
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, that's about like maybe.

1362
02:05:27,499 --> 02:05:28,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Three feet of messaging?

1363
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:29,060
[SPEAKER_29]: Two feet?

1364
02:05:29,520 --> 02:05:30,421
[SPEAKER_29]: That's about two feet.

1365
02:05:30,601 --> 02:05:31,781
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's about two feet of messaging?

1366
02:05:31,861 --> 02:05:34,022
[SPEAKER_29]: That's a lot less.

1367
02:05:34,082 --> 02:05:38,064
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like that's a foot there, so two, three, four, that's three feet of messaging.

1368
02:05:38,344 --> 02:05:40,165
[SPEAKER_29]: This one is the pedestal.

1369
02:05:40,265 --> 02:05:41,066
[SPEAKER_29]: That's the pedestal.

1370
02:05:41,346 --> 02:05:42,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so that takes you a foot out.

1371
02:05:42,967 --> 02:05:44,928
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the pedestal.

1372
02:05:44,948 --> 02:05:46,308
[SPEAKER_02]: So one to four.

1373
02:05:47,469 --> 02:05:49,070
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, the whole width is four.

1374
02:05:49,986 --> 02:05:50,646
[SPEAKER_29]: All the way to the top is four.

1375
02:05:50,666 --> 02:05:51,627
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, the whole thing is four.

1376
02:05:51,647 --> 02:05:52,828
[SPEAKER_29]: So that's half of it, it's two feet.

1377
02:05:52,868 --> 02:05:54,468
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, okay, so that's two feet, okay, okay.

1378
02:05:54,548 --> 02:05:56,630
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought there was a line there, I'm sorry, it's my mistake.

1379
02:05:56,650 --> 02:05:58,270
[SPEAKER_29]: So two feet is going to be.

1380
02:05:58,290 --> 02:06:01,412
[SPEAKER_02]: So two feet, so it'll become almost like a mini movie screen almost?

1381
02:06:01,432 --> 02:06:02,833
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, that's it, yeah.

1382
02:06:03,273 --> 02:06:03,473
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

1383
02:06:03,673 --> 02:06:06,075
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because if you, that's actually.

1384
02:06:06,275 --> 02:06:07,675
[SPEAKER_02]: It's four.

1385
02:06:08,236 --> 02:06:08,996
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, yeah.

1386
02:06:09,776 --> 02:06:16,020
[SPEAKER_29]: The top part of it is going to be the logo and then it's going to be the Evangelical Haitian Church, so that's just basically paper.

1387
02:06:16,814 --> 02:06:18,436
[SPEAKER_29]: That's not going to be illuminated.

1388
02:06:18,596 --> 02:06:20,318
[SPEAKER_29]: It's just the bottom part of it.

1389
02:06:20,338 --> 02:06:20,939
[SPEAKER_29]: That's it.

1390
02:06:21,079 --> 02:06:22,901
[SPEAKER_29]: That's going to have to be the message of the day.

1391
02:06:23,601 --> 02:06:28,427
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, Councilman, I might have a resolution, but I think maybe that's what I'm aiming for.

1392
02:06:28,587 --> 02:06:29,148
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilman?

1393
02:06:29,388 --> 02:06:37,196
[SPEAKER_15]: I personally, Mr. President, have lived next to churches and across from churches with my address on High Street where I have two churches that are right next to me.

1394
02:06:38,394 --> 02:06:41,200
[SPEAKER_15]: One church has a sign and one church doesn't.

1395
02:06:41,220 --> 02:06:47,712
[SPEAKER_15]: The church that has a sign that's in nonconformity with our sign ordinance always has a message posted on it.

1396
02:06:48,393 --> 02:06:50,017
[SPEAKER_15]: The church that doesn't have a sign,

1397
02:06:51,087 --> 02:06:56,132
[SPEAKER_15]: Instead puts two stakes out there and puts a banner out there and they change the banner from time to time and it looks awful.

1398
02:06:56,472 --> 02:06:57,514
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks absolutely terrible.

1399
02:06:58,034 --> 02:06:59,395
[SPEAKER_15]: It's an eyesore to the neighborhood really.

1400
02:06:59,956 --> 02:07:05,682
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that, you know, this isn't going to be harmful provided that we can put some restrictions on it.

1401
02:07:05,722 --> 02:07:06,843
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a special permit request.

1402
02:07:07,023 --> 02:07:11,227
[SPEAKER_15]: They're asking us to issue a special permit and we have some concerns about internal illumination.

1403
02:07:12,068 --> 02:07:28,178
[SPEAKER_15]: Assuming that the concerns of my Councilors have about internal illumination are that they don't want it lighting up the sky at night So we can put restrictions on it eight o'clock nine o'clock ten o'clock Whatever it is that we feel comfortable And we can also put restrictions on it if we approve the side to say that they won't put any hang any banners or any other

1404
02:07:28,538 --> 02:07:31,820
[SPEAKER_15]: type of materials in the front lawn, so ultimately we'll have a clean, crisp look.

1405
02:07:32,100 --> 02:07:48,350
[SPEAKER_15]: It may be a little bit bigger than we're used to, but at least we're still protecting the quality of life in the neighborhood, because I think a big sign that's lit up, that's controlled in the certain hours that it's controlled to be litting up is much better for the neighborhood than two posts that are stuck up there with an old sign that's hanging down the middle, and then it gets changed every three days, and it flaps in the wind, and it looks terrible.

1406
02:07:49,031 --> 02:07:53,337
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm inclined this evening, Mr. President, to support the petition as filed.

1407
02:07:53,397 --> 02:07:59,045
[SPEAKER_15]: However, I know that my colleagues have concerns and I want to be a part of coming up with a solution that we can all have by putting our heads together.

1408
02:07:59,085 --> 02:08:04,993
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that putting restrictions on the application would probably be a solution that could kind of satisfy everybody behind the rail.

1409
02:08:05,810 --> 02:08:17,035
[SPEAKER_27]: My recommendation as chairman of the committee would be, because it's a freestanding sign, because it's internally illuminated, because it involves movement, I think it merits a subcommittee meeting.

1410
02:08:17,675 --> 02:08:21,457
[SPEAKER_27]: We can get one within the next week and a half, two weeks, very soon.

1411
02:08:22,377 --> 02:08:25,058
[SPEAKER_27]: We had one already that I know you were out of town and couldn't attend.

1412
02:08:25,359 --> 02:08:32,702
[SPEAKER_27]: So that would be my recommendation to this body that we meet in subcommittee just to iron out and put forward the best proposal.

1413
02:08:33,522 --> 02:08:43,089
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I too, I wouldn't, I just think, I concur with Councilor Knight putting some restrictions, but I think that has to be done in subcommittee.

1414
02:08:43,129 --> 02:08:49,333
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, I support the subcommittee, moving this to subcommittee and doing it relatively soon.

1415
02:08:50,174 --> 02:08:54,940
[SPEAKER_14]: which we can move pretty quickly, but I think we need that.

1416
02:08:55,380 --> 02:08:55,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1417
02:08:56,361 --> 02:09:06,393
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I withdraw my motion for approval and second the motion that this be sent to the subcommittee on science, et cetera.

1418
02:09:09,114 --> 02:09:13,656
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want to have a second, but second, I don't want to have a second by Councilor Scarpelli.

1419
02:09:13,996 --> 02:09:14,436
[SPEAKER_27]: All in favor.

1420

1533

02:11:16,914 --> 02:11:17,354
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

1540
02:11:17,594 --> 02:11:18,414
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

1541
02:11:19,114 --> 02:11:20,774
[SPEAKER_24]: Is the paper on the committee?

1542
02:11:21,135 --> 02:11:22,775
[SPEAKER_24]: Has the paper come off the floor?

1543
02:11:23,755 --> 02:11:25,975
[SPEAKER_24]: Has the paper come off the floor to approve it?

1544
02:11:26,055 --> 02:11:26,816
[SPEAKER_24]: We just adopted it.

1545
02:11:26,836 --> 02:11:27,996
[SPEAKER_24]: We just adopted it?

1546
02:11:28,036 --> 02:11:28,176
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes.

1547
02:11:37,537 --> 02:11:42,600
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion by Councilor Dello Russo to revert back to regular business.

1548
02:11:42,940 --> 02:11:43,120
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

1549
02:11:44,201 --> 02:11:44,921
[SPEAKER_26]: All in favor, aye.

1550
02:11:44,941 --> 02:11:46,982
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

1551
02:11:47,002 --> 02:11:46,982
17, 595.

1554
02:12:10,182 --> 02:12:18,971
[SPEAKER_26]: Two, a list of all complaints made to the Code Enforcement Officer made regarding the operation of Stone and Skillet located at 186 Winthrop Street.

1555
02:12:20,892 --> 02:12:27,618
[SPEAKER_26]: 3.

1556
02:12:21,453 --> 02:12:27,618
[SPEAKER_26]: A list of all code violations issued to Stone and Skillett located at 186 Winthrop Street.

1557
02:12:28,058 --> 02:12:27,618

02:12:28,498 --> 02:12:36,064
[SPEAKER_26]: A list of complaints made to the Board of Health regarding the operation of Stone and Skillett located at 186 Winthrop Street.

1559
02:12:36,084 --> 02:12:36,064
5.

1560
02:12:36,585 --> 02:12:43,810
[SPEAKER_26]: A list of all complaints made to the Police Department and Traffic Commission regarding the operation of Stone and Skillett located at 186 Winthrop Street. 6.

[SPEAKER_26]: A list of all permits, licenses, or similar documents issued by the City of Medford to the entity known as Stone and Skillett 186 Winter Street.

1562
02:12:56,158 --> 02:12:56,798
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight.

1563
02:12:58,079 --> 02:12:59,920
[SPEAKER_26]: Move approval, Mr. President.

1564
02:12:59,960 --> 02:13:02,721
[SPEAKER_05]: No, table it and allow him to speak when he gets back.

1565
02:13:02,821 --> 02:13:05,923
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, if we could table that until Councilor Knight gets back.

1566
02:13:06,663 --> 02:13:07,264
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

1567
02:13:07,444 --> 02:13:07,684
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

1568
02:13:08,084 --> 02:13:08,764
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

1569
02:13:10,242 --> 02:13:12,945
[SPEAKER_26]: 17-596 offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1570
02:13:13,186 --> 02:13:16,329
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council is presented with a potential.

1571
02:13:17,480 --> 02:13:20,563
[SPEAKER_26]: expenditure bond requests with our bond requests.

1572
02:13:20,663 --> 02:13:25,107
[SPEAKER_26]: We are also presented with an itemized breakdown of how the money will be spent.

1573
02:13:25,267 --> 02:13:36,158
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it further resolved that we be that we be provided with the information at least one week prior to the City Council meeting rather than in the night before being told it's an emergency.

1574
02:13:36,178 --> 02:13:37,138
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1575
02:13:37,579 --> 02:13:39,921
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

1576
02:13:39,941 --> 02:13:43,044
[SPEAKER_05]: This sparked off of our July meeting, I believe.

1577
02:13:43,495 --> 02:13:50,822
[SPEAKER_05]: We were here about 5-ish in the evening and our meeting went until about 12, 12.30 in the morning.

1578
02:13:50,842 --> 02:13:56,848
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the last agenda items was an expenditure of $4.5 million.

1579
02:13:59,597 --> 02:14:04,098
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to, you know, we did vote for it, but I woke up the next morning.

1580
02:14:04,118 --> 02:14:13,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I voiced my frustration with regards to a lack of a breakdown of that money, and then I woke up the next morning and I, you know, was a little frustrated.

1581
02:14:15,101 --> 02:14:16,261
[SPEAKER_05]: My frustration continued.

1582
02:14:16,821 --> 02:14:25,843
[SPEAKER_05]: So I did email finance department, treasurer's department with all my additional questions, and I did eventually get the answers I wanted.

1583
02:14:26,581 --> 02:14:35,326
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a project that obviously needs to be done, but I just wanted to make a point to put it on the agenda to let people know that I was frustrated.

1584
02:14:35,346 --> 02:14:38,127
[SPEAKER_05]: We were given, again, $4.5 million.

1585
02:14:38,167 --> 02:14:53,015
[SPEAKER_05]: We were given an explanation, besides a couple of lines in our agenda, we were given a four or five page explanation of the project broken down by individual street the night of our meeting.

1586
02:14:53,532 --> 02:14:58,876
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we notice it, it all depends on when we read additional information that's on our desk.

1587
02:14:59,217 --> 02:15:04,300
[SPEAKER_05]: I was paying attention to the meeting and I didn't see it until it was actually before us.

1588
02:15:04,861 --> 02:15:11,986
[SPEAKER_05]: Scrambling to read it the night of a meeting at 11.30, 12 o'clock at night, it's difficult.

1589
02:15:12,747 --> 02:15:20,253
[SPEAKER_05]: Lights were beaming on us and we were tired and it's some information that I would expect to receive at least

1590
02:15:20,746 --> 02:15:23,629
[SPEAKER_05]: a week prior to a vote of such magnitude.

1591
02:15:24,169 --> 02:15:26,791
[SPEAKER_05]: So I wanted to get a vote by the council.

1592
02:15:28,072 --> 02:15:32,096
[SPEAKER_05]: And to continue with that, the explanation didn't have a breakdown of the money.

1593
02:15:32,957 --> 02:15:39,502
[SPEAKER_05]: It was broken down two different ways how we were going to get the money, but it wasn't broken down by street.

1594
02:15:39,662 --> 02:15:48,250
[SPEAKER_05]: Thankfully, I got it the next day, but I would just like to request that the administration provides us

1595
02:15:49,123 --> 02:15:51,485
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we always talk about transparency.

1596
02:15:51,505 --> 02:15:57,390
[SPEAKER_05]: I just would like that we be provided information on expenditures a week prior to the meeting.

1597
02:15:57,751 --> 02:16:07,739
[SPEAKER_05]: That it be something, you know, we stuck strong tonight and we obviously hopefully will create some change going down the line on trench work and road work within our city.

1598
02:16:08,560 --> 02:16:10,742
[SPEAKER_05]: We stuck strong and had parking enforcement.

1599
02:16:12,577 --> 02:16:15,059
[SPEAKER_05]: a few months ago, and we made significant changes.

1600
02:16:15,079 --> 02:16:23,846
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we need to stick together as a body and say to our administration, we need information before it is presented on our council agenda.

1601
02:16:24,146 --> 02:16:32,373
[SPEAKER_05]: We should not be given information on a project, on an expenditure, on a bond request, the night of our meeting, at 7 o'clock at night.

1602
02:16:32,473 --> 02:16:36,075
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be weeks, if not days, before our meeting.

1603
02:16:36,476 --> 02:16:39,278
[SPEAKER_05]: And that expenditure should be broken down in detail.

1604
02:16:39,610 --> 02:16:41,052
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something that wasn't done for us.

1605
02:16:41,112 --> 02:16:44,576
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's something we're, as a body, not mandating.

1606
02:16:44,716 --> 02:16:52,806
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I'd like to take a vote tonight that we request and mandate that we be given an explanation and a

1607
02:16:53,801 --> 02:17:06,585
[SPEAKER_05]: expenditure breakdown seven days prior to our meeting and make a change and all stick together and try to be able to, I mean, it's very frustrating when you know, oh, the next day somebody is going to be asking you questions about it and you don't have it.

1608
02:17:06,665 --> 02:17:11,427
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't have the information of how much money is going to go to Paris Street, how much money is going to go to Evans Street.

1609
02:17:11,487 --> 02:17:12,147
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't know that.

1610
02:17:12,667 --> 02:17:13,487
[SPEAKER_05]: We voted for it.

1611
02:17:13,547 --> 02:17:14,287
[SPEAKER_05]: It was very late.

1612
02:17:16,108 --> 02:17:25,338
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the way it happened, but I think going forward, we owe it to the taxpayers of this community to get information prior to taking such serious votes.

1613
02:17:25,878 --> 02:17:32,545
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd ask for a roll call vote on this and hopefully we can stick together and make a stand.

1614
02:17:33,266 --> 02:17:33,546
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1615
02:17:33,586 --> 02:17:35,188
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

1616
02:17:35,208 --> 02:17:36,850
[SPEAKER_26]: Did you want to speak?

1617
02:17:39,702 --> 02:17:40,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Name and address of the record, please.

1618
02:17:40,922 --> 02:17:42,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1619
02:17:42,403 --> 02:17:44,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

1620
02:17:45,504 --> 02:17:46,585
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a fraud.

1621
02:17:48,065 --> 02:17:56,009
[SPEAKER_09]: This kind of pertains to what Councilor Breanna Lungo-Koehn is talking about, but I had to leave that meeting that night.

1622
02:17:56,109 --> 02:18:04,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, with the breakdown of that money, can I ask, was Evans Street a part of that?

1623
02:18:05,472 --> 02:18:06,133
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn?

1624
02:18:08,399 --> 02:18:10,441
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll forward you the breakdown.

1625
02:18:10,521 --> 02:18:11,902
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a page or two.

1626
02:18:11,942 --> 02:18:14,684
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't believe it was.

1627
02:18:14,904 --> 02:18:23,110
[SPEAKER_09]: From what I heard, what happened was, after being told the street was going to be fixed this year, it's not.

1628
02:18:24,471 --> 02:18:25,611
[SPEAKER_09]: This year.

1629
02:18:25,651 --> 02:18:26,192
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.

1630
02:18:26,232 --> 02:18:27,113
[SPEAKER_09]: That's right.

1631
02:18:27,253 --> 02:18:29,394
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, I think you may be correct.

1632
02:18:29,474 --> 02:18:34,618
[SPEAKER_15]: And the street was not included in that expenditure request that came forward as being funded through another

1633
02:18:35,398 --> 02:18:41,742
[SPEAKER_15]: process, and from what I understand, now, I'm pretty frustrated about the 7th Street thing, too.

1634
02:18:41,842 --> 02:18:44,443
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we're looking at this 24, maybe 36 months now.

1635
02:18:44,783 --> 02:18:46,044
[SPEAKER_15]: It's been going on.

1636
02:18:46,144 --> 02:18:47,045
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, it's going out to bid.

1637
02:18:47,085 --> 02:18:48,145
[SPEAKER_15]: It's going to be out to bid in May.

1638
02:18:48,205 --> 02:18:50,166
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the bid never got awarded in May.

1639
02:18:51,127 --> 02:18:53,328
[SPEAKER_15]: Then, you know, work's going to start, you know, May, June.

1640
02:18:53,468 --> 02:18:54,309
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, now it's August.

1641
02:18:54,349 --> 02:18:55,089
[SPEAKER_15]: Work still hasn't started.

1642
02:18:55,869 --> 02:18:57,630
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm a little frustrated with the situation as well.

1643
02:18:57,670 --> 02:19:00,612
[SPEAKER_15]: But the answer to your question, no, it wasn't included in that.

1644
02:19:00,672 --> 02:19:02,213
[SPEAKER_15]: It's being funded through a different mechanism and a

1645
02:19:03,128 --> 02:19:07,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I have it in front of me just to go through the through the list.

1646
02:19:07,452 --> 02:19:09,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Grove Street and Linden Street, new water mains, 830,000.

1647
02:19:10,034 --> 02:19:12,176
[SPEAKER_05]: Power Street and Pinkert Street, new water mains, 790,000.

1648
02:19:12,216 --> 02:19:13,016
[SPEAKER_05]: Hydraulic model citywide, 30,000.

1649
02:19:13,057 --> 02:19:13,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Water meters, 150,000.

1650
02:19:13,557 --> 02:19:13,817
[SPEAKER_05]: MTU, 75,000.

1651
02:19:13,857 --> 02:19:15,298
[SPEAKER_05]: 225, project is 350 in the 125 in enterprise budget.

1652
02:19:15,799 --> 02:19:17,380
[SPEAKER_05]: Private lead service replacement was 200,000.

1653
02:19:31,677 --> 02:19:35,419
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes into more detail, and then it says the contract is broken down as follows.

1654
02:19:37,860 --> 02:19:47,925
[SPEAKER_05]: Year one, $1,298,445.09, water service and water main replacement as followed, and then Evans Street is listed under water main replacement.

1655
02:19:48,505 --> 02:19:53,307
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's no construction of the road within this, but Evans Street, they do plan on.

1656
02:19:53,327 --> 02:19:55,028
[SPEAKER_09]: This year?

1657
02:19:56,642 --> 02:20:02,706
[SPEAKER_05]: year one of the contract, so I think that would be 2017, beginning of 2018, if I can recall.

1658
02:20:03,646 --> 02:20:05,667
[SPEAKER_09]: So how are they going to do that work in the winter?

1659
02:20:07,408 --> 02:20:07,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.

1660
02:20:08,109 --> 02:20:15,613
[SPEAKER_09]: And how can you say that they're going to do water main repair without, I mean, to get to the water main, you have to dig up the street, so obviously.

1661
02:20:15,633 --> 02:20:19,815
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why they have to resurface the street, because they want to dig it up to make the water main surface.

1662
02:20:19,835 --> 02:20:22,497
[SPEAKER_05]: That was always the plan, we were just hoping it would be repaved by now.

1663
02:20:23,295 --> 02:20:34,171
[SPEAKER_15]: What happened was the contract got awarded, Mr. Capucci, and then when the engineering department said that these should construction schedule new construction criteria, they said we can't meet those criteria, so you have to re-bid the construction.

1664
02:20:34,992 --> 02:20:37,115
[SPEAKER_15]: So they backed out of the deal after they were awarded the contract.

1665
02:20:38,377 --> 02:20:46,983
[SPEAKER_15]: But from what I understand, they weren't one of the preferred vendors that the city uses anyhow, so the product that they put out isn't necessarily one of the better ones.

1666
02:20:47,003 --> 02:20:49,205
[SPEAKER_15]: But based upon the public bid laws, that's who we were stuck with.

1667
02:20:49,225 --> 02:20:57,510
[SPEAKER_15]: So although it's been taking a long time, the delay may be a blessing because from what I understand, the workmanship of that entity isn't necessarily the best of the best.

1668
02:20:58,311 --> 02:20:59,071
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know about it.

1669
02:21:00,212 --> 02:21:09,698
[SPEAKER_09]: It being a blessing, Councilor Knight, the residents on my street, knowing that I come to a lot of the city council meetings, they have been asking me for months now.

1670
02:21:10,819 --> 02:21:15,301
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. Cappuccio, I'm in full agreement with the residents on your street that know that I come to a lot of city council meetings, too.

1671
02:21:15,321 --> 02:21:16,362
[SPEAKER_15]: Call me and say the same thing.

1672
02:21:16,602 --> 02:21:16,782
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1673
02:21:16,902 --> 02:21:17,463
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not.

1674
02:21:18,663 --> 02:21:27,146
[SPEAKER_09]: I do not hold this council accountable for the street and road repair on Medford Street pertaining to this year.

1675
02:21:28,326 --> 02:21:31,387
[SPEAKER_09]: It's been decades since the street has been serviced.

1676
02:21:31,927 --> 02:21:44,010
[SPEAKER_09]: I speak tonight in favor of Councilor Lungo-Koehn's resolution to have the specificities on future appropriations outlined because

1677
02:21:46,571 --> 02:21:59,098
[SPEAKER_09]: The administration put out a letter that in good faith these councillors looked at and then notified the residents on my street, who for years have been wanting Evans Street to be fixed.

1678
02:21:59,638 --> 02:22:02,080
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it was appropriate for you to do so.

1679
02:22:02,520 --> 02:22:14,086
[SPEAKER_09]: But then along the chain of departments that it has to go through, the engineer's office, the purchaser's office, then out for bids, then back to the mayor to choose the bids.

1680
02:22:17,375 --> 02:22:18,716
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a serious ball dropped.

1681
02:22:19,896 --> 02:22:24,498
[SPEAKER_09]: I wish the residents on my street weren't told that it was going to be done in May.

1682
02:22:24,878 --> 02:22:42,686
[SPEAKER_09]: But I hope that you stand resolved to hold whatever administration is in power to doing simple things like street and road repair, especially when it's gone for decades neglected.

1683
02:22:43,727 --> 02:22:58,538
[SPEAKER_09]: In a city that through different accounts I mean I sat through all the subcommittee meetings on on the budget and I see how expenditures not paid get thrown back into the general fund to where it's now ballooned into tens of millions of dollars and

1684
02:22:58,698 --> 02:23:09,452
[SPEAKER_09]: and to tell any resident of it, the people that came up before on brokers or curbs, go up Adam Street on the hillside, go on any street up in the heights.

1685
02:23:10,153 --> 02:23:17,002
[SPEAKER_09]: For this city to be sitting on so much money in simple things like road repairs, I'm thinking done, it's done.

1686
02:23:19,206 --> 02:23:21,330
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a little disheartening for lack of a better term.

1687
02:23:21,450 --> 02:23:27,682
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope that you all vote in the affirmative on Councilor Brianna Longo's current excellent resolution.

1688
02:23:27,722 --> 02:23:28,042
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1689
02:23:28,062 --> 02:23:28,343
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1690
02:23:32,200 --> 02:23:33,221
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address of the record, please.

1691
02:23:34,102 --> 02:23:35,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Dave McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

1692
02:23:36,664 --> 02:23:45,252
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this just goes back to a testament of having a yearly comprehensive strategic plan in place for these processes.

1693
02:23:45,992 --> 02:23:53,919
[SPEAKER_07]: To actually sit down and actually have to vote on something at midnight on something that needs to be acted on relatively quick is absurd.

1694
02:23:54,040 --> 02:23:55,881
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes no sense for a city to work that way.

1695
02:23:57,142 --> 02:24:04,504
[SPEAKER_07]: when you want to sit down and come up with a comprehensive plan for the following year, that discussion should have already taken place in the month of August.

1696
02:24:04,884 --> 02:24:13,105
[SPEAKER_07]: It should already be ready for the following year as to what we are going to do as a city and what actions we are going to take and what monies we need to do that.

1697
02:24:13,185 --> 02:24:14,786
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a proactive plan.

1698
02:24:14,926 --> 02:24:26,608
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that, you know, Councilor Cohen's suggestion to at least have seven days is admirable, but I think it really has to be something that the council should really come together on

1699
02:24:27,568 --> 02:24:46,178
[SPEAKER_07]: team spirit wise and say hey, from this point on, we will not accept anything that isn't a comprehensive plan that gives the city and the budget enough time to plan for this and move forward and feel comfortable that it can be done and can be done on a timely basis so the citizens can feel good about the projects that are in front of them.

1700
02:24:46,578 --> 02:24:46,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1701
02:24:47,098 --> 02:24:47,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1702
02:24:47,399 --> 02:24:47,799
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1703
02:24:49,380 --> 02:24:50,900
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Lococo.

1704
02:24:50,940 --> 02:24:55,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Through the Chair, just my last vote, my last point, I do ask for the support on this.

1705
02:24:56,567 --> 02:25:06,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Having been frustrated and emailed the administration the next day, I received a detailed breakdown by I think it was 1.05 p.m.

1706
02:25:06,532 --> 02:25:14,116
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's no reason why we shouldn't be provided a breakdown of expenditures prior to our meeting.

1707
02:25:14,736 --> 02:25:18,758
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think it's a lack of respect and I think that needs to change.

1708
02:25:19,363 --> 02:25:19,623
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1709
02:25:38,268 --> 02:25:57,381
[SPEAKER_27]: present expenditures to us with no supporting documentation and either the council may or may not support it and In my opinion, I know what you're trying to get at through this resolution, but all it is is a request Madam mayor, will you please give us supporting documentation when you ask for expenditure now?

1710
02:25:57,482 --> 02:25:58,322
[SPEAKER_27]: She could say okay.

1711
02:25:58,342 --> 02:25:59,503
[SPEAKER_27]: I'll take that under advisement

1712
02:26:00,149 --> 02:26:04,857
[SPEAKER_27]: The bigger issue that we have as a council is our council rules.

1713
02:26:05,538 --> 02:26:14,071
[SPEAKER_27]: We have a council rule that states any request of expenditure only needs one member of the city council to stand up and say, you know what?

1714
02:26:15,537 --> 02:26:16,458
[SPEAKER_27]: I want this tabled.

1715
02:26:17,179 --> 02:26:18,580
[SPEAKER_27]: You don't need a vote of the council.

1716
02:26:18,900 --> 02:26:24,607
[SPEAKER_27]: It's one member of the city council saying, I need this tabled, and it gets tabled automatically.

1717
02:26:25,328 --> 02:26:26,689
[SPEAKER_27]: And that's our check and balance.

1718
02:26:27,050 --> 02:26:32,316
[SPEAKER_27]: So when something's presented to us and you feel there's not enough information, you evoke the council rule.

1719
02:26:33,279 --> 02:26:36,062
[SPEAKER_27]: that would request that it be laid on the table.

1720
02:26:36,302 --> 02:26:37,283
[SPEAKER_27]: And there's no vote on it.

1721
02:26:37,423 --> 02:26:38,123
[SPEAKER_27]: It's automatic.

1722
02:26:38,524 --> 02:26:42,407
[SPEAKER_27]: So I would state that we do have options out there.

1723
02:26:42,968 --> 02:26:44,829
[SPEAKER_27]: And a request to the mayor now is great.

1724
02:26:44,889 --> 02:26:47,852
[SPEAKER_27]: And if the mayor starts adhering to that, super.

1725
02:26:48,332 --> 02:26:50,254
[SPEAKER_27]: But I wouldn't put all my eggs in that basket.

1726
02:26:50,614 --> 02:26:54,238
[SPEAKER_27]: I think we as a council have to use the remedies that we have.

1727
02:26:54,618 --> 02:26:56,460
[SPEAKER_27]: And one of them is our own council rules.

1728
02:26:57,000 --> 02:27:12,228
[SPEAKER_27]: So, I would highly recommend to my council colleagues that if there is expenditure and you feel that there's not an appropriate amount of time or information, that that rule be evoked and automatically gets laid at least for one week so we can get additional documentation.

1729
02:27:12,548 --> 02:27:17,370
[SPEAKER_27]: I will support the paper tonight in principle, but I really don't think it has any teeth.

1730
02:27:17,790 --> 02:27:19,171
[SPEAKER_27]: But I'll support it in principle.

1731
02:27:19,511 --> 02:27:20,472
[SPEAKER_24]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

1732
02:27:21,352 --> 02:27:22,192
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Galarruso.

1733
02:27:22,212 --> 02:27:24,013
[SPEAKER_19]: I agree with Councilor Marks on the matter.

1734
02:27:24,073 --> 02:27:28,915
[SPEAKER_19]: In fact, with the way the resolution is written, I don't even know who it's addressed for to.

1735
02:27:31,095 --> 02:27:33,076
[SPEAKER_19]: So thank you, Mr. President.

1736
02:27:33,276 --> 02:27:34,697
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1737
02:27:34,957 --> 02:27:35,557
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Layton.

1738
02:27:35,797 --> 02:27:37,958
[SPEAKER_15]: I think Councilor Marks is on the right track, Mr. President.

1739
02:27:38,338 --> 02:27:45,000
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's, you know, council rules can dictate whether or not this is something that we can handle ourselves without having to make a request to the mayor.

1740
02:27:45,620 --> 02:27:56,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, if we look in our council rules, it says every ordinance and every order for a bond issue shall before its passage be referred to the solicitor who shall forthwith examine its legality and respond back to the council in writing thereof.

1741
02:27:57,342 --> 02:27:57,662
[SPEAKER_15]: Rule 22.

1742
02:27:57,702 --> 02:28:03,023
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, there are a couple of remedies in there for us to take.

1743
02:28:03,523 --> 02:28:07,464
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think that we should just do them ourselves as opposed to kicking it across the hallway.

1744
02:28:08,224 --> 02:28:09,184
[SPEAKER_15]: We've voted on this in the past.

1745
02:28:09,224 --> 02:28:11,124
[SPEAKER_15]: I've supported this measure in the past, Mr. President.

1746
02:28:11,144 --> 02:28:13,825
[SPEAKER_15]: Some of the frustrations that my councilors share,

1747
02:28:15,165 --> 02:28:19,568
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't see as much of a, I have a strong working relationship with the administration, past and present.

1748
02:28:19,889 --> 02:28:22,651
[SPEAKER_15]: I pick up the phone when I get my agenda and I talk about issues that I have questions on.

1749
02:28:23,671 --> 02:28:27,154
[SPEAKER_15]: But maybe some people don't have that type of access, I don't know.

1750
02:28:28,035 --> 02:28:30,556
[SPEAKER_15]: I do the best I can to get the information and be prepared for the meeting.

1751
02:28:31,097 --> 02:28:36,761
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think that our council rules could really dictate what direction that we can go in and how we can police this ourselves as opposed to relying on someone else to do it.

1752
02:28:37,281 --> 02:28:40,724
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's something I've supported in the past, I certainly have, but this evening I won't be.

1753
02:28:41,411 --> 02:28:43,194
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Naito.

1754
02:28:43,896 --> 02:28:47,823
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Mango-Curran, it's getting late.

1755
02:28:47,943 --> 02:28:50,468
[SPEAKER_26]: Seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

1756
02:28:54,880 --> 02:28:56,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1757
02:28:56,201 --> 02:28:57,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Rob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

1758
02:28:58,662 --> 02:29:17,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Just really brief, I completely understand what Councilor Marks is saying, but on the flip side, what Councilor Lungo-Koehn is saying is the presentation of these appropriations coming in as dire and needed and at the last minute to invoke that

1759
02:29:20,571 --> 02:29:24,554
[SPEAKER_09]: It's it's almost it's almost like sets up the council to look bad.

1760
02:29:25,034 --> 02:29:27,296
[SPEAKER_09]: It's it's I think it's quite frankly the

1761
02:29:32,809 --> 02:29:35,391
[SPEAKER_15]: item doesn't have to make the agenda if we don't have the information that we need.

1762
02:29:36,632 --> 02:29:40,075
[SPEAKER_15]: Just because the mayor sends a paper and says, put this on the agenda, it doesn't have to happen the next week.

1763
02:29:40,375 --> 02:29:41,296
[SPEAKER_15]: We control our own agenda.

1764
02:29:41,316 --> 02:29:42,797
[SPEAKER_15]: We control when the items and matters come up.

1765
02:29:43,278 --> 02:29:49,022
[SPEAKER_15]: So if we get a paper that says, put this on the agenda, we say, well, let's talk about the council, but when do we want to put this on the agenda?

1766
02:29:49,042 --> 02:29:50,944
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe we have six papers that are coming up for bonds.

1767
02:29:50,964 --> 02:29:57,489
[SPEAKER_15]: And let's talk about bonding for a whole meeting and have a universal picture of what's going on in the city of Medford in terms of bonding instead of doing it

1768
02:29:58,430 --> 02:29:59,250
[SPEAKER_15]: play and connect the dots.

1769
02:29:59,530 --> 02:30:01,771
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, there's different ways that we can handle this.

1770
02:30:01,971 --> 02:30:02,611
[SPEAKER_20]: The question.

1771
02:30:02,871 --> 02:30:03,071
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1772
02:30:03,411 --> 02:30:13,253
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that Council of Councilor Knight, but when they do come up at the midnight hour, I, I don't think that this resolution lacks teeth.

1773
02:30:13,634 --> 02:30:27,417
[SPEAKER_09]: I think what Councilor Lungo-Koehn is doing astutely is sending a message not only to the mayor, but a separate message to the people that you guys represent, that we are going to do something about

1774
02:30:28,577 --> 02:30:29,778
[SPEAKER_09]: your taxpayer dollars.

1775
02:30:29,818 --> 02:30:30,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1776
02:30:30,138 --> 02:30:30,619
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1777
02:30:30,899 --> 02:30:33,581
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Longo-Curran, seconded by Dello Russo.

1778
02:30:34,101 --> 02:30:35,842
[SPEAKER_26]: A roll call vote has been requested.

1779
02:30:36,543 --> 02:30:37,844
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1780
02:30:38,024 --> 02:30:38,885
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Dello Russo?

1781
02:30:38,925 --> 02:30:39,145
[SPEAKER_26]: No.

1782
02:30:40,426 --> 02:30:41,186
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Falco?

1783
02:30:41,226 --> 02:30:41,446
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1784
02:30:42,347 --> 02:30:42,887
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight?

1785
02:30:42,948 --> 02:30:43,128
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

1786
02:30:44,288 --> 02:30:45,029
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Longo-Curran?

1787
02:30:45,049 --> 02:30:45,289
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1788
02:30:46,590 --> 02:30:47,311
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Marx?

1789
02:30:47,451 --> 02:30:47,691
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1790
02:30:48,712 --> 02:30:49,512
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1791
02:30:49,692 --> 02:30:49,953
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1792
02:30:50,733 --> 02:30:51,434
[SPEAKER_22]: President Caraviello?

1793
02:30:51,474 --> 02:30:51,634
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

1794
02:30:54,006 --> 02:30:56,870
[SPEAKER_26]: 5 in the affirmative, 2 in the negative, motion passes.

1795
02:30:56,950 --> 02:30:58,332
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion to revert back to 17-595.

1796
02:30:58,352 --> 02:30:59,693
[SPEAKER_26]: It's council at night.

1797
02:31:04,364 --> 02:31:04,945
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1798
02:31:04,965 --> 02:31:05,585
[SPEAKER_26]: Stone and Skillet.

1799
02:31:07,206 --> 02:31:11,570
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Stone and Skillet, Mr. President, is located on the corner of West and Winthrop.

1800
02:31:11,610 --> 02:31:19,216
[SPEAKER_15]: It is a bakery wholesaler that over the past several months has not been the greatest of neighbors, Mr. President.

1801
02:31:19,396 --> 02:31:26,161
[SPEAKER_15]: I've received a number of complaints from area residents concerning their hours of operation, the cleanliness of the facility.

1802
02:31:27,501 --> 02:31:29,062
[SPEAKER_15]: and some parking concerns that they have.

1803
02:31:29,142 --> 02:31:34,743
[SPEAKER_15]: Ultimately, this bakery wholesaler has operated in excess of our hours of operation.

1804
02:31:35,483 --> 02:31:37,944
[SPEAKER_15]: They're permitted to operate from 7 a.m.

1805
02:31:38,204 --> 02:31:38,984
[SPEAKER_15]: to 11 p.m.

1806
02:31:39,804 --> 02:31:49,767
[SPEAKER_15]: Between May 1st and June 22nd, I personally reported 16 violations of operation after hours.

1807
02:31:50,587 --> 02:32:06,513
[SPEAKER_15]: This coupled with the fact that there's a dedicated parking spot beside the building for 30 minute parking which has turned into stone and skillets personal loading zone for their renter car, renter truck, 18 wheeler that sits there for 7 to 8 to 9 to 10 hours a day without moving.

1808
02:32:07,634 --> 02:32:12,856
[SPEAKER_15]: The facility and the grounds around it are in deplorable condition, Mr. President.

1809
02:32:13,296 --> 02:32:22,383
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm asking for these materials so that we can move forward and investigate whether or not there's anything that we can do to designate them as a public nuisance and move them out of the neighborhood.

1810
02:32:23,284 --> 02:32:34,852
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's been brought to my attention in recent weeks since I filed this resolution that a gigantic for rent sign has been placed on the side of the building which would lead me to believe that Stone and Skillet is on their way out of the community.

1811
02:32:36,153 --> 02:32:40,674
[SPEAKER_15]: The bakery wholesale does not fall under the jurisdiction by state law of our local Board of Health.

1812
02:32:40,714 --> 02:32:42,454
[SPEAKER_15]: They're controlled by the state Board of Health.

1813
02:32:42,534 --> 02:32:49,695
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have very limited recourse concerning our concerns about the cleanliness of the facility and what's going on around it.

1814
02:32:50,456 --> 02:33:01,618
[SPEAKER_15]: However, with this good news coming forward that they are putting the place up for rent, I'd still ask the paper to move forward and for us to be prepared, because they said they were gonna move last year, they said they were gonna move the year before that, and they haven't, Mr. President.

1815
02:33:01,638 --> 02:33:03,498
[SPEAKER_15]: They've certainly outgrown this facility.

1816
02:33:04,739 --> 02:33:07,661
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think it's time that they find a new location.

1817
02:33:07,981 --> 02:33:25,214
[SPEAKER_15]: Whether that location is in the city of Medford or somewhere else is to be determined, Mr. President, but right now I think that these residents have been subjected to enough quality of life issues down there that the benefits that Stone and Skill are bringing to the community are lacking and the impact on the quality of life that they have is major.

1818
02:33:25,595 --> 02:33:29,478
[SPEAKER_15]: And for that reason, I bring this resolution forward and ask my council colleagues to support it.

1819
02:33:29,967 --> 02:33:30,347
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1820
02:33:30,788 --> 02:33:34,191
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Nice, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

1821
02:33:35,212 --> 02:33:35,952
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

1822
02:33:36,313 --> 02:33:36,453
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1823
02:33:36,873 --> 02:33:38,995
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

1824
02:33:39,015 --> 02:33:51,106
[SPEAKER_26]: 17-597, offered by Councilor Locario, be it resolved that the Medford City Council set up a Committee of the Whole meeting on the 19th or the 26th of September to discuss and review a potential new ordinance

1825
02:33:52,367 --> 02:33:56,229
[SPEAKER_26]: to help remedy level three gas leaks within Medford.

1826
02:33:56,269 --> 02:33:57,550
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Longo, if you're in.

1827
02:33:57,590 --> 02:33:58,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

1828
02:33:58,971 --> 02:34:13,599
[SPEAKER_05]: A few months ago, well, not even, I don't think, probably June, I brought up a City of Boston ordinance that was regarding gas leaks, level three gas leaks.

1829
02:34:13,939 --> 02:34:21,223
[SPEAKER_05]: And the City of Boston is taking measures to hold the utility companies accountable and to remedy those gas leaks.

1830
02:34:22,140 --> 02:34:23,040
[SPEAKER_05]: in-depth ordinance.

1831
02:34:23,241 --> 02:34:28,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I did forward it to the city clerk who I then saw forwarded it to the rest of my colleagues.

1832
02:34:28,343 --> 02:34:32,805
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is almost just a reminder to maybe hopefully take a read and we can do something about it.

1833
02:34:33,606 --> 02:34:37,688
[SPEAKER_05]: This issue was brought to me by a citizen who probably is going to speak on it, Mr. Tudin.

1834
02:34:38,528 --> 02:34:48,093
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it was led in Boston by a group of moms who are trying to prevent gas leaks because of all the damage they do to you can... The gas bill?

1835
02:34:48,674 --> 02:34:49,714
[SPEAKER_05]: The gas bill, number one.

1836
02:34:49,754 --> 02:34:51,515
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's a safety issue and it

1837
02:34:52,719 --> 02:35:13,453
[SPEAKER_05]: wildlife and the environment, it's not a good thing and we'd like to see what they're doing, read about it and hopefully craft our own ordinance to accommodate our needs and hopefully get the city engineer on board and give her a tool to make sure that when a street is dug up, gas leaks are looked into and fixed.

1838
02:35:14,033 --> 02:35:20,438
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would hope that we can review and come up with an ordinance sometime in September so we can move approval on this.

1839
02:35:20,927 --> 02:35:21,728
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Dello Russo.

1840
02:35:22,088 --> 02:35:48,369
[SPEAKER_19]: President, we have a paper from the mayor tonight that I think addresses part of this issue, Mr. President, that is being taken up by the State House to address it on a state level by creating an act relative to protecting consumers of gas and electricity from paying for leaks on unaccounted gas, which will of course force

1841
02:35:50,711 --> 02:35:57,655
[SPEAKER_19]: the gas company to deal with leaks because it gets them where it counts, in their pocketbooks, because that's what it's all about.

1842
02:35:58,576 --> 02:36:02,378
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I don't know if this has to go to Committee of the Whole.

1843
02:36:02,418 --> 02:36:07,682
[SPEAKER_19]: I would think that procedurally the best thing to do would be to send this to the Committee on Ordinances.

1844
02:36:08,162 --> 02:36:24,432
[SPEAKER_19]: to review the draft of the Bardston ordinance to ask the city solicitor to be in attendance at that meeting to add his expert legal advice and then report it out as is often outlined by the proper procedure by Councilor Knight.

1845
02:36:24,712 --> 02:36:28,595
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Langlois-Carrion, would you prefer this go to the subcommittee and audiences?

1846
02:36:29,274 --> 02:36:31,935
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a good ordinance the way Boston has it written.

1847
02:36:32,015 --> 02:36:39,398
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it just requires a review, and the city solicitors sit with us as an entire body, which is going to end up in Committee of the Whole anyway.

1848
02:36:39,418 --> 02:36:43,439
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it has to be redrafted in much a way.

1849
02:36:43,579 --> 02:36:50,502
[SPEAKER_05]: I think Committee of the Whole meeting would be preferable to move it forward quicker rather than take months and months to

1850
02:36:51,580 --> 02:36:52,340
[SPEAKER_05]: get two meetings set up.

1851
02:36:52,360 --> 02:36:53,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we can do it in one meeting.

1852
02:36:53,300 --> 02:37:01,462
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Lara Curran to have a Committee of the Whole meeting on the 19th and 26th of September, seconded by Councilor Falco.

1853
02:37:01,522 --> 02:37:02,182
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

1854
02:37:02,542 --> 02:37:02,622
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

1855
02:37:03,022 --> 02:37:03,702
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passed.

1856
02:37:05,502 --> 02:37:07,943
[SPEAKER_26]: Mock Councilor Dello Russo in opposition.

1857
02:37:08,183 --> 02:37:08,943
[SPEAKER_26]: Also Mr. President.

1858
02:37:09,723 --> 02:37:09,863
[SPEAKER_26]: Sorry?

1859
02:37:09,903 --> 02:37:11,283
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd like to be mocked in opposition.

1860
02:37:11,363 --> 02:37:12,604
[SPEAKER_26]: And also Councilor Knight.

1861
02:37:15,244 --> 02:37:15,864
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll do my best.

1862
02:37:15,904 --> 02:37:17,785
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll see what's on the calendar for the 19th and 26th.

1863
02:37:17,825 --> 02:37:20,145
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think somebody might want to speak on it.

1864
02:37:20,810 --> 02:37:21,593
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, just real quick.

1865
02:37:22,456 --> 02:37:23,098
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been disposed of.

1866
02:37:24,816 --> 02:37:28,178
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Curtis Student, 340 High Street, Medford, Massachusetts.

1867
02:37:28,218 --> 02:37:38,884
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to invite the council to a meeting on August 22nd, which is of the 350 Massachusetts Mystic Valley organization that has been dedicated to looking at this gas leak issue.

1868
02:37:39,244 --> 02:37:51,891
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have a meeting specifically about level three gas leaks in Medford, so if any Councilor or any resident of Medford doesn't want to wait until September to learn more about it, they're welcome to come to a meeting here at Medford High School, 7 o'clock, and you'll

1869
02:37:52,312 --> 02:37:53,697
[SPEAKER_00]: learn everything you need to know about the issue.

1870
02:37:53,717 --> 02:37:55,505
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to make sure people were aware of that meeting.

1871
02:37:55,645 --> 02:37:55,926
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1872
02:37:55,966 --> 02:37:57,071
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you for that information.

1873
02:37:58,543 --> 02:38:21,573
[SPEAKER_26]: 17-598, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Director of Purchasing provide the City of Medford Council with an update on the implementation of the Wage Theft Ordinance, and be it further resolved that the Director of Purchasing provide the City, provide the Council with a list of all vendors awarded contracts for fiscal year 2017 and 2018.

1874
02:38:22,574 --> 02:38:23,214
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight.

1875
02:38:23,534 --> 02:38:24,855
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1876
02:38:25,795 --> 02:38:39,328
[SPEAKER_15]: Back a few months ago this council passed a wage theft ordinance, and a wage theft ordinance is designed to ensure that taxpayer dollars that are being paid to public contractors are then passed on to their employees pursuant to the public wage laws.

1877
02:38:39,408 --> 02:38:50,259
[SPEAKER_15]: What happens a lot of times in these instances is an individual that works for a private contractor that lays pipe, for example, with all these groups that we had this evening, that's working on a public works project laying pipe,

1878
02:38:50,769 --> 02:38:55,752
[SPEAKER_15]: is going to have to be compensated at the prevailing wage rates established by the Department of Industry.

1879
02:38:56,512 --> 02:39:06,337
[SPEAKER_15]: And a lot of times what happens is when a private contractor gets a public contract, they continue to pay their employees at a rate that's far less than the prevailing wage rate, and then they pocket the difference.

1880
02:39:07,097 --> 02:39:10,098
[SPEAKER_15]: And the laws are clear in what they call for.

1881
02:39:10,158 --> 02:39:14,358
[SPEAKER_15]: They call for individuals working on a public work project to be compensated at the prevailing wage rate.

1882
02:39:14,879 --> 02:39:19,319
[SPEAKER_15]: Taxpayer dollars are being funneled away from workers and being funneled into the pockets of profiteers.

1883
02:39:20,080 --> 02:39:22,240
[SPEAKER_15]: So we passed the wage theft ordinance, Mr. President.

1884
02:39:22,320 --> 02:39:35,263
[SPEAKER_15]: Part of the wage theft ordinance called for the city to examine whether or not any of the existing contracts have been included on the disbarment list at the Attorney General's office or found in violation of any wage and hour laws that are established at the state and federal levels.

1885
02:39:37,703 --> 02:39:58,928
[SPEAKER_15]: ordinance is now up and running and in effect, Mr. President, I'd just like to get a report back from the administration as to what steps they're taking to implement and whether or not any of the contractors that we've awarded contracts to have actually been found in violation of any of the state of federal wage laws or have been included on the state disbarment list so that they're exempt and precluded from bidding on future public works projects, Mr. President.

1886
02:39:59,248 --> 02:40:00,168
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1887
02:40:03,940 --> 02:40:05,061
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address of the record, please.

1888
02:40:05,362 --> 02:40:06,984
[SPEAKER_07]: David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

1889
02:40:07,004 --> 02:40:17,497
[SPEAKER_07]: My question to Councilor Knight is, does this also include, in the initial part of it, when they actually put the bid out, they usually put in a labor amount.

1890
02:40:17,837 --> 02:40:20,220
[SPEAKER_07]: That labor amount could be ballooned.

1891
02:40:21,441 --> 02:40:39,794
[SPEAKER_07]: In the respect of an hourly versus an hourly wage, so it I'm not sure if a contractor city contract is the same But in general contracts when contractors come out and they do work The labor amount is based off of what they're charging for a labor amount some some places could charge 45 some places could charge 75 Some places could charge $80 per hour.

1892
02:40:40,214 --> 02:40:44,958
[SPEAKER_07]: It's irrelevant to actually what they're paying the employees Does that also encompass that?

1893
02:40:45,473 --> 02:40:49,756
[SPEAKER_15]: The Wage Theft Act just ensures compliance with the existing wage and hour laws.

1894
02:40:50,457 --> 02:41:14,295
[SPEAKER_15]: And it requires the applicant for the public bid to make certain disclosures to the community so that if in fact they are found in violation, then they have to take certain steps to ensure that if a complaint is brought forward to them, that they have bonded funds that are available to cover the payroll if in fact they have funneled or diverted this money from the worker and into the coffers of the business.

1895
02:41:14,595 --> 02:41:18,796
[SPEAKER_15]: So it doesn't really necessarily speak to the actual total amount of the bid.

1896
02:41:18,836 --> 02:41:29,399
[SPEAKER_15]: What it does is say if you have seven people that are designated as a municipal street sweeper, you need to pay the municipal street sweeper rate of $37 an hour for the hours that they work on the contract.

1897
02:41:29,519 --> 02:41:33,040
[SPEAKER_15]: And you're gonna work the contract for this many hours, so that's the rate that you have to pay them.

1898
02:41:33,520 --> 02:41:38,401
[SPEAKER_15]: And the rate's established by state law, by the Department of Land and Insurance.

1899
02:41:38,421 --> 02:41:40,162
[SPEAKER_07]: So that protects the actual employee.

1900
02:41:40,282 --> 02:41:41,682
[SPEAKER_07]: That protects the employee from having to wait.

1901
02:41:41,742 --> 02:41:43,743
[SPEAKER_07]: It does not protect the city from a ballooned rate.

1902
02:41:44,343 --> 02:41:47,605
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the rates are established through the Department of Labor and Industries based upon the region that you're in.

1903
02:41:47,625 --> 02:41:48,205
[SPEAKER_07]: For the employees.

1904
02:41:48,225 --> 02:41:48,546
[SPEAKER_07]: For the workers.

1905
02:41:48,566 --> 02:41:49,806
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about the actual bid itself.

1906
02:41:49,826 --> 02:41:51,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the bid process is the... There's nothing in there that would actually help.

1907
02:41:52,028 --> 02:42:02,774
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, the public bid laws are relatively specific, and the city's ability to go and put restrictions in that would exceed the requirements that are established by state or federal law is not available to us.

1908
02:42:02,834 --> 02:42:03,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, that's what I understand.

1909
02:42:03,955 --> 02:42:04,075
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1910
02:42:04,095 --> 02:42:11,460
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, so in other words, we couldn't come in and say, you cannot go any further than 15% above the actual rate that you're paying per employee.

1911
02:42:12,520 --> 02:42:18,585
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically that's where the companies would actually take the additional amounts and funds as opposed to the areas.

1912
02:42:18,845 --> 02:42:31,073
[SPEAKER_15]: Or say you work a 40 hour work week, but you really worked a 60 hour work week and they paid you 40 hours at straight time and then the 20 hours under the table.

1913
02:42:31,093 --> 02:42:40,300
[SPEAKER_15]: Or say that you worked a 40 hour work week, a straight 40 hour work week and they only paid you at your previous rate from the job that you were working on a public work project and that rate is

1914
02:42:41,233 --> 02:42:44,175
[SPEAKER_15]: 50% less than what you should be making when you're working on the public work project.

1915
02:42:45,256 --> 02:42:54,161
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that that's some of the ‑‑ it's really an effort and attempt to get some of these unsavory contractors that do business in municipalities out.

1916
02:42:54,221 --> 02:42:56,563
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess the reason why I make that point is because if they're being

1917
02:42:57,403 --> 02:43:10,275
[SPEAKER_07]: enforced, which is great, and it's an absolutely important point, then the contractor themselves will find their way to make their money anyway, and that's kind of where they're going to find their way, is the labor ballooning actually in the first part.

1918
02:43:10,315 --> 02:43:14,038
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the thing that they like to say in the industry, which would be called the change order, I believe they call it.

1919
02:43:14,078 --> 02:43:18,122
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's a code for more money.

1920
02:43:19,343 --> 02:43:19,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1921
02:43:20,669 --> 02:43:21,069
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

1922
02:43:21,390 --> 02:43:24,934
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

1923
02:43:24,974 --> 02:43:25,654
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

1924
02:43:25,794 --> 02:43:25,915
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

1925
02:43:26,035 --> 02:43:26,976
[SPEAKER_26]: Suspension of the rules.

1926
02:43:26,996 --> 02:43:29,739
[SPEAKER_26]: Suspension of the rules by Councilor Alango-Kern.

1927
02:43:29,819 --> 02:43:31,360
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to allow a citizen to speak.

1928
02:43:31,380 --> 02:43:35,024
[SPEAKER_24]: Opposed, Mr. President?

1929
02:43:36,305 --> 02:43:36,646
[SPEAKER_26]: Second.

1930
02:43:37,927 --> 02:43:38,368
[SPEAKER_26]: Do noted.

1931
02:43:39,789 --> 02:43:40,850
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address of the record, please.

1932
02:43:43,223 --> 02:43:54,548
[SPEAKER_23]: First of all, I want to say thank you to all of you, and I know it's been a long evening, so I will not try to take up too much of your time.

1933
02:43:55,269 --> 02:43:58,871
[SPEAKER_23]: But I did want to address the councils.

1934
02:44:00,711 --> 02:44:05,594
[SPEAKER_23]: On Friday, August 11, the incumbents and the candidates for the Medford City Council were invited to

1935
02:44:06,494 --> 02:44:28,897
[SPEAKER_23]: present or be present to witness the city clerk and three members of the Registrars of Voters Department draw the names of the primary election ballot to be held on September 12 while we were all together all Candidates had agreed and signed a letter addressed to the City Council to the attention of President Caraviello to place our request on tonight's agenda and

1936
02:44:29,998 --> 02:44:35,383
[SPEAKER_23]: We are proposing with the city council's approval to waive the primary and request a homeroom petition.

1937
02:44:36,104 --> 02:44:48,355
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm here to state that yes, we all have the right to the democratic process, but in this particular situation, I believe the money spent for a primary can be utilized in a much more productive manner.

1938
02:44:49,176 --> 02:44:52,959
[SPEAKER_23]: There is one additional person on the ballot that requires the city to have a primary.

1939
02:44:53,759 --> 02:45:01,405
[SPEAKER_23]: What amplifies the democratic process more than for all candidates to have equal opportunity on the day of the election?

1940
02:45:02,732 --> 02:45:05,955
[SPEAKER_23]: A primary will cost anywhere between $35,000 and $45,000.

1941
02:45:06,275 --> 02:45:12,659
[SPEAKER_23]: And I, for one, do not want to add additional expenses onto our taxpayers.

1942
02:45:13,260 --> 02:45:18,324
[SPEAKER_23]: For those who believe the money has been allocated for the primary, then why not utilize

1943
02:45:19,474 --> 02:45:27,398
[SPEAKER_23]: in different areas, such as education, public safety, drug prevention programs, or simply towards the maintenance of our streets.

1944
02:45:28,098 --> 02:45:42,784
[SPEAKER_23]: I am here to be on record with full disclosure and transparency as a candidate of the Medford City Council and a resident of this city to respectfully request the Medford City Council vote on waiving the primary and submitting the request of our home rule petition.

1945
02:45:45,185 --> 02:45:46,806
[SPEAKER_23]: I do have the letter.

1946
02:45:46,826 --> 02:45:48,767
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not sure if you are all aware.

1947
02:45:50,019 --> 02:45:57,206
[SPEAKER_23]: I do have a copy of the letter that was signed by all eight candidates, and I'll be more than happy to give it to all of you.

1948
02:45:57,226 --> 02:45:59,708
[SPEAKER_25]: I think I think I think they all have it.

1949
02:46:00,508 --> 02:46:01,589
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you all have a copy of this?

1950
02:46:01,850 --> 02:46:04,072
[SPEAKER_25]: It should go out the packet this week.

1951
02:46:04,612 --> 02:46:09,316
[SPEAKER_23]: This should be there.

1952
02:46:09,757 --> 02:46:10,618
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. President, if I may.

1953
02:46:12,319 --> 02:46:15,882
[SPEAKER_16]: I guess the question that I have, I guess the question that I have is the president is

1954
02:46:17,266 --> 02:46:22,056
[SPEAKER_16]: this letter that has been signed do all eight candidates still stand in support of it?

1955
02:46:27,567 --> 02:46:34,051
[SPEAKER_26]: I put the motion on with the agreement that all eight candidates supported.

1956
02:46:34,731 --> 02:46:44,316
[SPEAKER_26]: One candidate notified me on Saturday that they did not want to continue on it, which prompted me to withdraw the motion.

1957
02:46:44,636 --> 02:46:45,056
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll share.

1958
02:46:45,736 --> 02:46:46,057
We'll share.

1959
02:46:46,677 --> 02:46:48,898
[SPEAKER_16]: Would you be willing to disclose, Mr. President, which candidate?

1960
02:46:48,978 --> 02:46:49,398
[SPEAKER_16]: I will not.

1961
02:46:51,643 --> 02:46:52,664
[SPEAKER_16]: We know it wasn't Ms.

1962
02:46:52,704 --> 02:46:52,964
[SPEAKER_23]: Conyo.

1963
02:46:53,044 --> 02:46:53,625
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't Ms.

1964
02:46:53,685 --> 02:46:54,306
[SPEAKER_23]: Conyo, no.

1965
02:46:54,546 --> 02:46:58,670
[SPEAKER_23]: And for the record, if there were eight candidates, I guess I have a question.

1966
02:46:59,150 --> 02:47:10,742
[SPEAKER_23]: If there were all eight candidates that had signed that letter, then I think we all had the respect to know who had decided to withdraw because everyone has the right to make their own decision.

1967
02:47:11,082 --> 02:47:15,586
[SPEAKER_23]: That decision was not made by me, and I believe I have two other candidates here.

1968
02:47:16,387 --> 02:47:18,549
[SPEAKER_23]: that the decision was not made by them.

1969
02:47:19,190 --> 02:47:25,836
[SPEAKER_23]: And for the record, we do have a letter with our signatures on it that still are saying we would like to waive it.

1970
02:47:25,956 --> 02:47:36,766
[SPEAKER_23]: And again, if we're going to give everyone the respect that they decided to change their mind, then I ask this committee to give me the same respect of not changing my mind.

1971
02:47:39,980 --> 02:47:46,506
[SPEAKER_23]: And I also have the letter with the three of us who had decided or we never changed our minds.

1972
02:47:47,807 --> 02:47:49,228
[SPEAKER_20]: Point of order, Mr. President.

1973
02:47:49,848 --> 02:47:51,169
[SPEAKER_26]: Point of order, Councilor Del Rosario.

1974
02:47:57,066 --> 02:47:59,367
[SPEAKER_26]: Mrs. Cuno, the matter has been disposed of.

1975
02:47:59,687 --> 02:48:09,969
[SPEAKER_23]: And again, I just want to be on record because it was assumed that I was part and the other two members of the candidates that were running were part of that decision.

1976
02:48:10,369 --> 02:48:12,249
[SPEAKER_23]: We were not the part of that decision.

1977
02:48:13,230 --> 02:48:14,650
[SPEAKER_23]: It had never been discussed with us.

1978
02:48:15,050 --> 02:48:17,391
[SPEAKER_23]: It had only been discussed to waive the primary.

1979
02:48:17,791 --> 02:48:24,052
[SPEAKER_23]: So as I know, with all due respect, I understand that you've made your decisions, but I also want it very clear

1980
02:48:24,592 --> 02:48:27,576
[SPEAKER_23]: And on record that I was not for a primary.

1981
02:48:28,056 --> 02:48:28,356
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1982
02:48:28,477 --> 02:48:30,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President.

1983
02:48:30,919 --> 02:48:39,489
[SPEAKER_15]: The issue of a primary election has been something that's been heard in rumblings and rumors around the city as to whether or not we should have it, whether or not there are going to be enough candidates to have it, so on and so forth.

1984
02:48:40,029 --> 02:48:42,051
[SPEAKER_15]: And the idea of waiving the primary

1985
02:48:43,305 --> 02:48:44,606
[SPEAKER_15]: It can make sense, it makes sense.

1986
02:48:45,646 --> 02:48:50,429
[SPEAKER_15]: It certainly makes sense to save money, but then we also have to think philosophically about the way government works.

1987
02:48:51,309 --> 02:48:55,311
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to think a little bit more about what dictates why a primary election is supposed to occur.

1988
02:48:56,352 --> 02:49:05,136
[SPEAKER_15]: I, for one, came forward and stood with several of my colleagues against a home rule petition to change our charter.

1989
02:49:05,997 --> 02:49:09,919
[SPEAKER_15]: I stood with my colleagues and I said, I think that this is something that the voters should address.

1990
02:49:10,059 --> 02:49:12,440
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now we have a charter that dictates the way our election should work.

1991
02:49:13,082 --> 02:49:21,155
[SPEAKER_15]: If we're going to change that document, that that document should be done by the initiative petition process and should be done from the ground up based upon the will of the voters.

1992
02:49:22,122 --> 02:49:37,285
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd have a very difficult time this evening supporting a paper that would waive the requirements of a primary election because the primary election is dictated and outlined in the charter of our community, the document, the blueprint, the constitution of how we're supposed to run our government.

1993
02:49:37,305 --> 02:49:39,105
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd have a very difficult time waiving the primary.

1994
02:49:40,006 --> 02:49:46,347
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess it's a moot point at this point because Councilor Caraviello has withdrawn the paper and there's no paper that's before the council this evening addressing that issue.

1995
02:49:47,467 --> 02:49:51,388
[SPEAKER_15]: However, I can certainly see the benefits of it and the financial

1996
02:49:54,210 --> 02:50:01,396
[SPEAKER_15]: However, the question comes as to what's more important, process or the funds?

1997
02:50:02,096 --> 02:50:07,581
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would have a very difficult time if this paper was still on the ground today to vote to waive the primary election, Mr. President.

1998
02:50:09,524 --> 02:50:10,685
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address of the record, please.

1999
02:50:11,085 --> 02:50:12,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2000
02:50:12,125 --> 02:50:14,006
[SPEAKER_09]: Robert Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

2001
02:50:15,587 --> 02:50:25,593
[SPEAKER_09]: I was one of several candidates who reconsidered this letter that we signed on Friday during the day of the lottery, a letter

2002
02:50:26,153 --> 02:50:27,813
[SPEAKER_09]: that was just hastily written.

2003
02:50:28,234 --> 02:50:29,274
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't notarized.

2004
02:50:29,634 --> 02:50:34,495
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't written under perjury or penalty going back on it.

2005
02:50:35,555 --> 02:50:44,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Considering the costs, I mean, I've been coming to these city council meetings for 10 years and I've been asking for costs to be redirected.

2006
02:50:44,858 --> 02:50:51,419
[SPEAKER_09]: And these are monies that are gonna be allocated and spent elsewhere, whether it's on the primary or not.

2007
02:50:51,799 --> 02:50:53,880
[SPEAKER_09]: The money essentially is already gone.

2008
02:50:54,866 --> 02:50:55,947
[SPEAKER_09]: Essentially, it's already gone.

2009
02:50:56,388 --> 02:50:59,151
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't the only candidate who reconsidered.

2010
02:50:59,332 --> 02:51:05,699
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want it to be presented tonight that just one person, because we... I was only notified by one person.

2011
02:51:05,940 --> 02:51:06,560
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

2012
02:51:06,680 --> 02:51:08,362
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know who else.

2013
02:51:08,483 --> 02:51:11,426
[SPEAKER_09]: And here we are tonight, notifying you, Mr. President.

2014
02:51:12,577 --> 02:51:15,400
[SPEAKER_09]: on after discussion from some of the candidates.

2015
02:51:16,081 --> 02:51:20,085
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't hidden from other people who signed.

2016
02:51:21,566 --> 02:51:23,028
[SPEAKER_09]: It was presented that way.

2017
02:51:23,488 --> 02:51:29,935
[SPEAKER_09]: But with all due respect, the prior speaker was texted on Saturday and informed.

2018
02:51:30,556 --> 02:51:31,597
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know.

2019
02:51:31,997 --> 02:51:32,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

2020
02:51:33,218 --> 02:51:41,024
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying it in full disclosure because I don't want it to be portrayed or perceived that anything was covertly done.

2021
02:51:42,826 --> 02:51:54,215
[SPEAKER_09]: In considering not having a primary, I mean, the weight of denying citizens an election is something, you know,

2022
02:51:55,756 --> 02:51:57,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Something that weighed heavy on my mind.

2023
02:51:57,678 --> 02:52:00,342
[SPEAKER_09]: So I thought about it and I reconsidered speaking for myself.

2024
02:52:01,403 --> 02:52:07,209
[SPEAKER_09]: I am not obligated to to have to disclose reasons

2025
02:52:08,472 --> 02:52:10,933
[SPEAKER_09]: why I reconsidered are two people.

2026
02:52:11,513 --> 02:52:14,094
[SPEAKER_09]: I am 47 years old.

2027
02:52:14,154 --> 02:52:14,774
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm an adult.

2028
02:52:14,854 --> 02:52:16,134
[SPEAKER_09]: I can make my own decisions.

2029
02:52:16,294 --> 02:52:24,656
[SPEAKER_09]: I reconsidered based on discussion with a sitting council member, as a matter of fact, and I won't mention any names.

2030
02:52:24,676 --> 02:52:37,000
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll just say that it made better sense and it was better judgment and it was better part of the democratic process to have an election and let the voters decide and

2031
02:52:38,540 --> 02:52:43,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Full disclosure, I'm just up here tonight letting you know that everything was above board.

2032
02:52:44,022 --> 02:52:44,923
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a simple thing.

2033
02:52:45,943 --> 02:52:52,846
[SPEAKER_09]: I greatly respect you for bringing that home rule petition.

2034
02:52:53,186 --> 02:52:57,468
[SPEAKER_26]: And I think I explained to everybody on Friday what signing that meant.

2035
02:52:58,168 --> 02:52:58,348
[SPEAKER_26]: Right.

2036
02:52:59,649 --> 02:53:04,451
[SPEAKER_09]: And I understand that, but things happen and people change their mind.

2037
02:53:04,471 --> 02:53:05,451
[SPEAKER_09]: People change their mind all the time.

2038
02:53:05,491 --> 02:53:05,951
[SPEAKER_09]: It's non-binding.

2039
02:53:07,832 --> 02:53:08,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

2040
02:53:08,112 --> 02:53:10,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Your mind changed as well at times.

2041
02:53:11,575 --> 02:53:16,179
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think we should deny an election to the citizens of Medford in a primary.

2042
02:53:16,239 --> 02:53:17,520
[SPEAKER_26]: And there will be no denying of anybody.

2043
02:53:18,281 --> 02:53:19,322
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2044
02:53:23,705 --> 02:53:24,866
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address of the record, please.

2045
02:53:27,408 --> 02:53:28,850
[SPEAKER_28]: Ray Scalf on 9th, Sunset Ave.

2046
02:53:29,941 --> 02:53:34,705
[SPEAKER_28]: I just want to bring the timeline in to everybody that was notified back and forth.

2047
02:53:35,346 --> 02:53:41,050
[SPEAKER_28]: So I was the person that brought forward to all the other seven candidates about not having a primary.

2048
02:53:42,051 --> 02:53:54,201
[SPEAKER_28]: With the direction of the Council President Rick Caraviello, I contacted all of the seven candidates on the matter, on the cost to eliminate one candidate for a primary election.

2049
02:53:55,362 --> 02:54:03,765
[SPEAKER_28]: Because of that thought process, all candidates agreed to sign a statement on Friday, August 11, to not have a primary.

2050
02:54:05,726 --> 02:54:16,009
[SPEAKER_28]: On Saturday, August 12, President Caraviello called me and said he spoke to one of the new candidates who reconsidered his position wanting to have a primary.

2051
02:54:17,190 --> 02:54:23,932
[SPEAKER_28]: Because of that conversation, President Caraviello told me he was withdrawing the home rule petition to cancel the city council primary.

2052
02:54:25,460 --> 02:54:32,406
[SPEAKER_28]: I then proceeded to text all the new candidates about President Caraviello's to withdraw the motion of the Home Rule petition.

2053
02:54:33,767 --> 02:54:42,414
[SPEAKER_28]: On Monday morning, President Caraviello informed me at the coffee shop he was not going to withdraw the motion of the Home Rule petition.

2054
02:54:43,956 --> 02:54:53,503
[SPEAKER_28]: I then proceeded to inform again all seven candidates that Council President changed his mind and not to withdraw the Home Rule petition.

2055
02:54:54,816 --> 02:54:55,496
[SPEAKER_28]: Getting confusing?

2056
02:54:57,537 --> 02:55:08,103
[SPEAKER_28]: I asked all candidates if they would be willing to sign a document saying they wish to have a primary and to respond to me as soon as possible.

2057
02:55:08,123 --> 02:55:23,671
[SPEAKER_28]: I myself, having given considerable thought and receiving feedback from other candidates, along with some citizens, feel that the citizens have the right to have an election and to follow the process.

2058
02:55:25,783 --> 02:55:43,875
[SPEAKER_28]: And as Councilor Knight said, as I remember two years ago, there was an issue on a charter review and certain Councilor, Councilor Knight, made a statement that the citizens that wanted a charter review should follow the process and not send it to the state legislatures.

2059
02:55:45,736 --> 02:55:49,639
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, who am I to stop that process on challenging a primary?

2060
02:55:51,243 --> 02:55:55,805
[SPEAKER_28]: There were men and women who have served and died to give us that right to a fair election.

2061
02:55:56,786 --> 02:56:05,329
[SPEAKER_28]: I had a cousin who died at the Battle of the Bulge, and an uncle who received the Bronze Star and Purple Heart in World War II, and me, who served seven years in the military.

2062
02:56:06,710 --> 02:56:14,974
[SPEAKER_28]: After listening to fellow veterans along with concerned citizens, I don't want to see that right given away and demean their memory.

2063
02:56:15,937 --> 02:56:21,320
[SPEAKER_28]: We also discussed the cost of our last primary two years ago for city council to eliminate one candidate.

2064
02:56:22,261 --> 02:56:24,002
[SPEAKER_28]: That process of election went forward.

2065
02:56:26,803 --> 02:56:29,665
[SPEAKER_28]: This year's cost, would it really be a savings?

2066
02:56:30,505 --> 02:56:36,789
[SPEAKER_28]: It would be just to move the money to the general fund or the free cash account spent elsewhere.

2067
02:56:37,109 --> 02:56:38,570
[SPEAKER_28]: It wasn't gonna be earmarked for anywhere.

2068
02:56:38,590 --> 02:56:40,511
[SPEAKER_28]: They could spend it anywhere they wanted to.

2069
02:56:42,535 --> 02:56:45,656
[SPEAKER_28]: Personally, I would not like to see the primary canceled.

2070
02:56:46,396 --> 02:56:48,956
[SPEAKER_28]: I believe in the right to have a fair election.

2071
02:56:49,996 --> 02:56:52,897
[SPEAKER_28]: That was given to us by the men and women that fought for us.

2072
02:56:54,757 --> 02:57:01,439
[SPEAKER_28]: And I do have four names signed on a notary.

2073
02:57:01,899 --> 02:57:04,359
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a move point anyway.

2074
02:57:04,419 --> 02:57:07,300
[SPEAKER_28]: I know it's a move point, but we do have four names that did

2075
02:57:09,146 --> 02:57:16,233
[SPEAKER_28]: We don't need them.

2076
02:57:16,313 --> 02:57:16,673
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

2077
02:57:16,693 --> 02:57:17,674
[SPEAKER_26]: The matter has been disposed of.

2078
02:57:17,694 --> 02:57:19,516
[SPEAKER_28]: I just wanted to make the record straight.

2079
02:57:19,856 --> 02:57:20,297
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

2080
02:57:20,957 --> 02:57:21,658
[SPEAKER_27]: Mr. President?

2081
02:57:22,299 --> 02:57:22,679
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2082
02:57:23,720 --> 02:57:24,321
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Mox.

2083
02:57:25,261 --> 02:57:29,022
[SPEAKER_27]: Just if I could, Mr. President, because there's been a lot of discussion around this issue.

2084
02:57:29,782 --> 02:57:47,968
[SPEAKER_27]: And I can tell you firsthand that, in my opinion, when we talk about conflicts of interest, about having a vested interest in something, and how we as a legislative body should remove ourselves, I have a real problem with elected officials canceling elections.

2085
02:57:48,468 --> 02:57:49,708
[SPEAKER_27]: I have a real problem with that.

2086
02:57:50,108 --> 02:57:53,049
[SPEAKER_27]: I think that's probably one of the most unethical things that

2087
02:57:56,348 --> 02:58:02,911
[SPEAKER_27]: uh, honest with you, and to also do it in the name of savings, to me, is just a smokescreen.

2088
02:58:03,411 --> 02:58:05,232
[SPEAKER_27]: Because first of all, there is no savings.

2089
02:58:05,832 --> 02:58:17,438
[SPEAKER_27]: And secondly, Mr. President, when you look at the budget, and if you want to make a savings, the tax pays and the rate pays in this community have been paying for peg access, which they haven't had for four years.

2090
02:58:18,043 --> 02:58:20,305
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not the way you save in a $160 million budget.

2091
02:58:42,035 --> 02:58:49,461
[SPEAKER_27]: and even non incumbents and incumbents have a vested interest in the process, we should be involved whether or not an election is canceled.

2092
02:58:49,922 --> 02:58:52,804
[SPEAKER_27]: And our city charter dictates what should happen.

2093
02:58:53,365 --> 02:58:56,127
[SPEAKER_27]: Double the office plus one, you have a primary.

2094
02:58:57,809 --> 02:59:00,091
[SPEAKER_27]: Now we're trying to circumvent the process.

2095
02:59:00,411 --> 02:59:07,317
[SPEAKER_27]: No matter how you cut it up, we're trying to circumvent the process of allowing residents of this community to get out and vote.

2096
02:59:07,757 --> 02:59:09,499
[SPEAKER_27]: Now I realize a primary election

2097
02:59:09,878 --> 02:59:13,159
[SPEAKER_27]: from previous elections, probably 10 to 12 percent turnout.

2098
02:59:13,780 --> 02:59:15,481
[SPEAKER_27]: And I know that's probably around 4,000 voters.

2099
02:59:15,501 --> 02:59:17,481
[SPEAKER_27]: And that is a lower turnout.

2100
02:59:17,822 --> 02:59:23,764
[SPEAKER_27]: But how do you say to 4,000 voters, sorry, we don't believe that this primary is important enough?

2101
02:59:24,345 --> 02:59:27,546
[SPEAKER_27]: We don't believe your right to get out and vote is important enough.

2102
02:59:28,747 --> 02:59:30,487
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't understand that, Mr. President.

2103
02:59:30,527 --> 02:59:31,688
[SPEAKER_27]: I really can't fathom that.

2104
02:59:32,068 --> 02:59:36,070
[SPEAKER_27]: And, you know, EFDE here, why are the city turnouts so low?

2105
02:59:36,696 --> 02:59:37,197
[SPEAKER_27]: You know why?

2106
02:59:37,557 --> 02:59:49,471
[SPEAKER_27]: Because of these things, these type of things, Mr. President, when we have low turnout and we want to gather interest in the community, and the quickest way to put a fizzle on that is to do away with elections.

2107
02:59:49,871 --> 02:59:50,332
[SPEAKER_27]: Think about it.

2108
02:59:51,212 --> 02:59:53,173
[SPEAKER_27]: We're trying to build up elections in this community.

2109
02:59:53,433 --> 03:00:00,716
[SPEAKER_27]: This council has asked to promote elections by putting banners out and A-frame signs and other social media to get elections out.

2110
03:00:01,116 --> 03:00:03,397
[SPEAKER_27]: And here we are saying, that's canceled the election.

2111
03:00:04,017 --> 03:00:06,618
[SPEAKER_27]: It just doesn't make any sense to me, Mr. President.

2112
03:00:06,978 --> 03:00:08,018
[SPEAKER_27]: It's not a savings.

2113
03:00:08,398 --> 03:00:09,899
[SPEAKER_27]: That's a red herring.

2114
03:00:10,880 --> 03:00:16,627
[SPEAKER_27]: This is all about, Mr. President, about affording the right to people in this community to get out and vote.

2115
03:00:16,927 --> 03:00:22,254
[SPEAKER_27]: And even if it's just one person that wants to get out, Mr. President, I'm going to support their right to get out and vote.

2116
03:00:22,434 --> 03:00:24,056
[SPEAKER_26]: There is no motion on the floor, Mr. Vice President.

2117
03:00:24,076 --> 03:00:29,303
[SPEAKER_27]: I know there's not, but there's been a lot of discussion around this, and I want to let people know where I stand on this, Mr. President.

2118
03:00:29,765 --> 03:00:30,126
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2119
03:00:31,067 --> 03:00:32,129
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address of the record, please.

2120
03:00:32,530 --> 03:00:34,353
[SPEAKER_23]: Ann Marie Cuno, 871 Felsway.

2121
03:00:35,275 --> 03:00:38,180
[SPEAKER_23]: I came here a little while ago and I stated what I stated.

2122
03:00:38,200 --> 03:00:42,547
[SPEAKER_23]: I am not saying that we shouldn't have an election and I am not saying that we do not.

2123
03:00:43,827 --> 03:00:47,449
[SPEAKER_23]: everyone has the right and deserves the right for an election.

2124
03:00:48,189 --> 03:00:54,232
[SPEAKER_23]: What I had said was, is that when we were together on Friday, that was the discussion that we had had.

2125
03:00:54,792 --> 03:01:01,375
[SPEAKER_23]: And I know that other people have come up here and said that they've spoken to other people and they've spoken to all of us, and that's fine.

2126
03:01:02,095 --> 03:01:04,359
[SPEAKER_23]: I, on the record, have not received a text message.

2127
03:01:04,819 --> 03:01:05,941
[SPEAKER_23]: I have my phone with me.

2128
03:01:06,282 --> 03:01:07,744
[SPEAKER_23]: I didn't receive a text message.

2129
03:01:08,104 --> 03:01:16,297
[SPEAKER_23]: The only reason I was coming up was just to make it very clear that the discussion that happened between Friday

2130
03:01:17,258 --> 03:01:26,343
[SPEAKER_23]: And I guess Sunday, when you were all at the coffee shop, is that I was not part of it, and I believe that there were two other members that really weren't part of it.

2131
03:01:26,803 --> 03:01:28,204
[SPEAKER_23]: But that is for them to say.

2132
03:01:28,604 --> 03:01:30,946
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not trying to eliminate the due process.

2133
03:01:31,266 --> 03:01:33,787
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm not trying to take anyone's rights away.

2134
03:01:34,127 --> 03:01:38,630
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm just trying to be, it's funny, people say we have to be transparent.

2135
03:01:39,862 --> 03:01:42,284
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm just saying I was not informed of it.

2136
03:01:42,644 --> 03:01:46,466
[SPEAKER_23]: So I did not want other people to make a decision for me.

2137
03:01:46,786 --> 03:01:47,447
[SPEAKER_23]: That was it.

2138
03:01:50,268 --> 03:01:51,549
[SPEAKER_26]: There was nothing to be informed of.

2139
03:01:51,650 --> 03:01:52,230
[SPEAKER_23]: But I don't know.

2140
03:01:52,250 --> 03:01:54,993
[SPEAKER_23]: Everybody else is saying that they've texted and spoken to everybody.

2141
03:01:55,013 --> 03:01:56,274
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm just going through the question.

2142
03:01:56,314 --> 03:01:57,876
[SPEAKER_23]: Move the question, please.

2143
03:01:57,916 --> 03:01:59,778
[SPEAKER_32]: Point of order, Mr. President.

2144
03:01:59,938 --> 03:02:01,080
[SPEAKER_32]: Point of order, Mr. President.

2145
03:02:01,640 --> 03:02:04,944
[SPEAKER_26]: There's nothing to be informed of because there was nothing official.

2146
03:02:05,304 --> 03:02:08,728
[SPEAKER_26]: So again, that was an agreement amongst the eight candidates.

2147
03:02:09,108 --> 03:02:10,670
[SPEAKER_26]: So it had nothing to do with the City of Medford.

2148
03:02:11,368 --> 03:02:12,249
[SPEAKER_31]: You're absolutely right.

2149
03:02:12,389 --> 03:02:15,530
[SPEAKER_31]: But there are other people up here that said the president went to Parliament procedure.

2150
03:02:16,150 --> 03:02:17,071
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely.

2151
03:02:17,751 --> 03:02:20,613
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to make a call for the orders of the day, Mr. President.

2152
03:02:20,933 --> 03:02:25,815
[SPEAKER_15]: The paper that's the discussion that's being held before us is attached to a paper that's been disposed of already.

2153
03:02:25,835 --> 03:02:26,836
[SPEAKER_15]: The paper has been disposed of.

2154
03:02:26,876 --> 03:02:27,816
[SPEAKER_15]: Continue this discussion.

2155
03:02:27,836 --> 03:02:30,238
[SPEAKER_15]: We can do it during the public decision in the meeting.

2156
03:02:30,278 --> 03:02:31,438
[SPEAKER_15]: But we do have some agenda.

2157
03:02:31,478 --> 03:02:35,000
[SPEAKER_32]: Yes, we have to move the river back to one more person.

2158
03:02:35,360 --> 03:02:35,801
[SPEAKER_33]: Oh, sorry.

2159
03:02:36,201 --> 03:02:36,981
[SPEAKER_33]: I didn't speak at all.

2160
03:02:37,041 --> 03:02:37,902
[SPEAKER_33]: Someone twice.

2161
03:02:39,081 --> 03:02:39,861
[SPEAKER_16]: They were allowed to do that.

2162
03:02:40,522 --> 03:02:42,743
[SPEAKER_33]: Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

2163
03:02:44,044 --> 03:02:48,506
[SPEAKER_33]: Apparently the game is afoot, but I hope that this is the last thing that we're gonna have.

2164
03:02:48,546 --> 03:02:51,948
[SPEAKER_26]: The motion has been disposed of, so there is no other discussion on it.

2165
03:02:52,048 --> 03:02:53,749
[SPEAKER_33]: No, not on this side of the table.

2166
03:02:55,189 --> 03:02:56,410
[SPEAKER_33]: Let her finish, let her just, please.

2167
03:02:57,210 --> 03:02:58,451
[SPEAKER_33]: It'll be faster, yeah.

2168
03:02:58,991 --> 03:03:07,316
[SPEAKER_33]: But I just wanna say that when I was approached about not holding a primary and then about holding a primary, I insisted that all candidates be notified.

2169
03:03:08,036 --> 03:03:14,218
[SPEAKER_33]: I wasn't notified about a paper that was signed for people coming here tonight that didn't want to have a primary.

2170
03:03:14,738 --> 03:03:22,241
[SPEAKER_33]: So I just caution everyone that all the candidates, we should be working together because theoretically, we all want what's best for the city.

2171
03:03:22,641 --> 03:03:24,982
[SPEAKER_33]: So I hope that there isn't any backroom deals.

2172
03:03:25,422 --> 03:03:29,203
[SPEAKER_33]: When I was approached by candidates, I did speak to them about what's best.

2173
03:03:29,223 --> 03:03:31,644
[SPEAKER_15]: So for the record, do you want to waive the primary?

2174
03:03:33,462 --> 03:03:35,163
[SPEAKER_33]: I didn't have strong feelings about it either way.

2175
03:03:35,183 --> 03:03:39,606
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, because I'm looking at the letter and your name's on it and I just wanted to figure if that was okay.

2176
03:03:39,626 --> 03:03:40,527
[SPEAKER_15]: That was all, Mr. President.

2177
03:03:40,567 --> 03:03:47,972
[SPEAKER_33]: So I thought that everybody put forth solid arguments about it and we're going to have an agreement amongst your eight candidates.

2178
03:03:48,693 --> 03:03:49,153
[SPEAKER_33]: Exactly.

2179
03:03:49,173 --> 03:03:49,494
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2180
03:03:54,237 --> 03:03:56,599
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. President, a motion to revert back to the regular business.

2181
03:03:56,639 --> 03:03:57,239
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor.

2182
03:04:03,705 --> 03:04:14,570
[SPEAKER_26]: Name and address of the record, please.

2183
03:04:15,251 --> 03:04:19,633
[SPEAKER_34]: Andrew Paul Castagnetti, 23 Cushion Street, Method, Massachusetts.

2184
03:04:19,653 --> 03:04:21,654
[SPEAKER_06]: My phone number is 781396-TIPS, T-I-P-S.

2185
03:04:27,675 --> 03:04:34,919
[SPEAKER_34]: If I may try to put this in proper perspective for if there's ever a viewing public of this meeting in the future.

2186
03:04:35,899 --> 03:04:38,060
[SPEAKER_34]: I believe the formula is, because it is confusing.

2187
03:04:38,080 --> 03:04:40,542
[SPEAKER_26]: This meeting is being taped live, is live.

2188
03:04:40,842 --> 03:04:41,162
[SPEAKER_26]: It's live.

2189
03:04:41,182 --> 03:04:42,223
[SPEAKER_26]: It's on television right now.

2190
03:04:43,383 --> 03:04:44,124
[SPEAKER_34]: Okay, thank you.

2191
03:04:44,144 --> 03:04:44,944
[SPEAKER_34]: Excuse my appearance.

2192
03:04:44,984 --> 03:04:48,206
[SPEAKER_34]: I had a bad injury at the bike path that doesn't exist in the Mystic River.

2193
03:04:51,857 --> 03:05:00,402
[SPEAKER_34]: The formula for a primary, I believe, is seven positions for the city council, which you all hold, times two is 14, add one is 15.

2194
03:05:00,622 --> 03:05:12,709
[SPEAKER_34]: If there's 15 or more candidates running, and there are, I believe, triggers a primary according to the city ordinance or charter.

2195
03:05:13,370 --> 03:05:14,010
[SPEAKER_34]: Is that accurate?

2196
03:05:14,110 --> 03:05:14,710
[SPEAKER_34]: That is correct.

2197
03:05:14,991 --> 03:05:15,491
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, sir.

2198
03:05:21,011 --> 03:05:28,777
[SPEAKER_34]: I on on when when Mr. City Clerk Finn had the drawing for the post positions.

2199
03:05:31,579 --> 03:05:40,566
[SPEAKER_34]: I did sign as a council candidate for this election, a so called document.

2200
03:05:41,487 --> 03:05:45,570
[SPEAKER_34]: I believe all eight of us signed it of the challenges I should say.

2201
03:05:47,716 --> 03:05:51,257
[SPEAKER_34]: And that's the only document I ever signed to that nature.

2202
03:05:51,718 --> 03:06:00,621
[SPEAKER_34]: And the document was stating, I believe, to let's waive the primary and save the taxpayers $30,000, $45,000.

2203
03:06:01,402 --> 03:06:03,062
[SPEAKER_34]: I hear sometimes $70,000.

2204
03:06:04,383 --> 03:06:06,364
[SPEAKER_34]: I don't know what the actual figure is.

2205
03:06:07,984 --> 03:06:11,206
[SPEAKER_34]: So I said, sure, it makes sense to me, common sense.

2206
03:06:12,452 --> 03:06:18,493
[SPEAKER_34]: that why spend $30,000 to $45,000 to eliminate one out of the 15?

2207
03:06:19,773 --> 03:06:26,595
[SPEAKER_34]: And God forbid someone gets eliminated, if there is a primary, that person's not going to feel very happy, I presume.

2208
03:06:28,915 --> 03:06:32,336
[SPEAKER_34]: It seems like a lot of big chunk of cash to eliminate one person.

2209
03:06:33,876 --> 03:06:39,497
[SPEAKER_34]: However, if you put it in perspective, as Councilor Marks was alluding to,

2210
03:06:42,551 --> 03:06:59,061
[SPEAKER_34]: 45,000, when this city spent, first of all, they collected from our pockets, the taxpayers, a billion dollars, over a billion dollars, not including the bonds they borrowed and extended our debt, the public debt.

2211
03:06:59,942 --> 03:07:04,985
[SPEAKER_34]: And from real perspective, I believe the 45,000,

2212
03:07:07,578 --> 03:07:16,422
[SPEAKER_34]: is two hundredths of 1% of this year's $167 million budget.

2213
03:07:17,983 --> 03:07:24,567
[SPEAKER_34]: Furthermore, bottom line, this might be the best $45,000 this city has ever spent in 55 years.

2214
03:07:26,347 --> 03:07:28,749
[SPEAKER_34]: It's going to open up some conversation, I would think.

2215
03:07:29,089 --> 03:07:29,409
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

2216
03:07:29,889 --> 03:07:30,470
[SPEAKER_34]: You're welcome.

2217
03:07:30,570 --> 03:07:31,190
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm not finished.

2218
03:07:33,987 --> 03:07:48,696
[SPEAKER_34]: And maybe we can get some leadership that can improve our situation in the city and lower our real estate taxes, et cetera, et cetera, and improve the quality of life.

2219
03:07:49,556 --> 03:07:57,521
[SPEAKER_34]: So frankly, Charlotte, have the primary, don't have the primary, it might be a good thing to spend that $45,000 after all.

2220
03:07:57,561 --> 03:07:57,921
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

2221
03:07:58,301 --> 03:07:59,122
[SPEAKER_34]: You're quite welcome, sir.

2222
03:08:00,654 --> 03:08:02,135
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion to revert back to regular business.

2223
03:08:02,655 --> 03:08:02,855
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2224
03:08:02,875 --> 03:08:14,681
[SPEAKER_26]: 17-599 offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn be it resolved that the Energy and Environment Office provide the City of Medford City Council with an update on test boardings behind the Andrews School and Clippership Park.

2225
03:08:15,041 --> 03:08:16,001
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

2226
03:08:16,182 --> 03:08:17,722
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

2227
03:08:17,822 --> 03:08:23,625
[SPEAKER_05]: Just wanted to reach out and hopefully get a written response from Energy and Environment, Ms.

2228
03:08:23,665 --> 03:08:23,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Hunt.

2229
03:08:24,566 --> 03:08:27,127
[SPEAKER_05]: I know she was working hard on this project and it was

2230
03:08:28,237 --> 03:08:32,040
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfortunate what was discovered on Clippership Park.

2231
03:08:32,740 --> 03:08:37,164
[SPEAKER_05]: We also as a council asked that there be test pourings done on at the Andrews School.

2232
03:08:38,385 --> 03:08:41,087
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to make sure that's one of my two reasons.

2233
03:08:41,127 --> 03:08:51,615
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously we want an update, but I want to make sure that those test pourings were done behind the Andrews School where hundreds of children play during school hours and play soccer on the weekends.

2234
03:08:51,895 --> 03:08:54,537
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just want to make sure that that soil is not contaminated.

2235
03:08:55,383 --> 03:08:57,977
[SPEAKER_05]: So I move approval on this and ask for a written response.

2236
03:08:58,400 --> 03:08:58,880
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor Knight.

2237
03:08:59,301 --> 03:09:02,723
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, I think this is a good resolution and I second the recommendation.

2238
03:09:03,683 --> 03:09:15,651
[SPEAKER_15]: Ultimately, we just this morning, I should say this morning, it feels like this morning, but a little earlier in the evening, we had a presentation by the Massachusetts Area Planning Council and our Office of Community Development concerning the master plan for Medford Square.

2239
03:09:16,211 --> 03:09:19,753
[SPEAKER_15]: And that plan focused a lot on the Clippership Connector.

2240
03:09:20,714 --> 03:09:27,738
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it's very important moving forward, since we have this draft plan for the Medford Square that they're looking at, that we understand what's going on over there environmentally.

2241
03:09:28,358 --> 03:09:34,583
[SPEAKER_15]: on the Clippership Connector because that seemed to be a major part of connectivity between the square and other parts of the city.

2242
03:09:35,604 --> 03:09:35,964
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2243
03:09:36,605 --> 03:09:39,988
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Lungo-Kearns, seconded by Councilor Knight.

2244
03:09:40,008 --> 03:09:41,169
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favour?

2245
03:09:41,309 --> 03:09:41,689
[SPEAKER_20]: Aye.

2246
03:09:41,769 --> 03:09:43,450
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

2247
03:09:43,470 --> 03:09:45,312
[SPEAKER_26]: $17,600 offered by Councilor Knight.

2248
03:09:45,332 --> 03:09:49,695
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it resolved that the DPW repair the pothole in front of 12 Golden Avenue.

2249
03:09:49,735 --> 03:09:50,316
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight.

2250
03:09:50,796 --> 03:09:54,579
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Steve Tanaglia, Brian Cairns, and the members of the Met for DPW.

2251
03:09:55,519 --> 03:10:03,945
[SPEAKER_15]: I placed a phone call and put this matter on the resolution on the council agenda, but because we're meeting sporadically over the summer, the issue was taken care of in 24 hours.

2252
03:10:04,425 --> 03:10:10,349
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I withdraw the resolution and I thank the DPW for their prompt and quick response.

2253
03:10:10,369 --> 03:10:12,110
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion by Councilor Knight to withdraw 17-600.

2254
03:10:15,597 --> 03:10:30,891
[SPEAKER_26]: 17-601 offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn be it resolved that the final fiscal year 18 budget be posted online in detail and that any candidate for office be allowed to review and receive such a copy of such.

2255
03:10:31,211 --> 03:10:32,192
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Lungo-Koehn.

2256
03:10:32,312 --> 03:10:33,693
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you President Caraviello.

2257
03:10:33,993 --> 03:10:40,339
[SPEAKER_05]: I learned about a week ago that there was a candidate for office who couldn't get the budget book for fiscal year 2018.

2258
03:10:41,844 --> 03:10:44,486
[SPEAKER_05]: which was passed and approved the end of June.

2259
03:10:45,006 --> 03:10:48,108
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was surprised.

2260
03:10:48,228 --> 03:10:58,935
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to make sure that any candidate, anybody, any person who lives in the city who wants to review the budget can do so online or go to the city clerk's office and read a hard copy.

2261
03:10:58,955 --> 03:11:05,779
[SPEAKER_05]: And any candidate should be able to, or the mayor's office, wherever that may be, to be able to review the budget in detail.

2262
03:11:05,839 --> 03:11:07,120
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's essential to,

2263
03:11:09,269 --> 03:11:25,046
[SPEAKER_05]: transparency obviously but it's just essential to know what is in that budget where the money spent it's like we just spoke about 160 plus million dollar budget and I really feel that every every candidate and resident in the city should have access to it.

2264
03:11:25,066 --> 03:11:26,508
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

2265
03:11:30,908 --> 03:11:49,412
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm under the impression that it is posted and that especially the devotees of the budget process, the citizen participants who are often there year after year to participate in the budget, receive one.

2266
03:11:50,005 --> 03:11:53,146
[SPEAKER_26]: There is a hard copy available now, if I'm not mistaken.

2267
03:11:53,326 --> 03:11:54,286
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, we got a hard copy this week.

2268
03:11:54,306 --> 03:11:55,606
[SPEAKER_26]: I don't know when it was made available.

2269
03:11:56,746 --> 03:11:57,806
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight.

2270
03:11:58,066 --> 03:12:03,547
[SPEAKER_15]: I do believe, Mr. President, the public records law would dictate the provision of public documents to individuals in the community.

2271
03:12:03,627 --> 03:12:04,428
[SPEAKER_15]: That's the state law.

2272
03:12:04,928 --> 03:12:16,270
[SPEAKER_15]: I find it nonsensical for the council to think that they can move forward and put more stringent requirements on something that's already been established by a higher governmental jurisdiction.

2273
03:12:17,110 --> 03:12:18,110
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may, through the chair,

2274
03:12:18,696 --> 03:12:28,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe the detailed budget that we were given in June with specific information, very detailed information, not all of that is online.

2275
03:12:28,671 --> 03:12:30,374
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like that should be open to the public.

2276
03:12:32,318 --> 03:12:33,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Name and address of the record, please.

2277
03:12:34,198 --> 03:12:36,019
[SPEAKER_07]: David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

2278
03:12:36,619 --> 03:12:42,960
[SPEAKER_07]: I do want to speak on this point because I was the one who was actually trying to get my hands on a budget.

2279
03:12:43,720 --> 03:12:56,903
[SPEAKER_07]: I did go in two consecutive weeks in a row to try and get my hands on a budget towards the end of July and was met with a little confusion as to why it wasn't available throughout the actual city hall itself.

2280
03:12:58,243 --> 03:13:02,984
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that the City Clerk tried really hard to figure out how I could get my hands on one.

2281
03:13:03,024 --> 03:13:10,667
[SPEAKER_07]: The City Assessor did put a little effort into it and was reverted back to the Mayor's Office to find a copy not available.

2282
03:13:10,987 --> 03:13:12,647
[SPEAKER_07]: I did ask if I could get it online.

2283
03:13:13,067 --> 03:13:13,728
[SPEAKER_07]: It was met with

2284
03:13:15,368 --> 03:13:19,171
[SPEAKER_07]: the young lady that actually tried to help me with I don't know anything about that.

2285
03:13:19,271 --> 03:13:21,732
[SPEAKER_07]: All I know is that the budget is out to print.

2286
03:13:22,093 --> 03:13:25,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, in my impression, you want to talk about transparency.

2287
03:13:25,815 --> 03:13:39,324
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have passed a budget and that budget is enacted the first week of July, every single citizen, not just candidates, every single citizen should be able to get it at any point immediately because if you're working with a budget and that budget is operating,

2288
03:13:39,744 --> 03:13:41,426
[SPEAKER_07]: that means it should be in our hands period.

2289
03:13:41,866 --> 03:13:43,267
[SPEAKER_07]: That is not transparency.

2290
03:13:43,568 --> 03:13:52,455
[SPEAKER_07]: That is not what this administration is showing in the regards of one of the most simplest documents for that reason.

2291
03:13:52,775 --> 03:14:03,525
[SPEAKER_07]: So I strongly suggest that this time next year when a budget is being presented and passed, it is ready to go July 1st because everyone should have it in their hands.

2292
03:14:03,805 --> 03:14:04,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2293
03:14:04,466 --> 03:14:04,806
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

2294
03:14:04,866 --> 03:14:05,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President.

2295
03:14:06,287 --> 03:14:07,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2296
03:14:07,988 --> 03:14:16,451
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, I too, I mean, I feel that the budget, I mean, what we do in passing the budget, reviewing the budget is one of our biggest responsibilities.

2297
03:14:17,131 --> 03:14:19,752
[SPEAKER_02]: And transparency is key when it comes to the budget.

2298
03:14:19,892 --> 03:14:21,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everyone should be

2299
03:14:22,453 --> 03:14:23,574
[SPEAKER_02]: have access to the budget.

2300
03:14:23,614 --> 03:14:24,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always felt that way.

2301
03:14:25,495 --> 03:14:31,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I think especially when you think about it, there's so much money and everything that runs, runs through the budget.

2302
03:14:32,360 --> 03:14:36,823
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we should be encouraging people to get involved with the budget process and actually taking a look at the budget.

2303
03:14:37,483 --> 03:14:39,204
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, one of the biggest

2304
03:14:40,325 --> 03:14:45,448
[SPEAKER_02]: to me a big initiative that we passed this year, and everyone's still behind, was the legislative software.

2305
03:14:46,088 --> 03:15:05,900
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a motion that I brought forward in the spring, and this council stood before it, and it's in the budget, and that is actually to make sure that the materials that we receive with legislative software, all those materials should be in that software package, so everything we get, you'll be able to see in the general public.

2306
03:15:06,450 --> 03:15:11,313
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all public information, but it's going to be easily accessible with legislative software.

2307
03:15:12,434 --> 03:15:12,955
[SPEAKER_02]: We have that.

2308
03:15:13,015 --> 03:15:13,535
[SPEAKER_02]: That's passed.

2309
03:15:13,555 --> 03:15:14,376
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in the budget.

2310
03:15:15,697 --> 03:15:21,861
[SPEAKER_02]: It hasn't gone live yet, but to me, in my opinion, I mean, the draft budget, at least, should be part.

2311
03:15:22,181 --> 03:15:24,783
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be actually online for people to look at.

2312
03:15:25,243 --> 03:15:31,326
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they come to the meeting, they can be, you know, they can look at it in advance and say, okay, this is how much we're spending here.

2313
03:15:31,366 --> 03:15:32,707
[SPEAKER_02]: They can ask good questions.

2314
03:15:32,727 --> 03:15:34,127
[SPEAKER_02]: They can be prepared at meetings.

2315
03:15:34,627 --> 03:15:38,769
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also, you know, it helps us prepare ourselves too when all this stuff is at our fingertips.

2316
03:15:38,809 --> 03:15:46,353
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I do, I've always been a big fan of making sure that, you know, the budget, it's transparent, people can see it and people can access it.

2317
03:15:46,433 --> 03:15:51,996
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to go and just get my thoughts on this process.

2318
03:15:52,016 --> 03:15:52,696
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

2319
03:15:54,055 --> 03:15:54,635
[SPEAKER_26]: approval.

2320
03:15:54,835 --> 03:15:57,757
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Longo-Curran, seconded by Councilor Falco.

2321
03:15:57,777 --> 03:15:58,437
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

2322
03:15:59,097 --> 03:15:59,217
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

2323
03:15:59,477 --> 03:16:01,398
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

2324
03:16:01,418 --> 03:16:14,624
[SPEAKER_26]: 17-602 offered by Councilor Longo-Curran be it resolved that a state delegation be contacted to reach out to MassDOT in regards to the way they are handling the Craddock Bridge cleanup and the lack of handicap accessibility.

2325
03:16:14,724 --> 03:16:16,145
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Longo-Curran.

2326
03:16:16,285 --> 03:16:18,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

2327
03:16:18,306 --> 03:16:22,348
[SPEAKER_05]: We haven't met in a few weeks, so last week I was

2328
03:16:23,302 --> 03:16:40,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I received a number of complaints with regards to the cleanup and the splash of almost cement on the business owner's facade and a number of issues with regards to potential handicap accessibility issues down in that area.

2329
03:16:40,673 --> 03:16:42,675
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's very concerning.

2330
03:16:42,815 --> 03:16:44,436
[SPEAKER_05]: I did reach out to the mayor's office.

2331
03:16:44,756 --> 03:16:50,940
[SPEAKER_05]: I know a number of us have been making calls and trying to get in touch with MassDOT.

2332
03:16:51,534 --> 03:17:03,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I know people have been calling Representative Donato, but as a council, I would like to take a vote that we ask that this cleanup be done in a better way.

2333
03:17:03,112 --> 03:17:05,216
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of the night, a restaurant or

2334
03:17:06,134 --> 03:17:18,003
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever businesses are down there, they should be able to operate with a clean, friendly environment where a wheelchair can pass through or a mother with a stroller to get into a restaurant.

2335
03:17:18,023 --> 03:17:22,986
[SPEAKER_05]: And from the pitches I've saw, I'm extremely concerned.

2336
03:17:23,126 --> 03:17:29,071
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that, unfortunately, really nobody from the administration has been down there often.

2337
03:17:29,371 --> 03:17:30,432
[SPEAKER_05]: Thankfully, our new

2338
03:17:31,272 --> 03:17:36,817
[SPEAKER_05]: commission for persons with disabilities, our new diversity director did go down this week.

2339
03:17:37,378 --> 03:17:46,666
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure he found anything not in compliance, but there was a few days last week where I saw the ruler to the door and it just

2340
03:17:47,645 --> 03:17:54,070
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very concerning, so I would ask that we, as a body, take a roll call vote to ask our state delegation to get involved.

2341
03:17:54,130 --> 03:18:03,258
[SPEAKER_26]: If I can interject, I have spoken with Representative Leader Donato, and he is in the process of arranging a meeting with the state delegation.

2342
03:18:03,678 --> 03:18:04,019
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, great.

2343
03:18:04,359 --> 03:18:09,743
[SPEAKER_26]: If you want to send them an official letter, but he was notified, and he is in the process of doing that.

2344
03:18:10,104 --> 03:18:14,027
[SPEAKER_05]: If we could just vote to support his endeavors in trying to help that location.

2345
03:18:14,673 --> 03:18:17,956
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Longo-Kearns, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2346
03:18:19,017 --> 03:18:19,577
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight.

2347
03:18:19,677 --> 03:18:24,421
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, I, too, got the same phone calls that the Councilor refers to.

2348
03:18:24,721 --> 03:18:31,927
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've had conversations with the project manager, Mike Winnick, as well as Dan Fields, the DOT contact and liaison.

2349
03:18:32,527 --> 03:18:38,672
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's been brought to my attention that probably the start of September, all the work's going to transfer to the other side of the bridge.

2350
03:18:38,872 --> 03:18:39,452
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, thank goodness.

2351
03:18:39,512 --> 03:18:41,373
[SPEAKER_15]: All the public utilities are going to be able to be moved.

2352
03:18:41,393 --> 03:18:44,954
[SPEAKER_15]: That was the side of the bridge that had the most significant amount of public utilities underneath it.

2353
03:18:45,594 --> 03:18:55,477
[SPEAKER_15]: That was the side of the bridge that was going to be posing the most trouble and complications during their, what seems like once in a while construction that they do.

2354
03:18:56,097 --> 03:19:08,201
[SPEAKER_15]: And come September 1st, it was my understanding that they would be moving to the other side of the street and all the work done in front of Carol's restaurant and the Zamferelli building and so forth would be complete.

2355
03:19:08,897 --> 03:19:10,760
[SPEAKER_26]: So it looks like the sidewalks are pretty much all done.

2356
03:19:10,780 --> 03:19:13,844
[SPEAKER_26]: They're all put today on the last couple of days.

2357
03:19:14,465 --> 03:19:24,420
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, but if I may, I think that maybe in terms of the direction we're going and calling the state delegation and telling them to do something, why don't we have the state delegation tell us what they're doing and see if that's something we want to support.

2358
03:19:25,301 --> 03:19:33,409
[SPEAKER_15]: So maybe it might be nice for us to have a conversation with the representative and the representative share with us what efforts that they're taking to see if that satisfies us as opposed to standing in line.

2359
03:19:33,449 --> 03:19:40,917
[SPEAKER_26]: He is in the process of setting up a meeting with the delegation and he said he would have an answer to me probably in the next week or so.

2360
03:19:41,058 --> 03:19:43,060
[SPEAKER_26]: So maybe and we'll get a meeting.

2361
03:19:43,100 --> 03:19:45,723
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't we just ask to be invited to the meeting that he's setting up.

2362
03:19:46,348 --> 03:19:48,850
[SPEAKER_26]: We will be at that meeting.

2363
03:19:50,791 --> 03:19:51,611
[SPEAKER_27]: Vice President Mox.

2364
03:19:52,312 --> 03:19:53,252
[SPEAKER_27]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2365
03:19:54,173 --> 03:19:57,275
[SPEAKER_27]: The meeting was a meeting that this council voted on and requested.

2366
03:19:58,055 --> 03:20:02,738
[SPEAKER_27]: And it was my resolution to ask that the state delegation be present.

2367
03:20:03,018 --> 03:20:03,198
[SPEAKER_27]: Yes.

2368
03:20:03,278 --> 03:20:10,123
[SPEAKER_27]: And also that the primary conversation be surrounded by not really what's taking place over there, but mitigation.

2369
03:20:10,183 --> 03:20:11,804
[SPEAKER_26]: I informed the representative about that.

2370
03:20:11,984 --> 03:20:12,164
[SPEAKER_27]: Right.

2371
03:20:13,305 --> 03:20:17,108
[SPEAKER_27]: and the impact it's had financially on these businesses.

2372
03:20:17,488 --> 03:20:28,899
[SPEAKER_27]: I realize the area is in disarray and some of those businesses have been going through this for two years now, but what is the state going to do regarding the business loss

2373
03:20:29,539 --> 03:20:32,704
[SPEAKER_27]: You can't bring, when it's lost business, you can't bring it back.

2374
03:20:33,245 --> 03:20:42,198
[SPEAKER_27]: And in my opinion, Mr. President, the state needs to step forward and we as a city need to step forward on behalf of our businesses that have been impacted by this.

2375
03:20:42,578 --> 03:20:43,620
[SPEAKER_27]: That's a state bridge.

2376
03:20:44,681 --> 03:20:46,862
[SPEAKER_27]: It's in the city of Medford, but it's a state bridge.

2377
03:20:47,222 --> 03:20:58,145
[SPEAKER_27]: We hear all too often, oh, we can't do this on a state road, or we can't do anything regarding tree trimming or sidewalk repair or street repair on state roads.

2378
03:20:58,485 --> 03:21:04,567
[SPEAKER_27]: Now we have a state bridge, Mr. President, and we have no say in what's going on in a bridge in the heart of our city.

2379
03:21:05,407 --> 03:21:07,628
[SPEAKER_27]: uh, which makes absolutely no sense to me at all.

2380
03:21:07,688 --> 03:21:12,289
[SPEAKER_27]: But, uh, that, uh, meeting that we have is to discuss mitigation.

2381
03:21:12,309 --> 03:21:12,910
[SPEAKER_27]: That is correct.

2382
03:21:12,950 --> 03:21:13,630
[SPEAKER_26]: That is what I told him.

2383
03:21:13,650 --> 03:21:19,852
[SPEAKER_27]: To discuss how we're gonna make these businesses that have been impacted financially for the last two years whole again, Mr. President.

2384
03:21:19,952 --> 03:21:21,532
[SPEAKER_26]: You are, you are 100% correct.

2385
03:21:22,433 --> 03:21:30,755
[SPEAKER_26]: And that, and that is what, when I, uh, when I, uh, had an official meeting with him, I did tell him that the, that your motion was for, for mitigation.

2386
03:21:31,516 --> 03:21:32,336
[SPEAKER_26]: And he understood that.

2387
03:21:34,905 --> 03:21:38,646
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Longo-Kearns, seconded by Councilor Marks.

2388
03:21:38,846 --> 03:21:45,308
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

2389
03:21:45,328 --> 03:21:45,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

2390
03:21:45,568 --> 03:21:45,848
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

2391
03:21:45,908 --> 03:21:46,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

2392
03:21:46,508 --> 03:21:46,648
17-603.

2393
03:21:48,609 --> 03:21:50,529
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

2394
03:21:50,549 --> 03:22:01,372
[SPEAKER_26]: 17-603, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council congratulate Amanda and Patrick Collins on the birth of their first child, Ella McKenna Collins.

2395
03:22:02,421 --> 03:22:05,083
[SPEAKER_15]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2396
03:22:05,204 --> 03:22:07,325
[SPEAKER_15]: And a lot can happen in 18 months.

2397
03:22:07,706 --> 03:22:16,714
[SPEAKER_15]: As the corner office transitions to a new administration, we saw former Mayor McGlynn reach his 50th wedding anniversary.

2398
03:22:17,694 --> 03:22:22,298
[SPEAKER_15]: And we also have seen his daughter bring another grandchild into the world for him.

2399
03:22:22,338 --> 03:22:26,682
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'd like to take a moment to congratulate Amanda and Patrick on the birth of their first child.

2400
03:22:26,862 --> 03:22:28,404
[SPEAKER_15]: They've just purchased their first home as well.

2401
03:22:29,004 --> 03:22:36,029
[SPEAKER_15]: and I think it's a great momentous occasion to see a family that's five generations in Medford continuing to stay in the family and hopefully have a sixth.

2402
03:22:36,430 --> 03:22:44,275
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, I just hope my council colleagues would join me in congratulating Amanda McGlynn Collins and Patrick Collins on the birth of their first child, Ella McKenna Collins.

2403
03:22:44,596 --> 03:22:45,837
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Knight.

2404
03:22:46,617 --> 03:22:48,039
[SPEAKER_26]: seconded by Councilor Dello Russo.

2405
03:22:48,059 --> 03:22:48,659
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

2406
03:22:49,000 --> 03:22:49,560
[SPEAKER_26]: Aye.

2407
03:22:49,701 --> 03:22:51,603
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

2408
03:22:51,623 --> 03:23:04,076
[SPEAKER_26]: 17-604 be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its extended Stephenson's Day congratulations to Patricia and David Downey on the momentous occasion of their 50th wedding anniversary.

2409
03:23:04,156 --> 03:23:05,097
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor Knight.

2410
03:23:05,117 --> 03:23:06,499
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2411
03:23:06,739 --> 03:23:07,600
[SPEAKER_15]: If anybody remembers

2412
03:23:08,721 --> 03:23:11,262
[SPEAKER_15]: their time at the Brooks Harb School or at Medford High School.

2413
03:23:11,282 --> 03:23:14,784
[SPEAKER_15]: They'll remember Mrs. Downey standing in the front door saying, how can I help you, lovey?

2414
03:23:15,324 --> 03:23:17,525
[SPEAKER_15]: And she did that for a good 35 years.

2415
03:23:18,125 --> 03:23:21,427
[SPEAKER_15]: And her son David is my closest friend.

2416
03:23:21,487 --> 03:23:23,828
[SPEAKER_15]: I met him the first day of school in kindergarten at the Brooks School.

2417
03:23:23,888 --> 03:23:27,930
[SPEAKER_15]: And we keep in touch today, even though he's moved overseas across the country about 20 years ago.

2418
03:23:28,570 --> 03:23:42,457
[SPEAKER_15]: But with that being said, it's with great happiness and great pride that I stand here today and I congratulate my friends Pat and David Downey on the momentous occasion of their 50th wedding anniversary, especially on this night, because this is a very night, this night's very special to me.

2419
03:23:42,998 --> 03:23:50,542
[SPEAKER_15]: So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to join me in wishing Mr. and Mrs. Downey a very happy 50th wedding anniversary and wishing them another 50 more.

2420
03:23:51,997 --> 03:23:55,459
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2421
03:23:55,599 --> 03:23:56,220
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

2422
03:23:56,320 --> 03:23:56,740
[SPEAKER_15]: Aye.

2423
03:23:56,760 --> 03:23:57,701
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

2424
03:23:58,061 --> 03:24:01,904
[SPEAKER_26]: Petitions, presentations, similar matters.

2425
03:24:01,924 --> 03:24:09,969
[SPEAKER_26]: 17-607, petition by Andrew P. Cassane, 23 Cushman Street, Medford, to address the Council on new growth and real estate taxes.

2426
03:24:10,609 --> 03:24:11,490
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. Castagnetti.

2427
03:24:25,317 --> 03:24:26,598
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you, Councilor, President.

2428
03:24:28,660 --> 03:24:37,508
[SPEAKER_34]: Part of my appearance, I had a bicycle injury on Mystic River last Wednesday, right where the Clippership connected path is supposed to be.

2429
03:24:38,569 --> 03:24:39,610
[SPEAKER_34]: Unfortunately, it's not there.

2430
03:24:39,630 --> 03:24:41,051
[SPEAKER_34]: There's a couple of sinkholes.

2431
03:24:42,092 --> 03:24:42,892
[SPEAKER_26]: Not quite a path yet.

2432
03:24:42,913 --> 03:24:43,473
[SPEAKER_26]: It's boring.

2433
03:24:43,713 --> 03:24:44,454
[SPEAKER_34]: Yeah, I noticed.

2434
03:24:44,494 --> 03:24:45,715
[SPEAKER_34]: I've been through a thousand times.

2435
03:24:45,755 --> 03:24:48,337
[SPEAKER_34]: I get distracted, and it costs me dearly.

2436
03:24:48,798 --> 03:24:50,879
[SPEAKER_34]: I've had injuries and broken bones.

2437
03:24:53,608 --> 03:24:59,412
[SPEAKER_34]: If I had some power in this, I would be the first on the agenda that I would take care of.

2438
03:24:59,472 --> 03:25:01,032
[SPEAKER_34]: It's public safety, not just that.

2439
03:25:01,693 --> 03:25:05,535
[SPEAKER_34]: Mystic Avenue, cars that should not be parked there when five lanes becomes two lanes.

2440
03:25:05,575 --> 03:25:07,276
[SPEAKER_26]: I'm talking about new roads, Mystic Avenue.

2441
03:25:07,857 --> 03:25:08,497
[SPEAKER_34]: Yes, we are.

2442
03:25:13,580 --> 03:25:19,123
[SPEAKER_34]: In a nutshell, Andrew Castagnetti, 23 Cushion Street, 781396.

2443
03:25:22,573 --> 03:25:23,994
[SPEAKER_34]: TIPS, T-I-P-S.

2444
03:25:26,056 --> 03:25:33,504
[SPEAKER_34]: This new growth, we've had this for many, many years, probably every year since pre-my birth.

2445
03:25:34,445 --> 03:25:47,017
[SPEAKER_34]: However, I don't understand why we don't use this new growth, which basically is real estate tax that never existed before from a development.

2446
03:25:48,605 --> 03:25:53,289
[SPEAKER_34]: Why don't they use that new growth to offset Prop 2.5 increases?

2447
03:25:55,711 --> 03:26:00,855
[SPEAKER_34]: Directly, it should be directly applied to Prop 2.5 increases.

2448
03:26:02,116 --> 03:26:03,077
[SPEAKER_34]: I don't understand why.

2449
03:26:04,118 --> 03:26:08,601
[SPEAKER_34]: Two years ago, I did the math, my real estate tax bill went up $400.

2450
03:26:11,063 --> 03:26:16,007
[SPEAKER_34]: If they apply the $1.5 million of new growth, brand new real estate taxes,

2451
03:26:16,813 --> 03:26:23,175
[SPEAKER_34]: against the 2.5%, which was $2.5 million, it would have went up $80 instead of $400.

2452
03:26:23,755 --> 03:26:29,437
[SPEAKER_34]: And this has been going on since before I was born.

2453
03:26:31,638 --> 03:26:38,180
[SPEAKER_34]: Basically, I believe this new growth, it should not be encouraged the way it is.

2454
03:26:39,300 --> 03:26:43,861
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm for smart growth, great economic growth.

2455
03:26:46,580 --> 03:26:57,784
[SPEAKER_34]: If you don't use that new real estate tax to offset two and a half increases, not only does it hurt us, it hurts us fivefold.

2456
03:26:59,565 --> 03:27:10,408
[SPEAKER_34]: First of all, you need more fire, police, school teachers, buildings, vehicles, and infrastructure improvements.

2457
03:27:12,109 --> 03:27:13,349
[SPEAKER_34]: It doesn't make sense to me.

2458
03:27:14,170 --> 03:27:14,790
[SPEAKER_34]: I'm asking,

2459
03:27:16,477 --> 03:27:38,145
[SPEAKER_34]: If you could formally ask the mayor for an answer, a formal answer, because I've tried on my own with the head of the city assessor's office, and I have not received a straight answer, although I was told he would mail me something.

2460
03:27:38,445 --> 03:27:39,385
[SPEAKER_34]: That was three months ago.

2461
03:27:40,005 --> 03:27:41,766
[SPEAKER_34]: I understand I'm not tech savvy.

2462
03:27:42,506 --> 03:27:44,107
[SPEAKER_34]: Snail mail can take time.

2463
03:27:45,313 --> 03:27:46,594
[SPEAKER_34]: But it's been three months.

2464
03:27:47,354 --> 03:28:01,000
[SPEAKER_34]: Could you please, can one councilor make a formal request to ask the mayor, why aren't we using new growth to offset prop two and a half increases?

2465
03:28:03,981 --> 03:28:04,241
[SPEAKER_34]: Sure.

2466
03:28:05,382 --> 03:28:05,662
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

2467
03:28:05,922 --> 03:28:06,242
[SPEAKER_34]: Please.

2468
03:28:06,542 --> 03:28:06,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

2469
03:28:07,623 --> 03:28:08,043
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

2470
03:28:08,823 --> 03:28:09,724
[SPEAKER_34]: Who will make that?

2471
03:28:10,044 --> 03:28:10,604
[SPEAKER_05]: All of us.

2472
03:28:13,626 --> 03:28:14,366
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you very much.

2473
03:28:14,962 --> 03:28:18,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have approval?

2474
03:28:18,445 --> 03:28:19,806
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion to receive in place of file.

2475
03:28:20,087 --> 03:28:23,530
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to ask the Mayor's formal request of the Mayor.

2476
03:28:28,260 --> 03:28:31,141
[SPEAKER_26]: A motion by Councilor Langlois-Carrion to request.

2477
03:28:31,601 --> 03:28:33,342
[SPEAKER_22]: You can take an individual vote if you want.

2478
03:28:33,602 --> 03:28:34,883
[SPEAKER_22]: It's an amendment.

2479
03:28:34,983 --> 03:28:43,847
[SPEAKER_26]: Amended by Councilor Langlois-Carrion that the mayor give an answer why the new growth money is not applied to the taxes.

2480
03:28:44,207 --> 03:28:45,968
[SPEAKER_26]: Is that correct, Mr. Kesey?

2481
03:28:46,108 --> 03:28:46,728
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, sir.

2482
03:28:46,768 --> 03:28:48,289
[SPEAKER_26]: To the two and a half taxes.

2483
03:28:48,349 --> 03:28:53,311
[SPEAKER_34]: To directly offset any proposed part two and a half increase.

2484
03:28:53,411 --> 03:28:54,271
[SPEAKER_34]: Thank you.

2485
03:28:54,671 --> 03:28:55,011
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2486
03:28:55,151 --> 03:28:56,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for listening.

2487
03:28:56,997 --> 03:28:58,678
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Langlois-Carrion.

2488
03:28:59,699 --> 03:29:00,259
[SPEAKER_26]: All those in favor?

2489
03:29:00,680 --> 03:29:00,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

2490
03:29:01,360 --> 03:29:03,061
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

2491
03:29:03,081 --> 03:29:05,123
[SPEAKER_26]: 17-609 Communications from the Mayor.

2492
03:29:06,945 --> 03:29:18,814
[SPEAKER_26]: Mr. President, City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that Your Honorable Body consider the attached resolution in support of House Bill 2683 and Senate Bill 1845.

2493
03:29:18,934 --> 03:29:27,841
[SPEAKER_26]: Unrepaired gas leaks not only emit dangerous gases into the air we breathe, but the cost of this gas, this lost gas, is passed on to the consumer.

2494
03:29:28,242 --> 03:29:33,566
[SPEAKER_26]: Please support this measure on behalf of the citizens of Medford.

2495
03:29:35,957 --> 03:29:41,622
[SPEAKER_20]: I think we discussed this in substance, apparently.

2496
03:29:41,642 --> 03:29:42,303
[SPEAKER_26]: We did?

2497
03:29:43,024 --> 03:29:44,525
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little different.

2498
03:29:44,565 --> 03:29:54,995
[SPEAKER_26]: It's a little different than what, this is actually, as the gas and electric company do, not charge us for the energy use.

2499
03:29:55,195 --> 03:29:58,017
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President?

2500
03:29:58,238 --> 03:30:00,400
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd like to amend the paper to be added as a co-sponsor.

2501
03:30:01,717 --> 03:30:05,120
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you could add, Mr. Clay can you be the one that has to read it?

2502
03:30:06,361 --> 03:30:06,561
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry?

2503
03:30:06,581 --> 03:30:08,103
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you make me be the one that has to read it?

2504
03:30:08,243 --> 03:30:09,324
[SPEAKER_16]: Do you want me to read it?

2505
03:30:10,425 --> 03:30:11,666
[SPEAKER_26]: Do you want to waive the reading?

2506
03:30:12,206 --> 03:30:13,267
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we can waive the reading.

2507
03:30:13,387 --> 03:30:16,150
[SPEAKER_26]: Waive the reading.

2508
03:30:16,610 --> 03:30:18,572
[SPEAKER_26]: Would you please add Councilor Knight as a co-sponsor?

2509
03:30:22,797 --> 03:30:24,078
[SPEAKER_26]: the bill that the mayor has proposed.

2510
03:30:24,839 --> 03:30:25,780
[SPEAKER_18]: What are we all adding?

2511
03:30:26,100 --> 03:30:26,701
[SPEAKER_18]: The resolution.

2512
03:30:26,721 --> 03:30:28,382
[SPEAKER_18]: The resolution that the mayor has proposed.

2513
03:30:28,402 --> 03:30:29,684
[SPEAKER_18]: Why don't you add the whole city council?

2514
03:30:29,744 --> 03:30:31,465
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, add the whole city council.

2515
03:30:31,525 --> 03:30:35,008
[SPEAKER_22]: We're all co-sponsors.

2516
03:30:36,110 --> 03:30:42,936
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion to... The whole council supports it.

2517
03:30:43,316 --> 03:30:44,958
[SPEAKER_26]: She's asking for the whole council's support.

2518
03:30:45,638 --> 03:30:47,300
[SPEAKER_26]: So the whole council hopefully will support it.

2519
03:30:48,895 --> 03:30:50,117
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilor, Vice President Mox.

2520
03:30:50,697 --> 03:31:04,996
[SPEAKER_27]: I think this is worthy, although I'll be quite frank with you, I haven't read both bills, but my only question I had was regarding if we're going to require them not to charge the

2521
03:31:07,073 --> 03:31:09,876
[SPEAKER_27]: the homeowner, which I think is a novel concept.

2522
03:31:10,797 --> 03:31:17,284
[SPEAKER_27]: And I assume that would require them to then, on their end, start fixing these leaks.

2523
03:31:18,125 --> 03:31:19,907
[SPEAKER_27]: Ultimately, who's going to end up paying for this?

2524
03:31:21,705 --> 03:31:34,254
[SPEAKER_27]: Um, and I, I'd like to hear from someone, uh, you know, stating, I don't know, maybe Mr. Tudin can answer that, but, uh, ultimately, I would assume they're going to pass that off to ... The consumer.

2525
03:31:34,374 --> 03:31:34,714
[SPEAKER_22]: The consumer.

2526
03:31:34,734 --> 03:31:34,874
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

2527
03:31:35,374 --> 03:31:37,136
[SPEAKER_27]: Um ... So we don't pay one way or another.

2528
03:31:37,176 --> 03:31:37,356
[SPEAKER_27]: Right.

2529
03:31:37,376 --> 03:31:44,401
[SPEAKER_27]: So secondly, Mr. President, and it's good, uh, you know, we have, uh, level three leaks, which, uh, they, they don't even look at level three leaks.

2530
03:31:44,761 --> 03:31:47,623
[SPEAKER_27]: They only look at level one and two leaks, uh, in our community.

2531
03:31:48,583 --> 03:32:01,008
[SPEAKER_27]: I would also ask, Mr. President, an issue that I've been talking about for years, that the mayor supports looking at unaccounted for gas and making a savings to the gas payers so they're not paying for that.

2532
03:32:01,508 --> 03:32:05,670
[SPEAKER_27]: And I would ask the mayor respectfully, why doesn't she look at unaccounted for water

2533
03:32:06,790 --> 03:32:12,113
[SPEAKER_27]: which every single ratepayer in this community has been paying through the nose for years.

2534
03:32:12,714 --> 03:32:14,155
[SPEAKER_27]: It's roughly 20 percent.

2535
03:32:14,595 --> 03:32:20,078
[SPEAKER_27]: It's millions of dollars, Mr. President, of unaccounted for water that we're all paying for.

2536
03:32:20,558 --> 03:32:25,942
[SPEAKER_27]: So I realize the mayor is hip on this and wants to see the people have a savings.

2537
03:32:26,342 --> 03:32:27,803
[SPEAKER_27]: I would hope she'd also like to see

2538
03:32:28,483 --> 03:32:35,507
[SPEAKER_27]: The people have a savings on unaccounted-for water, which has been a real major concern for many, many years in this community.

2539
03:32:35,827 --> 03:32:38,788
[SPEAKER_27]: Cost and the rate pay is millions of dollars, Mr. President.

2540
03:32:39,169 --> 03:32:53,516
[SPEAKER_27]: So I'd like for that to accompany this paper in asking her what her thoughts are on unaccounted-for water, because there's ways, as a community, we have over $7 million in the water and sewer enterprise account that we can address unaccounted-for water.

2541
03:32:54,677 --> 03:32:56,958
[SPEAKER_27]: So there are ways, Mr. President, that we can

2542
03:32:58,931 --> 03:33:02,113
[SPEAKER_27]: look out for the ratepayer in this community regarding water.

2543
03:33:02,694 --> 03:33:03,054
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

2544
03:33:04,655 --> 03:33:07,376
[SPEAKER_26]: As amended.

2545
03:33:09,337 --> 03:33:13,920

[SPEAKER_26]: Motion to sever.

2547
03:33:16,742 --> 03:33:19,683
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion by Councilor Knight to sever the paper.

2548
03:33:20,163 --> 03:33:21,264
[SPEAKER_26]: We'll vote on the first paper.

[SPEAKER_26]: 17612, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Medford City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of Annette Michella on her recent passing.

2623
03:36:15,543 --> 03:36:16,584
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

2624
03:36:16,604 --> 03:36:17,804
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

2625
03:36:18,044 --> 03:36:20,946
[SPEAKER_15]: It's with deep sadness that I put this resolution forward.

2626
03:36:21,126 --> 03:36:25,168
[SPEAKER_15]: Annette was wake last evening and was given her burial today.

2627
03:36:25,368 --> 03:36:26,308
[SPEAKER_15]: She's a good friend.

2628
03:36:26,368 --> 03:36:27,829
[SPEAKER_15]: Her son John and I grew up together.

2629
03:36:27,849 --> 03:36:29,170
[SPEAKER_15]: Her son Tommy and I grew up together.

2630
03:36:29,730 --> 03:36:31,610
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm very sad to see her go.

2631
03:36:31,991 --> 03:36:37,372
[SPEAKER_15]: She struggled for a very long time with multiple sclerosis and was also bravely battling cancer towards the end.

2632
03:36:38,052 --> 03:36:45,773
[SPEAKER_15]: And the illness got the better of her body, but didn't get the betterment of her heart and soul, Mr. President, through the whole time that she was ill.

2633
03:36:45,873 --> 03:36:50,274
[SPEAKER_15]: She was a constant fighter, and it's just a tragic, tragic situation to see it happen.

2634
03:36:51,334 --> 03:36:54,635
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to just offer my deep, insincere condolences to the family.

2635
03:36:55,355 --> 03:37:04,143
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, for those of us that remember Annette, we'd always see her down in Mario's Classic Barrel working down there for Mario or over at the liquor store or clerking at the liquor store on Mr. Gabb.

2636
03:37:04,163 --> 03:37:07,166
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, she's a face that's been in the community for a long time.

2637
03:37:07,706 --> 03:37:11,830
[SPEAKER_15]: She raised two great kids here in the city of Medford and she's going to be sadly missed, Mr. President.

2638
03:37:12,290 --> 03:37:13,791
[SPEAKER_26]: She was also an election official.

2639
03:37:14,072 --> 03:37:14,532
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, she was.

2640
03:37:14,752 --> 03:37:15,433
[SPEAKER_12]: I second that.

2641
03:37:15,873 --> 03:37:17,495
[SPEAKER_26]: And we get please stand for a moment of silence.

2642
03:37:29,608 --> 03:37:30,288
[SPEAKER_26]: if I could also.

2643
03:37:31,189 --> 03:37:32,009
[SPEAKER_26]: Vice President Mox.

2644
03:37:33,109 --> 03:37:40,412
[SPEAKER_27]: Annette was a staple in the Wellington area with her and her sons as was mentioned.

2645
03:37:40,892 --> 03:37:50,795
[SPEAKER_27]: She was always a friendly face at ward 7 precinct 2 and she was a terrific mother, friend, and she will be sorely missed.

2646
03:37:51,575 --> 03:37:51,916
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

2647
03:37:52,136 --> 03:37:54,136
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President we're on suspension.

2648
03:37:54,176 --> 03:37:55,257
[SPEAKER_16]: Paper 17575 off the table please.

2649
03:38:06,155 --> 03:38:30,674
[SPEAKER_16]: one seven what was that community preservation act homework petition one seven five seven five council and i um motion to receive in place on file no but the petition is not here the petitioner is not here come sunday i say that the paper is out of order mr president it's not really a petition because it's not a use of the petition process it's really something that should be referred to public anticipation you are correct thank you more questions

2650
03:38:34,052 --> 03:38:34,953
[SPEAKER_26]: What is the question?

2651
03:38:35,053 --> 03:38:35,754
[SPEAKER_26]: Would you like to move?

2652
03:38:35,874 --> 03:38:36,595
[SPEAKER_26]: Receive and place a fat.

2653
03:38:36,916 --> 03:38:37,737
[SPEAKER_26]: Receive and place a fat.

2654
03:38:38,598 --> 03:38:40,481
[SPEAKER_26]: On the motion by Councilor Naita, receive.

2655
03:38:40,961 --> 03:38:41,302
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes.

2656
03:38:41,502 --> 03:38:42,584
[SPEAKER_27]: If I could, Mr. President.

2657
03:38:43,185 --> 03:38:47,389
[SPEAKER_27]: The petitioner was here at our last meeting in July.

2658
03:38:48,089 --> 03:38:49,571
[SPEAKER_27]: The hour grew late.

2659
03:38:50,011 --> 03:38:52,233
[SPEAKER_27]: He asked that it respectfully be laid on the table.

2660
03:38:52,974 --> 03:39:03,243
[SPEAKER_27]: The petitioner had a death in his family, Mr. President, and he would respectfully ask that it continue to be laid on the table, Mr. President, so he can come up and speak on it.

2661
03:39:04,521 --> 03:39:04,821
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

2662
03:39:05,722 --> 03:39:08,405
[SPEAKER_15]: And like I said, Mr. President, it's more of a procedural issue than anything else.

2663
03:39:08,485 --> 03:39:11,368
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel as though it's something that should be done in the public participation process of the meeting.

2664
03:39:12,029 --> 03:39:17,014
[SPEAKER_15]: That's not something that can be filed at the beginning of the next meeting and be put on the next meeting.

2665
03:39:17,034 --> 03:39:19,277
[SPEAKER_15]: It doesn't have to be something that sits on the table for the entire period.

2666
03:39:19,357 --> 03:39:23,621
[SPEAKER_26]: Again, like I said, it did go to the last meeting at a very late hour.

2667
03:39:25,002 --> 03:39:35,705
[SPEAKER_15]: And they did ask that we... I just have a little bit of a concern, Mr. President, about the way that the petition process is being used and not necessarily maybe in the right way or in the right frame.

2668
03:39:35,805 --> 03:39:39,306
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the petition process is starting to become overly politicized.

2669
03:39:39,866 --> 03:39:44,368
[SPEAKER_15]: And a lot of these items that are being brought up through petitions should really be done during public participation.

2670
03:39:44,408 --> 03:39:47,128
[SPEAKER_26]: Where it is already on the agenda, I feel that we should just keep it there.

2671
03:39:47,148 --> 03:39:48,509
[SPEAKER_26]: I withdraw my motion, Mr. President.

2672
03:39:48,549 --> 03:39:50,049
[SPEAKER_26]: We currently don't have the support.

2673
03:39:53,370 --> 03:39:56,715
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay, we have one last one offered by Councilor Scarpelli.

2674
03:39:57,557 --> 03:39:59,620
[SPEAKER_26]: Be it resolved that the City Council.

2675
03:40:00,253 --> 03:40:04,916
[SPEAKER_26]: congratulate Mr. and Mrs. Adam Knight on celebrating the eighth wedding anniversary.

2676
03:40:04,976 --> 03:40:05,856
[SPEAKER_26]: Councilman Scarpelli.

2677
03:40:06,096 --> 03:40:07,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, thank you, Mr. President.

2678
03:40:08,257 --> 03:40:24,967
[SPEAKER_14]: I know Adam prides himself on wishing everybody every luck in the world, so I know that the person that deserves it more than anyone is his wife, and so we just congratulate them in making eight years.

2679
03:40:25,767 --> 03:40:28,189
[SPEAKER_14]: I said nine, but he corrected me.

2680
03:40:29,309 --> 03:40:30,811
[SPEAKER_14]: The rumor has it she might be mine now.

2681
03:40:30,851 --> 03:40:32,213
[SPEAKER_14]: You better ask your wife.

2682
03:40:32,233 --> 03:40:32,613
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2683
03:40:33,334 --> 03:40:34,135
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.

2684
03:40:34,155 --> 03:40:35,316
[SPEAKER_14]: 20 years all together.

2685
03:40:35,396 --> 03:40:36,758
[SPEAKER_26]: And thank you.

2686
03:40:36,898 --> 03:40:38,360
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll pat my own wife on the back.

2687
03:40:38,840 --> 03:40:41,283
[SPEAKER_26]: Next week will be 41 years for me.

2688
03:40:41,323 --> 03:40:41,523
[SPEAKER_26]: Wow.

2689
03:40:41,543 --> 03:40:41,664
[SPEAKER_26]: Wow.

2690
03:40:41,704 --> 03:40:43,346
[SPEAKER_26]: Congrats.

2691
03:40:43,446 --> 03:40:44,787
[SPEAKER_26]: Imagine how lucky my wife is.

2692
03:40:44,907 --> 03:40:45,068
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

2693
03:40:46,555 --> 03:40:50,036
[SPEAKER_24]: Congratulations.

2694
03:40:50,176 --> 03:40:54,638
[SPEAKER_32]: Mr. President, I moved to table the records of last week.

2695
03:40:54,958 --> 03:41:00,900
[SPEAKER_26]: The records that were passed by Councilor Knight will be tabled to the next meeting.

2696
03:41:02,200 --> 03:41:03,981
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion to adjourn by Councilor Knight.

2697
03:41:04,161 --> 03:41:06,621
[SPEAKER_26]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

2698
03:41:07,122 --> 03:41:08,642
[SPEAKER_26]: All in favor, aye.

2699
03:41:08,882 --> 03:41:09,762
[SPEAKER_26]: Motion passes.

2700
03:41:24,444 --> 03:41:25,965
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, Thomas, you've got prediabetes.

2701
03:41:26,885 --> 03:41:31,488
[SPEAKER_30]: But with more exercise and a change in diet, it can be reversed.

2702
03:41:31,588 --> 03:41:32,889
[SPEAKER_30]: I've tried exercising.

2703
03:41:32,989 --> 03:41:34,029
[SPEAKER_30]: It just makes me hungry.

2704
03:41:34,049 --> 03:41:34,490
[SPEAKER_30]: For bacon.

2705
03:41:50,551 --> 03:41:51,351
[SPEAKER_13]: I love bacon, too.

2706
03:41:51,712 --> 03:41:53,312
[SPEAKER_13]: And who really likes to exercise?

2707
03:41:53,392 --> 03:41:53,893
[SPEAKER_13]: Not me.

2708
03:41:53,953 --> 03:41:54,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Me neither.

2709
03:41:54,553 --> 03:41:55,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Nobody.

2710
03:41:59,455 --> 03:42:00,276
[SPEAKER_13]: So, we're good?

2711
03:42:00,476 --> 03:42:00,636
[SPEAKER_13]: What?

2712
03:42:01,697 --> 03:42:02,977
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, you still have pre-diabetes.

2713
03:42:05,959 --> 03:42:06,699
[SPEAKER_13]: Big time.

2714
03:42:09,801 --> 03:42:11,581
[SPEAKER_13]: Marie, you have pre-diabetes.

2715
03:42:11,802 --> 03:42:12,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Pre-diabetes?

2716
03:42:13,082 --> 03:42:15,323
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have time to eat right or exercise.

2717
03:42:15,343 --> 03:42:16,324
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a busy mom.

2718
03:42:17,270 --> 03:42:18,491
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, you're a busy mom.

2719
03:42:18,811 --> 03:42:19,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

2720
03:42:19,472 --> 03:42:20,753
[SPEAKER_13]: This is great news.

2721
03:42:20,833 --> 03:42:22,595
[SPEAKER_13]: Busy moms never get pre-diabetes.

2722
03:42:22,835 --> 03:42:23,315
[SPEAKER_13]: Wait, what?

2723
03:42:23,335 --> 03:42:30,462
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me just... Yeah, this is all the people at risk for pre-diabetes, and way over here, busy moms.
