    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2173.804s">A</a>  couple of days. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2175.605s">A</a>  couple of days.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2177.687s">Do</a>  you know when it's going to begin?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2179.928s">As</a>  soon as this is granted, we'll have the contractor go in and pull the street opening permit.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2185.19s">Do</a>  you know how many sidewalk panels are impacted? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2188.672s">Just</a>  so the residents in the neighborhood have some sort of idea.</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2191.374s">I</a>  think there was maybe 37 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2193.695s">I</a>  think there was maybe five panels. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2196.656s">Give</a>  or take a couple.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2198.022s">And</a>  will there be any impact with regard to traffic in the neighborhood?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2202.244s">I</a>  would say no. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2203.045s">I</a>  mean, I don't know if there's a lot of pedestrian traffic in the sidewalk there, but they can put some traffic control signs there to block the sidewalk and divert them around. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2213.35s">And</a>  it's basically pretty much almost a day or two's work for the most part once they excavate it all out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2221.134s">And</a>  then the biggest part of it will be going back and replacing the concrete. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2225.756s">That's</a>  what's going to take the time.</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2228.154s">Mr.</a>  President?</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2230.135s">So</a>  it's strictly sidewalk work? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2231.715s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2232.075s">Yeah,</a>  nothing in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2233.255s">And</a>  what materials are used to replace the sidewalk panels, the same existing? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2235.976s">Same,</a>  yes, it's concrete.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2237.757s">Councilor</a>  Scott, go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2238.917s">I</a>  think that I echo Councilor Knight's, one of the biggest concerns we've had in this council in the last couple of years, two years that we've been on set. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2246.959s">that</a>  whenever there's a utility company that comes in, the way they found the street and sidewalks in a better condition than, if the same or if not better condition, than it was left, because we have a huge issue with contractors coming in, representing the utilities, and then leaving sub-par work behind, and then the city is left, and the constituents are left holding the bag, so I think that it's very important that that piece <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2278.526s">discussion</a>  with the city's engineer making sure that the most approach.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2284.929s">Mr.</a>  President also looks here that the petitioner has agreed to remove an asphalt patch that's been put around another existing utility pole as part of mitigation to help fill those gaps with concrete to keep it consistent with the rest of the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2297.113s">So</a>  I have no problem with this petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2299.494s">Mr.</a>  President, I move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2301.055s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2366.843s">Okay,</a>  so this is a conduit build. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2370.485s">I</a>  guess we're starting on Granville Avenue at the railroad right-of-way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2375.848s">We're</a>  replacing a handhold and we're constructing 200 feet of conduit to a manhole location at the location of Winchester Street and Granville Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2385.494s">Then</a>  we're constructing another 722 feet to another structure, a manhole structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2391.977s">And</a>  then from that, we'd go out to a Verizon manhole that's actually in the city of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2401.715s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2402.315s">I</a>  have a lot of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2404.437s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2406.659s">So</a>  on Broadway, there's a bridge that crosses over the railway. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2413.404s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2413.944s">And</a>  in order for them to replace that bridge for the Green Line Extension Project, we have to relocate our cable, which is running right down the right of way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2424.272s">And</a>  the way to do that is to get it up <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2426.974s">into</a>  the Verizon structure and then take it from the Verizon structure down Winchester, down Granville, and get it back onto the railway beyond the bridge where they're doing the construction.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2435.991s">Tell</a>  us about the type of conduit that you're going to be building. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2439.192s">Is</a>  it a contained concrete tunnel?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2442.634s">Is</a>  it a... It's typical construction with two four-inch conduits encased in concrete, 48 inches of depth down. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2453.019s">And</a>  obviously, we're going to be looking to mitigate intersecting with anything else that might be in the roadway.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2458.869s">And</a>  are you going to be digging in the road and the sidewalks? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2461.972s">All</a>  on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2462.832s">And</a>  what kind of wiring is this?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2466.495s">So</a>  what would go back, what we're relocating is a fiber optic cable for AT&T. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2470.999s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2670.494s">So</a>  will there be someone on site who's going to be available and consistent to just help these people who really feel beat up at this point?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2680.018s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2681.239s">Siena</a>  will definitely have somebody on site while the contractor is working. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2684.82s">And</a>  who is Siena? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2686.061s">Siena</a>  is an engineering firm and we're representing AT&T. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2689.582s">So</a>  basically we will work with a contractor that will be on site.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2693.724s">Good,</a>  good, good.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2696.525s">Thank</a>  you Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2697.405s">Councilor</a>  Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2698.125s">Thank</a>  you Mr. President and some of the similar similar questions I guess but you know as far as that the length of time this project is going to take and when do you think this will begin just so if anyone here that was watching at home tonight.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2711.028s">So</a>  what we're trying to do is get this done before December is our goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2716.91s">Before</a>  the moratorium we'd like to get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2718.91s">We're</a>  still working out this grant allocation as well in Somerville and as soon as we get that we're going to get underway so <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2726.372s">We're</a>  in the process of putting all the pieces together. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2728.453s">We'd</a>  like to get started as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2730.815s">And</a>  we're looking at, depending on how things go and what the impact is in terms of traffic, it would be four to six weeks, I would think. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2738.959s">But</a>  that's the outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2741.501s">I</a>  can't say exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2743.022s">It</a>  depends on how long it takes us to get underway and if we run into issues in terms of traffic or if you have special events or any of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2752.027s">that</a>  might be impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2753.309s">I</a>  don't know if there are road races scheduled for the next couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2757.593s">When</a>  we could get out there and get it done.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2759.555s">And</a>  as far as the, so would the work hours be just your normal 9 to 5?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2763.58s">Yeah,</a>  it would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2765.341s">And</a>  if we were going to do anything, or if we were looking to get some relief on that, we would obviously come to the city and ask if we could do that.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2773.51s">And</a>  as far as the impact to the neighbors that live in that neighborhood, are we talking about they're not going to have access to their driveways? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2781.053s">What</a>  will be the impact and how will they be notified?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2783.574s">I</a>  think it would be minimal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2785.654s">Obviously,</a>  where we're working, it may take a day for us to get out of the way of a driveway, for instance, but we'll be looking to keep <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2793.797s">pedestrian</a>  traffic moving at all times, keep roadways open as much as we can, and keep driveways open as much as possible.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2802.625s">So</a>  will you be, you know, sending a notice to the neighbors? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2806.068s">I</a>  mean, just to let them know the driveway could possibly be not accessible, you know, during these dates?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2812.174s">We</a>  certainly could do something like that if we needed to.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2815.256s">I</a>  mean, I would think, you know, just I think it's a good idea just to let them know, you know, that this project is going to happen and, you know, just so they're informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2823.56s">I</a>  mean, because I think the worst thing is when there's no communication, that's when the phones start ringing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2829.522s">that,</a>  you know what, I knew nothing about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2831.683s">You</a>  know, the person that might live in the street might not know nothing about or anything about this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2837.185s">They</a>  might have minimal information, but then all of a sudden they can't get into the driveway, and they're calling us for answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2842.387s">So</a>  I think reaching out to the community, to those streets that are impacted and those neighbors that are impacted, it's definitely something that <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2849.99s">I</a>  would recommend.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2850.971s">Yeah,</a>  and I believe we did send out a listing and mailing already. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2854.394s">Okay,</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2856.636s">But</a>  once we get started, we can do that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2858.958s">And</a>  I know one of the stipulations was that we get together and sit down before we get started. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2864.002s">And</a>  we will have a schedule at that time where we can tell you what we think it's going to take us to get it done.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2870.648s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2871.208s">And</a>  as far as the, do you foresee any road closures at all?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2875.792s">the</a>  way that we have our traffic plan set up right now there are no road closures so we're not we don't anticipate that there would be actual road closures.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2883.138s">Okay</a>  I'm just concerned where if you because I think this this if I'm reading this map correctly this leads out to Broadway right?</p>

    <p>[Derek Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2889.464s">It</a>  does yeah.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2890.184s">So</a>  I'm just concerned that if you if you're closing a road in Somerville and <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2896.172s">The</a>  residents in Medford don't know anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2898.713s">There's</a>  a disconnect there, so if there are any road closures, you know, I would think that, you know, if we could just make sure that the residents know, just because the worst thing is when something insurmountable is impacting them and they don't know anything about it, you know, that's something that we should keep into, you know, take into account.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2915.717s">Yeah,</a>  absolutely, if you look at the traffic plan, I don't think we're, we're not planning on closing any roads and we obviously would like to try to keep traffic moving in all directions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2924.96s">And,</a>  you know, setting up the proper traffic plan and also getting some help from both police departments to make sure that we can keep traffic moving, that's the goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2934.664s">Okay,</a>  thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2938.725s">Actually,</a>  I think my questions have been asked and answered.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2940.966s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2942.847s">This</a>  is what it looks like, what, 948 feet of trench work that you want to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2946.469s">I</a>  think it's about almost 1,100 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2948.91s">Almost</a>  1,100 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2950.11s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2951.411s">You</a>  said something at the beginning of your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2953.012s">You</a>  said this is going to be common trench work like you see all around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2956.653s">And</a>  we've had a big problem in this city about trench work that's being performed by public utilities in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2962.539s">Just</a>  last month we had a committee of the whole meeting with the city engineer and we asked a series of questions to the city solicitor as to whether or not we could place a moratorium on trench work. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2970.546s">One</a>  of the big problems isn't necessarily you guys getting in there and doing the work that you need to do because you need to get the work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2975.491s">It's</a>  never coming back and fixing it to the standard that we want to see it fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2979.614s">That's</a>  become a very big problem in our community We're seeing a number of streets in residential neighborhoods the end and main roads alike, but again pulling up and torn apart I mean if you look at tonight's agenda for example We got 115 feet coming up after that and we're looking at 2,000 feet of trench work that we're gonna be putting through the city You know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2997.518s">I</a>  mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2997.739s">There's</a>  applications for 2,000 feet of trench work in the city and we have some questions that are pending right now before our <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3004.0s">Solicitor</a>  that I think I'd feel a little bit more comfortable getting an answer to before I move forward and supporting this paper You know a thousand feet a lot of a lot of stretch on the end It's ten football fields councillor de la rusa was absolutely right that neighborhood has been beat on for the last three four years between you know the reversals of Winchester Street in the direction that it's going in and <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3023.665s">the</a>  impact that the expansions of the Harvard Street Bridge have had, the discussion about eminent domain land takings coming up in the near future to, again, accommodate the extension of the Greenland, which I think is going to be a benefit to our community, don't get me wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3036.86s">I</a>  think the Greenland extension is a good thing for us here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3039.503s">But</a>  in the meantime, we have residents that really need to maintain a strong quality of life, and that hasn't happened in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3045.048s">So</a>  this evening, I'm having a very difficult time supporting this paper, Mr. President, if we don't have the answers that are going to come back from the city solicitor based on the committee of the whole that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3053.977s">And</a>  the committee of the whole meeting that we had was exclusively focused on trench management and the issuing of permits to public utilities and what they do to our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3061.023s">and</a>  whether or not they come back, and whether or not there's a schedule for them to come back, and whether or not we can limit the number of permits that are issued in a quarter or a year, so that we can better manage the job and better oversee the job that's being done, because I think that the focus is more on the next special permit than it is on coming back and completing the work from the last special permit that you got. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3078.686s">Now,</a>  I haven't had the opportunity of working with Siena, and I'm not sure what Siena's reputation is or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3083.747s">I'm</a>  sure you guys are great. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3084.727s">You're</a>  working for AT&T, which is a multinational company, you know, a billion dollar company, so I'm sure you guys do a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3090.408s">But</a>  we need to do some housekeeping here, in my opinion, before I feel comfortable supporting this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3096.271s">And</a>  I'm not going to be able to support it this evening, Mr. President, for the reasons that we've asked a series of questions to our city solicitor through the administration, asking for some input and some feedback as to what we can do to better manage the trench work that's being done in our community, because it's killing our streets, it's killing our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3111.7s">And</a>  the residents are speaking out against it in this particular street, in this particular neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3116.702s">They've</a>  been under the thumb of construction for the better part of three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3119.984s">And</a>  it's not going to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3123.106s">And</a>  the work needs to get done, I understand.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3124.427s">Yeah,</a>  unfortunately we're on a schedule here where we're getting forced to relocate because we're in the way of the apartment that's going to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3134.032s">And</a>  this is the way to get around that so that they can do that construction work. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3138.815s">that's</a>  what's pushing us to get this work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3142.296s">I</a>  understand that it's a cause and effect situation, I guess you'd call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3145.957s">Well,</a>  we're on the right of way, and we happen to be on the right of way in the wrong spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3151.498s">We're</a>  at the apartment where the bridge needs to be replaced, and this is the way to get around that so that they can move forward with their construction in December.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3158.94s">In</a>  this alternative here that's being presented, I would assume would be the least costly alternative to the provider, right?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3165.682s">I</a>  don't know if it would be the least costly, but it certainly is.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3169.964s">Is</a>  there another way you can do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3171.044s">We</a>  don't have to dig 1,000 feet in one of our city streets, I guess is the question.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3174.745s">I</a>  don't think that there is another way that we could do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3177.406s">I</a>  don't know that we could get our cable out of the way of the construction.</p>

    <p>[Derek Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3180.827s">You</a>  might be able to speak to that a little bit better than I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3184.008s">Derek</a>  Anderson with our design professional representing MBTA 16 Myrtle Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3189.531s">So</a>  I understand some of the trenching problems on a personal level. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3192.993s">But</a>  to why I'm here, yeah, we have, the design team has looked at multiple different ways to keep the relocation of this particular duct bank within the MBTA right away under the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3207.281s">There</a>  is not a way that we have seen where we're able to avoid any disruption to the public streets in the area, the Boston Ave or Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3216.535s">Winchester</a>  seems to be the best possible alignment for getting in and out quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3222.202s">And</a>  yeah, we've looked at those. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3224.505s">To</a>  give some sense, Broadway Bridge, there's abutments coming down on either side, a new track. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3229.109s">There's</a>  just no space between the abutments and the track to put that in.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3231.972s">There's</a>  barely any space between U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3233.213s">Travel</a>  World and, you know, from what they've done over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3235.915s">It's</a>  far away from the building, so I understand why you're not looking at it.</p>

    <p>[Derek Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3238.638s">We</a>  have absolutely looked to try to avoid disruption in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3243.262s">There</a>  isn't another way without getting into the roads.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3248.866s">Or</a>  can you go underneath the real bed? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3250.587s">Can</a>  you go through some holes?</p>

    <p>[Derek Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3252.708s">One</a>  way or another, it's got to come up onto the roads.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3256.39s">And</a>  really, Winchester is... And what do these conduits service? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3260.892s">Are</a>  they home telephones? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3262.133s">Are</a>  they internet IP? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3264.194s">Bandwidth?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3264.934s">What</a>  do they provide?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3266.215s">Yeah,</a>  it's AT&T's core... <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3269.996s">network,</a>  and it's carrying all kinds of traffic that is not only local, but it goes all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3281.16s">This</a>  particular cable has quite a bit of traffic on it that can't be rerouted, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3287.782s">The</a>  right-of-way was a place where they traditionally put a lot of network as a way to mitigate getting into town and city streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3298.471s">And</a>  unfortunately, where it is right now, we don't have the ability to get it out of his way while he builds the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3305.341s">And</a>  this is a way to work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3307.624s">And</a>  we are taking advantage of some structures that are already there and going through, coming out of the horizon.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3318.116s">I</a>  appreciate you for answering my questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3319.497s">I</a>  don't think my position is moving much off of Mr. President, although the answer is from the solicitor's office.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3326.722s">I</a>  appreciate coming out tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3329.124s">I</a>  think that's one of the biggest things that we've talked about in this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3332.906s">I'm</a>  sorry that you have a representative of this feedback, but until we make a stand, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3340.711s">and</a>  really get the feedback back from the city solicitor and all of the utility companies that have been using our streets as trenches and then walking away and leaving our streets a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3357.37s">I</a>  think that with that and <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3360.493s">plan</a>  in place for those neighbors because those neighbors again, I echo the remarks of my colleagues that they've been impacted so negatively and They're just daily daily Lifestyles and to compound that with more construction road work without a comprehensive plan that they are familiar with from beginning to end I think would be <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3383.293s">would</a>  be negligent and my part as a city council representing those people to not make sure that those concerns are not just supported by yourself, but a plan that would show us and what we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3401.545s">So</a>  I too would like to table this until we get more information from our city solicitor and what we've asked for in the past for our utilities <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3412.592s">to</a>  make sure that what's being done on our roads, that utilities are being held accountable for what they're leaving there.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3419.755s">Yeah,</a>  we'd certainly work with you guys on whatever you needed to be, you know, comfortable with our construction practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3430.639s">anything</a>  we'd need to do to help communicate with the neighbours, all the people that are impacted, we'd certainly be willing to do that.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3439.342s">And</a>  again, I apologize that you could be the one situation where it would leave the street impeccable, but when you have two foot swaths being cut and then you see them dip and nobody comes back to fix them and then <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3455.347s">Again,</a>  someone comes in and builds a four foot swap path and nobody comes back and this is what we are hearing over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3464.358s">And</a>  this is where it has been very frustrating for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3469.103s">So</a>  thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3470.385s">I</a>  appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3475.202s">I</a>  think some of the frustration you're hearing is regarding the number of projects that this city has gone through over the last couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3484.01s">Eversource</a>  right now will be trenching two miles of some of our major thoroughfares in the next several months, which is going to be a big disruption to traffic and residents in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3497.721s">My</a>  question to you is we hear all too often when we ask when a trench is dug and we all know after even with best intentions It usually sinks after a period of time and we've asked the city Solicitor why we can't request that when you're digging a trench that you've not only just paved the trench but <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3520.977s">but</a>  you do a curb-to-curb restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3523.958s">And</a>  we're being told that we can't request that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3527.479s">And</a>  I believe it has something to do with state law, correct me if I'm wrong, but we can't request a curb-to-curb repaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3534.182s">And</a>  in my opinion, if I allowed you to dig up some of my driveway, to put something under my driveway, I wouldn't request that you just patch a little piece of my driveway, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3542.525s">Because</a>  I know what's going to happen in six months from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3544.846s">My</a>  driveway's going to be a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3546.547s">And</a>  the same thing applies to our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3548.888s">So</a>  that's the first thing I think we have to look at, why we can't request a curb-to-curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3553.45s">Was</a>  a curb-to-curb requested in this particular case?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3556.731s">It</a>  was not requested in this particular case. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3559.372s">You</a>  know, if you had something that was wrong with our patch, for instance, we certainly would want to try to restore the patch.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3567.736s">So</a>  if the city did request a curb-to-curb, would you</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3572.966s">That's</a>  something that I would have to bring back to see if that's something that would be an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3578.232s">That</a>  would certainly be quite a big impact to the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3582.678s">But</a>  maybe, I don't know if it's something that we could do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3586.803s">I</a>  couldn't answer that question tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3592.11s">It</a>  would be a bigger impact overall to the neighborhood as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3596.497s">I</a>  understand that if we did have to do a full restoration for the entire trench, the trench line, that we would be looking at a pretty big impact.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3608.486s">For</a>  the neighbors and everybody the construction project would be bigger than it would be Sure sure residents who call us up in six months from now saying every truck that goes by their house shakes their house because it's such a dip <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3624.543s">You</a>  know, we hear it over and over again.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3625.944s">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3626.845s">So,</a>  I can appreciate the fact that... No, I understand that the roads are all over, you know, all over the state there's construction work going on and it's frustrating for everybody at times and patches to resettle and that's, there's no question about it that that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3644.298s">I</a>  don't know that I can say that I'd be able to do a full restoration this evening, but I could certainly inquire about it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3651.142s">We</a>  don't meet again until September, third week in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3655.163s">Yeah,</a>  and my concern is that if we don't... We're not going to meet until the third week in September.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3660.106s">Right,</a>  right, and that's my concern is that, you know, with the project, with the goals that they have for the bridge, that we're running out of time to get this project done.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3671.911s">Well,</a>  I is one member of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3673.912s">I'd</a>  hate to hold up this project I understand that you're doing the project based on what work needs to be done, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3680.713s">I</a>  Would have no problem if you would be able to give us a commitment tonight about curb-to-curb restoration That way I think would be an easier sell to the neighborhood knowing that this work is taking place But the ultimate outcome will be a brand new area street from the whole length You know, we go through projects like this <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3701.498s">the</a>  EverSource project I mentioned two months, it has zero benefit to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3707.28s">Zero.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3709.0s">I</a>  realize we all have to live together as good neighbors with other communities, but it has zero benefit to our community and it's going to have a thousand percent disruption to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3717.803s">So</a>  those are the type of things I think we're struggling with.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3720.145s">Yeah,</a>  I understand.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3721.906s">I'd</a>  be supportive tonight if you would give a commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3724.868s">If</a>  you can get on your phone, give a commitment for a curb-to-curb restoration.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3728.49s">Is</a>  that something that I could come back in, if I could get a few minutes and see what I can do?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3732.333s">If</a>  the members feel the same, I feel that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3734.474s">I</a>  think that would be a win for our community if we were able to repave the entire area.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3742.187s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3743.207s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3744.108s">Mr.</a>  President, I wouldn't be so strict as to require that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3751.131s">I'd</a>  certainly invite it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3753.832s">I</a>  am intimately aware that neighbors, that's the neighborhood I live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3759.615s">I</a>  know what my neighbors have been going through and I've been working on this as the city's liaison on one of the city's liaisons on this Green Line Extension project for <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3772.524s">12</a>  years, 14 years, something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3777.288s">And</a>  they're finally digging, they're finally going, and we want to get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3782.472s">People</a>  want to see it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3785.746s">And</a>  so I wouldn't want to be part of impeding construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3791.851s">And</a>  I can only imagine that Winthrop Street will be dug up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3795.594s">And</a>  certainly our neighbors up there will be dealing with the ambient noise of ongoing construction for the next several years with the construction of the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3809.405s">the</a>  rail bed, and then also the continued presence of the lower line moving eight, what was it, 18, 27 feet closer to their homes, and then the squeaks and the clickety-clacks of the Green Line streetcars. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3829.404s">So,</a>  that being said, I, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3835.047s">I'd</a>  like to see curb-to-curb restoration of the street, but I also know that that might involve its own inconveniences to the people, but my concern was chiefly on their having avenues of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3853.242s">in</a>  a way to get assurances that the concerns are going to be met, but I'll gladly yield to my dear colleagues and support that, but I certainly don't want to, I don't see a need to table this tonight, nor do I see a need to withhold it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3874.172s">and</a>  whole so I would like to move on it decisively tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3878.82s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3887.16s">Based</a>  upon your plans and construction guidelines and so forth, do you see a need to do any more underground work on Winchester or Granville before the completion of the Green Line extension?</p>

    <p>[Derek Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3896.442s">As</a>  part of this project, we're not anticipating utility work on Winchester or Granville.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3903.623s">Because</a>  part of the concern would be if we did go curb to curb, then that would put in effect a moratorium for digging. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3908.465s">So</a>  we require to go curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3911.245s">and</a>  paved the whole entire street, then we could say that they can't think for five years.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3914.446s">Are</a>  there other plans for other utilities to work through that area? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3917.806s">I</a>  don't know the answer to that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3919.387s">That's</a>  why it's better for them to do it the new way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3921.727s">I</a>  see if that's the way to do it.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3923.668s">They</a>  did the water and gas, that was two years ago, three years ago.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3926.248s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3931.089s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3933.49s">I</a>  see everybody's frustration, and we've had a number of Committee of the Whole meetings to try to remedy it, and we are awaiting answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3941.146s">Curb</a>  to curb will be great, but for me, what I keep bringing up in the last several years that this has been a real problem is the fact that we don't have anybody from the city to review the trench work six months from now, a year from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3955.579s">So,</a>  I mean, I'd be amenable as long as we have a condition on there that <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3960.183s">engineer</a>  or somebody from the administration does a walk-through with somebody from your company nine months from now or a year from now and if there is sinkage that it be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3969.93s">I</a>  think that might be another option.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3974.153s">I</a>  think everybody touched some great points. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3978.075s">the</a>  more detailed agenda for our constituents and those neighbours that are going to be affected, I think would have to be something that's necessary.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3989.583s">Yeah,</a>  we definitely are interested in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3992.305s">You</a>  know, I did talk to the city engineer and that was one of the points that she brought up is that we did have to meet before we got started. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3999.27s">We</a>  were going to have a construction kick-off and I think we could address some of those concerns with the neighbourhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4004.513s">and</a>  I've actually been given the okay to do curb-to-curb if you guys would like us to do the curb-to-curb, so.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4010.376s">In</a>  the petition, it says AT&T shall provide a full-time resident engineer approved by the city who will monitor the work on the city's behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4017.979s">AT&T</a>  will provide detailed scheduled weekly updates, so it is in our context somewhat. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4024.502s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4025.582s">So</a>  you just said that you've gotten the authority to do curb-to-curb?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4028.203s">I</a>  have, I've gotten the approval to do curb-to-curb if you guys would like to do it.</p>

    <p>[Derek Anderson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4032.005s">Can</a>  I elaborate on my response? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4034.366s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4035.406s">As</a>  you know, this is a design build, so when I say that we're not anticipating any work there, I can't say that there won't be any work, because I don't know what the design build is that was proposed, but we're not anticipating work there.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4049.391s">I</a>  anticipate it, and the other question I have was would <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4054.998s">You</a>  have a pre-construction meeting, obviously, with our engineering department. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4057.361s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4057.881s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4058.702s">Would</a>  you be willing to have a pre-construction meeting at maybe the South Metro Fire Station with the same people that are the abutters that are on your abuttal list?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4064.709s">Yeah,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4065.61s">Why</a>  not? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4066.05s">You</a>  know, we certainly want to keep everybody happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4068.433s">We're</a>  interested in having good neighbors and keeping everybody as happy as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4072.958s">We</a>  are going to be constructing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4074.279s">We</a>  are going to be impacting traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4075.761s">That's</a>  unavoidable. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4077.302s">but</a>  we're interested in getting the project done as quickly as possible with the least amount of disruption.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4084.083s">Mr.</a>  President, I think we're making good progress tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4086.024s">You</a>  know, a curb-to-curb solution is something that... So it's just my agreement that you're agreeing to a curb-to-curb? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4093.925s">Yeah,</a>  we're in agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4095.166s">And</a>  so could we have that as a condition? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4097.966s">If</a>  you could put that as a condition, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4099.967s">And</a>  just another condition that there's a meeting that's held for construction with the residents that are at Butters. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4104.688s">At</a>  Butters, Upper Butters.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4223.955s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4224.316s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4225.818s">Similar</a>  to a lot of the questions I asked previously regarding that previous project, when will the work take place and how long will this project last?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4236.147s">Once</a>  approved, if approved, we're still waiting for an MWRA permit that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4242.131s">We</a>  have received the permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4243.573s">We</a>  have signed off on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4244.853s">We've</a>  reviewed it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4245.794s">We've</a>  agreed to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4247.395s">It's</a>  back with the MWRA. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4248.977s">They</a>  have a new process now where we sign off on the permit first. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4252.499s">then</a>  we send it back to them and it basically goes through their board again, takes two weeks to get it signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4257.241s">So</a>  I was hoping to get this work done if approved before Labor Day, before school started. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4262.944s">However,</a>  it looks like it's gonna be sometime after Labor Day before we get that MWRA permit from them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4270.028s">The</a>  work should take, depending upon the digging, it is only 115 feet and a four by four manhole. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4276.511s">I</a>  would say probably a week, depending upon the digging, weather permitting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4282.291s">two</a>  weeks, maybe tops, it's kind of hard to say, not knowing exactly what's in there and what they're going to run into as far as the digging. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4288.955s">And</a>  it's on High Street, right?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4290.516s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4290.756s">I</a>  assume the road's going to be open, but I would imagine it's going to be probably tough to pass at times, I would think.</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4298.947s">Yeah,</a>  I did see I printed the agenda this morning and I did look at this and I did see that the chief engineer requested a traffic management plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4306.633s">I</a>  did also request that today from our traffic management people. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4310.336s">So</a>  I'm hoping to get that and, you know, shortly after Labor Day, I'll be able to, you know, bring that into the chief engineer and we can talk about if approved, moving forward with the with the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4322.145s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4324.911s">There</a>  is a chance that on Hillside Avenue, the existing conduit may be damaged. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4330.794s">So</a>  I thought that I should put this in here and make you aware of that just in case we do have to do some additional excavating on that road. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4339.477s">So</a>  there would be no surprises if this project does extend a little bit longer than anticipated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4345.34s">Hopefully</a>  we can get through that conduit, but we think it may be damaged.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4348.401s">What</a>  information, Councilor Scarpelli?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4350.202s">How</a>  many more feet would that be if there was damage?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4353.747s">I</a>  would have to look at the plan here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4355.128s">I'm</a>  not sure if he called that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4364.491s">180</a>  feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4366.232s">An</a>  additional 180 or 180 total? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4367.893s">Additional</a>  180.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4368.353s">Mr.</a>  President, so with that additional 180 feet, so how long that work would take if you have to</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4382.397s">Again,</a>  it depends upon the digging. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4383.899s">I</a>  know that's kind of off the, you know, not as busy a street as High Street, but, you know, I'm sure there's a lot of traffic that goes up and down to that area, and I believe, is it the library that's right there also?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4392.967s">Yeah,</a>  the library exits from there, and there's a couple of streets that are up in that area, so those neighbors, those residents will be impacted, it sounds like, if there is</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4404.158s">I'm</a>  hoping we can get through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4405.32s">We'll</a>  send a crew out there before we stop this, before we start the digging out on the main run, to see if we can get a rod through it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4412.488s">Best</a>  case scenario, maybe it's just damaged in a couple of spots and we have to, you know, pothole it and dig it up and repair it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4419.156s">That</a>  would be the best case scenario. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4422.387s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4422.987s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4423.287s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4424.868s">Sir,</a>  when we just did the last permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4427.229s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4428.91s">And</a>  can we have some of your feelings concerning a curb to curb pave on this project as opposed to a trench and patch in a crowd?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4435.233s">OK,</a>  again, I did see that in the comments from the chief engineer and it did call that out from trench. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4443.597s">To</a>  pay from the trench to the curb I would also I would need to go back if this was approved I would go back and just make them aware of that that that would be the requirement of the permit and Therefore it would be a business decision on our end if we were to move forward and then physically go apply for the permit so if it was approved tonight and we agreed it was agreed to you know grant the location and <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4469.605s">And</a>  then if I go back and the powers to be decide that this is cost prohibitive to do the paving to the curb, then therefore we would not apply for the street opening permit and not provide service to 92 High Street.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4485.493s">Through</a>  the chair, President Caraviello, so 92 High Street doesn't have Comcast service at all?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4491.956s">They</a>  don't.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4493.718s">And</a>  who's requesting it? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4494.598s">The</a>  whole building? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4495.199s">I</a>  don't have the name.</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4497.279s">I</a>  don't have the name of the customer. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4498.6s">I</a>  was just tasked with getting the permits to get to the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4501.14s">And</a>  then once it's there, X number of tenants within that building could request the service. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4506.302s">So</a>  it's at least one.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4511.041s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4511.862s">Councilor,</a>  Vice President Mox.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4513.443s">I</a>  believe, and I stand to be corrected, it may be a new dental group that's moving in that's requesting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4519.768s">And</a>  I would hate for Comcast to go back and then decide it was not cost effective to provide service. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4528.095s">This</a>  new business is just opening and actually reached out to me as one member of the council, seeing when it was gonna be on our agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4536.521s">So,</a>  they're really interested in getting the service to get their business up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4540.685s">So,</a>  at this point, I would, as one member of the council, just support the current work that's going on and then we can have other discussions regarding curve to curve and so forth.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4559.567s">with</a>  the same issues that I've had. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4562.928s">Again,</a>  this is a little different because it does affect constituents that need to move forward, but if approved, the same stipulation, would the residents, would you require that, would you input a plan that residents would hear, would understand the total agenda from beginning to end so they understand the <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4588.738s">complexities</a>  of the project and any issues or concerns that might come up.</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4593.603s">Are</a>  you saying having someone on site or just having a point of contact for the project?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4599.989s">We</a>  have had a point of contact. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4604.765s">reaching</a>  out to the residents and same thing, holding a meeting or getting a detailed agenda for them, schedule for them so they understand what might happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4616.55s">At</a>  least the abutters to this project understand the complexity of the job. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4625.334s">Yeah,</a>  we could do that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4629.792s">There's</a>  a location that you're requesting to dig, and I'm sure you're from around the Woburn area, so I'm sure you're familiar with the area, but right at that particular location, there were points in time where there were two MBTA buses that are driving down the street and they can't even get by each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4647.149s">It's</a>  very difficult to see what impact this is really going to have on the traffic flow in the square and the business district. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4654.7s">We</a>  had a gentleman from the square who owns a business down there, a restaurant that's getting killed by construction on the other side of the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4663.732s">right</a>  up the street on the other side. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4664.953s">So</a>  two points of entrance to certain businesses are going to be blocked or hampered or impeded for a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4670.516s">Now</a>  I know you're only going to be out there for one or two weeks tops, as you said, on High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4674.878s">And</a>  then if any residual effects happen, I'm assuming that the rest of the repair work would go up Hillsdale Road if it's damaged? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4680.081s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4680.821s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4681.261s">And</a>  that's not a major act, I don't think, it's a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4685.1s">That's</a>  not something I'm so worried about right now, because you guys don't know what's underground over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4688.562s">You</a>  don't know if there is a problem over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4690.263s">But</a>  the concern that I do have is with flow and with the trench repair work. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4693.525s">And</a>  I'm not going to give the same 25-minute thing that I just did at the last one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4697.367s">But</a>  ultimately, you know, we have a problem in the community with the way that our trenches are managed and our trenches are overseen. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4702.429s">And</a>  I don't think we're doing a very good job at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4704.57s">We</a>  need to do a better job at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4706.611s">So</a>  in order for me to be comfortable with this, I need some insurances.</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4710.456s">Well,</a>  I can say that I'm familiar with the process, and I don't know if you're familiar with this process, but we have an inspection process, and I don't know if we've done a whole lot of work in the city over the past couple years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4720.943s">This</a>  is the first hearing that I've been to in Medford, so the person who had the town before had since retired, so I don't know what work took place before then. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4728.868s">I'm</a>  sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4729.229s">Did</a>  he retire because of us? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4730.77s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4732.731s">I</a>  believe it was back in the 90s, somewhere along the 90s, the Department of Telecommunications and Energy came out with something called DTE 9822, which is an inspection process. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4744.223s">And</a>  we have our project coordinators who are assigned to this job go out and inspect the jobs 30, 60, and I believe it's either 90 or one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4753.293s">And</a>  there's a report that goes to the state every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4756.293s">So</a>  that's a task that when we do new trenches that our project coordinators are tasked with doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4762.577s">Again,</a>  I don't know if there's been a whole lot of trenching in Medford, so I can't, you know, really speak to that, but that is one of our processes, and we can, you know, it would be certainly part of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4771.263s">There's</a>  been plenty, but not the concrete amount of trenching in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4775.587s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4776.327s">Good,</a>  Chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4777.668s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4781.295s">I</a>  think since you need a permit from the MWRA, I'm just throwing it out there that we table it and get a response back from Comcast for our next meeting of whether or not you'll do curb-to-curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4791.219s">I</a>  just have an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4792.259s">I</a>  mean, I said in the last petition that I just don't want the trenches to keep sinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4796.72s">It's,</a>  you know, not right for a contractor to leave a piece of property like that, a street or a sidewalk, you know, sinking. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4806.504s">But</a>  I have a problem with requiring curb-to-curb in the last one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4810.782s">kind</a>  of swaying from that here, so I would like, I'm not, I think it should be, if we're gonna, we need to have a meeting, probably a committee of the whole meeting, and get some answers from you of whether you do the curb to curb, because that's a main thoroughfare, we definitely don't want any sinkage on High Street, and if we're gonna mandate some curb to curb, I think we need to figure out some consistency in how we're gonna do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4832.592s">I</a>  know the business needs, wants Comcast, we fought loud and clear years and years ago that there'd be competition, so I, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4840.31s">We</a>  don't feel that the business should have it, but we just need to figure out amongst ourselves some way to keep this consistent and uniform and figure out how to do that prior to probably our next meeting.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4852.358s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4853.479s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4855.021s">Typically</a>  what happens is it's the city engineer that requires, when they meet with the city engineer, whether it's going to be curb to curb or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4864.189s">So</a>  I think we should leave that up to the druthers of the city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4868.633s">On</a>  this particular case, as I mentioned, this particular business has a hardship. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4873.377s">And</a>  they need this Comcast to run their business. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4876.821s">And,</a>  you know, I don't feel comfortable waiting three weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4880.164s">It</a>  happens on the last petitioner that there was someone in the room that had the authority to grant the curb-to-curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4886.111s">This</a>  gentleman clearly does not have that authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4888.993s">And</a>  because of the hardship of that particular business that's going into 92 High Street, I don't feel comfortable, Mr. President, leaving this for another three weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4898.379s">So</a>  I will support this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4900.24s">And</a>  moving forward, I think some of our questions should be directed to our own city engineer and our own inspectional services on why work is not being put back in the manner that we see fit. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4913.227s">So</a>  I will support this petition tonight based on that, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4918.328s">through</a>  the chair I know you said you wouldn't be able to start until sometime after Labor Day anyway so I think that would only be almost a week postponement if we take this up with some answers from Comcast on September 19th and I think we need to again we just need to be consistent so I would ask my colleagues how they feel about tabling it for three weeks</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4940.203s">I'm</a>  ready to vote on it in approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4945.587s">Money</a>  that Comcast gets out of me every month, I'm sure they'll be able to <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4952.87s">Pape</a>  High Street from Arlington to Malden with no sweat.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5080.708s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5081.629s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5082.39s">If</a>  you could just tell us a little bit about the project, how long it's going to take, the hours you're going to be working, how many sidewalk panels you're going to be pulling out.</p>

    <p>[Matthew Carmody]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5091.73s">Some</a>  of the sidewalk panels were already excavated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5094.371s">They're</a>  in temporary asphalt at the moment from our previous project on Wyman at Woburn So about six to seven asphalt concrete patches should take a few days regular work hours This has been pre-construction job walk has been performed with the engineering So it's generally to take three to four days I'd say at most and all panels will be fully put in 88 compliancy and make sure it's reviewed afterwards with the city engineering department</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5117.12s">Will</a>  they be replaced with concrete? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5118.822s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5119.282s">Even</a>  the ones that are temporarily been replaced with asphalt?</p>

    <p>[Matthew Carmody]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5122.445s">Yes,</a>  so we temporarily pair them so our concrete subcontractor come in and make sure it's AD compliant, stamped, and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5127.71s">It's</a>  also in asphalt because we knew this work would be oncoming. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5131.154s">So</a>  it's only for about two to three weeks that they certainly have been in asphalt. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5134.417s">So</a>  as soon as this work is performed, our subcontractor will come in, perform the restoration with concrete.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5140.663s">This</a>  is sidewalk work, so you don't anticipate any road closures?</p>

<a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5888.105s">She</a>  says, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5889.906s">I</a>  said, you mean to tell me you took $25 from me for an appeal? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5895.446s">And</a>  now, you're not giving me a piano, you're giving me my money back. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5898.712s">She</a>  says, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5899.654s">She</a>  says, unless you pay this, we're going to suspend your license. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5902.339s">I</a>  said, where's your manager? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5904.443s">So</a>  she gave me her phone number. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5905.886s">I</a>  called her for a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5907.309s">Nothing.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5908.776s">So</a>  I finally, you know, I said to myself, forget, give up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5912.278s">And</a>  then my friend there, a gentleman, we happened to have coffee, so he happened to mention about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5918.521s">And</a>  there I am. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5920.342s">You</a>  know, I work in Medford a lot, quite a bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5924.424s">And</a>  it's very, very difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5925.985s">I</a>  have a commercial vehicle that I do a service call, which is like five minutes, 10 minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5931.768s">Now,</a>  I had pictures. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5933.529s">I</a>  showed this gentleman at the, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5936.825s">what</a>  they call the parking place there, where it says, 30 minutes free parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5941.846s">I</a>  don't know what that means. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5943.087s">Because</a>  then I got smart. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5945.927s">So</a>  I parked my car in my friend's parking lot, you know, in the rear there on Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5952.189s">And</a>  I sat at Dunkin' Donuts and watched a guy, a lady, a poor little lady with a cane, from her car, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5962.383s">to</a>  the chaos machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5964.685s">He</a>  bought a ticket before he had the chance to put the money into the chaos machine. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5969.428s">That's</a>  disgusting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5971.189s">Somebody</a>  should do something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5973.851s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5974.551s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5975.772s">Have</a>  a good night.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5977.933s">I</a>  was just wondering if you had the dates as to when these tickets were issued.</p>

    <p>[Claudio Iacono]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=5987.968s">couple</a>  of months ago I I mean I can get you a date on the next meeting I have all the paperwork show me an email I'd like to be interested in like I said I in fact it was a surprise okay I can take a look at those I'd appreciate thank you thank you Scott Billy oh don't go away don't go away</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6009.642s">I</a>  should have never left metro. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6016.584s">But</a>  I think that a lot of us have received some phone calls with these simple issues that are very big, and I think that this council has asked for meetings and we've had meetings with the republic pocket or have they changed their names again? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6033.627s">So</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6034.147s">So</a>  the issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6038.247s">I</a>  appreciate you coming up and talking about it because we've had a lot of concerns with, you know, I've had a person call that they got a ticket of 201 for blocking the sidewalk as they parked in the driveway. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6052.003s">It's</a>  something that simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6053.064s">So</a>  the understanding that our residents don't know what <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6058.557s">what's</a>  going on and when it's going on is very important that we meet again and really start pounding and putting some, you saw what had just happened when this council works together and putting restrictions and things happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6072.382s">So</a>  I appreciate you coming out and sharing that because I think we need to do the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6075.863s">So</a>  thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6076.884s">On</a>  that same point, Councilor Schapiro is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6081.745s">And</a>  I think it was probably four months back where we were inundated with complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6086.573s">And</a>  we did sit down with Republic Park, and maybe this was around the same time that you were getting the tickets, about four or five months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6092.437s">And</a>  they had a whole new changeover in staff that wasn't trained properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6097.681s">So</a>  we did meet with the head of the company that's in charge of this area, and he did reassure us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6102.885s">And</a>  we cracked the whip, and we asked the mayor to do the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6106.688s">And</a>  since then, the complaints that I've received have slowed down tremendously. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6112.292s">But</a>  there was a time frame, a couple months span, where we were getting <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6116.63s">I</a>  mean, a couple complaints a day, it seemed like, and it was just that the traffic was not trained properly, which. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6121.387s">they</a>  need to get a handle on if they have another turnover. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6124.528s">So,</a>  just letting you know, we did meet with the company.</p>

    <p>[Claudio Iacono]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6127.39s">The</a>  only comments I have about this is if the machine is broken, two machines are broken, and you have a picture of them, because these iPhones, the best thing in the world, and you go up to someone in the office, should say, okay, where did it happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6146.119s">What</a>  happened? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6147.039s">I'm</a>  going to send someone to fix it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6149.34s">But</a>  when you walk into that office two or three times, I have nothing to do with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6156.185s">Why</a>  are you here if you have nothing to do with this? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6159.107s">See</a>  the city councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6160.388s">That's</a>  why I'm here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6161.309s">See</a>  the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6162.249s">I</a>  mean, the mayor is busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6165.512s">She</a>  has a lot to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6167.193s">City</a>  councilor is busy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6168.854s">Someone</a>  should be in that office that can answer these questions.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6172.117s">We'll</a>  go after it now.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6173.458s">Mr.</a>  President? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6175.818s">Vice</a>  President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6177.3s">Just</a>  a quick question so I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6179.263s">You</a>  paid the $25 to have a hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6182.467s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6182.727s">Then</a>  you decided to pay the tickets and you didn't want the hearing.</p>

    <p>[Claudio Iacono]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6186.733s">No,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6187.694s">That's</a>  wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6188.715s">He</a>  was denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6189.697s">I</a>  was not denied. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6191.439s">I</a>  was never. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6193.281s">never</a>  notified, but my next notification was if I don't pay $45 within seven days, I would have my license pulled away and my registration pulled away. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6204.017s">But</a>  you never had a hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6205.78s">And</a>  they never gave me the money back.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6209.692s">Mr.</a>  President, we should also request, Mr. President, that this gentleman get his money back, first of all. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6216.836s">The</a>  $25 is for a hearing, if he never had a hearing.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6218.977s">If</a>  you can get me the information, I would be happy to. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6221.738s">I</a>  will. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6222.058s">It's</a>  my counsel's will.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6223.519s">I</a>  will, absolutely.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6224.539s">If</a>  you give it to Ray, Ray will give it to me.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6226.621s">I</a>  will, I will. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6227.941s">It's</a>  my understanding, Mr. President, when these kiosks are not working, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6231.723s">that</a>  they get an electronic message to their main office. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6237.264s">So</a>  they know when these machines aren't working. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6239.585s">So</a>  it's not even a matter of them going out or having a resident say they're not working. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6243.166s">They</a>  know when they're malfunctioning and they should be out there immediately servicing these machines so residents don't have to walk 30, 40, 50 yards to get another kiosk, which is unacceptable in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6255.669s">So,</a>  if we can make that part of the report, too, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6258.732s">What</a>  is the turnaround once they get notified of a kiosk that's malfunctioning?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6264.538s">And</a>  please give that to Ray and let Ray give it to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6266.92s">I</a>  appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6269.803s">It</a>  almost sounds like the gentleman received two tickets, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6272.185s">You</a>  received one ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6274.086s">You</a>  received two tickets and you paid $25.</p>

    <p>[Claudio Iacono]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6275.147s">The</a>  second one was almost on progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6278.188s">The</a>  second one? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6278.668s">I</a>  wanted to see what.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6279.948s">So</a>  you came in there and you went and paid 25 bucks.</p>

    <p>[Claudio Iacono]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6282.229s">I</a>  paid for both tickets.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6283.529s">Oh,</a>  you paid for both tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6284.369s">I</a>  paid for both tickets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6285.33s">Okay,</a>  all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6286.33s">It's</a>  sad because it almost sounded like you paid for one but not the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6288.931s">No,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6289.271s">When</a>  you went in there, you appealed one and paid for one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6291.592s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Claudio Iacono]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6292.152s">Plus</a>  I paid $25 for the appeal and I got the money back.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6305.101s">Mr.</a>  Scalpo has not completed his. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6308.423s">He</a>  has one more thing to read. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6309.403s">Real</a>  quick, real quick.</p>

    <p>[Ray Scarfo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6312.084s">Brianna,</a>  I'm going to blow your meeting out of the water that you had with the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6317.607s">July</a>  15th, a resident at Yale Street <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6323.718s">He</a>  purchased a vehicle, no he didn't purchase a vehicle, he changed his plates from one state to our state. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6331.74s">Got</a>  his plates that day, put them on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6334.941s">At</a>  night, he got a ticket for an expired inspection sticker. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6341.323s">Now,</a>  when you have new plates going on your vehicle, you have seven days to get your vehicle inspected. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6350.511s">for</a>  what reason that they give these tickets out without knowing or I don't know if they have a program that they can reach into the registry to be able to see what the situation is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6362.637s">I</a>  mean, they shouldn't be just going and giving a ticket for an inspection sticker unless they know for sure that there's a valid reason to give that inspection sticker, a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6375.061s">So</a>  this is what happened is that he, like I say, he purchased new plates. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6381.525s">That</a>  evening, that same evening, he got a ticket for an inspection that wasn't valid. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6387.79s">And</a>  like I say, he has 10 days to get that sticker. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6391.492s">So</a>  of course, that cost him. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6393.251s">I'm</a>  not even sure what the amount was. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6396.432s">Did</a>  he appeal? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6397.472s">Did</a>  he appeal the ticket? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6399.753s">Because</a>  obviously it was issued in violation of law. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6401.853s">He</a>  has appealed the ticket, but he hasn't gotten a hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6407.875s">My</a>  question is that if they're going to be tagging for inspection stickers, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6413.447s">stuff</a>  like that, they should be able to be in their computer, that they should be able to get to the registry to see if they can actually do this.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6421.469s">If</a>  you could get me a copy of that one also, along with that other gentleman's, it would be appreciated and we'll bring it to the attention of park managers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6433.452s">Do</a>  you have it with you? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6436.201s">No,</a>  I'll have to get it to you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6437.182s">If</a>  you can get it and give it to me, I'd appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6438.943s">And</a>  I think maybe it's time that we schedule another hearing, a meeting with the parking benefit people.</p>

    <p>[Ray Scarfo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6444.408s">That's</a>  my closing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6445.189s">My</a>  closing, if you don't mind, I'm requesting that the council have a public meeting and to have a representative of public parking to discuss these inconsistencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6456.979s">And</a>  I think that would be a good idea to get the citizens involved in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6461.142s">And</a>  then you're really going to see how inconsistent this is.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6464.273s">Well,</a>  we've had a public meeting with them before, and as Councilor Longo said, tickets slowed down dramatically and a lot of things did get corrected. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6475.429s">I</a>  think that was about six months ago? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6477.432s">Less</a>  than that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6479.315s">Yeah,</a>  so maybe it's time we have another hearing with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6481.317s">Again,</a>  it is a public hearing, and we can bring some other things to the attention.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6488.706s">Mr.</a>  President, I think every meeting that we have is a public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6490.928s">I</a>  mean, every meeting that the council has when we convene is a public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6495.714s">And</a>  I think also that it's important to point out that <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6499.818s">oversight</a>  and the implementation of the traffic regulations falls under the jurisdiction and purview of the Traffic Commission and Republic can come all they want, but if the Traffic Commission is not on board as the oversight agency, then we quit talking to the DEFI as we're talking to the wall. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6515.98s">This</a>  is under the purview of the Traffic Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6517.862s">This</a>  is something the Traffic Commission establishes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6519.664s">They've</a>  contracted out with an entity for parking management purposes and the purposes of the contract is to enforce the existing parking ordinances that are constructed through the Traffic and Parking Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6529.911s">So</a>  I think that if we're going to do anything that should be important that they're involved as well, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6533.534s">And</a>  I can totally understand, however, you know, also <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6537.637s">looking</a>  at this thing on a citywide basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6540.718s">There</a>  are inconsistencies, there's no question about it, but I think that we need to come up with a better solution than, you know, I have this ticket happen on this day at this place, this guy did this at this place. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6551.64s">You</a>  know, that approach doesn't really bring us to a solution, Mr. President, and I think we need to come up with some solutions as to what it is that we need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6560.442s">And</a>  some of these things that are going on in the community have been what I would call <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6565.203s">laughable</a>  in moments, and you know what I mean, just wrong in others. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6569.225s">And</a>  I've had good luck in speaking with Mr. Stackhouse and explaining the situations that are going on in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6574.767s">But</a>  part of the issue that I have, Mr. President, is that when we said let's bring parking into Medford, let's bring parking enforcement into Medford, that the focus was on freeing up spots in our central business districts to prevent people from other communities coming in here and taking up spots in our downtowns. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6590.072s">And</a>  it's expanded upon that and I was a little bit more comfortable when the focus was on our business districts, not in our neighborhoods, not on streets that are dead ends, not on streets that have had families living on these streets for 30 and 40 years like Sylvia Road where they have individuals that have a system of how they park because they've all lived together and they're good neighbors and they know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6609.444s">So,</a>  they might block a driveway or they might park with two <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6612.106s">tires</a>  up on the curb so that cars can get by. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6614.609s">Now</a>  the gentleman on Brookings Street, Brooks Parker, spoke about a commercial vehicle. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6618.773s">Well,</a>  the guy lives on Sylvia Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6620.135s">Well,</a>  that vehicle is off of Sylvia Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6622.017s">Why</a>  was it off Sylvia Road? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6622.998s">Because</a>  the neighbors went to him and said, you can't park your car here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6625.3s">It's</a>  a commercial plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6626.441s">We</a>  can't get up and down the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6627.603s">And</a>  they've policed themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6628.604s">And</a>  they've been able to do that successfully for a number of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6630.846s">And</a>  we're coming into a situation now where <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6632.848s">I</a>  think Park Medford's focus is leaving the business districts and coming more towards the residential neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6637.913s">And</a>  we need to really realign and refocus the direction that they're going in, because I don't think it's making the residents' quality of life any better. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6644.7s">And</a>  I don't think that it's really meeting the objective and goal that was stated when it first came out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6649.124s">So</a>  I appreciate you taking the time to come up here, Mr. Scott, for all the work you put into doing it and investigating. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6654.069s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6654.589s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6660.816s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6662.897s">David</a>  McKillop, 94 Rockland Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6665.418s">I</a>  just want to touch base a little bit on this one situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6670.56s">I</a>  have traveled just about every business district in Medford, as well as a lot of the residents, and I think that this is, I actually agree with Adam Knight that this is a systemic problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6681.564s">This</a>  is not a singular problem in specific areas of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6685.545s">And</a>  what I mean by systemic is that I really firmly believe that it's time to take republic and kind of put their feet to the coals at this point and decide what it is that we want to do with this program. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6698.738s">It</a>  does not behoove the city to not have somebody that's working with this program that doesn't have a vested interest in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6704.944s">And</a>  I think that's what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6706.045s">On</a>  a customer service level I think what we've done is unfortunately we've made a lot of people unhappy whether they're traveling from downtown to downtown or even some of the businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6715.456s">I</a>  beg to differ in one area in the respect of talking to the business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6720.763s">If</a>  you talk to a lot of the business owners a lot of them will blame their <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6724.647s">current</a>  business status on the parking. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6727.168s">And</a>  perceptions are realities. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6728.489s">When</a>  someone's perception is that, you know, their business is down, that's their reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6732.851s">And</a>  I think we have to take that into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6735.873s">Number</a>  two, what we've also done in creating this situation, again, going back to Adam's, Councilor Knight's point, is that we've actually forced, yes, there are extra parking spaces in the downtown, but we've forced those commuters into the neighborhoods, even further in, deeper in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6752.922s">So</a>  it really hasn't helped. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6753.962s">It's</a>  actually hurt tremendously. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6755.883s">So</a>  it's either we put Republic on notice and let them know that this contract is not a contract that we're all excited about anymore, that we need to kind of put their feet to the fire and make something happen for the downtown communities, for the citizens, and allow them to be able to go in and out of their downtowns feeling good <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6774.608s">about</a>  what they want to accomplish. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6776.209s">The</a>  kiosks, my personal opinion, do not work in downtowns. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6780.372s">They</a>  just don't work. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6781.253s">They're</a>  better in parking lots than the garages, but they're certainly not good on downtown streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6786.076s">That's</a>  just my opinion, and I think it's time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6788.797s">I</a>  actually feel bad that the city council has to address all of these issues when it actually should be an in-house program for the city, created by the city, controlled by the city, not another outside entity. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=6801.065s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7059.66s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7060.401s">I'm</a>  sorry, was I talking too much? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7061.642s">No,</a>  no, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7062.863s">We're</a>  here to listen. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7065.565s">Okay,</a>  no, I'm done.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7066.766s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7067.667s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much and thank you very much for your patience going through the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7071.15s">I</a>  know it can be a confusing and daunting task sometimes to get involved in government when you're not familiar with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7076.975s">Ultimately,</a>  the sign was 11 feet tall when it was brought forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7079.617s">They</a>  had a rendering of a gentleman that said it was six feet tall next to the guy that was assigned to him way over his head, so we all had a number of concerns about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7086.401s">It's</a>  at the location of the church right next to the Brooks School, so there was some concerns about sight lines and visibility and whether or not it was gonna impact pedestrians and cars driving up the street and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7097.327s">I</a>  think in our discussions, we said that we're not really opposed to the sign being five by eight, but based upon the rendering that we have here, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7105.312s">confirmation</a>  and some assurances that, you know what I mean, it's going to be a little different. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7108.434s">So</a>  this is something that I've been waiting to hear at the council floor since you came in for your first application. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7114.998s">We</a>  went through the subcommittee process and the subcommittee did a great job on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7117.82s">You</a>  know, and I certainly don't have a problem supporting the sign this evening and I'll move for approval, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7123.343s">I</a>  second that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7124.124s">Motion</a>  on the floor for approval? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7126.465s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7126.965s">By</a>  Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor, motion by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7133.828s">I</a>  just have one question, this is not internally illuminated? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7137.629s">This</a>  is not illuminated, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7139.03s">It</a>  is an illuminated sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7140.73s">It</a>  is illuminated?</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7142.391s">Yes,</a>  it always has been.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7144.432s">I</a>  retract that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7145.412s">Okay,</a>  I don't recall, I don't see it in the fonts, logos, right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7152.455s">It</a>  doesn't state it in the.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7154.515s">It</a>  is if you look in the application.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7156.748s">Okay,</a>  because what you gave to us doesn't state that it's illuminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7163.374s">The</a>  application doesn't come before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7165.516s">PVC</a>  and internal lighting.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7167.898s">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7172.382s">The</a>  original didn't have that.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7176.126s">Yep,</a>  the first one was and the second one is as well.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7181.118s">It's</a>  not being denied because of lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7183.84s">No,</a>  it was it wasn't.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7187.223s">It</a>  was always size and height was always high.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7190.505s">But</a>  this council has been on record for many other previous signs, in particular freestanding signs against the woman age, especially hours of operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7201.653s">I</a>  mean, is there a recommendation with elimination?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7204.756s">Just</a>  a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7205.977s">Also</a>  want to occur through the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7208.639s">When</a>  will the elimination take place? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7210.28s">Is</a>  it <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7211.36s">24,</a>  is it during the dark 24-7 or will it be shut off at 10 p.m.?</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7217.223s">No,</a>  just during daylight, just during, because we, pastor is going to be during church, during 9 o'clock, 10 o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7229.289s">until</a>  6 o'clock at night, we're off, we're done, because it's only for message during the day and during service hours, and then it's off again. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7240.157s">So</a>  it's not going to be on at night at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7242.198s">Oh,</a>  so it will be in service. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7243.819s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7244.66s">It's</a>  just message during service. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7245.901s">What</a>  pastor wants to do <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7247.862s">It</a>  doesn't want, we want to kind of offer a message to the community during service hours and during day. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7255.506s">We</a>  don't want this to be like just solely a Haitian church. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7258.587s">We</a>  just want to have services, second service, an English service offering <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7264.55s">We</a>  don't want the community to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7265.99s">We</a>  just want to put a message out there that they can come in for services during service hours, during Sundays. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7274.233s">We</a>  don't want this to be so behavioral. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7276.173s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7276.574s">We</a>  do not want this to be all night because that's electricity. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7280.355s">And</a>  if you know my pastor, it will not happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7283.056s">It</a>  will not have that electricity going in at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7286.116s">It's</a>  not going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7287.937s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7289.398s">Mr.</a>  Chairman, both chairman of this meeting and all of the side committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7296.001s">I</a>  offer a motion of approval for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7301.463s">Looks</a>  Cholera. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7303.344s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7305.885s">So</a>  if I could make the condition, a portion of the sign is for messaging.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7312.468s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7313.588s">So</a>  so you anticipate to have what a rotation of</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7318.019s">Yes,</a>  messaging is coming for Sunday service. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7320.341s">This</a>  is a message that's going to, this is a message that's going to come in on Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7324.643s">Please</a>  come in on Sunday for service at this hour, nine o'clock service. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7329.086s">Sunday</a>  school starts. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7330.687s">Just</a>  general message for people to come in on our Sunday school service.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7335.01s">Are</a>  you aware of the current sign ordinance that regulates how often you can change a sign, the messaging on a sign?</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7344.051s">We</a>  don't, but my pastor is kind of not very technical savvy, so somebody is going to have to help him with that, so I'm pretty sure that, you know, one of us is going to have to help him, so that's probably not going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7357.057s">It's</a>  probably going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7359.11s">It's</a>  probably going to be on a rotation basis, whatever message that we put in.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7363.735s">So,</a>  Councilor Wong-Tam. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7365.556s">I</a>  think to clear it up, it's not going to be a scrolling message. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7367.939s">It's</a>  going to be like one week it will say the X, the next week it will say something different. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7372.443s">So,</a>  it's going to be something every 10 seconds.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7374.505s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7375.286s">It's</a>  basically just really kind of like the message of Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7379.79s">Sunday</a>  school mostly like Sunday school date of events Mostly, I mean we had an event on in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7388.273s">We</a>  haven't had an event again since September So basically there wouldn't be anything to announce again until like every Sunday Sunday school. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7396.356s">This</a>  is the schedule for Sunday We have a service once on Sunday So if we do decide to go with the English language service, so it's gonna be 9 o'clock and 12 o'clock This is the two service that we have <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7408.721s">And</a>  this is the messages that's going to be happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7410.762s">So</a>  that's probably what we're going to be announcing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7413.002s">So</a>  it's not going to be — it's not a business, so I don't see the need to have tons of messages every single day going on on this thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7423.845s">So</a>  on the week that we have revivals, which we have three times a year, revivals. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7430.386s">We</a>  probably will have a message say this is what the message is going to be tonight and tomorrow There's gonna be another message every night. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7438.211s">There's</a>  a there's gonna be service for revival seven days So every day there's gonna be a message for what the message is going to be tomorrow for revival So that's that type of stuff.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7447.296s">So</a>  Council Scarpelli again, I think this is why <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7450.878s">having</a>  that subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7452.58s">That</a>  meeting is so important. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7454.783s">I'm</a>  spinning right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7455.604s">I'll</a>  be honest with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7457.426s">I'm</a>  trying to gauge. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7459.588s">So</a>  the conversation would have been understanding what the ordinance is so you understood. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7465.475s">The</a>  more in-depth conversation would <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7468.678s">would</a>  have been the acceptance of the size of the sign. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7472.402s">If</a>  it's illuminated, would we accept it? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7474.704s">So</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7475.545s">I</a>  look for guides from my senior colleague on this committee.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7483.673s">Councilor</a>  Falco has a thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7487.965s">Is</a>  that the actual section that has the message piece?</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7493.006s">Yeah,</a>  so the top part is going to be the logo of the church. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7496.327s">That's</a>  not going to be illuminated at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7498.647s">That</a>  would cost the church way too much money. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7502.108s">It's</a>  just literally down in the bottom. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7504.328s">Just</a>  that revival piece.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7506.108s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7507.529s">I'm</a>  just trying to look at the sketch here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7509.209s">Is</a>  that three feet? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7515.78s">It</a>  says you have one here and then four.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7517.746s">Is</a>  that three feet of?</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7521.396s">This</a>  here, is that?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7523.517s">It's</a>  like probably two feet worth of. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7525.418s">Is</a>  it two feet?</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7526.058s">Yeah,</a>  that's about like maybe.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7527.499s">Three</a>  feet of messaging?</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7528.8s">Two</a>  feet? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7529.52s">That's</a>  about two feet.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7530.601s">So</a>  it's about two feet of messaging?</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7531.861s">That's</a>  a lot less.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7534.082s">It</a>  looks like that's a foot there, so two, three, four, that's three feet of messaging.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7538.344s">This</a>  one is the pedestal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7540.265s">That's</a>  the pedestal.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7541.346s">Okay,</a>  so that takes you a foot out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7542.967s">Yeah,</a>  that's the pedestal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7544.948s">So</a>  one to four. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7547.469s">No,</a>  no, no, the whole width is four.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7549.986s">All</a>  the way to the top is four. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7550.666s">Yeah,</a>  the whole thing is four. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7551.647s">So</a>  that's half of it, it's two feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7552.868s">Oh,</a>  okay, so that's two feet, okay, okay.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7554.548s">I</a>  thought there was a line there, I'm sorry, it's my mistake.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7556.65s">So</a>  two feet is going to be.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7558.29s">So</a>  two feet, so it'll become almost like a mini movie screen almost?</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7561.432s">Yeah,</a>  that's it, yeah.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7563.273s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7563.673s">No,</a>  because if you, that's actually. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7566.275s">It's</a>  four. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7568.236s">Oh</a>  yeah, yeah.</p>

    <p>[Marie Wolverson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7569.776s">The</a>  top part of it is going to be the logo and then it's going to be the Evangelical Haitian Church, so that's just basically paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7576.814s">That's</a>  not going to be illuminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7578.596s">It's</a>  just the bottom part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7580.338s">That's</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7581.079s">That's</a>  going to have to be the message of the day.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7583.601s">I</a>  mean, Councilman, I might have a resolution, but I think maybe that's what I'm aiming for.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7588.587s">Councilman?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7589.388s">I</a>  personally, Mr. President, have lived next to churches and across from churches with my address on High Street where I have two churches that are right next to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7598.394s">One</a>  church has a sign and one church doesn't. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7601.22s">The</a>  church that has a sign that's in nonconformity with our sign ordinance always has a message posted on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7608.393s">The</a>  church that doesn't have a sign, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7611.087s">Instead</a>  puts two stakes out there and puts a banner out there and they change the banner from time to time and it looks awful. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7616.472s">It</a>  looks absolutely terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7618.034s">It's</a>  an eyesore to the neighborhood really. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7619.956s">And</a>  I think that, you know, this isn't going to be harmful provided that we can put some restrictions on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7625.722s">It's</a>  a special permit request. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7627.023s">They're</a>  asking us to issue a special permit and we have some concerns about internal illumination. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7632.068s">Assuming</a>  that the concerns of my Councilors have about internal illumination are that they don't want it lighting up the sky at night So we can put restrictions on it eight o'clock nine o'clock ten o'clock Whatever it is that we feel comfortable And we can also put restrictions on it if we approve the side to say that they won't put any hang any banners or any other <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7648.538s">type</a>  of materials in the front lawn, so ultimately we'll have a clean, crisp look. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7652.1s">It</a>  may be a little bit bigger than we're used to, but at least we're still protecting the quality of life in the neighborhood, because I think a big sign that's lit up, that's controlled in the certain hours that it's controlled to be litting up is much better for the neighborhood than two posts that are stuck up there with an old sign that's hanging down the middle, and then it gets changed every three days, and it flaps in the wind, and it looks terrible. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7669.031s">So</a>  I'm inclined this evening, Mr. President, to support the petition as filed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7673.397s">However,</a>  I know that my colleagues have concerns and I want to be a part of coming up with a solution that we can all have by putting our heads together. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7679.085s">And</a>  I think that putting restrictions on the application would probably be a solution that could kind of satisfy everybody behind the rail.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7685.81s">My</a>  recommendation as chairman of the committee would be, because it's a freestanding sign, because it's internally illuminated, because it involves movement, I think it merits a subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7697.675s">We</a>  can get one within the next week and a half, two weeks, very soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7702.377s">We</a>  had one already that I know you were out of town and couldn't attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7705.359s">So</a>  that would be my recommendation to this body that we meet in subcommittee just to iron out and put forward the best proposal.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7713.522s">Yeah,</a>  I too, I wouldn't, I just think, I concur with Councilor Knight putting some restrictions, but I think that has to be done in subcommittee. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7723.129s">So</a>  again, I support the subcommittee, moving this to subcommittee and doing it relatively soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7730.174s">which</a>  we can move pretty quickly, but I think we need that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7735.38s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7736.361s">Mr.</a>  President, I withdraw my motion for approval and second the motion that this be sent to the subcommittee on science, et cetera.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7749.114s">I</a>  don't want to have a second, but second, I don't want to have a second by Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7753.996s">All</a>  in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7754.516s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7982.821s">Okay,</a>  if we could table that until Councilor Knight gets back. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7986.663s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7987.444s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7988.084s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7990.242s">17-596</a>  offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7993.186s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford City Council is presented with a potential. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=7997.48s">expenditure</a>  bond requests with our bond requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8000.663s">We</a>  are also presented with an itemized breakdown of how the money will be spent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8005.267s">Be</a>  it further resolved that we be that we be provided with the information at least one week prior to the City Council meeting rather than in the night before being told it's an emergency. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8016.178s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8017.579s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8019.941s">This</a>  sparked off of our July meeting, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8023.495s">We</a>  were here about 5-ish in the evening and our meeting went until about 12, 12.30 in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8030.842s">And</a>  one of the last agenda items was an expenditure of $4.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8039.597s">I</a>  just wanted to, you know, we did vote for it, but I woke up the next morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8044.118s">I</a>  voiced my frustration with regards to a lack of a breakdown of that money, and then I woke up the next morning and I, you know, was a little frustrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8055.101s">My</a>  frustration continued. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8056.821s">So</a>  I did email finance department, treasurer's department with all my additional questions, and I did eventually get the answers I wanted. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8066.581s">It</a>  was a project that obviously needs to be done, but I just wanted to make a point to put it on the agenda to let people know that I was frustrated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8075.346s">We</a>  were given, again, $4.5 million. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8078.167s">We</a>  were given an explanation, besides a couple of lines in our agenda, we were given a four or five page explanation of the project broken down by individual street the night of our meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8093.532s">So</a>  when we notice it, it all depends on when we read additional information that's on our desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8099.217s">I</a>  was paying attention to the meeting and I didn't see it until it was actually before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8104.861s">Scrambling</a>  to read it the night of a meeting at 11.30, 12 o'clock at night, it's difficult. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8112.747s">Lights</a>  were beaming on us and we were tired and it's some information that I would expect to receive at least <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8120.746s">a</a>  week prior to a vote of such magnitude. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8124.169s">So</a>  I wanted to get a vote by the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8128.072s">And</a>  to continue with that, the explanation didn't have a breakdown of the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8132.957s">It</a>  was broken down two different ways how we were going to get the money, but it wasn't broken down by street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8139.662s">Thankfully,</a>  I got it the next day, but I would just like to request that the administration provides us <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8149.123s">You</a>  know, we always talk about transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8151.505s">I</a>  just would like that we be provided information on expenditures a week prior to the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8157.751s">That</a>  it be something, you know, we stuck strong tonight and we obviously hopefully will create some change going down the line on trench work and road work within our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8168.56s">We</a>  stuck strong and had parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8172.577s">a</a>  few months ago, and we made significant changes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8175.079s">I</a>  think we need to stick together as a body and say to our administration, we need information before it is presented on our council agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8184.146s">We</a>  should not be given information on a project, on an expenditure, on a bond request, the night of our meeting, at 7 o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8192.473s">It</a>  should be weeks, if not days, before our meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8196.476s">And</a>  that expenditure should be broken down in detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8199.61s">And</a>  that's something that wasn't done for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8201.112s">And</a>  it's something we're, as a body, not mandating. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8204.716s">And</a>  I think I'd like to take a vote tonight that we request and mandate that we be given an explanation and a <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8213.801s">expenditure</a>  breakdown seven days prior to our meeting and make a change and all stick together and try to be able to, I mean, it's very frustrating when you know, oh, the next day somebody is going to be asking you questions about it and you don't have it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8226.665s">You</a>  don't have the information of how much money is going to go to Paris Street, how much money is going to go to Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8231.487s">We</a>  didn't know that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8232.667s">We</a>  voted for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8233.547s">It</a>  was very late. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8236.108s">And</a>  that's the way it happened, but I think going forward, we owe it to the taxpayers of this community to get information prior to taking such serious votes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8245.878s">So</a>  I'd ask for a roll call vote on this and hopefully we can stick together and make a stand.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8253.266s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8253.586s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8255.208s">Did</a>  you want to speak?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8285.472s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8288.399s">I'll</a>  forward you the breakdown. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8290.521s">It</a>  was a page or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8291.942s">I</a>  don't believe it was.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8294.904s">From</a>  what I heard, what happened was, after being told the street was going to be fixed this year, it's not. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8304.471s">This</a>  year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8305.651s">That's</a>  true. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8306.232s">That's</a>  right.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8307.253s">Mr.</a>  President, I think you may be correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8309.474s">And</a>  the street was not included in that expenditure request that came forward as being funded through another <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8315.398s">process,</a>  and from what I understand, now, I'm pretty frustrated about the 7th Street thing, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8321.842s">You</a>  know, we're looking at this 24, maybe 36 months now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8324.783s">It's</a>  been going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8326.144s">You</a>  know, it's going out to bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8327.085s">It's</a>  going to be out to bid in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8328.205s">Well,</a>  the bid never got awarded in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8331.127s">Then,</a>  you know, work's going to start, you know, May, June. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8333.468s">Well,</a>  now it's August. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8334.349s">Work</a>  still hasn't started. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8335.869s">So</a>  I'm a little frustrated with the situation as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8337.67s">But</a>  the answer to your question, no, it wasn't included in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8340.672s">It's</a>  being funded through a different mechanism and a</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8343.128s">Well,</a>  I have it in front of me just to go through the through the list. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8347.452s">Grove</a>  Street and Linden Street, new water mains, 830,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8350.034s">Power</a>  Street and Pinkert Street, new water mains, 790,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8352.216s">Hydraulic</a>  model citywide, 30,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8353.057s">Water</a>  meters, 150,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8353.557s">MTU,</a>  75,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8353.857s">225,</a>  project is 350 in the 125 in enterprise budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8355.799s">Private</a>  lead service replacement was 200,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8371.677s">It</a>  goes into more detail, and then it says the contract is broken down as follows. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8377.86s">Year</a>  one, $1,298,445.09, water service and water main replacement as followed, and then Evans Street is listed under water main replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8388.505s">So</a>  there's no construction of the road within this, but Evans Street, they do plan on.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8393.327s">This</a>  year?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8396.642s">year</a>  one of the contract, so I think that would be 2017, beginning of 2018, if I can recall.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8403.646s">So</a>  how are they going to do that work in the winter? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8407.408s">Exactly.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8408.109s">And</a>  how can you say that they're going to do water main repair without, I mean, to get to the water main, you have to dig up the street, so obviously.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8415.633s">That's</a>  why they have to resurface the street, because they want to dig it up to make the water main surface.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8419.835s">That</a>  was always the plan, we were just hoping it would be repaved by now.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8423.295s">What</a>  happened was the contract got awarded, Mr. Capucci, and then when the engineering department said that these should construction schedule new construction criteria, they said we can't meet those criteria, so you have to re-bid the construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8434.992s">So</a>  they backed out of the deal after they were awarded the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8438.377s">But</a>  from what I understand, they weren't one of the preferred vendors that the city uses anyhow, so the product that they put out isn't necessarily one of the better ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8447.003s">But</a>  based upon the public bid laws, that's who we were stuck with. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8449.225s">So</a>  although it's been taking a long time, the delay may be a blessing because from what I understand, the workmanship of that entity isn't necessarily the best of the best.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8458.311s">I</a>  don't know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8460.212s">It</a>  being a blessing, Councilor Knight, the residents on my street, knowing that I come to a lot of the city council meetings, they have been asking me for months now.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8470.819s">Mr.</a>  Cappuccio, I'm in full agreement with the residents on your street that know that I come to a lot of city council meetings, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8475.321s">Call</a>  me and say the same thing.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8476.602s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8476.902s">I</a>  do not. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8478.663s">I</a>  do not hold this council accountable for the street and road repair on Medford Street pertaining to this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8488.326s">It's</a>  been decades since the street has been serviced. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8491.927s">I</a>  speak tonight in favor of Councilor Lungo-Koehn's resolution to have the specificities on future appropriations outlined because <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8506.571s">The</a>  administration put out a letter that in good faith these councillors looked at and then notified the residents on my street, who for years have been wanting Evans Street to be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8519.638s">And</a>  I think it was appropriate for you to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8522.52s">But</a>  then along the chain of departments that it has to go through, the engineer's office, the purchaser's office, then out for bids, then back to the mayor to choose the bids. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8537.375s">It</a>  was a serious ball dropped. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8539.896s">I</a>  wish the residents on my street weren't told that it was going to be done in May. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8544.878s">But</a>  I hope that you stand resolved to hold whatever administration is in power to doing simple things like street and road repair, especially when it's gone for decades neglected. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8563.727s">In</a>  a city that through different accounts I mean I sat through all the subcommittee meetings on on the budget and I see how expenditures not paid get thrown back into the general fund to where it's now ballooned into tens of millions of dollars and <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8578.698s">and</a>  to tell any resident of it, the people that came up before on brokers or curbs, go up Adam Street on the hillside, go on any street up in the heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8590.153s">For</a>  this city to be sitting on so much money in simple things like road repairs, I'm thinking done, it's done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8599.206s">It's</a>  a little disheartening for lack of a better term. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8601.45s">I</a>  hope that you all vote in the affirmative on Councilor Brianna Longo's current excellent resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8607.722s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8972.809s">item</a>  doesn't have to make the agenda if we don't have the information that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8976.632s">Just</a>  because the mayor sends a paper and says, put this on the agenda, it doesn't have to happen the next week. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8980.375s">We</a>  control our own agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8981.316s">We</a>  control when the items and matters come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8983.278s">So</a>  if we get a paper that says, put this on the agenda, we say, well, let's talk about the council, but when do we want to put this on the agenda? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8989.042s">Maybe</a>  we have six papers that are coming up for bonds. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8990.964s">And</a>  let's talk about bonding for a whole meeting and have a universal picture of what's going on in the city of Medford in terms of bonding instead of doing it <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8998.43s">play</a>  and connect the dots.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=8999.53s">So,</a>  you know, there's different ways that we can handle this.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9067.206s">Yes,</a>  Stone and Skillet, Mr. President, is located on the corner of West and Winthrop. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9071.61s">It</a>  is a bakery wholesaler that over the past several months has not been the greatest of neighbors, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9079.396s">I've</a>  received a number of complaints from area residents concerning their hours of operation, the cleanliness of the facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9087.501s">and</a>  some parking concerns that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9089.142s">Ultimately,</a>  this bakery wholesaler has operated in excess of our hours of operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9095.483s">They're</a>  permitted to operate from 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9098.204s">to</a>  11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9099.804s">Between</a>  May 1st and June 22nd, I personally reported 16 violations of operation after hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9110.587s">This</a>  coupled with the fact that there's a dedicated parking spot beside the building for 30 minute parking which has turned into stone and skillets personal loading zone for their renter car, renter truck, 18 wheeler that sits there for 7 to 8 to 9 to 10 hours a day without moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9127.634s">The</a>  facility and the grounds around it are in deplorable condition, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9133.296s">And</a>  I'm asking for these materials so that we can move forward and investigate whether or not there's anything that we can do to designate them as a public nuisance and move them out of the neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9143.284s">So</a>  it's been brought to my attention in recent weeks since I filed this resolution that a gigantic for rent sign has been placed on the side of the building which would lead me to believe that Stone and Skillet is on their way out of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9156.153s">The</a>  bakery wholesale does not fall under the jurisdiction by state law of our local Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9160.714s">They're</a>  controlled by the state Board of Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9162.534s">So</a>  we have very limited recourse concerning our concerns about the cleanliness of the facility and what's going on around it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9170.456s">However,</a>  with this good news coming forward that they are putting the place up for rent, I'd still ask the paper to move forward and for us to be prepared, because they said they were gonna move last year, they said they were gonna move the year before that, and they haven't, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9181.638s">They've</a>  certainly outgrown this facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9184.739s">And</a>  I think it's time that they find a new location. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9187.981s">Whether</a>  that location is in the city of Medford or somewhere else is to be determined, Mr. President, but right now I think that these residents have been subjected to enough quality of life issues down there that the benefits that Stone and Skill are bringing to the community are lacking and the impact on the quality of life that they have is major. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9205.595s">And</a>  for that reason, I bring this resolution forward and ask my council colleagues to support it.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9237.59s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9238.971s">A</a>  few months ago, well, not even, I don't think, probably June, I brought up a City of Boston ordinance that was regarding gas leaks, level three gas leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9253.939s">And</a>  the City of Boston is taking measures to hold the utility companies accountable and to remedy those gas leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9262.14s">in-depth</a>  ordinance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9263.241s">I</a>  did forward it to the city clerk who I then saw forwarded it to the rest of my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9268.343s">So</a>  this is almost just a reminder to maybe hopefully take a read and we can do something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9273.606s">This</a>  issue was brought to me by a citizen who probably is going to speak on it, Mr. Tudin. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9278.528s">And</a>  I think it was led in Boston by a group of moms who are trying to prevent gas leaks because of all the damage they do to you can... The gas bill? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9288.674s">The</a>  gas bill, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9289.754s">But</a>  it's a safety issue and it <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9292.719s">wildlife</a>  and the environment, it's not a good thing and we'd like to see what they're doing, read about it and hopefully craft our own ordinance to accommodate our needs and hopefully get the city engineer on board and give her a tool to make sure that when a street is dug up, gas leaks are looked into and fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9314.033s">So</a>  I would hope that we can review and come up with an ordinance sometime in September so we can move approval on this.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9320.927s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9322.088s">President,</a>  we have a paper from the mayor tonight that I think addresses part of this issue, Mr. President, that is being taken up by the State House to address it on a state level by creating an act relative to protecting consumers of gas and electricity from paying for leaks on unaccounted gas, which will of course force <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9350.711s">the</a>  gas company to deal with leaks because it gets them where it counts, in their pocketbooks, because that's what it's all about. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9358.576s">Mr.</a>  President, I don't know if this has to go to Committee of the Whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9362.418s">I</a>  would think that procedurally the best thing to do would be to send this to the Committee on Ordinances. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9368.162s">to</a>  review the draft of the Bardston ordinance to ask the city solicitor to be in attendance at that meeting to add his expert legal advice and then report it out as is often outlined by the proper procedure by Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9384.712s">Councilor</a>  Langlois-Carrion, would you prefer this go to the subcommittee and audiences?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9389.274s">I</a>  think it's a good ordinance the way Boston has it written. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9392.015s">I</a>  think it just requires a review, and the city solicitors sit with us as an entire body, which is going to end up in Committee of the Whole anyway. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9399.418s">I</a>  don't think it has to be redrafted in much a way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9403.579s">I</a>  think Committee of the Whole meeting would be preferable to move it forward quicker rather than take months and months to <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9411.58s">get</a>  two meetings set up. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9412.36s">I</a>  think we can do it in one meeting.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9437.825s">And</a>  I think somebody might want to speak on it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9475.966s">Thank</a>  you for that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9478.543s">17-598,</a>  offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the Director of Purchasing provide the City of Medford Council with an update on the implementation of the Wage Theft Ordinance, and be it further resolved that the Director of Purchasing provide the City, provide the Council with a list of all vendors awarded contracts for fiscal year 2017 and 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9502.574s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9503.534s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9505.795s">Back</a>  a few months ago this council passed a wage theft ordinance, and a wage theft ordinance is designed to ensure that taxpayer dollars that are being paid to public contractors are then passed on to their employees pursuant to the public wage laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9519.408s">What</a>  happens a lot of times in these instances is an individual that works for a private contractor that lays pipe, for example, with all these groups that we had this evening, that's working on a public works project laying pipe, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9530.769s">is</a>  going to have to be compensated at the prevailing wage rates established by the Department of Industry. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9536.512s">And</a>  a lot of times what happens is when a private contractor gets a public contract, they continue to pay their employees at a rate that's far less than the prevailing wage rate, and then they pocket the difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9547.097s">And</a>  the laws are clear in what they call for. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9550.158s">They</a>  call for individuals working on a public work project to be compensated at the prevailing wage rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9554.879s">Taxpayer</a>  dollars are being funneled away from workers and being funneled into the pockets of profiteers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9560.08s">So</a>  we passed the wage theft ordinance, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9562.32s">Part</a>  of the wage theft ordinance called for the city to examine whether or not any of the existing contracts have been included on the disbarment list at the Attorney General's office or found in violation of any wage and hour laws that are established at the state and federal levels. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9577.703s">ordinance</a>  is now up and running and in effect, Mr. President, I'd just like to get a report back from the administration as to what steps they're taking to implement and whether or not any of the contractors that we've awarded contracts to have actually been found in violation of any of the state of federal wage laws or have been included on the state disbarment list so that they're exempt and precluded from bidding on future public works projects, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9599.248s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9603.94s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9605.362s">David</a>  McKillop, 94 Rockland Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9607.004s">My</a>  question to Councilor Knight is, does this also include, in the initial part of it, when they actually put the bid out, they usually put in a labor amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9617.837s">That</a>  labor amount could be ballooned. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9621.441s">In</a>  the respect of an hourly versus an hourly wage, so it I'm not sure if a contractor city contract is the same But in general contracts when contractors come out and they do work The labor amount is based off of what they're charging for a labor amount some some places could charge 45 some places could charge 75 Some places could charge $80 per hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9640.214s">It's</a>  irrelevant to actually what they're paying the employees Does that also encompass that?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9645.473s">The</a>  Wage Theft Act just ensures compliance with the existing wage and hour laws. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9650.457s">And</a>  it requires the applicant for the public bid to make certain disclosures to the community so that if in fact they are found in violation, then they have to take certain steps to ensure that if a complaint is brought forward to them, that they have bonded funds that are available to cover the payroll if in fact they have funneled or diverted this money from the worker and into the coffers of the business. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9674.595s">So</a>  it doesn't really necessarily speak to the actual total amount of the bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9678.836s">What</a>  it does is say if you have seven people that are designated as a municipal street sweeper, you need to pay the municipal street sweeper rate of $37 an hour for the hours that they work on the contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9689.519s">And</a>  you're gonna work the contract for this many hours, so that's the rate that you have to pay them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9693.52s">And</a>  the rate's established by state law, by the Department of Land and Insurance.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9698.421s">So</a>  that protects the actual employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9700.282s">That</a>  protects the employee from having to wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9701.742s">It</a>  does not protect the city from a ballooned rate.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9704.343s">Well,</a>  the rates are established through the Department of Labor and Industries based upon the region that you're in.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9707.625s">For</a>  the employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9708.225s">For</a>  the workers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9708.566s">I'm</a>  talking about the actual bid itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9709.826s">Well,</a>  the bid process is the... There's nothing in there that would actually help.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9712.028s">Right,</a>  the public bid laws are relatively specific, and the city's ability to go and put restrictions in that would exceed the requirements that are established by state or federal law is not available to us.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9722.834s">Okay,</a>  that's what I understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9723.955s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9724.095s">All</a>  right, so in other words, we couldn't come in and say, you cannot go any further than 15% above the actual rate that you're paying per employee. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9732.52s">So</a>  basically that's where the companies would actually take the additional amounts and funds as opposed to the areas.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9738.845s">Or</a>  say you work a 40 hour work week, but you really worked a 60 hour work week and they paid you 40 hours at straight time and then the 20 hours under the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9751.093s">Or</a>  say that you worked a 40 hour work week, a straight 40 hour work week and they only paid you at your previous rate from the job that you were working on a public work project and that rate is <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9761.233s">50%</a>  less than what you should be making when you're working on the public work project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9765.256s">I</a>  think that that's some of the ‑‑ it's really an effort and attempt to get some of these unsavory contractors that do business in municipalities out.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9774.221s">I</a>  guess the reason why I make that point is because if they're being <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9777.403s">enforced,</a>  which is great, and it's an absolutely important point, then the contractor themselves will find their way to make their money anyway, and that's kind of where they're going to find their way, is the labor ballooning actually in the first part.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9790.315s">Well,</a>  the thing that they like to say in the industry, which would be called the change order, I believe they call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9794.078s">I</a>  think that's a code for more money.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9823.223s">First</a>  of all, I want to say thank you to all of you, and I know it's been a long evening, so I will not try to take up too much of your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9835.269s">But</a>  I did want to address the councils. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9840.711s">On</a>  Friday, August 11, the incumbents and the candidates for the Medford City Council were invited to <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9846.494s">present</a>  or be present to witness the city clerk and three members of the Registrars of Voters Department draw the names of the primary election ballot to be held on September 12 while we were all together all Candidates had agreed and signed a letter addressed to the City Council to the attention of President Caraviello to place our request on tonight's agenda and <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9869.998s">We</a>  are proposing with the city council's approval to waive the primary and request a homeroom petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9876.104s">I'm</a>  here to state that yes, we all have the right to the democratic process, but in this particular situation, I believe the money spent for a primary can be utilized in a much more productive manner. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9889.176s">There</a>  is one additional person on the ballot that requires the city to have a primary. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9893.759s">What</a>  amplifies the democratic process more than for all candidates to have equal opportunity on the day of the election? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9902.732s">A</a>  primary will cost anywhere between $35,000 and $45,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9906.275s">And</a>  I, for one, do not want to add additional expenses onto our taxpayers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9913.26s">For</a>  those who believe the money has been allocated for the primary, then why not utilize <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9919.474s">in</a>  different areas, such as education, public safety, drug prevention programs, or simply towards the maintenance of our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9928.098s">I</a>  am here to be on record with full disclosure and transparency as a candidate of the Medford City Council and a resident of this city to respectfully request the Medford City Council vote on waiving the primary and submitting the request of our home rule petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9945.185s">I</a>  do have the letter. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9946.826s">I'm</a>  not sure if you are all aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9950.019s">I</a>  do have a copy of the letter that was signed by all eight candidates, and I'll be more than happy to give it to all of you.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9957.226s">I</a>  think I think I think they all have it.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9960.508s">Do</a>  you all have a copy of this?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9961.85s">It</a>  should go out the packet this week.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9964.612s">This</a>  should be there.</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9969.757s">Mr.</a>  President, if I may.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9972.319s">I</a>  guess the question that I have, I guess the question that I have is the president is <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9977.266s">this</a>  letter that has been signed do all eight candidates still stand in support of it?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9987.567s">I</a>  put the motion on with the agreement that all eight candidates supported. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=9994.731s">One</a>  candidate notified me on Saturday that they did not want to continue on it, which prompted me to withdraw the motion.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10004.636s">We'll</a>  share.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10006.677s">Would</a>  you be willing to disclose, Mr. President, which candidate? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10008.978s">I</a>  will not. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10011.643s">We</a>  know it wasn't Ms.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10012.704s">Conyo.</a> </p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10013.685s">Conyo,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10014.546s">And</a>  for the record, if there were eight candidates, I guess I have a question. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10019.15s">If</a>  there were all eight candidates that had signed that letter, then I think we all had the respect to know who had decided to withdraw because everyone has the right to make their own decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10031.082s">That</a>  decision was not made by me, and I believe I have two other candidates here. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10036.387s">that</a>  the decision was not made by them. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10039.19s">And</a>  for the record, we do have a letter with our signatures on it that still are saying we would like to waive it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10045.956s">And</a>  again, if we're going to give everyone the respect that they decided to change their mind, then I ask this committee to give me the same respect of not changing my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10059.98s">And</a>  I also have the letter with the three of us who had decided or we never changed our minds.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10067.807s">Point</a>  of order, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10069.848s">Point</a>  of order, Councilor Del Rosario. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10077.066s">Mrs.</a>  Cuno, the matter has been disposed of.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10079.687s">And</a>  again, I just want to be on record because it was assumed that I was part and the other two members of the candidates that were running were part of that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10090.369s">We</a>  were not the part of that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10093.23s">It</a>  had never been discussed with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10095.05s">It</a>  had only been discussed to waive the primary. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10097.791s">So</a>  as I know, with all due respect, I understand that you've made your decisions, but I also want it very clear <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10104.592s">And</a>  on record that I was not for a primary.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10108.056s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10108.477s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10110.919s">The</a>  issue of a primary election has been something that's been heard in rumblings and rumors around the city as to whether or not we should have it, whether or not there are going to be enough candidates to have it, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10120.029s">And</a>  the idea of waiving the primary <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10123.305s">It</a>  can make sense, it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10125.646s">It</a>  certainly makes sense to save money, but then we also have to think philosophically about the way government works. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10131.309s">We</a>  have to think a little bit more about what dictates why a primary election is supposed to occur. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10136.352s">I,</a>  for one, came forward and stood with several of my colleagues against a home rule petition to change our charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10145.997s">I</a>  stood with my colleagues and I said, I think that this is something that the voters should address. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10150.059s">Right</a>  now we have a charter that dictates the way our election should work. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10153.082s">If</a>  we're going to change that document, that that document should be done by the initiative petition process and should be done from the ground up based upon the will of the voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10162.122s">So</a>  I'd have a very difficult time this evening supporting a paper that would waive the requirements of a primary election because the primary election is dictated and outlined in the charter of our community, the document, the blueprint, the constitution of how we're supposed to run our government. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10177.305s">So</a>  I'd have a very difficult time waiving the primary. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10180.006s">I</a>  guess it's a moot point at this point because Councilor Caraviello has withdrawn the paper and there's no paper that's before the council this evening addressing that issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10187.467s">However,</a>  I can certainly see the benefits of it and the financial <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10194.21s">However,</a>  the question comes as to what's more important, process or the funds? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10202.096s">And</a>  I would have a very difficult time if this paper was still on the ground today to vote to waive the primary election, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10209.524s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10211.085s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10212.125s">Robert</a>  Capucci, 71 Evans Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10215.587s">I</a>  was one of several candidates who reconsidered this letter that we signed on Friday during the day of the lottery, a letter <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10226.153s">that</a>  was just hastily written. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10228.234s">It</a>  wasn't notarized. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10229.634s">It</a>  wasn't written under perjury or penalty going back on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10235.555s">Considering</a>  the costs, I mean, I've been coming to these city council meetings for 10 years and I've been asking for costs to be redirected. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10244.858s">And</a>  these are monies that are gonna be allocated and spent elsewhere, whether it's on the primary or not. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10251.799s">The</a>  money essentially is already gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10254.866s">Essentially,</a>  it's already gone. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10256.388s">I</a>  wasn't the only candidate who reconsidered. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10259.332s">I</a>  don't want it to be presented tonight that just one person, because we... I was only notified by one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10265.94s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10266.68s">I</a>  don't know who else. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10268.483s">And</a>  here we are tonight, notifying you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10272.577s">on</a>  after discussion from some of the candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10276.081s">It</a>  wasn't hidden from other people who signed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10281.566s">It</a>  was presented that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10283.488s">But</a>  with all due respect, the prior speaker was texted on Saturday and informed.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10290.556s">I</a>  don't know.</p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10291.997s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10293.218s">I'm</a>  just saying it in full disclosure because I don't want it to be portrayed or perceived that anything was covertly done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10302.826s">In</a>  considering not having a primary, I mean, the weight of denying citizens an election is something, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10315.756s">Something</a>  that weighed heavy on my mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10317.678s">So</a>  I thought about it and I reconsidered speaking for myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10321.403s">I</a>  am not obligated to to have to disclose reasons <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10328.472s">why</a>  I reconsidered are two people. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10331.513s">I</a>  am 47 years old. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10334.154s">I'm</a>  an adult. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10334.854s">I</a>  can make my own decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10336.294s">I</a>  reconsidered based on discussion with a sitting council member, as a matter of fact, and I won't mention any names. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10344.676s">So</a>  I'll just say that it made better sense and it was better judgment and it was better part of the democratic process to have an election and let the voters decide and <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10358.54s">Full</a>  disclosure, I'm just up here tonight letting you know that everything was above board. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10364.022s">It</a>  was a simple thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10365.943s">I</a>  greatly respect you for bringing that home rule petition.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10373.186s">And</a>  I think I explained to everybody on Friday what signing that meant. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10378.168s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Robert Cappucci]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10379.649s">And</a>  I understand that, but things happen and people change their mind. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10384.471s">People</a>  change their mind all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10385.491s">It's</a>  non-binding. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10387.832s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10388.112s">Your</a>  mind changed as well at times. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10391.575s">I</a>  don't think we should deny an election to the citizens of Medford in a primary.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10396.239s">And</a>  there will be no denying of anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10398.281s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10403.705s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Ray Scarfo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10407.408s">Ray</a>  Scalf on 9th, Sunset Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10409.941s">I</a>  just want to bring the timeline in to everybody that was notified back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10415.346s">So</a>  I was the person that brought forward to all the other seven candidates about not having a primary. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10422.051s">With</a>  the direction of the Council President Rick Caraviello, I contacted all of the seven candidates on the matter, on the cost to eliminate one candidate for a primary election. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10435.362s">Because</a>  of that thought process, all candidates agreed to sign a statement on Friday, August 11, to not have a primary. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10445.726s">On</a>  Saturday, August 12, President Caraviello called me and said he spoke to one of the new candidates who reconsidered his position wanting to have a primary. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10457.19s">Because</a>  of that conversation, President Caraviello told me he was withdrawing the home rule petition to cancel the city council primary. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10465.46s">I</a>  then proceeded to text all the new candidates about President Caraviello's to withdraw the motion of the Home Rule petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10473.767s">On</a>  Monday morning, President Caraviello informed me at the coffee shop he was not going to withdraw the motion of the Home Rule petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10483.956s">I</a>  then proceeded to inform again all seven candidates that Council President changed his mind and not to withdraw the Home Rule petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10494.816s">Getting</a>  confusing? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10497.537s">I</a>  asked all candidates if they would be willing to sign a document saying they wish to have a primary and to respond to me as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10508.123s">I</a>  myself, having given considerable thought and receiving feedback from other candidates, along with some citizens, feel that the citizens have the right to have an election and to follow the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10525.783s">And</a>  as Councilor Knight said, as I remember two years ago, there was an issue on a charter review and certain Councilor, Councilor Knight, made a statement that the citizens that wanted a charter review should follow the process and not send it to the state legislatures. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10545.736s">Again,</a>  who am I to stop that process on challenging a primary? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10551.243s">There</a>  were men and women who have served and died to give us that right to a fair election. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10556.786s">I</a>  had a cousin who died at the Battle of the Bulge, and an uncle who received the Bronze Star and Purple Heart in World War II, and me, who served seven years in the military. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10566.71s">After</a>  listening to fellow veterans along with concerned citizens, I don't want to see that right given away and demean their memory. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10575.937s">We</a>  also discussed the cost of our last primary two years ago for city council to eliminate one candidate. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10582.261s">That</a>  process of election went forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10586.803s">This</a>  year's cost, would it really be a savings? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10590.505s">It</a>  would be just to move the money to the general fund or the free cash account spent elsewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10597.109s">It</a>  wasn't gonna be earmarked for anywhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10598.59s">They</a>  could spend it anywhere they wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10602.535s">Personally,</a>  I would not like to see the primary canceled. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10606.396s">I</a>  believe in the right to have a fair election. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10609.996s">That</a>  was given to us by the men and women that fought for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10614.757s">And</a>  I do have four names signed on a notary.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10621.899s">It's</a>  a move point anyway.</p>

    <p>[Ray Scarfo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10624.419s">I</a>  know it's a move point, but we do have four names that did <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10629.146s">We</a>  don't need them.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10636.313s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10636.693s">The</a>  matter has been disposed of.</p>

    <p>[Ray Scarfo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10637.694s">I</a>  just wanted to make the record straight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10639.856s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10642.299s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10643.72s">Vice</a>  President Mox.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10645.261s">Just</a>  if I could, Mr. President, because there's been a lot of discussion around this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10649.782s">And</a>  I can tell you firsthand that, in my opinion, when we talk about conflicts of interest, about having a vested interest in something, and how we as a legislative body should remove ourselves, I have a real problem with elected officials canceling elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10668.468s">I</a>  have a real problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10670.108s">I</a>  think that's probably one of the most unethical things that <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10676.348s">uh,</a>  honest with you, and to also do it in the name of savings, to me, is just a smokescreen. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10683.411s">Because</a>  first of all, there is no savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10685.832s">And</a>  secondly, Mr. President, when you look at the budget, and if you want to make a savings, the tax pays and the rate pays in this community have been paying for peg access, which they haven't had for four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10698.043s">It's</a>  not the way you save in a $160 million budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10722.035s">and</a>  even non incumbents and incumbents have a vested interest in the process, we should be involved whether or not an election is canceled. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10729.922s">And</a>  our city charter dictates what should happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10733.365s">Double</a>  the office plus one, you have a primary. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10737.809s">Now</a>  we're trying to circumvent the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10740.411s">No</a>  matter how you cut it up, we're trying to circumvent the process of allowing residents of this community to get out and vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10747.757s">Now</a>  I realize a primary election <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10749.878s">from</a>  previous elections, probably 10 to 12 percent turnout. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10753.78s">And</a>  I know that's probably around 4,000 voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10755.501s">And</a>  that is a lower turnout. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10757.822s">But</a>  how do you say to 4,000 voters, sorry, we don't believe that this primary is important enough? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10764.345s">We</a>  don't believe your right to get out and vote is important enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10768.747s">I</a>  don't understand that, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10770.527s">I</a>  really can't fathom that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10772.068s">And,</a>  you know, EFDE here, why are the city turnouts so low? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10776.696s">You</a>  know why? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10777.557s">Because</a>  of these things, these type of things, Mr. President, when we have low turnout and we want to gather interest in the community, and the quickest way to put a fizzle on that is to do away with elections. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10789.871s">Think</a>  about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10791.212s">We're</a>  trying to build up elections in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10793.433s">This</a>  council has asked to promote elections by putting banners out and A-frame signs and other social media to get elections out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10801.116s">And</a>  here we are saying, that's canceled the election. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10804.017s">It</a>  just doesn't make any sense to me, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10806.978s">It's</a>  not a savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10808.398s">That's</a>  a red herring. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10810.88s">This</a>  is all about, Mr. President, about affording the right to people in this community to get out and vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10816.927s">And</a>  even if it's just one person that wants to get out, Mr. President, I'm going to support their right to get out and vote.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10822.434s">There</a>  is no motion on the floor, Mr. Vice President.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10824.076s">I</a>  know there's not, but there's been a lot of discussion around this, and I want to let people know where I stand on this, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10829.765s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10831.067s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10910.268s">There</a>  was nothing to be informed of.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10911.65s">But</a>  I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10912.25s">Everybody</a>  else is saying that they've texted and spoken to everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10915.013s">I'm</a>  just going through the question. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10916.314s">Move</a>  the question, please.</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10917.916s">Point</a>  of order, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10919.938s">Point</a>  of order, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10921.64s">There's</a>  nothing to be informed of because there was nothing official. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10925.304s">So</a>  again, that was an agreement amongst the eight candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10929.108s">So</a>  it had nothing to do with the City of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Ann Marie Cugno]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10931.368s">You're</a>  absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10932.389s">But</a>  there are other people up here that said the president went to Parliament procedure.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10936.15s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10937.751s">I'd</a>  like to make a call for the orders of the day, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10940.933s">The</a>  paper that's the discussion that's being held before us is attached to a paper that's been disposed of already. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10945.835s">The</a>  paper has been disposed of. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10946.876s">Continue</a>  this discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10947.836s">We</a>  can do it during the public decision in the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10950.278s">But</a>  we do have some agenda.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10955.36s">Oh,</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10956.201s">I</a>  didn't speak at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10957.041s">Someone</a>  twice.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10959.081s">They</a>  were allowed to do that.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10960.522s">Hi,</a>  Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10964.044s">Apparently</a>  the game is afoot, but I hope that this is the last thing that we're gonna have.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10968.546s">The</a>  motion has been disposed of, so there is no other discussion on it.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10972.048s">No,</a>  not on this side of the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10975.189s">Let</a>  her finish, let her just, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10977.21s">It'll</a>  be faster, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10978.991s">But</a>  I just wanna say that when I was approached about not holding a primary and then about holding a primary, I insisted that all candidates be notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10988.036s">I</a>  wasn't notified about a paper that was signed for people coming here tonight that didn't want to have a primary. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=10994.738s">So</a>  I just caution everyone that all the candidates, we should be working together because theoretically, we all want what's best for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11002.641s">So</a>  I hope that there isn't any backroom deals. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11005.422s">When</a>  I was approached by candidates, I did speak to them about what's best.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11009.223s">So</a>  for the record, do you want to waive the primary?</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11013.462s">I</a>  didn't have strong feelings about it either way.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11015.183s">Oh,</a>  because I'm looking at the letter and your name's on it and I just wanted to figure if that was okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11019.626s">That</a>  was all, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Cheryl Rodriguez]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11020.567s">So</a>  I thought that everybody put forth solid arguments about it and we're going to have an agreement amongst your eight candidates. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11028.693s">Exactly.</a> </p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11083.383s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11084.144s">Excuse</a>  my appearance. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11084.984s">I</a>  had a bad injury at the bike path that doesn't exist in the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11091.857s">The</a>  formula for a primary, I believe, is seven positions for the city council, which you all hold, times two is 14, add one is 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11100.622s">If</a>  there's 15 or more candidates running, and there are, I believe, triggers a primary according to the city ordinance or charter. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11113.37s">Is</a>  that accurate? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11114.11s">That</a>  is correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11114.991s">Thank</a>  you, sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11121.011s">I</a>  on on when when Mr. City Clerk Finn had the drawing for the post positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11131.579s">I</a>  did sign as a council candidate for this election, a so called document. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11141.487s">I</a>  believe all eight of us signed it of the challenges I should say. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11147.716s">And</a>  that's the only document I ever signed to that nature. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11151.718s">And</a>  the document was stating, I believe, to let's waive the primary and save the taxpayers $30,000, $45,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11161.402s">I</a>  hear sometimes $70,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11164.383s">I</a>  don't know what the actual figure is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11167.984s">So</a>  I said, sure, it makes sense to me, common sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11172.452s">that</a>  why spend $30,000 to $45,000 to eliminate one out of the 15? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11179.773s">And</a>  God forbid someone gets eliminated, if there is a primary, that person's not going to feel very happy, I presume. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11188.915s">It</a>  seems like a lot of big chunk of cash to eliminate one person. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11193.876s">However,</a>  if you put it in perspective, as Councilor Marks was alluding to, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11202.551s">45,000,</a>  when this city spent, first of all, they collected from our pockets, the taxpayers, a billion dollars, over a billion dollars, not including the bonds they borrowed and extended our debt, the public debt. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11219.942s">And</a>  from real perspective, I believe the 45,000, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11227.578s">is</a>  two hundredths of 1% of this year's $167 million budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11237.983s">Furthermore,</a>  bottom line, this might be the best $45,000 this city has ever spent in 55 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11246.347s">It's</a>  going to open up some conversation, I would think. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11249.089s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11249.889s">You're</a>  welcome. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11250.57s">I'm</a>  not finished. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11253.987s">And</a>  maybe we can get some leadership that can improve our situation in the city and lower our real estate taxes, et cetera, et cetera, and improve the quality of life. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11269.556s">So</a>  frankly, Charlotte, have the primary, don't have the primary, it might be a good thing to spend that $45,000 after all. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11277.561s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11278.301s">You're</a>  quite welcome, sir.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11280.654s">Motion</a>  to revert back to regular business. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11282.655s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11282.875s">17-599</a>  offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn be it resolved that the Energy and Environment Office provide the City of Medford City Council with an update on test boardings behind the Andrews School and Clippership Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11295.041s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11296.182s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11297.822s">Just</a>  wanted to reach out and hopefully get a written response from Energy and Environment, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11303.665s">Hunt.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11304.566s">I</a>  know she was working hard on this project and it was <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11308.237s">Unfortunate</a>  what was discovered on Clippership Park. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11312.74s">We</a>  also as a council asked that there be test pourings done on at the Andrews School. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11318.385s">So</a>  I want to make sure that's one of my two reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11321.127s">Obviously</a>  we want an update, but I want to make sure that those test pourings were done behind the Andrews School where hundreds of children play during school hours and play soccer on the weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11331.895s">And</a>  I just want to make sure that that soil is not contaminated. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11335.383s">So</a>  I move approval on this and ask for a written response.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11338.4s">Councilor</a>  Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11339.301s">Mr.</a>  President, I think this is a good resolution and I second the recommendation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11343.683s">Ultimately,</a>  we just this morning, I should say this morning, it feels like this morning, but a little earlier in the evening, we had a presentation by the Massachusetts Area Planning Council and our Office of Community Development concerning the master plan for Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11356.211s">And</a>  that plan focused a lot on the Clippership Connector. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11360.714s">So</a>  I think it's very important moving forward, since we have this draft plan for the Medford Square that they're looking at, that we understand what's going on over there environmentally. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11368.358s">on</a>  the Clippership Connector because that seemed to be a major part of connectivity between the square and other parts of the city.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11375.604s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11376.605s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Lungo-Kearns, seconded by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11380.008s">All</a>  those in favour?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11381.309s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11381.769s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11383.47s">$17,600</a>  offered by Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11385.332s">Be</a>  it resolved that the DPW repair the pothole in front of 12 Golden Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11389.735s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11390.796s">Thank</a>  you, Steve Tanaglia, Brian Cairns, and the members of the Met for DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11395.519s">I</a>  placed a phone call and put this matter on the resolution on the council agenda, but because we're meeting sporadically over the summer, the issue was taken care of in 24 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11404.425s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I withdraw the resolution and I thank the DPW for their prompt and quick response.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11410.369s">Motion</a>  by Councilor Knight to withdraw 17-600. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11415.597s">17-601</a>  offered by Councilor Lungo-Koehn be it resolved that the final fiscal year 18 budget be posted online in detail and that any candidate for office be allowed to review and receive such a copy of such. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11431.211s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11432.312s">Thank</a>  you President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11433.993s">I</a>  learned about a week ago that there was a candidate for office who couldn't get the budget book for fiscal year 2018. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11441.844s">which</a>  was passed and approved the end of June. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11445.006s">And</a>  I was surprised. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11448.228s">So</a>  I just want to make sure that any candidate, anybody, any person who lives in the city who wants to review the budget can do so online or go to the city clerk's office and read a hard copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11458.955s">And</a>  any candidate should be able to, or the mayor's office, wherever that may be, to be able to review the budget in detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11465.839s">I</a>  think it's essential to, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11469.269s">transparency</a>  obviously but it's just essential to know what is in that budget where the money spent it's like we just spoke about 160 plus million dollar budget and I really feel that every every candidate and resident in the city should have access to it.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11485.066s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11490.908s">I'm</a>  under the impression that it is posted and that especially the devotees of the budget process, the citizen participants who are often there year after year to participate in the budget, receive one.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11510.005s">There</a>  is a hard copy available now, if I'm not mistaken.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11513.326s">Yeah,</a>  we got a hard copy this week.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11514.306s">I</a>  don't know when it was made available. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11516.746s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11518.066s">I</a>  do believe, Mr. President, the public records law would dictate the provision of public documents to individuals in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11523.627s">That's</a>  the state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11524.928s">I</a>  find it nonsensical for the council to think that they can move forward and put more stringent requirements on something that's already been established by a higher governmental jurisdiction.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11537.11s">If</a>  I may, through the chair, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11538.696s">I</a>  believe the detailed budget that we were given in June with specific information, very detailed information, not all of that is online. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11548.671s">I</a>  feel like that should be open to the public.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11552.318s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11554.198s">David</a>  McKillop, 94 Rockland Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11556.619s">I</a>  do want to speak on this point because I was the one who was actually trying to get my hands on a budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11563.72s">I</a>  did go in two consecutive weeks in a row to try and get my hands on a budget towards the end of July and was met with a little confusion as to why it wasn't available throughout the actual city hall itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11578.243s">I</a>  know that the City Clerk tried really hard to figure out how I could get my hands on one. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11583.024s">The</a>  City Assessor did put a little effort into it and was reverted back to the Mayor's Office to find a copy not available. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11590.987s">I</a>  did ask if I could get it online. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11593.067s">It</a>  was met with <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11595.368s">the</a>  young lady that actually tried to help me with I don't know anything about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11599.271s">All</a>  I know is that the budget is out to print. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11602.093s">Now,</a>  in my impression, you want to talk about transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11605.815s">If</a>  you have passed a budget and that budget is enacted the first week of July, every single citizen, not just candidates, every single citizen should be able to get it at any point immediately because if you're working with a budget and that budget is operating, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11619.744s">that</a>  means it should be in our hands period. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11621.866s">That</a>  is not transparency. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11623.568s">That</a>  is not what this administration is showing in the regards of one of the most simplest documents for that reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11632.775s">So</a>  I strongly suggest that this time next year when a budget is being presented and passed, it is ready to go July 1st because everyone should have it in their hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11643.805s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11644.466s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11776.285s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11778.306s">We</a>  haven't met in a few weeks, so last week I was <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11783.302s">I</a>  received a number of complaints with regards to the cleanup and the splash of almost cement on the business owner's facade and a number of issues with regards to potential handicap accessibility issues down in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11800.673s">And</a>  it's very concerning. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11802.815s">I</a>  did reach out to the mayor's office. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11804.756s">I</a>  know a number of us have been making calls and trying to get in touch with MassDOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11811.534s">I</a>  know people have been calling Representative Donato, but as a council, I would like to take a vote that we ask that this cleanup be done in a better way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11823.112s">At</a>  the end of the night, a restaurant or <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11826.134s">whatever</a>  businesses are down there, they should be able to operate with a clean, friendly environment where a wheelchair can pass through or a mother with a stroller to get into a restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11838.023s">And</a>  from the pitches I've saw, I'm extremely concerned. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11843.126s">I</a>  know that, unfortunately, really nobody from the administration has been down there often. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11849.371s">Thankfully,</a>  our new <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11851.272s">commission</a>  for persons with disabilities, our new diversity director did go down this week. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11857.378s">I'm</a>  not sure he found anything not in compliance, but there was a few days last week where I saw the ruler to the door and it just <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11867.645s">It's</a>  very concerning, so I would ask that we, as a body, take a roll call vote to ask our state delegation to get involved.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11874.13s">If</a>  I can interject, I have spoken with Representative Leader Donato, and he is in the process of arranging a meeting with the state delegation.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11883.678s">Great,</a>  great.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11884.359s">If</a>  you want to send them an official letter, but he was notified, and he is in the process of doing that.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11890.104s">If</a>  we could just vote to support his endeavors in trying to help that location.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11894.673s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Longo-Kearns, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11899.017s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11899.677s">Mr.</a>  President, I, too, got the same phone calls that the Councilor refers to. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11904.721s">And</a>  I've had conversations with the project manager, Mike Winnick, as well as Dan Fields, the DOT contact and liaison. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11912.527s">And</a>  it's been brought to my attention that probably the start of September, all the work's going to transfer to the other side of the bridge.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11918.872s">Oh,</a>  thank goodness.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11919.512s">All</a>  the public utilities are going to be able to be moved. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11921.393s">That</a>  was the side of the bridge that had the most significant amount of public utilities underneath it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11925.594s">That</a>  was the side of the bridge that was going to be posing the most trouble and complications during their, what seems like once in a while construction that they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11936.097s">And</a>  come September 1st, it was my understanding that they would be moving to the other side of the street and all the work done in front of Carol's restaurant and the Zamferelli building and so forth would be complete.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11948.897s">So</a>  it looks like the sidewalks are pretty much all done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11950.78s">They're</a>  all put today on the last couple of days.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11954.465s">Mr.</a>  President, but if I may, I think that maybe in terms of the direction we're going and calling the state delegation and telling them to do something, why don't we have the state delegation tell us what they're doing and see if that's something we want to support. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11965.301s">So</a>  maybe it might be nice for us to have a conversation with the representative and the representative share with us what efforts that they're taking to see if that satisfies us as opposed to standing in line.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11973.449s">He</a>  is in the process of setting up a meeting with the delegation and he said he would have an answer to me probably in the next week or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11981.058s">So</a>  maybe and we'll get a meeting.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11983.1s">Why</a>  don't we just ask to be invited to the meeting that he's setting up.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11986.348s">We</a>  will be at that meeting.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11990.791s">Vice</a>  President Mox. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11992.312s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11994.173s">The</a>  meeting was a meeting that this council voted on and requested. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=11998.055s">And</a>  it was my resolution to ask that the state delegation be present. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12003.018s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12003.278s">And</a>  also that the primary conversation be surrounded by not really what's taking place over there, but mitigation.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12010.183s">I</a>  informed the representative about that.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12011.984s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12013.305s">and</a>  the impact it's had financially on these businesses. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12017.488s">I</a>  realize the area is in disarray and some of those businesses have been going through this for two years now, but what is the state going to do regarding the business loss <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12029.539s">You</a>  can't bring, when it's lost business, you can't bring it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12033.245s">And</a>  in my opinion, Mr. President, the state needs to step forward and we as a city need to step forward on behalf of our businesses that have been impacted by this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12042.578s">That's</a>  a state bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12044.681s">It's</a>  in the city of Medford, but it's a state bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12047.222s">We</a>  hear all too often, oh, we can't do this on a state road, or we can't do anything regarding tree trimming or sidewalk repair or street repair on state roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12058.485s">Now</a>  we have a state bridge, Mr. President, and we have no say in what's going on in a bridge in the heart of our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12065.407s">uh,</a>  which makes absolutely no sense to me at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12067.688s">But,</a>  uh, that, uh, meeting that we have is to discuss mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12072.309s">That</a>  is correct.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12072.95s">That</a>  is what I told him.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12073.65s">To</a>  discuss how we're gonna make these businesses that have been impacted financially for the last two years whole again, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12079.952s">You</a>  are, you are 100% correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12082.433s">And</a>  that, and that is what, when I, uh, when I, uh, had an official meeting with him, I did tell him that the, that your motion was for, for mitigation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12091.516s">And</a>  he understood that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12094.905s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Longo-Kearns, seconded by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12098.846s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12122.421s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12125.204s">And</a>  a lot can happen in 18 months. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12127.706s">As</a>  the corner office transitions to a new administration, we saw former Mayor McGlynn reach his 50th wedding anniversary. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12137.694s">And</a>  we also have seen his daughter bring another grandchild into the world for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12142.338s">So</a>  I'd like to take a moment to congratulate Amanda and Patrick on the birth of their first child. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12146.862s">They've</a>  just purchased their first home as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12149.004s">and</a>  I think it's a great momentous occasion to see a family that's five generations in Medford continuing to stay in the family and hopefully have a sixth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12156.43s">So</a>  with that being said, I just hope my council colleagues would join me in congratulating Amanda McGlynn Collins and Patrick Collins on the birth of their first child, Ella McKenna Collins.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12283.713s">Yeah,</a>  I noticed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12284.494s">I've</a>  been through a thousand times. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12285.755s">I</a>  get distracted, and it costs me dearly. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12288.798s">I've</a>  had injuries and broken bones. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12293.608s">If</a>  I had some power in this, I would be the first on the agenda that I would take care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12299.472s">It's</a>  public safety, not just that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12301.693s">Mystic</a>  Avenue, cars that should not be parked there when five lanes becomes two lanes.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12305.575s">I'm</a>  talking about new roads, Mystic Avenue.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12307.857s">Yes,</a>  we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12313.58s">In</a>  a nutshell, Andrew Castagnetti, 23 Cushion Street, 781396. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12322.573s">TIPS,</a>  T-I-P-S. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12326.056s">This</a>  new growth, we've had this for many, many years, probably every year since pre-my birth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12334.445s">However,</a>  I don't understand why we don't use this new growth, which basically is real estate tax that never existed before from a development. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12348.605s">Why</a>  don't they use that new growth to offset Prop 2.5 increases? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12355.711s">Directly,</a>  it should be directly applied to Prop 2.5 increases. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12362.116s">I</a>  don't understand why. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12364.118s">Two</a>  years ago, I did the math, my real estate tax bill went up $400. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12371.063s">If</a>  they apply the $1.5 million of new growth, brand new real estate taxes, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12376.813s">against</a>  the 2.5%, which was $2.5 million, it would have went up $80 instead of $400. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12383.755s">And</a>  this has been going on since before I was born. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12391.638s">Basically,</a>  I believe this new growth, it should not be encouraged the way it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12399.3s">I'm</a>  for smart growth, great economic growth. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12406.58s">If</a>  you don't use that new real estate tax to offset two and a half increases, not only does it hurt us, it hurts us fivefold. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12419.565s">First</a>  of all, you need more fire, police, school teachers, buildings, vehicles, and infrastructure improvements. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12432.109s">It</a>  doesn't make sense to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12434.17s">I'm</a>  asking, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12436.477s">If</a>  you could formally ask the mayor for an answer, a formal answer, because I've tried on my own with the head of the city assessor's office, and I have not received a straight answer, although I was told he would mail me something. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12458.445s">That</a>  was three months ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12460.005s">I</a>  understand I'm not tech savvy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12462.506s">Snail</a>  mail can take time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12465.313s">But</a>  it's been three months. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12467.354s">Could</a>  you please, can one councilor make a formal request to ask the mayor, why aren't we using new growth to offset prop two and a half increases? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12483.981s">Sure.</a> </p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12485.382s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12514.983s">Amended</a>  by Councilor Langlois-Carrion that the mayor give an answer why the new growth money is not applied to the taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12524.207s">Is</a>  that correct, Mr. Kesey? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12526.108s">Yes,</a>  sir. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12526.768s">To</a>  the two and a half taxes.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12528.349s">To</a>  directly offset any proposed part two and a half increase. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12533.411s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12536.997s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Langlois-Carrion. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12539.699s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12540.68s">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12541.36s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12543.081s">17-609</a>  Communications from the Mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12546.945s">Mr.</a>  President, City Council, I respectfully request and recommend that Your Honorable Body consider the attached resolution in support of House Bill 2683 and Senate Bill 1845. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12558.934s">Unrepaired</a>  gas leaks not only emit dangerous gases into the air we breathe, but the cost of this gas, this lost gas, is passed on to the consumer. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12568.242s">Please</a>  support this measure on behalf of the citizens of Medford.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12575.957s">I</a>  think we discussed this in substance, apparently.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12581.642s">We</a>  did?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12583.024s">It's</a>  a little different.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12584.565s">It's</a>  a little different than what, this is actually, as the gas and electric company do, not charge us for the energy use.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12595.195s">Mr.</a>  President? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12598.238s">I'd</a>  like to amend the paper to be added as a co-sponsor. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12601.717s">And</a>  if you could add, Mr. Clay can you be the one that has to read it? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12606.361s">I'm</a>  sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12606.581s">Can</a>  you make me be the one that has to read it? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12608.243s">Do</a>  you want me to read it?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12650.697s">I</a>  think this is worthy, although I'll be quite frank with you, I haven't read both bills, but my only question I had was regarding if we're going to require them not to charge the <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12667.073s">the</a>  homeowner, which I think is a novel concept. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12670.797s">And</a>  I assume that would require them to then, on their end, start fixing these leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12678.125s">Ultimately,</a>  who's going to end up paying for this? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12681.705s">Um,</a>  and I, I'd like to hear from someone, uh, you know, stating, I don't know, maybe Mr. Tudin can answer that, but, uh, ultimately, I would assume they're going to pass that off to ... The consumer.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12694.374s">The</a>  consumer. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12694.734s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12695.374s">Um</a>  ... So we don't pay one way or another. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12697.176s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12697.376s">So</a>  secondly, Mr. President, and it's good, uh, you know, we have, uh, level three leaks, which, uh, they, they don't even look at level three leaks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12704.761s">They</a>  only look at level one and two leaks, uh, in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12708.583s">I</a>  would also ask, Mr. President, an issue that I've been talking about for years, that the mayor supports looking at unaccounted for gas and making a savings to the gas payers so they're not paying for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12721.508s">And</a>  I would ask the mayor respectfully, why doesn't she look at unaccounted for water <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12726.79s">which</a>  every single ratepayer in this community has been paying through the nose for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12732.714s">It's</a>  roughly 20 percent. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12734.595s">It's</a>  millions of dollars, Mr. President, of unaccounted for water that we're all paying for. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12740.558s">So</a>  I realize the mayor is hip on this and wants to see the people have a savings. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12746.342s">I</a>  would hope she'd also like to see <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12748.483s">The</a>  people have a savings on unaccounted-for water, which has been a real major concern for many, many years in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12755.827s">Cost</a>  and the rate pay is millions of dollars, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12759.169s">So</a>  I'd like for that to accompany this paper in asking her what her thoughts are on unaccounted-for water, because there's ways, as a community, we have over $7 million in the water and sewer enterprise account that we can address unaccounted-for water. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12774.677s">So</a>  there are ways, Mr. President, that we can <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=12778.931s">look</a>  out for the ratepayer in this community regarding water.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13114.052s">What</a>  is the question? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13115.053s">Would</a>  you like to move? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13115.874s">Receive</a>  and place a fat. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13116.916s">Receive</a>  and place a fat. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13118.598s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Naita, receive. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13120.961s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13121.502s">If</a>  I could, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13123.185s">The</a>  petitioner was here at our last meeting in July. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13128.089s">The</a>  hour grew late. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13130.011s">He</a>  asked that it respectfully be laid on the table. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13132.974s">The</a>  petitioner had a death in his family, Mr. President, and he would respectfully ask that it continue to be laid on the table, Mr. President, so he can come up and speak on it.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13144.521s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13145.722s">And</a>  like I said, Mr. President, it's more of a procedural issue than anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13148.485s">I</a>  feel as though it's something that should be done in the public participation process of the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13152.029s">That's</a>  not something that can be filed at the beginning of the next meeting and be put on the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13157.034s">It</a>  doesn't have to be something that sits on the table for the entire period.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13159.357s">Again,</a>  like I said, it did go to the last meeting at a very late hour.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13165.002s">And</a>  they did ask that we... I just have a little bit of a concern, Mr. President, about the way that the petition process is being used and not necessarily maybe in the right way or in the right frame. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13175.805s">I</a>  think the petition process is starting to become overly politicized. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13179.866s">And</a>  a lot of these items that are being brought up through petitions should really be done during public participation.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13184.408s">Where</a>  it is already on the agenda, I feel that we should just keep it there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13187.148s">I</a>  withdraw my motion, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13188.549s">We</a>  currently don't have the support. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13193.37s">Okay,</a>  we have one last one offered by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13197.557s">Be</a>  it resolved that the City Council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13200.253s">congratulate</a>  Mr. and Mrs. Adam Knight on celebrating the eighth wedding anniversary. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=13204.976s">Councilman</a>  Scarpelli.</p>
