    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2173.804s">A</a>  couple of days. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2175.605s">A</a>  couple of days.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2177.687s">Do</a>  you know when it's going to begin?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2179.928s">As</a>  soon as this is granted, we'll have the contractor go in and pull the street opening permit.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2185.19s">Do</a>  you know how many sidewalk panels are impacted? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2188.672s">Just</a>  so the residents in the neighborhood have some sort of idea.</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2191.374s">I</a>  think there was maybe 37 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2193.695s">I</a>  think there was maybe five panels. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2196.656s">Give</a>  or take a couple.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2198.022s">And</a>  will there be any impact with regard to traffic in the neighborhood?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2202.244s">I</a>  would say no. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2203.045s">I</a>  mean, I don't know if there's a lot of pedestrian traffic in the sidewalk there, but they can put some traffic control signs there to block the sidewalk and divert them around. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2213.35s">And</a>  it's basically pretty much almost a day or two's work for the most part once they excavate it all out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2221.134s">And</a>  then the biggest part of it will be going back and replacing the concrete. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2225.756s">That's</a>  what's going to take the time.</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2228.154s">Mr.</a>  President?</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2230.135s">So</a>  it's strictly sidewalk work? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2231.715s">No.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2232.075s">Yeah,</a>  nothing in the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2233.255s">And</a>  what materials are used to replace the sidewalk panels, the same existing? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2235.976s">Same,</a>  yes, it's concrete.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2237.757s">Councilor</a>  Scott, go ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2238.917s">I</a>  think that I echo Councilor Knight's, one of the biggest concerns we've had in this council in the last couple of years, two years that we've been on set. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2246.959s">that</a>  whenever there's a utility company that comes in, the way they found the street and sidewalks in a better condition than, if the same or if not better condition, than it was left, because we have a huge issue with contractors coming in, representing the utilities, and then leaving sub-par work behind, and then the city is left, and the constituents are left holding the bag, so I think that it's very important that that piece <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2278.526s">discussion</a>  with the city's engineer making sure that the most approach.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2284.929s">Mr.</a>  President also looks here that the petitioner has agreed to remove an asphalt patch that's been put around another existing utility pole as part of mitigation to help fill those gaps with concrete to keep it consistent with the rest of the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2297.113s">So</a>  I have no problem with this petition. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2299.494s">Mr.</a>  President, I move for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2301.055s">Second.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2366.843s">Okay,</a>  so this is a conduit build. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2370.485s">I</a>  guess we're starting on Granville Avenue at the railroad right-of-way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2375.848s">We're</a>  replacing a handhold and we're constructing 200 feet of conduit to a manhole location at the location of Winchester Street and Granville Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2385.494s">Then</a>  we're constructing another 722 feet to another structure, a manhole structure. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2391.977s">And</a>  then from that, we'd go out to a Verizon manhole that's actually in the city of Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2401.715s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2402.315s">I</a>  have a lot of questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2404.437s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2406.659s">So</a>  on Broadway, there's a bridge that crosses over the railway. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2413.404s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2413.944s">And</a>  in order for them to replace that bridge for the Green Line Extension Project, we have to relocate our cable, which is running right down the right of way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2424.272s">And</a>  the way to do that is to get it up <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2426.974s">into</a>  the Verizon structure and then take it from the Verizon structure down Winchester, down Granville, and get it back onto the railway beyond the bridge where they're doing the construction.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2435.991s">Tell</a>  us about the type of conduit that you're going to be building. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2439.192s">Is</a>  it a contained concrete tunnel?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2442.634s">Is</a>  it a... It's typical construction with two four-inch conduits encased in concrete, 48 inches of depth down. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2453.019s">And</a>  obviously, we're going to be looking to mitigate intersecting with anything else that might be in the roadway.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2458.869s">And</a>  are you going to be digging in the road and the sidewalks? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2461.972s">All</a>  on the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2462.832s">And</a>  what kind of wiring is this?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2466.495s">So</a>  what would go back, what we're relocating is a fiber optic cable for AT&T. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2470.999s">OK.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2670.494s">So</a>  will there be someone on site who's going to be available and consistent to just help these people who really feel beat up at this point?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2680.018s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2681.239s">Siena</a>  will definitely have somebody on site while the contractor is working. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2684.82s">And</a>  who is Siena? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2686.061s">Siena</a>  is an engineering firm and we're representing AT&T. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2689.582s">So</a>  basically we will work with a contractor that will be on site.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2693.724s">Good,</a>  good, good.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2696.525s">Thank</a>  you Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2697.405s">Councilor</a>  Falco.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2698.125s">Thank</a>  you Mr. President and some of the similar similar questions I guess but you know as far as that the length of time this project is going to take and when do you think this will begin just so if anyone here that was watching at home tonight.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2711.028s">So</a>  what we're trying to do is get this done before December is our goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2716.91s">Before</a>  the moratorium we'd like to get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2718.91s">We're</a>  still working out this grant allocation as well in Somerville and as soon as we get that we're going to get underway so <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2726.372s">We're</a>  in the process of putting all the pieces together. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2728.453s">We'd</a>  like to get started as soon as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2730.815s">And</a>  we're looking at, depending on how things go and what the impact is in terms of traffic, it would be four to six weeks, I would think. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2738.959s">But</a>  that's the outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2741.501s">I</a>  can't say exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2743.022s">It</a>  depends on how long it takes us to get underway and if we run into issues in terms of traffic or if you have special events or any of those things. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2752.027s">that</a>  might be impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2753.309s">I</a>  don't know if there are road races scheduled for the next couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2757.593s">When</a>  we could get out there and get it done.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2759.555s">And</a>  as far as the, so would the work hours be just your normal 9 to 5?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2763.58s">Yeah,</a>  it would be. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2765.341s">And</a>  if we were going to do anything, or if we were looking to get some relief on that, we would obviously come to the city and ask if we could do that.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2773.51s">And</a>  as far as the impact to the neighbors that live in that neighborhood, are we talking about they're not going to have access to their driveways? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2781.053s">What</a>  will be the impact and how will they be notified?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2783.574s">I</a>  think it would be minimal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2785.654s">Obviously,</a>  where we're working, it may take a day for us to get out of the way of a driveway, for instance, but we'll be looking to keep <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2793.797s">pedestrian</a>  traffic moving at all times, keep roadways open as much as we can, and keep driveways open as much as possible.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2802.625s">So</a>  will you be, you know, sending a notice to the neighbors? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2806.068s">I</a>  mean, just to let them know the driveway could possibly be not accessible, you know, during these dates?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2812.174s">We</a>  certainly could do something like that if we needed to.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2815.256s">I</a>  mean, I would think, you know, just I think it's a good idea just to let them know, you know, that this project is going to happen and, you know, just so they're informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2823.56s">I</a>  mean, because I think the worst thing is when there's no communication, that's when the phones start ringing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2829.522s">that,</a>  you know what, I knew nothing about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2831.683s">You</a>  know, the person that might live in the street might not know nothing about or anything about this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2837.185s">They</a>  might have minimal information, but then all of a sudden they can't get into the driveway, and they're calling us for answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2842.387s">So</a>  I think reaching out to the community, to those streets that are impacted and those neighbors that are impacted, it's definitely something that <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2849.99s">I</a>  would recommend.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2850.971s">Yeah,</a>  and I believe we did send out a listing and mailing already. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2854.394s">Okay,</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2856.636s">But</a>  once we get started, we can do that again. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2858.958s">And</a>  I know one of the stipulations was that we get together and sit down before we get started. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2864.002s">And</a>  we will have a schedule at that time where we can tell you what we think it's going to take us to get it done.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2870.648s">Great,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2871.208s">And</a>  as far as the, do you foresee any road closures at all?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2875.792s">the</a>  way that we have our traffic plan set up right now there are no road closures so we're not we don't anticipate that there would be actual road closures.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2883.138s">Okay</a>  I'm just concerned where if you because I think this this if I'm reading this map correctly this leads out to Broadway right?</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2889.464s">It</a>  does yeah.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2890.184s">So</a>  I'm just concerned that if you if you're closing a road in Somerville and <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2896.172s">The</a>  residents in Medford don't know anything about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2898.713s">There's</a>  a disconnect there, so if there are any road closures, you know, I would think that, you know, if we could just make sure that the residents know, just because the worst thing is when something insurmountable is impacting them and they don't know anything about it, you know, that's something that we should keep into, you know, take into account.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2915.717s">Yeah,</a>  absolutely, if you look at the traffic plan, I don't think we're, we're not planning on closing any roads and we obviously would like to try to keep traffic moving in all directions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2924.96s">And,</a>  you know, setting up the proper traffic plan and also getting some help from both police departments to make sure that we can keep traffic moving, that's the goal. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2934.664s">Okay,</a>  thank you very much.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2938.725s">Actually,</a>  I think my questions have been asked and answered.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2940.966s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2942.847s">This</a>  is what it looks like, what, 948 feet of trench work that you want to do? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2946.469s">I</a>  think it's about almost 1,100 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2948.91s">Almost</a>  1,100 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2950.11s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2951.411s">You</a>  said something at the beginning of your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2953.012s">You</a>  said this is going to be common trench work like you see all around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2956.653s">And</a>  we've had a big problem in this city about trench work that's being performed by public utilities in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2962.539s">Just</a>  last month we had a committee of the whole meeting with the city engineer and we asked a series of questions to the city solicitor as to whether or not we could place a moratorium on trench work. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2970.546s">One</a>  of the big problems isn't necessarily you guys getting in there and doing the work that you need to do because you need to get the work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2975.491s">It's</a>  never coming back and fixing it to the standard that we want to see it fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2979.614s">That's</a>  become a very big problem in our community We're seeing a number of streets in residential neighborhoods the end and main roads alike, but again pulling up and torn apart I mean if you look at tonight's agenda for example We got 115 feet coming up after that and we're looking at 2,000 feet of trench work that we're gonna be putting through the city You know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2997.518s">I</a>  mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=2997.739s">There's</a>  applications for 2,000 feet of trench work in the city and we have some questions that are pending right now before our <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3004.0s">Solicitor</a>  that I think I'd feel a little bit more comfortable getting an answer to before I move forward and supporting this paper You know a thousand feet a lot of a lot of stretch on the end It's ten football fields councillor de la rusa was absolutely right that neighborhood has been beat on for the last three four years between you know the reversals of Winchester Street in the direction that it's going in and <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3023.665s">the</a>  impact that the expansions of the Harvard Street Bridge have had, the discussion about eminent domain land takings coming up in the near future to, again, accommodate the extension of the Greenland, which I think is going to be a benefit to our community, don't get me wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3036.86s">I</a>  think the Greenland extension is a good thing for us here in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3039.503s">But</a>  in the meantime, we have residents that really need to maintain a strong quality of life, and that hasn't happened in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3045.048s">So</a>  this evening, I'm having a very difficult time supporting this paper, Mr. President, if we don't have the answers that are going to come back from the city solicitor based on the committee of the whole that we had. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3053.977s">And</a>  the committee of the whole meeting that we had was exclusively focused on trench management and the issuing of permits to public utilities and what they do to our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3061.023s">and</a>  whether or not they come back, and whether or not there's a schedule for them to come back, and whether or not we can limit the number of permits that are issued in a quarter or a year, so that we can better manage the job and better oversee the job that's being done, because I think that the focus is more on the next special permit than it is on coming back and completing the work from the last special permit that you got. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3078.686s">Now,</a>  I haven't had the opportunity of working with Siena, and I'm not sure what Siena's reputation is or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3083.747s">I'm</a>  sure you guys are great. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3084.727s">You're</a>  working for AT&T, which is a multinational company, you know, a billion dollar company, so I'm sure you guys do a great job. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3090.408s">But</a>  we need to do some housekeeping here, in my opinion, before I feel comfortable supporting this paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3096.271s">And</a>  I'm not going to be able to support it this evening, Mr. President, for the reasons that we've asked a series of questions to our city solicitor through the administration, asking for some input and some feedback as to what we can do to better manage the trench work that's being done in our community, because it's killing our streets, it's killing our neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3111.7s">And</a>  the residents are speaking out against it in this particular street, in this particular neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3116.702s">They've</a>  been under the thumb of construction for the better part of three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3119.984s">And</a>  it's not going to stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3123.106s">And</a>  the work needs to get done, I understand.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3124.427s">Yeah,</a>  unfortunately we're on a schedule here where we're getting forced to relocate because we're in the way of the apartment that's going to go in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3134.032s">And</a>  this is the way to get around that so that they can do that construction work. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3138.815s">that's</a>  what's pushing us to get this work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3142.296s">I</a>  understand that it's a cause and effect situation, I guess you'd call it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3145.957s">Well,</a>  we're on the right of way, and we happen to be on the right of way in the wrong spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3151.498s">We're</a>  at the apartment where the bridge needs to be replaced, and this is the way to get around that so that they can move forward with their construction in December.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3158.94s">In</a>  this alternative here that's being presented, I would assume would be the least costly alternative to the provider, right?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3165.682s">I</a>  don't know if it would be the least costly, but it certainly is.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3169.964s">Is</a>  there another way you can do it? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3171.044s">We</a>  don't have to dig 1,000 feet in one of our city streets, I guess is the question.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3174.745s">I</a>  don't think that there is another way that we could do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3177.406s">I</a>  don't know that we could get our cable out of the way of the construction.</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3180.827s">You</a>  might be able to speak to that a little bit better than I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3184.008s">Derek</a>  Anderson with our design professional representing MBTA 16 Myrtle Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3189.531s">So</a>  I understand some of the trenching problems on a personal level. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3192.993s">But</a>  to why I'm here, yeah, we have, the design team has looked at multiple different ways to keep the relocation of this particular duct bank within the MBTA right away under the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3207.281s">There</a>  is not a way that we have seen where we're able to avoid any disruption to the public streets in the area, the Boston Ave or Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3216.535s">Winchester</a>  seems to be the best possible alignment for getting in and out quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3222.202s">And</a>  yeah, we've looked at those. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3224.505s">To</a>  give some sense, Broadway Bridge, there's abutments coming down on either side, a new track. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3229.109s">There's</a>  just no space between the abutments and the track to put that in.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3231.972s">There's</a>  barely any space between U.S. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3233.213s">Travel</a>  World and, you know, from what they've done over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3235.915s">It's</a>  far away from the building, so I understand why you're not looking at it.</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3238.638s">We</a>  have absolutely looked to try to avoid disruption in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3243.262s">There</a>  isn't another way without getting into the roads.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3248.866s">Or</a>  can you go underneath the real bed? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3250.587s">Can</a>  you go through some holes?</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3252.708s">One</a>  way or another, it's got to come up onto the roads.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3256.39s">And</a>  really, Winchester is... And what do these conduits service? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3260.892s">Are</a>  they home telephones? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3262.133s">Are</a>  they internet IP? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3264.194s">Bandwidth?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3264.934s">What</a>  do they provide?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3266.215s">Yeah,</a>  it's AT&T's core... <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3269.996s">network,</a>  and it's carrying all kinds of traffic that is not only local, but it goes all over the place. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3281.16s">This</a>  particular cable has quite a bit of traffic on it that can't be rerouted, unfortunately. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3287.782s">The</a>  right-of-way was a place where they traditionally put a lot of network as a way to mitigate getting into town and city streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3298.471s">And</a>  unfortunately, where it is right now, we don't have the ability to get it out of his way while he builds the bridge. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3305.341s">And</a>  this is a way to work it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3307.624s">And</a>  we are taking advantage of some structures that are already there and going through, coming out of the horizon.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3318.116s">I</a>  appreciate you for answering my questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3319.497s">I</a>  don't think my position is moving much off of Mr. President, although the answer is from the solicitor's office.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3326.722s">I</a>  appreciate coming out tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3329.124s">I</a>  think that's one of the biggest things that we've talked about in this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3332.906s">I'm</a>  sorry that you have a representative of this feedback, but until we make a stand, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3340.711s">and</a>  really get the feedback back from the city solicitor and all of the utility companies that have been using our streets as trenches and then walking away and leaving our streets a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3357.37s">I</a>  think that with that and <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3360.493s">plan</a>  in place for those neighbors because those neighbors again, I echo the remarks of my colleagues that they've been impacted so negatively and They're just daily daily Lifestyles and to compound that with more construction road work without a comprehensive plan that they are familiar with from beginning to end I think would be <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3383.293s">would</a>  be negligent and my part as a city council representing those people to not make sure that those concerns are not just supported by yourself, but a plan that would show us and what we can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3401.545s">So</a>  I too would like to table this until we get more information from our city solicitor and what we've asked for in the past for our utilities <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3412.592s">to</a>  make sure that what's being done on our roads, that utilities are being held accountable for what they're leaving there.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3419.755s">Yeah,</a>  we'd certainly work with you guys on whatever you needed to be, you know, comfortable with our construction practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3430.639s">anything</a>  we'd need to do to help communicate with the neighbours, all the people that are impacted, we'd certainly be willing to do that.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3439.342s">And</a>  again, I apologize that you could be the one situation where it would leave the street impeccable, but when you have two foot swaths being cut and then you see them dip and nobody comes back to fix them and then <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3455.347s">Again,</a>  someone comes in and builds a four foot swap path and nobody comes back and this is what we are hearing over and over again. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3464.358s">And</a>  this is where it has been very frustrating for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3469.103s">So</a>  thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3470.385s">I</a>  appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3475.202s">I</a>  think some of the frustration you're hearing is regarding the number of projects that this city has gone through over the last couple of years. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3484.01s">Eversource</a>  right now will be trenching two miles of some of our major thoroughfares in the next several months, which is going to be a big disruption to traffic and residents in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3497.721s">My</a>  question to you is we hear all too often when we ask when a trench is dug and we all know after even with best intentions It usually sinks after a period of time and we've asked the city Solicitor why we can't request that when you're digging a trench that you've not only just paved the trench but <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3520.977s">but</a>  you do a curb-to-curb restoration. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3523.958s">And</a>  we're being told that we can't request that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3527.479s">And</a>  I believe it has something to do with state law, correct me if I'm wrong, but we can't request a curb-to-curb repaving. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3534.182s">And</a>  in my opinion, if I allowed you to dig up some of my driveway, to put something under my driveway, I wouldn't request that you just patch a little piece of my driveway, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3542.525s">Because</a>  I know what's going to happen in six months from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3544.846s">My</a>  driveway's going to be a mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3546.547s">And</a>  the same thing applies to our streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3548.888s">So</a>  that's the first thing I think we have to look at, why we can't request a curb-to-curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3553.45s">Was</a>  a curb-to-curb requested in this particular case?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3556.731s">It</a>  was not requested in this particular case. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3559.372s">You</a>  know, if you had something that was wrong with our patch, for instance, we certainly would want to try to restore the patch.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3567.736s">So</a>  if the city did request a curb-to-curb, would you</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3572.966s">That's</a>  something that I would have to bring back to see if that's something that would be an option. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3578.232s">That</a>  would certainly be quite a big impact to the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3582.678s">But</a>  maybe, I don't know if it's something that we could do. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3586.803s">I</a>  couldn't answer that question tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3592.11s">It</a>  would be a bigger impact overall to the neighborhood as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3596.497s">I</a>  understand that if we did have to do a full restoration for the entire trench, the trench line, that we would be looking at a pretty big impact.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3608.486s">For</a>  the neighbors and everybody the construction project would be bigger than it would be Sure sure residents who call us up in six months from now saying every truck that goes by their house shakes their house because it's such a dip <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3624.543s">You</a>  know, we hear it over and over again.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3625.944s">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3626.845s">So,</a>  I can appreciate the fact that... No, I understand that the roads are all over, you know, all over the state there's construction work going on and it's frustrating for everybody at times and patches to resettle and that's, there's no question about it that that happens. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3644.298s">I</a>  don't know that I can say that I'd be able to do a full restoration this evening, but I could certainly inquire about it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3651.142s">We</a>  don't meet again until September, third week in September. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3655.163s">Yeah,</a>  and my concern is that if we don't... We're not going to meet until the third week in September.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3660.106s">Right,</a>  right, and that's my concern is that, you know, with the project, with the goals that they have for the bridge, that we're running out of time to get this project done.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3671.911s">Well,</a>  I is one member of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3673.912s">I'd</a>  hate to hold up this project I understand that you're doing the project based on what work needs to be done, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3680.713s">I</a>  Would have no problem if you would be able to give us a commitment tonight about curb-to-curb restoration That way I think would be an easier sell to the neighborhood knowing that this work is taking place But the ultimate outcome will be a brand new area street from the whole length You know, we go through projects like this <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3701.498s">the</a>  EverSource project I mentioned two months, it has zero benefit to this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3707.28s">Zero.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3709.0s">I</a>  realize we all have to live together as good neighbors with other communities, but it has zero benefit to our community and it's going to have a thousand percent disruption to our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3717.803s">So</a>  those are the type of things I think we're struggling with.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3720.145s">Yeah,</a>  I understand.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3721.906s">I'd</a>  be supportive tonight if you would give a commitment. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3724.868s">If</a>  you can get on your phone, give a commitment for a curb-to-curb restoration.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3728.49s">Is</a>  that something that I could come back in, if I could get a few minutes and see what I can do?</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3732.333s">If</a>  the members feel the same, I feel that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3734.474s">I</a>  think that would be a win for our community if we were able to repave the entire area.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3742.187s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3743.207s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3744.108s">Mr.</a>  President, I wouldn't be so strict as to require that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3751.131s">I'd</a>  certainly invite it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3753.832s">I</a>  am intimately aware that neighbors, that's the neighborhood I live in. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3759.615s">I</a>  know what my neighbors have been going through and I've been working on this as the city's liaison on one of the city's liaisons on this Green Line Extension project for <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3772.524s">12</a>  years, 14 years, something like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3777.288s">And</a>  they're finally digging, they're finally going, and we want to get it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3782.472s">People</a>  want to see it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3785.746s">And</a>  so I wouldn't want to be part of impeding construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3791.851s">And</a>  I can only imagine that Winthrop Street will be dug up again. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3795.594s">And</a>  certainly our neighbors up there will be dealing with the ambient noise of ongoing construction for the next several years with the construction of the station. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3809.405s">the</a>  rail bed, and then also the continued presence of the lower line moving eight, what was it, 18, 27 feet closer to their homes, and then the squeaks and the clickety-clacks of the Green Line streetcars. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3829.404s">So,</a>  that being said, I, <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3835.047s">I'd</a>  like to see curb-to-curb restoration of the street, but I also know that that might involve its own inconveniences to the people, but my concern was chiefly on their having avenues of communication. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3853.242s">in</a>  a way to get assurances that the concerns are going to be met, but I'll gladly yield to my dear colleagues and support that, but I certainly don't want to, I don't see a need to table this tonight, nor do I see a need to withhold it. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3874.172s">and</a>  whole so I would like to move on it decisively tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3878.82s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3887.16s">Based</a>  upon your plans and construction guidelines and so forth, do you see a need to do any more underground work on Winchester or Granville before the completion of the Green Line extension?</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3896.442s">As</a>  part of this project, we're not anticipating utility work on Winchester or Granville.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3903.623s">Because</a>  part of the concern would be if we did go curb to curb, then that would put in effect a moratorium for digging. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3908.465s">So</a>  we require to go curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3911.245s">and</a>  paved the whole entire street, then we could say that they can't think for five years.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3914.446s">Are</a>  there other plans for other utilities to work through that area? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3917.806s">I</a>  don't know the answer to that question. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3919.387s">That's</a>  why it's better for them to do it the new way. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3921.727s">I</a>  see if that's the way to do it.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3923.668s">They</a>  did the water and gas, that was two years ago, three years ago.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3926.248s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3931.089s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3933.49s">I</a>  see everybody's frustration, and we've had a number of Committee of the Whole meetings to try to remedy it, and we are awaiting answers. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3941.146s">Curb</a>  to curb will be great, but for me, what I keep bringing up in the last several years that this has been a real problem is the fact that we don't have anybody from the city to review the trench work six months from now, a year from now. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3955.579s">So,</a>  I mean, I'd be amenable as long as we have a condition on there that <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3960.183s">engineer</a>  or somebody from the administration does a walk-through with somebody from your company nine months from now or a year from now and if there is sinkage that it be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3969.93s">I</a>  think that might be another option.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3974.153s">I</a>  think everybody touched some great points. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3978.075s">the</a>  more detailed agenda for our constituents and those neighbours that are going to be affected, I think would have to be something that's necessary.</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3989.583s">Yeah,</a>  we definitely are interested in that. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3992.305s">You</a>  know, I did talk to the city engineer and that was one of the points that she brought up is that we did have to meet before we got started. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=3999.27s">We</a>  were going to have a construction kick-off and I think we could address some of those concerns with the neighbourhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4004.513s">and</a>  I've actually been given the okay to do curb-to-curb if you guys would like us to do the curb-to-curb, so.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4010.376s">In</a>  the petition, it says AT&T shall provide a full-time resident engineer approved by the city who will monitor the work on the city's behalf. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4017.979s">AT&T</a>  will provide detailed scheduled weekly updates, so it is in our context somewhat. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4024.502s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4025.582s">So</a>  you just said that you've gotten the authority to do curb-to-curb?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4028.203s">I</a>  have, I've gotten the approval to do curb-to-curb if you guys would like to do it.</p>

    <p>[-8Uy-JvGvpg_SPEAKER_24]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4032.005s">Can</a>  I elaborate on my response? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4034.366s">Please.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4035.406s">As</a>  you know, this is a design build, so when I say that we're not anticipating any work there, I can't say that there won't be any work, because I don't know what the design build is that was proposed, but we're not anticipating work there.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4049.391s">I</a>  anticipate it, and the other question I have was would <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4054.998s">You</a>  have a pre-construction meeting, obviously, with our engineering department. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4057.361s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4057.881s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4058.702s">Would</a>  you be willing to have a pre-construction meeting at maybe the South Metro Fire Station with the same people that are the abutters that are on your abuttal list?</p>

    <p>[John Kennedy]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4064.709s">Yeah,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4065.61s">Why</a>  not? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4066.05s">You</a>  know, we certainly want to keep everybody happy. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4068.433s">We're</a>  interested in having good neighbors and keeping everybody as happy as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4072.958s">We</a>  are going to be constructing. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4074.279s">We</a>  are going to be impacting traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4075.761s">That's</a>  unavoidable. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4077.302s">but</a>  we're interested in getting the project done as quickly as possible with the least amount of disruption.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4084.083s">Mr.</a>  President, I think we're making good progress tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4086.024s">You</a>  know, a curb-to-curb solution is something that... So it's just my agreement that you're agreeing to a curb-to-curb? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4093.925s">Yeah,</a>  we're in agreement. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4095.166s">And</a>  so could we have that as a condition? <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4097.966s">If</a>  you could put that as a condition, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4099.967s">And</a>  just another condition that there's a meeting that's held for construction with the residents that are at Butters. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4104.688s">At</a>  Butters, Upper Butters.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4108.049s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4111.011s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Dello Russo, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4115.555s">As</a>  amended. <a href="https://youtu.be/7sg70fldaE8&t=4117.737s">All</a>  those in favor?</p>
