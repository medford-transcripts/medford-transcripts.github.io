[SPEAKER_00]: And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

00:00:18,504 --> 00:00:20,205
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,486 --> 00:00:28,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:32,274
[SPEAKER_02]: Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,694 --> 00:00:34,756
[SPEAKER_02]: And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:43,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, thank you for joining me today.

10
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:47,971
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could start just by having you introduce yourself, your name, pronouns, and just a bit about who you are.

11
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:48,811
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

12
00:00:48,971 --> 00:00:50,571
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Amelia Whalen.

13
00:00:50,611 --> 00:00:51,872
[SPEAKER_01]: My pronouns are she, her.

14
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,072
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a teacher at the Andrews Middle School.

15
00:00:54,092 --> 00:00:55,953
[SPEAKER_01]: I teach eighth grade ELA.

16
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:57,934
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been teaching in the district for five years.

17
00:00:58,014 --> 00:00:59,214
[SPEAKER_01]: I taught over at the McGlynn.

18
00:00:59,734 --> 00:01:08,237
[SPEAKER_01]: As a sixth grade ELA teacher for two years, I got switched over here during 2020, like with all the teacher shuffling, and I've been here ever since.

19
00:01:08,717 --> 00:01:09,057
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

20
00:01:09,137 --> 00:01:09,517
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

21
00:01:09,597 --> 00:01:18,060
[SPEAKER_03]: So before we get into talking more about your work, I was wondering if you could answer the question that we ask everyone, which is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what you like to eat there.

22
00:01:18,462 --> 00:01:24,444
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I really like going to Ronnie's and they have these little like garlic, garlic bites that are very, very yummy.

23
00:01:24,524 --> 00:01:26,405
[SPEAKER_01]: The Parmesan garlic bites I think is what they are.

24
00:01:26,425 --> 00:01:27,165
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very good.

25
00:01:27,185 --> 00:01:28,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had those for sure.

26
00:01:28,446 --> 00:01:29,006
[SPEAKER_01]: They're delicious.

27
00:01:29,026 --> 00:01:29,386
[SPEAKER_03]: They're delightful.

28
00:01:29,906 --> 00:01:30,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

29
00:01:30,286 --> 00:01:36,569
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've met each other because you do a project in your class where you have the kids

30
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:38,330
[SPEAKER_03]: do their own podcast.

31
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:44,635
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to talk about that a little bit, but also I would love to hear from you kind of what got you into teaching, how you got here.

32
00:01:44,776 --> 00:01:52,062
[SPEAKER_01]: So both my parents are teachers and growing up, I always said I did not want to be a teacher because of that.

33
00:01:52,082 --> 00:01:54,564
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I didn't want to be a teacher because both my parents were teachers.

34
00:01:54,664 --> 00:01:58,167
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was probably around junior year of high school, I realized that I loved

35
00:01:58,948 --> 00:01:59,828
[SPEAKER_01]: working with kids.

36
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:04,650
[SPEAKER_01]: I did speech and debate in high school and we coached middle schoolers as high schoolers.

37
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:09,451
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just, I loved seeing them grow and develop their skills.

38
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:13,573
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love also seeing them kind of blossom into who they were as people.

39
00:02:13,593 --> 00:02:18,734
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was kind of my first exposure at working with a middle school kind of demographic.

40
00:02:18,954 --> 00:02:20,255
[SPEAKER_01]: And then

41
00:02:22,317 --> 00:02:25,459
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I knew that that's what I wanted to do outside of college.

42
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:43,133
[SPEAKER_01]: So I began working as a pre-K teacher and then I transitioned into middle school and I just, I love, I love seeing kids become the best version of who they are and I love

43
00:02:44,575 --> 00:03:00,895
[SPEAKER_01]: I love talking to them about books and stories, that's why I love doing English because I think there's a safety in fiction and in literature where they can play out hypothetical scenarios and I think they can figure out how they would respond in a situation and try to kind of

44
00:03:05,392 --> 00:03:10,653
[SPEAKER_01]: gauge who they could be or would be in kind of extraordinary circumstances.

45
00:03:10,713 --> 00:03:16,115
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love the power of language and the ability to communicate your ideas and the power of your voice.

46
00:03:16,135 --> 00:03:34,280
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the reasons that I love doing the podcast project, because it's something that shows students and children of any ages that their voice, be it like a written voice or a spoken voice, their voice has meaning, their voice has weight, their voice has power, and their voice is important.

47
00:03:34,943 --> 00:03:41,969
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, one of the things I was like really impressed with when we met last year was the topic that your students chose around the dress code and the hats and hoods.

48
00:03:42,029 --> 00:03:49,335
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was thinking as you were talking about that idea of like seeing kids like kind of realize their best selves.

49
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:57,843
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could personally say that in eighth grade I was probably the worst version of myself, but probably because that was like there's a lot of sort of like questioning things and like challenging.

50
00:03:58,403 --> 00:04:03,125
[SPEAKER_03]: And that project to me was kind of like the best way to use that aspect of like an eighth grader, right?

51
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:08,707
[SPEAKER_03]: They're challenging something that I think on its face, lots of teachers might be like, well, this is the policy.

52
00:04:08,727 --> 00:04:09,407
[SPEAKER_03]: It is what it is.

53
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:16,610
[SPEAKER_03]: And like that project to me was really like, well, let's hear, let's hear why, why, like what, what you're coming up with, with why this is not a policy that.

54
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,951
[SPEAKER_03]: And in talking to those students, it seemed like that's what they were expecting.

55
00:04:19,971 --> 00:04:22,712
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, oh, teachers are just going to say, like, this is just the way it is.

56
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:28,894
[SPEAKER_03]: But it seemed like a really unique opportunity to really engage them in, like, something that they were passionate about.

57
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:29,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

58
00:04:29,595 --> 00:04:32,496
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this started for those particular students.

59
00:04:32,556 --> 00:04:38,738
[SPEAKER_01]: And just for context, the students, they wanted to challenge the policy that our district had on

60
00:04:39,158 --> 00:04:40,519
[SPEAKER_01]: wearing hats and hoods in schools.

61
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,782
[SPEAKER_01]: And this started in their civics class with Mr. Tremonti.

62
00:04:45,062 --> 00:04:49,605
[SPEAKER_01]: They were coming up with rules for their class's constitution and they wanted to challenge that rule.

63
00:04:50,466 --> 00:05:04,135
[SPEAKER_01]: And he talked them through the process of kind of understanding where a rule came from and why the rule was there and how the rule was made, as well as the process that they needed to go through if they wanted that reformation and change and

64
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:18,923
[SPEAKER_01]: It just bridged into this classroom and it was really, really cool to see them connecting ideas across different subjects because that's something that we often talk about with them in their classes.

65
00:05:19,023 --> 00:05:22,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we do CERs in English class, they do CERs in science class.

66
00:05:22,746 --> 00:05:29,369
[SPEAKER_01]: We write about claim evidence reasoning and when they can bridge the gap between two different subjects, it's really fun to see that happen.

67
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:41,999
[SPEAKER_01]: to see them take an idea they had in civics, bring it into ELA, and then push it outside of the school setting and go to a city councilor.

68
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:45,882
[SPEAKER_01]: No, sorry, not a city councilor, a school committee member to try and make a change.

69
00:05:45,922 --> 00:05:48,024
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really, it was really inspiring.

70
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:50,326
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was, it, it was something that

71
00:05:51,797 --> 00:05:58,179
[SPEAKER_01]: brought me a lot of joy and brought me a lot of pride, and it made me very excited about what they can do in the future.

72
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:03,881
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and not only did they do that, they helped kind of implement policy change, changing the handbook.

73
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember them getting a shout out in the actual school committee meeting.

74
00:06:07,843 --> 00:06:13,365
[SPEAKER_03]: But also their podcast was entered in the NPR Student Podcast Challenge, and they were runner-up.

75
00:06:13,465 --> 00:06:16,446
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so they were top 10 in the nation for middle schoolers.

76
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:21,328
[SPEAKER_01]: We as a class have done this project now for five years.

77
00:06:21,368 --> 00:06:32,833
[SPEAKER_01]: So my first year teaching in Medford, Medford, Medford was the first year that they ran this competition through NPR and we had kids submit

78
00:06:34,517 --> 00:06:36,818
[SPEAKER_01]: for a podcast the first year, I want to say.

79
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:42,320
[SPEAKER_01]: And one, one group got an honorable mention and it was their podcast on Dr. Seuss.

80
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:51,063
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did a little podcast about his life, his impact, and they interviewed kids, they interviewed teachers.

81
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:51,923
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really fun.

82
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:56,504
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next year the pandemic hit, so we didn't really get to do anything with that.

83
00:06:56,524 --> 00:07:04,107
[SPEAKER_01]: The year after we had another student receive an honorable mention for her podcast called COVID Conversations, where she

84
00:07:04,717 --> 00:07:15,559
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about connectivity throughout the pandemic and how it's really important to kind of maintain relationships, even if it's in a digital sense, like over the phone.

85
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:29,561
[SPEAKER_01]: And then last year we had students submit a podcast about wearing hats and hoods in school and they were selected as finalists, which was really beyond what I ever thought could have been accomplished.

86
00:07:29,661 --> 00:07:33,382
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I, you just think about like statistically, it wouldn't necessarily have

87
00:07:33,837 --> 00:07:35,598
[SPEAKER_01]: your kids make it that far.

88
00:07:35,638 --> 00:07:37,320
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they did, it was really exciting.

89
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:38,560
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very exciting.

90
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:40,282
[SPEAKER_01]: I was very happy for them.

91
00:07:40,462 --> 00:07:41,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

92
00:07:41,082 --> 00:07:42,323
[SPEAKER_03]: A national competition.

93
00:07:42,343 --> 00:07:42,543
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

94
00:07:42,563 --> 00:07:43,044
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember.

95
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:44,385
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the winner was like Texas.

96
00:07:44,405 --> 00:07:44,985
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

97
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:45,986
[SPEAKER_01]: So they did one.

98
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:47,287
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like the worlds we create.

99
00:07:47,327 --> 00:07:51,350
[SPEAKER_01]: And they did this huge deep dive into how social media affects

100
00:07:55,277 --> 00:08:01,322
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say that they were trying to figure out how it affects teens and their mental health and their perception of reality.

101
00:08:01,342 --> 00:08:11,992
[SPEAKER_01]: But they also went as far to do some experiments with how different political parties will target certain people on social media or how ads will target certain people.

102
00:08:12,052 --> 00:08:13,173
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was very interesting.

103
00:08:16,196 --> 00:08:22,303
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm constantly impressed with what middle schoolers are thinking of and focused on.

104
00:08:22,723 --> 00:08:33,976
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the groups they talked about the modeling industry and the pressures it puts on young children, not just girls, but boys or anyone really, the pressure to look a certain way.

105
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:51,180
[SPEAKER_01]: one person was talking about, like, even though she has a disability, how she's still very much engaged in dance and dance makes her feel beautiful, even though she's not considered beautiful by like those, again, model industry standards that another podcast had talked about.

106
00:08:51,240 --> 00:09:00,422
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's amazing to me what the youth in our classrooms today are focused on and what they are consumed by and

107
00:09:01,278 --> 00:09:07,775
[SPEAKER_01]: I am constantly in awe of what they have to say about the world we live in.

108
00:09:08,508 --> 00:09:08,788
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

109
00:09:09,128 --> 00:09:19,291
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I thought that their project, the dress code was really interesting in terms of like gender, also race and all the things that, all the components that they brought into their argument.

110
00:09:19,331 --> 00:09:21,031
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was like very impressive.

111
00:09:21,071 --> 00:09:21,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

112
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:22,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Better than any podcast.

113
00:09:22,971 --> 00:09:23,952
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.

114
00:09:24,032 --> 00:09:25,792
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't say that.

115
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,492
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's a fun project.

116
00:09:27,532 --> 00:09:29,473
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done it now in this class.

117
00:09:30,193 --> 00:09:34,574
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the fifth year doing it and each class kind of requires different things.

118
00:09:34,654 --> 00:09:38,115
[SPEAKER_01]: So like some classes, they require a little bit more hand-holding and they require

119
00:09:38,975 --> 00:09:44,277
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of structure and it's usually me up at the computer listening to what they're saying, typing it all out.

120
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:51,800
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in other classes, students take the lead and they're the ones running the class and creating the project.

121
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:55,822
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really at the heart of it, their project.

122
00:09:56,742 --> 00:10:01,964
[SPEAKER_01]: It's their idea, it's their work, it's their words, it's their voice.

123
00:10:02,484 --> 00:10:09,869
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the class comes up with like several different options, then they present them and they vote on which one they'll make into a podcast?

124
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:10,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

125
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,312
[SPEAKER_01]: So usually we do a little brainstorm session.

126
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:21,217
[SPEAKER_01]: We come up with anywhere from four to six ideas as a class, and then they go into little committees and then they try to persuade the rest of the class that they're

127
00:10:22,278 --> 00:10:24,039
[SPEAKER_01]: proposed idea is the one that we should do.

128
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:25,219
[SPEAKER_01]: They get to vote.

129
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,962
[SPEAKER_01]: And then whichever one wins is the one that we move forward with for the project.

130
00:10:31,322 --> 00:10:38,966
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we start doing research, drafting, outlining, editing, recording, in whatever capacity that is.

131
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:40,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's them going out and doing interviews.

132
00:10:40,626 --> 00:10:42,507
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's them just reporting here in the classroom.

133
00:10:42,547 --> 00:10:46,249
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we synthesize the whole thing together and we submit.

134
00:10:47,051 --> 00:10:51,345
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many different skills and different things that you're putting into that project.

135
00:10:52,590 --> 00:11:03,679
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mentioned this to say, like, I think, you know, we're hearing a lot about teachers these days, especially in Medford, and it's just really nice to hear, like, all the creativity and, like, sort of the extra mile that you're going.

136
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,201
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure the students appreciate it.

137
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:12,447
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder, though, like, in that greater context, like, how, what the emotional experience is for you right now with everything going on with the teacher contract.

138
00:11:12,707 --> 00:11:14,408
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's emotional.

139
00:11:14,428 --> 00:11:15,790
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great way to describe it.

140
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:16,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Emotional.

141
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,612
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very tiring.

142
00:11:18,752 --> 00:11:20,774
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be frustrating at times, but

143
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:36,756
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming into a classroom and seeing kids get excited about something like this, it kind of, it like recharges my battery a little bit because something I love about this project in particular is that every single kid is very excited about it.

144
00:11:37,076 --> 00:11:39,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the kids who don't like writing, they're really excited about it.

145
00:11:40,498 --> 00:11:51,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the kids who don't like speaking out loud, they're really excited about it because they get to participate and they get to do something and create something that is entirely their own and it's something unlike anything they've been able to create before.

146
00:11:53,425 --> 00:12:10,917
[SPEAKER_01]: When I think about everything that's happening outside of school that still has to do with schools and that kind of gets me down or gets me disappointed or discouraged, I then think about what I'm able to do with the kids in here and it makes my heart very happy.

147
00:12:10,957 --> 00:12:12,178
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes my heart smile a lot.

148
00:12:12,758 --> 00:12:12,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

149
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:15,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else that you want folks to know about your class or your work?

150
00:12:19,945 --> 00:12:25,431
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I'm so impressed and inspired by the children in my classroom.

151
00:12:25,631 --> 00:12:40,246
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's really hard being a middle schooler and I say this to my middle schoolers all the time that when they tell me that this is the biggest thing that's ever happened to them, not necessarily like what's going on in my classroom, but if they come to me and there's a problem or they come to me and there's

152
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:45,730
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some drama, and they sing, this is the worst day of my life, or this is the biggest thing that's ever happened to me.

153
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:49,433
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to take that with a grain of salt, because they're only 13, 14 years old.

154
00:12:49,613 --> 00:12:57,480
[SPEAKER_01]: Their library of events in their life, it's much smaller than mine is, and it really might be the biggest thing that's happened to them.

155
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:07,608
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that they have been able to navigate middle school through so many different learning models and make the transition from elementary school to middle school

156
00:13:08,957 --> 00:13:22,244
[SPEAKER_01]: during a pandemic and given everything going on in the world, I just, I'm constantly amazed and inspired by their strength, their resilience, their ferocity with everything they do.

157
00:13:22,484 --> 00:13:26,986
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I'm a better teacher because of them.

158
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:30,168
[SPEAKER_01]: They make me the teacher that I am.

159
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,149
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that they would love to hear that.

160
00:13:32,809 --> 00:13:34,150
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope they know that.

161
00:13:34,210 --> 00:13:38,032
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's just as much I have to learn from them that I hope that they will learn from me.

162
00:13:38,588 --> 00:13:41,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else that you're looking forward to for the coming school year?

163
00:13:41,911 --> 00:13:43,132
[SPEAKER_01]: The coming school year?

164
00:13:45,794 --> 00:13:50,037
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm very excited for them to submit their podcasts to competition.

165
00:13:50,257 --> 00:13:56,062
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited for... I don't even know.

166
00:13:56,182 --> 00:13:57,263
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited for...

167
00:14:00,061 --> 00:14:09,537
[SPEAKER_01]: I have so many different ideas and we were thinking about trying to do more with our Romeo and Juliet unit, trying to do more acting with other princesses in the building.

168
00:14:10,078 --> 00:14:12,042
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that we do a lot of fun.

169
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:19,245
[SPEAKER_01]: projects with the giver and learning about dystopian novels and dystopian societies.

170
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:20,446
[SPEAKER_03]: A little real these days.

171
00:14:21,106 --> 00:14:22,327
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very real these days.

172
00:14:22,407 --> 00:14:30,552
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of kids, they would look at, they would look at examples of propaganda in the book and they'd say, propaganda, I know what that's like.

173
00:14:30,632 --> 00:14:35,095
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess like they would cite certain things that are, that were being said in the news.

174
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,811
[SPEAKER_01]: I really, I enjoy teaching that unit.

175
00:14:38,991 --> 00:14:45,354
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I'm still, I'm still finding my footing in eighth grade, so still trying to figure out what projects work and don't work.

176
00:14:45,394 --> 00:14:49,935
[SPEAKER_01]: We just did this huge debate with the McGlynn, actually, for The Outsiders.

177
00:14:50,035 --> 00:14:58,639
[SPEAKER_01]: So the kids read The Outsiders in eighth grade, and they dressed up as greasers and soches, and they had a rumble, a metaphorical rumble.

178
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:00,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we would have heard about that.

179
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:05,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, in the auditorium, and they debated who was at fault for the events of the novel, and it was really,

180
00:15:06,022 --> 00:15:11,608
[SPEAKER_01]: cool to see eighth graders from different schools coming together, especially because they're going to go be together at the high school.

181
00:15:12,408 --> 00:15:14,330
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got to dress up, which was really fun.

182
00:15:14,671 --> 00:15:16,512
[SPEAKER_01]: And they worked really hard on the preparation.

183
00:15:16,532 --> 00:15:17,934
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was really fun.

184
00:15:17,974 --> 00:15:20,777
[SPEAKER_01]: So trying to figure out more cross school events would be really

185
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Exciting, I think.

186
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:24,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

187
00:15:24,492 --> 00:15:34,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine as things sort of like go back to more of a normal school situation after COVID or from COVID that there's, there are like options that are returning that like this.

188
00:15:34,114 --> 00:15:34,535
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

189
00:15:34,935 --> 00:15:35,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

190
00:15:35,235 --> 00:15:38,235
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, I mean, they got to go to a dance last week, which was fun.

191
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:44,016
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have, these eighth graders, they'd never been to a middle school dance before, which was really fun for them.

192
00:15:44,056 --> 00:15:44,997
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really cool.

193
00:15:45,057 --> 00:15:49,278
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got to last year, we got to take the kids to Canopy Lake Park, which was really fun.

194
00:15:49,298 --> 00:15:50,998
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like, we are getting to do things.

195
00:15:51,678 --> 00:15:54,140
[SPEAKER_01]: that are slightly more, quote, normal.

196
00:15:54,481 --> 00:16:02,168
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no, and I was talking to one of the students and earlier they were saying like that COVID was like kind of happening as they were transitioning to sixth grade.

197
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:07,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I just can't imagine that, like, you know, what they missed in sort of that like social process.

198
00:16:07,814 --> 00:16:10,997
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking with a teacher this morning as we were standing outside.

199
00:16:11,257 --> 00:16:24,601
[SPEAKER_01]: before we came in, and they were saying that this group of eighth graders, they only saw them 50% of the time in sixth grade because they were in the building half of the time if they were one of the students that chose to come into the building.

200
00:16:25,441 --> 00:16:28,482
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes they were here, sometimes they weren't.

201
00:16:29,002 --> 00:16:37,627
[SPEAKER_01]: And these eighth graders, this is really their first kind of typical, and you couldn't even say that that's totally typical year of middle school.

202
00:16:38,267 --> 00:16:45,051
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they're off to the high school, and it's definitely been interesting.

203
00:16:49,674 --> 00:16:50,034
[SPEAKER_01]: Even as

204
00:16:51,565 --> 00:16:59,852
[SPEAKER_01]: a teacher have found it to be interesting because I've literally had a different year every single year since I've been teaching at Medford.

205
00:16:59,872 --> 00:17:12,804
[SPEAKER_01]: My first year was my standard typical year, and then my second year we went to basically quarantine in March, and then we had hybrid, HyFlex my third year, and then last year was

206
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:20,977
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I, last year was kind of similar to this year, but they're so very different in so many different ways.

207
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:21,338
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

208
00:17:21,658 --> 00:17:32,122
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like you were saying before, like you're approaching that as like an adult with what you said, like your library of experiences where these students, like these are, these are things that they haven't, like they have never had to navigate sixth grade.

209
00:17:32,182 --> 00:17:34,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Never had to navigate it in this specific way.

210
00:17:34,483 --> 00:17:34,643
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

211
00:17:34,683 --> 00:17:39,005
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think about, I mean, we were even just discussing what our middle school experiences were like.

212
00:17:39,045 --> 00:17:43,187
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm thinking to myself, wow, as a middle schooler, I had this

213
00:17:45,166 --> 00:18:04,039
[SPEAKER_01]: what used to be considered normal experience, like I went to school, I had my friends, we had social drama and we had academic drama, but we didn't have anything like huge disruption of like academic learning processes in the same way that these students.

214
00:18:05,299 --> 00:18:09,882
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure there's a far more eloquent way to describe what I just did than what I actually said.

215
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:19,153
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a completely redefined experience because of what has happened in the world.

216
00:18:19,413 --> 00:18:33,797
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that we all have to take that in consideration as we move forward because the kids that I'm going to have next year, they've had a slightly more like normalized experience of middle school because last year was their first year and we were back in the building full time.

217
00:18:34,397 --> 00:18:34,777
[SPEAKER_01]: And then.

218
00:18:35,717 --> 00:18:44,803
[SPEAKER_01]: This year, again, back in building full time, it might start to feel a little bit more normal, but then I'm sure we're going to get a group of kids in a few years who

219
00:18:46,807 --> 00:18:58,650
[SPEAKER_01]: had a very different kindergarten experience or first grade experience, and that's going to have completely formed how they interact with academics and with school.

220
00:18:58,850 --> 00:18:59,410
[SPEAKER_03]: With each other.

221
00:18:59,650 --> 00:18:59,930
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

222
00:18:59,970 --> 00:19:05,292
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's a constant learning process, but that's one of the things that we as educators do.

223
00:19:05,992 --> 00:19:11,053
[SPEAKER_01]: We adapt, we assess the situation, and we move forward.

224
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:13,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was going to say it's a big job that you have there, right?

225
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:17,197
[SPEAKER_03]: And part of that also being preparing students for the next step, right?

226
00:19:17,237 --> 00:19:19,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Like taking in all of this, all of it that they're dealing with.

227
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:33,135
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like ELA is not just like, you know, reading and writing, but also these other things like forming arguments, like being able to like kind of think critically and then also like your social emotional well-being, right?

228
00:19:33,675 --> 00:19:38,477
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it is where we're not just trying to teach them 8th grade, we're trying to get them ready for 9th grade.

229
00:19:38,857 --> 00:19:49,302
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to get them ready for their next step because high school is a really big time for them because they get to have more freedom in terms of

230
00:19:51,095 --> 00:20:00,099
[SPEAKER_01]: not only their day, but just like they have to take more ownership over their learning than they do in middle school because they're expected to take on more responsibilities.

231
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:08,703
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a shift away from the parents and the guardians and the grownups at home to being more about what they are doing and what is important to them.

232
00:20:09,103 --> 00:20:14,306
[SPEAKER_01]: And they also then have twice the number of classmates than they did before.

233
00:20:14,326 --> 00:20:18,548
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're in a very large series of buildings and they

234
00:20:19,721 --> 00:20:30,571
[SPEAKER_01]: are making decisions about what they want to do with the rest of their lives because they might be considering a vocational trade, they might be considering going to college, and it's very hard to navigate that.

235
00:20:30,631 --> 00:20:36,777
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to make sure that they are as successful as they can be and just give them the steps and the support that we can.

236
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:37,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you.

237
00:20:38,158 --> 00:20:39,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for all that you're doing.

238
00:20:39,259 --> 00:20:41,521
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me, and thank you for coming to our class today.

239
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:50,589
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anyone knows this, but Danielle's been doing a presentation for the kids about making podcasts and what it is to do a podcast, and they have been having so much fun.

240
00:20:51,029 --> 00:20:54,852
[SPEAKER_01]: They are thrilled to have her here, so it's been very special for us too.

241
00:20:55,353 --> 00:20:56,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Special for me too.

242
00:20:56,454 --> 00:20:57,134
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for having me.

243
00:20:57,154 --> 00:20:57,555
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

244
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks so much for listening to today's episode.
