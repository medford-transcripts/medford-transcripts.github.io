1
00:00:00,031 --> 00:00:04,973
It's about 10 guys that have an opportunity, not just to stand on the podium, but to stand on top of the podium.

2
00:00:05,253 --> 00:00:08,154
And today shook out exactly how we thought it was going to shake out.

3
00:00:08,494 --> 00:00:11,095
Yeah, we know that this race is going to be extremely tight.

4
00:00:11,135 --> 00:00:17,877
And with 400 points available, it is going to be something where all of these athletes have to focus on seizing the moment over all else.

5
00:00:18,137 --> 00:00:26,842
And the person who sees the moment the best yesterday was Jason Hopper, who will be donning the white leader jersey for the first time in his career.

6
00:00:27,323 --> 00:00:28,123
Yeah, you love to see it.

7
00:00:28,183 --> 00:00:34,087
Jason Hopper stormed onto the CrossFit scene a few years ago and has been an athlete close to those podium dreams.

8
00:00:34,427 --> 00:00:37,028
And this weekend, he's going to have an opportunity to make it a reality.

9
00:00:37,288 --> 00:00:41,969
We'll see how Jason now dons that pressure of the white and red leader jersey.

10
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:49,731
The pressure is about as tight as it can be, as the leaderboard is more compressed than we've ever seen after day number one.

11
00:00:49,911 --> 00:00:52,251
Two sets of ties on the leaderboard.

12
00:00:52,591 --> 00:00:57,572
But Jason Hopper is not alone, because Jay Crouch is tied in points with him at 260.

13
00:00:57,632 --> 00:00:59,173
That's right.

14
00:00:59,213 --> 00:01:01,833
Jay Crouch, we talked about having that it factor yesterday.

15
00:01:01,873 --> 00:01:03,994
And it's it in the CrossFit competition.

16
00:01:04,274 --> 00:01:07,296
looks like a very well-rounded output, and he's got that in droves.

17
00:01:07,536 --> 00:01:11,820
He might not be an outlier and win any event outright, but you're going to see him towards the top a lot.

18
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,901
And that's how you chase the podium of Fitness on Earth.

19
00:01:14,101 --> 00:01:16,863
And Roman Krennikov, who had a great event, won.

20
00:01:17,003 --> 00:01:21,046
And just a solid day overall, sitting in third place, four points out.

21
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:21,587
That's right.

22
00:01:21,647 --> 00:01:25,630
Roman's a consistent threat, and he is a home run hitter, Chase.

23
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,192
So there's going to be some stuff on the menu, and it could pop up today within these 400 points.

24
00:01:29,873 --> 00:01:31,294
that are going to be right up Roman's alley.

25
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:34,336
Here's what's on the menu today for you viewers at home.

26
00:01:34,456 --> 00:01:38,358
Event one will start with the men for day number two.

27
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:42,001
Four scored events, 400 points up for grabs.

28
00:01:42,321 --> 00:01:47,324
And I couldn't think of a better way to put it, but today is truly moving day for these athletes.

29
00:01:49,686 --> 00:01:53,148
Individual action from MVP Arena coming up next.

30
00:02:04,287 --> 00:02:08,209
I don't know if I can describe 6PM in one word, but if I had two words, it'd be controlled chaos.

31
00:02:37,227 --> 00:02:39,869
Each of our classes has its own unique characteristic.

32
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:40,930
The 6 p.m.

33
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:59,245
class is a little unique in that it used to be a class that we had a hard time filling and over the last year or two it's become our only capped class because we will now have upwards of 23 to 26, 27 members in that class so it kind of become its own little family.

34
00:03:00,788 --> 00:03:07,660
Some of the groups in 6PM, they're either highly competitive or they're kind of just starting out.

35
00:03:09,243 --> 00:03:10,225
It is controlled chaos.

36
00:03:10,545 --> 00:03:11,086
It is chaos.

37
00:03:12,348 --> 00:03:21,293
Everybody just kind of understands how busy that class is, and everybody loves it so much and wants to be a part of it, that they help me kind of control all of it.

38
00:03:21,613 --> 00:03:23,294
Nobody's ever interfering with each other.

39
00:03:23,394 --> 00:03:24,374
Everybody works really well.

40
00:03:24,394 --> 00:03:26,035
Everybody shares a barbell if they need to.

41
00:03:26,496 --> 00:03:30,958
If we have to run two full heats on a workout with like a 10-minute delay, it's not a big deal.

42
00:03:31,598 --> 00:03:34,340
They're so good about just listening.

43
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,222
They actually listen, unlike some other classes.

44
00:03:42,697 --> 00:03:51,144
We do kind of a social beer club once a month, where a group of us will go out and visit a local small business, try them, just get outside these four walls.

45
00:03:51,184 --> 00:03:52,565
Maybe someone from the 5 a.m.

46
00:03:52,585 --> 00:03:54,266
class may meet someone from the 7 p.m.

47
00:03:54,286 --> 00:03:55,567
class, where they usually wouldn't.

48
00:03:55,787 --> 00:03:59,470
That gives them an opportunity to find camaraderie and family and home.

49
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:03,954
Keep it a nice, tight core.

50
00:04:04,034 --> 00:04:06,136
We're gonna go five, straight arm pullovers.

51
00:04:07,356 --> 00:04:14,556
6PM Cross is unique in that I think it's kind of a really cool cross section of not just our gym, but I think of kind of society.

52
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:19,112
You have a couple of our coaches that may attend that class.

53
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:24,013
And then you have some people that didn't really know CrossFit from anything before they joined here.

54
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:26,494
And now they're definitely getting outside their comfort zone.

55
00:04:26,574 --> 00:04:30,856
We have young kids who are just trying to move and stay healthy.

56
00:04:31,316 --> 00:04:37,258
You have kind of the three fire breathers in there as well that like to go head to head and enjoy that push that they give each other.

57
00:04:39,262 --> 00:04:42,023
A little friendly rivalry, a little competition every day.

58
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:45,145
Me, Brandon, Dustin.

59
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:49,967
We had this thing where we'd always send like a Matt Frazier, you know, meme over to whoever won the workout that day.

60
00:04:50,307 --> 00:04:53,249
Progressed into, what if we did a leader's jersey?

61
00:04:53,509 --> 00:04:59,172
Whoever won the workout that day would wear the shirt the next day and everybody else would have to look at him wearing the dang leader jersey and then, you know, do the Matt Frazier pose.

62
00:04:59,612 --> 00:05:01,473
So we always kind of know who the top dog in the gym is.

63
00:05:02,033 --> 00:05:04,194
Usually me, almost never Brandon.

64
00:05:04,214 --> 00:05:07,395
I mean, I'm just the old guy trying to just hold on to whatever I got.

65
00:05:07,815 --> 00:05:11,637
I was lucky enough to win yesterday, so I am wearing the new jersey today.

66
00:05:12,057 --> 00:05:13,097
And still!

67
00:05:13,678 --> 00:05:15,058
This is my social interaction.

68
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:17,359
And I'm just, you know, proud to have these guys as buddies.

69
00:05:17,419 --> 00:05:18,540
And they want to compete with me.

70
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,020
They want to compete next to me and against me.

71
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,981
So, yeah, I'm really appreciative of these guys.

72
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:23,582
He's got to do his laundry again tonight.

73
00:05:24,462 --> 00:05:31,148
A lot of the uniqueness of our gym and our classes is the way each class becomes its own family.

74
00:05:31,408 --> 00:05:33,129
They don't miss a class.

75
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:36,572
They show up for each other and they support each other through everything.

76
00:05:36,632 --> 00:05:40,435
Cancer survivors and all those things in that class.

77
00:05:40,535 --> 00:05:46,860
It's a microcosm of not only incendia, but I think it's a microcosm of society, which is really cool.

78
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:07,140
Welcome back inside MVP Arena as day two of the 2025 CrossFit Games continues.

79
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:10,506
And it is effectively moving day here in Albany, New York.

80
00:07:10,586 --> 00:07:13,531
I'm Chasing with Adrian Condi and Mr. Saxon Pancheck.

81
00:07:14,197 --> 00:07:14,978
Welcome back, buddy.

82
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:16,218
Welcome back.

83
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:17,879
We are here for event number four.

84
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,981
You've got to test this event.

85
00:07:20,101 --> 00:07:22,022
But this is the CrossFit Games.

86
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,384
Dave Castro just announces a little twist to what we announced.

87
00:07:25,424 --> 00:07:26,665
And the 300s are going to 400.

88
00:07:26,945 --> 00:07:30,047
And we're adding an extra 50 feet at the end on that last handstand walk.

89
00:07:30,268 --> 00:07:35,251
Yeah, I think this is, originally with the 300, I thought it was going to be a little bit more about the transitions.

90
00:07:35,651 --> 00:07:38,353
I think it's going to be who can clear the fatigue the fastest on that run.

91
00:07:39,074 --> 00:07:42,476
And with this particular event, it is the Albany Grip Trip, Adrian.

92
00:07:42,656 --> 00:07:45,037
And this is about as classy as you can get.

93
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:47,078
We've got some monostructural work.

94
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:49,098
We've got the deadlift and the handstand walk.

95
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:51,960
What's the wrinkle here in this particular event?

96
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:54,261
I mean, the wrinkle, of course, is the additional running.

97
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:55,961
But it's going to be a 400-meter run.

98
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:57,762
They're going to go through 12 deadlifts.

99
00:07:58,042 --> 00:07:59,343
And then, of course, we are now

100
00:08:00,183 --> 00:08:04,867
Handstand walking 100 feet, where they're going to go 50 feet out and 50 feet back.

101
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,809
What's your tempo recipe for success here?

102
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:11,911
You've got to be pretty disciplined on keeping your cadence.

103
00:08:11,931 --> 00:08:12,912
And that's going to be with the runner.

104
00:08:12,952 --> 00:08:15,954
It's going to be a little bit of a blind run, knowing where your competitors are.

105
00:08:16,294 --> 00:08:19,737
And then you've got to race the rest, which means it's OK to break those deadlifts.

106
00:08:19,777 --> 00:08:22,539
But you need to be urgent in getting to that next set.

107
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,360
And it's a similar approach with the handstand walk.

108
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,681
Lane assignments for heat number one.

109
00:08:26,721 --> 00:08:29,603
We have two heats to start the morning off.

110
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:32,405
We flip the field, we've got two sets of 15.

111
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,427
Rescoring after every single event.

112
00:08:37,649 --> 00:08:38,810
Have a lot of athletes.

113
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:42,504
trying to get their way out of the bottom 15.

114
00:08:42,764 --> 00:08:44,626
They had a tough day one, and good for them.

115
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,149
They got 400 points up for grabbing.

116
00:08:47,509 --> 00:08:48,530
Saxon, you tested this.

117
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:51,973
Where are the athletes, and when are they going to feel it the most in this event?

118
00:08:52,174 --> 00:08:58,840
I think getting into that second run and that third run, I think that's going to be the most important, especially with those runs being a little bit longer.

119
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:03,025
I think looking at their posture running, it will be a really good indicator.

120
00:09:04,489 --> 00:09:09,755
Day two underway, starting with the 400-meter run.

121
00:09:11,658 --> 00:09:18,446
On these runners, and Adrian, we've talked about this, we went long yesterday on the run, six miles, but that was outside.

122
00:09:19,881 --> 00:09:21,882
on some asphalt and roads.

123
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:24,484
What's the difference between that and the runner?

124
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,024
Well, it's a few things.

125
00:09:26,104 --> 00:09:29,086
And Saxon and I were actually chatting about this right when he got up here.

126
00:09:29,106 --> 00:09:35,409
I was like, sir, these woodways are a little different than what you can find between most floor wall affiliates.

127
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,732
And what this tends to do is add some taxing to the back half of your body.

128
00:09:39,752 --> 00:09:47,516
The hamstrings, the glutes, the low back are going to be fatigued a bit differently than what these athletes feel when they're running on regular asphalt.

129
00:09:48,076 --> 00:09:50,738
The meters will be designated in front of their lanes.

130
00:09:50,758 --> 00:09:51,859
Again, 400 total.

131
00:09:51,979 --> 00:09:59,946
And speaking like Air Runner to Air Runner, there's a difference, too, because we haven't seen a Woodway version in live competition, maybe ever, especially at the CrossFit Games.

132
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:00,767
What's the difference?

133
00:10:00,947 --> 00:10:03,369
Yeah, I think there's a little more tension in it.

134
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:06,172
So I think it's going to blow that posterior up just a tad more.

135
00:10:06,352 --> 00:10:08,974
And I think you'll spend a little bit more time on there than you're expecting.

136
00:10:08,994 --> 00:10:13,458
You know, we're looking at these athletes just passing that 200 meter mark and we're about a minute 10 in.

137
00:10:14,479 --> 00:10:16,940
You know, that's putting us a little over two minutes for a 400.

138
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:22,244
So I would say outside, these guys are running anywhere from a minute 30 to a minute 45.

139
00:10:22,304 --> 00:10:24,305
So there's going to be a little more time on there for sure.

140
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:36,934
Again, this is five rounds, 40-meter runs on the runner, 12 deadlifts at 350 pounds with the axle bar, and then 100-foot handstand walk down and back 50 feet across the field.

141
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:40,097
Now, in a five-round event, Adrian, is that

142
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:44,699
is that you use that first round to say, hey, listen, I know how I felt in testing.

143
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:48,501
I know how I felt in the warm-up area, but let's see how I feel out in the competition floor.

144
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:51,322
Use that first round to get a feel for how your body's responding.

145
00:10:52,073 --> 00:11:01,099
Yeah, I mean, to a degree, Chase, what you want to do is make sure that you get off that runner in full control, but immediately ready to deadlift.

146
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:08,844
Where you'll start to see athletes run into trouble is if they get off that runner and there's a lot of pausing and waiting before they approach the bar, you know they overshot their run pace.

147
00:11:09,425 --> 00:11:13,888
First athlete off the runner was actually Tiago Lucis at a split time of 2.35.

148
00:11:17,677 --> 00:11:23,621
You tested this event, and the early twist was that the deadlifts would be done with an axle bar.

149
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:33,287
350 pounds for elite games athletes like this necessarily isn't the heaviest weight, but for 12 reps times 5, 60 total, what's the trick of that axle bar?

150
00:11:33,347 --> 00:11:35,529
Yeah, I think it's fast, manageable sets.

151
00:11:35,549 --> 00:11:37,150
You got to stay over top of the barbell.

152
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:38,031
Don't move your feet.

153
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:41,053
Make sure you're dropping it over your shoes and pick it up right away.

154
00:11:41,693 --> 00:11:43,034
You're seeing Nick Matthew here.

155
00:11:43,575 --> 00:11:45,156
He moved pretty quickly on that deadlift.

156
00:11:45,196 --> 00:11:45,897
He was aggressive.

157
00:11:45,917 --> 00:11:49,840
He's kind of looking around and seeing where other athletes are and how they're breaking.

158
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,083
Right now, I would say he's kind of controlling this race, and we'll see what he does on this next run.

159
00:11:55,632 --> 00:12:01,535
The deadliest split, the fastest one, is Colton Mertens, who finished it in 19 seconds.

160
00:12:01,635 --> 00:12:05,236
Nick Matthew, as you mentioned, was six seconds behind him.

161
00:12:05,957 --> 00:12:08,098
But it'll be Matthew to the runner first.

162
00:12:10,299 --> 00:12:13,540
Handstand walk split for Nick Matthew is 37 seconds.

163
00:12:15,461 --> 00:12:17,542
Most of the time will be spent on the runner.

164
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:23,245
If that's the case, is there more of an emphasis to push the pace on the one that's going to take the longest?

165
00:12:24,338 --> 00:12:31,020
I think, yes, but I think also, you know, if you push that too hard, it's going to blow that posterior up a little bit more.

166
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:39,823
I think, you know, who can clear fatigue the fastest within that first 100 meters, you know, if you can do it in the first 20 to 50, I think that would be ideal and be able to pick that speed up.

167
00:12:40,644 --> 00:12:47,026
I think seeing who gets off this next run will be a really good indicator on who's going to be able to move through these next two rounds.

168
00:12:48,018 --> 00:12:50,599
fastest split we had on the first 400 meters.

169
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:57,721
We said it was Tiago Lucis as Colton Mertens had the fastest deadlift split, seven seconds faster than anyone.

170
00:12:57,761 --> 00:13:03,063
And Colton Mertens is one of those athletes that had a great off-season, great in-season qualifying.

171
00:13:03,523 --> 00:13:07,385
Best place finish was 18th at the CrossFit Games.

172
00:13:07,445 --> 00:13:14,307
And finding himself in, I would say, a place on the leaderboard that is not going to suit him for the rest of the day.

173
00:13:15,997 --> 00:13:17,397
It's not optimal for Colton.

174
00:13:17,457 --> 00:13:19,698
He's going to have an opportunity to do some moving.

175
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,519
We know that with what is looming and what has been announced.

176
00:13:23,019 --> 00:13:24,379
We understand he's going to have that there.

177
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:30,861
Nick Matthewchase, what I like about what we saw there, he was very composed on that first run, which he's clearly showing that again.

178
00:13:31,281 --> 00:13:38,023
But him making fast work of those deadlifts put him in that situation that Saxton alluded to where he was the one in control as we made our way back to the treadmill.

179
00:13:38,977 --> 00:13:44,600
One of those things you said looming later today, it'd actually be the next event for the individuals.

180
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,822
And that is a one rep max back squat.

181
00:13:48,302 --> 00:13:58,108
And I can't think of two things worse to set me up for success there than all the 2,000 meters of running on a runner and 60 heavy deadlifts with an axle bar.

182
00:13:58,288 --> 00:13:59,889
Hey, posterior city today.

183
00:14:00,469 --> 00:14:03,091
Yanukovsky in his 10th CrossFit Games.

184
00:14:04,972 --> 00:14:14,996
had just missed last year for 10 consecutive, but he is in rare company of 10 CrossFit Games appearances.

185
00:14:16,097 --> 00:14:18,197
Nick Matthew off the runner first.

186
00:14:18,217 --> 00:14:24,580
Nick Matthew split on the first one much faster.

187
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,561
Sorry, on the second one, much faster, 2.04.

188
00:14:30,315 --> 00:14:32,557
He's breaking those into 9 and 3, quick break.

189
00:14:33,198 --> 00:14:33,718
I like that.

190
00:14:33,738 --> 00:14:41,025
You know, a small set before kicking up on those handstands, I think it gives him a little extra breath to be able to make that transition pretty quick.

191
00:14:41,085 --> 00:14:43,247
And the cadence on that is very fast as well.

192
00:14:43,267 --> 00:14:46,891
He's not spending too much time at the top where he's under tension.

193
00:14:47,391 --> 00:14:50,074
Andrew, you see a lot of these athletes breaking up early.

194
00:14:51,864 --> 00:14:58,425
Is that coming from testing or conscious decision, knowing that this event is more of a grind than people may think it's going to be?

195
00:14:58,865 --> 00:15:02,306
No doubt about it, being very predicted and practiced.

196
00:15:02,966 --> 00:15:05,127
Also, I think it's a bit of a response to that grip fatigue.

197
00:15:05,147 --> 00:15:09,688
You're going to notice a lot of difference in bar speeds as we watch the deadlifts come off the ground.

198
00:15:09,988 --> 00:15:12,128
Some of that is their ability to move a load.

199
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:18,730
And some of that is the grip fatigue, in which if they move too quickly, they're only going to fatigue their hands even more through rep to rep.

200
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,830
And we did a lot of pegboard and hanging yesterday.

201
00:15:20,950 --> 00:15:23,631
Well, it's called Albany grip trip for a reason.

202
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:26,171
And we talk about grip on the axle bar.

203
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:32,593
But one thing that people may not understand, handstand walking is a taxing grip element as well.

204
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:33,393
Absolutely.

205
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:39,995
You know, the time under tension on the handstands, especially, I mean, you're talking 100 feet, you know, over five rounds.

206
00:15:40,215 --> 00:15:40,995
That's going to add up.

207
00:15:42,515 --> 00:15:44,556
McMatthew still in the lead.

208
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:54,769
And Nick Matthews, one of those athletes that is really looking forward to that max back slot.

209
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:58,411
Colton Mertens had a tough day yesterday.

210
00:15:58,511 --> 00:16:01,312
Some of that was execution, but another that was equipment.

211
00:16:02,252 --> 00:16:03,493
And, you know, Saxon.

212
00:16:05,203 --> 00:16:07,325
I mean, you see what happens in a day like that.

213
00:16:07,385 --> 00:16:12,809
How do you treat last night and respond coming into this morning?

214
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:13,810
I think you have the present.

215
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,313
You have to focus on the present and the points you have on the table, and that's it.

216
00:16:17,353 --> 00:16:22,938
I think everybody will have, most people will have a bad event at some point, and that was your event.

217
00:16:23,338 --> 00:16:26,581
So now it's time to move forward and see what you can capitalize on next.

218
00:16:26,961 --> 00:16:30,384
I will say this, if you look at Colton Stride, he has a very fast cadence.

219
00:16:30,864 --> 00:16:33,367
When you're moving on one of these runners, you don't want to be reaching.

220
00:16:33,387 --> 00:16:35,309
That's where you're really going to tax that posterior.

221
00:16:35,349 --> 00:16:42,617
So he has a fast, choppy stride, which is going to allow him to move a little bit more and use those quads rather than those hamstrings.

222
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:52,396
Colton Mertens on the left, Nick Matthew on the right, Bill Leahy sitting in third overall in this heat.

223
00:16:52,516 --> 00:16:55,319
A lot slower cadence than we saw with Colton Mertens.

224
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,781
Yeah, definitely.

225
00:16:57,442 --> 00:16:59,304
And we'll see what happens on these next two runs.

226
00:16:59,324 --> 00:17:02,208
Like I said, I think that third round and that fourth round

227
00:17:02,388 --> 00:17:05,771
on the run is going to be kind of the bread and butter, meat and potatoes on this workout.

228
00:17:05,811 --> 00:17:09,994
So if he can move there and save a little bit in the tank, I think he can make some moves here.

229
00:17:10,374 --> 00:17:13,417
But you cannot wait until the last round to make your move.

230
00:17:13,457 --> 00:17:16,659
That needs to be made on the back end of this and into this next round.

231
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:22,163
Curly in that middle round of five is Nick Matthew on the right side of your screen.

232
00:17:22,223 --> 00:17:26,026
It's about 15 meters left to finish out his third 400 meter.

233
00:17:28,785 --> 00:17:32,628
And you look at his transition, you know, whenever he gets off here, he's right on it.

234
00:17:32,688 --> 00:17:35,730
He's hitting nine quick, and then he'll take that little bit of a longer break.

235
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:42,075
And you're seeing some of these other athletes break those into fours, where they're taking, you know, that rest can start to add up pretty quick.

236
00:17:42,115 --> 00:17:45,458
He's off the runner, right on the barbell, hands on it, and he's moving.

237
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:46,599
And that cadence is fast.

238
00:17:47,157 --> 00:17:50,941
And 350 pounds with that thicker axle bar.

239
00:17:50,961 --> 00:17:53,163
It's about twice as thick as a normal barbell.

240
00:17:53,944 --> 00:17:59,829
The problem with that is, yes, it's grip for one thing, Adrian, but whip that you're not getting is another.

241
00:18:00,698 --> 00:18:08,526
Yeah, the barbell is going to be a little bit shorter in length, and the thicker diameter is also going to add to the resistance to the bar to bend at all.

242
00:18:08,706 --> 00:18:13,812
And that bend and width is something we get really familiar with when we're used to only using traditional barbells.

243
00:18:13,852 --> 00:18:17,876
So this is certainly the odd object experience at the CrossFit Games.

244
00:18:18,797 --> 00:18:23,262
Nick Matthews, still your current leader in this heat, followed by Bill Leahy in second.

245
00:18:24,796 --> 00:18:27,221
You do not have to go 50 feet unbroken.

246
00:18:27,261 --> 00:18:30,848
That yellow line that Nick Matthew just passed is a 25 foot mark.

247
00:18:30,888 --> 00:18:36,559
So athletes do have the option to take a break in the middle, though we haven't seen any athlete do that so far.

248
00:18:38,937 --> 00:18:40,397
This is interesting what we're seeing.

249
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:45,339
Even as Saxton and I talk about it before we get going, we're like, OK, maybe this puts a little bit more onus on the run.

250
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:49,620
And within this heat, at least, we're noticing that might not be the case.

251
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,061
These guys came out that were more reserved and had more urgency in the transitions.

252
00:18:53,361 --> 00:18:55,102
And in their breaks are the ones that are leading the way.

253
00:18:55,382 --> 00:18:55,942
Absolutely.

254
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,283
I think we'll see Leahy make a move here.

255
00:18:58,823 --> 00:19:02,504
His transitions seem to be pretty quick on these handstands.

256
00:19:04,384 --> 00:19:05,325
And, you know, I think.

257
00:19:06,525 --> 00:19:08,066
Once this run's done, we'll see.

258
00:19:08,086 --> 00:19:10,847
You know, I think those top three will stay those top three.

259
00:19:11,448 --> 00:19:13,869
Colton Mertens will take a break at the halfway point.

260
00:19:13,989 --> 00:19:24,914
If Mertens does have a big chink in his armor, it is high-volume handstand walks, as Bill Leahy on the right does 50 feet down and back, and back on the runner.

261
00:19:24,934 --> 00:19:29,577
So Mertens was off the deadlift first, but Leahy caught him on the handstand walk.

262
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:47,504
McMatthew to 18th place finishes to start the day yesterday and that 22nd place finish in that pegboard event as Jack Rosema gets to the woodway runner just to his left.

263
00:19:49,691 --> 00:19:58,559
And the unfortunate thing for Nick here is that we've got coaches and athletes in the back right now witnessing what he's doing, understanding exactly how long he's taking on that woodway.

264
00:19:58,579 --> 00:19:59,420
And they're like, OK, cool.

265
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,781
Can we do this on transitions?

266
00:20:00,821 --> 00:20:02,903
And then that means you've just got to be off the woodway in this time.

267
00:20:03,203 --> 00:20:09,389
So he's got 15 guys watching him, his every move, breaking it down so that they have an opportunity to one-up his score.

268
00:20:09,429 --> 00:20:13,433
Nick's got to be focused in order to get a score that's going to be within the top 15 for this one.

269
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,337
McMatthew, your leader in this heat.

270
00:20:17,377 --> 00:20:18,319
Heat one of two.

271
00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:22,647
Jack Rozema, great finish last night on the pegboard event.

272
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:26,475
I tell you what, that pegboard event was just an absolute grenade on the leaderboard last night.

273
00:20:27,612 --> 00:20:28,333
Love to see that.

274
00:20:28,753 --> 00:20:33,497
I think having events like that that shake things up, it will make it interesting over the weekend.

275
00:20:33,557 --> 00:20:36,840
That was a skilled test and execution.

276
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:37,901
I think that's important.

277
00:20:37,921 --> 00:20:41,044
You have to be able to execute on some of these more complex movements.

278
00:20:41,604 --> 00:20:43,386
We'll have a bit of that later tonight.

279
00:20:43,426 --> 00:20:45,748
Dave Kaschu announced events six and seven.

280
00:20:45,788 --> 00:20:47,669
That is going to be a wild night.

281
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,092
That will be more execution based on pacing in racing.

282
00:20:51,112 --> 00:20:52,634
That is the skill itself.

283
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:53,534
As Bill Leahy

284
00:20:54,375 --> 00:21:18,425
a little slower on the run but it seems to be affording him a bit more energy on the walk yeah you know i mean if he's making his move on the handstand walk and we're finishing on that handstand walk 150 unbroken or 100 105 125 150 total yeah 150 total feet in that final round yes sir um hey moves can happen there bill leahy rookie appearance at the cross of games actually got his

285
00:21:19,469 --> 00:21:24,271
I'd say he was more known in our circle of being a tester for games events back in the day.

286
00:21:25,232 --> 00:21:27,773
Had an Achilles injury last year at the West Coast Classic.

287
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:36,558
So the turnaround he had in a year is quite incredible as Nick Matthew is the only athlete off the runner and back onto the fourth set of deadlifts.

288
00:21:37,258 --> 00:21:39,099
Saxton, it's a five-round event.

289
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:43,181
The round of four, I mean, that's just kind of that death trap.

290
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:44,741
You have to move.

291
00:21:44,781 --> 00:21:46,082
You have to stay awake.

292
00:21:46,522 --> 00:21:48,723
You know, you can't get comfortable.

293
00:21:48,803 --> 00:21:52,945
Even if people aren't making moves or anyone looks close, put the throttle down here.

294
00:21:53,658 --> 00:21:55,959
Yeah, this is the one, even in training, right?

295
00:21:55,979 --> 00:22:01,681
This is the one where you have to remind yourself that round before the final round, where everyone is lured into the final round.

296
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:03,762
We're all going to give our best on the final, of course.

297
00:22:04,122 --> 00:22:13,646
But if you can somehow manage one of your most focused efforts here in the second to last round, that's really where you get an opportunity to create that separation.

298
00:22:13,926 --> 00:22:17,247
This transition here with Nick, this is, I would say, his longest transition.

299
00:22:17,267 --> 00:22:22,349
Now, he's keeping these unbroken, but it will be interesting to see what happens on this last handstand walk.

300
00:22:23,824 --> 00:22:25,784
Here comes Leahy, and his transition's quick.

301
00:22:27,725 --> 00:22:29,165
Bill Leahy at the bottom part of the street.

302
00:22:29,205 --> 00:22:36,527
Nick Matthew actually got called back, because you have to start with both hands clearly behind the start red line.

303
00:22:38,107 --> 00:22:51,390
And that little misstep, when you got Bill Leahy breathing down your neck on the handstand walk, as Nick Matthew is done with round four and moving into his fifth and final round.

304
00:22:55,617 --> 00:23:04,518
Bill Lahey starting to close the gap, although maybe running out of room as we just have one round left to go.

305
00:23:07,274 --> 00:23:11,636
14 minutes in, the time cap has now moved up to 22 minutes.

306
00:23:11,676 --> 00:23:15,058
So everyone will have an opportunity to do all 60 deadlifts.

307
00:23:15,098 --> 00:23:16,238
Hey, you're finishing this.

308
00:23:17,959 --> 00:23:20,380
Bill Lahey on the right, Nick Matthew on the left.

309
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,742
Nick Matthew hasn't had the best split in any single particular part of this event.

310
00:23:25,842 --> 00:23:29,284
However, his consistency is keeping him in the front of the pack.

311
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:32,915
And Saxon spoke to this about stride length and frequency.

312
00:23:32,955 --> 00:23:35,358
And Nick Matthews got a pretty short, choppy cadence.

313
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:42,387
But keeping it quick with a faster turnover, when we get a chance to see Bill, we see that he's a little bit longer, a little bit slower.

314
00:23:42,407 --> 00:23:45,111
And then you wonder, is that accumulating for him on his deadlift?

315
00:23:45,151 --> 00:23:48,255
Or is he waiting for a moment to maybe speed it up here going into the final?

316
00:23:48,455 --> 00:23:51,599
Yeah, you've kind of seen that stride lengthen a little bit more.

317
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:57,786
And when you look at athletes' shoulders and chest when they're running, I think that's a good indicator with how they're feeling.

318
00:23:57,846 --> 00:23:59,988
And you can kind of see he's coming down a little bit.

319
00:24:00,088 --> 00:24:02,651
I'll tell you who's looking strong on this run is Colton.

320
00:24:03,933 --> 00:24:04,593
Colton Mertens.

321
00:24:06,053 --> 00:24:08,394
Again, he has to put the work in on the run.

322
00:24:08,434 --> 00:24:11,936
He's been putting the work in on the deficit because we know the difficulty of the handstand walk.

323
00:24:12,436 --> 00:24:21,201
One thing to remember, though, Bill Leahy, in the last 100-foot handstand walk, made up 12 seconds on Nick Matthew.

324
00:24:21,701 --> 00:24:25,743
In the final round of this event, we're adding another 50 feet.

325
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:34,368
So Bill Leahy may have an opportunity to catch and pass Nick Matthew because he's making up all that time on the handstand walk.

326
00:24:34,648 --> 00:24:38,389
Absolutely, and that could be something he's thinking is like, hey, let's take this run a little bit slower.

327
00:24:38,429 --> 00:24:43,531
We got an extra 50 feet here, a little more time, and let's move on these deadlifts and make a move on the handstand walk.

328
00:24:44,071 --> 00:24:51,554
I always think you want to be in the lead, but if you can keep that contact and know that you're feeling good and you can make a move, I think that's a strong position to be in.

329
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:55,035
Approaching the 16-minute mark.

330
00:24:58,918 --> 00:25:02,321
As Nick Matthews on his final 50 meters.

331
00:25:02,461 --> 00:25:05,684
His meters designated in the bottom left of the runner.

332
00:25:06,385 --> 00:25:09,247
Chalking up those hands like a pure vet right there on that wood way.

333
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,029
Not going to waste time in the transition.

334
00:25:11,089 --> 00:25:14,572
He's ready to rock and roll with that chalk hidden behind his monitor.

335
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:16,613
Nick Matthews was off.

336
00:25:16,674 --> 00:25:20,857
He had to break the last deadlift set up into three.

337
00:25:22,999 --> 00:25:23,680
He was off the 16-10 mark.

338
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:33,543
His cycle rate really is impressive with that 350 at this point in that workout.

339
00:25:34,243 --> 00:25:41,605
The way he's able to maximize time under tension by simply just moving the bar quicker from the ground is really lending itself as an advantage for him.

340
00:25:43,105 --> 00:25:50,707
Two final reps for Nick Matthew with a solid run and set as he looks over to his right shoulder to see where Bill Leahy is.

341
00:25:53,245 --> 00:25:57,568
Matthew had a 20-second lead coming into the barbell.

342
00:25:58,349 --> 00:26:02,491
Now we have an extra 50 feet on this final round as Bill Leahy.

343
00:26:02,531 --> 00:26:03,352
Making a move.

344
00:26:03,752 --> 00:26:07,915
He's going to try everything he can to get to that handstand walk.

345
00:26:07,955 --> 00:26:12,758
But Nick Matthew is doing exactly what he needs to do to stay ahead of Leahy.

346
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:17,201
50 feet down for Matthew.

347
00:26:18,902 --> 00:26:22,084
And that deadlift, it's getting tough for Bill Leahy.

348
00:26:24,462 --> 00:26:28,786
And you can tell it's labored by how hard he was slamming it into the ground to get it back going.

349
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:31,548
But no rest whatsoever.

350
00:26:32,109 --> 00:26:36,673
And Nick Matthew breaks at the halfway point for the first time.

351
00:26:41,797 --> 00:26:43,739
Matthew's done with his first 50 feet.

352
00:26:43,759 --> 00:26:46,441
Nick, or second 50 feet.

353
00:26:46,461 --> 00:26:47,903
Late, he done with his first.

354
00:26:49,595 --> 00:26:52,156
Matthew has 50 more feet to the finish line.

355
00:26:52,616 --> 00:26:54,797
This is where we're in a little bit of foreign territory for Nick.

356
00:26:54,837 --> 00:26:59,579
We haven't had to do this extra 50 feet the entire event, and now he's got to finish with 50 more.

357
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:03,860
Getting a little shaky on that walk.

358
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,781
Will he break it 25 feet again?

359
00:27:06,301 --> 00:27:09,462
He will, keeping his eyes on Bill Lahey.

360
00:27:09,482 --> 00:27:11,163
Nick Matthew is 25 feet.

361
00:27:18,589 --> 00:27:22,230
And Matthew will get it.

362
00:27:22,250 --> 00:27:23,951
18-17 for Nick Matthew.

363
00:27:28,232 --> 00:27:31,814
Bill Leahy will break at the 25-foot mark for the first time.

364
00:27:41,677 --> 00:27:42,897
Bill Leahy will be in.

365
00:27:43,658 --> 00:27:44,398
Second in the heat.

366
00:27:46,318 --> 00:27:47,659
This is heat one of two.

367
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:50,041
Ty Jenkins came across.

368
00:27:50,801 --> 00:27:52,723
Really flew through his final round.

369
00:27:58,947 --> 00:28:00,048
Enrico Zanoni.

370
00:28:01,969 --> 00:28:13,697
He got actually had to get called back earlier as Colton Mertens is trying to get across the finish line.

371
00:28:15,018 --> 00:28:15,599
And he'll be in.

372
00:28:16,518 --> 00:28:19,000
Yeah, I don't think Jenkins got his hands across that line.

373
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:20,721
I think he had to go back and redo that 25 feet.

374
00:28:20,761 --> 00:28:25,504
Jorge Fernandez.

375
00:28:26,584 --> 00:28:29,206
We're going to his final 150 feet.

376
00:28:38,672 --> 00:28:39,553
Jack Rosema.

377
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:44,316
At the 25 foot mark, he'll keep going.

378
00:28:48,324 --> 00:28:51,407
And you're seeing this last 50 feet be a big factor.

379
00:28:51,828 --> 00:28:54,931
That is a wide handstand walk.

380
00:28:54,971 --> 00:28:55,712
Yeah, they got wide.

381
00:28:55,732 --> 00:28:56,773
You don't want them to get wide.

382
00:28:56,793 --> 00:28:58,454
When it gets wide, you're in a bit of trouble.

383
00:29:00,336 --> 00:29:10,687
Two minutes before we hit the time cap, Jorge Fernandez taking a break before he makes his last extra 50 foot handstand walk to finish this out.

384
00:29:17,888 --> 00:29:19,150
He has 25 feet left to go.

385
00:29:21,512 --> 00:29:23,274
Yeah, we talk about accumulation of work.

386
00:29:23,334 --> 00:29:27,017
And I mean, we're getting through 60 of these deadlifts at 350 with a fat bar.

387
00:29:27,558 --> 00:29:32,323
Already 350 feet of handstand walking as you lead into that final round.

388
00:29:32,383 --> 00:29:37,208
And so it's certainly, we're seeing its toll add up on these athletes as they enter that final phase.

389
00:29:38,790 --> 00:29:48,760
Absolutely, and looking what this will do later today with the back squat coming up and we got some gymnastics movements on the bar, you know, grip and posterior will be a big factor.

390
00:29:49,681 --> 00:29:54,526
Moritz Fiebing, fishing out his final handstand walk.

391
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:56,308
Got a little over a minute to go.

392
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:00,433
About a minute to that time.

393
00:30:00,453 --> 00:30:06,800
Yeah, Sasson, you've been a part of a lot of different competitions around the world in your career.

394
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:10,103
But what is it like being at the CrossFit Games?

395
00:30:10,303 --> 00:30:11,945
Yeah, it's special.

396
00:30:12,566 --> 00:30:13,907
You have so many events.

397
00:30:13,947 --> 00:30:18,352
And I think that that's one of the biggest things is you have to be present in what you're doing.

398
00:30:18,692 --> 00:30:21,316
You know, if you get caught up, it's easy to play the what if game.

399
00:30:21,336 --> 00:30:22,257
You know, I wish I did this.

400
00:30:22,297 --> 00:30:27,504
I wish I did that on previous events or look forward to other events of like, this is where I want to make my move.

401
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:35,395
You have to bring it for every event, because at the end of the weekend, you will always look back and you're like, I wish I had a point here, three points here.

402
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:37,016
Every point counts.

403
00:30:37,456 --> 00:30:40,299
And, you know, I was talking to Scott a little bit about this yesterday.

404
00:30:40,319 --> 00:30:43,621
You know, you had some people kind of struggling on that pegboard a little bit.

405
00:30:44,082 --> 00:30:48,245
You see the champs who can overcome those moments of slipping out of the pegboard.

406
00:30:48,305 --> 00:30:51,608
Like, how do you handle that adversity and be able to overcome it?

407
00:30:51,628 --> 00:30:54,770
10 seconds before you hit the time cap.

408
00:30:56,492 --> 00:31:00,315
And just two athletes left out on the competition floor.

409
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:02,837
One of those being Yonakoski.

410
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:14,764
But Nick Matthew, wire to wire, takes heat number one for event number four.

411
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:17,846
And these highlights presented by Rogue Fitness.

412
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:23,524
Nick Matthew came out and executed to a high level right out of the beginning.

413
00:31:24,024 --> 00:31:29,490
We talked about it being predominantly a run workout, but Nick really wasn't the first one off that wood way in the early rounds.

414
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:35,097
But it was vet moves just like this proper pacing, using chalk in his transitions to even finish up his run.

415
00:31:35,137 --> 00:31:35,738
So there was no.

416
00:31:36,198 --> 00:31:41,442
wasted moment, and he made light work of that 350 pounds for all 60 repetitions.

417
00:31:41,803 --> 00:31:53,512
We did start to see Bill Leahy make up some ground on the handstand walk late, but it was Nick that was able to understand himself at a very high level, find his way across the finish line, and it ended up not being a very close race.

418
00:31:53,572 --> 00:31:56,535
Mr. Nick Matthew is our event leader so far.

419
00:31:57,255 --> 00:32:06,743
Nick Matthews set the time to beat in heat number one and we only have one heat left to go so 1818.86 for heat number one.

420
00:32:06,843 --> 00:32:08,944
Saxon, thank you for joining us in the booth.

421
00:32:08,984 --> 00:32:12,007
I appreciate it.

422
00:32:12,067 --> 00:32:17,051
Event one, event four, heat one is done.

423
00:32:17,351 --> 00:32:22,135
Your standings after one day of competition

424
00:32:23,247 --> 00:32:29,551
Jason Hopper donning the red and the white for the first time in his career with 260 points.

425
00:32:29,611 --> 00:32:34,375
But Jake Crouch will be right next to him on the floor, tied at 260.

426
00:32:34,815 --> 00:32:38,117
And a four-way tie for points in fourth place.

427
00:32:38,137 --> 00:32:40,379
This is absolutely incredible.

428
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:44,682
Event number four, Albany Grip Trip.

429
00:32:47,908 --> 00:32:52,092
It is grippy, and Chase, it's a little bit trippy, especially on that final round.

430
00:32:52,352 --> 00:32:57,396
Five rounds for time of a 400-meter run, which the athletes just found out about prior to taking the floor.

431
00:32:57,617 --> 00:33:02,541
12 deadlifts at 350 pounds and a 100-foot handstand walk until round five, where it's 150 feet.

432
00:33:05,665 --> 00:33:07,665
For more on this event, let's go down to Mike Arsenault.

433
00:33:08,126 --> 00:33:08,626
Thanks, Chase.

434
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:15,567
I had a chance earlier this morning to spend five minutes on one of these woodways, and immediately, the first few strides, you feel it in your hamstrings.

435
00:33:15,587 --> 00:33:17,168
You guys alluded to that in the first heat.

436
00:33:17,488 --> 00:33:18,688
Very hamstring dominant.

437
00:33:18,768 --> 00:33:27,730
If you tilt your torso forward to try and take some pressure off your hamstrings and save them for the deadlifts, that's when you kind of get the roadrunner going and you get out of control with your stride length.

438
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:34,712
So you have to find that happy medium between saving some hamstrings and making sure you have that smooth cadence throughout the entirety of the 400-meter lap.

439
00:33:36,893 --> 00:33:37,533
Thank you, Mike.

440
00:33:37,573 --> 00:33:41,535
You're laying assignments for heat number two for the men.

441
00:33:41,555 --> 00:33:44,656
These are your top 15 after day number one.

442
00:33:46,377 --> 00:33:48,738
And the points are close.

443
00:33:48,838 --> 00:33:50,359
We've had a four-way tie for 240.

444
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:54,581
For fourth, a two-way tie at the top of the leaderboard.

445
00:33:55,441 --> 00:33:59,163
And can Jason Hopper hold onto the white jersey for another event?

446
00:34:03,545 --> 00:34:04,826
Event number four underway.

447
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:13,298
Okay, Chase, I'm going to already tell you, this heat is not like the last heat that we just watched.

448
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:22,645
We've got some runners on deck here in this top 15, and I think they're really already showing us that they're coming out at a much aggressive, much more aggressive pace on those woodwinds.

449
00:34:23,466 --> 00:34:31,292
Jay Crouch tied for first place in points as Jason Hopper holds on to that tiebreaker.

450
00:34:31,352 --> 00:34:32,633
But what a day for Jay.

451
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:37,002
Yeah, Jay did exactly what we expected him to do.

452
00:34:37,503 --> 00:34:39,404
Well-rounded from start to finish.

453
00:34:39,865 --> 00:34:44,548
Again, we can give him the category, in the most positive way, as a creeper.

454
00:34:44,588 --> 00:34:46,230
He's going to creep through this weekend.

455
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:51,434
He might not win 100 points at any one given event, but he is going to be steadily towards the top.

456
00:34:51,694 --> 00:34:54,857
Roman Korenikov is in that third overall position.

457
00:34:54,937 --> 00:34:59,600
He's between the point spread of ties on the leaderboard as

458
00:35:00,694 --> 00:35:04,896
Roman, as he usually does, gets a lot of fanfare from the crowd.

459
00:35:07,717 --> 00:35:16,700
But heavy is the head that wears the white leader jersey, Jason Hopper, donning the red and white for the first time in his career.

460
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,061
What type of pressure does that come with?

461
00:35:21,248 --> 00:35:25,309
It comes with a lot of pressure, and I think there's a unique mindset that you have to go in.

462
00:35:25,449 --> 00:35:35,653
Yes, you want to acknowledge that, hey, you're in a position that you want to be, but you also have to equally acknowledge you have so much more work to do and simply get hyper-focused on one event at a time.

463
00:35:35,673 --> 00:35:39,194
It's just nice to see an outfit that matches his hair color for the first time.

464
00:35:40,374 --> 00:35:41,755
Hey, the audience said they loved it.

465
00:35:42,975 --> 00:35:45,336
So who's he going to listen to, the crowd or his wife?

466
00:35:46,456 --> 00:35:47,056
We know it's always wife.

467
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:52,150
Always like Jason Hopper in the center lane, Jake Kraus to his left.

468
00:35:53,011 --> 00:35:59,079
Jake Kraus is off the runner first, along with Ricky Garrard and Austin Hatfield.

469
00:36:01,198 --> 00:36:11,263
We saw a lot of this in the first heat as well, where it was very crowded at the bar, quick transition from the runner, many athletes select and opt for a pace that's really similar to one another.

470
00:36:11,283 --> 00:36:16,565
And then we're going to start to see some paces start to settle, as we're already seeing the deadlift rep be broken up.

471
00:36:16,585 --> 00:36:21,888
12 deadlifts at 350 pounds with that big axle bar.

472
00:36:22,768 --> 00:36:26,130
It's Ricky Garrard is trying to keep pace with his countryman, Jay Crouch.

473
00:36:27,313 --> 00:36:30,618
Ricky Garrard is donning the leader jersey last night in the third event.

474
00:36:31,379 --> 00:36:33,241
Lost it in the pegboard to Jason Hopper.

475
00:36:33,261 --> 00:36:37,007
50 feet down, 50 feet back.

476
00:36:37,127 --> 00:36:43,636
Athletes can stop in the middle at that yellow 25-foot halfway mark, but we haven't really seen that until the later rounds due to fatigue.

477
00:36:44,489 --> 00:36:47,331
And that transition was extremely fast here by Jay.

478
00:36:47,391 --> 00:36:50,633
I mean, it was literally looking like the transition of a shuttle run.

479
00:36:50,673 --> 00:36:55,597
His feet touched the ground, and immediately he was right back to those hands and upside down.

480
00:36:55,857 --> 00:37:02,061
Jay Crouch back to the runner, had the second fastest split of all the athletes in the first round at 238.

481
00:37:02,642 --> 00:37:06,064
Ricky Gerrard had the fastest at 236.

482
00:37:08,713 --> 00:37:12,797
And this is where we're really going to start to see some large separation from heat 1 to heat 2.

483
00:37:13,197 --> 00:37:16,139
It's going to be the cyclical speed at which they hold on the woodway.

484
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:23,005
I would argue that Nick Matthew may have some of the faster deadlift splits, even after the event entirely is said and done.

485
00:37:23,245 --> 00:37:25,947
But this is where so much time can be made up on these runners.

486
00:37:26,268 --> 00:37:28,670
And these men all have the fitness to attack it aggressively.

487
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:34,194
Jason Hopper, your overall leader after day one.

488
00:37:34,214 --> 00:37:35,215
Had 300 points yesterday.

489
00:37:35,255 --> 00:37:36,156
We've got 400 points.

490
00:37:38,184 --> 00:37:39,345
on the table today.

491
00:37:39,365 --> 00:37:44,649
As Jason Hopper's looking side to side, trying to catch some run paces.

492
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,131
And I think this makes it harder for Jason.

493
00:37:47,191 --> 00:37:51,614
He's very much one of those athletes that feeds off of the presence and positions of other athletes.

494
00:37:51,915 --> 00:37:53,616
We see him constantly looking left or right.

495
00:37:53,636 --> 00:38:00,841
And here, it's a bit more of a blind experience, as you can only hope to read stride cadence and a bit of body language from knowing where your competitors are.

496
00:38:04,684 --> 00:38:05,365
Jason Hopper.

497
00:38:06,514 --> 00:38:08,716
Lane 8, Roman Krennikov, sitting third overall.

498
00:38:10,838 --> 00:38:14,322
Just a handful of points separate the two.

499
00:38:14,522 --> 00:38:27,715
Four total points, that's one place on the leaderboard as your 2023 CrossFit Games champ, Jeff Adler, is looking to work his way back into that podium contention.

500
00:38:28,416 --> 00:38:29,778
Won the first event of the weekend.

501
00:38:30,783 --> 00:38:36,844
won the first event of the weekend, 2023, second in that 5K, won Helena.

502
00:38:37,125 --> 00:38:45,166
We've got to keep our eyes on Mr. Jeff to see any time there's running present, whether it's mixed modal or single modality, you've got to keep your eyes on what this guy can do.

503
00:38:45,446 --> 00:38:50,108
We know he's got tremendous self-awareness, but he's got a lot of fitness there when it comes to running.

504
00:38:51,328 --> 00:38:52,788
Go from one champ to another.

505
00:38:52,828 --> 00:38:55,629
You're reigning CrossFit Games champion James Sprague.

506
00:38:56,778 --> 00:39:03,760
Last year at the 2024 CrossFit Games, James currently sitting in 8th overall with 196 points.

507
00:39:03,961 --> 00:39:10,363
And to his right is your 2020, 2021, and 2022 Games champ, Justin Medeiros.

508
00:39:12,824 --> 00:39:13,844
Can't miss him in no shoes.

509
00:39:14,144 --> 00:39:15,344
Three champs in one heat.

510
00:39:16,245 --> 00:39:20,506
On to the second round of deadlifts.

511
00:39:21,927 --> 00:39:23,987
Jay making very short work of those deadlifts.

512
00:39:24,568 --> 00:39:25,368
Jay Crouch.

513
00:39:28,878 --> 00:39:32,620
Much faster split on round number two.

514
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:43,506
And this is where even as Saxon mentioned earlier, you kind of settle into that position here in the round two where you've now opened up your lungs, your heart rate's up high.

515
00:39:43,746 --> 00:39:47,608
You can settle into more of what we would consider natural mechanics and intensity there.

516
00:39:48,289 --> 00:39:49,429
You're familiar with this feeling.

517
00:39:49,449 --> 00:39:51,451
That first round sometimes a little awkward in a triple.

518
00:39:51,471 --> 00:39:53,172
You got to get familiar with the flow and the feel.

519
00:39:54,272 --> 00:39:56,774
Jake Crouch is done with round number two.

520
00:39:57,913 --> 00:40:01,417
As he advances to the runner for the third time.

521
00:40:05,561 --> 00:40:07,563
Jay looking sharp and in a great position.

522
00:40:08,844 --> 00:40:10,386
Joined there by Callien Souza.

523
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:16,031
Callien Souza at the bottom part of your screen in lane number 14 is currently sitting second.

524
00:40:17,433 --> 00:40:18,174
In this heat.

525
00:40:18,834 --> 00:40:20,716
You only have two total heats, two heats of 15.

526
00:40:22,713 --> 00:40:26,302
Chasing time to beat set by Nick Matthew at 1809.13.

527
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:31,856
Suzette actually had a great event one finish earlier yesterday.

528
00:40:32,737 --> 00:40:39,039
And again, you're wondering, hey, does he have these marked in his mind and on his scoreboard as opportunity events for him?

529
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:41,620
And if so, can he seize the moment?

530
00:40:42,001 --> 00:40:46,442
More often than not, athletes feel extra pressure, Chase, when they know this can be a home run for me.

531
00:40:46,462 --> 00:40:50,904
This can be a really high-scoring event, because it's not just that I'm going to mix in within the leaderboard.

532
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:53,105
It's like, I've got to take this moment and make it my own.

533
00:40:53,365 --> 00:40:54,945
So we'll see how Sousa can respond to that.

534
00:40:55,125 --> 00:40:56,846
And it's a question you ask athletes all the time.

535
00:40:56,866 --> 00:41:00,427
Do you get more nervous in an event you're going to be bad at or the one you're going to be good at?

536
00:41:01,548 --> 00:41:01,708
Yeah.

537
00:41:03,465 --> 00:41:10,008
Austin Hadfield, 10th last year in his rookie debut at the CrossFit Games.

538
00:41:10,608 --> 00:41:16,750
And his name has also been put in the hat of athletes who could podium, if not win, in his second year.

539
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:20,952
Had a tough finish last night in the pegboard event, like so many did.

540
00:41:20,972 --> 00:41:23,253
There was a lot of chaos in that event.

541
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:28,355
And this is one where he wants to work his way back closer to that podium position.

542
00:41:30,568 --> 00:41:41,917
Yeah, we'll say it a lot through the course of the weekend, but this is how you really challenge the mindset of a champion, a future champion, anyone who wants to stand even close to that podium, is how do you respond to adversity?

543
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:49,603
All of these athletes will experience at some point this weekend, it's going to be a hand tear, it's going to be a miscued tempo, it's going to be some missed reps.

544
00:41:50,163 --> 00:41:50,964
How do they respond?

545
00:41:54,328 --> 00:41:56,289
Jay Crouch looking comfortable there on the right.

546
00:41:56,549 --> 00:42:02,752
All these athletes continually holding a pretty steady cadence from what we've seen from open all the way into this third round.

547
00:42:04,933 --> 00:42:09,875
Jay Crouch is off at the same time as Callie and Sousa, but Sousa has a two-rep lead on Crouch.

548
00:42:12,016 --> 00:42:16,818
And a third set of deadlifts, 12 reps with the axle bar, 350 pounds.

549
00:42:19,259 --> 00:42:20,119
Crouch will break.

550
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,921
Callie and Sousa.

551
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:30,773
Looks less built for deadlifts than he does for running on the air runner with the length of his limbs.

552
00:42:32,395 --> 00:42:34,937
He's got to make that barbell travel a long distance for sure.

553
00:42:35,677 --> 00:42:40,401
But it's Jay kicking up at the same time as Susan on the far side of our screen.

554
00:42:42,002 --> 00:42:42,843
50 feet down.

555
00:42:43,363 --> 00:42:47,907
You can break at the yellow 25-foot mark, but no one's done it intentionally yet.

556
00:42:53,623 --> 00:43:00,744
Crouch and Souza deadlocks in event or round three here in event number four.

557
00:43:02,833 --> 00:43:13,400
often chase, when you're in a position like Jay Crouch, you're looking for your addlers and your hoppers and your athletes that are closer, your Krennikovs to the podium position.

558
00:43:13,921 --> 00:43:22,106
But with this weekend, an athlete like Souza, with 400 points available today, is just as much of a threat as anyone out on the floor, and every point is gonna matter.

559
00:43:22,506 --> 00:43:25,669
So Jay's even looking over his shoulder at the outside lanes as well, it's important.

560
00:43:26,536 --> 00:43:35,809
Jason Hopper tied with Jay Crouch in points, but he's holding that event win tiebreaker he got last night in event number three.

561
00:43:35,829 --> 00:43:44,160
And he's trying to keep pace with your heat leader, who may be able to snatch that jersey off of him in one event.

562
00:43:50,643 --> 00:44:15,713
more on this woodway runner let's go down to mike arsenault so guys have a great vantage point down here on the floor i'm basically looking down the row of woodway runners and watching jay crouch and jason hopper through every round of the run thus far jay crouch's posture has stayed the same he's perfectly upright has a very smooth cadence hopper his stride length is starting to go a little bit on him a little bit more random and he's getting a forward lean so adrian you and i were talking

563
00:44:16,113 --> 00:44:34,656
this morning that that's a sign of you're trying to take that pressure off your hamstrings a little bit and we're seeing Jay Crouch as we move deeper into this event creating more separation between himself and Jason Hopper by having a better run cadence and better posture and a little bit better position through the run portion.

564
00:44:39,132 --> 00:44:42,073
Yeah, Mike, I completely agree with you, even as we see that right here on our screen.

565
00:44:42,133 --> 00:44:47,855
It's like, hey, Hopper now has settled into a more consistent cadence as we get deeper into each run.

566
00:44:48,315 --> 00:44:59,378
The unique thing that's different between he and Jay is that it takes Jason about 100 to 125 meters before he seems comfortable on the runner each round, whereas Jay gets back onto that woodway and looks

567
00:44:59,858 --> 00:45:01,799
just as if he leaves every round.

568
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:05,860
And so that consistency really adds up, because it's going to accumulate in seconds.

569
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:10,582
And within five rounds, five seconds here and six seconds there, really accumulate.

570
00:45:10,602 --> 00:45:13,883
And it's going to be shown on the leaderboard when it comes to the outcome of this event.

571
00:45:14,383 --> 00:45:18,045
Jake Kraus done with his fourth 400 meter.

572
00:45:19,405 --> 00:45:20,506
He's tied in points.

573
00:45:21,986 --> 00:45:27,028
Looking for a little separation between him and Jason Hopper, but he's got to.

574
00:45:28,488 --> 00:45:31,650
Worry about the task at hand, and that's staying ahead of Kaylee and Sousa.

575
00:45:35,792 --> 00:45:38,914
Yeah, and Sousa's been consistent with a shorter rest between these breaks.

576
00:45:39,434 --> 00:45:43,576
Jay takes a very intentional longer break there to break up his repetitions.

577
00:45:44,137 --> 00:45:46,438
Sousa staying a little bit closer to on top of that bar.

578
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:51,741
Crouch is done.

579
00:45:53,749 --> 00:45:58,432
on his fourth hundred foot handstand walk as we approach the 12 minute mark.

580
00:45:59,793 --> 00:46:10,580
You look at the time to be in the upper left corner of your screen, 18, 18.86 by Nick Matthew in the previous heat.

581
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:11,301
50 feet's done.

582
00:46:11,721 --> 00:46:15,804
Kelly and Souza, bottom part of your screen, trying to keep pace with Jay.

583
00:46:15,844 --> 00:46:20,367
He makes it up on the run, but Jay is starting to pull away on the handstand walk.

584
00:46:21,074 --> 00:46:23,175
Yeah, Jay with about a 25-foot lead here.

585
00:46:23,375 --> 00:46:27,536
This is where athletes really have to stay urgent about technical proficiency.

586
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:30,037
They want to stay narrow with their hands and stay long through their hips.

587
00:46:30,337 --> 00:46:34,658
It's going to help them store some energy for the big round that is looming here to finish.

588
00:46:36,138 --> 00:46:37,299
Fourth round is done.

589
00:46:37,319 --> 00:46:39,539
Fifth and final round underway.

590
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:43,620
Jay Crouch trying to hold off that man in the center of your screen, Kalian Souza.

591
00:46:44,721 --> 00:46:46,661
Can Souza make up ground on the run?

592
00:46:47,501 --> 00:46:49,322
More importantly, can he hang on to that barbell?

593
00:46:51,462 --> 00:46:54,786
That is a place that Jay is starting to create some separation.

594
00:46:55,086 --> 00:46:56,948
Souza starts to creep up on the run.

595
00:46:57,288 --> 00:47:04,236
Jay goes a little bigger on the deadlift with a little bigger rest, but it's just enough to sneak in and be to those handstand walks early.

596
00:47:04,796 --> 00:47:07,519
And in this position right now, he is in control.

597
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:12,785
The consistency that Jay Crouch has had yesterday, fifth, third, and fifth.

598
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:15,430
This is exactly what you need to do.

599
00:47:15,691 --> 00:47:17,735
And tell me if you've heard this one before, Adrian.

600
00:47:18,276 --> 00:47:24,548
James Sprague has now moved up into third after being absent for the last 12 minutes.

601
00:47:25,517 --> 00:47:26,677
That's how you play the game.

602
00:47:27,298 --> 00:47:29,639
An athlete like James is very self-aware.

603
00:47:29,679 --> 00:47:42,383
He trains in intervals very often, and he tries to ingrain in himself the ability to what we categorize as negatively split an event or a workout, where you merely get faster as you go, regardless of the task at hand.

604
00:47:42,503 --> 00:47:43,384
Here's how he got here.

605
00:47:43,624 --> 00:47:51,487
In the fourth round, he had the fastest deadlift split at 23 seconds, and he had the fastest handstand walk split at 39 seconds.

606
00:47:53,863 --> 00:47:56,464
James Sprague back on the runner for the fifth time.

607
00:47:57,945 --> 00:48:02,068
Does he have enough time to run down Drake, Crouch, and Kelly and Souza?

608
00:48:02,388 --> 00:48:03,488
And that's the question.

609
00:48:03,528 --> 00:48:09,752
And that can be sometimes the drums of trying to negatively split an event is, did you push too late?

610
00:48:10,252 --> 00:48:11,373
Do you push too soon?

611
00:48:11,393 --> 00:48:14,895
And do you give yourself an opportunity to settle in where you hope to finish the event?

612
00:48:19,078 --> 00:48:29,407
I'll tell you what, nothing fires me up more than seeing a young athlete like Kallion Souza, though, come to take someone's points, regardless of where he's sitting on the leaderboard or where he has expectations to finish this weekend.

613
00:48:29,788 --> 00:48:32,170
He's come to shake some things up for this event, and you'd love to see it.

614
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:39,316
Kallion Souza's home country is from Brazil, but he trains out of the United Arab Emirates at CrossFit Calais.

615
00:48:42,199 --> 00:48:43,380
Jake Crouch is done.

616
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,503
Crouch is breaking up the deadlifts each round.

617
00:48:51,164 --> 00:48:53,566
Does he feel the pressure to hold on on the fifth one?

618
00:48:55,908 --> 00:48:56,889
Jay Crouch will break.

619
00:48:56,929 --> 00:48:59,231
Halley ensues it to the barbell for the first time.

620
00:48:59,912 --> 00:49:06,237
You can see some discomfort settling on Jay's face, which tells me he had a very specific outcome intended for that rep scheme.

621
00:49:07,198 --> 00:49:07,918
He wanted to hit it.

622
00:49:07,938 --> 00:49:09,820
He grinded through it just to make sure he got there.

623
00:49:10,521 --> 00:49:10,701
Yep.

624
00:49:11,630 --> 00:49:19,779
Crouch is done and he is three minutes away and 150 feet from his first event win at the CrossFit Games.

625
00:49:24,728 --> 00:49:32,273
Someone told Jay in the back that I said he may not win an event outright today, but he'll be consistently at the top and he took it personally.

626
00:49:33,073 --> 00:49:37,176
Jay Crouch also took a very short rest after the first 50 feet.

627
00:49:37,236 --> 00:49:45,601
Now remember, in the fifth and final round, there's an extra 50 feet and Crouch breaks for the first time at the halfway mark.

628
00:49:46,662 --> 00:49:48,023
Here comes James Sprague.

629
00:49:51,094 --> 00:49:53,875
James Sprague takes a break at the 25-foot mark.

630
00:49:53,955 --> 00:49:56,637
That lets Jay breathe a little easier.

631
00:49:56,837 --> 00:49:59,018
He's got plenty of time for the time to beat.

632
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:04,240
Crouch is up.

633
00:50:06,922 --> 00:50:08,422
50 more feet to the finish line.

634
00:50:08,763 --> 00:50:10,523
This is where you start to feel that pressure, Chase.

635
00:50:10,543 --> 00:50:11,184
Are you gonna do it?

636
00:50:11,224 --> 00:50:11,864
No, he's gonna break.

637
00:50:11,924 --> 00:50:15,406
It's smart, because that time under tension really starts to add up here.

638
00:50:17,607 --> 00:50:19,628
25 feet left for Jay Crouch.

639
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:32,612
And for the first time in his career, Jay Crouch wins at events, and he'll be donning the white leader jersey.

640
00:50:36,213 --> 00:50:36,673
Wow.

641
00:50:38,174 --> 00:50:41,835
With Callie and Sousa there in second place with such an impressive finish.

642
00:50:42,715 --> 00:50:45,956
That walk across the finish line almost cost him right there.

643
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:48,116
Callie and Sousa was only four seconds behind.

644
00:50:50,057 --> 00:50:50,897
James Sprague.

645
00:50:52,103 --> 00:50:59,428
has plenty of time in the center part of your screen as Jason Hopper in the white leader jersey just finishes his hundred.

646
00:51:00,589 --> 00:51:03,050
And this was much needed by James.

647
00:51:04,491 --> 00:51:12,217
James was outside by a significant margin of your top six.

648
00:51:12,237 --> 00:51:16,259
We have four athletes tied at 240 between fourth and sixth place.

649
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,682
Jason Hopper, 10 feet left.

650
00:51:20,906 --> 00:51:26,869
A little hesitation there, a way to reconcile that by Jason.

651
00:51:26,949 --> 00:51:28,430
Good fight for Hopper.

652
00:51:32,192 --> 00:51:35,814
Jeff Adler working on his final 25 feet.

653
00:51:38,955 --> 00:51:45,839
And just a massive handstand walks as Pepper will get in just ahead of Adler.

654
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,821
Austin Hatfield is also finished.

655
00:51:54,601 --> 00:52:00,043
As Ricky Garrard is trying to get in ahead of Nick Matthews' time of 18.18.

656
00:52:00,463 --> 00:52:10,227
And by the way, this shakes out in where athletes are finishing in every single event.

657
00:52:11,848 --> 00:52:15,009
We said points were precious, point gaps are tight.

658
00:52:20,132 --> 00:52:20,872
They all matter.

659
00:52:21,932 --> 00:52:23,253
And as Harry Lightfoot

660
00:52:26,547 --> 00:52:30,230
with the elegant forward roll there out of the handstand walk.

661
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:34,092
Now Roman Krennikov was sitting in third overall with 256 points.

662
00:52:34,132 --> 00:52:43,979
He was four points behind Hopper and Crouch, 16 points ahead of that four-way tie in points for fourth.

663
00:52:49,438 --> 00:52:50,778
Up and down and all around, Chase.

664
00:52:50,818 --> 00:52:52,559
That's what we can expect all weekend long.

665
00:52:53,239 --> 00:53:01,482
Even after we rev this and we still got 300 available points, it's gonna be how composed can they stay and how do they respond to where they sit on the leaderboard.

666
00:53:03,043 --> 00:53:04,583
Let it go and look forward to what's next.

667
00:53:04,883 --> 00:53:08,044
Three minutes left before we hit that 22 minute time cap.

668
00:53:15,027 --> 00:53:16,187
It's Collin Bossard.

669
00:53:19,028 --> 00:53:25,613
finishes his first 50 feet of his 150 foot handstand walk to finish round five.

670
00:53:30,776 --> 00:53:33,959
What a performance like Haley and Sousa, who's walking with Bossard.

671
00:53:34,959 --> 00:53:37,661
Sousa made up 20 seconds on that last set of deadlifts.

672
00:53:37,941 --> 00:53:41,684
I mean, he came storming on the deadlift, storming on the handstand walk.

673
00:53:42,124 --> 00:53:47,028
We were celebrating for Jay Crouch, and all of a sudden we're like, whoa, he was literally right there.

674
00:53:48,441 --> 00:53:50,403
Final 50 feet for Bossart.

675
00:53:56,948 --> 00:53:58,329
Bossart's rookie debut.

676
00:53:58,369 --> 00:54:02,292
He goes past the 25 and with the crowd behind him, the men for Switzerland.

677
00:54:04,393 --> 00:54:13,300
Will close out his final handstand walk.

678
00:54:17,163 --> 00:54:17,684
But Adrian.

679
00:54:18,856 --> 00:54:19,918
Knock, knock, who's there?

680
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,742
Another Australian wearing a white leader jersey.

681
00:54:22,822 --> 00:54:23,984
This time, it's Jay Crouch.

682
00:54:24,264 --> 00:54:25,586
Replay, Spakibot Road.

683
00:54:26,488 --> 00:54:32,196
Yeah, Mr. Crouch came out with winning on his mind to start day two.

684
00:54:32,637 --> 00:54:33,318
Very focused.

685
00:54:33,959 --> 00:54:38,522
for first place, but of course, we know Mr. Hopper gets to don the red and white because he had an event win.

686
00:54:38,802 --> 00:54:42,885
Well, Jake Crouch said, well, I'm going to go ahead and reconcile that by getting myself one.

687
00:54:43,245 --> 00:54:45,887
And he came out today aggressive on the runner, and it suited him.

688
00:54:46,147 --> 00:54:48,308
He's got the fitness and was able to navigate.

689
00:54:48,669 --> 00:54:51,550
Very beautiful, his pacing through all five rounds.

690
00:54:51,831 --> 00:54:58,495
It was him getting the crowd going here to start this Saturday morning to come across as the victor in the final 25 feet.

691
00:54:58,615 --> 00:55:01,117
And of course, he had some time.

692
00:55:01,817 --> 00:55:02,458
You know the name.

693
00:55:03,078 --> 00:55:03,598
It's Crouch.

694
00:55:03,879 --> 00:55:04,579
Don't be confused.

695
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:05,340
I'm here to win.

696
00:55:07,422 --> 00:55:09,744
Your results of the men's event number four.

697
00:55:09,864 --> 00:55:15,028
Jay Crouch gets his first event win at the CrossFit Games.

698
00:55:15,108 --> 00:55:19,071
And that result will get him his first white leader jersey.

699
00:55:19,412 --> 00:55:20,693
Knees down with Mike Arsenault.

700
00:55:21,617 --> 00:55:29,280
Jay this is your fifth in-person appearance at the CrossFit Games but your first event win and this will be your first time wearing the white leaders jersey.

701
00:55:30,101 --> 00:55:32,462
Why do you think this year has been the year that you've broken through?

702
00:55:33,055 --> 00:55:34,336
Oh, man, it's just the team around me.

703
00:55:34,356 --> 00:55:36,398
I have the best team in the world around me, and that's proven.

704
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:40,302
And yeah, I'm super grateful to have those guys around me.

705
00:55:40,342 --> 00:55:42,144
I looked up to them for a very long time.

706
00:55:42,624 --> 00:55:44,626
So yeah, to call them family is super special.

707
00:55:45,807 --> 00:55:47,409
Yeah, the work I've been putting in.

708
00:55:47,569 --> 00:55:48,931
I've been doing this stuff for a long time.

709
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:54,836
And yeah, to, I guess, prepare the right way that winners do.

710
00:55:55,913 --> 00:55:56,893
And this is the result.

711
00:55:57,594 --> 00:56:03,296
Through four events, you're the only man in the competition to have four performances top five or better.

712
00:56:03,936 --> 00:56:05,436
Where does that consistency come from?

713
00:56:06,317 --> 00:56:06,597
Oh, man.

714
00:56:06,637 --> 00:56:10,658
I feel like that's been a strength of mine for a while, is just being that consistent guy.

715
00:56:10,678 --> 00:56:14,640
But I've never been able to, let's say, make that top step of them being top fives.

716
00:56:16,441 --> 00:56:20,143
Yeah, I mean, you do well in this sport when you don't have any holes.

717
00:56:20,163 --> 00:56:21,884
So yeah, that's where we want to be.

718
00:56:22,524 --> 00:56:28,287
And how much you've been working on that top end squat strength to get ready for another event we have coming up later today?

719
00:56:28,507 --> 00:56:32,068
Again, I don't want to toot my own horn, but back squats are very good for me.

720
00:56:32,108 --> 00:56:34,349
So I'm looking forward to it as a best case scenario.

721
00:56:34,670 --> 00:56:39,232
I feel like Dave's maybe been on my Instagram looking at all my strengths, because these workouts are stacking up pretty good.

722
00:56:40,144 --> 00:56:41,385
doing a little Instagram creeping.

723
00:56:41,425 --> 00:56:42,506
Jay, congratulations.

724
00:56:42,747 --> 00:56:44,228
Go get that White Leaders jersey on.

725
00:56:44,448 --> 00:56:44,929
Thank you, guys.

726
00:56:44,949 --> 00:56:46,210
Shout out to my family back home.

727
00:56:46,250 --> 00:56:46,731
Love you guys.

728
00:56:49,173 --> 00:56:49,533
Adrian.

729
00:56:50,554 --> 00:56:51,255
Toot toot.

730
00:56:51,475 --> 00:56:52,336
Toot toot, baby.

731
00:56:52,396 --> 00:56:54,759
Jay Crouch Chains coming down the tracks, y'all.

732
00:56:55,379 --> 00:56:57,241
The men are done for Individual Event 4.

733
00:56:57,381 --> 00:56:58,482
Don't go anywhere.

734
00:56:58,542 --> 00:57:00,905
The individual women coming up next.

735
01:03:05,663 --> 01:03:10,665
Welcome back inside arena as today's coverage is presented by Belites.

736
01:03:10,965 --> 01:03:14,167
We are Belites and we are made not born.

737
01:03:14,227 --> 01:03:15,087
Good morning, everyone.

738
01:03:15,147 --> 01:03:19,969
As the 2025 CrossFit Games continues here in Albany, New York, I'm Chase Ingram.

739
01:03:20,009 --> 01:03:25,191
Along with me is Adrian Conway and Mike Arsenault will be joining us from the floor.

740
01:03:26,752 --> 01:03:31,734
He's seen it once before, the Albany grip trip presented by Pasture Provisions.

741
01:03:32,885 --> 01:03:44,650
It is five rounds for time, 400-meter run on that Woodway Runner, 12 deadlifts at 220 pounds for the women, and a 100-foot handstand walk, of course, until round five.

742
01:03:45,110 --> 01:03:46,371
You get an extra 50 feet.

743
01:03:47,551 --> 01:03:53,493
Your lane assignments for heat number one of two, as we are going two heats of 15 and 15.

744
01:03:53,854 --> 01:04:01,977
These are your bottom 15 after day one of competition, as we have our second final heat after this.

745
01:04:08,378 --> 01:04:31,623
Your vision fuels victory athletes to watch, and all eyes are on one athlete who makes her 10th and last appearance at the CrossFit Games this year, but she is not alone, as Jona Koski and Tia-Claire Toomey are three athletes that join the 10 Games Club.

746
01:04:31,663 --> 01:04:33,643
And more on Brooke Wells as we go down to Mike Arsenault.

747
01:04:35,452 --> 01:04:39,195
Oh, Adrian, more on Brooke with you, sir.

748
01:04:39,235 --> 01:04:41,436
Yeah, listen, all of us could give you some more on Brooke.

749
01:04:41,456 --> 01:04:44,138
We've gotten 10 years to watch her at a very high level.

750
01:04:44,218 --> 01:04:46,680
She's an athlete that has been a fan favorite.

751
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:51,103
She has also finished as high as fifth two times at the CrossFit Games.

752
01:04:51,823 --> 01:04:53,323
has come back from injury.

753
01:04:53,603 --> 01:04:55,824
We have seen her grow up in the CrossFit space.

754
01:04:55,864 --> 01:04:57,764
So we've got a little bit of it all from Ms.

755
01:04:57,784 --> 01:04:58,264
Brooke Wells.

756
01:04:58,284 --> 01:05:02,365
And it was a shock to me when she announced that this would be her last year competing at the CrossFit Games.

757
01:05:02,405 --> 01:05:06,065
But I can tell you what, she's going to go out fighting tooth and nail for the best finish possible.

758
01:05:07,106 --> 01:05:11,926
One of two underway for individual event number four.

759
01:05:11,946 --> 01:05:14,467
You see Abby Dolmit.

760
01:05:16,247 --> 01:05:18,788
We had a tough day yesterday.

761
01:05:18,848 --> 01:05:20,908
Dolmit, one of the athletes that

762
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:28,411
could be in podium contention this weekend and just not having the, at least day one.

763
01:05:28,451 --> 01:05:32,941
But the good news for Dominic is that there's 400 points up for grabs today.

764
01:05:34,403 --> 01:05:39,687
Yeah, and she's an athlete that you like to consider doing pretty well on an event like this.

765
01:05:39,747 --> 01:05:56,758
We know, historically, she's actually got some back issues that she's dealt with and managed throughout sports as a youth athlete, coming up through gymnastics, something she's had to be mindful of even coming into the sport of CrossFit, as it was almost something that helped strengthen her back and posterior.

766
01:05:57,519 --> 01:06:03,483
So you wonder how she approaches these deadlifts that, of course, she's going to do in high number throughout this event.

767
01:06:05,284 --> 01:06:26,267
400 meter runs on that wood way runner to start See Carolyn Frivo there in lane number two One who knows her way around a deadlift bar Yeah, she knows her way around a deadlift bar chasing anything athletic I mean she's moving quickly through space on a regular basis and she's gonna be a good runner to Gracie Walton

768
01:06:28,014 --> 01:06:29,114
in this first heat.

769
01:06:29,435 --> 01:06:34,817
If you look at what's stacked up later this afternoon, we said there's a lot of points up for grabs.

770
01:06:34,837 --> 01:06:42,940
So what is, we have tonight an event six and seven, maybe an awesome opportunity for Gracie Walton to put herself back into that top 10 position.

771
01:06:45,561 --> 01:06:47,561
Gotta get through this first event of the day.

772
01:06:47,581 --> 01:06:51,783
As Gracie Walton is watching her fellow countrymen.

773
01:06:53,145 --> 01:06:59,068
Donning that white leader jersey, Cristina Lividadakis, qualifying out of the Rebel Renegade Games.

774
01:06:59,108 --> 01:07:10,833
This is her first appearance at the CrossFit Games, as Jennifer Muir is off the runner first, along with Mariana Mesa.

775
01:07:13,174 --> 01:07:15,395
Muir, another rookie out of Scotland.

776
01:07:17,556 --> 01:07:21,457
Muir actually made a little splash in name for herself in the 2020

777
01:07:23,928 --> 01:07:29,512
three semifinals as Brooke Wells is on to the deadlift as well.

778
01:07:29,532 --> 01:07:36,898
Now, if you think prime Brooke Wells, this is a home run potential event for someone like with Brooke's skill set.

779
01:07:37,158 --> 01:07:39,920
You've got running, deadlifts, and a handstand walk.

780
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:41,880
Yes, you do.

781
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:42,681
You've got it all.

782
01:07:43,181 --> 01:07:48,145
And we're starting to see some real variation in regards to who's kicking up and when on this handstand walk.

783
01:07:48,546 --> 01:07:49,687
We talked about it with the men.

784
01:07:49,727 --> 01:07:53,029
We're going to start to see some variance in through the first two rounds.

785
01:07:53,430 --> 01:08:00,856
And then we'll start to see some consistent settling points for these athletes based on pacing of the run and how they navigate all the transitions from the deadlift to the handstand walk.

786
01:08:02,377 --> 01:08:05,980
Mariana Meza on the left side of your screen out of Mexico is your...

787
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:17,607
early lead on the handstand walk as Abby Dahlman in the center lane just passed the CrossFit decal has moved into first place after this first round.

788
01:08:20,269 --> 01:08:21,090
Dahlman is done.

789
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:27,134
Actually looks like lane 10 already on the runners, Gracie Walton.

790
01:08:28,455 --> 01:08:32,658
Yeah, you mentioned her, Chase, and we talked about her a little bit early there on the left of the screen in all black.

791
01:08:33,963 --> 01:08:44,067
Her running stride and cadence, we're getting a great shot of it here, is that it's longer and faster than a lot of the other competitors, and that's what got her that early lead into round one.

792
01:08:44,107 --> 01:08:46,428
We'll see if she sticks with it all the way through five.

793
01:08:48,753 --> 01:08:54,482
Gracie Walton had the fastest deadlift split in the first round of 21 seconds.

794
01:08:54,542 --> 01:08:57,486
She was one of two athletes that looks like they went unbroken.

795
01:08:57,506 --> 01:08:59,169
It was her and Caroline Prevost.

796
01:08:59,650 --> 01:09:04,056
So even though the run's going to take longer, when it comes to pacing, Adrian,

797
01:09:04,577 --> 01:09:06,779
There are still massive opportunities to make up.

798
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:11,683
Because if you can make up 10 seconds on deadlifts, that's 10 seconds you don't have to run faster on the air runner.

799
01:09:11,943 --> 01:09:12,383
That's right.

800
01:09:12,623 --> 01:09:14,085
And it's a double positive.

801
01:09:14,105 --> 01:09:20,950
If you can conserve energy on the runner, although it takes so much time, and then be faster in the transitions, you're going to literally feel better into round four and five.

802
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:24,593
And we see that that plays a huge component in the outcome of this one.

803
01:09:25,333 --> 01:09:33,040
And Gracie Walton, one of those athletes that has the complete understanding, just like we saw with the men, that even if you set the fastest time in heat one,

804
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:39,243
There's 15 other women that are watching exactly what you do, and they'll be willing to make those tweaks and changes in order to get a better time.

805
01:09:39,343 --> 01:09:40,323
I mean, think about the men's.

806
01:09:40,824 --> 01:09:52,370
For the first time in a long time, both men who were leading after the first heat in both heats ended up winning their respective heat between what Nick Matthew did and Jay Crouch.

807
01:09:54,130 --> 01:09:54,971
Lucy McGonigal.

808
01:09:56,667 --> 01:10:15,578
It's her rookie individual debut at the CrossFit Games, but as the youngest athlete competing this weekend, Lucy has two team championships under her belt, and she is one of six athletes competing here this weekend that have team games championships.

809
01:10:16,818 --> 01:10:22,862
Gracie Walton back to the deadlift, went unbroken on round one, and with a hand in the air, takes her first break.

810
01:10:25,467 --> 01:10:27,328
Yeah, and that's what you want to see right there, Chase.

811
01:10:27,428 --> 01:10:30,308
Even when athletes break, that it's short and calculated.

812
01:10:30,328 --> 01:10:32,369
This is what we mean by race the rest.

813
01:10:32,469 --> 01:10:34,109
And there she goes, no hesitation.

814
01:10:34,149 --> 01:10:34,289
Wow.

815
01:10:34,489 --> 01:10:35,130
Right upside down.

816
01:10:36,750 --> 01:10:40,051
Just speaks to the confidence she has in her handstand walkability.

817
01:10:41,011 --> 01:10:46,533
As Gracie Walton is, has top 10 potential.

818
01:10:49,473 --> 01:10:53,114
Had her debut at the CrossFit Games last year.

819
01:10:53,575 --> 01:10:54,975
Gracie Walton out of Australia.

820
01:10:56,807 --> 01:11:03,170
took the event win in Firestorm as Abby Doman is back on the barbell on the left side of your screen.

821
01:11:06,251 --> 01:11:12,054
While she's on the bar, Gracie Walton, after the second round, is already back to the runner.

822
01:11:13,914 --> 01:11:17,496
So fast upside down there by Gracie, we've kind of

823
01:11:19,003 --> 01:11:21,424
generally mentioned the handstand walk in the volume.

824
01:11:21,444 --> 01:11:26,266
550 feet, that's almost two football fields for everybody watching if you want to get a good visual.

825
01:11:26,986 --> 01:11:31,807
And we're taking for granted how high of a skill demand that actually is.

826
01:11:32,308 --> 01:11:36,509
Any crossfitter within the four walls of an affiliate will understand that is a very tough task.

827
01:11:36,569 --> 01:11:40,871
And Gracie Walton is pretty much running not just on the woodway, but also upside down at this point.

828
01:11:41,291 --> 01:11:44,852
Gracie Walton currently sitting in 19th overall.

829
01:11:46,939 --> 01:11:49,001
We have 30 athletes competing.

830
01:11:50,001 --> 01:11:53,884
One of the smallest fields we've ever had at the CrossFit Games on the individual side.

831
01:11:53,924 --> 01:11:57,667
The only other one being 2020, where they took the top 20.

832
01:11:59,789 --> 01:12:06,333
So Gracie Walton is looking to try to get herself closer to that final heat, which traditionally is the top 10.

833
01:12:09,716 --> 01:12:11,837
Brooke Wells has moved into third.

834
01:12:14,007 --> 01:12:15,989
Brooke Wells had a tough day yesterday.

835
01:12:16,049 --> 01:12:20,052
We saw the inability to get up the pegboard in that third and final event last night.

836
01:12:20,072 --> 01:12:21,634
We saw the emotion come out there.

837
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:28,242
how important it is to have maybe a great event for a potential bounce back to get back in the game.

838
01:12:28,282 --> 01:12:31,244
There's a lot of events left to go this weekend.

839
01:12:31,564 --> 01:12:32,744
Yeah, a lot left.

840
01:12:32,804 --> 01:12:36,006
And historically, we know Brooke struggles with upper body pulling, right?

841
01:12:36,046 --> 01:12:40,948
So the pegboard wasn't a huge shock to us, but certainly she expected better than a 20 second.

842
01:12:41,188 --> 01:12:45,049
And she's in this unique situation where she's verbally committed to, hey, this is my last year.

843
01:12:45,350 --> 01:12:48,251
You've got a real unique opportunity here to set yourself up for success.

844
01:12:48,751 --> 01:12:53,433
in day two that can keep you emotionally invested in the fight towards the top.

845
01:12:53,633 --> 01:12:55,774
Because otherwise it could be really easy to check out also.

846
01:12:55,794 --> 01:12:59,635
I speak earlier about this being her 10th and final CrossFit Games.

847
01:13:00,716 --> 01:13:04,477
She has announced her retirement earlier prior to coming in.

848
01:13:04,517 --> 01:13:11,700
She has three event wins under her belt and has finished in the top five twice in her career.

849
01:13:16,644 --> 01:13:18,705
400 meters on those Woodway runners.

850
01:13:19,185 --> 01:13:21,307
This is the third round of five.

851
01:13:21,327 --> 01:13:29,151
As all athletes are chasing, Gracie Walton, who's off the runner, and back to the barbell.

852
01:13:29,171 --> 01:13:31,092
220 pounds on the bar.

853
01:13:35,327 --> 01:13:41,049
Gracie here looking a lot like we saw from Nick Matthew in the earlier heat, where her cycle rate is faster.

854
01:13:41,349 --> 01:13:48,111
She's descending quickly from the top, but it's that bar speed from the ground to lockout that is creating a tremendous advantage for her right now.

855
01:13:49,252 --> 01:13:55,414
Gracie Walton still had the second fastest split on the round two of deadlifts at 22 seconds.

856
01:13:55,474 --> 01:13:58,755
And Prevost has the fastest at 20.

857
01:13:58,795 --> 01:14:04,137
But even with that break, Gracie Walton is still in that mid-20 time frame.

858
01:14:05,590 --> 01:14:06,731
Everyone else is north of 30.

859
01:14:06,851 --> 01:14:14,957
So not only is Walton having a good run, she's got a great deadlift and clearly doing well on the handstand walks.

860
01:14:15,178 --> 01:14:18,060
She had the fastest handstand walk split in round number two.

861
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:21,723
50 more feet for Walton.

862
01:14:23,252 --> 01:14:28,314
Great job there by Gracie, keeping a neutral gaze for her handstand walk, not trying to overarch and look too far ahead.

863
01:14:28,374 --> 01:14:31,215
She's just spotting right between where her hands are going to go.

864
01:14:31,535 --> 01:14:36,557
This helps prevent a lot of that upper neck and upper trap fatigue that a lot of athletes build by looking up too much.

865
01:14:38,338 --> 01:14:43,000
And her fellow Australian, golly, maybe I need to move to Australia if I want to get fitter.

866
01:14:43,740 --> 01:14:44,580
Emily DeRoy.

867
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:45,421
Something in the water.

868
01:14:45,501 --> 01:14:50,783
On the right side of your screen is sitting in second, as Brooke Wells on the left side, holding on to third.

869
01:14:57,185 --> 01:14:58,166
DeRoy on the right.

870
01:15:00,047 --> 01:15:01,669
Brooke Wells wasting no time.

871
01:15:01,709 --> 01:15:04,111
Brooke Wells is a fantastic handstand walker.

872
01:15:07,373 --> 01:15:26,089
Also incredible for her career is that we forget that devastating elbow injury she sustained back in 2021, when it was able to come back the next year in 2022 and still competing at the CrossFit Games.

873
01:15:28,126 --> 01:15:33,269
Yeah, it was extremely impressive to watch the physical recovery by Brooke.

874
01:15:33,429 --> 01:15:37,812
I mean, that's a pure example of the fitness built through years, right?

875
01:15:37,852 --> 01:15:42,495
We talk about fitness being a buffer from sickness and injury, and she had a devastating injury.

876
01:15:42,875 --> 01:15:50,560
But the stability and strength in her upper body and her mental fortitude is what allowed her to have that gracious recovery and get back on the competition floor.

877
01:15:50,720 --> 01:15:57,044
Yeah, just to see her come back, to compete at all in 22, letting them get fifth place at the CrossFit Games that year.

878
01:16:05,552 --> 01:16:06,293
Gracie Walton.

879
01:16:07,654 --> 01:16:11,839
You can see Emily DeRoy in the far left, who's sitting in second.

880
01:16:11,939 --> 01:16:16,585
Two women from Australia are your two leaders in this heat.

881
01:16:17,924 --> 01:16:19,705
And Chase Gracie's face says it all.

882
01:16:19,765 --> 01:16:21,966
She is hyper-focused on her pace.

883
01:16:22,426 --> 01:16:24,247
She knows exactly what she wants to hit.

884
01:16:24,628 --> 01:16:28,810
And of course, I'm sure she's watching the meter tick up towards her end goal.

885
01:16:28,830 --> 01:16:30,951
But she's really watching, how fast am I running?

886
01:16:30,991 --> 01:16:34,273
And what do I need to do to change my body posture and position in order to do that?

887
01:16:34,313 --> 01:16:41,857
Again, another savvy vet move there, chalking her hands up as she gets near concluding this run so that she's ready to grab that barbell and get to the deadlifts.

888
01:16:43,177 --> 01:16:47,683
This is our 19th CrossFit Games, starting all the way back in 2007.

889
01:16:48,243 --> 01:16:53,530
And it feels like the tide is turning with fresh, new blood at the games.

890
01:16:53,570 --> 01:16:57,215
Lucy McGonigal is your youngest athlete in the field.

891
01:16:57,235 --> 01:16:58,716
She's currently sitting in fourth in this heat.

892
01:16:59,297 --> 01:17:01,458
Lydia Fish is sitting in second place.

893
01:17:01,598 --> 01:17:04,699
Anika Greer makes the games for the first time after years of heartbreak.

894
01:17:05,119 --> 01:17:09,521
Miriam Van Wor has won the Open two times in the last two years.

895
01:17:09,661 --> 01:17:17,564
And just to see not only is the future bright in terms of age, but the amount of countries that are being represented with this new batch of athletes.

896
01:17:17,584 --> 01:17:21,526
Yeah, it's really amazing as we even watch Lucy here grind through this run.

897
01:17:22,666 --> 01:17:25,186
These athletes are new here to the competition floor.

898
01:17:25,927 --> 01:17:30,147
They don't got the same kind of life experience as someone that's 35 years old that they're competing against.

899
01:17:30,167 --> 01:17:37,129
So they're learning so much, and they're starting so young in our methodology that it lends itself as a huge advantage.

900
01:17:37,269 --> 01:17:38,429
And that was just the rookies.

901
01:17:38,489 --> 01:17:41,790
Gracie Walton, this is only her second appearance at the CrossFit Games.

902
01:17:44,270 --> 01:17:49,711
She works her way into her fourth handstand walk.

903
01:17:51,823 --> 01:17:53,384
all alone there on the handstand walk.

904
01:17:53,404 --> 01:17:54,624
And that's a good feeling, Chase.

905
01:17:55,044 --> 01:17:56,344
It's not one you often get.

906
01:17:56,384 --> 01:17:57,285
We mentioned this yesterday.

907
01:17:57,325 --> 01:17:59,025
When you're in the lead, it's not one you often get.

908
01:17:59,065 --> 01:18:00,966
Sometimes you get it when you're the last one on the floor.

909
01:18:01,606 --> 01:18:03,066
But this is a really great feeling.

910
01:18:03,086 --> 01:18:06,548
Gracie not taking the time to soak it up, because she's focused.

911
01:18:06,568 --> 01:18:11,229
She knows she's got a lot of work to do left in this one more round that awaits her.

912
01:18:12,809 --> 01:18:13,950
I'm used to the other one.

913
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:16,010
I'm used to being the last one.

914
01:18:17,271 --> 01:18:20,652
Gracie Welln takes a break as Brooke Wells has moved into second place.

915
01:18:22,928 --> 01:18:27,035
Walden takes her first break at that 25 foot yellow mark.

916
01:18:27,515 --> 01:18:33,245
Athletes do not have to do 50 feet unbroken as Walden gets to her final run.

917
01:18:34,662 --> 01:18:39,946
Yeah, Brooke making slight work of those deadlifts, showing that she really has paced it greatly up into this point.

918
01:18:40,667 --> 01:18:47,513
Daru there taking a bit of a longer rest on the right, which shows that she's operating a touch more at her threshold.

919
01:18:47,993 --> 01:18:51,256
Brooke choosing to break up her handstand walks in the 25 foot segments.

920
01:18:51,316 --> 01:19:00,123
Daru has gone unbroken, was able to make up a little bit more time in previous rounds there, but Brooke's in a pretty strong position right now for that second place finish potentially, at least going into round five.

921
01:19:00,343 --> 01:19:02,965
Brooke finished with her first 50-foot handstand walk.

922
01:19:03,025 --> 01:19:08,030
Again, it's 100 total each round except the fifth and final round.

923
01:19:09,011 --> 01:19:11,753
They'll have an extra 50 feet at the end.

924
01:19:12,014 --> 01:19:13,395
Brooke will stop at 25.

925
01:19:13,455 --> 01:19:14,596
DeRoy will go the whole 50.

926
01:19:19,320 --> 01:19:21,882
Brooke Wells closing out her fourth round.

927
01:19:25,908 --> 01:19:49,406
textbook round there by brooke to kind of finish that up we talk about as a recipe to success racing the rest and who we're watching right now gracie walton she hasn't taken much of it at all throughout the course of this event so far the transitions that she's had as well there's the rest during the the movement but the rest between them is a key component especially in a

928
01:19:50,087 --> 01:19:56,451
A three modality event, five rounds is a lot of opportunities to waste time in an event like this.

929
01:19:56,592 --> 01:19:56,992
That's right.

930
01:19:57,032 --> 01:19:58,073
It's very tempting, Chase.

931
01:19:58,093 --> 01:20:02,896
You get off that runner and the last thing you want to do is pick up something heavy, especially when you've already done it 48 times.

932
01:20:03,396 --> 01:20:12,983
But it's the discipline and the tenacity and the attitude of these athletes that is really the deciding factor in how they get into attack mode from movement to movement.

933
01:20:13,143 --> 01:20:19,207
That is something that they have to practice and they have to be very in the moment of in order not to listen to their body.

934
01:20:19,227 --> 01:20:23,130
Because from a comfort perspective, you don't want to advance as quickly as they are.

935
01:20:23,430 --> 01:20:25,112
They're choosing to do it because they want to win.

936
01:20:25,132 --> 01:20:30,876
100 meters left for Gracie Walton on the right side of your screen, your leader in this heat.

937
01:20:32,037 --> 01:20:37,821
Time cap is 25 minutes as Walton is in her fifth and final round.

938
01:20:43,198 --> 01:21:01,702
Brooke Wells on the right her twin sister Sydney who's been a individual games athletes in her own right and her mom looking on never the easy position to be in chase I've competed at the CrossFit Games many times and I think my family's more fatigued at the end of every day than I am.

939
01:21:02,762 --> 01:21:05,443
Gracie Walnes off the run and on the bar

940
01:21:06,697 --> 01:21:12,462
But she's had one of the, continuing to have one of the fastest, deadliest splits of any athlete in this heat.

941
01:21:12,502 --> 01:21:14,123
Again, this is heat number one of two.

942
01:21:14,143 --> 01:21:18,647
So we have two heats of 15 as Walmart break for the second time.

943
01:21:18,687 --> 01:21:20,028
So she has yet to do that.

944
01:21:20,889 --> 01:21:24,672
Maybe setting herself up for the longer handstand walk to close things out.

945
01:21:26,743 --> 01:21:30,345
And simply put, she's at the top end of her threshold right now.

946
01:21:30,385 --> 01:21:32,126
We're seeing it from a body language perspective.

947
01:21:32,146 --> 01:21:34,127
You see the fatigue on her face.

948
01:21:34,587 --> 01:21:37,629
But this is what is asked of you when you're trying to really maximize your output.

949
01:21:37,969 --> 01:21:42,571
She's trying to save just enough for this last 150 feet.

950
01:21:42,591 --> 01:21:48,294
50 feet down and back and one more to finish in the fifth and final round.

951
01:21:48,354 --> 01:21:49,115
Walton is done.

952
01:21:50,915 --> 01:21:55,238
She took a break at the 25 foot mark in the previous round.

953
01:21:56,439 --> 01:22:03,023
And one thing to note, we still have 15 of our top athletes after day one coming up after this.

954
01:22:03,063 --> 01:22:15,491
So though she's well ahead of the other 14 in this heat, she has to understand that there are 15 athletes and coaches watching and using her pace for race strategy.

955
01:22:16,291 --> 01:22:16,731
That's right.

956
01:22:16,771 --> 01:22:25,915
And for the men, we got an opportunity through those two heats to see how much this final 50 feet really does add in extra challenge in this specific event.

957
01:22:25,955 --> 01:22:34,638
So as she gets ready for this final turnaround, there's a lot of pressure here on the time waste right now that she's taking in order to be prepared for the final 50.

958
01:22:37,979 --> 01:22:39,020
17 and a half minutes in.

959
01:22:42,111 --> 01:22:47,752
Gracie Walton makes her final 50 feet as she stops at the 25 foot marker.

960
01:22:49,913 --> 01:22:52,874
25 feet left to go for Gracie Walton.

961
01:23:02,756 --> 01:23:08,617
She'll get across the finish line and the time is set for heat number two.

962
01:23:09,758 --> 01:23:11,238
Another Australian

963
01:23:12,942 --> 01:23:14,862
with a top performance in their heat.

964
01:23:16,863 --> 01:23:25,285
Brooke Wells is off her final set of deadlifts as she's finishing up her first 50 feet of the handstand walk.

965
01:23:25,305 --> 01:23:26,785
Oh, that was her last.

966
01:23:26,825 --> 01:23:32,946
Wow, Brooke Wells closed the gap significantly on that last 150 feet.

967
01:23:36,387 --> 01:23:41,028
Emily DeRoy, I'll give you zero guesses to where she's from.

968
01:23:42,738 --> 01:23:45,679
Another Australian moving into third place.

969
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:49,540
Whoa.

970
01:23:50,520 --> 01:23:51,281
Great save there.

971
01:23:54,041 --> 01:23:54,862
She knows it.

972
01:23:55,362 --> 01:23:57,463
If you've ever walked on your hands at all, you know that feeling.

973
01:23:58,123 --> 01:23:58,843
And that's a scary one.

974
01:24:00,403 --> 01:24:02,304
50 more feet to the finish line for Emily.

975
01:24:03,684 --> 01:24:09,186
Emily making her second appearance at the CrossFit Games as an individual.

976
01:24:09,266 --> 01:24:10,246
She made it back in 2023.

977
01:24:14,535 --> 01:24:23,879
Decided to take a year off, go team, win a CrossFit Games championship on that team, and then make it again as an individual this year.

978
01:24:28,982 --> 01:24:29,882
Deroy is in.

979
01:24:29,902 --> 01:24:37,726
As we have plenty of time before we get to that 25 minute time cap.

980
01:24:39,206 --> 01:24:40,487
That is Lucy McGonigal.

981
01:24:43,102 --> 01:24:44,863
finishing up her final 50 feet.

982
01:24:51,547 --> 01:24:52,948
Great finish for the youngster.

983
01:24:54,369 --> 01:24:55,610
And she's feeling every bit of it.

984
01:24:56,170 --> 01:25:05,135
Lucy Magano has actually been staying with and training with your seven time CrossFit Games champ, Tia Claire Toomey.

985
01:25:07,077 --> 01:25:07,577
Jen Muir.

986
01:25:13,263 --> 01:25:15,004
Working on her final 50 feet.

987
01:25:18,646 --> 01:25:23,289
Jen, you're doing a great job using her lower body as leverage to help propel herself forward.

988
01:25:24,790 --> 01:25:27,972
Gymnasts might say, hey, these CrossFitters, they're bending their knees while they're walking.

989
01:25:27,992 --> 01:25:29,834
Well, yeah, we're walking and we're not performing.

990
01:25:29,854 --> 01:25:34,617
We're trying to cover forward distance and it helps us do it faster when we get that bend in the legs.

991
01:25:38,539 --> 01:25:39,420
Abby Dometz in.

992
01:25:40,708 --> 01:25:47,995
She was trying to outrace to the finish line between her and Lexi Neely.

993
01:25:50,197 --> 01:25:53,661
So we are past that 20-minute mark out of Kanyo.

994
01:25:58,668 --> 01:26:03,072
You can hear how hard these athletes are working.

995
01:26:03,132 --> 01:26:03,612
That's right.

996
01:26:03,672 --> 01:26:08,356
And for those of you that have never walked on your hands, it is an extremely difficult position to breathe in.

997
01:26:08,776 --> 01:26:10,878
Your ribcage is typically expanded a bit.

998
01:26:11,098 --> 01:26:12,700
You've got pressure through your upper body.

999
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:14,001
There's no reprieve.

1000
01:26:14,021 --> 01:26:17,323
And as you try to fill your lungs and exhale smoothly, it doesn't really exist.

1001
01:26:17,684 --> 01:26:18,664
There's a strong bracing.

1002
01:26:18,704 --> 01:26:21,667
And you heard it there from Kanyo as she was trying to make her way to the finish line.

1003
01:26:23,448 --> 01:26:24,549
Lividadakis is done.

1004
01:26:29,825 --> 01:26:35,311
Still have about three or four athletes left onto the floor.

1005
01:26:35,331 --> 01:26:38,054
As Sydney Mikulishin is in.

1006
01:26:38,134 --> 01:26:41,178
So we have Sung Young Choi, Mariana Mesa, and Luisa Marquez.

1007
01:26:44,662 --> 01:26:46,084
Finishing up their final round.

1008
01:26:47,886 --> 01:26:48,447
Choi is in.

1009
01:27:02,259 --> 01:27:06,680
It's hard to find a place for the muscles to recover in this triplet chase.

1010
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:08,581
You see athletes shaking out their arms.

1011
01:27:09,241 --> 01:27:13,582
Their legs are blown up from the deadlift and the running, but still using their arms on the deadlift.

1012
01:27:14,302 --> 01:27:21,104
There's really not a moment of reprieve here.

1013
01:27:21,124 --> 01:27:24,325
25 more feet for the rookie out of Mexico.

1014
01:27:26,826 --> 01:27:29,767
Actually qualified at a far east throw down.

1015
01:27:31,284 --> 01:27:33,464
She trains at a CrossFit Waddox Fitness.

1016
01:27:40,426 --> 01:27:41,326
And Meza is in.

1017
01:27:48,528 --> 01:27:50,668
Final athlete left on the floor, Luisa.

1018
01:27:55,229 --> 01:27:56,229
Luisa Marquez.

1019
01:27:58,230 --> 01:27:59,250
This is more my speed.

1020
01:28:00,624 --> 01:28:07,227
If I want my own alone time, this could define my short career.

1021
01:28:08,047 --> 01:28:08,468
No rush.

1022
01:28:08,488 --> 01:28:09,088
No rush.

1023
01:28:09,108 --> 01:28:09,148
Oh.

1024
01:28:09,408 --> 01:28:11,489
A little camera time.

1025
01:28:11,529 --> 01:28:12,970
Two minutes left before that time cap.

1026
01:28:13,850 --> 01:28:23,954
And for everyone watching at home, too, this is a unique scenario where we run on a stationary propelled erg, right, in the form of this woodway right now.

1027
01:28:26,235 --> 01:28:27,116
We're actually...

1028
01:28:28,446 --> 01:28:30,228
penalized for being a lighter, smaller athlete.

1029
01:28:31,509 --> 01:28:33,831
Mass moves mass when it comes to a stationary erg.

1030
01:28:33,911 --> 01:28:43,640
And so the foot power and drive that you put into this is going to reward you a lot like body weight and power is rewarded on the rower and the biker, because we're not moving our body through space.

1031
01:28:43,940 --> 01:28:49,946
So there's a unique challenge, especially to runners who aren't naturally great runners.

1032
01:28:51,987 --> 01:28:53,329
Final 12 deadlifts.

1033
01:29:02,234 --> 01:29:04,015
We can tell where the sticking point was, though.

1034
01:29:04,576 --> 01:29:06,697
And it was the deadlifts.

1035
01:29:07,017 --> 01:29:08,618
225 pounds on that axle bar.

1036
01:29:08,839 --> 01:29:14,442
One thing, we talked about the thickness in terms of grip, but also the thickness in terms of frontal plane.

1037
01:29:14,803 --> 01:29:15,003
Yeah.

1038
01:29:16,090 --> 01:29:16,610
Absolutely.

1039
01:29:16,730 --> 01:29:20,092
Chase, you're talking about that fixed plane on the side of your body.

1040
01:29:20,113 --> 01:29:33,981
Folks, it's like if we cut her body in half from the side, the closer she can keep it to that line, right down the middle of her body, the lighter it will feel, and the circumference of that bar pushes the load further from the middle of her body, and it makes it feel that much more heavy.

1041
01:29:36,162 --> 01:29:40,405
I feel this deadlift struggle deeply in my bones.

1042
01:29:40,865 --> 01:29:42,726
You got a story for us about that deadlift struggle?

1043
01:29:42,746 --> 01:29:45,448
Listen, I'm trying not to use the word triggered, but we're getting there.

1044
01:29:51,680 --> 01:29:52,821
10 seconds before the cap.

1045
01:29:53,281 --> 01:29:54,362
Come on, finish these deadlifts.

1046
01:30:03,587 --> 01:30:09,951
One final rep in for Luisa Marquez as Gracie Wong takes the heat.

1047
01:30:09,971 --> 01:30:13,533
18 minutes flat, .39 seconds.

1048
01:30:14,274 --> 01:30:17,676
Let's check out the highlights brought to you by Rogue Fitness.

1049
01:30:18,910 --> 01:30:22,873
It was a lot of Gracie Walton the entire event.

1050
01:30:23,273 --> 01:30:25,915
She came to play today, a lot like did Jay Crouch.

1051
01:30:26,376 --> 01:30:30,559
And just like the other heat winners, she's chalking up those hands on the run.

1052
01:30:30,899 --> 01:30:36,483
Another savvy vet move that allowed her to move quickly in and out of each and every transition, which we talked about, Chase.

1053
01:30:36,763 --> 01:30:37,904
There were a lot of them in this.

1054
01:30:38,024 --> 01:30:44,449
It takes mental fortitude and a high level amount of intention in order to race the rest here.

1055
01:30:44,669 --> 01:30:48,512
And she did it just like we talked about, all the way over that finish line.

1056
01:30:48,852 --> 01:30:51,376
No particular movement presented a problem for Gracie, not today.

1057
01:30:51,476 --> 01:30:53,559
And we got another Australian Heat winner.

1058
01:30:53,999 --> 01:30:55,001
Surprise, surprise.

1059
01:30:55,221 --> 01:31:03,332
The results for Heat number one, Gracie Walton, 18 minutes, 0.39 seconds, as we have two Australians in the top three.

1060
01:31:03,712 --> 01:31:05,996
One Australian on the top of the leaderboard is coming up next.

1061
01:31:52,506 --> 01:31:52,873
Okay.

1062
01:32:04,291 --> 01:32:09,774
Welcome back inside MVP Arena here in Albany, New York for the 2025 CrossFit Games.

1063
01:32:09,954 --> 01:32:12,515
One heat down, one heat left to go.

1064
01:32:12,635 --> 01:32:13,555
I'm Chase Ingram.

1065
01:32:13,595 --> 01:32:15,136
Along with me is Adrienne Conway.

1066
01:32:15,576 --> 01:32:18,998
Mike Arsenault will be joining us shortly from the floor.

1067
01:32:19,438 --> 01:32:22,660
And Tia Claire Toomey makes her way out on the competition floor.

1068
01:32:23,400 --> 01:32:30,390
Two event wins to start, but that 16th place might make her a little angry to start day number two.

1069
01:32:30,631 --> 01:32:38,683
Brother, if I'm a Woodway right now, or if I'm a barbell out there that's a fat barbell, I'm a little afraid of what Tia Claire Toomey is about to do right now.

1070
01:32:39,063 --> 01:32:46,328
T. Claire Toomey had a little struggle on the pegboard and the only thing I heard from her thoughts about that is that she was just angry at herself for how that went.

1071
01:32:46,368 --> 01:32:52,472
She holds a six point lead over rookie Lydia Fish and Lucy Campbell tied at 236.

1072
01:32:55,217 --> 01:32:58,678
This is what awaits for the Women Air Event number four.

1073
01:32:58,718 --> 01:33:02,919
It is Albany Grip Trip, presented by Posture Provisions.

1074
01:33:03,159 --> 01:33:12,202
And it's going to be five rounds for time of a 400 meter run on that woodway, 12 deadlifts at 220 pounds, and a 100 foot handstand walk in 50 foot segments.

1075
01:33:12,522 --> 01:33:14,802
Except round five, they get an extra 50 feet.

1076
01:33:15,142 --> 01:33:17,283
Adrian, what are your tempo recipe for success?

1077
01:33:18,700 --> 01:33:22,085
We're going to look at keeping your cadence, and that's going to specifically talk to that woodway.

1078
01:33:22,125 --> 01:33:23,007
It's a blind run.

1079
01:33:23,047 --> 01:33:24,349
You don't get to race the field here.

1080
01:33:24,409 --> 01:33:25,711
You've got to stick to your guns.

1081
01:33:25,971 --> 01:33:27,133
And then you're going to race the rest.

1082
01:33:27,153 --> 01:33:29,056
We saw in heat one from Gracie Walton.

1083
01:33:29,377 --> 01:33:32,501
She made fast transitions at each and every opportunity.

1084
01:33:33,847 --> 01:33:41,756
Your lane assignments for the second and final heat for individual event number one is we have 15 in each heat.

1085
01:33:41,837 --> 01:33:48,665
Your leader will be in lane number nine, bracketed by Lucy Campbell and Lydia Fish, who are tied with 236 points and more on the rookie.

1086
01:33:51,902 --> 01:33:55,003
Let's go down to Mike Arsenault.

1087
01:33:55,123 --> 01:33:56,044
Where can you be?

1088
01:33:56,664 --> 01:34:01,405
Chase, great to be here in a school of fish with Lydia Fish's support system.

1089
01:34:02,166 --> 01:34:05,387
16 people strong are here from Wisconsin supporting the rookie.

1090
01:34:05,407 --> 01:34:12,209
She was the last chance qualifier, making the most of that opportunity, finding herself in a podium position after day one of the CrossFit Games.

1091
01:34:12,489 --> 01:34:13,770
She's excited to be here.

1092
01:34:14,130 --> 01:34:17,712
I've been talking to her brothers, three brothers beside me, sister behind me.

1093
01:34:18,192 --> 01:34:20,594
And a big focus of Lydia has been her strength.

1094
01:34:20,634 --> 01:34:22,995
So strength is going to be a big portion of day two.

1095
01:34:23,075 --> 01:34:25,256
So we'll see how she acquits herself.

1096
01:34:25,736 --> 01:34:29,559
She just started CrossFit in 2019 after winning a free three-month membership.

1097
01:34:29,819 --> 01:34:35,502
And the rest of the siblings have started CrossFit as well because the brothers told me they can't have their sister stronger than her.

1098
01:34:35,762 --> 01:34:37,083
So it's now a family affair.

1099
01:34:37,983 --> 01:34:38,804
Thank you, Mike.

1100
01:34:38,984 --> 01:34:40,725
And Lydia Fish, the rookie.

1101
01:34:42,201 --> 01:34:48,265
Debuting the CrossFit Games, and then on the second day of competition, you're lining up for the seven-time CrossFit Games champ, Tia Claire Toomey.

1102
01:34:48,905 --> 01:34:53,348
Yeah, high nerves, high stakes, but you're soaking it in, loving every moment of it.

1103
01:34:53,768 --> 01:34:55,169
Lydia Fish, go get it.

1104
01:35:03,694 --> 01:35:08,577
Second and final heat for the individual women for the Albany Grip Trip.

1105
01:35:09,522 --> 01:35:39,070
Haley Adams sitting in lane 15 currently 14 overall and Lucy Campbell back for the first time since 2022 after a two-year fight of a wrist injury just to get back to function and now she's here competing in her second CrossFit game she's tied in points for six points behind the woman on her left in the red and white Tia Claire Toomey

1106
01:35:41,425 --> 01:35:48,550
declare to me taking a 16th place finish last night won the first two events yesterday to start things off and

1107
01:35:49,683 --> 01:35:54,467
Agent not to pull out a Michael Jordan reference, but I think she might have taken that 16th place personally.

1108
01:35:55,068 --> 01:36:07,959
Yeah, isn't it unique that we're in such a fortunate situation with an athlete that we've been able to watch through the years like Tia Claire Toomey that goes 1-1-16 yesterday, still donning the leader jersey, and we're like, yo, she's going to be angry today.

1109
01:36:08,619 --> 01:36:10,461
And that's just the sum of her whole career, right?

1110
01:36:10,481 --> 01:36:17,127
The dominance and the high level of expectation that she's blessed us with for her as an athlete is because of her greatness.

1111
01:36:18,246 --> 01:36:20,548
10th year competing at the CrossFit Games.

1112
01:36:20,588 --> 01:36:23,471
She finished second twice to start her career.

1113
01:36:25,633 --> 01:36:31,037
As Tia is going for eight CrossFit Games championships.

1114
01:36:31,198 --> 01:36:34,741
And you hear this a lot from people that, you know,

1115
01:36:36,576 --> 01:36:41,198
Grit and groan about Tia's dominance and what that means to the sport.

1116
01:36:41,418 --> 01:36:48,620
I can't say it enough how lucky we are to be witnessing such greatness for so long.

1117
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:51,441
And personally, I'm here to see more of it as long as she can.

1118
01:36:52,648 --> 01:36:54,930
Yeah, what can we do to lure her into continuing this?

1119
01:36:55,190 --> 01:36:56,271
I'm all for chase.

1120
01:36:56,291 --> 01:37:02,256
So if it's something that we need to say on the broadcast, something we need to call out, let's go ahead and do that so we can get more of this.

1121
01:37:02,576 --> 01:37:10,002
Amy Kringle on the right and all black is actually first off the runner into the bar along with Lucy Campbell to her left and Tia Toomey in the white and red.

1122
01:37:13,424 --> 01:37:15,006
Now we saw great performance.

1123
01:37:16,377 --> 01:37:23,099
yesterday from a lot of these athletes from the running event to start, as we see Tia get an early start on her handstand walk.

1124
01:37:23,819 --> 01:37:26,619
So will this all be reflected on the pace that they settle in on the woodway?

1125
01:37:26,639 --> 01:37:31,020
I'm very curious about for the athletes that are in the top three right now.

1126
01:37:31,180 --> 01:37:37,502
Now, very early in Tia Claire Toomey's career, handstand walks were not her best movement.

1127
01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:41,783
But you can bet that she has been focusing on improving that.

1128
01:37:41,843 --> 01:37:45,944
And with Shane Orr in her corner, you can guarantee that that is a

1129
01:37:47,425 --> 01:37:54,649
element that they have worked on significantly as Tia Claire Toomey has already moved into first place after the first round.

1130
01:37:55,029 --> 01:38:03,054
When we talk about that with Lucy Campbell as well, Chase, with the wrist injury and limitations, she hadn't been walking on her hands and accumulating a ton of volume and training there for that long.

1131
01:38:03,114 --> 01:38:07,397
So how will she respond to this type of test is going to be a great question as well.

1132
01:38:08,297 --> 01:38:15,342
Olivia Kerstetter on the right side of screen, known, obviously, for her proficiency with the barbell.

1133
01:38:15,402 --> 01:38:18,285
But Kerstetter is fantastic on her hands.

1134
01:38:18,925 --> 01:38:20,006
Fantastic on her hands.

1135
01:38:20,526 --> 01:38:28,612
And we saw earlier, even on the men's side, that if you're fast on the barbell, you can make up a tremendous amount of time that it could cost you on the run.

1136
01:38:28,853 --> 01:38:33,796
So this is going to be a really good balance triplet for Olivia to make a push toward the top of the finish.

1137
01:38:33,816 --> 01:38:36,819
Tia Claire Toomey.

1138
01:38:38,753 --> 01:38:42,575
Still held on to that leader jerseys, even with that 16th place finish.

1139
01:38:42,595 --> 01:38:46,377
And we talked about her quest, her chase for eight.

1140
01:38:47,077 --> 01:38:50,999
These are some of the great eights with seven plus championships.

1141
01:38:51,039 --> 01:38:52,199
Obviously, you have Bill Russell with 11.

1142
01:38:52,700 --> 01:38:53,720
I mean, look at these names.

1143
01:38:53,840 --> 01:38:59,022
Don't tell me you don't want to see these people do more of what they're the best at longer in their career.

1144
01:38:59,863 --> 01:39:01,704
And it's such a treat to have her at seven.

1145
01:39:03,104 --> 01:39:06,226
And that quest for eight is alive and well.

1146
01:39:08,120 --> 01:39:10,862
And look at the names that she's being associated with.

1147
01:39:11,842 --> 01:39:12,042
Yeah.

1148
01:39:12,983 --> 01:39:14,143
I don't know if we have one officially.

1149
01:39:14,183 --> 01:39:15,544
Do we got a CrossFit Hall of Fame chase?

1150
01:39:15,724 --> 01:39:20,167
Listen, your 20 sounds like a good idea to maybe bust that out.

1151
01:39:20,187 --> 01:39:23,428
Maybe Mount Rushmore of CrossFit Games athletes.

1152
01:39:24,509 --> 01:39:25,269
Yeah, it's time.

1153
01:39:25,629 --> 01:39:29,732
It's time.

1154
01:39:29,752 --> 01:39:35,015
18 minutes flat, 0.39, said by Gracie Walton in the previous heat.

1155
01:39:35,055 --> 01:39:37,316
Haley Adams is holding on a second.

1156
01:39:38,609 --> 01:39:39,229
in this heat.

1157
01:39:40,890 --> 01:39:46,872
Haley, someone that has worked on her strength and power tremendously, specifically in the squatting form.

1158
01:39:46,972 --> 01:39:51,813
Through her years, Haley was actually able to compete at a very high level when it comes to hinging.

1159
01:39:51,833 --> 01:39:55,635
And when we talk about movements, the deadlift categorizes as a hinge.

1160
01:39:55,755 --> 01:40:02,857
And so this is one of those, coupled with the run and the handstand walk that she is also going to be extremely competitive at.

1161
01:40:03,683 --> 01:40:06,324
And Haley Adams' career is quite incredible.

1162
01:40:06,404 --> 01:40:15,168
She took second twice as a teen, won it in her last year, and she's one of six athletes with a teen championship under her belt.

1163
01:40:15,248 --> 01:40:17,569
But here's her finishes at the games as an individual.

1164
01:40:18,249 --> 01:40:20,990
Sixth, fifth, ninth, and fifth.

1165
01:40:25,018 --> 01:40:43,199
and Haley is incredible on her hands and with the way this is put together as far as the programming is that yes if you're the best at all of them that's your best case scenario but there is room to maybe mask some deficiencies with the run the deadlift and the handstand walk

1166
01:40:44,251 --> 01:40:45,552
Yeah, and that's what we're really looking for.

1167
01:40:45,612 --> 01:40:50,515
When it comes to a beautiful layout of movements and modalities pieced together, this is one of them.

1168
01:40:51,336 --> 01:40:54,678
Because you could pick any one of these movements and say, oh, that's my thing.

1169
01:40:55,319 --> 01:40:56,520
But then what about the other two?

1170
01:40:56,620 --> 01:41:00,182
Or maybe one is really poor for you, but you can then make up ground on the other two.

1171
01:41:00,242 --> 01:41:02,043
So we're seeing it all play out here.

1172
01:41:02,063 --> 01:41:06,767
And it's going to be the winner, of course, is going to be the one that can piece it all together and compete at the highest level.

1173
01:41:08,131 --> 01:41:12,396
here is done hot on her heels as Haley Adams and Olivia Kerstetter.

1174
01:41:13,297 --> 01:41:18,382
As Haley is a fantastic runner she looks over her shoulder to see where she's at with the rest of the field is.

1175
01:41:20,284 --> 01:41:27,912
As good as she is as a runner she's fantastic on her hands as the Haley Adams fan club in the stands cheering her on.

1176
01:41:31,163 --> 01:41:35,444
You can see that cadence difference between Tia Claire Toomey and Haley Adams.

1177
01:41:36,104 --> 01:41:44,446
Yeah, Tia much more of that faster, shorter stride length, Haley being a little bit more elongated and relaxed.

1178
01:41:46,067 --> 01:41:54,849
Tia likely going to have an attack mode where she's going to be increasing the pace of this run as she goes, especially as she finds herself in the driver's seat.

1179
01:41:57,619 --> 01:42:05,081
Lucy Campbell still in the mix, currently sitting in third overall with that tie between her and Lydia Fish.

1180
01:42:07,201 --> 01:42:23,585
As Lucy peeking over to the, trying to get a peek at Tia Claire Toomey's screen, seeing what pace she's at, and with the endurance background that Lucy Campbell has, she's on the national swim team there in the UK.

1181
01:42:26,799 --> 01:42:28,340
Running should not be an issue.

1182
01:42:28,820 --> 01:42:34,304
But as you said, it's more just time being able to get upside down since recovering from that wrist injury.

1183
01:42:35,284 --> 01:42:35,945
Yeah, for sure.

1184
01:42:36,045 --> 01:42:42,028
And just considering her involvement in CrossFit as a methodology, as coach, as teacher.

1185
01:42:42,428 --> 01:42:43,269
As a broadcaster.

1186
01:42:43,449 --> 01:42:44,650
As a broadcaster.

1187
01:42:44,730 --> 01:42:47,852
It's her specialty is literally not specializing.

1188
01:42:47,892 --> 01:42:52,034
And so she has an opportunity here to really showcase that in this triplet.

1189
01:42:54,236 --> 01:42:56,237
Lucy Campbell training at a CrossFit Nottingham.

1190
01:42:59,696 --> 01:43:08,260
See Olivia Kerstetter, who's in about third place coming into this second round as we are in the midst of the third.

1191
01:43:13,143 --> 01:43:22,648
Kerstetter at her second individual games, but it'd been a multiple team and Lucy Campbell has made up a ton of ground on the third run.

1192
01:43:31,705 --> 01:43:35,168
Lucy Campbell on the right side in the pink and black just to her left.

1193
01:43:35,268 --> 01:43:40,132
Seven-time CrossFit Games champ Tia Toomey and Lucy Campbell has moved into first.

1194
01:43:41,113 --> 01:43:42,955
Tia Claire Toomey hot on her heels.

1195
01:43:45,497 --> 01:43:49,040
We talked about that handstand walk being a big decider here.

1196
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:51,282
We questioned how prepared is Lucy.

1197
01:43:51,502 --> 01:43:54,005
She's looking extremely prepared, very efficient.

1198
01:43:55,515 --> 01:44:01,159
Tia might have her a little bit in regards to speed, but we've got so much further to walk.

1199
01:44:01,179 --> 01:44:02,900
That's less of a concern right now.

1200
01:44:02,960 --> 01:44:05,582
It's Lucy keeping her close so that she has a chance.

1201
01:44:10,525 --> 01:44:18,871
And here's the thing with Lucy is that she is not afraid of anybody out there on the competition floor, even though this is only her second time in the CrossFit Games.

1202
01:44:18,891 --> 01:44:19,812
Obviously, Tia's 10th.

1203
01:44:21,452 --> 01:44:25,335
But what we've seen Lucy do this year, yes, she competed in 2022.

1204
01:44:25,375 --> 01:44:33,342
She won two events at the CrossFit Games, so she has beaten stiff competition over the years.

1205
01:44:34,263 --> 01:44:36,825
Kerstetter moving into third on the right side of your screen.

1206
01:44:37,906 --> 01:44:41,629
Lucy made up a lot of ground on that last run.

1207
01:44:43,399 --> 01:44:50,125
About four seconds on the run on Tia and two on the handstand walk, on the deadlifts.

1208
01:44:50,505 --> 01:44:51,426
And that might be it.

1209
01:44:51,486 --> 01:44:57,150
We know her handstand walks may take a hit just because she hasn't been able to train that over the last two years.

1210
01:44:57,230 --> 01:45:02,555
However, there's opportunities on the board to make up for what she could lose in the handstand walk.

1211
01:45:03,075 --> 01:45:06,498
That's right, and that's what it's all about in regards to competing head-to-head.

1212
01:45:07,039 --> 01:45:09,160
You've got to know where the juice is worth the squeeze.

1213
01:45:09,761 --> 01:45:20,050
And if she's feeling good on the runner, and she's feeling good on those deadlifts, that is a great opportunity for her going into this next round to potentially try to have a slight lead going upside down.

1214
01:45:20,410 --> 01:45:27,477
Just past the 10-minute mark, the time to beat is 18 minutes as Hayley Adams has moved back into third place on the left side of your screen.

1215
01:45:28,097 --> 01:45:32,881
And it seems like it's her and Olivia Kerstetter back and forth a little bit between third and fourth place.

1216
01:45:33,242 --> 01:45:39,307
And it's where Haley gets back on that runner and is able to get a little bit more momentum past Olivia where she sneaks back into that third position.

1217
01:45:41,509 --> 01:45:48,114
Lydia Fish finishing up her third set on the handstand walk.

1218
01:45:49,255 --> 01:45:51,958
She's a good runner, great at gymnastics.

1219
01:45:54,368 --> 01:45:59,209
We know that deadlift at that weight with that bar will be a tough point for her.

1220
01:45:59,229 --> 01:46:04,030
She had a great performance last night with a front squat clean complex.

1221
01:46:05,190 --> 01:46:09,371
Yeah, actually impressed me tremendously the way that she moved those final two barbells, Chase.

1222
01:46:10,211 --> 01:46:13,251
And this is where we talk about strength through years and fitness through years.

1223
01:46:13,291 --> 01:46:18,292
These young athletes have to expedite the process in order to try to catch up on the strength side of things.

1224
01:46:18,652 --> 01:46:22,593
And what we know for an athlete like that is that even

1225
01:46:23,775 --> 01:46:28,499
Her experience on that runner gets harder because of how difficult the deadlifts actually are.

1226
01:46:31,982 --> 01:46:39,968
Lucy Campbell back to the barbell, has made up a little bit of that ground she lost in the handstand walk to Tia Toomey.

1227
01:46:39,988 --> 01:46:48,535
Though Tia Toomey is moving that bar a little quicker on this fourth round as Haley Adams on the left side of your screen, still holding on to third place.

1228
01:46:51,362 --> 01:46:54,469
And looks like Lucy Campbell's just gonna hold on to the bar.

1229
01:46:54,569 --> 01:46:55,351
Let's go.

1230
01:46:56,513 --> 01:46:58,297
Wasting no time overhead.

1231
01:46:59,860 --> 01:47:01,904
Forcing the pace for Tia Toomey.

1232
01:47:04,994 --> 01:47:09,577
What I like about Lucy's walk is that she softens her elbow in order to get her cadence forward.

1233
01:47:09,837 --> 01:47:10,518
There's bend there.

1234
01:47:10,558 --> 01:47:12,619
She's able to keep her hands a little bit more underneath her.

1235
01:47:12,959 --> 01:47:15,561
Tia decides to almost waddle her walk.

1236
01:47:15,901 --> 01:47:17,542
She pivots her shoulder slightly.

1237
01:47:17,762 --> 01:47:19,443
This is just a little bit of energy bleed.

1238
01:47:19,483 --> 01:47:21,565
And both these women are at their threshold.

1239
01:47:21,605 --> 01:47:21,925
Yeah!

1240
01:47:22,165 --> 01:47:22,866
Here we go, baby!

1241
01:47:22,906 --> 01:47:23,526
Let's go!

1242
01:47:27,769 --> 01:47:33,993
Now, Tia has been walking faster than Lucy, but Lucy is starting to pull away, and Tia breaks!

1243
01:47:38,784 --> 01:47:42,285
Lucy Campbell is done as she starts round number five.

1244
01:47:45,686 --> 01:47:46,547
This is her opportunity.

1245
01:47:46,587 --> 01:47:47,047
Here we go.

1246
01:47:49,187 --> 01:47:56,210
She's got to put significant distance between her and Tia, because you always have to question, Chase, how fast is Tia going to run here?

1247
01:47:56,790 --> 01:48:02,632
And how much will this extra 50 feet coming up affect everything towards the end of this event?

1248
01:48:12,767 --> 01:48:20,109
Lucy Campbell was tied in points for second place with 236.

1249
01:48:20,289 --> 01:48:27,850
Tia Claire Toomey is in first place with 242.

1250
01:48:32,431 --> 01:48:36,592
Lucy Campbell, if she holds onto this, can put herself solidly in second.

1251
01:48:38,620 --> 01:48:47,542
And if Tia holds on as well, she'd be two points back of the seven-time CrossFit Games champ.

1252
01:48:49,302 --> 01:48:51,863
Chase, we talk about this comeback from Lucy Campbell.

1253
01:48:51,923 --> 01:49:06,606
I saw her compete at elite competitions this year, standing on top of the podium against other CrossFit Games competitors that are historied, even previous champs like Laurel Horvath.

1254
01:49:07,588 --> 01:49:09,550
besting them in person events.

1255
01:49:10,470 --> 01:49:16,415
And that really put me on notice of her mindset and her competitive advantage that she brings when it's time to compete in person.

1256
01:49:16,615 --> 01:49:17,796
And we're getting to witness it right here.

1257
01:49:17,816 --> 01:49:18,837
She goes head to head with the champ.

1258
01:49:19,057 --> 01:49:21,119
Lucy Campbell's been faster on the run.

1259
01:49:21,159 --> 01:49:23,861
She went unbroken on her fourth set of deadlifts.

1260
01:49:23,901 --> 01:49:26,823
Again, that is a thick bar and it's 220 pounds.

1261
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:29,745
Can Lucy Campbell hold on?

1262
01:49:30,686 --> 01:49:32,728
It's one thing to chase down the champ.

1263
01:49:33,388 --> 01:49:35,310
It's another thing to be chased by the champ.

1264
01:49:40,457 --> 01:49:41,937
50 meters left for Lucy Campbell.

1265
01:49:44,758 --> 01:49:45,558
She's focused, Chase.

1266
01:49:45,598 --> 01:49:47,438
Body language still looks very positive.

1267
01:49:47,818 --> 01:49:48,638
Tia's focused.

1268
01:49:48,658 --> 01:49:51,059
She knows exactly where she wants to be or where she wants to hold.

1269
01:49:52,379 --> 01:49:54,940
Lucy Campbell went unbroken on her fourth set.

1270
01:49:56,060 --> 01:49:59,740
The efficiency of Lucy's deadlifts all event long have been extremely impressive.

1271
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:08,482
Narrow stance with her feet, getting her feet directly under her hips, softens her upper back, not as a fault, but as an advantage to get the bar to the ground quicker.

1272
01:50:10,035 --> 01:50:14,698
Lucy Campbell with the crowd at her back is going to try to go unbroken again as she does.

1273
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:23,945
150 feet stand between her and her third event win at the CrossFit Games.

1274
01:50:27,908 --> 01:50:28,969
Tia takes a break.

1275
01:50:30,249 --> 01:50:36,274
Lucy Campbell going for unbroken on her first 50 foot handstand walk.

1276
01:50:41,224 --> 01:50:42,205
This is where she gets a chance.

1277
01:50:42,225 --> 01:50:43,305
She's like, okay, I've got time.

1278
01:50:43,345 --> 01:50:44,486
I've got some space here.

1279
01:50:46,187 --> 01:50:48,009
Lucy Campbell kicks up again.

1280
01:50:49,169 --> 01:50:50,891
Tia Clare Toomey on her hands.

1281
01:50:51,031 --> 01:50:55,073
Tia Clare broke at the 25 foot mark in the last round.

1282
01:50:55,854 --> 01:50:57,555
Lucy Campbell going for another 50.

1283
01:50:58,135 --> 01:51:04,520
Now remember, we have one more 50 foot section in the fifth and final round.

1284
01:51:05,908 --> 01:51:08,790
Lucy has plenty of time for the time to beat.

1285
01:51:09,390 --> 01:51:11,632
She just has to focus on Tia.

1286
01:51:12,813 --> 01:51:14,714
Lucy Campbell's on her hands again.

1287
01:51:18,356 --> 01:51:23,079
Lucy Campbell has been at a competition for two years.

1288
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:26,582
She's won three events.

1289
01:51:27,697 --> 01:51:38,361
Since she's returned, she's beat a previous champ and the Queen Slayer, Lucy Campbell, takes down another one!

1290
01:51:48,744 --> 01:51:54,246
Haley Adams is trying to catch Tia because Tia got a no rep on her second lap.

1291
01:51:55,669 --> 01:51:57,690
Tia still has 50 feet to go.

1292
01:51:59,471 --> 01:52:01,952
And it's the accumulation of that inverted position, Chase.

1293
01:52:02,292 --> 01:52:09,516
And Haley Adams is the four points that Lucy Campbell needed.

1294
01:52:09,536 --> 01:52:15,078
25 feet left to go for Tia Clare.

1295
01:52:16,539 --> 01:52:24,323
She will not be in white and red much longer after this, as Tia may be getting past

1296
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:32,082
As she does not get to the finish line, she's gotta look out for Kerstetter.

1297
01:52:33,302 --> 01:52:34,903
Five feet left to go for Tia.

1298
01:52:34,923 --> 01:52:40,066
Tia will get third in the events.

1299
01:52:41,326 --> 01:52:44,228
The point drop is four per place.

1300
01:52:48,070 --> 01:52:54,033
Lucy Campbell with six points back coming into this event as Kerstetter has crossed the finish line.

1301
01:52:59,564 --> 01:53:03,446
Ariel Lohan, work on her handstand walk.

1302
01:53:03,827 --> 01:53:09,470
We're at the 18, we still have seven minutes before we hit the 25 minute cap.

1303
01:53:11,271 --> 01:53:17,675
Amy Kringle, takes a break at 25 and here comes Ariel Lohan.

1304
01:53:22,578 --> 01:53:24,840
It's a race to the finish.

1305
01:53:26,338 --> 01:53:28,578
between Campbell and Kringle.

1306
01:53:29,419 --> 01:53:31,259
Brandon across at the same time.

1307
01:53:31,279 --> 01:53:32,799
Daniel Brandon.

1308
01:53:33,979 --> 01:53:41,081
So three athletes right there at the finish line with Ariel Lohan, Kringle, Brandon, and Sturt.

1309
01:53:44,542 --> 01:53:45,802
Wow, what a race.

1310
01:53:46,782 --> 01:53:47,782
What a race.

1311
01:53:51,123 --> 01:53:51,843
Lydia Fish.

1312
01:53:57,062 --> 01:54:00,505
just trying to close this one out.

1313
01:54:01,726 --> 01:54:04,608
We knew it would be a tough one for her because of the deadlift.

1314
01:54:09,692 --> 01:54:18,219
Miriam Van Wor is working through her final 50 feet across the competition floor.

1315
01:54:18,239 --> 01:54:23,483
Miriam Van Wor.

1316
01:54:24,528 --> 01:54:35,877
She's won the Open back-to-back years, 25 and 24, her first time on the competition floor here at the CrossFit Games.

1317
01:54:45,024 --> 01:54:45,865
Raptis is in.

1318
01:54:49,868 --> 01:54:50,709
Von Rohre is in.

1319
01:54:57,348 --> 01:55:01,131
Claudia Gluck still has 100 feet left to go.

1320
01:55:01,151 --> 01:55:07,818
As we are five minutes away from that 25 minute time cap.

1321
01:55:11,561 --> 01:55:12,823
Going on broken all the way back.

1322
01:55:27,543 --> 01:55:34,489
For some of these athletes, this is a big point of contention in regards to how they paced this thing, how they started this thing.

1323
01:55:36,050 --> 01:55:43,797
Again, we see a lot of athletes get off in round one around similar times, and then we see this parity towards the finish as Greer's across.

1324
01:55:44,637 --> 01:55:45,598
Annika Greer is in.

1325
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:48,521
Claudia Gluck.

1326
01:55:49,480 --> 01:55:51,861
Finish her final 50 feet.

1327
01:55:56,524 --> 01:56:04,149
Fisa Ghaffi won the event last night on the pegboard.

1328
01:56:06,410 --> 01:56:10,412
Just trying to do everything she can to finish this event to start day number two.

1329
01:56:14,094 --> 01:56:18,437
Fisa Ghaffi was sitting in ninth overall coming into this event.

1330
01:56:23,176 --> 01:56:25,177
Yeah, and struggling a bit, even with the handstand walk.

1331
01:56:25,217 --> 01:56:30,498
And of course, we understand there's been a tremendous accumulation throughout this event so far to get her to this fifth round.

1332
01:56:31,199 --> 01:56:40,081
But even the pace at which she's moving on her hands, that could have been a significant time loss throughout this whole event, where other athletes are simply just walking faster on their hands.

1333
01:56:41,122 --> 01:56:43,562
And what we have coming up, Adrienne, is this.

1334
01:56:46,277 --> 01:56:48,278
strength test of the games.

1335
01:56:48,378 --> 01:56:50,458
Obviously, strength has been tested in the clean.

1336
01:56:50,498 --> 01:56:52,039
It's being tested here in the deadlift.

1337
01:56:52,079 --> 01:56:58,421
But a one rep max back squat is what is looming for these individual athletes.

1338
01:56:58,541 --> 01:57:08,543
Now seeing this event take place, what is that fatigue element, that mental element coming in to that strength test for these athletes?

1339
01:57:08,783 --> 01:57:13,385
Well, along with yesterday, the three events that we worked through yesterday, and then this morning.

1340
01:57:14,266 --> 01:57:22,831
the distance that was covered in the run, and all these deadlifts is certainly going to accumulate and certainly affect what we see from a performance perspective on this back squat later.

1341
01:57:24,913 --> 01:57:32,697
Lucy Campbell will not be wearing pink and black much longer, and Tia will not be wearing white and red either.

1342
01:57:32,717 --> 01:57:40,062
A little wardrobe switcheroo going into the back squats later.

1343
01:57:49,094 --> 01:58:07,771
who won the in affiliate semifinal still I say still has plenty of time but sometimes when the athlete is like listen can we do about that 22 minute time cap that the guys have can we uh can we get that back

1344
01:58:13,605 --> 01:58:21,129
And ladies and gentlemen, strap in because it wasn't a single under that tripped her up.

1345
01:58:22,350 --> 01:58:28,993
Lucy Campbell has done what no one has been able to do in the middle of a competition.

1346
01:58:29,013 --> 01:58:31,615
See how we got there.

1347
01:58:31,635 --> 01:58:33,936
Check out these highlights presented by Rogue Fitness.

1348
01:58:35,536 --> 01:58:49,799
Chase, it was Tia, it was Amy Kringle, it was Haley Adams, but ultimately, it was the one who was able to compete with Miss Tia Claire Toomey, Lucy Campbell, that was the threat the entire time.

1349
01:58:50,140 --> 01:58:52,500
She was very consistent through rounds one and two.

1350
01:58:53,020 --> 01:58:59,722
And then what we started to notice is that Lucy would create an advantage for herself, coming off the deadlift, into the handstand walk.

1351
01:58:59,982 --> 01:59:02,203
Tia chose to broke and Lucy did not.

1352
01:59:02,423 --> 01:59:03,503
There was some efficiency

1353
01:59:04,303 --> 01:59:10,926
highlights that lead all the way from her deadlift with her narrow stance, slight softening of her upper back in order to increase her cycle rate.

1354
01:59:11,167 --> 01:59:15,649
These are all intentionally done by Lucy, but it was the handstand walk that really blew our minds.

1355
01:59:15,909 --> 01:59:17,570
Coming off of a wrist limitation.

1356
01:59:17,890 --> 01:59:22,512
How can you build the proficiency and capacity to have such a strong finish in an event like this?

1357
01:59:22,792 --> 01:59:25,534
And she put it on display here to start day two.

1358
01:59:25,594 --> 01:59:27,215
Lucy Campbell is your leader.

1359
01:59:27,915 --> 01:59:39,768
Lucy Campbell takes the event and takes the white leader jersey away from Tia Claire Toomey and dons it herself for the first time in her career.

1360
01:59:41,390 --> 01:59:43,473
She is down with Mike Arsenault.

1361
01:59:44,727 --> 01:59:47,749
Lucy, two years ago, you were told to pick a different sport.

1362
01:59:48,429 --> 01:59:52,011
Last year, you underwent another surgery on your wrist.

1363
01:59:52,972 --> 01:59:56,614
And later this afternoon, you're gonna be wearing the White Leaders jersey for the first time.

1364
01:59:57,335 --> 02:00:02,798
What has been the last two years like for you, this odyssey, mentally?

1365
02:00:03,817 --> 02:00:06,718
Um, it's been super tough, like, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it.

1366
02:00:06,798 --> 02:00:18,861
It's been, like, some of the lowest times of my life, just thinking about, you know, what I was gonna do with the rest of this if this didn't work out, and, you know, not just in sport and CrossFit, but in everything else that I love to do.

1367
02:00:18,881 --> 02:00:22,842
I used to journal a lot, and writing used to hurt my wrist and all that sort of stuff, so...

1368
02:00:24,101 --> 02:00:38,750
Um, it really threw a spanner in the works, um, but just, you know, trying to take it day by day and not focusing too far ahead, um, and just take the next step that I could and, you know, now I'm back and in a position that I've never been in before and that's pretty special.

1369
02:00:39,451 --> 02:00:42,373
Where does that, where does that perseverance come from?

1370
02:00:43,734 --> 02:00:44,554
I literally don't know, um,

1371
02:00:46,050 --> 02:00:52,974
I said on an Instagram story a couple of weeks ago that when you're in it, resilience feels a lot like vulnerability.

1372
02:00:53,394 --> 02:00:56,296
And I was crying more than I ever had done.

1373
02:00:56,316 --> 02:01:00,378
I was really trying to let myself feel all the emotions.

1374
02:01:00,418 --> 02:01:06,082
And I think there's a lot of narrative that to be mentally tough, you have to ignore all of this sort of hard feelings.

1375
02:01:06,822 --> 02:01:08,043
And actually, I think it's the opposite.

1376
02:01:08,063 --> 02:01:09,564
You just have to acknowledge it.

1377
02:01:09,704 --> 02:01:15,047
And I don't know where it came from, but it was just, as I say, take one step at a time.

1378
02:01:15,923 --> 02:01:18,425
Well, the mental strength, the mental focus is very impressive.

1379
02:01:18,785 --> 02:01:20,806
Physically, it looked like there were a few points yesterday.

1380
02:01:20,866 --> 02:01:23,048
We are still somewhat favoring the wrist a little bit.

1381
02:01:23,408 --> 02:01:29,031
Are there some movements that give you a little bit more pause now as opposed to before the operations?

1382
02:01:29,392 --> 02:01:30,412
Yeah, for sure.

1383
02:01:30,653 --> 02:01:32,174
Front rack continues to be a struggle.

1384
02:01:32,194 --> 02:01:33,975
We're very selective with when I do it.

1385
02:01:34,635 --> 02:01:39,697
So if that was shoulder to overhead that I was having to do yesterday, if there was any kind of jerk movement, then obviously we can't avoid it.

1386
02:01:39,777 --> 02:01:44,379
But I've now sort of added another tool to the toolbox in terms of the zombie clean.

1387
02:01:44,419 --> 02:01:52,341
And so being able to resort to that and lessen the pressure on my wrist for the events to come is really useful in terms of being back at this level.

1388
02:01:52,802 --> 02:01:53,982
Well, tremendous performance.

1389
02:01:54,022 --> 02:01:55,322
Your third career event win.

1390
02:01:55,643 --> 02:01:56,003
Well done.

1391
02:01:56,323 --> 02:01:56,663
Thank you.

1392
02:01:59,133 --> 02:02:00,995
Congratulations to Lucy Campbell.

1393
02:02:01,135 --> 02:02:05,800
Adrian, you have been an elite level in multiple sports throughout your career.

1394
02:02:05,940 --> 02:02:07,682
Coming back from injury is one thing.

1395
02:02:07,742 --> 02:02:11,205
How sweet it is to see that resilience pay off.

1396
02:02:11,666 --> 02:02:12,747
It's the best thing, Chase.

1397
02:02:12,767 --> 02:02:15,410
And what we're seeing here from Lucy Campbell is top notch.

1398
02:02:15,950 --> 02:02:16,971
human, right?

1399
02:02:17,031 --> 02:02:19,974
And I say that this goes far beyond her as an athlete.

1400
02:02:20,214 --> 02:02:25,078
This is her as a human, her vulnerability, her willingness to share what the struggle is like, even with us in that moment.

1401
02:02:25,358 --> 02:02:32,765
But it's her being connected to what she's experiencing and now persevering through the hard work, the zombie cleans, the adjustments that she's got to make in all these events.

1402
02:02:33,385 --> 02:02:34,246
And she's doing it today.

1403
02:02:34,266 --> 02:02:35,248
It's been very impressive.

1404
02:02:35,268 --> 02:02:38,652
Well, Lucy Campbell will be in red and white and she has a new challenge.

1405
02:02:38,772 --> 02:02:41,055
Can she keep it for another event?

1406
02:02:41,255 --> 02:02:44,219
Teams are next here at the 2025 CrossFit Games.

1407
02:03:08,891 --> 02:03:15,835
to you by Rogue, Don't Weaken, the official equipment supplier of CrossFit and the CrossFit Games.

1408
02:03:16,776 --> 02:03:21,639
Belites, we are Belites and we are made, not born.

1409
02:03:22,660 --> 02:03:26,362
The United States Border Patrol, the an agent of strength.

1410
02:03:27,683 --> 02:03:32,546
And Sotva, unlock the superpower of restorative sleep.

1411
02:03:43,173 --> 02:03:48,216
I became the owner of CrossFit Spur after being introduced to CrossFit in probably 2010, 2011.

1412
02:03:48,397 --> 02:03:53,400
Coached at a local box for a bit.

1413
02:03:53,800 --> 02:03:55,441
Really enjoyed it more than I thought I would.

1414
02:03:56,222 --> 02:04:01,025
Ended up getting my L1 and decided that I'd like to go off of my own and give it a shot.

1415
02:04:01,525 --> 02:04:02,125
Way better.

1416
02:04:02,345 --> 02:04:02,505
Good.

1417
02:04:02,545 --> 02:04:05,126
We're just outside of Albany, a small town called Glenmont.

1418
02:04:06,146 --> 02:04:11,008
I worked in the town that Crossfittsburg is in for many, many years.

1419
02:04:11,448 --> 02:04:12,288
It's a neighboring town.

1420
02:04:12,728 --> 02:04:14,349
Got to know the community really well.

1421
02:04:14,969 --> 02:04:25,292
But after kind of being here and growing through word of mouth, organic growth, and people starting to understand that what we do is make people healthy, we sort of earned a reputation of making people better.

1422
02:04:26,572 --> 02:04:27,792
anything no matter what they wanted to do.

1423
02:04:28,812 --> 02:04:32,493
John and Lauren will do just about anything to help anybody get better at anything.

1424
02:04:32,853 --> 02:04:34,314
I'm convinced of that for sure.

1425
02:04:34,454 --> 02:04:36,494
You have an AMRAP for 14 minutes.

1426
02:04:36,534 --> 02:04:41,675
My wife Lauren has been a member at the gym for longer than she was an employee here.

1427
02:04:41,975 --> 02:04:50,757
She's an organizer for sure so she does a great job keeping everything in line, taking care of the boring stuff that people don't quite understand all the ins and outs of business ownership.

1428
02:04:51,577 --> 02:04:54,720
I don't know that the gym would be able to run without her.

1429
02:04:54,760 --> 02:04:57,502
It certainly would not have been able to expand the way it did without her.

1430
02:05:01,806 --> 02:05:05,690
We are probably the largest in the Capital District, definitely one of the largest.

1431
02:05:06,050 --> 02:05:09,493
We've got 6,500 plus square feet of floor space.

1432
02:05:10,114 --> 02:05:16,579
We've got two rigs, full corral of bikes and rowers and all the endurance machines you could possibly want.

1433
02:05:17,400 --> 02:05:21,062
COVID hit, the reality set in that we might not be opening for quite a while.

1434
02:05:21,082 --> 02:05:23,883
We ended up creating sort of a fitness library.

1435
02:05:23,923 --> 02:05:25,464
We labeled all of our equipment.

1436
02:05:25,744 --> 02:05:29,666
And we allowed our members to come in twice a week and swap out their equipment.

1437
02:05:29,906 --> 02:05:31,447
So they each got to take two pieces home.

1438
02:05:31,927 --> 02:05:33,628
But through that, we didn't lose a single member.

1439
02:05:34,608 --> 02:05:41,531
In addition to the CrossFit space, we have some offices next door where we've got a therapy room with contrast therapy.

1440
02:05:41,572 --> 02:05:42,352
We have a cold plunge.

1441
02:05:42,432 --> 02:05:43,352
We have a sauna.

1442
02:05:43,873 --> 02:05:45,413
We've also got a barber shop.

1443
02:05:45,634 --> 02:05:48,875
We have two massage therapists that are here full time.

1444
02:05:49,075 --> 02:05:50,336
We've also got a chiropractor.

1445
02:05:50,776 --> 02:05:54,418
We've got a little bit of everything to offer for anyone looking to get healthy.

1446
02:05:56,715 --> 02:05:59,559
I've been a member here at CrossFit Spur for 10 years.

1447
02:06:00,400 --> 02:06:03,064
It's just grown and grown and grown, this business.

1448
02:06:03,485 --> 02:06:05,708
Doubled, almost tripled the size of it.

1449
02:06:06,048 --> 02:06:10,034
So many new members, so many members that have been here for quite a long time, as long as me.

1450
02:06:10,615 --> 02:06:11,296
So it's really great.

1451
02:06:12,217 --> 02:06:17,381
I moved here during grad school, and honestly, if it wasn't for this community here, I probably still wouldn't live here.

1452
02:06:17,681 --> 02:06:19,782
John and Lauren have created such a great atmosphere.

1453
02:06:20,103 --> 02:06:21,504
Everybody here is like-minded.

1454
02:06:21,744 --> 02:06:22,845
Everybody supports each other.

1455
02:06:22,865 --> 02:06:26,047
His programming is fantastic.

1456
02:06:26,487 --> 02:06:31,691
And what's really impressive, when the people don't know this, they don't realize what goes into the coaching aspect.

1457
02:06:31,991 --> 02:06:37,014
They don't see the notes that I see from him saying, this is what I want you to focus on today.

1458
02:06:37,074 --> 02:06:38,035
Make sure they do this.

1459
02:06:38,155 --> 02:06:38,956
Don't let them do this.

1460
02:06:39,596 --> 02:06:40,577
I want you to check this.

1461
02:06:40,997 --> 02:06:42,318
He's not throwing stuff together.

1462
02:06:42,338 --> 02:06:43,558
It gives you a different perspective.

1463
02:06:43,818 --> 02:06:45,499
It's not just a place they go work out.

1464
02:06:45,860 --> 02:06:46,940
This is where their friends are.

1465
02:06:47,360 --> 02:06:48,901
This is where they enjoy spending time.

1466
02:06:49,802 --> 02:06:56,125
It makes going to the gym something that they want to do, which I think is part of the reason that we've grown the way we have.

1467
02:06:56,145 --> 02:06:57,606
It's their place.

1468
02:07:09,869 --> 02:07:12,572
What's the key component when we look at functional movements?

1469
02:07:12,612 --> 02:07:13,392
What are we looking for?

1470
02:07:13,412 --> 02:07:16,195
The ability to move a large load.

1471
02:07:16,475 --> 02:07:17,516
Long distances.

1472
02:07:17,736 --> 02:07:18,037
Quickly.

1473
02:07:18,277 --> 02:07:18,917
Ready and go.

1474
02:07:19,017 --> 02:07:19,738
And now reach up.

1475
02:07:19,858 --> 02:07:26,064
Mastering the nine foundational movements is key to building strong, efficient CrossFit skills.

1476
02:07:26,144 --> 02:07:28,966
The squat, front squat, and the overhead squat.

1477
02:07:29,086 --> 02:07:34,611
The press, push press, push jerk, deadlift, sumo deadlift, high pull, and the med ball clean.

1478
02:07:34,811 --> 02:07:41,356
We can basically break down all of our human and athletic movement to a foundation of these movements.

1479
02:07:41,736 --> 02:07:44,759
And stand, missy, send your hip back a little bit more, delay your knee.

1480
02:07:44,899 --> 02:07:51,724
These movements teach essential themes like core stability, posterior chain engagement, and full range of motion across the joints.

1481
02:07:52,605 --> 02:07:55,408
Skills that transfer to many other functional movements.

1482
02:07:56,109 --> 02:08:02,395
Get these right, and you'll have the foundation to confidently move, lift, and thrive.

1483
02:13:23,033 --> 02:13:23,093
So,

1484
02:22:04,457 --> 02:22:11,704
Today's coverage at MVP Arena in Albany, New York of the 2025 CrossFit Games is presented by Veletas.

1485
02:22:12,125 --> 02:22:15,628
We are Veletas, and we are made not born.

1486
02:22:16,589 --> 02:22:25,058
Welcome back inside this year's Coliseum alongside the seven times CrossFit Games athlete Bethany Flores, Bella Martin down on the floor.

1487
02:22:25,118 --> 02:22:26,439
My name is Joel Godet.

1488
02:22:26,459 --> 02:22:27,380
The rest of our crew,

1489
02:22:27,981 --> 02:22:30,963
Glad to have you with us for team competition.

1490
02:22:31,503 --> 02:22:40,908
And if you thought that Campbell City CrossFit was going to be in first place after four events, you go to Campbell City CrossFit in Winston-Salem, North Carolina.

1491
02:22:41,529 --> 02:22:43,990
They were shocked when we spoke to them this morning.

1492
02:22:44,010 --> 02:22:46,271
A phenomenal first day.

1493
02:22:47,452 --> 02:22:56,317
Q21 is in 11th place, trying to crack their way up into our second heat based on their performance in our first event today.

1494
02:22:56,937 --> 02:23:02,959
All right, team event number five, it is up over and back brought to us by the United States Border Patrol.

1495
02:23:02,999 --> 02:23:04,539
And Bethany, this is a grinder.

1496
02:23:04,939 --> 02:23:07,020
This is we have six total rounds.

1497
02:23:07,140 --> 02:23:08,741
It'll be a 20 minute time cap.

1498
02:23:08,941 --> 02:23:22,565
The first three rounds are 40 chest of our alternating pairs every 10 reps with 10 worm over and back into three rounds of 28 bar muscle ups, alternating pairs every seven reps, seven worm over back on the shoulder.

1499
02:23:25,228 --> 02:23:31,154
United States Border Patrol be an agent of strength Bella Martin's pretty strong.

1500
02:23:31,174 --> 02:23:31,894
What do you got for us?

1501
02:23:32,435 --> 02:23:42,364
Well, I'll tell you what guys this is the first event of the weekend for the teams that requires pure teamwork and Communication those teams that can communicate on the rig for the bar muscle ups in the chest bar.

1502
02:23:42,725 --> 02:23:47,910
It's quick sets It'll be pretty important and have no no reps there but it's going to be on that worm and

1503
02:23:48,110 --> 02:23:57,060
where the teams that have trained together, the teams that have good communications and probably fewer big personalities are going to be proven successful here on this kind of moderately longer test.

1504
02:23:57,341 --> 02:23:58,622
We'll see if the team can go no reps.

1505
02:23:59,023 --> 02:24:00,324
Every single one counts.

1506
02:24:00,444 --> 02:24:04,910
So you're going to want to make sure you're communicating clearly and moving as quickly as you can, guys.

1507
02:24:06,652 --> 02:24:07,493
Bella, thank you.

1508
02:24:07,653 --> 02:24:12,096
Cued 21 in 11th place as the highest seeded team in this first heat.

1509
02:24:12,697 --> 02:24:14,438
It'll be in the middle of the floor on lane five.

1510
02:24:14,798 --> 02:24:24,325
CrossFit 1124 in lane six, overcoming a last place finish in the first event with a first place finish in event number four.

1511
02:24:24,786 --> 02:24:27,728
To get themselves back into contention, they are in lane six.

1512
02:24:29,489 --> 02:24:34,391
Speaking of 1124, they are one of our Vision Fuels Victory athletes to watch.

1513
02:24:34,451 --> 02:24:38,852
The group from Marietta, Georgia, a second year team at the CrossFit Games.

1514
02:24:38,892 --> 02:24:45,375
They added Jessica Androsik, 161 in the middle of your screen, a mayhem athlete looking to make some big strides.

1515
02:24:45,435 --> 02:24:53,797
And then Q21, they are looking to be the best Latin American team to ever compete at the CrossFit Games.

1516
02:24:53,817 --> 02:24:54,878
17 is the number to beat.

1517
02:24:54,898 --> 02:24:56,738
That was Big Friends back in 2017.

1518
02:25:03,030 --> 02:25:06,692
And away we go with pairs to the chest-to-bar pull-ups.

1519
02:25:07,193 --> 02:25:10,535
You don't have to specify which gender goes first here.

1520
02:25:10,555 --> 02:25:18,860
It can be either your males or your females, but you must complete 10 repetitions of chest-to-bar pull-ups before you switch to your second pair.

1521
02:25:19,600 --> 02:25:21,021
A lot of pulling yesterday, Bethany.

1522
02:25:21,181 --> 02:25:22,622
How do your pulling muscles feel?

1523
02:25:23,558 --> 02:25:30,584
I hope OK with some of these athletes, but you might be a little sore with some of these, especially the bar muscle ups when they get to the three rounds of bar muscle ups.

1524
02:25:30,804 --> 02:25:35,567
I foresee that being a little bit of some trouble for some of the athletes, especially having to hold at the top.

1525
02:25:35,728 --> 02:25:38,430
Those triceps are going to be little spicy.

1526
02:25:39,415 --> 02:25:40,596
40 total repetitions here.

1527
02:25:41,136 --> 02:25:45,959
We were talking to Butcher's Lab team in second place overall just before this event began.

1528
02:25:45,999 --> 02:25:48,981
And Pernilla Christensen said, I feel really good about my pulling.

1529
02:25:49,021 --> 02:25:55,465
And Thomas Stroyer looked at us and said, no, biceps are a little taxed from the pegboard climbs yesterday.

1530
02:25:55,485 --> 02:25:55,725
Yeah.

1531
02:25:56,065 --> 02:25:57,946
I think a lot of the athletes, though, it's the lower body.

1532
02:25:58,307 --> 02:26:02,949
They said they're pretty sore with the hamstrings and the lower body just from a lot of running they did yesterday.

1533
02:26:02,969 --> 02:26:03,870
A lot of running.

1534
02:26:05,334 --> 02:26:07,795
two sets of ten for each of these athletes.

1535
02:26:07,855 --> 02:26:12,777
That gets you to 40 total and then on to the worm clean up and overs.

1536
02:26:12,977 --> 02:26:18,639
And this is all about teamwork, Bethany, specifically because of the return to the initial shoulder.

1537
02:26:19,139 --> 02:26:24,581
Yeah, one one misstep and man, that's a long, costly no rep.

1538
02:26:25,021 --> 02:26:26,281
And you have to start from the ground.

1539
02:26:26,461 --> 02:26:30,983
You have to start the whole rep over if you get some type of mishap or no rep.

1540
02:26:31,463 --> 02:26:33,284
And that's not fun, especially with these.

1541
02:26:33,724 --> 02:26:34,524
This is a new movement to.

1542
02:26:35,388 --> 02:26:38,075
All the athletes haven't done this in competition before.

1543
02:26:38,516 --> 02:26:40,542
Maybe some of them have done it in practice, but.

1544
02:26:42,166 --> 02:26:45,527
It's gonna be interesting to see how the communication goes with this movement.

1545
02:26:45,667 --> 02:26:46,927
That's the tricky piece to it.

1546
02:26:47,047 --> 02:26:50,208
Typically we've seen worm clean and jerks in competition.

1547
02:26:50,228 --> 02:26:55,149
So you're picking the worm up from the ground to one shoulder, over your head to the other, and then you put it down.

1548
02:26:55,489 --> 02:26:58,890
But it's one more step bringing it back to that initial shoulder.

1549
02:26:59,350 --> 02:27:03,751
And that's where we see some miscommunication steps come through.

1550
02:27:04,112 --> 02:27:06,192
Not the case for Undivided right there.

1551
02:27:06,212 --> 02:27:07,112
Pretty clean rep.

1552
02:27:08,273 --> 02:27:09,673
I will say body blueprint.

1553
02:27:10,812 --> 02:27:15,474
We spoke to them in the warm-up area, and they said they've really not touched the worm together.

1554
02:27:15,494 --> 02:27:17,135
No, no, not touched the worm together.

1555
02:27:17,155 --> 02:27:18,695
This is the first time.

1556
02:27:18,715 --> 02:27:19,135
Oh, no.

1557
02:27:19,275 --> 02:27:22,197
Well, yesterday, the worm was in the game.

1558
02:27:22,377 --> 02:27:23,897
And there's no worm in the warm-up area.

1559
02:27:24,157 --> 02:27:24,338
No.

1560
02:27:24,978 --> 02:27:27,319
Which, to me, sounds a little scary.

1561
02:27:27,839 --> 02:27:29,860
That would be a scary thought.

1562
02:27:31,039 --> 02:27:33,100
To some degree, rewards preparation.

1563
02:27:33,480 --> 02:27:37,882
You know you're going to see the ultimate implement of team testing at the CrossFit Games.

1564
02:27:37,942 --> 02:27:41,863
Those teams that have gotten on to a worm, going to have that advantage.

1565
02:27:42,924 --> 02:27:49,827
Greater Heights, veteran group, right now in your lead, tied with Prostanda going back and forth, also a veteran group out of Sweden.

1566
02:27:50,846 --> 02:27:52,707
And there is Greater Heights Overtake.

1567
02:27:53,527 --> 02:28:04,510
It's a team made up of pieces from last year's Einhorn CrossFit team, last year's Overtake team, and now competing out of CrossFit Greater Heights, which has previously sent teams to the games.

1568
02:28:06,370 --> 02:28:08,531
They're all Texans, if you just, we'll simplify it.

1569
02:28:08,791 --> 02:28:11,152
Yes, and they want to be one of the best Texas teams.

1570
02:28:12,132 --> 02:28:17,634
Don't Stop has that record, 2019, finishing sixth overall, qualifying out of Texas.

1571
02:28:18,194 --> 02:28:18,874
They got some work to do.

1572
02:28:20,753 --> 02:28:23,054
need to make their way into the second heat first and foremost.

1573
02:28:23,134 --> 02:28:23,454
Yes.

1574
02:28:24,694 --> 02:28:31,115
So I can see, foresee, you know, even though, I mean, those Chester bars are going to add up very quickly.

1575
02:28:31,795 --> 02:28:38,877
So doing that, plus trying to communicate on the worm, that's going to add up on the upper body very fast.

1576
02:28:39,257 --> 02:28:44,578
So we're going to see how they do once they get into rounds three, four, five, six.

1577
02:28:51,979 --> 02:28:54,781
347 into a 20 minute time cap.

1578
02:28:54,841 --> 02:29:01,526
This is the second of three times to the worm and you're taking a look at the Long Island team from CrossFit Undivided.

1579
02:29:02,287 --> 02:29:11,934
Christine Best, Griffin Raleigh, Christine Zanosko, one of the strongest women in CrossFit, and Mike Needleman, who's previously competed on a team for training Think Tank.

1580
02:29:11,954 --> 02:29:14,195
That's a veteran group, struggled so far though.

1581
02:29:14,536 --> 02:29:17,878
17th, 11th, 16th, and 16th with some work to do today.

1582
02:29:21,287 --> 02:29:28,969
When you, Bethany, having competed at the Games, maybe have a day that you didn't expect or see coming, what's your mentality when you start the next one?

1583
02:29:29,390 --> 02:29:30,770
It's just next day mentality.

1584
02:29:30,790 --> 02:29:32,230
You just have to reset.

1585
02:29:32,250 --> 02:29:36,472
You have to let go of whatever happened in the past, whether it was good or bad.

1586
02:29:36,492 --> 02:29:43,014
Because if you hold on to good things, too, it can also cause some mental mistakes because you just get really excited, but especially when it's bad.

1587
02:29:44,301 --> 02:29:44,821
Got to let it go.

1588
02:29:44,941 --> 02:29:46,122
Do you change your strategy?

1589
02:29:46,142 --> 02:29:48,783
Do you say, all right, we're not where we wanted to be.

1590
02:29:48,944 --> 02:29:53,566
We need to try to take some shots and maybe be a little uncomfortable.

1591
02:29:53,586 --> 02:29:54,307
Depends on the workout.

1592
02:29:54,547 --> 02:29:57,388
It depends on your strengths as a team and as athletes.

1593
02:29:57,608 --> 02:30:08,835
If you feel like you can make some moves, especially if you know that you've done the worm over and over again, and you're like, I am so confident, even though we've not done this movement in competition, this is the time to make a move.

1594
02:30:10,155 --> 02:30:11,016
Got to make some risks.

1595
02:30:12,209 --> 02:30:15,711
Greater heights took a 20th in event four yesterday.

1596
02:30:15,731 --> 02:30:17,572
They are the first team back to the rig.

1597
02:30:17,612 --> 02:30:21,073
Here comes UNESCO and that crew from undivided.

1598
02:30:25,055 --> 02:30:26,616
Greater heights on the right side of your screen.

1599
02:30:26,816 --> 02:30:27,876
Undivided on the left.

1600
02:30:28,897 --> 02:30:32,639
Sierra Cole, athlete closest to you on the right side.

1601
02:30:32,659 --> 02:30:35,540
Working with Sidney Waltz, the former Kentucky gymnast.

1602
02:30:36,830 --> 02:30:41,612
I think a good note, too, is every round, they can decide which pair goes first.

1603
02:30:41,992 --> 02:30:46,494
So if the males are like, hey, I'm toasted, y'all get up there, females.

1604
02:30:46,634 --> 02:30:48,315
Or same thing, vice versa, with the females.

1605
02:30:48,335 --> 02:30:49,455
They're like, I'm not going.

1606
02:30:49,475 --> 02:30:49,975
I'm not ready.

1607
02:30:50,355 --> 02:30:51,236
The males can go first.

1608
02:30:51,516 --> 02:30:52,116
So that's kind of nice.

1609
02:30:53,097 --> 02:30:54,917
Looking for synchronized chest to bar.

1610
02:30:58,740 --> 02:31:04,163
And it's actually kind of nice that you're looking at your partner here, as opposed to being next to your partner and having to look over.

1611
02:31:04,663 --> 02:31:05,064
Correct.

1612
02:31:05,184 --> 02:31:11,007
And then, like, if you're on one bar next to each other, you're having to go a little bit more narrow, which is not fun.

1613
02:31:11,667 --> 02:31:14,089
So I like this setup a lot more.

1614
02:31:14,129 --> 02:31:21,633
It's pleasing to the eye, I think, for the fans and people watching on camera, but also probably nice for the athletes.

1615
02:31:26,913 --> 02:31:48,418
Undivided making their way back up to the worm they surpass greater heights, but just by a couple of seconds here There is something soothing right like this is this is CrossFit ASMR Just watching lots of people in synchronicity doing Chester bar We hope we want that to happen for them

1616
02:31:51,275 --> 02:31:56,938
This is the final round for the athletes that are making their way to the worm of the chest-to-bar.

1617
02:31:57,018 --> 02:32:01,461
Next time they return to the rig, the movement changes and the rep scheme changes.

1618
02:32:01,801 --> 02:32:06,104
It will be sets of seven bar muscle-ups in synchronization.

1619
02:32:06,675 --> 02:32:22,213
And that's where I'm intrigued to see how their upper body holds up, because with synchro bar muscle-ups, they have to hold at the top, and that extra squeeze and hold at the top, even if it's just one more second, that's gonna add up on the triceps and the upper body, and we'll see what it does to the worm.

1620
02:32:23,992 --> 02:32:26,853
That worm implement weighs 365 pounds.

1621
02:32:27,773 --> 02:32:32,295
The main sandbags weigh 100 pounds for the men, 70 pounds for the women.

1622
02:32:33,195 --> 02:32:37,537
So you'll always have a male competitor in the front and a female competitor in the back.

1623
02:32:39,278 --> 02:32:41,759
And then the gaps in the middle are 15 pounds, are they seven?

1624
02:32:41,779 --> 02:32:42,879
Do you know that?

1625
02:32:42,919 --> 02:32:44,620
The skin itself is seven pounds.

1626
02:32:45,860 --> 02:32:48,581
And then the spacers are six pounds.

1627
02:32:49,441 --> 02:32:50,722
That adds up, that's a lot of weight.

1628
02:32:53,027 --> 02:32:54,528
Not every gym has one of these.

1629
02:32:55,909 --> 02:32:57,030
No, they're probably really expensive.

1630
02:32:59,692 --> 02:33:02,134
Yet affordable, if you would like to own one at your home.

1631
02:33:02,214 --> 02:33:02,935
That's true.

1632
02:33:04,236 --> 02:33:05,277
Here comes Greater Heights.

1633
02:33:06,057 --> 02:33:12,743
Remember, they were first back to the rig after the last round, but Undivided was first off the rig.

1634
02:33:13,143 --> 02:33:15,705
So Greater Heights is making up ground on the worm.

1635
02:33:16,045 --> 02:33:20,329
And keep that in the back of your mind, because this test ends on the worm.

1636
02:33:24,346 --> 02:33:26,427
11.24 has surpassed undivided.

1637
02:33:26,487 --> 02:33:27,647
They've moved into second.

1638
02:33:29,608 --> 02:33:32,629
Jessica Androsik across from you, working with Sydney Smith.

1639
02:33:36,730 --> 02:33:38,850
I like seeing the different techniques in the bar muscle ups.

1640
02:33:40,031 --> 02:33:46,132
I think a lot of the gymnasts do more of like a tipping motion where the feet come maybe a little bit higher, obviously not above the bar.

1641
02:33:46,993 --> 02:33:51,574
And then we have another one where it's just like a huge arch at the bottom and then coming up.

1642
02:33:53,045 --> 02:33:54,987
sets of seven before you can trade out.

1643
02:33:55,047 --> 02:33:58,630
You can take breaks, but you can't change pairs until you complete seven.

1644
02:33:58,650 --> 02:34:04,935
I feel like bar muscle ups are one of those movements for the layman in CrossFit that you have on your bucket list.

1645
02:34:05,395 --> 02:34:05,875
Absolutely.

1646
02:34:05,996 --> 02:34:07,857
Bethany, how do you get one done if you've never done it before?

1647
02:34:08,498 --> 02:34:08,938
Oh, man.

1648
02:34:09,618 --> 02:34:14,342
I feel like with gymnastics movements, it's all about repetitions and just doing it over and over again.

1649
02:34:15,737 --> 02:34:17,299
And finally, it just clicks.

1650
02:34:17,439 --> 02:34:20,342
There's going to be one day where a lot of people, that's why you see it during the open.

1651
02:34:20,382 --> 02:34:22,405
Everyone's like, oh my gosh, I got it.

1652
02:34:23,446 --> 02:34:25,548
It just takes numbers, numbers, numbers, numbers.

1653
02:34:25,768 --> 02:34:27,951
That's how it is with all gymnastics movements.

1654
02:34:28,111 --> 02:34:30,233
It's a very frustrating thing, let me tell you.

1655
02:34:30,674 --> 02:34:34,418
But once you get it, it's probably one of the happiest moments that you can get across it.

1656
02:34:37,298 --> 02:34:39,260
This is a comfort spot for both of these teams.

1657
02:34:39,340 --> 02:34:43,764
Sydney Waltz, a gymnast all around at the NCAA Championships for Kentucky.

1658
02:34:44,605 --> 02:34:48,769
Jessica Androsik, a gymnast, her favorite event, bars.

1659
02:34:49,810 --> 02:34:50,510
That's a little bit different.

1660
02:34:50,531 --> 02:34:54,234
This is like a high bar versus the parallel bars, or the uneven bars, I should say.

1661
02:34:54,254 --> 02:34:57,177
But looks to her advantage, for sure.

1662
02:35:00,261 --> 02:35:06,803
It is greater heights that makes their way to the worm and it is again 10 more worm over and backs and look at the synchronicity there.

1663
02:35:07,244 --> 02:35:09,384
The call to just drop down and pick it up.

1664
02:35:09,504 --> 02:35:09,825
Wow.

1665
02:35:10,365 --> 02:35:11,045
Perfection.

1666
02:35:11,065 --> 02:35:11,925
It's beautiful.

1667
02:35:11,945 --> 02:35:18,588
That's a team that's probably worked on the worm a couple times at home.

1668
02:35:19,128 --> 02:35:24,710
Poetry in motion for greater heights and 11.24, just a couple of reps behind.

1669
02:35:27,298 --> 02:35:34,521
And can confirm with 1124, Timon and Pumbaa, the matching tattoos on the guys, it's on the quad.

1670
02:35:35,241 --> 02:35:36,081
So can confirm.

1671
02:35:39,322 --> 02:35:41,343
It's very important information, if you didn't know.

1672
02:35:42,043 --> 02:35:44,044
People wanna know the information about that.

1673
02:35:44,184 --> 02:35:46,705
Riley Good and Tyler Cook, lifelong friends.

1674
02:35:47,865 --> 02:35:49,246
Well, they've been friends for a long time.

1675
02:35:49,306 --> 02:35:52,827
All right, the worm is being advanced for greater heights.

1676
02:35:54,365 --> 02:35:59,127
And they have two more rounds of bar muscle-ups and worm work.

1677
02:35:59,727 --> 02:36:01,088
Right behind them though is 11.24.

1678
02:36:02,288 --> 02:36:05,790
Undivided has fallen five reps off the pace.

1679
02:36:10,632 --> 02:36:13,113
And also a good note is they have to get

1680
02:36:13,750 --> 02:36:19,353
every team member across that huge yellow line before they start doing their gymnastics movements.

1681
02:36:19,433 --> 02:36:22,475
So, if not everyone's across, they cannot start their movements.

1682
02:36:22,515 --> 02:36:24,036
It's almost a good time by.

1683
02:36:24,456 --> 02:36:27,197
Like, it does slow you down, but it also lets you shake everything out.

1684
02:36:27,457 --> 02:36:35,522
Gives you a little breather for a second, which is probably much needed in this long, grinding, spaghetti mess of a workout.

1685
02:36:35,882 --> 02:36:37,803
It's so pleasing to the eye, though, at the same time.

1686
02:36:38,403 --> 02:36:39,324
Let's check in with Bella Martin.

1687
02:36:41,640 --> 02:36:44,401
Joel, we're down here on the floor watching 1124.

1688
02:36:44,461 --> 02:36:46,162
We caught up with Sydney this morning.

1689
02:36:46,182 --> 02:36:51,524
She was telling us how important it is specifically for them to communicate well on this workout.

1690
02:36:51,564 --> 02:36:57,886
We saw them at semifinals for the individuals back in June and communication was a huge problem for them.

1691
02:36:58,226 --> 02:37:04,609
So we were not expecting this team to be able to hold on to almost take a heat win here this far into the workout.

1692
02:37:04,889 --> 02:37:09,971
You can tell Sydney's talking to her team, keeping the boys calm and it's actually paying off for this team.

1693
02:37:10,231 --> 02:37:10,811
And they were pretty,

1694
02:37:11,171 --> 02:37:13,513
pretty confused and a little bit concerned about this one.

1695
02:37:14,354 --> 02:37:15,015
Bella, thank you.

1696
02:37:15,075 --> 02:37:22,442
And because semifinals were online for teams this year, a lot of these teams haven't competed as a foursome in person.

1697
02:37:22,462 --> 02:37:23,803
1124 did.

1698
02:37:24,124 --> 02:37:26,806
They had that experience going to syndicate crown.

1699
02:37:27,186 --> 02:37:28,308
Semifinal had teams.

1700
02:37:28,368 --> 02:37:29,909
There were no tickets at stake, though.

1701
02:37:30,490 --> 02:37:31,851
You get to work out some of those things.

1702
02:37:32,411 --> 02:37:35,835
Yeah, I think it's definitely an advantage to have that in-person competition.

1703
02:37:37,023 --> 02:37:41,045
If you don't, you just, you can't replicate that in training.

1704
02:37:41,165 --> 02:37:45,928
It just, you just can't, especially like when it comes to intensity and things going wrong.

1705
02:37:47,228 --> 02:37:52,211
It's a beautiful thing to have that mess up or that hiccup in in-person competitions.

1706
02:37:52,331 --> 02:37:54,892
And Bethany Flores, things will go wrong, will they not?

1707
02:37:55,552 --> 02:37:57,113
Oh yes, they will absolutely go wrong.

1708
02:37:58,214 --> 02:38:01,675
If they don't, you're doing something wrong.

1709
02:38:01,715 --> 02:38:04,917
Greater heights in 11.24, neck and neck as they head to the worm.

1710
02:38:07,208 --> 02:38:08,809
seven minutes until the cap.

1711
02:38:08,829 --> 02:38:17,911
10 more worm clean up and overs, followed by one more round of bar muscle ups and one more set at the worm.

1712
02:38:21,032 --> 02:38:24,693
Honestly, the struggle part has seemed not that strugglesome for some of these teams.

1713
02:38:24,733 --> 02:38:26,094
The second over.

1714
02:38:27,300 --> 02:38:28,220
I'm very surprised.

1715
02:38:28,721 --> 02:38:36,283
I know there was a team that tried this out at the ranch, and their time was 20.05, so right over the time cap.

1716
02:38:36,743 --> 02:38:39,804
But I think we're expecting to see a lot of teams hopefully finish this workout.

1717
02:38:41,645 --> 02:38:42,625
I'm sorry, I stay corrected.

1718
02:38:42,685 --> 02:38:45,726
Seven up and overs once you get to the bar muscle-ups.

1719
02:38:46,067 --> 02:38:46,827
Ten on the first round.

1720
02:38:50,473 --> 02:38:58,517
And the final rep for greater heights they will advance and the hand is in the air for casey strong Do not put that thing down early.

1721
02:38:58,537 --> 02:39:15,085
That's good team communication They are neck and neck And there are only two teams that are on their final round of bar muscle-ups

1722
02:39:15,995 --> 02:39:22,102
Hendersonville and undivided are heading down to the worm for their penultimate work on that implement.

1723
02:39:22,843 --> 02:39:24,866
But this is where your race is.

1724
02:39:29,291 --> 02:39:32,074
CrossFit Hendersonville is in third place, right side of your screen.

1725
02:39:32,114 --> 02:39:34,117
Dalton Rogers in front.

1726
02:39:41,122 --> 02:39:46,326
And you can see just a little bit of the fatigue here, Bethany, that extra push in the dip out of the bar muscle-up.

1727
02:39:46,586 --> 02:39:48,047
They add up very quickly.

1728
02:39:48,808 --> 02:39:50,089
And once they go, they go.

1729
02:39:50,489 --> 02:39:53,732
So if you need to break, break them up.

1730
02:39:53,812 --> 02:39:56,574
But you don't want to start failing on bar muscle-ups.

1731
02:39:57,895 --> 02:40:02,498
This is 102 upper body pulls in this event.

1732
02:40:02,559 --> 02:40:05,080
And there's a no rep for Casey Strong on the right side.

1733
02:40:06,542 --> 02:40:08,023
How often are you training that kind of volume?

1734
02:40:09,514 --> 02:40:10,695
Hopefully a good amount.

1735
02:40:11,675 --> 02:40:17,359
You want to hit that, because if you don't, then when you get to a competition, it's going to be a nice slap in the face.

1736
02:40:18,420 --> 02:40:22,222
But that's also showing you that they're leaving everything on the line.

1737
02:40:22,302 --> 02:40:24,683
They're coming here, and they're going to try.

1738
02:40:26,224 --> 02:40:27,045
They're putting everything out.

1739
02:40:27,585 --> 02:40:29,626
And I love to see it.

1740
02:40:29,746 --> 02:40:30,347
I love to see it.

1741
02:40:33,168 --> 02:40:34,889
Looking to set the time to beat here for 11.24.

1742
02:40:35,290 --> 02:40:41,414
They are 25 points out of right now, the second heat.

1743
02:40:42,775 --> 02:40:44,436
You can't get to the podium from heat one.

1744
02:40:45,377 --> 02:40:49,040
Long way to go, but 11.24 needs Riley good to go.

1745
02:40:49,720 --> 02:40:51,261
Tyler Cook is saying, get up.

1746
02:40:51,602 --> 02:40:52,442
We're in Albany.

1747
02:40:55,104 --> 02:41:00,628
Yeah, we got, we had a little bit of some yelling out there, but we got some passion on the floor, passion on the floor.

1748
02:41:00,728 --> 02:41:01,389
And there goes 11.24.

1749
02:41:06,020 --> 02:41:08,182
Tyler Cook pointing up to the crowd.

1750
02:41:11,024 --> 02:41:12,865
Overtake has hit a snag.

1751
02:41:12,885 --> 02:41:18,849
And 11.24 is all alone here at the front of Heat One.

1752
02:41:19,670 --> 02:41:20,991
Seven more reps.

1753
02:41:21,251 --> 02:41:23,032
Comes greater heights, right behind.

1754
02:41:23,052 --> 02:41:27,395
This is where it's gonna be costly.

1755
02:41:27,415 --> 02:41:28,196
You have a no rep.

1756
02:41:29,922 --> 02:41:30,823
It could be do or die.

1757
02:41:31,203 --> 02:41:34,165
It could be between first and second place right there for this first heat.

1758
02:41:34,265 --> 02:41:35,345
That's the key.

1759
02:41:35,365 --> 02:41:36,866
11-24 needs to be clean here.

1760
02:41:36,926 --> 02:41:38,227
And they just got no reps.

1761
02:41:39,147 --> 02:41:41,449
Got to start the whole rep over again.

1762
02:41:41,969 --> 02:41:43,210
And that's what we've seen with Greater Heights.

1763
02:41:43,450 --> 02:41:47,052
They've actually been very pretty with their reps the entire time.

1764
02:41:49,353 --> 02:41:51,795
Greater Heights is a full rep behind.

1765
02:41:54,995 --> 02:42:00,979
Now we are even, 11.24 is able to hold on.

1766
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:09,725
That's an event win and a heat win, back to back, five big booms for 11.24.

1767
02:42:12,427 --> 02:42:15,349
With greater heights, not that far behind, four seconds.

1768
02:42:26,207 --> 02:42:32,351
Now CrossFit For Friends has done some moving while they've been paying attention to everybody else.

1769
02:42:34,212 --> 02:42:35,853
Here comes Hendersonville Mayhem.

1770
02:42:37,034 --> 02:42:44,639
But already at the worm is the team from For Friends Smart out of Castellon in Spain, one of the first affiliates in Spain.

1771
02:42:46,200 --> 02:42:54,326
Led by Elena Caratalla, who has competed individually at the highest levels of this sport, not only at the CrossFit Games, but at the Rogue Invitational.

1772
02:43:05,509 --> 02:43:07,390
Three more reps for four friends.

1773
02:43:11,273 --> 02:43:14,555
Tommy Martinez and Caratalla all train together, both of them.

1774
02:43:15,796 --> 02:43:20,739
The other two members of this team travel more than 500 kilometers to train on weekends.

1775
02:43:20,819 --> 02:43:23,360
There is some dedication for the Spaniards on the left.

1776
02:43:24,941 --> 02:43:30,485
And with one rep remaining, they will be the third team to finish, 90 seconds ahead of the cap here in Heat 1.

1777
02:43:36,877 --> 02:43:37,557
Hendersonville.

1778
02:43:38,958 --> 02:43:42,219
Last team in, and the fourth team to finish.

1779
02:43:45,880 --> 02:43:49,921
They are filling those worm clean over the shoulders.

1780
02:43:50,302 --> 02:43:51,782
Camp Rhino is across.

1781
02:43:54,423 --> 02:43:57,144
I feel like after this, everybody's going to be excited to squat later.

1782
02:43:58,044 --> 02:44:00,065
Back to the lower body, away from the upper body.

1783
02:44:02,826 --> 02:44:05,327
Devastation at the finish line.

1784
02:44:05,347 --> 02:44:06,447
Yeah, they're hurting.

1785
02:44:07,919 --> 02:44:08,799
undivided finished.

1786
02:44:12,141 --> 02:44:12,781
As they should be.

1787
02:44:12,821 --> 02:44:13,481
They should be hurting.

1788
02:44:13,581 --> 02:44:15,862
That means that they're just leaving it all out there on the floor.

1789
02:44:21,724 --> 02:44:23,445
Final three reps for Prestanda.

1790
02:44:25,646 --> 02:44:27,206
That is Victor Langsvid's box.

1791
02:44:29,747 --> 02:44:34,009
Third athlete from the right.

1792
02:44:34,029 --> 02:44:35,049
30 seconds left to go.

1793
02:44:35,069 --> 02:44:36,790
Here we go, and in.

1794
02:44:38,780 --> 02:44:41,142
Training Think Tank is still back at the rig.

1795
02:44:45,525 --> 02:44:49,068
Body Blueprint is on the worm.

1796
02:44:49,088 --> 02:44:50,109
15 seconds left to go.

1797
02:44:50,529 --> 02:44:54,372
Remember, this is the second time ever as a team Body Blueprint had touched the worm.

1798
02:44:54,392 --> 02:44:55,973
They're all veteran team athletes, though.

1799
02:45:01,217 --> 02:45:07,121
And time will expire on the Body Blueprint crew and TTT.

1800
02:45:10,757 --> 02:45:13,479
By the way, in case we don't get a chance, happy 30th birthday, Bryce Broome.

1801
02:45:13,699 --> 02:45:14,840
Yes.

1802
02:45:14,860 --> 02:45:15,860
That's a good one.

1803
02:45:15,880 --> 02:45:16,361
The big 3-0.

1804
02:45:20,023 --> 02:45:20,183
But 11-24.

1805
02:45:20,243 --> 02:45:26,307
Pose for the benefit of those with flash photography.

1806
02:45:29,409 --> 02:45:30,049
Cindy Smith.

1807
02:45:30,089 --> 02:45:30,810
Yeah, go get your belt.

1808
02:45:30,850 --> 02:45:31,770
You just want to heat.

1809
02:45:34,632 --> 02:45:35,993
Take a look at our replay from Rogue.

1810
02:45:39,497 --> 02:45:42,259
Wow, what a grinder of a workout.

1811
02:45:42,499 --> 02:45:43,640
That was a tough one.

1812
02:45:43,680 --> 02:45:46,122
We had Greater Heights coming out out front.

1813
02:45:46,522 --> 02:45:49,645
Let me tell you, their reps were clean the entire time.

1814
02:45:50,125 --> 02:45:55,409
Those bar muscle-ups started to get a little spicy for actually 11.24.

1815
02:45:56,170 --> 02:46:00,593
And to see them just to continue to move through that, that was amazing.

1816
02:46:01,013 --> 02:46:03,835
Greater Heights stayed in the lead pretty much the entire time.

1817
02:46:04,736 --> 02:46:12,180
Up until the last round, where CrossFit 1124 came with the W right at the end.

1818
02:46:12,220 --> 02:46:13,860
They did have a no rep, though.

1819
02:46:14,260 --> 02:46:17,162
And we were scared that Greater Heights wasn't coming, but 1124 stole that win, and they're excited.

1820
02:46:17,182 --> 02:46:17,662
Time to beat.

1821
02:46:17,682 --> 02:46:17,662
16, 59, 45.

1822
02:46:18,082 --> 02:46:18,843
We'll see how that holds up.

1823
02:46:20,183 --> 02:46:22,124
And then 17, 03 for Greater Heights.

1824
02:46:35,795 --> 02:46:40,578
still have 10 more teams to go on event number five for the 2025 CrossFit Games teams.

1825
02:47:06,670 --> 02:47:09,094
This is the 2025 CrossFit Games.

1826
02:47:09,154 --> 02:47:12,238
We are at MVP Arena in Albany, New York.

1827
02:47:12,278 --> 02:47:15,583
Today's coverage is presented by Veletas.

1828
02:47:15,904 --> 02:47:19,690
We are Veletas, and we are made not born.

1829
02:47:21,776 --> 02:47:26,780
with Bethany Flores, seven-time CrossFit Games athlete out of PAC CrossFit.

1830
02:47:27,080 --> 02:47:29,502
Miss Bella Martin out of CrossFit Mayhem down on the floor.

1831
02:47:29,542 --> 02:47:32,165
My name is Joel Godet from Resilience CrossFit in Medfield.

1832
02:47:32,185 --> 02:47:40,091
The rest of our crew, glad to have you with us for Heat 2 of Event 5 here at the CrossFit Games for the teams.

1833
02:47:40,191 --> 02:47:44,095
Campbell City CrossFit wearing the white and red leaders jerseys

1834
02:47:44,735 --> 02:47:57,986
With 335 points, a 10-point lead over CrossFit Butcher's Lab, those top two teams between their eight athletes have three previous CrossFit Games appearances on a team.

1835
02:47:59,027 --> 02:47:59,607
Incredible.

1836
02:48:00,448 --> 02:48:01,789
Sometimes it's better not to know.

1837
02:48:02,470 --> 02:48:04,531
Here's your event description brought to us by the U.S.

1838
02:48:04,591 --> 02:48:05,232
Border Patrol.

1839
02:48:05,272 --> 02:48:06,333
Be an agent of strength.

1840
02:48:07,535 --> 02:48:08,915
They're going to do six total rounds.

1841
02:48:08,995 --> 02:48:14,456
The first three rounds are 40 synchro chest-to-bar pull-ups and 10 worm clean overs and backs.

1842
02:48:14,857 --> 02:48:23,498
Then they're doing three rounds of 28 synchro bar muscle-ups and seven worm clean over and backs with the male-male and a female-female pair.

1843
02:48:23,518 --> 02:48:27,119
It's going to be a grinder and a spaghetti mouse at the same time.

1844
02:48:28,580 --> 02:48:29,660
The cap is 20 minutes.

1845
02:48:29,680 --> 02:48:31,140
The time to beat is 16.59.

1846
02:48:31,700 --> 02:48:34,341
Our recipe for success brought to us by Tempo.

1847
02:48:34,381 --> 02:48:35,401
Let's get gymnastic.

1848
02:48:35,692 --> 02:48:37,333
Yeah, the first one is get your massy.

1849
02:48:37,373 --> 02:48:40,273
It's a lot of work with the bar muscle ups and the chest to bars.

1850
02:48:40,293 --> 02:48:41,774
So we're going to see how that impacts them.

1851
02:48:42,234 --> 02:48:44,395
And then the second one is you're going to have to grind it out.

1852
02:48:44,655 --> 02:48:51,837
This is one where it's a long workout, a long time cap, and we're going to see how they do when it comes to the end and how they're feeling.

1853
02:48:53,488 --> 02:48:57,911
The art of being in first, a third, a second, a third, and an eighth.

1854
02:48:58,392 --> 02:49:02,435
Those points will add up to a spot in lane five for Camel City CrossFit.

1855
02:49:02,995 --> 02:49:04,196
Butcher's Lab in second.

1856
02:49:04,276 --> 02:49:09,140
CrossFit Mayhem is in third, three lanes over the middle of the floor.

1857
02:49:10,421 --> 02:49:11,202
Down to Miss Bellamartin.

1858
02:49:12,152 --> 02:49:14,713
How can you not like Camel City CrossFit?

1859
02:49:14,753 --> 02:49:20,854
We've got two Masters Games females, a police officer and a firefighter, all on the same team, training out of one affiliate.

1860
02:49:20,894 --> 02:49:23,175
If that's not CrossFit, I don't know what is.

1861
02:49:23,515 --> 02:49:29,576
This team came in definitely as an underdog team, but they're in the leaders jerseys, and that's got to feel good.

1862
02:49:29,636 --> 02:49:30,876
We caught up with them this morning.

1863
02:49:31,216 --> 02:49:36,778
They said they were a little bit surprised based on how everything's going, but they're trying to stay composed, under control.

1864
02:49:36,938 --> 02:49:40,639
And tell you what, guys, this is the second time they've seen the worm together as a team.

1865
02:49:40,799 --> 02:49:42,019
They said they have a worm at the gym.

1866
02:49:42,439 --> 02:49:44,162
But they can't get together in time to do it.

1867
02:49:44,282 --> 02:49:49,008
So we'll see if their communication pays off in this one and if they can keep those leaders jerseys on for the rest of the day.

1868
02:49:49,850 --> 02:49:54,052
Our team to watch, Vision Fuels Victory from Zeni.

1869
02:49:54,913 --> 02:49:57,174
Leaders jerseys for that Camel City team.

1870
02:49:57,214 --> 02:49:58,214
And yes, they have a worm.

1871
02:49:58,274 --> 02:50:02,116
No, they don't get to use it a lot because of the fact they all got jobs.

1872
02:50:02,957 --> 02:50:05,538
This is a team of people that do CrossFit.

1873
02:50:05,638 --> 02:50:13,942
Bella alluded to the fact that you've got a firefighter, a cop, an RDN, registered dietitian, and an affiliate owner coming together in their free time.

1874
02:50:14,062 --> 02:50:15,183
And they are in first place.

1875
02:50:15,763 --> 02:50:16,784
I love to see it, Bethany.

1876
02:50:16,804 --> 02:50:17,744
They will love to see it.

1877
02:50:17,784 --> 02:50:19,085
They were kind of shocked themselves.

1878
02:50:19,165 --> 02:50:23,448
Yes, sometimes it's better that way for the mindset coming into it.

1879
02:50:23,808 --> 02:50:24,749
No one's thinking about you.

1880
02:50:24,789 --> 02:50:25,770
No one's looking at you.

1881
02:50:26,230 --> 02:50:30,153
You can just kind of be free out there and that's exactly what's happening and what happened on day one.

1882
02:50:30,373 --> 02:50:33,475
And sometimes you end up with the leader jersey on nice.

1883
02:50:34,191 --> 02:50:37,492
Starting with those 40 chest-to-bar pull-ups, they are done in sets of 10.

1884
02:50:38,692 --> 02:50:41,293
You cannot switch before or after 10.

1885
02:50:41,873 --> 02:50:43,594
You can break, but you can't switch.

1886
02:50:44,134 --> 02:50:45,835
Male-male, female-female pairs.

1887
02:50:46,695 --> 02:50:48,175
And we're gonna see how those add up.

1888
02:50:48,735 --> 02:51:00,179
I have a feeling that it's gonna get a little spicy, probably when they get more to the bar muscle-ups and trying to do the clean over and backs, but we'll see how everyone handles all of those chest-to-bar pull-ups.

1889
02:51:00,759 --> 02:51:03,220
CrossFit Oslo is the first team to the worm.

1890
02:51:05,204 --> 02:51:11,787
Now, communication will be interesting for Oslo in lane seven, because that team has trained together a lot, for three of them.

1891
02:51:12,267 --> 02:51:17,629
But Kristen Holta was a late sub, coming in to replace Ingrid Hodenmeier, injured last week.

1892
02:51:18,049 --> 02:51:20,811
However, Kristen Holta is one of the greatest CrossFit athletes of all time.

1893
02:51:21,331 --> 02:51:22,131
She is, she is.

1894
02:51:22,531 --> 02:51:26,013
But, the only thing is, caveat is, she's the greatest, indeed.

1895
02:51:27,083 --> 02:51:29,405
So we don't touch the worm in individual.

1896
02:51:29,945 --> 02:51:35,809
That might be a little tough for her, but hopefully she's been taking notes as the team's been getting ready, and we'll see how they do.

1897
02:51:38,210 --> 02:51:42,133
In heat one, the fastest chest-to-bar time in the first round was 52 seconds.

1898
02:51:42,333 --> 02:51:44,695
Oslo beat that by tenths of a second.

1899
02:51:46,996 --> 02:51:48,617
Time to watch is 16.59.

1900
02:51:49,698 --> 02:51:51,539
We are a long ways away from that.

1901
02:51:51,619 --> 02:51:55,202
This is a grinder of a test to start day two.

1902
02:51:56,818 --> 02:52:00,202
And we did have a team at the ranch to test this out, and they got 20-05.

1903
02:52:00,222 --> 02:52:03,986
So they time capped.

1904
02:52:04,686 --> 02:52:10,933
But we had a lot of people finish in the first heat, so I'm expecting to see that here in the second heat as well.

1905
02:52:12,915 --> 02:52:15,678
Oslo is second back to the rig.

1906
02:52:16,219 --> 02:52:19,122
Lara Pair beats them by just a couple of steps.

1907
02:52:20,828 --> 02:52:22,949
And they had a good showing yesterday with the gymnastics movements.

1908
02:52:23,369 --> 02:52:28,252
So I expect no less with the bar muscle ups and the chest to bar.

1909
02:52:34,216 --> 02:52:36,697
Same thing here in round two and in round three.

1910
02:52:36,957 --> 02:52:40,339
It is the sets of 10 chest to bars until your team accumulates 40.

1911
02:52:42,880 --> 02:52:45,122
And you can choose every round with your pair.

1912
02:52:45,422 --> 02:52:47,083
You can decide who wants to go first.

1913
02:52:47,143 --> 02:52:49,264
So if the males are feeling a little tired,

1914
02:52:50,096 --> 02:52:51,276
maybe the females go first.

1915
02:52:51,356 --> 02:52:54,037
And then the next round, females feel a little tired, then the males go first.

1916
02:52:54,057 --> 02:52:54,977
Let's check in with Bella.

1917
02:52:55,757 --> 02:53:00,259
I'm on the floor watching La Repair, and they had a solid first day.

1918
02:53:00,539 --> 02:53:03,059
And they're having an even better show out day two.

1919
02:53:03,359 --> 02:53:06,020
We've got two gymnasts and two lifters on this team.

1920
02:53:06,300 --> 02:53:09,181
So if there's anybody that's going to be balanced on the floor, it's these guys.

1921
02:53:09,521 --> 02:53:12,842
They're going to try to get an event win, but they're going to have to catch Oslo.

1922
02:53:12,862 --> 02:53:16,863
But I think their communication might be what gets them across this line first, Joel.

1923
02:53:17,984 --> 02:53:22,051
Well, they are just behind Oslo right now, making their way to the worm.

1924
02:53:22,151 --> 02:53:25,336
Oslo has completed one of the 10 worm up and overs.

1925
02:53:32,139 --> 02:53:33,980
I'm loving those hot pink shoes out there.

1926
02:53:34,481 --> 02:53:36,542
Those look pretty great.

1927
02:53:37,823 --> 02:53:41,887
You talk to the people at home, like, how do we find you when we're watching on the screen?

1928
02:53:42,107 --> 02:53:43,588
Look for the bright pink shoes.

1929
02:53:45,089 --> 02:53:48,472
I mean, honestly, as a competitor, I do that, too.

1930
02:53:48,652 --> 02:53:52,215
Just for like your family and friends out in the stands.

1931
02:53:52,495 --> 02:53:54,497
They want to see those shoes that they can point you out.

1932
02:53:54,597 --> 02:53:56,038
So good on them for doing that.

1933
02:53:58,105 --> 02:54:00,667
Hand is in the air for both Lara Pair and Oslo.

1934
02:54:00,687 --> 02:54:10,212
David George is on the wrong team.

1935
02:54:10,252 --> 02:54:13,054
She's got the bright pink over there.

1936
02:54:13,234 --> 02:54:16,076
She didn't communicate with her team to get the hot pink on.

1937
02:54:18,097 --> 02:54:19,418
Final wrap on the second.

1938
02:54:19,838 --> 02:54:22,240
Worm up and overs and Oslo will advance.

1939
02:54:23,961 --> 02:54:29,684
And they'll head back to the rig for another round of chest-to-bar and the final round of chest-to-bar.

1940
02:54:30,604 --> 02:54:41,369
Another note, too, with the team, they have to get all of their members across that thick yellow line before they start doing their gymnastics movements, which is kind of nice, right, Joel?

1941
02:54:41,389 --> 02:54:42,470
I don't know.

1942
02:54:42,650 --> 02:54:44,390
I like that because they get a little bit of a rest.

1943
02:54:44,771 --> 02:54:48,152
But yeah, if they do that, that is some costly no reps.

1944
02:54:48,172 --> 02:54:49,633
Don't don't get silly like that.

1945
02:54:51,005 --> 02:54:54,168
Kind of makes it like a team workout and your affiliate on a Saturday, right?

1946
02:54:54,188 --> 02:54:57,751
You can't start the next movement until everybody finishes and returns from their run.

1947
02:54:57,952 --> 02:54:58,232
True.

1948
02:55:00,294 --> 02:55:00,874
All about teamwork.

1949
02:55:02,136 --> 02:55:03,116
Which we love to see on team.

1950
02:55:03,937 --> 02:55:04,518
More of that, please.

1951
02:55:10,152 --> 02:55:12,313
Ptolemyr Akinyo finishing with Viktor Helsingov.

1952
02:55:12,774 --> 02:55:15,015
And now look at the way that Oslo is doing this, right?

1953
02:55:15,195 --> 02:55:17,897
They're not swapping athletes in and out, right?

1954
02:55:17,937 --> 02:55:21,439
They're putting themselves next to each other and just popping up and down off the rig.

1955
02:55:21,859 --> 02:55:25,961
It's saving milliseconds, but those can matter.

1956
02:55:28,903 --> 02:55:30,584
Everything counts if everything adds up.

1957
02:55:30,744 --> 02:55:39,069
So those little things are veteran moves for sure, even though maybe those four haven't worked together on a team at the games.

1958
02:55:40,263 --> 02:55:47,246
Tola has, what, seven appearances at the games on different teams, so he definitely has his own veteran experience.

1959
02:55:48,906 --> 02:55:51,527
Butcher's Lab has made up some ground.

1960
02:55:52,007 --> 02:55:53,308
They're now in second place.

1961
02:55:53,408 --> 02:55:55,769
Lara Pair is just behind them in third.

1962
02:55:55,789 --> 02:56:00,210
And then Franco's at the top of your screen is in fourth.

1963
02:56:01,211 --> 02:56:02,171
Here is Lara Pair.

1964
02:56:02,191 --> 02:56:04,032
With the hot pink shoes on.

1965
02:56:05,286 --> 02:56:06,387
And they've got a nice fan base.

1966
02:56:06,447 --> 02:56:08,248
It's a fairly easy drive.

1967
02:56:08,268 --> 02:56:13,451
Yeah, but they should have wore hot pink shirts to go with the hot pink shoes.

1968
02:56:13,651 --> 02:56:14,952
I'm a little disappointed.

1969
02:56:16,073 --> 02:56:17,294
They have maple leafs on those shirts.

1970
02:56:17,354 --> 02:56:18,154
OK, all right, all right.

1971
02:56:20,196 --> 02:56:20,716
Counts for something.

1972
02:56:23,938 --> 02:56:28,281
Le Repair is led by Audrey-Anne Peridupuy, the 21-year-old affiliate owner.

1973
02:56:28,301 --> 02:56:30,582
Excuse me, now 23-year-old affiliate owner.

1974
02:56:34,044 --> 02:56:34,565
That's really young.

1975
02:56:35,641 --> 02:56:37,002
helped buy into the affiliate when she was 18.

1976
02:56:37,723 --> 02:56:41,826
Wow, that's impressive.

1977
02:56:41,846 --> 02:56:43,928
630 into our 20 minute time cap.

1978
02:56:44,228 --> 02:56:48,171
And as Oslo advances the worm, they are halfway through this test.

1979
02:56:48,571 --> 02:56:59,600
As far as rounds right now, fewer reps in these back three rounds, but halfway through at the 650 mark, they're going to obliterate the time to be impressive.

1980
02:57:01,708 --> 02:57:05,851
I am interested to see how these bar muscle-ups start adding up.

1981
02:57:06,612 --> 02:57:12,396
You do have to do it synchro, so you have to pause at the top to make sure that you're staying synchro with your partner.

1982
02:57:12,456 --> 02:57:16,479
And I don't know, that's gonna get a little spicy on those triceps.

1983
02:57:16,639 --> 02:57:19,902
So we'll see how the worm is in the second half of this.

1984
02:57:22,684 --> 02:57:26,526
The crew is returning to the rig, but Oslo has a comfortable lead.

1985
02:57:26,546 --> 02:57:29,729
As soon as the women drop, that means they're halfway through here.

1986
02:57:31,244 --> 02:57:33,986
That'll be 14 bar muscle-ups in the bank.

1987
02:57:36,168 --> 02:57:38,449
And you're going to see different versions of the bar muscle-up.

1988
02:57:39,050 --> 02:57:43,473
Some people come a little bit higher with their knees and do more of like a kipping gymnastics movement.

1989
02:57:43,933 --> 02:57:47,295
And then some people are more vertical and just have a huge arch.

1990
02:57:48,056 --> 02:57:50,578
I think it's just going to depend on comfortability.

1991
02:57:50,738 --> 02:57:54,180
And sometimes that gymnastics background, you're going to bring your knees a little bit higher.

1992
02:57:54,200 --> 02:57:54,601
That's what I do.

1993
02:57:55,595 --> 02:58:00,316
This is the 20th of 28 bar muscle-ups for Oslo Kreiger, now 21.

1994
02:58:01,017 --> 02:58:02,297
And they'll break final seven.

1995
02:58:03,117 --> 02:58:04,298
Those belong to the ladies.

1996
02:58:04,458 --> 02:58:06,919
Those are your top three teams right across your screen.

1997
02:58:12,100 --> 02:58:15,601
And I like that they're facing each other instead of just on the same bar.

1998
02:58:16,201 --> 02:58:19,602
You don't have to go as narrow with your grip on the chest-to-bar or the bar muscle-ups.

1999
02:58:19,722 --> 02:58:24,404
So I'm pretty sure they're thinking CrossFit right now and how they decided to set it up this year.

2000
02:58:25,565 --> 02:58:26,726
to stare into your partner's eyes.

2001
02:58:26,886 --> 02:58:29,569
It was like the double unders yesterday.

2002
02:58:30,649 --> 02:58:31,150
Final rep.

2003
02:58:33,272 --> 02:58:35,754
Linda Kvam and Holta drop and back to the worm.

2004
02:58:35,794 --> 02:58:39,077
We are now on a round of seven worm up and overs.

2005
02:58:41,439 --> 02:58:45,463
Incredibly impressive here for the way that this team has moved through this.

2006
02:58:45,943 --> 02:58:48,886
Again, we talked about how experienced Kristen Holta is in CrossFit.

2007
02:58:49,665 --> 02:58:53,208
She's never competed on a team at the games and she's been on this team for a week.

2008
02:58:56,130 --> 02:58:56,810
Very impressive.

2009
02:58:57,410 --> 02:59:00,593
That goes to veteran leadership, communication.

2010
02:59:00,613 --> 02:59:05,636
I mean, Tola Maracanio clearly, who is the team master, is in control of this situation.

2011
02:59:05,656 --> 02:59:08,198
She's a mom?

2012
02:59:09,279 --> 02:59:10,260
Yeah, yeah, Cristin Alta.

2013
02:59:11,893 --> 02:59:12,653
I think that kind of helps.

2014
02:59:12,713 --> 02:59:17,095
You're just like, I don't know, you're more level-headed, a little bit more calm.

2015
02:59:17,835 --> 02:59:19,776
Osla won the first two events yesterday.

2016
02:59:19,796 --> 02:59:25,858
It was the third time in games history a team won the first two events and the first time Rich Froning wasn't on that team.

2017
02:59:26,618 --> 02:59:29,879
But then took a 17th in event three.

2018
02:59:29,919 --> 02:59:31,500
That dropped them off the podium.

2019
02:59:32,280 --> 02:59:37,022
Right now 30 points out of first place, but they are gonna make up some serious ground.

2020
02:59:38,724 --> 02:59:42,666
Five points is the difference between each placing with every event the rest of the way.

2021
02:59:43,847 --> 02:59:47,229
And Oslo is back to its second set of 28 bar muscle ups.

2022
02:59:48,350 --> 02:59:49,550
And the guys will go first.

2023
02:59:51,471 --> 02:59:54,293
And Layer Repair is kind of falling off the pace a little bit.

2024
02:59:54,433 --> 02:59:59,036
I saw they failed a couple of bar muscle ups with the guys, so it's costly.

2025
02:59:59,076 --> 03:00:00,737
Any type of no rep, very costly.

2026
03:00:03,838 --> 03:00:05,840
Elsingoff with a great handball background.

2027
03:00:06,938 --> 03:00:09,119
It's a really big sport up in the Nordic countries.

2028
03:00:10,460 --> 03:00:12,921
Maracanio, former wrestler.

2029
03:00:16,603 --> 03:00:18,403
Lindigvam, also a great handball player.

2030
03:00:18,423 --> 03:00:21,045
Played 13 years of it.

2031
03:00:25,414 --> 03:00:28,215
They're all team athletes, like they've all been on teams.

2032
03:00:28,435 --> 03:00:32,057
So Kristen Holta felt pretty confident saying, hey, I've been an individual athlete.

2033
03:00:32,717 --> 03:00:34,898
My team knows what it's like to be on a team, though.

2034
03:00:34,918 --> 03:00:38,680
I'm going to blend in if I just kind of play along.

2035
03:00:38,940 --> 03:00:43,802
And I think when you're one of the best on the individual side, I think you can adapt and overcome.

2036
03:00:43,842 --> 03:00:45,323
That's just being an athlete.

2037
03:00:46,083 --> 03:00:49,225
So it's really showing right now with this workout.

2038
03:00:51,638 --> 03:00:58,141
And having a team background sports with some of these other athletes, like, that definitely helps when it comes to team and being at the games.

2039
03:01:09,807 --> 03:01:12,268
Final five reps for Oslo Kreiger.

2040
03:01:14,549 --> 03:01:16,170
Kreiger, of course, the training program.

2041
03:01:17,310 --> 03:01:20,832
It has two full-time employees, Joachim Riding and Kristen Holten.

2042
03:01:21,780 --> 03:01:24,844
And then a host of coaches.

2043
03:01:24,924 --> 03:01:27,768
Those triceps are probably on fire.

2044
03:01:30,050 --> 03:01:32,794
This is getting tough with the bar muscle, especially for the females.

2045
03:01:40,474 --> 03:01:44,238
CrossFit and Norway just go hand in hand over the last few years.

2046
03:01:44,999 --> 03:01:47,501
The country has committed to it on the national level.

2047
03:01:47,882 --> 03:01:49,283
The boxes have exploded.

2048
03:01:49,343 --> 03:01:52,026
CrossFit Oslo has almost a thousand members.

2049
03:01:52,606 --> 03:01:57,471
They have three separate rooms where they can run multiple classes out of simultaneously.

2050
03:01:58,933 --> 03:02:01,536
It has been an incredible culture growth.

2051
03:02:02,387 --> 03:02:06,152
No European team has ever finished on top of the podium at the CrossFit Games though.

2052
03:02:06,172 --> 03:02:09,916
CrossFit Oslo has that opportunity here in 2025.

2053
03:02:09,976 --> 03:02:11,959
They do have a chance.

2054
03:02:13,120 --> 03:02:15,984
Butcher's Lab right behind them in second place.

2055
03:02:17,305 --> 03:02:18,886
And they were excited for this workout.

2056
03:02:19,126 --> 03:02:24,128
We talked to them in the warm-up area, and they were like, yes to the worm, yes to communication.

2057
03:02:24,628 --> 03:02:25,509
We talked in heat one.

2058
03:02:25,549 --> 03:02:27,529
Many teams haven't worked with worms a lot.

2059
03:02:27,910 --> 03:02:35,153
If you walk in the door of Butcher's Lab in the meatpacking district of Copenhagen, there are like four worms stacked up on shelves.

2060
03:02:35,573 --> 03:02:37,974
They got all sorts of worms to work on.

2061
03:02:38,034 --> 03:02:38,774
Are they full of meat?

2062
03:02:39,975 --> 03:02:41,876
That would be fitting.

2063
03:02:43,616 --> 03:02:44,417
Would be fitting.

2064
03:02:44,757 --> 03:02:45,437
At least one of them.

2065
03:02:45,717 --> 03:02:46,758
Hard to keep sanitary.

2066
03:02:48,178 --> 03:02:49,079
I mean, it's covered.

2067
03:02:49,279 --> 03:02:49,819
It's fine.

2068
03:02:49,839 --> 03:02:52,181
Then they can cook it afterward.

2069
03:02:53,823 --> 03:02:56,625
Oh, back for their final bar muscle-ups.

2070
03:02:58,787 --> 03:02:59,948
Ain't you be giving people ideas?

2071
03:03:00,088 --> 03:03:11,097
Hey, if you don't have a worm, maybe you can just pack a bunch of meat together and make your own worm.

2072
03:03:11,357 --> 03:03:13,039
28 muscle-ups on this final round.

2073
03:03:16,101 --> 03:03:16,842
This is Franco's.

2074
03:03:20,458 --> 03:03:21,319
Jordan Kerr.

2075
03:03:21,839 --> 03:03:23,260
They got some strong people on their team.

2076
03:03:23,280 --> 03:03:24,982
Yeah, they're looking forward to the back squat.

2077
03:03:25,022 --> 03:03:25,222
Yes.

2078
03:03:26,183 --> 03:03:27,804
Very excited about the back squat.

2079
03:03:28,644 --> 03:03:30,686
Oh, and Oslo has run into a little bit of a snag here.

2080
03:03:30,806 --> 03:03:32,568
Oh, did Kristen Holta's grip rip?

2081
03:03:33,248 --> 03:03:33,929
Wow.

2082
03:03:35,230 --> 03:03:37,431
Kristen Holta's right grip ripped.

2083
03:03:39,093 --> 03:03:40,834
You just got to go barehanded.

2084
03:03:41,334 --> 03:03:44,377
It either ripped or she just needs more chalk on it.

2085
03:03:47,299 --> 03:03:50,741
And excuse me, that's Uda closest to us right next to Tola.

2086
03:03:52,122 --> 03:03:57,646
Yeah, she's going back to that right hand a bunch.

2087
03:03:57,766 --> 03:04:00,949
I don't know if she just slipped, if the grip gave up on her.

2088
03:04:03,985 --> 03:04:06,947
Either way, this is the stuff that sometimes doesn't happen in training.

2089
03:04:07,647 --> 03:04:08,988
You can't really prepare for it.

2090
03:04:09,888 --> 03:04:12,990
And you just have to make do when you're in that position.

2091
03:04:13,350 --> 03:04:15,031
And that's why it's nice to have teammates.

2092
03:04:15,071 --> 03:04:17,553
I saw Tola trying to help her out a lot during that.

2093
03:04:20,374 --> 03:04:22,756
Now, here's the thing to think about from the overall picture.

2094
03:04:23,556 --> 03:04:25,317
Final four reps here for Oslo.

2095
03:04:25,377 --> 03:04:28,379
And Udo Lundeklom is going to go back to the chalk on that right hand.

2096
03:04:29,680 --> 03:04:31,321
Camel City is nowhere to be seen.

2097
03:04:31,882 --> 03:04:35,025
And they are in first place right now, but not by the largest margin.

2098
03:04:35,465 --> 03:04:38,488
Only 15 points, three spots ahead of Butcher's Lab.

2099
03:04:38,848 --> 03:04:41,591
So Oslo can finish first here, it's gonna help their case a lot.

2100
03:04:42,031 --> 03:04:51,900
But if Butcher's Lab, who right now is in second, finishes in second, we may very well see Butcher's Lab wearing the leader's jersey heading into our next event.

2101
03:04:53,676 --> 03:04:58,377
which they need because I know for them with the back squat workout, it's not gonna be their greatest.

2102
03:04:58,798 --> 03:05:01,338
So they need all the points they can get during this workout.

2103
03:05:01,879 --> 03:05:07,680
If Campbell City finishes in fourth or worse, that puts Butcher's Lab ahead of them.

2104
03:05:07,861 --> 03:05:09,861
Right now, Campbell City is in fifth.

2105
03:05:10,761 --> 03:05:15,963
Oslo is the first team to the worm here for the final seven worm clean up and overs.

2106
03:05:17,003 --> 03:05:18,684
Maracanio calling the shots up front.

2107
03:05:22,049 --> 03:05:24,911
Right now, it's all about just one rep at a time.

2108
03:05:25,351 --> 03:05:26,312
Don't get ahead of yourself.

2109
03:05:26,853 --> 03:05:28,534
Breathe, be where your feet are at.

2110
03:05:29,014 --> 03:05:30,956
And you got a minute and a half until the time to beat.

2111
03:05:31,276 --> 03:05:32,517
Nobody close to you.

2112
03:05:35,299 --> 03:05:42,124
Butcher's Lab is in second, but it's going to be one and two unless something goes terribly wrong.

2113
03:05:43,405 --> 03:05:44,786
Franco's coming up behind.

2114
03:05:48,540 --> 03:06:14,655
oslo looking for its third event win of the 2025 crossfit games and crossfit oslo inching closer into contention three event wins they needed that they needed that one that was good that should put them back into a podium spot after that 17th on event three yesterday knocked them out butcher's lap

2115
03:06:20,018 --> 03:06:22,579
That communication, beautiful.

2116
03:06:23,580 --> 03:06:26,421
Butcher's Lab across, that is second place.

2117
03:06:27,242 --> 03:06:31,143
And now here comes Camel City in the white leader tops.

2118
03:06:32,584 --> 03:06:35,105
But Franco's has finished, that's third.

2119
03:06:35,886 --> 03:06:37,846
Mayhem is ahead of Camel City.

2120
03:06:39,787 --> 03:06:41,388
Camel City right, Mayhem left.

2121
03:06:42,649 --> 03:06:47,511
If Mayhem beats Camel City here, the leader's jersey changes heading into our next event.

2122
03:06:54,126 --> 03:06:57,048
And Campbell City just got a no rep, so that was pretty costly.

2123
03:06:57,248 --> 03:07:00,249
Oh, and you know what?

2124
03:07:00,709 --> 03:07:02,390
Time to beat coming in to be a factor.

2125
03:07:02,650 --> 03:07:04,031
Leader's jersey is changing.

2126
03:07:04,311 --> 03:07:11,515
Mayhem comes across, and the 16.59 from Heat 1, 11.24, that also will beat Campbell City.

2127
03:07:12,355 --> 03:07:16,097
So CrossFit Butcher's Lab is your new overall leader.

2128
03:07:18,237 --> 03:07:23,441
And Camel City is in a little bit of damage control here, trying to stay in the fight.

2129
03:07:24,902 --> 03:07:25,342
There we go.

2130
03:07:25,662 --> 03:07:26,543
They come across.

2131
03:07:28,484 --> 03:07:36,090
And that's where you can see, like, teams that have used the worm before and have that communication and teams that don't.

2132
03:07:36,110 --> 03:07:37,931
17.24 was the final time for Camel City.

2133
03:07:38,191 --> 03:07:42,094
Multiple Heat 1 times are coming in to be an impact there.

2134
03:07:42,634 --> 03:07:44,256
Greater Heights had a better score.

2135
03:07:45,203 --> 03:07:47,744
and each placing is five points on the leaderboard.

2136
03:07:48,645 --> 03:08:00,169
That's why even if you're in that first heat, you have to give everything you got because those times are factored in.

2137
03:08:01,730 --> 03:08:07,012
Dylan Hemming is barking commands, eighth day ripping through this final round of seven.

2138
03:08:13,033 --> 03:08:19,015
To be honest, that's actually really impressive, because this is at the end of a 20-minute workout almost, and you're exhausted and you're yelling.

2139
03:08:19,515 --> 03:08:20,615
That's the fitness right there.

2140
03:08:20,655 --> 03:08:22,176
And it keeps you going.

2141
03:08:22,216 --> 03:08:23,856
No time for rest.

2142
03:08:26,337 --> 03:08:30,158
Here comes Proven.

2143
03:08:30,398 --> 03:08:31,899
90 seconds left before the cap.

2144
03:08:33,399 --> 03:08:35,220
Everybody should finish.

2145
03:08:35,980 --> 03:08:39,501
And if you had any doubt as to which team this is, check the shoes.

2146
03:08:40,761 --> 03:08:42,502
That is La Repair in the bright pink.

2147
03:08:47,617 --> 03:08:48,818
They did run into a snag.

2148
03:08:49,159 --> 03:08:50,941
Remember, they were in second at one point.

2149
03:08:53,324 --> 03:08:56,207
But LeRipere is through.

2150
03:08:58,029 --> 03:09:00,872
And all 10 teams finish in Heat 2.

2151
03:09:06,970 --> 03:09:10,951
Five events down for the teams at the 2025 CrossFit Games.

2152
03:09:11,211 --> 03:09:15,552
Oslo Kreiger wins the event, vaults up the leaderboard.

2153
03:09:16,493 --> 03:09:25,095
But the bigger story is who came in second, and that's Butcher's Lab, who we expect to be your overall leader when they take the floor again today.

2154
03:09:27,037 --> 03:09:29,818
Wow, and this workout was a grinder.

2155
03:09:29,838 --> 03:09:34,481
We saw Oslo coming out hot at the beginning, and they held pace.

2156
03:09:34,761 --> 03:09:39,903
We were surprised, but we had Lea Repair and Butcher Slab close behind.

2157
03:09:40,503 --> 03:09:45,566
We see them on the worm right now, and communication was important, do or die.

2158
03:09:46,286 --> 03:09:51,669
As we see Oslo just moving forward through each round, just staying ahead the entire time.

2159
03:09:52,249 --> 03:09:53,910
And then when they got to the bar muscle-ups,

2160
03:09:54,898 --> 03:09:57,601
We saw Leigh Ripere almost making a move.

2161
03:09:57,781 --> 03:10:02,646
Then we start seeing some mishaps on their team with a costly no rep, which got them behind.

2162
03:10:03,167 --> 03:10:05,989
Then we saw Oslo with the win.

2163
03:10:06,550 --> 03:10:07,091
She win.

2164
03:10:09,997 --> 03:10:10,838
Oslo in 1556.

2165
03:10:12,460 --> 03:10:14,062
Campbell City winds up in seventh.

2166
03:10:14,182 --> 03:10:16,224
So two times from heat one.

2167
03:10:16,725 --> 03:10:23,472
Get in ahead of Campbell City, who were your leaders coming in as we wrap up our highlights from Rogue.

2168
03:10:24,033 --> 03:10:24,914
Bella Martin, though.

2169
03:10:25,434 --> 03:10:27,875
You know, every team has a different way to get to the games.

2170
03:10:28,196 --> 03:10:30,237
For Butcher's Lab, they made cookies.

2171
03:10:30,277 --> 03:10:31,117
They were very good.

2172
03:10:31,177 --> 03:10:33,599
They sold them at the gym to help pay their way here.

2173
03:10:33,619 --> 03:10:38,461
And it's paid off because they are unofficially your new overall leaders.

2174
03:10:39,082 --> 03:10:39,882
They are with Bella Martin.

2175
03:10:42,023 --> 03:10:47,026
Pernilla, I want to congratulate you guys on unofficially an event win as a team.

2176
03:10:47,226 --> 03:10:51,869
First time ever, but also you will unofficially be wearing those leaders jerseys for the rest of the day.

2177
03:10:51,989 --> 03:10:53,470
How does that feel to you as a new team?

2178
03:10:54,553 --> 03:11:00,896
It feels amazing, like I'm so proud of the whole team because this is our rookie year.

2179
03:11:01,377 --> 03:11:12,562
We have never been to the game, but I know these people are so fit, and we have worked so hard, and we have so much fun together, and we are really a great team.

2180
03:11:13,543 --> 03:11:17,065
You are a very good team that has a lot of team communication skills.

2181
03:11:17,385 --> 03:11:21,287
What did you need to do for this event to take second place and then now move into the first?

2182
03:11:22,007 --> 03:11:29,753
We needed to work together as a team and communicate with each other on the room and also on the gymnastic.

2183
03:11:30,013 --> 03:11:31,735
Like, who is going first?

2184
03:11:32,455 --> 03:11:36,659
Who is having that extra energy to keep it going?

2185
03:11:37,339 --> 03:11:39,481
And I think we just did that perfect.

2186
03:11:40,662 --> 03:11:47,247
We've heard you guys are a long way from home, and your friends and family have supported you all the way here through cookies and a couple of bake sales.

2187
03:11:47,528 --> 03:11:49,990
What do you have to say to them back home to your gym community?

2188
03:11:50,782 --> 03:11:56,887
Butcher's Lab, thank you so much for cheering us up every day, supporting us, and for all our friends.

2189
03:11:57,428 --> 03:12:02,172
We are just so happy for your support.

2190
03:12:02,612 --> 03:12:07,677
And for our family and friends who are here supporting us, we are so happy you are here.

2191
03:12:09,058 --> 03:12:10,759
There's nothing like the love of affiliates.

2192
03:12:11,000 --> 03:12:11,880
Congratulations, guys.

2193
03:12:11,920 --> 03:12:12,241
Great job.

2194
03:12:14,333 --> 03:12:15,735
Congratulations to Butcher's Lab.

2195
03:12:15,755 --> 03:12:17,316
They come in second on the event.

2196
03:12:17,357 --> 03:12:22,843
They are unofficially your new overall leaders, where you can find out if they are officially the overall leaders.

2197
03:12:23,323 --> 03:12:26,847
That's what we call a cliffhanger at games.crossfit.com.

2198
03:12:27,268 --> 03:12:30,291
Statistics, leaderboards, event descriptions, and more.

2199
03:12:30,672 --> 03:12:33,015
Men's Event 5 is coming up next.

2200
03:12:47,878 --> 03:12:53,503
The 2025 CrossFit Games are brought to you by CrossFit, forging elite fitness.

2201
03:13:07,458 --> 03:13:08,879
CrossFit is my social time.

2202
03:13:10,039 --> 03:13:18,984
And I think that is true for a lot of the people that come there because they're my friends, they're my family.

2203
03:13:20,304 --> 03:13:22,585
And we welcome everybody.

2204
03:13:23,186 --> 03:13:30,069
Our wall in the front is, you come and visit, you're gonna come and see us, and you're gonna get to sign your name on the wall.

2205
03:13:30,770 --> 03:13:32,791
CrossFit is family, it is.

2206
03:13:33,411 --> 03:13:35,132
It's one of the side effects, you get in good shape.

2207
03:13:36,287 --> 03:13:39,369
My wife signed me up without me knowing.

2208
03:13:40,630 --> 03:13:44,112
Oh, by the way, you got level one, first of November.

2209
03:13:44,152 --> 03:13:47,073
And I'm like, we got too much going on.

2210
03:13:47,113 --> 03:13:49,955
She's having eye surgery next Wednesday on her back.

2211
03:13:50,155 --> 03:13:51,396
And I'm like, we got too much going on.

2212
03:13:54,150 --> 03:13:56,432
And she says, oh, no, I already paid for it.

2213
03:13:56,452 --> 03:13:57,553
It's not refundable.

2214
03:13:57,573 --> 03:13:58,214
You have to go.

2215
03:13:58,834 --> 03:13:59,175
Okay.

2216
03:13:59,555 --> 03:14:06,161
And then when coach heard, well, this is good, he says, because, you know, you're one of our older participants here, been here forever.

2217
03:14:06,881 --> 03:14:09,944
He says, this will encourage more people to come.

2218
03:14:10,745 --> 03:14:13,848
It'd be nice if everybody in the gym was a level one and then just keep going up.

2219
03:14:15,549 --> 03:14:18,071
I read the bios on our instructors down here last night.

2220
03:14:19,012 --> 03:14:19,693
That's incredible.

2221
03:14:21,175 --> 03:14:21,775
Makes me jealous.

2222
03:14:21,835 --> 03:14:23,176
I wish I was 20 years younger.

2223
03:14:23,316 --> 03:14:25,196
It doesn't matter what you do in life.

2224
03:14:25,396 --> 03:14:25,916
You learn.

2225
03:14:26,896 --> 03:14:33,258
If you go through a day that you do not learn something, I don't care what it is, that day, to me, that day is a waste.

2226
03:14:34,018 --> 03:14:35,479
That is my philosophy of life.

2227
03:14:36,339 --> 03:14:37,999
Every day, you have to learn something.

2228
03:14:39,279 --> 03:14:44,501
I've done automotive repair for 51 years, and I'll have somebody come in and say, well, I did this this way.

2229
03:14:45,981 --> 03:14:47,782
Look, that's a better way to do that.

2230
03:14:48,202 --> 03:14:49,062
You learn something.

2231
03:14:50,593 --> 03:14:55,034
I really liked the way they broke things down down here.

2232
03:14:55,114 --> 03:14:55,954
They break it down.

2233
03:14:56,034 --> 03:15:10,498
Cal is an incredible instructor, but they broke things down even at a greater level.

2234
03:15:12,398 --> 03:15:15,399
But the way they broke things down yesterday, it was very interesting.

2235
03:15:17,320 --> 03:15:18,080
The front squat was

2236
03:15:20,573 --> 03:15:26,116
I have never cleaned a front squat because I have bad shoulders, no rotator cuffs, no bicep tendons.

2237
03:15:26,456 --> 03:15:31,998
A lot of times in a front squat, I'll come off the rack and I'll set it on my shoulders and I can balance.

2238
03:15:32,178 --> 03:15:34,700
I can lift 200 pounds doing a front squat that way.

2239
03:15:35,280 --> 03:15:36,781
I can't do 55 this way.

2240
03:15:37,901 --> 03:15:39,022
But the way they broke it down,

2241
03:15:40,672 --> 03:15:42,233
I was like, man, I could do more.

2242
03:15:42,613 --> 03:15:45,114
I could learn something.

2243
03:15:46,114 --> 03:15:46,854
And that's cool.

2244
03:15:46,874 --> 03:15:49,755
So yeah, I'm not apprehensive anymore.

2245
03:15:50,235 --> 03:15:51,536
Everybody should take this course.

2246
03:15:52,756 --> 03:15:53,797
You'll get something out of it.

2247
03:15:53,837 --> 03:15:55,577
And I sure as hell have.

2248
03:15:55,777 --> 03:15:59,178
My folks made it to their mid-90s and never did nothing.

2249
03:15:59,559 --> 03:16:02,880
When dad was my age, he was on a second pacemaker.

2250
03:16:04,540 --> 03:16:04,900
I'm not.

2251
03:16:05,781 --> 03:16:06,861
I have lung problems.

2252
03:16:07,301 --> 03:16:09,242
I used to smoke when I was young.

2253
03:16:12,327 --> 03:16:14,308
I owned a martial arts school for many years.

2254
03:16:15,109 --> 03:16:16,370
I should have done this instead of that.

2255
03:16:16,450 --> 03:16:23,415
I wouldn't have bad knees, plates in my feet, pins in there, plates in my head.

2256
03:16:24,116 --> 03:16:24,816
I don't need that.

2257
03:16:25,096 --> 03:16:32,782
This is more controlled fitness than going out and say beating the hell out of somebody.

2258
03:16:35,464 --> 03:16:35,964
It was fun.

2259
03:16:36,565 --> 03:16:37,546
This is fun as well.

2260
03:17:05,328 --> 03:17:06,270
You can stay right there.

2261
03:17:47,766 --> 03:17:47,886
so

2262
03:20:13,485 --> 03:20:14,567
world a better place.

2263
03:20:15,369 --> 03:20:16,331
And we use CrossFit.

2264
03:20:16,672 --> 03:20:19,958
What if two days could redefine your health and your life?

2265
03:20:20,767 --> 03:20:23,130
Welcome to your CrossFit Level 1 seminar.

2266
03:20:23,450 --> 03:20:28,655
Our goal is to give you guys a better understanding of our definition of CrossFit.

2267
03:20:28,695 --> 03:20:34,461
When we talk about CrossFit, the definition is constantly varied, functional movements, executed at high intensity.

2268
03:20:35,062 --> 03:20:37,144
Forget fleeting trends and empty promises.

2269
03:20:37,664 --> 03:20:40,928
This isn't a magic pill or a quick fix.

2270
03:20:41,288 --> 03:20:43,971
This is the CrossFit Level 1 course.

2271
03:20:44,251 --> 03:20:46,974
Why don't we take a look at Seth and see if there's things we can address.

2272
03:20:47,194 --> 03:20:57,746
An immersive experience led by passionate, world-class educators, coaches, and trainers, driven to empower you towards a longer, happier, and healthier life.

2273
03:20:58,327 --> 03:21:05,195
What we realize is that true fitness is a compromise of skills, and that's what we're talking about being generally physically prepared for anything.

2274
03:21:05,515 --> 03:21:16,323
Over two transformative days, you'll unlock the power of foundational movements, understand the artistry of effective programming, and grasp the science behind lasting well-being.

2275
03:21:16,623 --> 03:21:23,248
Everybody's journey is different from the CrossFit Games athlete to the person like me who just started CrossFit two weeks ago.

2276
03:21:23,715 --> 03:21:30,117
You'll discover how integrating sound nutrition and movement can be your greatest defense against chronic diseases.

2277
03:21:30,657 --> 03:21:35,678
You'll learn to move with purpose, live with vitality, and truly thrive.

2278
03:21:35,839 --> 03:21:42,921
What distinguishes it from other courses is the fact that people are watching how to make people better.

2279
03:21:43,201 --> 03:21:44,781
This isn't just a fitness course.

2280
03:21:45,061 --> 03:21:47,482
It's an initiation into a life of intentional health.

2281
03:21:47,994 --> 03:21:53,200
It's not even necessarily about where you start or what you do when you start this process.

2282
03:21:53,561 --> 03:21:55,503
It's can you stick to it?

2283
03:21:55,543 --> 03:21:56,624
Can you be consistent?

2284
03:21:56,865 --> 03:22:04,353
Whether you're a seasoned CrossFitter or new to the journey, this course equips you to take command of your fitness and shape a healthier future.

2285
03:22:05,174 --> 03:22:05,755
Own your health.

2286
03:22:06,636 --> 03:22:07,417
We'll show you how.

2287
03:22:15,126 --> 03:22:20,248
Our prescription for wellness in CrossFit is meats and vegetables, nuts and seeds, some fruit, little starch, and no sugar.

2288
03:22:20,589 --> 03:22:24,170
And what that is is a prescription to eat real whole foods.

2289
03:22:24,610 --> 03:22:28,172
At the CrossFit Level 1 course, you won't just learn about moving well.

2290
03:22:28,632 --> 03:22:30,173
You'll learn about living well.

2291
03:22:30,533 --> 03:22:32,914
And living well starts with eating well.

2292
03:22:33,354 --> 03:22:38,737
Because at CrossFit, we believe that nutrition is the foundation to a healthy lifestyle.

2293
03:22:38,877 --> 03:22:42,679
There's this theoretical hierarchy in the development of an athlete that looks like a pyramid.

2294
03:22:42,840 --> 03:22:48,984
At the bottom of it, we've got nutrition, the theoretical hierarchy of the development of an athlete.

2295
03:22:49,124 --> 03:22:54,867
So really, when we think about this in our training, nutrition should be the first thing that we focus on.

2296
03:22:54,988 --> 03:23:03,173
In this course, you'll find inspiration not only to move better, but to fuel better, because you can't outwork a bad diet.

2297
03:23:03,523 --> 03:23:09,951
If your nutrition sucks, these things will not be where they could be if it were more solid.

2298
03:23:10,391 --> 03:23:15,558
How we eat either supports or undermines our fitness over time.

2299
03:23:16,319 --> 03:23:22,406
And all of this will help you own your health, optimize your fitness, and thrive.

2300
03:23:24,786 --> 03:23:28,029
There's a timelessness to the message that's contained in the Level 1s.

2301
03:23:28,169 --> 03:23:31,052
It's the unchanging heart of what CrossFit is.

2302
03:23:31,272 --> 03:23:34,956
They really helped us out and gave us key ingredients to CrossFit.

2303
03:23:35,076 --> 03:23:37,418
The learning progression and all that stuff has really helped me out.

2304
03:23:37,618 --> 03:23:44,965
Since its inception, hundreds of thousands of people have taken the CrossFit Level 1 course all around the world.

2305
03:23:45,185 --> 03:23:45,986
I got what I hoped for.

2306
03:23:46,006 --> 03:23:50,149
I learned the movements, got some techniques corrected, learned some better coaching cues.

2307
03:23:50,249 --> 03:24:00,357
And it will help you in your own individual journey, even if you never want to coach, in knowing really the methodology behind CrossFit and why it's so different than anything else that's out there.

2308
03:24:00,578 --> 03:24:12,747
From teenagers to retirees, from doctors to teachers, coaches to students, the CrossFit Level 1 course changes lives, offering every single person

2309
03:24:13,688 --> 03:24:21,514
regardless of ability level, the opportunity to understand health, nutrition, movement, and CrossFit.

2310
03:24:22,014 --> 03:24:23,355
The best learning experience I've had.

2311
03:24:24,256 --> 03:24:25,617
I really liked the way

2312
03:24:26,504 --> 03:24:27,684
They broke things down.

2313
03:24:27,865 --> 03:24:29,185
Everybody should take this course.

2314
03:24:29,505 --> 03:24:36,828
The way that they taught, it built a desire to really want to be part of something that was bringing that more into other people's everyday life.

2315
03:24:37,028 --> 03:24:46,392
In short, our members have the tools they need to approach their health and fitness more productively, more effectively, and more confidently.

2316
03:24:46,472 --> 03:24:54,955
It's about how we're serving our community and trying to empower them with more skills and tools in order to be able to take this back to their communities.

2317
03:24:56,353 --> 03:24:58,014
It's worth every penny.

2318
03:24:58,114 --> 03:25:00,476
You get so much more out of it than what you paid for it.

2319
03:25:00,636 --> 03:25:07,940
Empowering you with the knowledge, confidence, and tools to live better, healthier lives.

2320
03:25:09,701 --> 03:25:10,342
Own your health.

2321
03:25:11,382 --> 03:25:12,183
We'll show you how.

2322
03:26:15,193 --> 03:26:16,356
Outro Music

2323
03:31:50,495 --> 03:31:50,635
and

2324
03:32:41,914 --> 03:32:43,461
Yeah.

2325
03:42:28,801 --> 03:42:28,922
so

2326
03:48:11,292 --> 03:48:11,332
so

2327
03:57:04,362 --> 03:57:23,593
Saturday continues here at the 2025 CrossFit Games, but on Wednesday and Thursday of this week, we had the first ever coaches and owners conference presented by HustleUp, where owners and coaches all around the world descended on Albany, New York, and the best minds in the business came together

2328
03:57:24,473 --> 03:57:37,157
to create better coaches, better business owners, and better CrossFit affiliates for the most important thing we have in this community, and that is our CrossFit affiliates all around the world.

2329
03:57:39,697 --> 03:57:41,458
And inside the MVP arena,

2330
03:57:42,712 --> 03:57:47,096
We have the racks as we are going to get set to go heavy.

2331
03:57:47,696 --> 03:57:48,577
I'm Chase Ingram.

2332
03:57:49,057 --> 03:57:50,718
Along with me is Adrian Conway.

2333
03:57:51,419 --> 03:57:54,381
Mike Arsenault will be joining us on the floor shortly.

2334
03:57:54,521 --> 03:57:58,965
And we have our heavy test today.

2335
03:58:00,326 --> 03:58:03,889
One rep max back squat presented by Lu Xiaojun.

2336
03:58:09,155 --> 03:58:10,737
Hey, man, this looks straightforward, brother.

2337
03:58:11,678 --> 03:58:13,239
They're going to give you a one-rep max.

2338
03:58:13,520 --> 03:58:18,105
And the secret to this is to make sure that you know your squat.

2339
03:58:18,665 --> 03:58:22,269
So you're going to make sure that you have an idea of where you want to place the bar on your back.

2340
03:58:22,289 --> 03:58:25,312
We're going to see some high-bar back squats, some low-bar back squats.

2341
03:58:25,613 --> 03:58:30,938
And then, of course, you want to start sharp, not slow, which means that you're going to get three lifts.

2342
03:58:31,619 --> 03:58:35,682
If you start out sticky and slow, you're not going to prime yourself for the heavy lifts later.

2343
03:58:35,862 --> 03:58:37,603
And that's where they're going to maximize your points.

2344
03:58:37,784 --> 03:58:42,367
Now, we've seen a heavy squat at the games in the past of the CrossFit total.

2345
03:58:42,407 --> 03:58:47,631
But what we have not seen are these new safety squat racks from Row Fitness.

2346
03:58:47,711 --> 03:58:49,232
And more on that, let's go down to Mike Arsenault.

2347
03:58:49,252 --> 03:58:49,772
That's right, Chase.

2348
03:58:49,792 --> 03:58:56,798
We're going to be dealing with some maximal weights for these guys with this back squat event as Peter Ellis just sets up his bar for his first attempt.

2349
03:58:57,058 --> 03:58:59,740
So we have these safety racks and safety straps.

2350
03:58:59,760 --> 03:59:02,582
So these safety straps were measured earlier in the week for each athlete.

2351
03:59:02,902 --> 03:59:07,926
So they're all different for each athlete to ensure the athletes can get below parallel for a clean rep.

2352
03:59:07,946 --> 03:59:11,028
But if they have to bail out, they will be protected by these straps.

2353
03:59:11,288 --> 03:59:17,173
And the athletes are allowed to adjust their J hooks as well to get to a comfortable position before they make each attempt.

2354
03:59:23,288 --> 03:59:23,969
Thank you, Mike.

2355
03:59:24,209 --> 03:59:26,771
Your lane assignments for heat number one.

2356
03:59:26,791 --> 03:59:30,914
We're back to three heats of 10, as we'll start off with the men.

2357
03:59:33,055 --> 03:59:35,938
Some heavy lifts, at least listed lifts.

2358
03:59:37,117 --> 03:59:40,378
In this heat, in our Vision Fuels Victory, athletes.

2359
03:59:40,898 --> 03:59:42,419
Lane number two, Morris Feibig.

2360
03:59:43,099 --> 03:59:48,601
Morris Feibig, an athlete with a listed back squat of 485, at least as a previous best.

2361
03:59:48,641 --> 03:59:51,382
Now, we're using this data as a reference point, of course.

2362
03:59:52,002 --> 03:59:53,022
This is why we play the game.

2363
03:59:53,062 --> 03:59:54,223
The numbers don't matter as much.

2364
03:59:54,243 --> 03:59:55,663
You've got to see what you can do on game day.

2365
03:59:55,943 --> 03:59:59,344
And Jorge Fernandez, who has a listed max of 495.

2366
03:59:59,884 --> 04:00:04,426
The question is, will we see 500 pounds this weekend?

2367
04:00:06,778 --> 04:00:07,858
Enrique Morieta.

2368
04:00:09,819 --> 04:00:11,259
The attempt will be on the right.

2369
04:00:11,279 --> 04:00:15,440
If you look at the bottom part of the lane, 445 to open things up.

2370
04:00:18,881 --> 04:00:20,162
Very nice there by Morieta.

2371
04:00:20,442 --> 04:00:23,883
More vertical in his squat position, choosing the high bar method.

2372
04:00:24,123 --> 04:00:31,825
And one thing I want to keep an eye on the next time Morieta comes back up is that he tapped the straps at the bottom of his squat.

2373
04:00:33,278 --> 04:00:35,400
Moritz, they listed Max.

2374
04:00:35,440 --> 04:00:37,102
Again, these are listed Max we have.

2375
04:00:37,122 --> 04:00:44,150
A lot of these athletes like to play a little coy, a little cat and mouse with what they put out as far as what we can see.

2376
04:00:46,692 --> 04:00:49,595
We're seeing some smooth as butter lift attempts going on right now.

2377
04:00:49,615 --> 04:00:55,642
You'll notice a lot of these athletes just trying to prime their central nervous system, familiarize themselves with the load on the platform.

2378
04:00:58,335 --> 04:01:00,997
And then we'll see some weight start to go up in these second and third attempts.

2379
04:01:01,358 --> 04:01:03,500
Toby Buckland at 445.

2380
04:01:06,042 --> 04:01:10,966
Buckland does not have a listed max, says Bronislav Lankovic.

2381
04:01:14,529 --> 04:01:16,951
Bron very intentional with setting his hips down and back.

2382
04:01:17,031 --> 04:01:18,452
Really great squat mechanics there.

2383
04:01:19,313 --> 04:01:23,056
He's setting himself up for some success with those later lifts, the way he mechanically executed there.

2384
04:01:23,076 --> 04:01:26,019
430-pound attempt for Peter Ellis.

2385
04:01:37,245 --> 04:01:38,406
You'll notice the signal go out.

2386
04:01:38,446 --> 04:01:40,328
The hand comes forward as a good lift.

2387
04:01:40,448 --> 04:01:45,793
Judges are looking for that the hip crease lowers clearly below the top of the knee.

2388
04:01:46,453 --> 04:01:51,778
It was very clear in the standards the athletes have to go below, not too parallel, in order to have a successful lift.

2389
04:01:52,599 --> 04:01:57,063
Yonakoski competing in his 10th CrossFit Games this weekend.

2390
04:02:01,608 --> 04:02:10,437
Now, as far as the lift itself, it just must start before that 20-second time frame is up.

2391
04:02:11,177 --> 04:02:18,725
Diego Lucis, we've got a last-minute invite with a backfill from the far east throwdown.

2392
04:02:22,005 --> 04:02:23,807
475 open here for Jorge Fernandez.

2393
04:02:23,827 --> 04:02:26,270
Are you surprised to see some of these opening weights that we've seen?

2394
04:02:26,530 --> 04:02:27,831
This one right here surprises me.

2395
04:02:27,892 --> 04:02:31,195
Now, we're hopeful to see well over 500 pounds for Jorge.

2396
04:02:31,416 --> 04:02:37,903
But opening at 475 is a huge load of confidence, no pun intended, for him to hit that smooth.

2397
04:02:39,604 --> 04:02:41,965
475 is good for Jorge Fernandez.

2398
04:02:42,005 --> 04:02:47,167
That is the heaviest weight we've seen put on the bar as Bill Leahy opens up with 435.

2399
04:02:48,187 --> 04:02:51,328
Leahy has a listed max at 480.

2400
04:02:52,428 --> 04:02:54,989
And that looks like no issue whatsoever.

2401
04:02:55,009 --> 04:02:58,230
Tremendous speed going to the down and up there for Bill.

2402
04:02:59,177 --> 04:03:06,242
A lot of times, you want to control the initial portion of the descend and then use the stretch reflex, which means a little bit of that bounce out of the bottom of the squat.

2403
04:03:06,542 --> 04:03:08,404
435 attempt again for Isaac Newman.

2404
04:03:08,424 --> 04:03:11,206
He will be your last lifter in this first heat.

2405
04:03:12,507 --> 04:03:16,770
As he lifts a max of 485, that rep is good as the round one is done.

2406
04:03:16,790 --> 04:03:20,553
And we'll go back to Enrique Morera.

2407
04:03:22,258 --> 04:03:29,152
Question is, is how's that depth going to fare with the straps that he chose to have set?

2408
04:03:29,352 --> 04:03:30,875
And he's got to get out of the rack cleanly.

2409
04:03:30,915 --> 04:03:33,079
Yeah, he has a little almost like a stumble coming back.

2410
04:03:40,689 --> 04:03:43,412
Good lift, and clearly they made the appropriate adjustment in the bottom.

2411
04:03:43,493 --> 04:03:48,158
And not uncommon, we've seen, when you are warming up in the back area, now you're being corralled.

2412
04:03:48,258 --> 04:03:53,565
A lot of times, the first round of any lift that we do seems to be the shakier, worse round.

2413
04:03:53,885 --> 04:03:55,688
And in the second round, you see some clean lifts.

2414
04:03:59,237 --> 04:04:01,699
And what we're seeing is the adaptation of the central nervous system.

2415
04:04:01,719 --> 04:04:05,582
These athletes now mechanically are more comfortable and confident on the floor.

2416
04:04:05,662 --> 04:04:07,904
Now it's time to get competition mode.

2417
04:04:08,264 --> 04:04:11,086
Fiebig just hit 485 as Buckland gets set.

2418
04:04:11,206 --> 04:04:13,388
Fiebig's listed max.

2419
04:04:13,428 --> 04:04:19,612
So some of these numbers we have might not be the same once we leave this event as Buckland will hit.

2420
04:04:23,515 --> 04:04:25,537
Next is Bronislav Lankovic's attempt is at 470.

2421
04:04:28,732 --> 04:04:30,452
His list is max is 441, so.

2422
04:04:30,672 --> 04:04:36,134
And Adrian, as you said, as he sets the hip back.

2423
04:04:36,554 --> 04:04:41,235
Another reason, another thing in setting his back is he's not tilting his pelvis to do it.

2424
04:04:41,715 --> 04:04:45,236
He's sitting the hips back while keeping that low back intact.

2425
04:04:45,256 --> 04:04:45,636
That's right.

2426
04:04:45,656 --> 04:04:46,656
Yeah, he's doing a great job of it.

2427
04:04:46,676 --> 04:04:51,657
It's a very traditional, more so into a power lifting versus an Olympic weightlifting style of squat.

2428
04:04:51,677 --> 04:04:56,078
But it's paying off right now for Big Braun.

2429
04:04:57,148 --> 04:04:59,010
Ellis, smooth for Peter Ellis.

2430
04:05:00,232 --> 04:05:00,712
Temp good at 440.

2431
04:05:00,812 --> 04:05:01,573
Iwonakoski.

2432
04:05:01,593 --> 04:05:03,235
450 on the bar for Koski.

2433
04:05:20,142 --> 04:05:23,163
Oh, yeah, great job there by Yona to drive through the middle.

2434
04:05:23,363 --> 04:05:24,263
That's the tricky part.

2435
04:05:24,283 --> 04:05:26,604
The squat's going to start to slow when you're at your threshold.

2436
04:05:26,864 --> 04:05:31,885
That's a vet move by Yona to force his hips forward and keep it under the barbell.

2437
04:05:32,206 --> 04:05:31,885
445.

2438
04:05:32,646 --> 04:05:35,647
And that'll be the first bell we see.

2439
04:05:35,667 --> 04:05:39,408
And you can see why we are squatting out of that safety rack.

2440
04:05:39,428 --> 04:05:43,349
Now, the athletes will have to break their bar down and set up themselves.

2441
04:05:43,389 --> 04:05:46,270
They'll have plenty of time as Fernandez sets up for 490.

2442
04:05:49,285 --> 04:05:50,625
Opened up with 475.

2443
04:05:51,066 --> 04:05:53,286
Now, Jorge was pretty quick there.

2444
04:05:53,346 --> 04:05:55,307
Have some patience on the way down here, Jorge.

2445
04:05:57,567 --> 04:06:01,048
Good timing.

2446
04:06:01,068 --> 04:06:05,670
10 pounds away from potentially our first 500-pound squat for the day.

2447
04:06:07,690 --> 04:06:09,371
Leahy hit 435, now attempting 470.

2448
04:06:18,312 --> 04:06:21,112
Good lift there for Leahy.

2449
04:06:21,132 --> 04:06:22,173
460 on the bar for Newman.

2450
04:06:36,075 --> 04:06:38,256
Newman with a very vertical torso through his squat.

2451
04:06:38,276 --> 04:06:39,856
He's got a long torso.

2452
04:06:39,876 --> 04:06:44,057
Really helps him keep his hips directly underneath his shoulders throughout the full range there.

2453
04:06:44,417 --> 04:06:45,337
It's impressive.

2454
04:06:45,357 --> 04:06:46,257
480 for Enrique.

2455
04:06:47,374 --> 04:06:49,155
This is his third and final attempt.

2456
04:06:52,336 --> 04:06:54,517
This event is sponsored by Liu Zhangjun.

2457
04:06:55,918 --> 04:07:03,821
That is the shoe that Enrique is wearing, and it pays off.

2458
04:07:04,141 --> 04:07:08,583
And that, my friend, is the heat of competition and the crowd coming to life.

2459
04:07:09,384 --> 04:07:11,285
Uh-oh, 530 on the bar.

2460
04:07:11,305 --> 04:07:16,267
50-pound jump for Moritz Fiebig.

2461
04:07:18,050 --> 04:07:18,671
Oh, kicks!

2462
04:07:21,813 --> 04:07:22,694
What a jump.

2463
04:07:22,994 --> 04:07:23,654
What a jump.

2464
04:07:23,674 --> 04:07:27,497
That's a big jump that he took from round one to round two.

2465
04:07:27,537 --> 04:07:29,418
Hey, that's what we came to see, though.

2466
04:07:29,919 --> 04:07:30,739
You'd love to see it.

2467
04:07:31,760 --> 04:07:32,460
You'd love to see it.

2468
04:07:32,480 --> 04:07:34,962
485 for Toby Buckland.

2469
04:07:39,349 --> 04:07:42,811
Now, Liu Zhangjun is not just the shoe or the name brand.

2470
04:07:42,851 --> 04:07:48,315
That is the name of one of the best Olympic athletes to ever compete in the sport.

2471
04:07:49,035 --> 04:07:50,256
And there's a bit more on the line.

2472
04:07:50,296 --> 04:07:54,178
If you use the shoes, the athletes will get 500.

2473
04:07:54,398 --> 04:07:57,000
If you win the event, you get another 3,000.

2474
04:07:58,781 --> 04:07:59,361
There it is.

2475
04:07:59,381 --> 04:08:01,803
Five hundo for Big Braun.

2476
04:08:01,823 --> 04:08:06,526
And score, one on the board for Bratislava Leikowitz.

2477
04:08:10,382 --> 04:08:11,203
500 pounds.

2478
04:08:12,444 --> 04:08:15,006
Peter Ellis, he'll get his lift.

2479
04:08:17,488 --> 04:08:18,829
Great clean lift there by Ellis.

2480
04:08:18,889 --> 04:08:20,651
Very structured and strategic there.

2481
04:08:21,512 --> 04:08:22,072
Still smooth.

2482
04:08:22,092 --> 04:08:27,857
He had plenty in the tank.

2483
04:08:28,217 --> 04:08:32,621
465 attempt for Yonakoski's third and final lift.

2484
04:08:33,242 --> 04:08:36,905
Now right out of the bottom, he's got to start to drive his hips forward as he presses through the bar.

2485
04:08:41,621 --> 04:08:43,242
Not in time, not in time.

2486
04:08:55,385 --> 04:08:56,786
Lift is good for Tiago.

2487
04:08:56,806 --> 04:09:08,630
5.05, and this will be for the event lead for Jorge Fernandez.

2488
04:09:10,690 --> 04:09:11,551
He went 475, 490.

2489
04:09:13,453 --> 04:09:14,774
Can he get another 15 here?

2490
04:09:14,794 --> 04:09:24,442
Aiden, do you feel like he got a little shy at the very bottom, not bouncing out like he did for the 490?

2491
04:09:24,482 --> 04:09:25,002
A little shy.

2492
04:09:25,022 --> 04:09:27,685
Yeah, you really got to fight to maximize that stretch reflex, Chase.

2493
04:09:27,725 --> 04:09:31,548
You want to use muscle, but if you can get some assistance from the joints and tendons,

2494
04:09:33,295 --> 04:09:53,140
just like bill leahy did right there on that repetition it goes a long way 485 is good for bill leahy that's good enough for a third in the heat tied three ways with toby bucklin and moritz fiebig newman watch how tall look at how tall he keeps his chest

2495
04:09:56,101 --> 04:09:58,542
And that is one of the hardest aspects.

2496
04:09:58,562 --> 04:10:04,165
When you can have the unique ability to stay vertical through a squat, you've got to brace tremendously firm.

2497
04:10:04,185 --> 04:10:06,426
You've got to rely on that belt, press your belly into that belt.

2498
04:10:07,087 --> 04:10:08,467
And Newman just came up just shy.

2499
04:10:08,808 --> 04:10:10,248
The question is, would we see it?

2500
04:10:10,288 --> 04:10:12,289
And now it'll be, how many will we see?

2501
04:10:12,349 --> 04:10:17,132
But Bronislav Olegovic hits the first 500 back squat of the afternoon.

2502
04:10:28,770 --> 04:10:35,575
Our top three lifts, 485, 490, and 500.

2503
04:10:36,356 --> 04:10:41,059
The replay is presented by Rogue Fitness.

2504
04:10:41,319 --> 04:10:43,941
Well, we talked about different variations of squatting.

2505
04:10:44,362 --> 04:10:48,345
Fiebig, one of the athletes that really gets the bar pretty low on his traps, sends his hips back.

2506
04:10:48,805 --> 04:10:52,548
But man, it was clean speed out of the bottom for his lift attempts.

2507
04:10:53,536 --> 04:10:55,118
And then it was Jorge Fernandez.

2508
04:10:55,178 --> 04:11:00,525
We would go on to see him attempt a lift over 505, but this is where he hit his sweet spot.

2509
04:11:01,386 --> 04:11:06,113
Finding that timing, and Chase, you alluded to it, really maximizing the stretch reflex out of the bottom.

2510
04:11:06,133 --> 04:11:08,135
It helps him have more speed out of the hole there.

2511
04:11:09,443 --> 04:11:11,604
And then, of course, it was big Ron Alinkiewicz here.

2512
04:11:12,525 --> 04:11:17,187
A little bit of a wider setup, feet just outside of hip width, strong brace, hips down and back.

2513
04:11:17,507 --> 04:11:23,710
And then it was textbook squatting as he drove through the bar and gave us that victorious scream for the win.

2514
04:11:23,850 --> 04:11:24,871
Your heat results.

2515
04:11:26,048 --> 04:11:34,856
Big brawn, first 500-pound back squat on the board, Jorge Fernandez in second in the heat, followed by a three-way tie.

2516
04:11:35,357 --> 04:11:40,702
Now, the tiebreakers will be your previous successful back squats.

2517
04:11:40,922 --> 04:11:44,845
So as we get further down the line, those second lists will come into play.

2518
04:11:46,467 --> 04:11:51,732
The second heat of men will be coming up next to take on the one-rep max back squat.

2519
04:12:12,793 --> 04:12:15,515
One heat down, two heats left to go in this second heat.

2520
04:12:16,155 --> 04:12:23,800
Do not go anywhere, because some of the heaviest back squatters we have in the business are about to take the floor.

2521
04:12:23,880 --> 04:12:24,721
I'm Chase Ingram.

2522
04:12:24,761 --> 04:12:26,462
Along with me is Adrian Conway.

2523
04:12:27,202 --> 04:12:29,604
Mike Arsenault will join us on the floor shortly.

2524
04:12:31,465 --> 04:12:35,266
It's the One Rev Max Back Squat, presented by Lu Zhongjun.

2525
04:12:35,966 --> 04:12:37,987
And Adrian, we've got to see one heat down.

2526
04:12:38,007 --> 04:12:41,428
It goes pretty quick, so you've got to be dialed in and ready to go.

2527
04:12:41,448 --> 04:12:44,269
What are your tempo recipe for success?

2528
04:12:44,749 --> 04:12:46,829
Well, these athletes are going to get 20 seconds each.

2529
04:12:46,849 --> 04:12:50,790
They're going to rotate through three rounds, so they're going to get three attempts.

2530
04:12:51,330 --> 04:12:53,931
You've got to know your squat, and you've got to start sharp, Chase.

2531
04:12:54,231 --> 04:12:56,272
You're laying assignments for heat number two.

2532
04:12:57,612 --> 04:13:07,215
The top three heaviest squats in the biz are in this lane between Hatfield, Nick Matthew, and Colton Mertens.

2533
04:13:07,255 --> 04:13:09,076
So Mertens will be kicking things off.

2534
04:13:09,116 --> 04:13:10,857
He'll be over in lane number one.

2535
04:13:10,877 --> 04:13:13,798
For more on Mertens, let's go down to Mike Arsenault.

2536
04:13:14,378 --> 04:13:18,160
Well, Chase, we just saw the heaviest weight lifted in heat number one was 500 pounds.

2537
04:13:18,200 --> 04:13:18,740
Well, guess what?

2538
04:13:19,060 --> 04:13:22,221
Colton Mertens has already eclipsed that in the warm-up area.

2539
04:13:22,281 --> 04:13:25,622
I saw him hit 515, and it looked like an air squat.

2540
04:13:25,923 --> 04:13:30,824
So the amount of weight that's going to be lifted by these guys in heat number two is really going to be impressive.

2541
04:13:31,105 --> 04:13:35,066
Will we see a number from this heat that begins with a six?

2542
04:13:35,446 --> 04:13:36,347
Remains to be seen.

2543
04:13:36,427 --> 04:13:36,947
I can't wait.

2544
04:13:39,927 --> 04:13:40,587
I mean, we might see it.

2545
04:13:40,607 --> 04:13:43,209
Hey, look, I'm not going to argue against that.

2546
04:13:43,249 --> 04:13:47,951
And Colton Mertens needs to be one of those guys with an opportunity there.

2547
04:13:47,971 --> 04:13:52,354
We mentioned earlier that this event is sponsored by Lu Zhong Jun.

2548
04:13:52,374 --> 04:13:58,497
That is the weightlifting shoe that is on the feet of several athletes, including Colton Mertens.

2549
04:13:58,577 --> 04:14:02,759
And they're giving away $3,000 for event wins during the games.

2550
04:14:02,819 --> 04:14:05,540
They're giving away an additional $3,000 if you win wearing the shoes.

2551
04:14:09,168 --> 04:14:15,369
Nick Matthew, that guy has squatted 500 pounds a couple times in a row himself.

2552
04:14:16,390 --> 04:14:18,250
And guy, I thought he was done loading plates.

2553
04:14:18,710 --> 04:14:20,151
Yeah, nah, nah, nah, nah.

2554
04:14:20,191 --> 04:14:22,191
Not when you've got a listed max on our profile at 545.

2555
04:14:22,351 --> 04:14:29,453
It's like, yeah, yeah, I'm going to keep loading this bar until I look around and see that I've outloaded everyone else at this point.

2556
04:14:29,533 --> 04:14:33,354
And the man who has the best advantage to be looking around is in lane number 10.

2557
04:14:33,714 --> 04:14:37,835
That is Austin Hatfield, who will be the last lifter in line

2558
04:14:38,395 --> 04:14:39,316
for heat number two.

2559
04:14:39,336 --> 04:14:42,721
And we just saw him put up 505 for a double a couple of weeks ago.

2560
04:14:42,801 --> 04:14:43,142
That's right.

2561
04:14:43,162 --> 04:14:48,249
And if you pay any attention, you know, and people have been talking about this, we see what Hatfield had even been training with.

2562
04:14:48,509 --> 04:14:55,639
If you're hitting working sets of 505 for a double in training, wow, that gives you a lot of upside and potential for what you're going to hit on the competition floor.

2563
04:14:59,144 --> 04:15:08,875
Opening at 535 pounds, Colton Mertens is going to try to kick this max lift off of the bank.

2564
04:15:20,032 --> 04:15:20,573
Okay.

2565
04:15:20,753 --> 04:15:21,534
Oh, my God.

2566
04:15:21,634 --> 04:15:23,576
I thought Mike Arsenault was being ridiculous.

2567
04:15:23,596 --> 04:15:25,337
I thought Mike was being sarcastic.

2568
04:15:25,377 --> 04:15:26,518
Yeah, could we see a six?

2569
04:15:26,558 --> 04:15:30,261
I'm like, yeah, maybe in the middle of the three numbers, but not the first one.

2570
04:15:30,842 --> 04:15:34,705
Not to mention Mr. Captain Jack Rosema opening at 500 pounds also.

2571
04:15:34,725 --> 04:15:35,987
Oh, come on.

2572
04:15:36,107 --> 04:15:36,747
Okay.

2573
04:15:37,448 --> 04:15:43,113
I'm starting to get some 2021 Mac heavy snatch 300-pound vibes here.

2574
04:15:43,453 --> 04:15:45,535
Three back-to-back attempts at 500-plus.

2575
04:15:49,827 --> 04:15:51,589
wow 5 15 what is happening

2576
04:16:00,112 --> 04:16:02,633
I was like, Colin, I'm sorry you have to go after those three.

2577
04:16:02,693 --> 04:16:05,255
It's like going after the smart kids in a class project.

2578
04:16:05,335 --> 04:16:07,096
I'm like, can I have just gone first, please?

2579
04:16:07,116 --> 04:16:07,556
That's right.

2580
04:16:07,816 --> 04:16:09,397
Boss Hart, handle your business, though.

2581
04:16:10,037 --> 04:16:11,878
420 is still wildly impressive.

2582
04:16:11,938 --> 04:16:12,418
That's right it is.

2583
04:16:12,438 --> 04:16:12,719
Keep it up.

2584
04:16:12,759 --> 04:16:13,379
Yeah, keep it up.

2585
04:16:14,199 --> 04:16:16,881
And the battle is for overall points, and we can't ever forget that.

2586
04:16:16,901 --> 04:16:25,025
These guys are trying to concern themselves with their best overall placement, regardless of what all these other behemoths are out there putting on the barbell.

2587
04:16:25,565 --> 04:16:28,827
And Rico Zanoni settling up for his first attempt.

2588
04:16:36,071 --> 04:16:37,313
Great lift there for Enrico.

2589
04:16:37,693 --> 04:16:43,841
Great job bracing and staying firm throughout that squat.

2590
04:16:43,861 --> 04:16:45,463
425 opening lift for Callum Clements.

2591
04:16:47,955 --> 04:16:50,177
A little bit more of a low bar back squat here for Clemens.

2592
04:16:50,277 --> 04:16:51,057
Low on his traps.

2593
04:16:51,077 --> 04:16:52,599
His bum's going to go further back.

2594
04:16:52,999 --> 04:16:54,040
Chest will drop forward.

2595
04:16:54,500 --> 04:16:55,741
Still clean execution.

2596
04:16:55,761 --> 04:17:00,284
Again, this is all about the athletes knowing their style of squat that maximizes their output.

2597
04:17:01,025 --> 04:17:04,708
Just mentioned low bar as Ty Jenkins settles in for 450.

2598
04:17:04,788 --> 04:17:07,550
What's the advantage or disadvantage there between high bar and low bar?

2599
04:17:07,770 --> 04:17:11,894
Often we see athletes with a little bit of a shorter trunk, longer legs go low bar.

2600
04:17:11,934 --> 04:17:13,976
It's going to help them minimize the distance traveled.

2601
04:17:14,416 --> 04:17:18,259
Put more of the strain chase on the back side of your body, a little less on the front side of your body.

2602
04:17:20,001 --> 04:17:23,164
Tile hit 450 as Chris Ibarra settles in for 430.

2603
04:17:33,346 --> 04:17:34,727
That's good for Chris Ibarra.

2604
04:17:35,588 --> 04:17:38,510
Do not be confused by the numbers you see at the top of your screen.

2605
04:17:38,550 --> 04:17:43,353
This is still the first round of three in this Max MaxSquad event.

2606
04:17:45,014 --> 04:17:47,776
Magda, a young athlete with also a big one rep max lift.

2607
04:17:47,816 --> 04:17:52,660
We hadn't seen him hit a max in many years, but he knows he's going to prime himself for something heavy today.

2608
04:17:52,820 --> 04:17:57,964
Also rocking that thick leather weight belt that usually are reserved for

2609
04:17:59,748 --> 04:18:04,843
powerlifting gyms as Austin Hatfield puts on 500 for his first attempt.

2610
04:18:12,483 --> 04:18:15,924
And it's good for Hatfield.

2611
04:18:15,944 --> 04:18:29,488
Four 500-pound back squats in the first round as Mertens loads up 555, which is, as far as we know, the heaviest lift he's ever done for one.

2612
04:18:29,508 --> 04:18:32,969
It's gonna take a second to brace.

2613
04:18:33,129 --> 04:18:34,029
Big deep breath here.

2614
04:18:42,473 --> 04:18:44,035
5.55 is good for Mertens.

2615
04:18:46,059 --> 04:18:49,104
Jack Rosema was laughing as he strapped up his belt.

2616
04:18:49,124 --> 04:18:51,828
5.15 for Jack Rosema.

2617
04:18:58,132 --> 04:18:58,913
That'll fight, finish.

2618
04:18:59,453 --> 04:19:00,934
Nice job there by Jack.

2619
04:19:01,154 --> 04:19:01,555
Wow.

2620
04:19:01,935 --> 04:19:04,557
What a fight there to fight to get his hips under the load.

2621
04:19:04,797 --> 04:19:07,259
And again, that's what we're going to see, folks, as we watch these athletes struggle.

2622
04:19:07,279 --> 04:19:09,841
They got to get their hips forward in order to avoid failing.

2623
04:19:10,282 --> 04:19:11,262
Nick Matthews with 535.

2624
04:19:11,302 --> 04:19:11,743
435 to the bar.

2625
04:19:22,432 --> 04:19:23,633
They've run six miles.

2626
04:19:23,673 --> 04:19:25,254
They've done 60 deadlifts at 350.

2627
04:19:25,515 --> 04:19:29,478
I mean, these guys, what they're showing is phenomenal.

2628
04:19:33,921 --> 04:19:38,986
Enrico Zanoni waiting for his turn as Boszhard gets his second lift.

2629
04:19:39,006 --> 04:19:44,070
435 for Zanoni.

2630
04:19:58,376 --> 04:20:02,057
You even noticed a bit of a hip shift to the right there from Zanoni.

2631
04:20:02,918 --> 04:20:04,478
Could be bothered by something on his left.

2632
04:20:04,498 --> 04:20:06,199
Could have a natural imbalance of weakness.

2633
04:20:06,259 --> 04:20:09,860
If you're training an affiliate and go through a heavy day, sometimes you notice that about your own movement.

2634
04:20:10,581 --> 04:20:12,781
Got to stay square in order to win under those heavy loads.

2635
04:20:13,482 --> 04:20:14,082
Clemens got 425.

2636
04:20:14,162 --> 04:20:15,302
This attempt is 20 pounds more at 45.

2637
04:20:15,442 --> 04:20:16,063
And it'll count.

2638
04:20:23,618 --> 04:20:26,961
He was feeling good about that when he gave us that extra pause and grimace at the top.

2639
04:20:26,981 --> 04:20:29,683
Ty Jenkins going for 470.

2640
04:20:29,783 --> 04:20:37,330
Jenkins will not get that.

2641
04:20:39,912 --> 04:20:43,635
Chris Ibarra loading up for 450.

2642
04:20:43,675 --> 04:20:51,082
Based on what we saw from Ibarra, this is a solid jump, but 20 pounds was doable with his bar speed.

2643
04:20:53,723 --> 04:20:54,723
Got to get forward.

2644
04:20:56,464 --> 04:20:59,125
And this is where you start to wonder, Chase, is this the accumulation effect?

2645
04:20:59,165 --> 04:21:04,807
Are these guys overshooting themselves in their second lift because they feel good, but then they realize that fatigue is starting to catch up?

2646
04:21:04,887 --> 04:21:07,028
Tudor Magnus jumping 30 pounds from 460.

2647
04:21:07,168 --> 04:21:08,529
This attempt is for 490.

2648
04:21:08,729 --> 04:21:16,291
Austin Hadfield has made a 25-pound jump.

2649
04:21:20,695 --> 04:21:20,895
from 500 to 525.

2650
04:21:21,155 --> 04:21:28,579
As Austin Hatfield might say himself, if you ain't first, you're last.

2651
04:21:28,619 --> 04:21:30,220
That's his mindset going into a lot of these.

2652
04:21:32,541 --> 04:21:33,082
Not today.

2653
04:21:35,043 --> 04:21:41,266
Now a decision to make for Austin Hatfield as Colton Mertens is putting on 575.

2654
04:21:41,486 --> 04:21:43,788
I was waiting to see 575, to be honest.

2655
04:21:44,108 --> 04:21:46,109
With the way that moved, I'm not surprised.

2656
04:21:47,410 --> 04:21:47,990
Let's get it.

2657
04:22:00,092 --> 04:22:03,053
And the Iron Hog smashes 570 pounds.

2658
04:22:03,073 --> 04:22:06,933
Great shot of his coach there.

2659
04:22:12,994 --> 04:22:13,915
Rolls him up for 520.

2660
04:22:13,955 --> 04:22:25,017
555 for Nick Matthew.

2661
04:22:34,470 --> 04:22:35,150
He got it.

2662
04:22:37,971 --> 04:22:39,332
Great lift there by Nick.

2663
04:22:39,772 --> 04:22:40,792
Way to stay the course.

2664
04:22:40,812 --> 04:22:45,354
When the bar starts to slow that much, it's very easy to want to just back away and let it go.

2665
04:22:46,134 --> 04:22:48,255
He fought through and got a huge lift there at 555.

2666
04:22:48,295 --> 04:22:48,975
Boss Hart up for 465.

2667
04:22:49,015 --> 04:22:49,496
3, 2, 1, lift.

2668
04:23:03,163 --> 04:23:06,707
Rico Zanoni going for 440, missed his previous attempt.

2669
04:23:10,330 --> 04:23:12,112
Zanoni's got to stay firm out of the hole.

2670
04:23:12,192 --> 04:23:13,794
He gets a good bounce, got to keep it.

2671
04:23:16,036 --> 04:23:21,742
Still has his successful first lift.

2672
04:23:21,762 --> 04:23:24,064
10-pound increase for Callum Clements.

2673
04:23:26,056 --> 04:23:28,377
455.

2674
04:23:26,276 --> 04:23:28,377
This lift, if he wants to make it, it's going to take some time.

2675
04:23:28,458 --> 04:23:29,558
He's got to be willing to fight.

2676
04:23:29,618 --> 04:23:32,841
He's got this low bar approach where his hips are back, less forward.

2677
04:23:33,401 --> 04:23:36,223
And so he's going to use a little bit more musculature to stand it up.

2678
04:23:36,243 --> 04:23:36,824
He's got to fight.

2679
04:23:36,844 --> 04:23:37,404
He does.

2680
04:23:37,905 --> 04:23:38,445
Wow.

2681
04:23:39,466 --> 04:23:42,168
And Clemens is happy about that one.

2682
04:23:42,868 --> 04:23:47,472
Now, Ty went for 470, has now dropped down to 460.

2683
04:23:49,733 --> 04:23:51,575
Previous best was 450.

2684
04:23:52,736 --> 04:23:54,257
And the extra 10 pounds are good.

2685
04:23:56,665 --> 04:23:58,685
Great execution there by the rookie.

2686
04:24:01,726 --> 04:24:04,147
Another 450 attempt for Ibarra.

2687
04:24:05,127 --> 04:24:08,048
Missed his first shot on the second round.

2688
04:24:08,068 --> 04:24:18,590
450 is good.

2689
04:24:20,603 --> 04:24:22,305
Nice job there by Ibarra.

2690
04:24:22,545 --> 04:24:22,705
Oops.

2691
04:24:33,282 --> 04:24:37,486
Gosh, I'd like to see Tudor slow down his tempo a little bit on the way down, right?

2692
04:24:37,546 --> 04:24:42,550
And there's a part of this where you have to balance chase and training, the practice of maxing out.

2693
04:24:42,790 --> 04:24:45,452
It's a valid skill that has to be exercised.

2694
04:24:46,073 --> 04:24:47,134
Austin Hatfield going for 515.

2695
04:24:47,574 --> 04:24:50,877
He missed 525 on his second attempt.

2696
04:24:50,897 --> 04:24:56,622
515 is good and good enough.

2697
04:24:59,530 --> 04:25:00,370
That'll be a separator.

2698
04:25:00,390 --> 04:25:03,332
That's a mature decision there when you're maxing out.

2699
04:25:03,372 --> 04:25:10,195
Could have easily gone for another one right there at that opening lift or that second attempt, but I like that choice.

2700
04:25:10,215 --> 04:25:23,322
570 is the new weight to beat, and that's just a lot of... 555 for Nick Matthew in this back squat.

2701
04:25:23,482 --> 04:25:27,084
We knew it was gonna take some fight, and he gave us every ounce of that.

2702
04:25:28,583 --> 04:25:32,206
But it was the Iron Hog, Colton Mertens, that loaded up.

2703
04:25:33,087 --> 04:25:37,851
Not 550, not 560, but 570 pounds.

2704
04:25:38,491 --> 04:25:43,396
And unfortunately for the rest of the field, I'm going to tell you, there was room in the tank for a few more.

2705
04:25:44,437 --> 04:25:45,898
So impressive by Colton Mertens.

2706
04:25:46,378 --> 04:25:47,379
Double payday for him.

2707
04:25:47,619 --> 04:25:49,581
Lou Jauzum coming through, cutting the checks.

2708
04:25:50,382 --> 04:25:51,162
He earned every dollar.

2709
04:25:51,923 --> 04:25:56,307
Colton Mertens takes the heat as his coach celebrates along with the

2710
04:25:58,306 --> 04:26:10,310
crowd here at MVP Arena as Colton Mertens sets the bar pretty high for the next heat.

2711
04:26:13,211 --> 04:26:17,512
Third and final heat, the individual men take on the back squats next.

2712
04:27:05,263 --> 04:27:11,568
Welcome back to the MVP arena here in Albany, New York, the new home of the 2025 CrossFit Games.

2713
04:27:12,048 --> 04:27:15,110
Today's coverage is presented by Belites.

2714
04:27:15,831 --> 04:27:19,854
I'm Chase Ingram, along with me is Adrian Conway and Mike Arsenault will join us shortly.

2715
04:27:20,394 --> 04:27:25,138
But if you missed the action earlier this morning, you missed out.

2716
04:27:25,378 --> 04:27:31,563
Jay Crouch takes the event and takes the leader jersey from Jason Hopper.

2717
04:27:32,941 --> 04:27:34,702
He did it in impressive fashion, too, Chase.

2718
04:27:34,742 --> 04:27:38,103
We talked about him earlier today being a threat that kind of slides under the radar.

2719
04:27:38,604 --> 04:27:40,945
And someone must have told him, and he wanted to put us on notice.

2720
04:27:40,965 --> 04:27:46,608
Let me tell you, when it has running, when it has deadlifts, when it has handstand walking, you're going to need to watch out for Mr. J. Crouch.

2721
04:27:46,968 --> 04:27:49,229
J. Crouch is sitting there, take this black shirt off of me.

2722
04:27:49,289 --> 04:27:50,449
I want the leader jersey.

2723
04:27:51,150 --> 04:27:53,171
J. Crouch sits on top of the leaderboard.

2724
04:27:53,191 --> 04:27:59,614
12-point lead over Jason Hopper, and Jeff Adler has moved back into podium position.

2725
04:28:00,892 --> 04:28:03,714
Only four points ahead of Ricky Garrard.

2726
04:28:05,015 --> 04:28:07,757
Individual event five is simply named the back squat.

2727
04:28:08,618 --> 04:28:10,199
Sponsored by Liu Zhangjun.

2728
04:28:11,861 --> 04:28:14,002
What is your tempo recipe for success?

2729
04:28:14,343 --> 04:28:15,063
It's pretty simple here.

2730
04:28:15,083 --> 04:28:18,206
You're going to want to know your squat, which means know the style.

2731
04:28:18,226 --> 04:28:20,087
We've seen a varied approach.

2732
04:28:20,127 --> 04:28:21,268
We've got low bar back squats.

2733
04:28:21,288 --> 04:28:22,509
We've got high bar back squats.

2734
04:28:22,729 --> 04:28:23,830
You've got to optimize it for you.

2735
04:28:23,870 --> 04:28:27,313
And you want to start sharp, build confidence, not slow and sticky.

2736
04:28:27,333 --> 04:28:29,835
That doesn't set you up for success on lift two and three.

2737
04:28:31,589 --> 04:28:34,232
For more on this, let's go down to Mike Arsenault.

2738
04:28:34,893 --> 04:28:35,393
Thanks, Chase.

2739
04:28:35,453 --> 04:28:38,677
Each athlete has a 20-second lifting window to complete each lift.

2740
04:28:38,977 --> 04:28:39,718
What does that mean?

2741
04:28:39,778 --> 04:28:45,144
As long as the athlete un-racks the bar before that time elapses, they are able to complete the lift.

2742
04:28:45,504 --> 04:28:52,252
In previous heats, we have seen a few athletes utilize the safety bars if they fail the weight.

2743
04:28:52,812 --> 04:29:02,018
It falls on the back and it's protected from the floor with those safety straps and it's up to the athlete to then unload the bar and get it back on the J hooks before they complete their next attempt.

2744
04:29:04,920 --> 04:29:08,102
Your lane assignments, your top 10 after four events.

2745
04:29:08,142 --> 04:29:13,907
We're not even halfway through the weekend yet and fireworks are already flying.

2746
04:29:14,787 --> 04:29:19,951
And in this heat, we have not only your top 10s, but several games, champ.

2747
04:29:20,632 --> 04:29:22,413
Two of those belong to Justin Medeiros.

2748
04:29:23,354 --> 04:29:26,336
And we know that Justin Medeiros is a tremendous competitor, Chase.

2749
04:29:26,696 --> 04:29:29,158
He's coming in this year looking as fit as ever.

2750
04:29:30,379 --> 04:29:31,260
He follows coaching.

2751
04:29:32,342 --> 04:29:38,885
from Adam Nefer and also Jesse Bufano that really go into practice a lot with practicing and maxing out.

2752
04:29:38,925 --> 04:29:41,265
It's a part of regular upper and lower lifts for both of them.

2753
04:29:41,405 --> 04:29:48,528
The man who was wearing the leader jersey coming in this morning lost it in the individual event number four, but only a few points behind.

2754
04:29:49,008 --> 04:29:51,990
And he has himself a pretty heavy one rep max squad himself.

2755
04:29:53,370 --> 04:30:00,493
Jay Crouch, who in his interview said, Dave must have been watching my Instagram lately because these events

2756
04:30:01,623 --> 04:30:03,164
Post up very well for me.

2757
04:30:06,005 --> 04:30:06,946
Kalyan Soza.

2758
04:30:09,527 --> 04:30:10,647
Second place finish.

2759
04:30:13,689 --> 04:30:17,011
In event number four, finds himself inside the top ten.

2760
04:30:18,812 --> 04:30:20,233
Sosa with a great lift there.

2761
04:30:20,273 --> 04:30:21,814
He's a tall drink of water now.

2762
04:30:21,854 --> 04:30:28,759
He's not a short guy, so he's got a long distance to travel to get to that below parallel position, and had some great positions on his way down and up.

2763
04:30:29,259 --> 04:30:30,660
Alan Pepper opens with 470.

2764
04:30:30,781 --> 04:30:40,768
Pepper here, more of a low bar back squat approach, lower down on his traps, sends his hips down and back, clean, as can be on 470.

2765
04:30:41,048 --> 04:30:44,971
Your 2024 CrossFit Games champion, James Sprague, opening up with 440.

2766
04:30:49,717 --> 04:30:53,320
James always getting that bar as low as he possibly can on his traps here.

2767
04:30:53,340 --> 04:30:55,602
440 is a great opening lift for him.

2768
04:30:56,082 --> 04:30:57,884
Strength is something that he's been working at tremendously.

2769
04:30:59,265 --> 04:31:03,448
Harry Lightfoot sitting in seventh overall after four events.

2770
04:31:05,530 --> 04:31:06,311
Opening attempt at 445.

2771
04:31:15,344 --> 04:31:18,465
Great lift there for Harry, no hesitation, great timing.

2772
04:31:18,785 --> 04:31:25,407
Again, from a timing perspective, we're looking at the hips down and back, with control at the top, and then a faster stretch reflex out of the bottom.

2773
04:31:25,467 --> 04:31:26,728
We'll see what Roman chooses here.

2774
04:31:26,968 --> 04:31:32,570
Roman Krenikov, sixth overall.

2775
04:31:32,650 --> 04:31:33,490
475s his opening weight.

2776
04:31:36,071 --> 04:31:42,893
And that's good for Roman, as he's leaning on the crowd to get him through this max lift.

2777
04:31:43,874 --> 04:31:44,834
Justin Medeiros.

2778
04:31:46,542 --> 04:31:49,824
Looking in championship form.

2779
04:31:51,725 --> 04:31:52,405
Opens at 470.

2780
04:31:52,486 --> 04:31:58,449
Smooth opener there for Justin.

2781
04:31:58,469 --> 04:31:59,730
Again, mechanically.

2782
04:31:59,770 --> 04:32:01,671
Watch the way he gets the bar in and out of the rack.

2783
04:32:02,031 --> 04:32:02,852
It's routine for him.

2784
04:32:02,872 --> 04:32:03,832
He dials in the details.

2785
04:32:03,852 --> 04:32:09,436
Ricky Garrard, four points out of a podium position.

2786
04:32:21,810 --> 04:32:28,253
Jeff Adler, your 2023 CrossFit Games champion.

2787
04:32:28,533 --> 04:32:33,436
Three previous champions in this third and final heat for the men.

2788
04:32:35,037 --> 04:32:38,859
Three podium finishers in this final heat for the men.

2789
04:32:40,300 --> 04:32:42,621
Strong lift at 445 there for Adler.

2790
04:32:44,242 --> 04:32:46,243
Jason Hopper sitting in second. 485.

2791
04:32:54,588 --> 04:32:55,329
45 is good.

2792
04:32:56,670 --> 04:32:58,952
Yeah, that's a great opener at 485 for Hopper.

2793
04:33:00,153 --> 04:33:10,101
Jay Crouch wearing the white leader jersey for the first time in his career after his first career event win in individual event number four.

2794
04:33:11,963 --> 04:33:15,166
Gotta be good at 445 and round one is done.

2795
04:33:19,290 --> 04:33:20,551
Back to Calle and Souza.

2796
04:33:23,232 --> 04:33:25,253
And this is where the competition really comes to life.

2797
04:33:25,293 --> 04:33:33,036
Everybody being a bit conservative with their openers, and now we'll start to see either what they have potential to stretch to, or if they're going to make this their best lift here at Attempt 2.

2798
04:33:33,216 --> 04:33:37,558
415 is good.

2799
04:33:40,020 --> 04:33:42,601
We still have Burton's best weight of 570.

2800
04:33:47,903 --> 04:33:51,165
has the best lift as Dallin Pepper settles in for 495.

2801
04:33:51,225 --> 04:33:55,067
Got it.

2802
04:33:57,628 --> 04:33:58,749
Great lift there by Pepper.

2803
04:33:59,309 --> 04:34:01,110
Low bar approach, butt down and back.

2804
04:34:01,150 --> 04:34:03,431
Helps him stay firm through his midline, too.

2805
04:34:03,891 --> 04:34:06,593
You use this low bar approach just like we're gonna see from Sprague here.

2806
04:34:06,933 --> 04:34:10,695
It helps you stay very firm through your mid-back as you squat down and up.

2807
04:34:11,815 --> 04:34:13,716
Sprague will get 455.

2808
04:34:16,428 --> 04:34:22,151
It's not the heaviest weight we've seen, but that is a good weight for James Sprague.

2809
04:34:22,271 --> 04:34:23,692
465 on the bar for Lightfoot.

2810
04:34:25,673 --> 04:34:27,514
Lightfoot had a pretty squat on the first one.

2811
04:34:27,874 --> 04:34:30,435
He's got that medium approach, not too high on his shoulders.

2812
04:34:31,556 --> 04:34:34,197
Smooth tempo down, control on the way up.

2813
04:34:34,217 --> 04:34:36,939
I mean, it looks like there's a lot left in the tank there for her.

2814
04:34:39,640 --> 04:34:41,081
We've got five lifts.

2815
04:34:42,703 --> 04:34:59,288
Over 500 pounds as Roman sets up for 485.

2816
04:34:59,448 --> 04:35:00,569
45 is good for Roman.

2817
04:35:00,589 --> 04:35:06,231
490 on the bar for Justin Medeiros.

2818
04:35:09,392 --> 04:35:09,792
Open with 470.

2819
04:35:14,989 --> 04:35:15,309
Got it.

2820
04:35:16,430 --> 04:35:17,930
Great control there for Justin.

2821
04:35:18,831 --> 04:35:19,671
Again, routine.

2822
04:35:24,013 --> 04:35:27,575
Ricky calling for the assistance from the crowd here.

2823
04:35:27,935 --> 04:35:29,576
4.55 on the bar for Ricky Garrard.

2824
04:35:37,500 --> 04:35:37,780
Wow.

2825
04:35:39,349 --> 04:35:40,471
No, your squad is huge.

2826
04:35:40,571 --> 04:35:48,405
I mean, look at the control Ricky goes down with and is still able to render that great stretch reflex out of the bottom to pop him right up.

2827
04:35:48,805 --> 04:35:50,007
475 for Jeff Adler.

2828
04:35:50,027 --> 04:35:53,012
And he'll, oh.

2829
04:35:55,765 --> 04:35:56,866
It looked like he had it, Chase.

2830
04:35:56,926 --> 04:35:58,747
I wonder if he almost got a little lightheaded there.

2831
04:35:58,767 --> 04:36:02,911
Because he was really close to coming out of that sticky part of the squat.

2832
04:36:03,211 --> 04:36:05,953
And his eyes looked a little lost as he bailed that lift.

2833
04:36:06,093 --> 04:36:07,234
And here we go.

2834
04:36:07,634 --> 04:36:10,396
Our first 500-pound attempt for heat number three.

2835
04:36:10,416 --> 04:36:11,997
And it belongs to Chase and Hopper.

2836
04:36:16,721 --> 04:36:18,723
Hopper will get it.

2837
04:36:21,345 --> 04:36:23,267
Great lift, Jason Hopper.

2838
04:36:24,128 --> 04:36:26,750
Jay Crouch asking for a little help from the crowd.

2839
04:36:27,490 --> 04:36:28,191
Putting on 485.

2840
04:36:28,511 --> 04:36:30,313
Big jump here for Jay.

2841
04:36:30,793 --> 04:36:34,677
He knows he's only 12 points ahead of Jason Hopper, so he has to stay close.

2842
04:36:34,697 --> 04:36:40,982
He's got to get this.

2843
04:36:41,002 --> 04:36:41,963
Got to fight, Jay.

2844
04:36:41,983 --> 04:36:42,123
Wow.

2845
04:36:42,144 --> 04:36:42,784
Two rounds done.

2846
04:36:42,824 --> 04:36:44,385
We've got two 485s on the bars.

2847
04:36:44,726 --> 04:36:46,247
Callie and Souza sets up for 425.

2848
04:36:48,871 --> 04:37:04,437
Roman hit 485, Crouch 485, Medeiros 490, Pepper 495, and with Hopper hitting 500, that's six guys at 500 or more.

2849
04:37:05,937 --> 04:37:13,880
This five pound jump would put Dowin into that fifth place position.

2850
04:37:21,909 --> 04:37:24,310
So Dallin's gonna keep 495.

2851
04:37:26,371 --> 04:37:27,191
James Sprague.

2852
04:37:28,152 --> 04:37:32,974
This is a big lift for James, just to stay in contention.

2853
04:37:34,574 --> 04:37:36,135
With a long weekend left to go.

2854
04:37:36,155 --> 04:37:36,895
Got it!

2855
04:37:36,935 --> 04:37:37,035
Wow!

2856
04:37:38,396 --> 04:37:39,957
And that's big for Sprague.

2857
04:37:39,977 --> 04:37:41,837
And he knows it.

2858
04:37:42,818 --> 04:37:48,820
And for James, the rest of the weekend's gonna be wide open.

2859
04:37:48,840 --> 04:37:49,841
485 in the bar for Lightfoot.

2860
04:37:54,803 --> 04:37:56,724
Oh, and Harry knows.

2861
04:37:56,744 --> 04:37:57,324
More there.

2862
04:37:57,624 --> 04:37:58,924
Yeah, there's more there.

2863
04:37:59,704 --> 04:38:00,525
He's celebrating that.

2864
04:38:00,545 --> 04:38:07,407
He's probably had some great strength progress through the summer in training because there's some poundage left, and that's a pleasant surprise for an athlete.

2865
04:38:08,147 --> 04:38:08,707
Roman hit 485.

2866
04:38:08,747 --> 04:38:11,008
495 on the bar for Roman.

2867
04:38:24,731 --> 04:38:24,791
Wow.

2868
04:38:24,831 --> 04:38:25,812
You want to talk about fight.

2869
04:38:25,832 --> 04:38:28,294
He saw that one all the way through until he couldn't anymore.

2870
04:38:28,334 --> 04:38:29,835
This is big for Medeiros.

2871
04:38:29,935 --> 04:38:35,260
He's sitting in fifth place overall.

2872
04:38:38,502 --> 04:38:39,123
He got it.

2873
04:38:39,563 --> 04:38:44,847
Justin is doing Justin things.

2874
04:38:44,867 --> 04:38:47,970
5.05 for Justin Medeiros.

2875
04:38:47,990 --> 04:38:50,352
4.65 for Ricky.

2876
04:38:55,537 --> 04:39:03,102
If he gets this, that'll put him outside the top 20.

2877
04:39:08,205 --> 04:39:10,867
Adler with another attempt at 470.

2878
04:39:15,730 --> 04:39:23,255
Two more lifters to go, and they're sitting on top of the leaderboard as Jason Hopper throws on 505.

2879
04:39:23,355 --> 04:39:23,455
Yep.

2880
04:39:26,368 --> 04:39:27,609
Needs it.

2881
04:39:27,629 --> 04:39:29,930
505 is tied for fifth at the moment.

2882
04:39:30,711 --> 04:39:33,212
And it's just Medeiros that holds that spot.

2883
04:39:33,912 --> 04:39:35,473
And Medeiros will have it alone.

2884
04:39:39,256 --> 04:39:44,098
Huge for Crouch here.

2885
04:39:44,639 --> 04:39:48,801
If he can get this, he may be able to hold on to this jersey for another event. 495.

2886
04:39:53,942 --> 04:39:55,723
And he's not going to get it.

2887
04:39:55,883 --> 04:39:57,644
And that'll put him at 485.

2888
04:39:57,764 --> 04:40:01,907
And Justin Medeiros wins the heat.

2889
04:40:03,107 --> 04:40:08,851
And Justin Medeiros, we've seen this before.

2890
04:40:09,471 --> 04:40:11,872
12th, 2nd, 4th, 9th.

2891
04:40:12,493 --> 04:40:16,175
Not many event wins, but lots and lots of top fives.

2892
04:40:16,515 --> 04:40:18,416
And he may have stacked another one.

2893
04:40:18,976 --> 04:40:21,198
And Justin Medeiros looks very dangerous.

2894
04:40:24,615 --> 04:40:27,977
We had some great squats in this heat as we knew we would.

2895
04:40:28,597 --> 04:40:33,059
And this is Dallin Pepper putting on a show with a bit more of a low bar back squat here.

2896
04:40:33,079 --> 04:40:40,803
Again, knowing yourself, drive through the middle, getting his hips forward and not being denied, no matter what that weight was on his back.

2897
04:40:40,843 --> 04:40:45,226
But it was Hopper getting up underneath this 500 pounds that really fired up the crowd.

2898
04:40:45,746 --> 04:40:48,147
Hopper using a very opposite approach to Pepper.

2899
04:40:48,387 --> 04:40:52,870
High bar, keeping that chest tall, drives through the middle, a little sticky.

2900
04:40:53,490 --> 04:40:54,651
No problem for Mr. Hopper.

2901
04:40:54,671 --> 04:40:55,552
He saw it all the way through.

2902
04:40:58,173 --> 04:41:03,117
But it was Justin Medeiros, the one that's building this dangerous momentum through the course of the weekend.

2903
04:41:03,357 --> 04:41:09,702
We talked about Jesse Bufano, Adam Nefer, priming him with maxing outlifts by strategy every week.

2904
04:41:10,042 --> 04:41:12,344
And it's a skill that Medeiros has learned to master.

2905
04:41:12,384 --> 04:41:12,764
Look at that.

2906
04:41:12,904 --> 04:41:15,706
That's how you meet yourself where you're at and maximize where you're at today.

2907
04:41:15,926 --> 04:41:17,868
Justin Medeiros putting on a show with the back squat.

2908
04:41:19,120 --> 04:41:25,763
As the dearest clan in the stands as they always are cheering on the two-time CrossFit Games champ at 505.

2909
04:41:26,724 --> 04:41:32,886
And it is Colton Mertens who put on a show for this crowd inside the MVP arena.

2910
04:41:32,906 --> 04:41:34,687
He's down with Mike Arsenault.

2911
04:41:35,508 --> 04:41:38,769
Colton, we have the Colton Mertens fan club over our right shoulder.

2912
04:41:38,789 --> 04:41:39,429
100 points, 570 pounds.

2913
04:41:44,437 --> 04:41:46,358
And it looked like there was more left in the tank.

2914
04:41:46,378 --> 04:41:49,879
You really didn't get a push from the guys in heat number two to see if you had more than 570.

2915
04:41:50,879 --> 04:41:52,919
How much was left, if necessary?

2916
04:41:54,420 --> 04:41:58,121
I think I underestimated the bump I was going to get from the crowd a little bit.

2917
04:41:58,141 --> 04:42:00,882
570 felt the same as 400 did in the back.

2918
04:42:01,782 --> 04:42:05,023
So I'm not sure how much more I had in the tank, but it felt way better on the floor.

2919
04:42:05,605 --> 04:42:11,410
And that was a new one-rep max back squat PR for you, 570 pounds, picking up those 100 points.

2920
04:42:11,710 --> 04:42:12,711
A rough day one.

2921
04:42:12,771 --> 04:42:15,593
How did you reset yourself mentally to come into the weekend?

2922
04:42:16,574 --> 04:42:17,414
Yeah, day one sucked.

2923
04:42:17,735 --> 04:42:22,178
But I got to get my ass to work and start climbing up that leaderboard.

2924
04:42:22,198 --> 04:42:23,720
100 points on this one.

2925
04:42:23,740 --> 04:42:25,341
We got 200 points available tonight.

2926
04:42:25,421 --> 04:42:26,442
And we're going to go for broke.

2927
04:42:29,664 --> 04:42:32,427
A great start to that comeback, potentially, Colton.

2928
04:42:32,467 --> 04:42:33,187
Congratulations.

2929
04:42:33,207 --> 04:42:33,447
Well done.

2930
04:42:33,808 --> 04:42:34,008
Thank you.

2931
04:42:40,675 --> 04:42:42,976
The Liu Zhangzhu promo offer, guys.

2932
04:42:43,257 --> 04:42:48,700
Looking for a serious upgrade in your lift, save 15% on the Liu Zhangzhu shoes.

2933
04:42:48,740 --> 04:43:02,248
Scan the QR code now or head to liuzhangzhu.com and grab your pair because Colton Mertens just got $6,000 richer with that Event 5 win.

2934
04:43:02,269 --> 04:43:05,851
The men are done, but the women are coming up next.

2935
04:47:04,137 --> 04:47:09,641
Welcome back inside MVP Arena here in Albany, New York for the 2025 CrossFit Games.

2936
04:47:10,881 --> 04:47:12,943
You're getting set for individual event number five.

2937
04:47:13,043 --> 04:47:13,923
I'm Chase Ingram.

2938
04:47:13,943 --> 04:47:16,145
Along with me is Adrian Conway.

2939
04:47:16,645 --> 04:47:19,267
Mike Arsenault will be down on the floor later.

2940
04:47:20,269 --> 04:47:29,336
Women's event number five, presented by Lu Xuanju, is simple as a one rep max back squat, but it is not that easy.

2941
04:47:29,737 --> 04:47:31,998
Adrian, what are your tempo recipe for success?

2942
04:47:32,479 --> 04:47:36,862
These athletes need to know their squat, which means, are they going to go low bar?

2943
04:47:36,982 --> 04:47:38,223
Are they going to go high bar?

2944
04:47:38,384 --> 04:47:39,224
Are they going to move fast?

2945
04:47:39,264 --> 04:47:40,005
Are they going to move slow?

2946
04:47:40,045 --> 04:47:46,050
And they need to start sharp and not slow, meaning that they need to build momentum for lift number two and lift number three.

2947
04:47:47,138 --> 04:47:52,261
Your lane assignments, three heats of 10, starting with our bottom 10 after four events.

2948
04:47:53,522 --> 04:47:56,444
So we have three total heats of this maxed back squat.

2949
04:47:58,245 --> 04:48:05,589
Your vision fuels victory athletes to watch over there in lane number two, Mariana Meza out of Mexico, taking the floor here.

2950
04:48:05,609 --> 04:48:09,772
Mariana has actually been on the scene.

2951
04:48:09,792 --> 04:48:14,435
If you've been following Guadalupe Luza Latin Cup, she's won it two years in a row.

2952
04:48:15,687 --> 04:48:17,629
Now she's on the big stage here at the CrossFit Games.

2953
04:48:18,210 --> 04:48:21,834
On the big stage as a rookie with a listed back squad at 335.

2954
04:48:22,375 --> 04:48:25,919
So she's got to be a natural, someone that we keep our eyes on in this one, Rip Max.

2955
04:48:27,600 --> 04:48:32,625
Emily DeRoy is back from individual competition for the second time.

2956
04:48:33,726 --> 04:48:37,870
As DeRoy has one of the heaviest listed squats for the women.

2957
04:48:37,890 --> 04:48:41,094
Although, if it's anything like the men, we might as well throw those maxes out the window.

2958
04:48:41,814 --> 04:48:48,161
As we bring in a guest to the booth that knows a little bit about competing on the competition floor, Alex Kazan.

2959
04:48:48,521 --> 04:48:48,901
Welcome.

2960
04:48:49,142 --> 04:48:50,123
Hi, thanks for having me.

2961
04:48:50,623 --> 04:48:53,706
Alex, we've seen some crazy weights tossed up by the dudes.

2962
04:48:53,766 --> 04:48:55,988
You've been on this competition floor for years.

2963
04:48:56,549 --> 04:48:58,511
You've done max lifts in front of the crowds.

2964
04:48:58,871 --> 04:49:02,134
What is it about the crowd that boosts those lifts for an athlete?

2965
04:49:02,535 --> 04:49:03,596
Oh, there's nothing like it.

2966
04:49:03,676 --> 04:49:05,197
Like, the adrenaline.

2967
04:49:05,738 --> 04:49:08,060
I swear you could lift whatever you think you can lift.

2968
04:49:08,100 --> 04:49:09,321
You can lift 20 pounds more.

2969
04:49:09,401 --> 04:49:09,882
It's so cool.

2970
04:49:10,543 --> 04:49:13,188
In the background, I'm assuming the warm-up area, you're sitting with your coach.

2971
04:49:13,208 --> 04:49:14,009
You've got a plan.

2972
04:49:14,070 --> 04:49:14,891
This is lift one.

2973
04:49:14,911 --> 04:49:16,414
Maybe look for me for two, three.

2974
04:49:16,895 --> 04:49:18,558
But does that plan every once in a while?

2975
04:49:18,578 --> 04:49:19,139
You're like, I don't know.

2976
04:49:19,159 --> 04:49:20,001
That felt pretty good.

2977
04:49:20,021 --> 04:49:22,405
Maybe we'll go off script a little bit.

2978
04:49:23,018 --> 04:49:25,640
Yeah, I feel like Justin and I usually have a pretty good game plan.

2979
04:49:26,801 --> 04:49:28,462
First lift, you always want something safe.

2980
04:49:29,102 --> 04:49:30,263
Get a good number on the board.

2981
04:49:30,543 --> 04:49:32,664
Second lift is like you're, I'm happy with this.

2982
04:49:32,704 --> 04:49:33,405
This will be good.

2983
04:49:33,945 --> 04:49:37,047
And then you want to set yourself up to have some fun on that third lift.

2984
04:49:37,467 --> 04:49:38,348
Caroline Prevost.

2985
04:49:38,388 --> 04:49:41,190
Now, Alex, you did qualify out of the NorCal Classic.

2986
04:49:41,210 --> 04:49:45,433
Caroline Prevost, since you had a withdrawal due to injury, got that spot for you.

2987
04:49:46,233 --> 04:49:49,534
And not pouring salt in the wound, but you've competed here.

2988
04:49:49,674 --> 04:49:51,515
You've finished at the highest level.

2989
04:49:51,875 --> 04:49:54,996
You get to sit back and watch this for the first time from the stands.

2990
04:49:55,036 --> 04:49:57,477
But talk about you had to be there.

2991
04:49:58,378 --> 04:50:02,219
What does it feel like from the outside looking in, for those that cannot understand at home?

2992
04:50:03,660 --> 04:50:04,160
Yeah.

2993
04:50:04,240 --> 04:50:05,941
Like, for me, it's really bittersweet to watch.

2994
04:50:06,021 --> 04:50:09,762
Like, I'm just sitting here like, man, like, I want to throw some weight around and be down there.

2995
04:50:11,403 --> 04:50:12,743
Yeah, these athletes are incredible.

2996
04:50:12,843 --> 04:50:14,344
And yeah, it's really fun.

2997
04:50:16,005 --> 04:50:17,746
Luisa Marquez will kick things off.

2998
04:50:19,027 --> 04:50:17,746
270.

2999
04:50:19,348 --> 04:50:24,672
Now, I heard you play some bets earlier on a podcast of what that number may be.

3000
04:50:24,712 --> 04:50:27,093
What do we think we may see?

3001
04:50:27,154 --> 04:50:29,235
Does it change after you saw what the men did?

3002
04:50:30,016 --> 04:50:31,096
No, I'm going with my gut.

3003
04:50:31,137 --> 04:50:31,877
My first thing was 350.

3004
04:50:31,917 --> 04:50:34,999
I feel like we're going to see at least someone hit 350.

3005
04:50:36,781 --> 04:50:37,982
That's what I would have wanted to hit.

3006
04:50:38,142 --> 04:50:41,725
Caroline Prevost sets up for 295.

3007
04:50:46,440 --> 04:50:52,242
We are going to go through three rounds of this one-rep backs, back squat attempt.

3008
04:50:52,322 --> 04:50:53,862
Athletes will have 20 seconds.

3009
04:50:53,942 --> 04:50:59,024
Now, Alex, how is the recovery from that injury you sustained earlier?

3010
04:50:59,784 --> 04:51:01,505
Definitely getting a lot better on the mend.

3011
04:51:02,245 --> 04:51:05,786
For a while, I had some nerve damage, and it's starting to come all back.

3012
04:51:05,906 --> 04:51:09,607
And now just getting my calves and all the surrounding muscles firing again.

3013
04:51:09,627 --> 04:51:12,408
So yeah, definitely much, much better.

3014
04:51:13,887 --> 04:51:15,809
Sunghyun Choi.

3015
04:51:18,352 --> 04:51:19,533
She'll get her first lift.

3016
04:51:19,553 --> 04:51:21,855
280 on the bar for Christina.

3017
04:51:38,544 --> 04:51:41,906
Alex, how important is that first lift?

3018
04:51:41,986 --> 04:51:47,029
Not necessarily about the weights you put on the bar, but building confidence for the second and third attempts.

3019
04:51:47,269 --> 04:51:53,293
Yeah, for myself, and I think a lot of athletes can agree, the way you feel plays a huge impact on how the lifts go.

3020
04:51:53,793 --> 04:51:59,897
So you want that first lift, especially after being in the corral and being tight, you want that first lift to feel good and fast.

3021
04:51:59,937 --> 04:52:01,838
So that way you keep that going into the next one.

3022
04:52:02,078 --> 04:52:06,781
Just saw a miss from Emily DeRoy, who has one of the top five lifted maxes.

3023
04:52:07,261 --> 04:52:08,802
Yeah, that's a tough way to start there.

3024
04:52:09,363 --> 04:52:11,864
One of the keys is to start sharp, not slow.

3025
04:52:13,085 --> 04:52:19,029
And now she's going to have to make some really hard choices as we watch Mikulishin have a successful opening attempt.

3026
04:52:19,049 --> 04:52:27,915
First 300-plus successful lift we've seen, as Maria Camila Quintero sets up for 290.

3027
04:52:28,235 --> 04:52:30,957
Now, Alex, we talked about having a successful lift.

3028
04:52:31,944 --> 04:52:34,266
What's the plan B if we miss the first one?

3029
04:52:34,607 --> 04:52:36,829
Oh, I've been there a time or two.

3030
04:52:37,930 --> 04:52:40,933
Unfortunately for me, usually my misses have involved Olympic lifting.

3031
04:52:41,013 --> 04:52:43,495
And sometimes you just got to pull and pray at that point.

3032
04:52:44,316 --> 04:52:49,641
But I think with the back squat, you can be a little more meticulous and kind of assess, hey, was that just too heavy?

3033
04:52:49,701 --> 04:52:53,085
Or did I just miss my time out of the bottom?

3034
04:52:53,165 --> 04:52:54,126
And then you make your choice.

3035
04:52:55,927 --> 04:53:01,672
But you've got to be smart, because if you miss two in a row, then you're putting yourself in a hole.

3036
04:53:01,752 --> 04:53:04,254
Jen Muir nails 325 and she's hitting 350.

3037
04:53:04,594 --> 04:53:05,955
Jen Muir is one of those athletes.

3038
04:53:06,075 --> 04:53:10,719
Everyone talks about maybe her endurance or gymnastics because of success at the semifinal level.

3039
04:53:11,219 --> 04:53:14,622
Jen Muir has a power lifting background that most people don't know about.

3040
04:53:14,682 --> 04:53:17,285
Well, and that was obvious there, even in her setup and execution.

3041
04:53:17,325 --> 04:53:23,311
Low bar approach, hips very far back, chest cantilevered forward, and she smoked it using that strategy.

3042
04:53:24,152 --> 04:53:29,578
325 is the heaviest weight we've seen as we make our way back around for round number two.

3043
04:53:29,598 --> 04:53:33,342
Luisa Marquez, also 290 on the bar.

3044
04:53:35,431 --> 04:53:36,211
will not get it.

3045
04:53:36,571 --> 04:53:40,392
Now, athletes, it's different from event to event, year to year.

3046
04:53:40,452 --> 04:53:45,334
But in this case, they are allowed to go down from that attempt in case they miss it.

3047
04:53:45,614 --> 04:53:46,274
Yeah, that's nice.

3048
04:53:46,354 --> 04:53:49,875
It kind of gives you that freedom to play a little bit and not be so stuck.

3049
04:53:52,095 --> 04:53:55,556
Yeah, it really allows you to have a little less pressure in these jumps.

3050
04:53:55,636 --> 04:53:56,917
Wow.

3051
04:53:57,657 --> 04:53:58,657
Great finish there by Meza.

3052
04:53:58,677 --> 04:53:59,617
295 is good for Meza.

3053
04:54:02,015 --> 04:54:04,279
As Prevost is loading up the bar to 315.

3054
04:54:04,319 --> 04:54:04,499
315 is good.

3055
04:54:17,230 --> 04:54:22,574
Yeah, good clean lift, and what we'll be looking for on her next jump, Chase, is her ability to get the hips forward out of the bottom.

3056
04:54:22,914 --> 04:54:25,175
A lot like we saw with some of the earlier lifts from the men.

3057
04:54:25,696 --> 04:54:28,758
If the hips lag behind too long, you're just going to have to dump it forward.

3058
04:54:29,318 --> 04:54:33,281
Here come the threes as Seungyeon Choi goes from 295 to 310.

3059
04:54:38,145 --> 04:54:38,665
It's so funny.

3060
04:54:38,725 --> 04:54:42,286
I have, like, the same, like, nerve feelings that, like, I would have down there.

3061
04:54:42,346 --> 04:54:43,427
I'm like, why am I shaking?

3062
04:54:43,527 --> 04:54:45,127
Oh, I'm watching you squat with them.

3063
04:54:45,167 --> 04:54:45,707
Yeah, I know.

3064
04:54:45,727 --> 04:54:46,928
You're leaning back a little bit.

3065
04:54:46,948 --> 04:54:47,828
They're leaning forward.

3066
04:54:49,388 --> 04:54:55,990
It's very hard not to do that, except, Alex, you'll be very tired if you do 30 back squats every time you have to take the floor.

3067
04:54:58,211 --> 04:54:58,951
Oh, 295.

3068
04:55:00,832 --> 04:55:01,612
Luda Takis.

3069
04:55:03,347 --> 04:55:04,308
Gets her second lift.

3070
04:55:04,348 --> 04:55:05,969
See if she can make this one.

3071
04:55:06,509 --> 04:55:09,512
DeRoy opened with 290 and missed that.

3072
04:55:09,532 --> 04:55:11,573
There you go.

3073
04:55:11,613 --> 04:55:16,297
And at 275, I mean, it looks more maybe positioning or just wasn't in the right spot at the bottom.

3074
04:55:16,737 --> 04:55:18,239
Yeah, I mean, and you can even speak to this, Alex.

3075
04:55:18,259 --> 04:55:20,781
Think about the accumulation of work they've already experienced.

3076
04:55:20,941 --> 04:55:21,101
Oh, yeah.

3077
04:55:21,141 --> 04:55:24,423
Does that go into a lot of the decision making, at least with an opener and then maybe the second lift?

3078
04:55:24,824 --> 04:55:27,366
Yeah, I think, obviously, I don't know what their body feels like.

3079
04:55:27,426 --> 04:55:30,908
But I can tell you the times I've competed, day two, day three of the CrossFit Games,

3080
04:55:32,020 --> 04:55:32,961
Rollin' with what you got.

3081
04:55:32,981 --> 04:55:37,583
McElishan adds another 10 pounds.

3082
04:55:37,603 --> 04:55:38,404
320 is good.

3083
04:55:38,564 --> 04:55:38,804
Wow.

3084
04:55:38,984 --> 04:55:43,007
But I'll say, even if you're sore, though, there's something about here, like, it doesn't matter.

3085
04:55:43,207 --> 04:55:49,691
Like, you still pull out the numbers that, like, you don't think you can hit.

3086
04:55:49,711 --> 04:55:50,191
295 on the bar.

3087
04:55:50,211 --> 04:55:54,294
A five-pound increase from 290.

3088
04:55:54,634 --> 04:55:55,655
That's good for Quintero.

3089
04:55:55,675 --> 04:55:57,456
All right, where'd she go?

3090
04:55:57,476 --> 04:55:57,456
345?

3091
04:55:57,496 --> 04:55:57,456
345. 345.

3092
04:56:01,734 --> 04:56:02,695
for Jan Muir.

3093
04:56:07,019 --> 04:56:08,901
People are going to see this akin to what Justin did.

3094
04:56:09,141 --> 04:56:09,902
Look at that setup.

3095
04:56:09,962 --> 04:56:12,745
It's a one-two step back up from the rack.

3096
04:56:13,926 --> 04:56:14,547
Deep breath.

3097
04:56:17,810 --> 04:56:18,811
Oh, easy.

3098
04:56:18,871 --> 04:56:19,952
Oh, my gosh.

3099
04:56:19,972 --> 04:56:22,495
You know what you do when you see a serious lifter like that?

3100
04:56:22,535 --> 04:56:23,336
You look at the shoes.

3101
04:56:23,836 --> 04:56:24,217
No doubt.

3102
04:56:26,320 --> 04:56:26,921
Oh, that was so good.

3103
04:56:26,941 --> 04:56:29,022
Yeah, she wants her heels close to the ground, man.

3104
04:56:29,042 --> 04:56:29,983
We got different approaches.

3105
04:56:30,003 --> 04:56:32,224
Some people in their flats, some people in their holy shoes.

3106
04:56:32,684 --> 04:56:36,187
Those athletes that are geared for the posterior, they like to keep their heels close to the ground.

3107
04:56:37,228 --> 04:56:39,549
Syria Mejia, she'll hit 290.

3108
04:56:40,390 --> 04:56:47,094
And we have one round left to go as Luisa Marquez sets up for 285.

3109
04:56:47,295 --> 04:56:51,157
Missed her previous lift at 290.

3110
04:56:51,237 --> 04:56:51,397
Nice.

3111
04:56:51,417 --> 04:56:54,600
There you go.

3112
04:56:54,820 --> 04:56:54,960
Wow.

3113
04:56:59,669 --> 04:57:02,711
Back squats are tricky, too, because everyone's sticking point is so different.

3114
04:57:02,731 --> 04:57:07,695
So you never know where the lift is going to be made or failed.

3115
04:57:07,715 --> 04:57:08,876
305 for Mariana Meza.

3116
04:57:09,457 --> 04:57:13,020
We watched some of the men get well above parallel and still not finish the lift.

3117
04:57:13,260 --> 04:57:15,322
Yeah, that's where my sticking point is, right there.

3118
04:57:15,402 --> 04:57:17,303
Like, when you're pretty much up.

3119
04:57:17,423 --> 04:57:18,904
Right when everybody's like, you got it.

3120
04:57:18,924 --> 04:57:20,065
I'm like, no, I don't.

3121
04:57:20,185 --> 04:57:21,126
This is the hardest part.

3122
04:57:21,507 --> 04:57:21,747
Yep.

3123
04:57:21,767 --> 04:57:23,088
305 is good.

3124
04:57:23,108 --> 04:57:23,408
325 for Prevo.

3125
04:57:26,875 --> 04:57:28,643
He's already got 315 in the bag.

3126
04:57:29,486 --> 04:57:30,470
Hoping for another 10 pounds.

3127
04:57:36,515 --> 04:57:37,335
She won't get it.

3128
04:57:37,936 --> 04:57:39,576
But 315 is still good.

3129
04:57:40,337 --> 04:57:40,837
It's tricky.

3130
04:57:41,377 --> 04:57:42,498
And it's good for third in the heat.

3131
04:57:42,798 --> 04:57:45,719
And in that lift, it's like you wanted to see good control out of the top.

3132
04:57:45,759 --> 04:57:52,482
But then at the bottom, a little bit more let go, a little speed out of the bottom might have helped her just a touch to stand through that sticking point.

3133
04:57:52,502 --> 04:57:54,523
325 for Sung Young Choi.

3134
04:57:54,543 --> 04:57:56,924
And she won't be able to get it.

3135
04:57:57,024 --> 04:57:57,805
So she's there at 310.

3136
04:57:59,650 --> 04:58:06,963
And Alex, I'm looking around, not to get ahead of ourselves, but I see a 3.55 on the bar for Jen Muir.

3137
04:58:07,103 --> 04:58:07,744
There we go.

3138
04:58:07,764 --> 04:58:11,791
3.05 for Kristina Livididakis.

3139
04:58:20,174 --> 04:58:21,815
She really saw that all the way through, though.

3140
04:58:21,955 --> 04:58:24,097
She wasn't going to let go of that bar prematurely.

3141
04:58:24,617 --> 04:58:27,679
She was like, nah, I'm going to make it bury me before I even bail on it.

3142
04:58:27,919 --> 04:58:28,920
300 on the bar for DeRoy.

3143
04:58:28,940 --> 04:58:30,061
She missed 290 to start.

3144
04:58:32,032 --> 04:58:33,413
Got to seventy five.

3145
04:58:33,433 --> 04:58:34,573
There you go.

3146
04:58:34,733 --> 04:58:35,833
And three hundred is good.

3147
04:58:35,913 --> 04:58:43,696
So two ninety must have just been like a lapse in timing or something like that, because that looked pretty good at these loads in this weight and how they feel.

3148
04:58:43,796 --> 04:58:47,137
Just the little thing out of balance can mean that bar is coming down.

3149
04:58:47,297 --> 04:58:47,577
Oh yeah.

3150
04:58:47,658 --> 04:58:49,958
I use a big like hip reflex out of the bottom.

3151
04:58:50,018 --> 04:58:54,680
And if I don't time that bounce right, it feels like 30 extra pounds on that bar.

3152
04:58:57,641 --> 04:58:58,441
Oh, so close.

3153
04:59:02,625 --> 04:59:04,446
320 will still be good for Mikulishin.

3154
04:59:04,526 --> 04:59:06,446
That's the second heaviest we've seen.

3155
04:59:07,546 --> 04:59:14,048
Quintero, she's got 300 on the bar.

3156
04:59:14,068 --> 04:59:14,048
290, 295.

3157
04:59:15,149 --> 04:59:15,609
Stay with 295.

3158
04:59:16,429 --> 04:59:19,810
And that right there is the beauty of those straps and these racks that we're using right now.

3159
04:59:20,250 --> 04:59:20,930
And here it is, 355.

3160
04:59:21,130 --> 04:59:24,111
Let's go, Jen.

3161
04:59:24,311 --> 04:59:24,871
She's got it.

3162
04:59:24,911 --> 04:59:26,012
Her last one was so good.

3163
04:59:29,272 --> 04:59:30,613
The rookie from Scotland.

3164
04:59:33,290 --> 04:59:34,651
Trying to add 10 pounds.

3165
04:59:40,116 --> 04:59:47,021
And Jen Muir making Alex Kazan look like one hell of an analyst right now.

3166
04:59:47,922 --> 04:59:48,903
Give me Muir.

3167
04:59:51,345 --> 04:59:52,406
I actually feel guilty.

3168
04:59:52,426 --> 04:59:56,870
I kind of forgot that she was so strong when I was thinking of who's going to hit 350.

3169
04:59:57,650 --> 04:59:59,492
And yeah, that's so awesome.

3170
04:59:59,652 --> 05:00:00,493
So maybe we'll see a few.

3171
05:00:03,567 --> 05:00:06,770
That was really good.

3172
05:00:07,070 --> 05:00:14,297
My first interaction with Jen was at Fit Fest, and she beat me in a clean cycling ladder.

3173
05:00:14,838 --> 05:00:16,259
And I was like, who is this girl?

3174
05:00:16,299 --> 05:00:17,160
Wait a second.

3175
05:00:17,240 --> 05:00:18,481
I'm sure we said girl, too.

3176
05:00:18,501 --> 05:00:20,683
Your replay is presented by Rogue Fitness.

3177
05:00:24,967 --> 05:00:31,511
And while Prevo had a very strong lift right out the gate at 315, I believe this was her second attempt.

3178
05:00:31,991 --> 05:00:33,052
The timing was there.

3179
05:00:33,112 --> 05:00:34,193
The bracing was there.

3180
05:00:34,533 --> 05:00:39,376
She had solid speed out of the bottom, but it was the fight to the middle that allowed her to stand that weight all the way up.

3181
05:00:39,436 --> 05:00:42,278
And yeah, we're talking three wheels with 315 pounds.

3182
05:00:42,318 --> 05:00:43,318
And then Mikulishin at 320 pounds.

3183
05:00:43,338 --> 05:00:44,039
Great setup here.

3184
05:00:49,742 --> 05:00:57,466
Mid-bar position for her on her back, patient enough to get her hips through the middle as well in order to help her stand that one up for a successful lift.

3185
05:00:58,707 --> 05:01:00,608
And that'll be good enough for second place.

3186
05:01:01,088 --> 05:01:10,493
But it was Jen Muir with 355 pounds, power lifter, low-bar back squat style in the flats.

3187
05:01:12,574 --> 05:01:14,315
She said, give me, give me, Muir.

3188
05:01:14,775 --> 05:01:16,396
I think I left a little bit of more in the tank.

3189
05:01:17,367 --> 05:01:20,830
What a great lift there and a great way to finish Event 5 for Jen Muir.

3190
05:01:21,310 --> 05:01:26,134
Jen Muir set the bar at 355 pounds.

3191
05:01:26,194 --> 05:01:30,478
Sydney McAleishan with 320 and Prevost at 315.

3192
05:01:30,618 --> 05:01:31,999
Alex, stick around for one more.

3193
05:01:32,059 --> 05:01:32,600
What do you say?

3194
05:01:33,020 --> 05:01:33,961
Yeah, I'll stick around for both.

3195
05:01:33,981 --> 05:01:35,662
All right, Alex will be here.

3196
05:01:35,802 --> 05:01:39,005
We'll be right back for heat number two for the individual women.

3197
05:02:23,195 --> 05:02:26,457
One heat down, two heats to go for individual action for the women.

3198
05:02:26,777 --> 05:02:30,539
In event number five, this is the 2025 CrossFit Games.

3199
05:02:31,259 --> 05:02:31,979
I'm Chase Ingram.

3200
05:02:32,019 --> 05:02:35,000
Alongside with me is Adrienne Conway and Alex Kazan.

3201
05:02:35,681 --> 05:02:37,381
In the booth with us is Mike Arsenault.

3202
05:02:37,601 --> 05:02:38,562
He's waiting on the floor.

3203
05:02:39,700 --> 05:02:58,533
We have our next 10 athletes ready to tackle the one rep max back squat presented by Lou Jean June It is a simple one they get 20 seconds at each one three rounds through You're laying assignments for heat number two your middle ten for the weekend.

3204
05:02:59,114 --> 05:03:00,435
You have 30 athletes competing

3205
05:03:02,219 --> 05:03:06,461
Does anyone have what it takes to hit 355?

3206
05:03:07,561 --> 05:03:13,003
Annika Greer is competing for the first time in a long time, and it's been a long time coming.

3207
05:03:13,084 --> 05:03:15,104
She's, let's hear more about her with Mike Garcino.

3208
05:03:15,304 --> 05:03:15,765
Thanks, Chase.

3209
05:03:15,785 --> 05:03:22,167
Yes, this is Annika's fifth attempt at qualifying for the CrossFit Games and the first time that she has qualified after a couple of near misses.

3210
05:03:22,447 --> 05:03:26,009
She said, of course, she's happy that she's here, but this is not the culmination

3211
05:03:26,369 --> 05:03:27,029
of her story.

3212
05:03:27,249 --> 05:03:37,653
To her this is just the beginning so she enjoyed for a couple days the achievement of making the games but she wants to make some noise on the leaderboard and she can start by potentially working her way into the final heat.

3213
05:03:38,013 --> 05:03:51,638
In terms of expectations for this event she said 345 will be her second attempt and then she will adjust as necessary from there with seeing what the weights that were put up in heat number one that could make her very competitive in event number five.

3214
05:03:52,847 --> 05:03:53,548
Thank you, Mike.

3215
05:03:53,708 --> 05:03:56,292
Well, 355 is the number she should be looking at.

3216
05:03:56,392 --> 05:04:00,097
Claudia Gluck, who's sitting in lane number two, is sitting 12th overall.

3217
05:04:01,007 --> 05:04:04,168
Luck making her back to back appearance here at the CrossFit Games.

3218
05:04:04,348 --> 05:04:06,228
Yes, and in 12th, that's where she finished last year.

3219
05:04:06,248 --> 05:04:10,449
And of course, with a listed back squad at 331, she's one of those athletes that we'll be watching.

3220
05:04:10,709 --> 05:04:12,250
Will she farly surpass that?

3221
05:04:12,310 --> 05:04:13,590
Will the fatigue get the best of her?

3222
05:04:13,970 --> 05:04:15,450
We'll see what she's able to do in this event.

3223
05:04:15,810 --> 05:04:22,152
In that center lane, in lane number six, you do have the 10-time Games veteran, Brooke Wells.

3224
05:04:23,272 --> 05:04:26,833
15th after four events, and Alex seeing Brooke out here.

3225
05:04:26,893 --> 05:04:28,013
She's been here so long.

3226
05:04:28,153 --> 05:04:30,754
Back in action again one more time, knowing it's the last time.

3227
05:04:31,474 --> 05:04:32,154
Yeah.

3228
05:04:32,274 --> 05:04:34,595
I'm sure her feet, like, I hope she just gets to soak it up.

3229
05:04:34,695 --> 05:04:40,436
And being removed, you kind of just realize how special the floor really is.

3230
05:04:40,536 --> 05:04:43,556
And I can't imagine, like, knowing it's your last time.

3231
05:04:43,677 --> 05:04:45,977
I'm sure she's feeling all the emotions.

3232
05:04:47,017 --> 05:04:50,158
How do you manage those emotions on the competition floor?

3233
05:04:50,620 --> 05:04:52,121
Oh, I've never retired before, Chase.

3234
05:04:52,161 --> 05:04:52,662
I don't know.

3235
05:04:53,002 --> 05:04:55,204
But you've had emotions on the competition floor.

3236
05:04:55,824 --> 05:05:00,267
Yeah, I mean, I feel like I'm pretty good at just moving through, whether it's good or bad.

3237
05:05:01,428 --> 05:05:03,150
Usually you have to address those after.

3238
05:05:03,170 --> 05:05:06,893
Maddie Kanye will kick things off, opening up with 285 pounds.

3239
05:05:10,469 --> 05:05:13,572
Talking about managing emotions, how about managing forest fires?

3240
05:05:13,793 --> 05:05:14,473
Hattie Kanyo.

3241
05:05:14,694 --> 05:05:21,881
Being squatting in front of a crowd of a couple thousand is no big deal when you're staring a blazing fire in the face as a career.

3242
05:05:22,522 --> 05:05:27,567
Yes, intensity is always relative, Chase, and that is true, even with life circumstances.

3243
05:05:28,108 --> 05:05:31,792
Maxine Neely saddling up to 295 for her first attempt.

3244
05:05:35,875 --> 05:05:37,615
You talk about speed in and out of the bottom.

3245
05:05:37,655 --> 05:05:45,738
Now, what I'm looking for for Neely is that I'd like to see just a little bit more control in that initial descend so that she can use that stretch reflex in the bottom with control.

3246
05:05:45,758 --> 05:05:49,019
Otherwise, if the weight goes up, that could lead to a little volatility there for her.

3247
05:05:51,279 --> 05:05:51,839
Abby Dommett.

3248
05:05:55,800 --> 05:05:56,821
Sitting in 18th.

3249
05:05:57,961 --> 05:06:00,962
She's good at 305, so first 300 on the board.

3250
05:06:01,322 --> 05:06:02,482
Dommett had a bit of a blend there.

3251
05:06:02,502 --> 05:06:05,263
She got on the only shoes, but she's still using that low bar approach.

3252
05:06:06,267 --> 05:06:07,508
Monica Greer opening at 325.

3253
05:06:07,588 --> 05:06:07,808
OK.

3254
05:06:07,828 --> 05:06:07,868
OK.

3255
05:06:07,908 --> 05:06:18,314
Sounds like that 345, and then the jump's probably going to be a little big.

3256
05:06:21,035 --> 05:06:28,740
Lucy McGonigal, and with the speed of that last lift, you wonder if she even goes more than what she planned on for her second lift.

3257
05:06:28,760 --> 05:06:32,162
285 for Lucy, youngest athlete in the field this year at the CrossFit Games.

3258
05:06:32,222 --> 05:06:33,302
So impressive.

3259
05:06:35,481 --> 05:06:36,722
And she's so nice to boot.

3260
05:06:40,164 --> 05:06:42,125
Brooke Wells 310 on the bar.

3261
05:06:42,145 --> 05:06:59,415
310 is good for Brooke.

3262
05:07:04,518 --> 05:07:06,339
V. Sagafi, 300 pounds.

3263
05:07:07,599 --> 05:07:14,242
Sagafi won event three last night with the pegboard and squat clean complex.

3264
05:07:15,422 --> 05:07:16,823
She's been working on her strength.

3265
05:07:16,863 --> 05:07:21,825
That was her biggest weakness for a long time that kept her out of the games, and it's what helped get her here.

3266
05:07:25,661 --> 05:07:26,721
260 for Alexis Raptus.

3267
05:07:28,742 --> 05:07:37,827
260 is good.

3268
05:07:38,428 --> 05:07:39,729
Easy work there for Alexis.

3269
05:07:42,230 --> 05:07:43,891
Claudia Gluck opening up at 315.

3270
05:07:44,051 --> 05:07:50,254
Really no more for her gymnastic prowess.

3271
05:07:52,335 --> 05:07:53,076
Gluck can squat.

3272
05:07:54,332 --> 05:07:55,272
Yeah, listed max at 331.

3273
05:07:55,632 --> 05:07:57,833
Again, if she's open at 315, this looks good.

3274
05:07:58,113 --> 05:07:59,553
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

3275
05:07:59,673 --> 05:08:00,433
That's an old max.

3276
05:08:01,454 --> 05:08:02,594
That 331 is an old max.

3277
05:08:02,954 --> 05:08:06,355
That did not look like a max.

3278
05:08:06,375 --> 05:08:12,676
295 for Gracie Walton.

3279
05:08:12,976 --> 05:08:13,416
295 is good.

3280
05:08:13,816 --> 05:08:14,717
One round down.

3281
05:08:14,737 --> 05:08:15,877
OK.

3282
05:08:16,237 --> 05:08:20,438
Three total rounds here for the winner at max back squat as we work our way back to Hatticano.

3283
05:08:26,259 --> 05:08:26,920
Kanyo going for 300.

3284
05:08:27,260 --> 05:08:31,783
Had a successful first attempt at 285.

3285
05:08:36,747 --> 05:08:38,569
Great intentionality there by Hattie.

3286
05:08:38,609 --> 05:08:43,253
I mean, she did a great job at controlling the descend, using that stretch reflex at the bottom.

3287
05:08:43,273 --> 05:08:45,454
She got some good speed there and stayed with it through the middle.

3288
05:08:46,675 --> 05:08:48,217
Speaking of speed, Lexi kneeling.

3289
05:08:48,237 --> 05:08:50,859
295 looked pretty light.

3290
05:08:50,879 --> 05:08:51,619
Let's see what she does at 310.

3291
05:08:58,814 --> 05:09:01,396
Yeah, that was that quick descent, like you said, Adrian.

3292
05:09:01,456 --> 05:09:03,717
I think that's kind of where you lose that stretch reflex.

3293
05:09:03,737 --> 05:09:05,018
Yeah, it's hard.

3294
05:09:05,058 --> 05:09:06,059
It's a hard balance, right?

3295
05:09:06,099 --> 05:09:11,663
Because especially with adrenaline and everything in the heat of the moment, it's like you've got to have just the right amount of control before you use that speed.

3296
05:09:13,504 --> 05:09:16,346
Doming, going for 320.

3297
05:09:20,308 --> 05:09:22,390
Wow, and then you talk about control.

3298
05:09:22,410 --> 05:09:23,210
That's it.

3299
05:09:23,991 --> 05:09:25,632
Control a little lower on the next one.

3300
05:09:26,132 --> 05:09:27,033
That was close.

3301
05:09:28,052 --> 05:09:28,472
You're right.

3302
05:09:29,013 --> 05:09:30,775
And that is what we're looking for.

3303
05:09:30,995 --> 05:09:33,637
The judge of standards is going to be hip crease, got to go below.

3304
05:09:33,657 --> 05:09:36,920
345, she called it.

3305
05:09:37,020 --> 05:09:38,421
Now where she's going to go?

3306
05:09:38,442 --> 05:09:43,166
The most we've seen, 355 by Jen Muir.

3307
05:09:43,186 --> 05:09:46,989
Yeah, do you think she's going to take a bigger jump to hopefully beat it?

3308
05:09:47,370 --> 05:09:48,591
Or play it like the same?

3309
05:09:48,611 --> 05:09:49,712
I put your coaching hat on.

3310
05:09:49,752 --> 05:09:50,693
You just saw that lift.

3311
05:09:51,430 --> 05:09:58,415
I mean, I feel like for myself, when you get to a certain understanding and level of the sport, you're just trying to get the points.

3312
05:09:58,555 --> 05:10:03,018
So sometimes you got to put your ego on the door and make sure you hit numbers that matter.

3313
05:10:03,438 --> 05:10:07,080
But depending if you have the room to play, it might be worth it for her to go.

3314
05:10:07,401 --> 05:10:10,923
You also have to keep in mind there's not going to be a ton of girls that hit 345.

3315
05:10:11,303 --> 05:10:13,945
So she's already given herself a really good cushion.

3316
05:10:15,226 --> 05:10:15,526
Cool.

3317
05:10:16,206 --> 05:10:16,326
Oh!

3318
05:10:21,982 --> 05:10:24,543
Greer's already moved herself in a second overall.

3319
05:10:24,563 --> 05:10:31,407
3.55 is the weight to beat as Fi Sagafi sets up for 3.15.

3320
05:10:31,447 --> 05:10:41,632
Oh, that was good.

3321
05:10:41,692 --> 05:10:43,133
What a fight from Fi.

3322
05:10:43,493 --> 05:10:45,314
That's what a one-rep max looks like.

3323
05:10:45,354 --> 05:10:46,455
That was her max.

3324
05:10:48,656 --> 05:10:49,976
Raptis setting up the 280.

3325
05:10:56,777 --> 05:10:57,657
Rappist will get it.

3326
05:10:57,678 --> 05:11:08,203
If you look behind her, it looks like 3.55 is on the bar for Annika's last attempt, as Gluck gets set for her second attempt at 3.35.

3327
05:11:08,683 --> 05:11:16,147
So this is now surpassing that listed max, at least that we've got as a reference.

3328
05:11:21,080 --> 05:11:28,975
It's wild how quickly it changes right like that first lift looks so light 305 for one

3329
05:11:33,135 --> 05:11:34,595
Oh, that looked really easy.

3330
05:11:34,615 --> 05:11:36,176
That looked almost easier than the first one.

3331
05:11:36,196 --> 05:11:36,576
That did.

3332
05:11:36,756 --> 05:11:38,076
How often does that happen?

3333
05:11:38,116 --> 05:11:39,617
You're warming up.

3334
05:11:39,797 --> 05:11:40,817
You're in the corrals.

3335
05:11:41,057 --> 05:11:43,477
It's maybe 15 minutes before you touch a barbell.

3336
05:11:43,518 --> 05:11:43,678
Oh, yeah.

3337
05:11:43,698 --> 05:11:44,698
And you come out here.

3338
05:11:44,738 --> 05:11:47,598
Does Trudy say that second attempt feel better than the first, even though it's heavier?

3339
05:11:47,919 --> 05:11:48,199
Oh, yeah.

3340
05:11:48,219 --> 05:11:54,820
I would agree 1 million percent, especially in a lift where, like, you have to go eccentric and up.

3341
05:11:54,900 --> 05:11:57,621
Like, that first one always feels kind of terrible.

3342
05:12:00,161 --> 05:12:01,562
Canyon will stick with 300.

3343
05:12:04,641 --> 05:12:08,084
Neely goes for 305, missed her last attempt.

3344
05:12:10,525 --> 05:12:10,586
At 310.

3345
05:12:10,646 --> 05:12:20,673
All right, we'll slow it down just a little.

3346
05:12:20,873 --> 05:12:23,555
Oh, nice.

3347
05:12:23,575 --> 05:12:24,015
Good lift.

3348
05:12:24,035 --> 05:12:25,856
305 is good for Lexi Neely.

3349
05:12:29,299 --> 05:12:29,399
It's 330.

3350
05:12:31,402 --> 05:12:32,703
Dummy got the hops before.

3351
05:12:32,743 --> 05:12:34,524
Yeah, she knows.

3352
05:12:34,584 --> 05:12:38,826
She's trying to call on all the energy and power that she can to make this lift.

3353
05:12:39,666 --> 05:12:41,607
It's a long time under tension here for Heavy.

3354
05:12:41,667 --> 05:12:51,152
Good fight.

3355
05:12:51,192 --> 05:12:52,593
She's got to be pretty pleased with that last lift.

3356
05:12:52,613 --> 05:12:54,354
I thought that involved a lot of muscle.

3357
05:12:54,374 --> 05:12:54,834
Here we go.

3358
05:12:59,903 --> 05:13:12,389
look she's upset literally she's like dang it I should have went 365 yes for all of us yeah easy to say in the booth though 355 is good for Greer

3359
05:13:13,468 --> 05:13:15,650
That'll still be good tied.

3360
05:13:17,292 --> 05:13:18,613
Is there a tiebreak for this event?

3361
05:13:18,633 --> 05:13:25,220
So the tiebreak, and that's what's important, is that the tiebreak is your previous lift that you hit.

3362
05:13:26,381 --> 05:13:31,206
So if Muir had done 350 and hit 355, that would break the tie at 345.

3363
05:13:31,246 --> 05:13:32,347
Then you go back to the first lift.

3364
05:13:36,060 --> 05:13:36,760
Here we got Brooke.

3365
05:13:36,780 --> 05:13:38,061
She's got 330 on the bar.

3366
05:13:38,081 --> 05:13:39,782
330 for Brooke Wells.

3367
05:13:40,002 --> 05:13:40,842
It's good.

3368
05:13:41,083 --> 05:13:47,586
And we haven't seen many smiles from Brooke this weekend yet, but we finally got one.

3369
05:13:47,626 --> 05:13:48,346
Soak it in, Ms.

3370
05:13:48,386 --> 05:13:48,747
Wells.

3371
05:13:50,587 --> 05:13:51,508
B. Sagafi.

3372
05:13:55,910 --> 05:13:57,951
Two times plus body weight.

3373
05:13:59,612 --> 05:14:04,675
Yeah, that would be an interesting stat to have their pound for pound percentages, like, at the end.

3374
05:14:05,674 --> 05:14:07,135
315 is still good for her.

3375
05:14:09,757 --> 05:14:10,758
Raftis going for 290.

3376
05:14:16,803 --> 05:14:24,129
Raftis won't get it.

3377
05:14:24,149 --> 05:14:25,970
325 on the bar for Glutz.

3378
05:14:25,990 --> 05:14:29,433
So dropped a little bit to hopefully get just a little bit more than her first lift.

3379
05:14:40,840 --> 05:14:41,882
That's good for Gluck.

3380
05:14:42,743 --> 05:14:50,712
It's the fourth heaviest lift we've had so far after one heat.

3381
05:14:52,094 --> 05:14:54,176
As Gracie Walton goes for 315.

3382
05:14:54,237 --> 05:14:54,817
And she gets it.

3383
05:14:59,312 --> 05:15:00,773
You talk about that unique sticking point.

3384
05:15:00,813 --> 05:15:01,754
We almost saw one there.

3385
05:15:01,794 --> 05:15:03,155
That was about to be pretty high.

3386
05:15:03,635 --> 05:15:06,617
She got out of the hole quite a bit before that bar started to slow.

3387
05:15:06,797 --> 05:15:10,120
I love the post-PR smiles, too, when people just get so excited.

3388
05:15:12,602 --> 05:15:15,844
So Greer will hit .355, which matches Muir.

3389
05:15:15,904 --> 05:15:18,526
But Muir, it appears, has the tiebreaker.

3390
05:15:19,206 --> 05:15:20,287
What was her first attempt?

3391
05:15:20,407 --> 05:15:20,908
Going in.

3392
05:15:22,217 --> 05:15:25,439
It was Brooke Wells with 330 pounds.

3393
05:15:25,499 --> 05:15:28,620
Now, she's got a best lift listed at 345.

3394
05:15:28,740 --> 05:15:36,764
But this is her 10th year at the CrossFit Games to be hitting these submaximal loads after a 6K run, or six miles of running and everything else.

3395
05:15:37,105 --> 05:15:38,145
Extremely impressive.

3396
05:15:38,525 --> 05:15:44,709
And then it was Anika Greer who gave us not even the closest thing to a smile, only a growl after an easy 355.

3397
05:15:45,249 --> 05:15:50,011
She's simply looking at that weight saying, I should have bested you by another 10 pounds at least.

3398
05:15:50,091 --> 05:15:50,912
Anika Greer.

3399
05:15:51,512 --> 05:15:56,654
We'll take the heat for heat number two, Brooke Wells, second at 330.

3400
05:15:58,154 --> 05:16:00,515
We have one more heat to go.

3401
05:16:00,755 --> 05:16:02,135
Alex, thank you so much.

3402
05:16:02,735 --> 05:16:03,636
Please heal up.

3403
05:16:03,676 --> 05:16:07,097
We want to see you back here at the CrossFit Games next year.

3404
05:16:07,117 --> 05:16:08,417
Thank you for joining us.

3405
05:16:08,637 --> 05:16:09,037
Absolutely.

3406
05:16:09,057 --> 05:16:09,397
Thank you.

3407
05:16:09,937 --> 05:16:11,698
One more heat remains.

3408
05:16:44,983 --> 05:16:46,090
yeah yeah

3409
05:17:14,033 --> 05:17:18,894
The 2025 CrossFit Games have descended upon Albany, New York.

3410
05:17:18,975 --> 05:17:21,075
We are inside MVP Arena.

3411
05:17:21,775 --> 05:17:26,897
As you're getting set for the final heat for individual event number five for the women, I'm Chase Ingram.

3412
05:17:26,957 --> 05:17:28,717
Along with me is Adrienne Conway.

3413
05:17:29,358 --> 05:17:31,958
Mike Arsenault will join us shortly from the floor.

3414
05:17:36,100 --> 05:17:37,260
One rep max.

3415
05:17:40,445 --> 05:17:42,967
Don't weaken moment of the day, and what a moment it was.

3416
05:17:43,007 --> 05:17:46,229
We haven't seen anything like this in a very long time.

3417
05:17:46,269 --> 05:18:04,183
Tia Claire Toomey was holding on to the leader jersey, but Lucy Campbell, who has a knack for taking down champs, in the final 150 feet, Lucy Campbell, who was tied for second in points,

3418
05:18:06,067 --> 05:18:10,490
Back for the first time since 2022, gets an event win.

3419
05:18:10,510 --> 05:18:20,657
And for the first time in her career, will be donning the leader jersey over Tia Claire Toomey, just two points back.

3420
05:18:20,757 --> 05:18:23,879
Lydia Fish still holding on that third place spot.

3421
05:18:25,921 --> 05:18:31,245
Event number five, one rep max back squat presented by Lu Zhangjun.

3422
05:18:32,688 --> 05:18:35,649
Adrian, what is your tempo recipe for success?

3423
05:18:36,209 --> 05:18:38,010
We've watched this play out a few times.

3424
05:18:38,710 --> 05:18:40,030
They need to know their squat chase.

3425
05:18:40,050 --> 05:18:47,633
They're either going to use a high bar back squat, high on their traps, or a low bar back squat, where they get that bar as low as they can on their back and really lean forward.

3426
05:18:47,993 --> 05:18:49,173
But they've got to start sharp.

3427
05:18:49,294 --> 05:18:53,815
We've seen athletes miss that opening attempt, and it's done nothing but hurt their momentum for lifts two and three.

3428
05:18:53,835 --> 05:18:59,397
I mean, leaning into it, Lydia Fish, who's sitting in third overall, wearing the fish head.

3429
05:19:02,035 --> 05:19:07,580
You're laying assignments for this third and final heat after four events.

3430
05:19:09,762 --> 05:19:13,645
So we'll go from 10th to first in order.

3431
05:19:13,665 --> 05:19:15,507
And we'll kick things off.

3432
05:19:16,588 --> 05:19:20,051
with Miriam von Rohr in lane number one.

3433
05:19:20,451 --> 05:19:22,373
More on her, let's go down to Mike Arsenault.

3434
05:19:22,773 --> 05:19:26,657
Well, Chase, Miriam's one of the strongest athletes in the field and also the most secretive.

3435
05:19:26,797 --> 05:19:32,282
Once this event was announced, she went out of her CrossFit Games profile and deleted all of her numbers to keep her

3436
05:19:32,822 --> 05:19:53,719
numbers secret from the rest of the field and even in the warm-up area asked her and her coach what are her goal weights for this they looked around brought out a sheet of paper with all different permutations of what she might attain and I asked well what would a PR be and I was just told around 365 however I did notice a 385 on that sheet as well so we'll see if a hundred points are in her future.

3437
05:19:53,739 --> 05:20:01,285
Olivia Kerstetter back for the second time no stranger to heavy lifts at the CrossFit Games.

3438
05:20:05,656 --> 05:20:11,399
Van Roer back-to-back CrossFit open worldwide winner.

3439
05:20:13,320 --> 05:20:15,821
Setting up with 325 to kick things off.

3440
05:20:17,102 --> 05:20:17,562
Okay.

3441
05:20:17,962 --> 05:20:18,862
All right.

3442
05:20:19,883 --> 05:20:23,424
Almost an akin execution to what we saw from Mr. Mertens on the men's side.

3443
05:20:23,465 --> 05:20:25,445
Very vertical torso, pretty narrow stance.

3444
05:20:26,126 --> 05:20:27,226
Clean and strong to start.

3445
05:20:28,847 --> 05:20:29,967
Haley Adams, 260 on a bar.

3446
05:20:32,117 --> 05:20:34,838
Haley currently sitting in ninth overall.

3447
05:20:36,279 --> 05:20:37,380
We'll get her opening lift.

3448
05:20:38,300 --> 05:20:48,845
You said it before, it's that opening round, just knocking the pre-cobwebs off, even after sitting in the corrals for a bit, as Kerstetter has 310 on the bar.

3449
05:20:49,245 --> 05:21:01,011
Yeah, that's part of the gamification of coming to the CrossFit Games, is that you've got to learn strategy that's appropriate to prime you for these max lifts, because you've been standing around for 15 to 20 minutes prior to taking the floor after your warm-up.

3450
05:21:05,195 --> 05:21:07,735
300, opening lift for Maddie Sterk.

3451
05:21:11,976 --> 05:21:20,539
Wow, Sterk sitting in seventh, two points behind sixth, three points back of fifth, five points out of fourth.

3452
05:21:21,039 --> 05:21:28,741
It is getting very tight on the leaderboard as Danielle Brandon has 265 for her opening lift.

3453
05:21:36,214 --> 05:21:36,614
Uh-oh.

3454
05:21:40,636 --> 05:21:42,176
And that's a tough position to be in.

3455
05:21:42,197 --> 05:21:43,717
We talked about starting fast.

3456
05:21:43,757 --> 05:21:48,159
That's where it's better to start too light than too heavy in these situations.

3457
05:21:49,240 --> 05:21:50,240
Amy Kringle going for 275.

3458
05:21:50,541 --> 05:21:58,985
Gets hit for Ariel Lohan.

3459
05:21:59,065 --> 05:22:03,427
Ariel Lohan, as she normally does, sitting in fourth overall.

3460
05:22:05,817 --> 05:22:09,478
and who notoriously does not max out in her training.

3461
05:22:10,518 --> 05:22:13,719
However, she says she saves it for the competition floor.

3462
05:22:14,500 --> 05:22:17,180
And there's a unique mindset that is able to be garnered from Ariel.

3463
05:22:17,220 --> 05:22:18,921
She has like this lightheartedness to her.

3464
05:22:18,961 --> 05:22:20,321
Now she's out for blood, don't get it wrong.

3465
05:22:20,341 --> 05:22:27,824
She comes to win, but she just rolls with the punches so well that it's not a surprise to see her optimize her potential at the CrossFit Games.

3466
05:22:27,884 --> 05:22:30,924
Lydia Fish, third overall, 265, looks very good for Lydia.

3467
05:22:34,679 --> 05:22:41,281
Biggest knock on her coming in is the strength, as you see the fish head fans with her family, huge family.

3468
05:22:42,561 --> 05:22:43,782
Three brothers, one sister.

3469
05:22:44,862 --> 05:22:45,802
Tia Claire Toomey.

3470
05:22:46,983 --> 05:22:58,086
We have not seen someone take the leader jersey from her in competition since the second event of the 2019 CrossFit Games.

3471
05:23:02,188 --> 05:23:02,988
Lucy Campbell.

3472
05:23:03,992 --> 05:23:07,653
Donning the red and the white for the first time in her career.

3473
05:23:08,953 --> 05:23:09,713
Opening up at 285.

3474
05:23:10,353 --> 05:23:15,934
285 is good for Campbell.

3475
05:23:16,174 --> 05:23:16,694
Looks great.

3476
05:23:17,734 --> 05:23:19,115
Good clean opening lift right there.

3477
05:23:19,135 --> 05:23:20,155
That's how you build confidence.

3478
05:23:20,355 --> 05:23:22,895
Round one is done as we move to round number four.

3479
05:23:22,955 --> 05:23:24,476
340 on the bar.

3480
05:23:24,496 --> 05:23:24,556
Yep.

3481
05:23:26,656 --> 05:23:28,516
For Miriam Von Rohr.

3482
05:23:28,616 --> 05:23:31,277
Her 325 is already good for fifth in the event.

3483
05:23:35,504 --> 05:23:36,044
Yep, yep.

3484
05:23:36,084 --> 05:23:37,065
She's priming herself, Chase.

3485
05:23:37,105 --> 05:23:41,788
That was a great number for her to say, OK, this is where I'm going to pivot, or I need to go this way or that way.

3486
05:23:41,888 --> 05:23:44,389
Now she's eyeing, what's the best score right now on the leaderboard?

3487
05:23:44,409 --> 05:23:45,310
I'm going to get that.

3488
05:23:45,330 --> 05:23:46,411
So she had 325.

3489
05:23:46,471 --> 05:23:47,571
We know the best is 355.

3490
05:23:47,872 --> 05:23:50,013
Yep.

3491
05:23:50,033 --> 05:23:52,074
325 to 340 is a 15-pound jump.

3492
05:23:52,194 --> 05:23:55,076
That means she's going to have to jump another 20 if she wants to win.

3493
05:23:55,376 --> 05:23:56,737
But maybe that's not what she's going for.

3494
05:23:56,757 --> 05:24:00,039
Haley, unable to get 270.

3495
05:24:02,380 --> 05:24:04,641
There's something to be said with the way these athletes execute.

3496
05:24:04,661 --> 05:24:12,064
I'd like to see Haley keep her head a little bit more neutral from a coaching perspective to help her stay stable through her midline as she stands through the weight.

3497
05:24:12,385 --> 05:24:13,285
Her setter will get 325.

3498
05:24:13,325 --> 05:24:18,347
340 for Von Rohr is good for a third.

3499
05:24:20,008 --> 05:24:22,609
We have a tie in weight at 355.

3500
05:24:23,470 --> 05:24:25,311
In your top two spots is Sturt.

3501
05:24:26,911 --> 05:24:27,452
Sets up for 315.

3502
05:24:27,492 --> 05:24:28,532
Now 300 was easy for Maddie.

3503
05:24:33,126 --> 05:24:34,466
Pretty smooth there at 315.

3504
05:24:41,248 --> 05:24:44,429
Daniel Brandon opened at 265 and missed it.

3505
05:24:45,490 --> 05:24:46,870
He's now dropped down to 255.

3506
05:24:47,210 --> 05:24:54,833
That is good for Daniel Brandon.

3507
05:24:55,773 --> 05:24:57,393
OK, so now she's got some weight on the board.

3508
05:24:57,453 --> 05:24:59,174
Now she's in a bit of a pickle.

3509
05:24:59,194 --> 05:25:02,675
This is a harder choice to make now because of that opening missed lift.

3510
05:25:03,889 --> 05:25:07,754
Gringle got 275 in her first attempt, now going for 290.

3511
05:25:14,722 --> 05:25:16,365
290 is good.

3512
05:25:17,266 --> 05:25:21,150
This event's sponsored by Luzhanjun Lifters.

3513
05:25:24,963 --> 05:25:27,684
$3,000 on the line for a win.

3514
05:25:27,704 --> 05:25:30,066
$500 if you wear the lifters.

3515
05:25:30,226 --> 05:25:31,186
Is there a low end?

3516
05:25:31,606 --> 05:25:32,747
You got it.

3517
05:25:32,767 --> 05:25:33,447
Gets $290.

3518
05:25:39,210 --> 05:25:43,112
It's like if you didn't know better, every lift for her is a max effort, like just awesome.

3519
05:25:43,152 --> 05:25:44,692
She's so happy every time.

3520
05:25:44,893 --> 05:25:48,194
Lydia Fish hit $265 nicely as she moves up to $280.

3521
05:25:48,234 --> 05:25:50,855
Very impressive.

3522
05:25:50,875 --> 05:25:52,896
Lydia, hey, girl, get some confidence.

3523
05:25:52,916 --> 05:25:53,817
You look good out there.

3524
05:25:55,131 --> 05:25:56,252
One more lift for Lydia.

3525
05:25:57,213 --> 05:25:59,494
She tries to hold on to that third place position.

3526
05:26:00,635 --> 05:26:04,718
Tia Claire Toomey also going for 325.

3527
05:26:04,778 --> 05:26:11,143
Toomey just two points away from getting that leader jersey back.

3528
05:26:12,704 --> 05:26:15,166
Chase, we know she's focused a lot on endurance.

3529
05:26:15,186 --> 05:26:18,849
She probably wouldn't admit that this is naturally a peak lift for her right now.

3530
05:26:19,389 --> 05:26:21,551
So she's banking on reserves, to be quite honest.

3531
05:26:21,571 --> 05:26:22,391
325 is good.

3532
05:26:24,774 --> 05:26:29,457
And that has Toomey tied for six as Campbell sets up for 295.

3533
05:26:29,938 --> 05:26:35,642
Yep.

3534
05:26:35,942 --> 05:26:38,084
295 is good for Campbell.

3535
05:26:38,104 --> 05:26:40,025
She looks at her judge like, well, we got it.

3536
05:26:42,587 --> 05:26:43,548
Final round.

3537
05:26:43,568 --> 05:26:44,248
Here it is.

3538
05:26:44,268 --> 05:26:44,248
360.

3539
05:26:44,288 --> 05:26:45,589
355.

3540
05:26:44,308 --> 05:26:45,589
We've seen twice.

3541
05:26:53,555 --> 05:26:55,576
360, you only got to do once.

3542
05:26:56,876 --> 05:27:01,657
Mirvan Rohr should take the events.

3543
05:27:01,677 --> 05:27:05,498
265 for Haley.

3544
05:27:05,558 --> 05:27:06,038
Got it.

3545
05:27:06,058 --> 05:27:16,581
265 is good.

3546
05:27:22,835 --> 05:27:24,540
Kerstetter going for 335.

3547
05:27:39,122 --> 05:27:40,203
She tells everyone, I'm good.

3548
05:27:40,383 --> 05:27:40,683
I'm good.

3549
05:27:40,703 --> 05:27:44,746
With the listed max at 320, that would have been well above Olivia's listed previous max.

3550
05:27:45,166 --> 05:27:47,928
We know that's not something that she's necessarily focused on developing.

3551
05:27:48,688 --> 05:27:49,749
But wow, that would have been impressive.

3552
05:27:50,510 --> 05:27:51,790
325 for Maddie Sturt.

3553
05:27:51,870 --> 05:27:53,812
This is big for her, and she gets it.

3554
05:27:55,413 --> 05:28:01,617
A couple 325s on the board, and that puts her in a tie for sixth.

3555
05:28:06,447 --> 05:28:10,910
265, this is what Daniel Brannan missed on her opening attempt.

3556
05:28:14,853 --> 05:28:16,934
Night and day from lift one to lift three.

3557
05:28:16,955 --> 05:28:23,919
Amy Kringle rocking the Liu Zhang shoes.

3558
05:28:23,939 --> 05:28:29,743
If you're looking for a serious upgrade in your lifts, save 15% on the Liu Zhang shoes.

3559
05:28:30,424 --> 05:28:31,465
Scan the QR code now.

3560
05:28:32,628 --> 05:28:35,791
We'll head to liujianju.com and grab you a pair.

3561
05:28:36,031 --> 05:28:38,794
And that pair of shoes paid off for Kringle.

3562
05:28:38,814 --> 05:28:39,234
That's right.

3563
05:28:39,535 --> 05:28:42,718
And she's got $300 in the bag and $500 for wearing the shoes.

3564
05:28:43,618 --> 05:28:45,120
And she looked surprised that it went down.

3565
05:28:45,140 --> 05:28:47,782
So $300 is a solid number for Amy Kringle.

3566
05:28:47,802 --> 05:28:50,285
$295 for Ariel Lohan, who's sitting in fourth.

3567
05:28:59,696 --> 05:29:03,538
Really close, almost had it, started to shift a little to her right, decided to let it go.

3568
05:29:03,558 --> 05:29:04,919
Probably a wise choice.

3569
05:29:04,939 --> 05:29:05,840
Fish hit 280.

3570
05:29:06,140 --> 05:29:07,901
She's got 290 on the bar.

3571
05:29:07,941 --> 05:29:12,684
That would tie her with Lohan, who's trying to chase her down for third place solely.

3572
05:29:13,545 --> 05:29:15,546
And she's not able to get it.

3573
05:29:15,606 --> 05:29:17,727
So 280 for Lydia Fish.

3574
05:29:20,169 --> 05:29:21,170
Tia Claire Toomey for 335.

3575
05:29:24,088 --> 05:29:27,070
And she'll get her into fourth if she can hit it.

3576
05:29:27,090 --> 05:29:28,410
This is a big squat for Tia.

3577
05:29:32,593 --> 05:29:36,455
This is going to tie a previous best in 2020 if she hits it.

3578
05:29:36,875 --> 05:29:38,716
And she does.

3579
05:29:38,736 --> 05:29:41,317
335, looking very good for Tia Clare.

3580
05:29:43,318 --> 05:29:45,439
As Lucy Campbell setting up for 305.

3581
05:29:46,060 --> 05:29:46,800
Tia looking over.

3582
05:29:55,073 --> 05:30:01,816
305.

3583
05:29:55,153 --> 05:30:01,816
Wow.

3584
05:30:02,957 --> 05:30:04,618
Miriam von Rohr.

3585
05:30:08,479 --> 05:30:09,780
We're wondering if we're going to see it.

3586
05:30:11,421 --> 05:30:12,581
And we got what we came for, 360.

3587
05:30:12,621 --> 05:30:13,462
We'll take the event.

3588
05:30:17,413 --> 05:30:20,195
Let's take a look at your highlights presented by Rogue.

3589
05:30:20,536 --> 05:30:22,457
Hey, we had some impressive lifts all around.

3590
05:30:22,517 --> 05:30:27,361
Olivia Kerstetter, one of the younger athletes in the field with a listed max of 320.

3591
05:30:27,701 --> 05:30:29,643
She smoked 325.

3592
05:30:31,405 --> 05:30:36,489
We also had Maddie Sturt, who made an amazing three lift performance.

3593
05:30:36,849 --> 05:30:42,193
She was sharp early, but then she was able to come through all the way here to 325 at the end.

3594
05:30:42,714 --> 05:30:46,357
And it looked like she was close to that threshold, but there still might have been another five pounds in the tank.

3595
05:30:48,800 --> 05:30:54,104
Tia matching a 2020 CrossFit Games performance here at 335 pounds.

3596
05:30:54,464 --> 05:31:01,809
All the more impressive when we know that most of this year was spent focused on endurance and running, and she's still able to rise to the occasion here at the CrossFit Games.

3597
05:31:02,069 --> 05:31:04,011
She wants that white and red jersey back.

3598
05:31:04,751 --> 05:31:07,513
And then Miram Von Rohr, welcome to the CrossFit Games.

3599
05:31:07,533 --> 05:31:16,119
The two-time Open champion has now made it to compete in person, and she's putting on a show with 360 pounds on a back squat.

3600
05:31:16,499 --> 05:31:17,180
So impressive.

3601
05:31:18,996 --> 05:31:29,383
Your Event 5 results, Mirim Van Roer sits on top at 360 pounds, followed by Annika Greer and Jen Muir.

3602
05:31:31,204 --> 05:31:37,549
And as you said, your two-time Open champ, now the champ of Event 5, she's down with Mike Arsenault.

3603
05:31:38,348 --> 05:31:40,269
Okay, Miriam, we talked before this event.

3604
05:31:40,349 --> 05:31:43,170
You wouldn't tell me what your PR was in the back squat.

3605
05:31:43,230 --> 05:31:48,792
You deleted your profile before this event to keep your stats a secret to the rest of the competitors.

3606
05:31:49,272 --> 05:31:50,453
You hit 360.

3607
05:31:50,873 --> 05:31:52,374
What is your PR in the back squat?

3608
05:31:53,674 --> 05:31:56,335
My PR is 165 kilogram.

3609
05:31:56,675 --> 05:31:58,536
I don't know this exactly in pounds.

3610
05:31:58,756 --> 05:32:00,377
It's maybe around 360, 365 pounds.

3611
05:32:03,515 --> 05:32:06,256
My math is correct, it's right around 365 pounds.

3612
05:32:06,596 --> 05:32:08,297
You're a two-time Open winner.

3613
05:32:08,697 --> 05:32:11,258
This is your first time at the CrossFit Games.

3614
05:32:11,618 --> 05:32:15,199
You just won an event, 100 points, competing in front of thousands of fans.

3615
05:32:15,679 --> 05:32:17,300
What is this experience like for you?

3616
05:32:18,120 --> 05:32:21,901
Yes, it's a very different experience.

3617
05:32:22,221 --> 05:32:26,203
I was never in a so big competition, and it's a very great feeling.

3618
05:32:26,683 --> 05:32:29,504
Well, congratulations, great performance, and we'll see you later today.

3619
05:32:29,524 --> 05:32:30,244
Thank you.

3620
05:32:32,308 --> 05:32:40,291
Congratulations to Miriam von Rohr, gets her very first event win at her very first CrossFit Games.

3621
05:32:42,012 --> 05:32:44,393
That'll do it for individual event five.

3622
05:32:44,893 --> 05:32:45,754
Don't go anywhere.

3623
05:32:46,074 --> 05:32:50,396
The teams are next, and the individuals will finish the night off.

3624
05:32:51,536 --> 05:32:53,937
Individual event number nine is eight, five is done.

3625
05:32:53,977 --> 05:32:56,738
For agent Conway and Mike Carson, I'm Chase Ingram.

3626
05:32:57,218 --> 05:32:58,299
Teams coming up next.

3627
05:36:45,305 --> 05:36:45,505
you

3628
05:40:00,660 --> 05:40:01,441
Music Music

3629
05:42:01,408 --> 05:42:02,119
just fine.

3630
05:42:04,853 --> 05:42:11,475
It's the 20, 25 CrossFit games from MVP arena here in Albany, New York, the home of this Sienna saints.

3631
05:42:11,555 --> 05:42:15,176
And our coverage today brought to us by Valitas.

3632
05:42:15,656 --> 05:42:18,697
We are really tests and we are made not born.

3633
05:42:19,317 --> 05:42:22,658
Bethany Flores has been to the CrossFit games seven times.

3634
05:42:22,738 --> 05:42:25,298
Bella Martin down on the floor, Joel go debt.

3635
05:42:25,338 --> 05:42:28,299
Glad to have you along with us for team event.

3636
05:42:28,399 --> 05:42:31,800
Number six, the one rep max backs to squat.

3637
05:42:32,580 --> 05:42:42,303
After five events, Butcher's Lab, a group of three-team CrossFit Games rookies, is in first place by 10 over the veteran CrossFit Oslo crew.

3638
05:42:42,343 --> 05:42:49,684
And then Campbell City, who came into the day wearing the leader's jersey, taking a 30-point tumble from a 15-point lead to a 15-point deficit.

3639
05:42:55,323 --> 05:42:56,564
or one rep max back squat.

3640
05:42:57,384 --> 05:42:57,725
That's it.

3641
05:42:57,785 --> 05:43:00,407
That's the event description brought to us by Lu Xiaojun.

3642
05:43:00,427 --> 05:43:01,968
Yeah, it's pretty simple.

3643
05:43:02,028 --> 05:43:05,470
You have five minutes for the women, five minutes for the men, all in a day.

3644
05:43:05,910 --> 05:43:09,673
As many reps as you can get to get a max in that five minute window.

3645
05:43:10,193 --> 05:43:10,974
Let's go down to Bellarmore.

3646
05:43:11,992 --> 05:43:14,714
Let's talk about balance of tests here today.

3647
05:43:14,774 --> 05:43:17,536
We saw the team communication earlier this morning.

3648
05:43:17,557 --> 05:43:21,440
Now we have whatever these team individuals want to do on their own.

3649
05:43:21,780 --> 05:43:26,123
And the best part is, it's a direct comparison to what the individuals are doing.

3650
05:43:26,284 --> 05:43:33,689
Not often do we see two tests in a games weekend, where the team athletes can compare what the individuals did and see kind of how they stack up.

3651
05:43:34,030 --> 05:43:39,434
Something that's even more fun for this one, if the teams are wearing the luge out jeans, they can walk away with $500.

3652
05:43:40,635 --> 05:43:42,778
just for wearing the shoes for one single lift.

3653
05:43:43,179 --> 05:43:44,941
Tell you what, that's pretty worth it, and that's why I'm wearing them.

3654
05:43:46,343 --> 05:43:47,845
Bella Martin does have them on.

3655
05:43:48,165 --> 05:43:48,846
We're trying to get her the $500.

3656
05:43:49,006 --> 05:43:51,049
She's just got to get a back squat in.

3657
05:43:51,814 --> 05:43:53,795
We've got 10 teams in this opening heat.

3658
05:43:54,396 --> 05:43:58,459
CrossFit Prostanda in lane five, the Swedish super team.

3659
05:43:59,139 --> 05:44:02,342
CrossFit 1124 has had a couple of good events back to back.

3660
05:44:02,762 --> 05:44:05,524
They will be our last lifters in this group in lane 10.

3661
05:44:06,585 --> 05:44:12,810
But our Vision Fuels victory athletes to watch come from Camp Rhino CrossFit in lane six.

3662
05:44:13,550 --> 05:44:20,513
Interesting team, made up of athletes born in four different countries, including Nikita Yandov, who has the bunned blonde hair in the back.

3663
05:44:20,553 --> 05:44:23,254
He's an individual semi-finalist from when he lived back in Europe.

3664
05:44:23,654 --> 05:44:27,415
Went team when he moved to the US a couple of years ago from Belarus.

3665
05:44:27,795 --> 05:44:30,636
That's a country that borders both Ukraine and Russia.

3666
05:44:31,176 --> 05:44:34,458
Obviously a lot of geopolitical implications there.

3667
05:44:34,478 --> 05:44:37,279
It was a very difficult transition for him, a lot of sleepless nights.

3668
05:44:37,699 --> 05:44:40,860
He's very close with 2019 Ukrainian CrossFit Games

3669
05:44:41,700 --> 05:44:45,886
well, Ukrainian champion and CrossFit Games competitor Oleksandr Shularenko.

3670
05:44:46,266 --> 05:44:52,575
He's currently serving in the war, and he said, I feel kind of silly sometimes doing CrossFit when he's out there in tanks.

3671
05:44:53,116 --> 05:44:53,957
They still communicate.

3672
05:44:54,217 --> 05:44:55,038
They still text.

3673
05:44:55,419 --> 05:44:58,824
He has Oleksandr's full support from halfway across the globe.

3674
05:45:02,869 --> 05:45:05,110
Here we go for a one rep next back squat.

3675
05:45:05,450 --> 05:45:09,270
Rebecca Divine is going to open at 365.

3676
05:45:10,211 --> 05:45:16,972
If she hits this, it is the single best lift, and it's the easiest darn thing you've seen from a female competitor today.

3677
05:45:17,052 --> 05:45:18,152
That was way too simple.

3678
05:45:18,232 --> 05:45:19,953
She went up and down way too fast.

3679
05:45:19,973 --> 05:45:23,013
That means that weight is too light, way too light for her.

3680
05:45:23,513 --> 05:45:25,554
That just won the women's individual.

3681
05:45:25,574 --> 05:45:28,915
She's got to switch over now.

3682
05:45:28,935 --> 05:45:30,975
What did we just do for the last hour?

3683
05:45:32,825 --> 05:45:37,006
265.

3684
05:45:32,945 --> 05:45:37,006
Up and easy there for four friends.

3685
05:45:38,226 --> 05:45:40,666
And 11.24 is meat nugget Jessica Androsik.

3686
05:45:42,067 --> 05:45:43,627
Successful giving way to Sydney.

3687
05:45:45,207 --> 05:45:46,407
The slender tender.

3688
05:45:48,308 --> 05:45:50,688
Now one of the other strongest women in CrossFit.

3689
05:45:51,708 --> 05:45:54,309
That's the former Christine Middleton, Christine Zanosko.

3690
05:45:55,189 --> 05:45:55,929
Good at 305.

3691
05:45:57,049 --> 05:45:59,910
She holds the clean and jerk record in CrossFit competition.

3692
05:46:02,677 --> 05:46:05,280
All right, what's key to a one-rep max back squat?

3693
05:46:05,360 --> 05:46:08,403
I know it's not the Bethany Flores specialty, but what are you doing?

3694
05:46:08,423 --> 05:46:09,584
It definitely is not.

3695
05:46:09,885 --> 05:46:11,326
This would not be a good one for me.

3696
05:46:11,346 --> 05:46:15,691
I think do a weight that you know that you can do, no matter what.

3697
05:46:16,272 --> 05:46:18,134
Do a weight that you think you can do.

3698
05:46:18,674 --> 05:46:22,198
And then if you have time, do a weight that you hope you can do.

3699
05:46:23,876 --> 05:46:27,059
they should be able to get at least three attempts in, I would say.

3700
05:46:27,519 --> 05:46:32,163
I know the demo team on the guy's side, they got like four or five attempts, but they were moving.

3701
05:46:32,844 --> 05:46:35,526
So it's just gonna depend on the athletes.

3702
05:46:35,607 --> 05:46:42,933
Some of them can lift the same weights, and so that makes it easier when you're transitioning to the next weight, but it kind of just depends on.

3703
05:46:44,083 --> 05:46:46,685
how even you are with your partner on that.

3704
05:46:47,886 --> 05:46:49,567
Your score is your total.

3705
05:46:49,587 --> 05:46:52,409
The total is the total on the left side.

3706
05:46:52,969 --> 05:46:58,493
And then the attempt is on the right.

3707
05:46:58,513 --> 05:47:00,494
11-24, Jessica Androsik for 325.

3708
05:47:00,534 --> 05:47:03,076
Now looking pretty good up there.

3709
05:47:04,177 --> 05:47:05,318
She got a little sticky.

3710
05:47:05,358 --> 05:47:10,181
That means that it's starting to become a little bit heavier for her, but still got it off pretty easily.

3711
05:47:10,201 --> 05:47:11,502
What gets you through the sticking point?

3712
05:47:12,042 --> 05:47:12,963
A little hope.

3713
05:47:17,226 --> 05:47:25,914
No, you have enough temps in practice that you know what you can do and what you can push through, but having a lot of lower body.

3714
05:47:25,934 --> 05:47:25,914
385.

3715
05:47:26,355 --> 05:47:26,995
That's scary.

3716
05:47:27,215 --> 05:47:27,976
Rebecca Divine.

3717
05:47:28,497 --> 05:47:29,137
That's scary.

3718
05:47:29,157 --> 05:47:29,758
20 pound jump.

3719
05:47:29,898 --> 05:47:34,862
And do you see how easy that was?

3720
05:47:36,184 --> 05:47:37,305
She's told us.

3721
05:47:37,325 --> 05:47:38,466
400 plus?

3722
05:47:38,606 --> 05:47:39,427
Her goal was 410.

3723
05:47:41,621 --> 05:47:45,625
She's going to get a crack at it here with still half the time remaining.

3724
05:47:46,185 --> 05:47:51,711
There's athletes doing 260, and I'm pretty sure she made that look a lot easier than someone's 260.

3725
05:47:51,751 --> 05:47:57,697
Bethany, how do you game plan this?

3726
05:47:57,717 --> 05:48:01,781
Do you take bigger jumps early, or do you take bigger jumps late?

3727
05:48:03,026 --> 05:48:12,209
I would do bigger jumps at the beginning because you're doing something that you know that you can do right at the beginning and then something that you think you can do and that's the time to take a bigger jump.

3728
05:48:12,289 --> 05:48:21,933
A lot of discussions still going on on the floor and one of the things to think about

3729
05:48:23,471 --> 05:48:25,352
I mean, that's body blueprint, that's a team from New York.

3730
05:48:25,693 --> 05:48:28,995
But I was gonna say, one of the things to think about is what weight is on the bar.

3731
05:48:29,555 --> 05:48:35,419
And we were talking to Butcher's Lab beforehand, and Drosik is good at 335, because they work out lifting kilos.

3732
05:48:36,320 --> 05:48:41,924
But Pernila Christensen said, listen, sometimes it's easier when you can't do the math and you don't know what's on the bar, just go lift.

3733
05:48:42,124 --> 05:48:47,628
Yeah, she also said that she writes it down on her arm with the colors, which is not a bad idea.

3734
05:48:48,269 --> 05:48:50,030
Two reds, one yellow, three blues, let's go.

3735
05:48:51,089 --> 05:48:53,711
That's what the Americans do when we go over to Europe.

3736
05:48:55,272 --> 05:48:57,334
This is Jordan Adcock, and there's confusion right now.

3737
05:48:57,374 --> 05:48:58,835
There's some yelling going on down there.

3738
05:49:00,636 --> 05:49:02,758
You can just hear Adcock yelling, what's on the bar?

3739
05:49:04,739 --> 05:49:06,580
We've got a minute left to go, and that's costly.

3740
05:49:06,601 --> 05:49:07,141
335 for Adcock.

3741
05:49:07,201 --> 05:49:08,282
Oh, excuse me, for Torresllana.

3742
05:49:17,244 --> 05:49:20,445
You can see that her knee came in just a little bit on that left side.

3743
05:49:20,846 --> 05:49:25,668
That just means that probably one left glute is a little bit weaker than her right.

3744
05:49:26,248 --> 05:49:28,409
How about Rebecca Devine just taking a seat in the back?

3745
05:49:29,089 --> 05:49:29,569
Good for her.

3746
05:49:30,290 --> 05:49:31,090
Sometimes that's good.

3747
05:49:31,230 --> 05:49:38,953
Like a lot of lifters, good lifters, they will sit between each rep just to get as much rest as possible throughout their body.

3748
05:49:39,574 --> 05:49:41,614
Devine is going to go for 400.

3749
05:49:41,654 --> 05:49:45,036
She has to get the bar off the rack before five minutes.

3750
05:49:46,996 --> 05:49:47,857
After that, she's good to go.

3751
05:49:48,517 --> 05:49:48,897
Prostanda.

3752
05:49:48,917 --> 05:49:52,020
Nice lift.

3753
05:49:52,220 --> 05:49:52,480
Good.

3754
05:49:53,381 --> 05:49:56,803
Now, here goes Divine for 400 pounds.

3755
05:49:57,144 --> 05:50:01,026
See how easy she makes this look.

3756
05:50:03,048 --> 05:50:04,269
Oh, and she got stuck.

3757
05:50:05,767 --> 05:50:11,029
But still the single best female total by Rebecca Divine.

3758
05:50:11,189 --> 05:50:12,609
Christine Best with 350.

3759
05:50:12,749 --> 05:50:14,510
That was actually a really good lift as well.

3760
05:50:14,690 --> 05:50:16,751
And we are now in the second five minutes.

3761
05:50:16,811 --> 05:50:18,291
There is no reset.

3762
05:50:19,032 --> 05:50:23,613
So this time is ticking, and the guys for undivided will immediately put two reds on.

3763
05:50:23,933 --> 05:50:26,094
CrossFit 4 is on the left there, Griffin Raleigh.

3764
05:50:26,114 --> 05:50:28,835
He's going to, we would think, put up some big numbers.

3765
05:50:29,055 --> 05:50:30,896
We also know his back bugged him a little bit yesterday.

3766
05:50:33,324 --> 05:50:39,549
Interesting note too, the guys have to lift from where the girls were on the J-hooks, which makes it a little bit harder.

3767
05:50:39,970 --> 05:50:48,537
They're having to squat underneath that bar to even get it off the rack, which that's not fun for them, especially when it gets to PRs and heavy, heavy lifts.

3768
05:50:49,398 --> 05:50:50,739
Scores are at the top of your screen.

3769
05:50:50,759 --> 05:50:54,182
They're going to be a little bit off until everybody gets one lift in the books.

3770
05:50:55,063 --> 05:50:56,804
But for now, CrossFit Body Blueprint.

3771
05:50:57,425 --> 05:50:58,866
Now Q21 back up front at 1460.

3772
05:51:01,240 --> 05:51:04,282
Crosby Henderson and Hendersonville had an interesting way of squatting.

3773
05:51:04,342 --> 05:51:06,883
He was actually looking straight down when he was squatting.

3774
05:51:08,064 --> 05:51:08,905
Wouldn't recommend that.

3775
05:51:09,705 --> 05:51:13,147
Joe Piero, good with the reds on the outside.

3776
05:51:15,629 --> 05:51:19,771
Yeah, those are a better way of squatting, just having your eyes look straight forward.

3777
05:51:19,791 --> 05:51:25,454
And you'll actually see some people have their eyes looking up or their head popping up, too, when he gets heavier.

3778
05:51:25,555 --> 05:51:28,076
Easy money for Alexander Alebro.

3779
05:51:31,643 --> 05:51:35,564
Really good 365 attempt as well from Wes Peters out of Hendersonville.

3780
05:51:35,684 --> 05:51:37,264
And now here is Thor at 495.

3781
05:51:37,464 --> 05:51:43,146
571 for Colton Mertens on the individual side earlier.

3782
05:51:43,186 --> 05:51:43,966
Wide squatter.

3783
05:51:44,826 --> 05:51:45,626
Wide squatter.

3784
05:51:45,726 --> 05:51:50,608
Probably just feels more comfortable on the hips and the legs.

3785
05:51:51,968 --> 05:51:52,368
Rapp with 475.

3786
05:51:52,408 --> 05:51:56,109
For Camp Rhino.

3787
05:51:56,469 --> 05:51:57,469
Deceptively strong.

3788
05:51:58,309 --> 05:51:59,210
He's very strong.

3789
05:52:00,370 --> 05:52:00,550
Yeah.

3790
05:52:02,016 --> 05:52:04,638
Don't let him fool you with the size.

3791
05:52:05,238 --> 05:52:08,100
He is super strong.

3792
05:52:08,120 --> 05:52:09,040
4.55 by Mike Needleman.

3793
05:52:09,120 --> 05:52:18,946
And Undivided is looking to put up some big numbers, trying to recover, because that total on the left is low between Christine Best and Christine Zanosko.

3794
05:52:18,966 --> 05:52:22,228
So unless that number has not been updated.

3795
05:52:22,248 --> 05:52:25,029
They have a 4.95 going on.

3796
05:52:25,089 --> 05:52:26,510
No, they're now at 16.50.

3797
05:52:27,250 --> 05:52:29,091
So that counter just is off.

3798
05:52:29,111 --> 05:52:30,072
Undivided's in the lead.

3799
05:52:36,638 --> 05:52:58,733
Four is getting ready to go at 525 as a Lebro is good Josh Hong for 495 one of the fittest Koreans on earth And Yeah, Raleigh hit

3800
05:53:00,153 --> 05:53:01,114
So Undivided's now at 16.80.

3801
05:53:01,274 --> 05:53:12,125
If you're putting up a team total that is higher than the year the New World was discovered, you're having a great day.

3802
05:53:13,025 --> 05:53:14,887
Yeah, having a really good day.

3803
05:53:15,808 --> 05:53:16,469
Gotta take your wins.

05:53:24,227 --> 05:53:27,228

3806
05:53:32,490 --> 05:53:41,054
Tyler, Riley Good, rather, from 1124, gonna push them over 1600, if he can hit 490.

3807
05:53:41,094 --> 05:53:42,154
Griffin Riley is about to go again.

3808
05:53:51,093 --> 05:53:53,395
a former football player at Valdosta State.

3809
05:53:53,435 --> 05:53:55,037
He was always on the bigger side.

3810
05:53:55,057 --> 05:53:57,760
One of his gym members said, you look like Thor.

3811
05:53:57,780 --> 05:53:57,800
5'40"?

3812
05:53:57,880 --> 05:53:58,841
He lifts like Thor.

3813
05:53:58,861 --> 05:53:59,121
Oh my gosh.

3814
05:53:59,602 --> 05:54:00,303
5'40", looks like 2'20".

3815
05:54:06,104 --> 05:54:08,245
Can we just talk about how easy that looked?

3816
05:54:08,625 --> 05:54:13,127
He's got another minute, and we just got a fail at a Joe Piero.

3817
05:54:13,667 --> 05:54:16,648
We're going to see if Griffin Raleigh is going to get another lift in.

3818
05:54:17,488 --> 05:54:21,250
And now it's going to be a real fast re-rack for Body Blueprint and Piero.

3819
05:54:21,710 --> 05:54:22,910
That fail was a little scary.

3820
05:54:23,070 --> 05:54:28,872
Going forward is usually not the way they should fail, so to see that could lead into some scary injuries.

3821
05:54:28,932 --> 05:54:30,533
We need to be careful with that.

3822
05:54:30,573 --> 05:54:31,613
Hung, going to go for better than 520.

3823
05:54:31,713 --> 05:54:31,994
Raleigh.

3824
05:54:36,028 --> 05:54:41,432
540 was the last attempt, we'll see what he goes for now.

3825
05:54:41,452 --> 05:54:45,536
20 seconds left, you gotta milk all this rest.

3826
05:54:46,536 --> 05:54:47,697
Hong, 505 on the right.

3827
05:54:47,717 --> 05:54:55,084
565 for Griffin Raleigh, this will put him second overall.

3828
05:54:59,753 --> 05:55:04,700
individuals and teams and it is absolutely fantastic.

3829
05:55:05,001 --> 05:55:07,745
Griffin Raleigh at 565.

3830
05:55:10,549 --> 05:55:15,697
Ain't No Doubt came to play and Undivided has a phenomenal showing.

3831
05:55:16,973 --> 05:55:17,794
which that's what they said.

3832
05:55:17,874 --> 05:55:19,555
They said that to us yesterday.

3833
05:55:20,175 --> 05:55:21,997
They said this was gonna be a good event for them.

3834
05:55:22,137 --> 05:55:24,359
And Griffin Raleigh just said, should've gone up.

3835
05:55:24,639 --> 05:55:25,239
Should've done more.

3836
05:55:25,820 --> 05:55:27,081
Five minutes isn't a lot of time.

3837
05:55:27,241 --> 05:55:27,741
But you know what?

3838
05:55:27,841 --> 05:55:29,923
I would rather feel like I could've done more.

3839
05:55:30,383 --> 05:55:30,664
Yeah.

3840
05:55:30,704 --> 05:55:31,124
Than miss the one.

3841
05:55:32,085 --> 05:55:32,445
Correct.

3842
05:55:33,846 --> 05:55:37,529
You wanna end on a good note, so that's gonna make him feel really good going into day three. 17.35.

3843
05:55:42,660 --> 05:55:46,682
Well, here we are with some crazy numbers with the ladies with Rebecca divine.

3844
05:55:47,262 --> 05:55:48,103
She hit.

3845
05:55:49,504 --> 05:55:54,827
So much weight compared to some of the ladies on the floor and just making it look so easy.

3846
05:55:54,847 --> 05:55:57,488
385 what in the world?

3847
05:55:58,609 --> 05:56:06,473
She's pretty happy about that and then we had Griffin on the other side like CrossFit undivided 565 like come on.

3848
05:56:06,573 --> 05:56:08,494
How easy is that?

3849
05:56:10,247 --> 05:56:11,428
And he was pretty happy about that.

3850
05:56:11,508 --> 05:56:13,189
And even saying, I hope that I do more.

3851
05:56:15,450 --> 05:56:16,951
They win the heat by more than 100 pounds.

3852
05:56:17,692 --> 05:56:19,733
No big deal.

3853
05:56:19,753 --> 05:56:21,855
16.15 out of 11.24, who's coming on strong.

3854
05:56:21,875 --> 05:56:26,978
They may work their way into the second heat to start the final day off tomorrow.

3855
05:56:27,018 --> 05:56:31,181
And then 16.05 for Body Blueprint on Bryce Broome's 30th birthday.

3856
05:56:31,241 --> 05:56:32,502
Training Think Tank puts up 15.90.

3857
05:56:38,258 --> 05:56:43,107
We've got one more heat coming up for the teams on Saturday.

3858
05:57:06,748 --> 05:57:11,991
final event, final heat for the teams here at the 2025 CrossFit Games on moving day.

3859
05:57:12,471 --> 05:57:14,952
MVP arena, downtown Albany, New York.

3860
05:57:15,612 --> 05:57:18,013
Today we are sponsored by Velites.

3861
05:57:18,434 --> 05:57:19,354
We are Velites.

3862
05:57:19,914 --> 05:57:22,236
We are made, not born.

3863
05:57:23,656 --> 05:57:29,999
Alongside Bethany Flores, a seven-times CrossFit Games athlete, Bella Martin is down on the floor.

3864
05:57:30,039 --> 05:57:31,200
My name is Joel Gaudette.

3865
05:57:33,168 --> 05:57:37,732
For the first time in competition, Butcher's Lab is your leader.

3866
05:57:37,752 --> 05:57:40,734
10 point advantage over CrossFit Oslo.

3867
05:57:40,774 --> 05:57:43,957
We see a 30 point swing with Camel City CrossFit.

3868
05:57:44,317 --> 05:57:49,401
They went from up 15 to down 15 after event five this morning.

3869
05:57:52,743 --> 05:57:53,984
All right, event description.

3870
05:57:54,344 --> 05:57:56,785
This is the easiest event description.

3871
05:57:56,865 --> 05:57:58,366
I mean, back squat.

3872
05:57:58,446 --> 05:58:02,868
The women are going to get five minutes, and they're going to transition straight into the men, and they get another five minutes.

3873
05:58:02,969 --> 05:58:03,689
It's going to go fast.

3874
05:58:04,049 --> 05:58:05,850
Brought to us by Lu Xiaoju.

3875
05:58:05,910 --> 05:58:10,773
As we take a look at our recipe for success, that is delivered to us by Tempo Meals.

3876
05:58:11,474 --> 05:58:13,434
First one is know, think, hope.

3877
05:58:13,674 --> 05:58:19,516
Do something you know you can do, something you think you can do, and then go for something that you hope you can do.

3878
05:58:19,696 --> 05:58:21,536
And the second one is moment to excel.

3879
05:58:22,176 --> 05:58:27,277
The people on day one got their running fun, and now it's time for those heavy lifters to shine.

3880
05:58:27,317 --> 05:58:29,017
So let's see them do some heavy lifts.

3881
05:58:29,438 --> 05:58:29,858
Let's go.

3882
05:58:30,478 --> 05:58:33,298
Our 10th place team will lift first in lane one.

3883
05:58:33,318 --> 05:58:36,219
Our first place team will lift last in lane 10.

3884
05:58:37,802 --> 05:58:45,412
So our standings in reverse on your screen for your lane assignments with Butcher's Lab wearing those white leaders jerseys.

3885
05:58:45,693 --> 05:58:48,256
Let's go down to Bella, who is wearing her Lu Xiaojun's.

3886
05:58:49,449 --> 05:58:51,351
Chatted with Griffin Raleigh just briefly.

3887
05:58:51,371 --> 05:58:53,473
He said if he had more time, he would have gone for 600.

3888
05:58:54,074 --> 05:58:56,977
So that 565, still impressive, but he had more left in the tank.

3889
05:58:57,197 --> 05:59:00,661
But he's not the only guy that's going to hit in that mid 500 range.

3890
05:59:01,101 --> 05:59:06,126
In this heat, I'm looking at that Franco's Imamco team with Jordan and Josh Mattis.

3891
05:59:06,447 --> 05:59:07,828
Both of those guys can hit over 500.

3892
05:59:08,989 --> 05:59:12,011
Jordan's PR is around 505, and you've got Josh at 555.

3893
05:59:12,071 --> 05:59:17,094
So if they have a good day, maybe a couple PRs in there for our men's side of the field.

3894
05:59:17,494 --> 05:59:21,837
But for the women, all eyes on Dani Spiegel, her first year on team.

3895
05:59:21,877 --> 05:59:23,137
Her PR for back squat, 370.

3896
05:59:23,798 --> 05:59:28,260
She'll give Rebecca Divine a run for her money, maybe have the heaviest squat of the day for all the females.

3897
05:59:28,701 --> 05:59:30,622
We'll see in just a couple of seconds, Joel.

3898
05:59:31,971 --> 05:59:32,551
Well, thank you.

3899
05:59:32,611 --> 05:59:33,872
The vision fuels victory.

3900
05:59:34,132 --> 05:59:38,695
Athletes to watch with CrossFit Franco's and CrossFit Invictus.

3901
05:59:39,136 --> 05:59:42,478
But Butcher's Lab right now wearing the white leaders jersey.

3902
05:59:42,838 --> 05:59:46,140
And the question is, how much damage control can you do?

3903
05:59:46,260 --> 05:59:52,765
Pernila Christensen told us earlier, this is not a strength event for them, although she did PR her back squat three days ago.

3904
05:59:53,005 --> 05:59:53,525
Yeah.

3905
05:59:53,545 --> 05:59:54,326
319 was it?

3906
05:59:55,266 --> 05:59:57,708
So we'll see that she I mean, she's starting at 315.

3907
05:59:58,808 --> 05:59:59,389
We'll see what she can do.

3908
06:00:03,492 --> 06:00:04,553
And we are underway.

3909
06:00:05,053 --> 06:00:08,095
Five minutes to lift for all of these competitors.

3910
06:00:08,555 --> 06:00:11,137
Females first, then five minutes for the men.

3911
06:00:12,458 --> 06:00:14,539
And Pernila Christensen, good at 315.

3912
06:00:14,619 --> 06:00:20,663
She basically hit her PR, and that looked super smooth, meaning she's got a lot more in the tank.

3913
06:00:20,683 --> 06:00:23,305
319, by the way, is the ultimate kilo conversion PR.

3914
06:00:26,527 --> 06:00:27,508
Here comes Dani Spiegel.

3915
06:00:30,902 --> 06:00:36,044
Sean Early on the left, Phil Muscarello on the right, being good weight loaders here for their teammate.

3916
06:00:46,529 --> 06:00:48,410
Spiegel opening at 315.

3917
06:00:48,550 --> 06:00:53,533
And I like how Annie, she set the bar before she went down.

3918
06:00:53,713 --> 06:00:58,215
That's how you know that she's a confident lifter, she's ready to go, and she knows that she's going to be able to hit that weight.

3919
06:00:59,741 --> 06:01:06,966
When you see people rush out of the bar and go straight down, they're just hoping that they can get that weight and they're not setting themselves up for success.

3920
06:01:07,006 --> 06:01:12,289
Divine hit 385, so that is the biggest number that the women in this heat are chasing.

3921
06:01:13,950 --> 06:01:19,074
No one has yet gone over 300 with the exception of Spiegel and Christensen.

3922
06:01:21,115 --> 06:01:23,996
Vanila Christensen now going for 325.

3923
06:01:24,936 --> 06:01:34,520
And she breaks through the sticking point for Butcher's Lab off screen, as the 280 will go on up and good for Ava George at a proven.

3924
06:01:36,100 --> 06:01:39,421
And her max is 300, so 280 is going to be a little bit tough for her.

3925
06:01:39,662 --> 06:01:42,342
You saw it was a little sticky, but she still was able to get it up.

3926
06:01:43,003 --> 06:01:44,623
And her partner is going to hit the same weight.

3927
06:01:44,643 --> 06:01:46,744
That means that they're probably around the same one rep max.

3928
06:01:46,764 --> 06:01:48,825
And we'll see how she does in the fifth.

3929
06:01:51,223 --> 06:01:55,849
Same thing, looks pretty good, maybe a little sticky, meaning they're getting closer to that one right now.

3930
06:01:55,989 --> 06:02:01,396
So there's- There's Carson Wolfe, good from Proven, and Emily Rathwell, good from Invictus.

3931
06:02:04,099 --> 06:02:06,942
CrossFit Oslo, Ura Lundqvam.

3932
06:02:10,270 --> 06:02:13,771
And she is through that sticking point.

3933
06:02:13,791 --> 06:02:14,572
That was sticky.

3934
06:02:14,612 --> 06:02:15,232
That was sticky.

3935
06:02:15,252 --> 06:02:18,033
That means that she's getting closer to that one rep max of hers.

3936
06:02:18,233 --> 06:02:24,235
You could tell that she's looking down, so maybe a good idea to look forward or up as she's squatting up.

3937
06:02:25,135 --> 06:02:25,916
335 by Spiegel.

3938
06:02:25,956 --> 06:02:33,798
Let's watch Dani as she gets the bar out of the rack.

3939
06:02:33,838 --> 06:02:36,019
Do you see how she sets herself up for success?

3940
06:02:36,739 --> 06:02:37,820
Takes a nice deep breath.

3941
06:02:39,546 --> 06:02:39,826
Nice.

3942
06:02:40,407 --> 06:02:45,251
That means that she is confident about what she's lifting.

3943
06:02:46,852 --> 06:02:49,094
Christensen gonna go for 330.

3944
06:02:52,577 --> 06:02:54,359
Hey, we're gonna get a little PR over here.

3945
06:02:54,959 --> 06:02:55,560
Butcher's lap.

3946
06:02:56,180 --> 06:03:01,925
And Peniela Christensen is having a great first five minutes here of the one rep max back squat.

3947
06:03:02,025 --> 06:03:03,426
I think she lied to us this morning.

3948
06:03:03,486 --> 06:03:05,588
There's no way that her one rep max was 390.

3949
06:03:06,695 --> 06:03:08,876
It's in the math.

3950
06:03:08,936 --> 06:03:11,937
It's all the conversions.

3951
06:03:11,957 --> 06:03:16,779
295 for Hannah Hardy.

3952
06:03:16,799 --> 06:03:16,779
325.

3953
06:03:16,819 --> 06:03:17,620
325.

3954
06:03:16,979 --> 06:03:17,620
Yeah.

3955
06:03:18,080 --> 06:03:19,820
Audrey Ann Perry Dupuy.

3956
06:03:21,801 --> 06:03:24,822
The beautification of putting the bar back doesn't discount.

3957
06:03:24,963 --> 06:03:26,103
It was a great lift.

3958
06:03:28,364 --> 06:03:29,124
She's happy with that.

3959
06:03:30,185 --> 06:03:32,105
This is a great start for Butcher's Lab.

3960
06:03:34,336 --> 06:03:37,078
A 300 lift, and you might even get two 300 lifts.

3961
06:03:37,819 --> 06:03:40,220
This is set for 295 for Agerbach.

3962
06:03:43,983 --> 06:03:46,205
And they were worried that this was not gonna be a strong event.

3963
06:03:46,405 --> 06:03:48,526
Zoe Jones fails for mayhem.

3964
06:03:48,946 --> 06:03:55,611
Okay, Butcher's Lab going for 295.

3965
06:03:55,671 --> 06:03:57,733
Let's see if she can hit this lift.

3966
06:03:59,443 --> 06:04:01,844
So she's going really, really slow on the way down.

3967
06:04:01,864 --> 06:04:05,765
That's telling me that that's a really heavy lift and she's not as confident as she's going up.

3968
06:04:05,785 --> 06:04:15,928
Now you've got an Olympic hopeful.

3969
06:04:16,768 --> 06:04:20,369
Really good clean and jerk, really good snatch here for Anne-Sophie Taschereau.

3970
06:04:21,738 --> 06:04:23,339
Yeah, she can stand up heavyweight.

3971
06:04:23,779 --> 06:04:24,699
Yeah, 335.

3972
06:04:25,960 --> 06:04:26,540
Looking good.

3973
06:04:26,841 --> 06:04:28,761
Knees were starting to cave in just a little bit.

3974
06:04:28,802 --> 06:04:32,483
That means that starting to get heavier, the glutes are probably a little bit weaker.

3975
06:04:32,523 --> 06:04:33,744
So something to work on.

3976
06:04:34,925 --> 06:04:42,868
Now Spiegel trying to pick out her weight.

3977
06:04:42,888 --> 06:04:43,569
335 is where she's at.

3978
06:04:43,589 --> 06:04:44,509
She's going to jump to 350.

3979
06:04:45,310 --> 06:04:46,790
I like that the guys are helping out.

3980
06:04:47,191 --> 06:04:48,551
That's so much easier for the girls.

3981
06:04:48,571 --> 06:04:49,692
They don't have to worry about that part.

3982
06:04:51,142 --> 06:04:53,723
She's got to get this off the rack in the next 10 seconds.

3983
06:04:55,484 --> 06:04:58,686
She won't pass Rebecca Divine, but 350 you will take all day.

3984
06:05:01,247 --> 06:05:01,647
Spiegel.

3985
06:05:01,667 --> 06:05:04,249
350, yes.

3986
06:05:05,309 --> 06:05:07,090
Does her job for Invictus.

3987
06:05:07,390 --> 06:05:09,552
And we are now on to the male five minutes.

3988
06:05:10,972 --> 06:05:12,573
And Phil Mascarella is going to say 350.

3989
06:05:12,653 --> 06:05:13,133
I'll lift that.

3990
06:05:13,754 --> 06:05:13,934
Yeah.

3991
06:05:15,895 --> 06:05:17,656
No, I think they're just switching out the J hooks.

3992
06:05:17,736 --> 06:05:17,836
Yeah.

3993
06:05:17,896 --> 06:05:19,577
And that's the thing.

3994
06:05:21,010 --> 06:05:22,691
I mean, he may as well squatter while he's here.

3995
06:05:22,991 --> 06:05:23,832
Put the 350 on the board.

3996
06:05:23,892 --> 06:05:24,452
Yeah.

3997
06:05:33,857 --> 06:05:35,198
Sandinista cracks 400.

3998
06:05:36,479 --> 06:05:42,262
Blueprint just put up a pair of 445s between Harry and OJ Keene.

3999
06:05:49,336 --> 06:05:50,657
And DeChico goes to 4.05.

4000
06:05:50,817 --> 06:05:57,039
You see how the back of his shirt is all chalked up.

4001
06:05:57,079 --> 06:06:01,421
That's just going to help with keeping that bar in place as they're squatting down and not slipping off.

4002
06:06:01,441 --> 06:06:08,964
Total Moroccan you just made quick work of 425 off screen for Oslo.

4003
06:06:09,004 --> 06:06:11,325
You're looking at a couple of 445 attempts.

4004
06:06:13,466 --> 06:06:14,706
Butcher slag hitting 445 as well.

4005
06:06:18,493 --> 06:06:19,673
That is Tomas Stroyer.

4006
06:06:23,635 --> 06:06:29,277
If you're looking for a serious upgrade in your lifts, you can save 15% on Lu Xiaojun shoes.

4007
06:06:29,837 --> 06:06:38,260
Scan the QR code on your screen now or head to luxiaojun.com, it's spelled on your screen, .com, and grab your pair today.

4008
06:06:38,300 --> 06:06:41,982
Lu Xiaojun, three-time Olympic champion, one of the greatest weightlifters of all time.

4009
06:06:43,602 --> 06:06:44,323
Transitive property.

4010
06:06:48,022 --> 06:06:49,405
475 is the best hit so far.

4011
06:06:49,445 --> 06:06:52,091
That's from Franco's that we talked about with Bella earlier.

4012
06:06:53,454 --> 06:06:54,516
And we'll go down to Bella now.

4013
06:06:57,365 --> 06:07:05,589
He knows how to lift really heavy, at least once.

4014
06:07:05,969 --> 06:07:09,171
And two, he's very familiar with a heavy back squat.

4015
06:07:09,211 --> 06:07:14,413
So if you'll watch him as he attempts this next lift, he's going to get that bar really low on his back.

4016
06:07:14,713 --> 06:07:17,395
And he's going to hinge over just a little bit more in that wider squat.

4017
06:07:17,415 --> 06:07:19,116
You can see over in lane seven as well.

4018
06:07:19,396 --> 06:07:21,357
Sam Demeester is doing the exact same thing.

4019
06:07:21,477 --> 06:07:23,738
It really helps if you're trying to get a little bit more leverage.

4020
06:07:24,378 --> 06:07:28,761
In lane six, right side of your screen, 500 pounds here for Josh Mattis.

4021
06:07:29,201 --> 06:07:30,482
Long levers!

4022
06:07:31,143 --> 06:07:32,244
Big power!

4023
06:07:32,324 --> 06:07:33,424
Yeah, some long levers.

4024
06:07:33,444 --> 06:07:37,267
That's why he's squatting so wide on the platform.

4025
06:07:39,509 --> 06:07:42,671
Three-time CrossFit Games veteran, and they're just trading him out.

4026
06:07:42,991 --> 06:07:48,135
Jordan Kerr is going to go for 500, as DiChico just hit 455 for Mayhem.

4027
06:07:49,275 --> 06:07:49,676
We'll get a

4028
06:07:50,569 --> 06:07:54,713
full pit stop change here for Butcher's Lab after a miss.

4029
06:07:57,675 --> 06:07:59,337
It's something to think about with these guys.

4030
06:07:59,577 --> 06:08:07,664
They're having to lift off of the women's J-hooks, which it's like an extra lift for them, which isn't always the most fun when you're trying to hit a PR.

4031
06:08:10,126 --> 06:08:10,827
Two minutes left.

4032
06:08:11,957 --> 06:08:14,298
The weight to beat is 1735.

4033
06:08:14,398 --> 06:08:17,500
Franco's right now is at 1590.

4034
06:08:17,640 --> 06:08:19,701
I think undivided is going to hold.

4035
06:08:19,721 --> 06:08:21,042
1615 is second.

4036
06:08:21,202 --> 06:08:22,622
That is within reach.

4037
06:08:22,682 --> 06:08:25,084
That's only 25 pounds away from where Franco's is currently.

4038
06:08:25,224 --> 06:08:27,365
As DeMeester hits 475 to up Mayhem's total to 1550.

4039
06:08:27,985 --> 06:08:29,246
That is in top 10 contention.

4040
06:08:42,035 --> 06:08:45,817
Only a five-pound jump here for Mattis, the former football player at Missouri State.

4041
06:08:46,697 --> 06:08:48,018
He was a short yardage back.

4042
06:08:49,319 --> 06:08:51,360
It's a short jump up to 5.05.

4043
06:08:54,561 --> 06:08:57,323
And he has got legs for days.

4044
06:08:57,423 --> 06:08:58,483
Yes, he does.

4045
06:08:59,624 --> 06:09:05,527
Muscarello hits 4.35 for Invictus.

4046
06:09:06,127 --> 06:09:09,229
4.80 in what looks like it could have been a PR over there for Le Repair.

4047
06:09:12,970 --> 06:09:14,711
They're in second place right now.

4048
06:09:14,831 --> 06:09:15,831
So they're in good standing.

4049
06:09:17,212 --> 06:09:18,532
Franco's is in first at 1590.

4050
06:09:18,832 --> 06:09:21,734
Then that repair at 1555.

4051
06:09:21,834 --> 06:09:28,256
This is big.

4052
06:09:28,736 --> 06:09:29,417
Jordan Kerr at 515.

4053
06:09:33,547 --> 06:09:35,088
Yes, good fight.

4054
06:09:35,588 --> 06:09:37,109
I love seeing the fight like that.

4055
06:09:37,169 --> 06:09:40,851
That means that they're confident that they can hit this even though it's a super heavyweight.

4056
06:09:41,312 --> 06:09:42,072
They're strong enough.

4057
06:09:42,713 --> 06:09:45,354
They know mentally they're strong enough to handle it.

4058
06:09:45,374 --> 06:09:47,595
We have a 9,999-pound attempt.

4059
06:09:47,635 --> 06:09:48,736
That's wild.

4060
06:09:48,816 --> 06:09:49,657
Let's go.

4061
06:09:50,737 --> 06:09:51,838
Here is Lara Pair.

4062
06:09:57,101 --> 06:09:58,262
And that's a good lift.

4063
06:10:00,801 --> 06:10:04,742
for Lara Pair at 4.85 at the buzzer.

4064
06:10:04,782 --> 06:10:13,305
4.55 in the meantime, just went up after the buzzer, but it will count for Helsinghoff, and that gets Oslo to 15.50.

4065
06:10:13,345 --> 06:10:20,127
Not unimportant for a team that was just out of first place.

4066
06:10:25,549 --> 06:10:29,952
1735 is going to be the event win that goes to undivided.

4067
06:10:29,992 --> 06:10:31,713
And boy, God, they need that.

4068
06:10:32,814 --> 06:10:40,339
Team that had podium expectations that has struggled so far for a couple of different reasons, but needing to fight their way out of a deep hole.

4069
06:10:42,100 --> 06:10:44,842
Let's take a look at our replay that is sponsored by Rook.

4070
06:10:47,072 --> 06:10:47,892
Well, here we go, guys.

4071
06:10:47,932 --> 06:10:49,413
We started with three.

4072
06:10:50,113 --> 06:10:54,934
Danny Spiegel hit 350 on her one rep back squat and making it look super easy.

4073
06:10:55,394 --> 06:10:58,795
Smooth down, smooth up, like it was nothing.

4074
06:10:59,055 --> 06:11:00,015
And I love to see that.

4075
06:11:00,595 --> 06:11:01,415
I love to see that.

4076
06:11:01,735 --> 06:11:03,776
And then we went over to CrossFit Franco's team.

4077
06:11:04,516 --> 06:11:05,996
He had a 515, Joel.

4078
06:11:06,136 --> 06:11:07,216
Are you kidding me?

4079
06:11:08,077 --> 06:11:10,337
And he made it look way too easy.

4080
06:11:10,957 --> 06:11:14,318
As we see him go down and come up with no problem.

4081
06:11:16,171 --> 06:11:19,094
I think that whole team behind them was jacked up for that.

4082
06:11:19,154 --> 06:11:19,775
And they needed that.

4083
06:11:19,835 --> 06:11:20,515
They needed that win.

4084
06:11:20,535 --> 06:11:23,278
So it's cool to see CrossFit Franco put that one right there.

4085
06:11:24,259 --> 06:11:25,901
Jordan Kerr with that big number.

4086
06:11:26,661 --> 06:11:30,905
That's a third followed by a fourth for CrossFit Franco's.

4087
06:11:31,006 --> 06:11:32,427
Good day on moving day.

4088
06:11:32,467 --> 06:11:33,608
They are in the top five.

4089
06:11:34,689 --> 06:11:35,610
Undivided the win.

4090
06:11:35,970 --> 06:11:37,872
Body blueprint in second.

4091
06:11:38,433 --> 06:11:38,913
11.24 in third.

4092
06:11:38,933 --> 06:11:40,455
Franco's with Bella Martin.

4093
06:11:41,551 --> 06:11:43,392
Jordan, 515, that's a PR.

4094
06:11:43,412 --> 06:11:45,453
You guys were in fifth going into today.

4095
06:11:45,513 --> 06:11:46,313
You needed this.

4096
06:11:46,813 --> 06:11:48,434
What did it take to get that 515 open?

4097
06:11:48,994 --> 06:11:53,376
It really just took the people in the crowd that came to support us and then the teammates.

4098
06:11:53,817 --> 06:11:57,458
I've been telling this whole weekend that if it wasn't for them, I wouldn't have made it this far.

4099
06:11:58,799 --> 06:12:02,701
And so being able to put up a big number for them and the crowd going wild is kind of what fueled it.

4100
06:12:03,521 --> 06:12:08,944
Tell me a little bit more about your community back home, what gyms you guys have, and the community and family that's here with you today.

4101
06:12:09,184 --> 06:12:09,344
Yeah.

4102
06:12:09,972 --> 06:12:12,294
So I'm from CrossFit 4 and 7 out of Missouri.

4103
06:12:12,534 --> 06:12:14,255
Josh owns his own gym out of Missouri.

4104
06:12:14,755 --> 06:12:17,597
Sammy's from Pennsylvania, and Hannah's from Virginia.

4105
06:12:18,078 --> 06:12:21,080
So kind of a conglomerate of people, or gyms, I guess.

4106
06:12:21,160 --> 06:12:27,745
But we have the CrossFit Franco's family here from Louisiana, and then members from our gyms back home.

4107
06:12:27,785 --> 06:12:32,128
And so just them spending the time and the money to come support us is really why we do it.

4108
06:12:33,188 --> 06:12:35,090
We've got one day left to go.

4109
06:12:35,130 --> 06:12:37,451
You guys are fighting for a podium spot.

4110
06:12:37,491 --> 06:12:39,313
What's it going to take to get on top tomorrow?

4111
06:12:40,017 --> 06:12:41,018
just believing in each other.

4112
06:12:42,238 --> 06:12:46,681
Brandon Lickett's our coach, and he's been telling us there's no reason it can't be us.

4113
06:12:47,462 --> 06:12:49,523
We fight hard every single day in training.

4114
06:12:49,583 --> 06:12:53,286
And just being there for each other and having fun has kind of been the theme.

4115
06:12:53,326 --> 06:12:54,607
And just whatever happens, happens.

4116
06:12:54,827 --> 06:12:55,987
The goal is to make the games.

4117
06:12:56,068 --> 06:12:56,888
Two of us are rookies.

4118
06:12:57,709 --> 06:13:00,831
And to be fighting for a podium spot is more than a dream come true.

4119
06:13:01,311 --> 06:13:06,715
So just standing on that dream and that promise and just knowing that we're here for each other really is why we're doing it.

4120
06:13:08,120 --> 06:13:10,061
Guys, talk about another good community story.

4121
06:13:10,161 --> 06:13:10,841
Congratulations.

4122
06:13:10,961 --> 06:13:11,301
Thank you.

4123
06:13:11,442 --> 06:13:11,702
Thank you.

4124
06:13:11,722 --> 06:13:12,162
We appreciate it.

4125
06:13:12,502 --> 06:13:13,062
Bella, thank you.

4126
06:13:13,082 --> 06:13:15,443
Brandon Luckett's gym, by the way, is CrossFit Franco's.

4127
06:13:15,783 --> 06:13:17,304
That's why they compete under that mantle.

4128
06:13:17,924 --> 06:13:19,445
Kerr and Pew are the rookies.

4129
06:13:19,565 --> 06:13:21,226
Hardy and Mattis are the veterans.

4130
06:13:21,326 --> 06:13:23,007
And they said, hey, sometimes we get overlooked.

4131
06:13:23,187 --> 06:13:25,068
We've been here a long time on teams.

4132
06:13:25,688 --> 06:13:27,569
No one's overlooking CrossFit Franco's now.

4133
06:13:28,069 --> 06:13:33,811
Games.CrossFit.com for all your games information, stats, standings, leaderboards, and more.

4134
06:13:34,032 --> 06:13:35,792
Individuals are back at it.

4135
06:13:36,273 --> 06:13:36,793
Stick around.

4136
06:13:51,834 --> 06:13:55,477
The 2025 CrossFit Games are brought to you by Rogue.

4137
06:13:56,038 --> 06:13:56,738
Don't weaken.

4138
06:13:57,359 --> 06:14:00,861
The official equipment supplier of CrossFit and the CrossFit Games.

4139
06:14:01,662 --> 06:14:02,343
Belites.

4140
06:14:02,923 --> 06:14:04,044
We are Belites.

4141
06:14:04,364 --> 06:14:06,266
We are made, not born.

4142
06:14:07,267 --> 06:14:08,948
The United States Border Patrol.

4143
06:14:09,168 --> 06:14:10,729
Be an agent of strength.

4144
06:14:11,870 --> 06:14:13,672
And Sotva.

4145
06:14:14,332 --> 06:14:16,154
Smarter luxury sleep.

4146
06:14:21,006 --> 06:14:27,871
You can't talk about power output without talking about intensity.

4147
06:14:28,112 --> 06:14:30,954
Now, intensity is just power output.

4148
06:14:31,254 --> 06:14:34,597
That's the only thing we care about when it comes to measuring intensity.

4149
06:14:34,917 --> 06:14:38,920
The more power you produce, the higher your intensity.

4150
06:14:39,460 --> 06:14:49,128
If it was heart rate, if heart rate was important, if heart rate produced power output, let's say I got a gun out and I point this gun at your head, what happens to your heart rate?

4151
06:14:50,565 --> 06:14:52,586
Goes up, are you doing any sort of fitness?

4152
06:14:53,846 --> 06:14:54,386
Producing any power?

4153
06:14:54,426 --> 06:14:54,546
No.

4154
06:14:54,866 --> 06:14:59,228
If I told you that we're going to lock the doors and do Fran at the end of the day, what happens to your heart rate?

4155
06:15:00,208 --> 06:15:00,548
Goes up.

4156
06:15:00,868 --> 06:15:02,068
Are you producing any amount of power?

4157
06:15:02,088 --> 06:15:03,549
Are you doing any sort of fitness?

4158
06:15:03,849 --> 06:15:04,569
No, exactly, right?

4159
06:15:05,049 --> 06:15:06,670
If I put you in a sauna, are you going to sweat?

4160
06:15:07,788 --> 06:15:08,529
That's not intensity.

4161
06:15:09,089 --> 06:15:12,113
All we care about is intensity, and high intensity is power output.

4162
06:15:12,193 --> 06:15:20,241
High intensity means high power output, which is why we use functional movements, because they maximise, or one of the best ways to produce high amounts of power.

4163
06:15:20,502 --> 06:15:21,723
So intensity is just power output.

4164
06:15:22,083 --> 06:15:27,749
The next question is then, OK, well, why is intensity so important that it's built into the definition of the programme?

4165
06:15:28,330 --> 06:15:29,491
Why do we love intensity so much?

4166
06:15:30,393 --> 06:15:38,718
Intensity is the independent variable most commonly associated with maximizing the rate of returns on variable adaptations.

4167
06:15:39,058 --> 06:15:45,501
That simply means that intensity is the best way to get results and to get results quickly.

4168
06:15:45,982 --> 06:15:46,122
Any

4169
06:15:46,782 --> 06:15:54,164
fitness program that is absent of intensity, is also absent of results, and absent of results in a time frame that makes sense to you.

4170
06:15:54,704 --> 06:15:56,745
You want the results pretty much as quick as possible.

4171
06:15:57,325 --> 06:15:57,605
Agreed?

4172
06:15:58,045 --> 06:15:59,606
Now, this isn't max intensity.

4173
06:15:59,946 --> 06:16:04,567
This is not smashing your head against the wall every day going to the gym.

4174
06:16:04,607 --> 06:16:05,207
It's not max.

4175
06:16:05,247 --> 06:16:06,108
It's just high intensity.

4176
06:16:06,168 --> 06:16:08,468
It's just trying to get as much work done as possible.

4177
06:16:08,849 --> 06:16:13,510
So intensity is just the way to get results.

4178
06:16:17,947 --> 06:16:19,527
and to get results quickly.

4179
06:16:20,088 --> 06:16:22,248
We love intensity because intensity gives us results.

4180
06:16:26,249 --> 06:16:33,171
What we need to understand with intensity is that it needs to be relative to an individual's physiological and psychological tolerances.

4181
06:16:33,311 --> 06:16:38,693
It means that intensity is going to look different for each individual that comes into your CrossFit gym.

4182
06:16:39,173 --> 06:16:41,113
Let's say, like, take two extremes, right?

4183
06:16:41,493 --> 06:16:45,534
Take, like, take, like, Tia Claire to me and take my grandmother, right?

4184
06:16:45,815 --> 06:16:47,095
Should they both be in a CrossFit class?

4185
06:16:48,332 --> 06:16:48,992
Yeah, they should, right?

4186
06:16:49,012 --> 06:16:55,694
Because my grandmother needs just, you know, some functional competence, where Tia Claire Toomey's looking for sort of functional dominance, right?

4187
06:16:56,074 --> 06:16:58,815
But these movements are natural, they're essential, they're safe.

4188
06:16:58,955 --> 06:17:04,436
So my grandmother needs to be doing thrusters and pull-ups just as much as Tia does, just the end goals are different, right?

4189
06:17:04,816 --> 06:17:07,557
Now, let's say they're both in your class, right?

4190
06:17:07,597 --> 06:17:12,358
Let's say that Tia does Fran in like, what are we saying, like two minutes?

4191
06:17:13,273 --> 06:17:16,274
Maybe two and a half now if she's like semi-retired, fair?

4192
06:17:16,294 --> 06:17:17,955
So two and a half minutes, two minutes for tea, right?

4193
06:17:18,295 --> 06:17:22,817
My grandmother's Fran is going to look a little bit different, right?

4194
06:17:22,917 --> 06:17:28,220
She's probably going to have like maybe a PVC pipe with like maybe a med ball or a low box to squat to.

4195
06:17:28,400 --> 06:17:30,801
She's going to squat down to that box with the PVC pipe.

4196
06:17:31,221 --> 06:17:32,582
She's going to stand up, she's going to press it overhead.

4197
06:17:33,122 --> 06:17:33,922
She can do 21 of those.

4198
06:17:34,362 --> 06:17:37,603
Her pull-ups may be like a jumping pull-up.

4199
06:17:37,683 --> 06:17:38,884
It might be a ring row.

4200
06:17:39,304 --> 06:17:43,285
It might be me sort of offering my arm out as she sits on the box.

4201
06:17:43,945 --> 06:17:46,526
She holds my arm and stands and pulls her chin up over the bar.

4202
06:17:47,206 --> 06:17:48,067
She can do 21 of those.

4203
06:17:48,447 --> 06:17:50,147
She'll do 15, 15, nine, nine.

4204
06:17:50,588 --> 06:18:01,391
As long as both athletes are working to the sort of limits of their physiological and psychological tolerances, they will both continue to get adaptation from the program for a long period of time.

4205
06:18:02,111 --> 06:18:07,553
We want my grandmother to push for intensity because we know that's where the results are.

4206
06:18:08,653 --> 06:18:11,614
Tia Claire Toomey wants the results to go and compete at the CrossFit Games.

4207
06:18:11,834 --> 06:18:17,276
My mother wants the results to maximise her fitness to keep her out of the nursing home in her advancing years.

4208
06:18:17,696 --> 06:18:17,956
With me?

4209
06:18:18,296 --> 06:18:22,878
So both athletes need intensity and they both need exposure to the programme.

4210
06:18:23,158 --> 06:18:24,098
It just looks a little bit different.

4211
06:18:24,258 --> 06:18:27,559
It just simply means that we have to scale the intensity back for the individual.

4212
06:18:27,959 --> 06:18:29,220
Someone's brand new into your gym,

4213
06:18:30,263 --> 06:18:34,466
someone's brand new into your gym, they need to probably be introduced to intensity.

4214
06:18:39,289 --> 06:18:46,494
Once they have good mechanics, they move well, and they're in the gym consistently, then we can sprinkle in a little bit of intensity as they go.

4215
06:18:47,255 --> 06:18:47,495
With me?

4216
06:18:47,895 --> 06:18:50,657
Both need intensity, because they both maximize results.

4217
06:18:51,098 --> 06:18:55,721
We just need to scale it to the individual in front of us in the gym, based off what they need.

4218
06:24:09,411 --> 06:24:09,591
you

4219
06:27:24,287 --> 06:27:24,508
do do

4220
06:35:52,010 --> 06:35:52,090
do

4221
06:41:26,731 --> 06:41:28,038
Thanks for watching!

4222
06:42:18,458 --> 06:42:20,044
you.

4223
06:52:07,555 --> 06:52:10,816
We are halfway through the 2025 CrossFit Games.

4224
06:52:12,217 --> 06:52:18,239
As the Games is moved to Albany, New York, in the MVP arena, today's coverage is presented by Belitis.

4225
06:52:18,719 --> 06:52:21,821
We are Belitis, and we are made not born.

4226
06:52:21,861 --> 06:52:22,621
Hello, everyone.

4227
06:52:22,941 --> 06:52:23,821
I'm Chase Ingram.

4228
06:52:23,881 --> 06:52:25,582
Along with me is Adrienne Conway.

4229
06:52:26,302 --> 06:52:29,303
Mike Arsenault will join us later on the floor.

4230
06:52:29,443 --> 06:52:31,704
And the boxes are out, and 200 points

4231
06:52:33,690 --> 06:52:39,452
are up for grabs in event 6 and 7 presented by the United States Border Patrol.

4232
06:52:39,552 --> 06:52:39,932
That's right.

4233
06:52:39,952 --> 06:52:41,992
This one's throttle up and hammer down.

4234
06:52:42,293 --> 06:52:48,754
Two separate scores worth 200 points, 35 calories on the ski, 28 chest-to-bars, and 24 burpee box jumpovers.

4235
06:52:49,055 --> 06:52:49,755
Folks, don't blink.

4236
06:52:49,795 --> 06:52:50,635
It's going to go fast.

4237
06:52:50,895 --> 06:52:57,117
And then we transition after a one-minute rest into 35 calories on a C2 bike, 28 bar muscle-ups.

4238
06:52:57,317 --> 06:52:58,237
That's not a misprint.

4239
06:52:58,457 --> 06:53:00,398
And 24 burpee box jumpovers to finish.

4240
06:53:02,335 --> 06:53:04,837
Adrian, what are your recipes for success here?

4241
06:53:05,297 --> 06:53:08,759
My goodness, we've got one focus for each score here.

4242
06:53:08,779 --> 06:53:11,160
You've got to go full send on event number six.

4243
06:53:11,481 --> 06:53:12,902
No holding back on the ski erg.

4244
06:53:13,002 --> 06:53:15,243
It's going to be hard to make up time once they leave that erg.

4245
06:53:15,663 --> 06:53:20,086
And then on the back half, event seven, you've got to pace and brake.

4246
06:53:20,286 --> 06:53:24,829
And that means you've got to be very collected and also plotful.

4247
06:53:25,109 --> 06:53:27,511
with how you break up those bar muscle-ups and pace the bikers.

4248
06:53:27,791 --> 06:53:29,832
The vests are back, and more on those.

4249
06:53:29,852 --> 06:53:31,153
Let's go down to Mike Arsenault.

4250
06:53:31,513 --> 06:53:32,114
That's right, Chase.

4251
06:53:32,134 --> 06:53:35,676
We had the extra wrinkle with the vest throughout Event 6 and Event 7.

4252
06:53:35,716 --> 06:53:41,360
The athletes are going to have to decide whether they're going for comfort or performance, because the tighter you had the vest,

4253
06:53:41,920 --> 06:53:43,320
the tighter is on the chest.

4254
06:53:43,340 --> 06:53:48,502
If you have a little bit looser, you can breathe a little bit better, but it'll be bouncing up and down on you when you try and do the burpees.

4255
06:53:48,802 --> 06:53:53,983
And also on the skier, the skier, very, very familiar implement for all these CrossFit athletes.

4256
06:53:54,023 --> 06:53:57,344
However, doing it, the vest will be a little bit unfamiliar.

4257
06:53:57,404 --> 06:54:02,565
So just an extra layer of difficulty for these athletes as they move through event six and seven.

4258
06:54:04,046 --> 06:54:04,666
Thank you, Mike.

4259
06:54:04,706 --> 06:54:08,967
You're laying assignments for heat one of three, going back to pizza of 10.

4260
06:54:12,305 --> 06:54:16,709
And we talked about athletes that are making their 10th appearance at the CrossFit Games.

4261
06:54:16,909 --> 06:54:20,432
Jona Koski is one of those three.

4262
06:54:20,492 --> 06:54:22,894
You have Brooke Wells, who has announced her retirement.

4263
06:54:22,974 --> 06:54:31,841
Tia Claire Toomey has hinted at that, but we are not sure yet, as we are just halfway through the competition.

4264
06:54:33,222 --> 06:54:36,025
And your Vision Fuels victory athlete to watch, Jona Koski.

4265
06:54:37,347 --> 06:54:41,768
In lane number eight now, Yodokoski, we're talking about a burpee box jump over race to the finish line.

4266
06:54:41,808 --> 06:54:43,448
That's something in his wheelhouse.

4267
06:54:43,648 --> 06:54:43,968
That's right.

4268
06:54:43,988 --> 06:54:50,049
When you're racing over any object and it's a short, sprinty, top-type stimulus, he's going to have an advantage.

4269
06:54:50,349 --> 06:54:53,110
And he's no stranger to high-level gymnastics.

4270
06:54:53,150 --> 06:55:04,512
Bill Lahey, who's got springboards for legs, is another athlete to keep your eye on on these burpee box jump overs.

4271
06:55:05,012 --> 06:55:06,212
35 cals on the skier.

4272
06:55:08,580 --> 06:55:10,142
And this is what we're looking at, Chase.

4273
06:55:10,562 --> 06:55:14,506
How reckless are you willing to be to get to 35 first?

4274
06:55:15,026 --> 06:55:21,373
It is going to be extremely difficult for athletes to exchange the lead once we exit these skiers.

4275
06:55:23,298 --> 06:55:27,181
Now, to add to the challenge, of course, that vest they're wearing is approximately 22 pounds.

4276
06:55:27,221 --> 06:55:34,067
It's not often that we find ourselves skiing intervals or skiing for meters in a workout with a weight vest on.

4277
06:55:34,107 --> 06:55:37,710
And as you're hinging at the hip, that adds a little bit of something to it.

4278
06:55:37,730 --> 06:55:40,512
Is that extra weight actually aid in a movement like this?

4279
06:55:40,912 --> 06:55:41,933
It absolutely does.

4280
06:55:41,973 --> 06:55:44,195
It increases our load.

4281
06:55:44,715 --> 06:55:51,081
And as we do that and increase our overall body mass, it's going to help us create that downward action that we're watching these athletes go through on the skier.

4282
06:55:51,121 --> 06:55:57,206
So while it adds resistance as we stand and extended the hip on the way up, it does help us leverage to pull down.

4283
06:55:57,647 --> 06:56:00,489
Moritz Fiebig, you can see the calories being counted.

4284
06:56:01,410 --> 06:56:12,921
On the bottom left corner of your screen, as we're just past the minute mark, Horst Fiebig is done with 35 cals and onto the rig for 28 chest-to-bar pull-ups.

4285
06:56:14,463 --> 06:56:17,126
And this is where these athletes are going to have to really be calculated.

4286
06:56:17,146 --> 06:56:18,066
Do you break?

4287
06:56:18,106 --> 06:56:21,250
And if you do, it's got to be extremely fast.

4288
06:56:22,510 --> 06:56:27,114
Tell you what, counting chest or bar pull-ups has never been easier for the judge, because all you've got to do is listen for it.

4289
06:56:27,375 --> 06:56:27,815
That's right.

4290
06:56:28,095 --> 06:56:33,741
And the contact that the judges are looking for right there with that chest plate that's actually on the vest, which is nice.

4291
06:56:33,821 --> 06:56:36,203
It shortens the distance that we've got to travel just a touch.

4292
06:56:36,263 --> 06:56:38,986
But of course, that compromises the extra 22 pounds.

4293
06:56:40,127 --> 06:56:40,968
The number to get to.

4294
06:56:42,981 --> 06:56:54,851
It's 63, and now it is a race across the floor, as there are 80 24-inch boxes spanning the length of the floor.

4295
06:56:54,871 --> 06:56:56,753
Athletes will do three at each one.

4296
06:56:56,993 --> 06:57:07,783
They have to step down on their first rep, step down on their second rep, and then as long as they clear the box and get over, they can do whatever they want to get to the next box, as Moritz Fiebig is six reps down.

4297
06:57:11,214 --> 06:57:15,636
And everyone seems to be moving pretty methodically here through these first few boxes.

4298
06:57:15,676 --> 06:57:16,916
I mean, there's a lot of urgency.

4299
06:57:17,276 --> 06:57:18,477
They're quick transitioning.

4300
06:57:18,937 --> 06:57:21,638
You see Kolski here towards the middle of your screen in the green shirt.

4301
06:57:21,678 --> 06:57:22,878
He's smooth over the box.

4302
06:57:23,158 --> 06:57:24,759
We're getting a great look at Fiebig here.

4303
06:57:25,239 --> 06:57:27,660
He's pivoting as he goes over top of the box.

4304
06:57:27,700 --> 06:57:32,381
It's one of the most effective and efficient ways to allow yourself to step down and still not lose time.

4305
06:57:32,401 --> 06:57:39,664
Ronisso Valenkiewicz trying to move up to give Moritz Fiebig a race.

4306
06:57:40,840 --> 06:57:47,665
But if you think about a short sprint across the floor, Morse Fiebing is a name that's at the top of your list.

4307
06:57:47,705 --> 06:57:50,206
You may do well as he's on the left side of your screen.

4308
06:57:51,407 --> 06:57:55,430
On the right side, you see Isaac Newman in lane seven and Yonakoski in lane eight.

4309
06:57:56,507 --> 06:58:00,789
Yeah, and what I like from Isaac right there in the middle of our screen is he's really leading with his chest on his burpees.

4310
06:58:00,809 --> 06:58:09,692
It means on his second one, we'll see here as he faces the box, he really almost worms down, leading with his chest, not creating a lot of stoppage time for his arms as they slow him down.

4311
06:58:09,932 --> 06:58:11,453
Final three reps for Moritz.

4312
06:58:11,813 --> 06:58:13,294
Just past the three-minute mark.

4313
06:58:13,434 --> 06:58:14,894
The time cap is six.

4314
06:58:15,595 --> 06:58:17,035
He'll get a minute break after this.

4315
06:58:17,055 --> 06:58:20,057
So the faster you go, the more rest you're going to get.

4316
06:58:20,597 --> 06:58:23,218
And Fiebig will take heat one for event number six.

4317
06:58:26,659 --> 06:58:28,219
Wow, and look at how tight that was there.

4318
06:58:29,160 --> 06:58:31,020
It looks like Newman may have edged him out at 318.35.

4319
06:58:31,560 --> 06:58:32,941
Oh, Isaac Newman.

4320
06:58:33,061 --> 06:58:33,301
What?

4321
06:58:33,941 --> 06:58:36,962
Excuse me, sir.

4322
06:58:36,982 --> 06:58:36,962
318.35.

4323
06:58:38,802 --> 06:58:40,743
Leading with that chest on those burpees paid off.

4324
06:58:42,283 --> 06:58:43,204
Lahey's across.

4325
06:58:45,724 --> 06:58:55,047
Athletes, once they get across the finish line, they will be able to dump the vest as part two, not part two, event seven, will be unvested.

4326
06:58:56,868 --> 06:58:58,229
All right, so now this is it.

4327
06:58:58,269 --> 06:58:59,050
This is the tough part.

4328
06:58:59,070 --> 06:59:02,313
But these athletes are really going to have their training and their fitness tested at this point.

4329
06:59:02,773 --> 06:59:15,885
How well can you bring your heart rate down and calm yourself, find some way to get some reprieve for your upper body, allow the blood and the lactate to pull away from the muscles that are going to be under high strain here in just a few minutes?

4330
06:59:16,866 --> 06:59:18,267
This is how close it's going to be.

4331
06:59:18,327 --> 06:59:21,310
We were thinking about this as soon as the event got announced last night.

4332
06:59:23,022 --> 06:59:24,963
We were saying seconds matter all weekend long.

4333
06:59:25,403 --> 06:59:28,465
Tenths of seconds are going to matter tonight.

4334
06:59:28,485 --> 06:59:32,228
318.35 for Newman, 318.98 for Feibig, and 319.40 are your top three times.

4335
06:59:32,428 --> 06:59:34,929
One second separating three spots.

4336
06:59:46,863 --> 06:59:49,424
Yeah, and I think what we're going to see is a lot of this to come.

4337
06:59:49,644 --> 06:59:54,485
Chase athletes watching this in the back saw exactly when Moritz Fiebig was able to get off that skier.

4338
06:59:54,525 --> 06:59:56,945
And they're going to say, OK, that's the time setter.

4339
06:59:57,445 --> 07:00:02,307
What can I tolerate in order to be faster than that and still go unbroken on my 28 chest-to-bar pull-ups?

4340
07:00:02,747 --> 07:00:07,128
And then it was here, I believe, that Moritz had the opportunity to really lay down the hammer there.

4341
07:00:07,688 --> 07:00:11,909
But it was Isaac Newman leading with his chest and flopping to the ground on the burpees.

4342
07:00:12,289 --> 07:00:16,110
And the sprint and urgency across that finish line is what got him that heat one win.

4343
07:00:16,980 --> 07:00:18,141
right there here in event six.

4344
07:00:19,121 --> 07:00:21,563
Gotta be aware of your surroundings at all time.

4345
07:00:21,623 --> 07:00:29,227
And the rookie Isaac Newman qualifying out of the Torium Pro gets a heat win.

4346
07:00:31,949 --> 07:00:46,057
Now once the time cap is set at six minutes, which we are 30 seconds away from, they'll have a minute transition in between the two before we start event number seven.

4347
07:00:47,802 --> 07:00:51,863
Now, this event is called Throttle Up into Hammer Down.

4348
07:00:52,583 --> 07:00:57,504
And when you shed the vest, that's about all you're supposed to do in event number seven.

4349
07:00:58,404 --> 07:00:58,564
Yeah.

4350
07:00:59,084 --> 07:01:00,305
Listen, it doesn't get any easier.

4351
07:01:00,365 --> 07:01:01,205
Taking the weight off.

4352
07:01:01,845 --> 07:01:06,366
They might rather add the weight back on and do less bar muscle-ups once they hit the reality of hanging from the rig.

4353
07:01:06,826 --> 07:01:15,348
One minute reset as Isaac Newman has the time to beat for event six.

4354
07:01:18,065 --> 07:01:19,710
We get set for event seven.

4355
07:01:20,774 --> 07:01:24,947
Now the event will start whether you're on your bike or not.

4356
07:01:32,726 --> 07:01:39,511
The same rep scheme applies, but we have two different movements, and we're doing it without the vest.

4357
07:01:39,691 --> 07:01:40,091
That's right.

4358
07:01:40,151 --> 07:01:44,114
Now we're going to introduce the Concept 2 stationary bike.

4359
07:01:44,134 --> 07:01:48,517
They're going to do 35 calories on that C2, and then 28-bar muscle-ups.

4360
07:01:48,858 --> 07:01:53,881
It's a lot longer to cycle eight 28-bar muscle-ups than it was those chest-to-bars, and that's going to be a deciding factor.

4361
07:01:54,142 --> 07:01:55,463
They've got to know when to break those up.

4362
07:01:56,603 --> 07:02:01,287
First time we've seen the C2 bike in competition for the individuals.

4363
07:02:03,087 --> 07:02:07,229
And event number seven, Hammer Down, is underway.

4364
07:02:07,589 --> 07:02:08,830
You gotta hammer the pedals.

4365
07:02:10,711 --> 07:02:12,312
You gotta hang on to the pull-up bar.

4366
07:02:13,572 --> 07:02:19,936
And then the race on the burpee box jumpovers will be on, but you're not going to be fresh when you get there.

4367
07:02:22,877 --> 07:02:26,499
Isaac Newman took the heat for event number six.

4368
07:02:27,960 --> 07:02:29,761
Can he double it up here at event number seven?

4369
07:02:32,131 --> 07:02:34,353
These guys all cycling pretty aggressively here.

4370
07:02:34,873 --> 07:02:40,198
It's hard to read because really for us to have an understanding of the wattage that they're putting out, we'd have to see the dampers and all the things.

4371
07:02:40,238 --> 07:02:42,660
But we get a beautiful shot of exactly where they're at.

4372
07:02:42,680 --> 07:02:44,461
And they're just eating up these calories.

4373
07:02:45,002 --> 07:02:51,427
Some of them almost getting a calorie a second there as they're just ticking by the low 20s at this point, already 46 seconds in.

4374
07:02:51,827 --> 07:02:53,689
Yunakoski got third in that heat.

4375
07:02:55,150 --> 07:02:56,151
Again, it is close.

4376
07:02:56,691 --> 07:03:01,155
One second for three spots between Isaac Newman, Yunakoski, and Morse Fiebig.

4377
07:03:03,730 --> 07:03:08,691
My prediction is that we'll see a touch more separation here from these athletes in the finish of this.

4378
07:03:08,731 --> 07:03:12,012
And it's going to be due to the bar muscle-ups, of course, different strategies at play.

4379
07:03:12,032 --> 07:03:16,073
But they've got to really trust their fitness from a gymnastics point of view here.

4380
07:03:16,153 --> 07:03:20,995
You can't just bike fast for no reason if you don't feel like you're going to excel at the bar muscle-up.

4381
07:03:21,015 --> 07:03:21,595
It's pointless.

4382
07:03:23,536 --> 07:03:24,916
Bebig off the bike first.

4383
07:03:24,936 --> 07:03:26,756
28 bar muscle-ups.

4384
07:03:32,792 --> 07:03:42,718
While this movement forces the athletes to travel a much greater range, going from all the way down to a fully supported position above the bar, it's a chance for them to steady and slow their heart rate.

4385
07:03:43,859 --> 07:03:44,599
It's smooth.

4386
07:03:44,679 --> 07:03:45,400
It's predictable.

4387
07:03:45,420 --> 07:03:50,423
There's not a lot of violent hip drive, really, because they're all so physically strong in their upper body.

4388
07:03:50,483 --> 07:03:51,624
It's more of a swing and a pull.

4389
07:03:54,966 --> 07:03:57,287
Passing the 10-rep mark.

4390
07:03:57,327 --> 07:04:00,289
If you look at the top of your screen, we're also cresting the two-minute mark.

4391
07:04:01,763 --> 07:04:03,925
The rep count to get to is 63.

4392
07:04:04,185 --> 07:04:11,571
As Peter Ellis takes his first break as Fiebig hangs on.

4393
07:04:11,791 --> 07:04:14,113
And Buckland was already down to his first break as well.

4394
07:04:19,377 --> 07:04:21,659
Fiebig, 10 reps left to go.

4395
07:04:24,401 --> 07:04:25,983
Isaac Newman on the right side.

4396
07:04:28,138 --> 07:04:31,020
Trying to see if he can double up here at event six and seven.

4397
07:04:31,320 --> 07:04:33,802
Bill Leahy takes a break as well.

4398
07:04:35,343 --> 07:04:39,645
Can Febig pull himself back in the lead on his second set?

4399
07:04:43,648 --> 07:04:45,109
The number is 63.

4400
07:04:45,269 --> 07:04:46,530
Five more reps to go.

4401
07:04:49,832 --> 07:04:53,154
This is going to be that threshold slash breaking point for a lot of the athletes in this event chase.

4402
07:04:53,194 --> 07:04:56,516
I think a lot of them have their eyes set on one big set and a smaller set to get to 20,

4403
07:04:59,458 --> 07:05:03,580
Fiebing has a second opportunity to not get sniped at the end.

4404
07:05:05,261 --> 07:05:07,862
Peter Ellis has one more rep.

4405
07:05:07,882 --> 07:05:10,303
He got called back to the rig in the bottom part of your screen.

4406
07:05:10,343 --> 07:05:15,565
Enrique Morera is on to the burpee box and forwards along with Yota Koski.

4407
07:05:15,825 --> 07:05:18,847
Here comes Koski with a bit more urgency running to the boxes.

4408
07:05:24,038 --> 07:05:35,061
Bibig did the same thing in event six where he led all the way to the last box and at the last second Yonakoski and Isaac Newman had caught up to him.

4409
07:05:39,322 --> 07:05:48,325
Moritz still moving at a solid clip here as Burpee's a little bit more urgent than that first score scored event you got to think he doesn't want to happen again what he allowed in that last one.

4410
07:05:49,591 --> 07:05:57,213
You see Moritz looking across the field, a bit more aware of his surroundings, as you said, than in event six.

4411
07:05:58,453 --> 07:06:03,974
Two back-to-back score events, 200 points up for grabs in a span of 15 minutes.

4412
07:06:05,614 --> 07:06:06,835
Past the four-minute mark.

4413
07:06:07,975 --> 07:06:10,675
Moritz Fiebig has nine reps left to go.

4414
07:06:12,696 --> 07:06:18,717
Yonakoski, Bill Leahy, and Enrique Moreira are trying to chase down Fiebig.

4415
07:06:20,175 --> 07:06:21,316
Yeah, Fiebig's doing his job.

4416
07:06:21,336 --> 07:06:24,518
He's doing exactly what he needs to do in order to keep that distance between him and Moreira.

4417
07:06:26,059 --> 07:06:28,601
He's leading better with his chest than he was on the last round.

4418
07:06:28,621 --> 07:06:32,704
He typically would lead with his hips, and then his chest would roll to the ground, and he's much more aggressive now.

4419
07:06:33,425 --> 07:06:36,067
Fiebig on the last box, upper part of your screen.

4420
07:06:37,988 --> 07:06:38,989
And it happened once.

4421
07:06:41,931 --> 07:06:43,152
And it's not gonna happen again.

4422
07:06:43,472 --> 07:06:47,996
Fiebig will take heat one of it's seven.

4423
07:06:51,530 --> 07:06:59,594
Enrique Moreno across the finish line.

4424
07:07:00,975 --> 07:07:03,136
Bill Leahy with a full clear of that box.

4425
07:07:04,196 --> 07:07:04,976
Leahy's in.

4426
07:07:05,397 --> 07:07:06,257
Koski's in.

4427
07:07:07,318 --> 07:07:08,498
Right on the five minute mark.

4428
07:07:08,558 --> 07:07:10,139
Time cap is eight minutes.

4429
07:07:10,919 --> 07:07:13,921
Bill really made up some ground on Yona right there on those final burpees.

4430
07:07:14,821 --> 07:07:19,203
Jorge Fernandez across the finish line.

4431
07:07:22,528 --> 07:07:30,473
Olinkiewicz, Peter Ellis across, Tiago Lucis, and Toby Buckland have nine reps left to go.

4432
07:07:30,493 --> 07:07:33,795
If you look at the back part of your screen, that is Isaac Newman.

4433
07:07:33,835 --> 07:07:40,859
And the question was, with 200 points up for grabs, event by event, separated by one minute,

4434
07:07:42,129 --> 07:07:45,452
Is it worth sending one and hanging on for the other?

4435
07:07:45,712 --> 07:07:49,176
And it looks like that is what Isaac's plan was the whole time.

4436
07:07:50,097 --> 07:07:52,819
And that's a calculated risk that athletes have to be willing to take.

4437
07:07:52,839 --> 07:07:53,780
Know thyself.

4438
07:07:53,820 --> 07:07:59,446
We've heard Bethany Flores teach us all that lesson throughout the course of this weekend and the time that we've got to spend with her.

4439
07:07:59,606 --> 07:08:02,468
It's one of her favorite lessons as an athlete, probably as a human.

4440
07:08:03,189 --> 07:08:09,892
But it's about understanding where you can get the most bang for your buck, or where the juice is worth the squeeze, as they say, when it comes to points accumulation.

4441
07:08:09,952 --> 07:08:15,715
And for some, it's about full sending it, even if that's at a sacrifice of a lesser finish in the following event.

4442
07:08:17,316 --> 07:08:18,777
Buckling to cross the finish line.

4443
07:08:20,318 --> 07:08:23,939
Newman on his second-to-last box.

4444
07:08:24,000 --> 07:08:31,003
Again, athletes will do three burpee box jumpovers at each box for a total of eight sections and 24 reps.

4445
07:08:33,734 --> 07:08:35,316
Plenty of time before we hit the cap.

4446
07:08:37,638 --> 07:08:45,966
As Newman is hoping it was worth the send in event six to see how that time stacks up for the next two heats.

4447
07:08:47,133 --> 07:08:58,777
But Moritz Fiebing, consistency is always key if you want to excel at the CrossFit Games, as he gets second and first in heat number one.

4448
07:08:58,997 --> 07:09:00,697
Highlights presented by Rogue Fitness.

4449
07:09:01,237 --> 07:09:03,838
Yeah, this back-to-back didn't start any better than it could have for Moritz.

4450
07:09:03,858 --> 07:09:06,559
Of course, there's going to be a lot of scores left to input.

4451
07:09:07,099 --> 07:09:10,500
But what a great way to set himself up for success.

4452
07:09:10,540 --> 07:09:16,142
He got the 28-bar muscle-ups in a smooth two sets, one larger set, one smaller set to finish.

4453
07:09:16,882 --> 07:09:21,245
And then he didn't have enough urgency in event number six just before this.

4454
07:09:21,285 --> 07:09:23,807
But event number seven, he wasn't going to make that mistake again.

4455
07:09:24,187 --> 07:09:29,691
And he finished with the appropriate amount to get him an event seven, at least for now, the score to beat.

4456
07:09:30,672 --> 07:09:35,235
Your heat results for event number seven, Moritz Fiebig, 443.

4457
07:09:35,855 --> 07:09:43,141
Not as close as far as timing wise as we saw in event six is Enrique Moreira.

4458
07:09:44,126 --> 07:09:44,427
gets 454.

4459
07:09:44,729 --> 07:09:46,115
Heat one is done.

4460
07:09:46,456 --> 07:09:47,822
Heat two coming up next.

4461
07:13:04,627 --> 07:13:07,128
Saturday night at MVP Arena here in Albany, New York.

4462
07:13:07,829 --> 07:13:12,331
For the 2025 CrossFit Games, today's coverage is presented by Velites.

4463
07:13:14,492 --> 07:13:15,333
I'm Chase Ingram.

4464
07:13:15,833 --> 07:13:18,054
Along with me is Adrian Conway and Mike Arsenault.

4465
07:13:19,295 --> 07:13:20,636
We'll be on the floor as we get set.

4466
07:13:22,603 --> 07:13:24,904
for individual event six and seven.

4467
07:13:24,924 --> 07:13:26,944
Throttle up, hammer down.

4468
07:13:27,344 --> 07:13:28,524
And it's an exciting one, Chase.

4469
07:13:28,544 --> 07:13:35,586
This starts fast and furious with 35 calories on the skier, 28 chest-to-bar pull-ups, and 24 burpee box jump-overs.

4470
07:13:35,666 --> 07:13:36,626
Don't blink, folks.

4471
07:13:37,046 --> 07:13:38,187
It's over that quickly.

4472
07:13:38,687 --> 07:13:40,887
Then they get a one-minute reset, and we're right into event seven.

4473
07:13:40,907 --> 07:13:49,489
It's a 35 calorie, this time on a C2 bike, 28 bar muscle-ups, and 24 burpee box jump-overs, both worth 100 points each.

4474
07:13:49,509 --> 07:13:51,970
Your lane assignments for heat number two

4475
07:13:53,150 --> 07:14:10,936
As these here middle 10 athletes of the 30 that are competing this weekend and we have receded Since the one rep max back squat And your vision fuels victory athlete to watch Colton Mertens put up a staggering 370 pounds and if no if anyone needed 200 points more

4476
07:14:15,404 --> 07:14:17,866
I don't think anyone needs more than Colton Mertens.

4477
07:14:18,106 --> 07:14:18,747
No, no, no.

4478
07:14:19,087 --> 07:14:19,927
You said it.

4479
07:14:19,947 --> 07:14:21,088
570 on that back squat.

4480
07:14:21,128 --> 07:14:22,309
It was crazy to watch.

4481
07:14:22,689 --> 07:14:24,951
This is his fourth individual appearance at the CrossFit Games.

4482
07:14:24,991 --> 07:14:27,093
His best finish overall is 18th.

4483
07:14:27,253 --> 07:14:28,334
Right now sitting in 15th.

4484
07:14:28,354 --> 07:14:30,375
This still isn't where Colton expected to be this year.

4485
07:14:30,615 --> 07:14:32,036
And I know this isn't where he wants to end up.

4486
07:14:32,056 --> 07:14:33,137
He's going to come out hungry.

4487
07:14:33,377 --> 07:14:36,440
And I expect him to make some moves in this combination of scores 6 and 7.

4488
07:14:37,100 --> 07:14:40,863
But watch out for him on number 7, setting a mean score and a hard one to beat.

4489
07:14:42,367 --> 07:14:47,589
Another athlete that was in the top 10 and looking to maybe get back in before we start the final day.

4490
07:14:47,649 --> 07:14:51,791
Kyle Iansuzza has had himself a heck of a weekend.

4491
07:14:53,332 --> 07:14:53,792
Absolutely.

4492
07:14:53,852 --> 07:15:04,297
Consistency sitting in 12th place, and this is his third consecutive CrossFit Games.

4493
07:15:04,317 --> 07:15:05,558
35 cows on the skier.

4494
07:15:05,578 --> 07:15:07,498
22 pound vests.

4495
07:15:10,863 --> 07:15:12,084
And the race is to the rig.

4496
07:15:13,525 --> 07:15:24,896
We saw in the previous heat, Moritz Fiebig was first to the rig, first to the box, but lost out on the last second on that final burpee box jump over to Isaac Newman.

4497
07:15:26,357 --> 07:15:34,805
And Isaac Newman pulled a fast one and just sent event six and survived event seven.

4498
07:15:35,485 --> 07:15:37,007
Is anyone in this heat gonna do the same?

4499
07:15:38,214 --> 07:15:44,600
I think everyone watching that has experienced tired burpees could relate to Isaac Newman there on that final stretch of those.

4500
07:15:44,660 --> 07:15:46,922
We understand where he was and what he was feeling.

4501
07:15:47,723 --> 07:15:49,405
Probably a lack of body control.

4502
07:15:49,705 --> 07:15:54,209
The race has just started here for these men and they are churning and burning through these calories.

4503
07:15:54,269 --> 07:15:55,030
Very aggressive.

4504
07:15:55,471 --> 07:15:57,292
We don't expect to see a ton of lead change.

4505
07:15:57,933 --> 07:16:01,536
Like you mentioned, Chase, we saw just a slight amount towards the end of those burpees on the last one.

4506
07:16:02,217 --> 07:16:04,600
They've got to get going here on the skier.

4507
07:16:04,980 --> 07:16:13,730
Now, Mertens will probably slower up the skier, because Callum Clements is already to the rig, as he's four seconds ahead of the pace set by Newman.

4508
07:16:16,053 --> 07:16:19,376
Now, once Mertens gets to the rig, the race is on.

4509
07:16:19,396 --> 07:16:19,817
That's right.

4510
07:16:21,772 --> 07:16:30,578
That short range of motion that he gets to pull with as we're watching all these athletes execute a butterfly pull up, those feet coming forward as they pull their chin up and above the bar from behind.

4511
07:16:30,618 --> 07:16:34,101
They got to make contact with the best breastplate of that vest.

4512
07:16:34,561 --> 07:16:35,402
The number to get to is 63.

4513
07:16:35,762 --> 07:16:38,604
That's at the top of your screen, Callum Clements.

4514
07:16:39,845 --> 07:16:42,527
Looks like he's going for it in this heat.

4515
07:16:45,468 --> 07:16:49,029
He's on pace that Isaac Newman had at 143.

4516
07:16:49,189 --> 07:16:54,531
Here comes Mertens and Ty Jenkins joined by the rest of the field.

4517
07:16:58,192 --> 07:17:02,634
Callum Clements in lane number two, upper part of your screen, just past the two minute mark.

4518
07:17:03,754 --> 07:17:05,315
Time to beat 318.35.

4519
07:17:07,816 --> 07:17:11,897
After the fourth box, Isaac Newman

4520
07:17:13,187 --> 07:17:13,927
was done at 257.

4521
07:17:14,488 --> 07:17:21,071
Callum Clemens is on the fourth box.

4522
07:17:24,912 --> 07:17:30,935
Clemens moving smoothly, but still very urgently stepping up every burpee, making quick haze transition from box to box.

4523
07:17:34,277 --> 07:17:36,458
Clemens is ahead of the pace set by Newman.

4524
07:17:38,864 --> 07:17:49,107
Looks like Colin Bossard is trying to stick with him, as Callie and Susan, the right side of your screen, isn't backing down just yet.

4525
07:17:49,127 --> 07:17:53,748
30 seconds before he hit the time to beat.

4526
07:17:54,508 --> 07:17:57,549
Clemens, six reps left to go.

4527
07:17:59,589 --> 07:18:01,010
He's got to go, it's going to be close.

4528
07:18:03,602 --> 07:18:05,502
Last jump before the last box.

4529
07:18:06,343 --> 07:18:07,083
Three reps.

4530
07:18:07,103 --> 07:18:09,723
13 seconds left.

4531
07:18:13,244 --> 07:18:14,324
It's going to be close.

4532
07:18:15,405 --> 07:18:17,345
Can he get across the finish line?

4533
07:18:20,666 --> 07:18:25,087
And Bossard, Mertens, Souza are in.

4534
07:18:25,887 --> 07:18:28,027
Wow.

4535
07:18:28,307 --> 07:18:29,188
3.17, the new time to beat.

4536
07:18:29,248 --> 07:18:30,808
Bossard actually snuck in.

4537
07:18:33,524 --> 07:18:34,044
at 3.18.23.

4538
07:18:35,165 --> 07:18:45,070
Well, we talked about it being fast, and it's always fast at the end.

4539
07:18:45,110 --> 07:18:47,891
These athletes only being separated by a matter of seconds.

4540
07:18:51,033 --> 07:18:52,794
Nick Matthews across the finish line.

4541
07:18:58,487 --> 07:19:02,552
All athletes look to be done under the four minute mark.

4542
07:19:02,912 --> 07:19:04,514
Now the time cap is six.

4543
07:19:06,736 --> 07:19:11,421
They'll rest until the time cap and we'll have a minute transition.

4544
07:19:12,623 --> 07:19:17,248
The question is, is Callum Clements taking a page out of the Isaac Newman playbook?

4545
07:19:20,053 --> 07:19:22,915
And this is where you really have to lean heavily on your preparation.

4546
07:19:23,536 --> 07:19:36,206
Optimally, these athletes have all experienced this in the buildup to the CrossFit Games, where they've completely sold their soul to a workout, rested with a very short turnaround, and still tried to give it the same type of intensity and approach.

4547
07:19:36,926 --> 07:19:42,791
Because if you've done your history, you know you're likely up against some kind of back-to-back scoring system at the CrossFit Games.

4548
07:19:42,811 --> 07:19:47,695
These highlights by Rogue Fitness, and it was all Callum Clements from start to finish.

4549
07:19:49,280 --> 07:20:00,990
Yeah, he did a great job having that urgency off the skier, and he watched that heat before knowing, hey, if I can take the lead here, it's all about sheer grit and fortitude, a bit of urgency on these burpees, and I can get the job done.

4550
07:20:01,010 --> 07:20:03,292
And that's exactly what Clements did here.

4551
07:20:03,792 --> 07:20:10,598
Urgency with just the appropriate amount to edge out Isaac Newman from the last heat for event number six.

4552
07:20:15,285 --> 07:20:22,467
Your results from heat number two, Callum Clements, 3.17, the first athlete to break the 3.18 mark.

4553
07:20:22,527 --> 07:20:29,788
With Colin Bossart's time of 3.18, that marks three athletes at the 3.18 mark, with another at 3.19.

4554
07:20:31,929 --> 07:20:36,450
So you're top five with Colton Mertens at 3.20 in heat number two.

4555
07:20:40,670 --> 07:20:49,034
And you see the athletes chalking up strategically at this end of the floor so they don't have to worry about it as they sit down to that biker here in event seven that's quickly approaching.

4556
07:20:51,835 --> 07:20:53,636
10 seconds before the six minute cap.

4557
07:20:54,916 --> 07:21:03,300
Athletes will get 60 seconds to work their way down the floor and get set for event seven.

4558
07:21:05,241 --> 07:21:06,181
Throttle up is done.

4559
07:21:06,881 --> 07:21:07,802
Hammer down is next.

4560
07:21:11,124 --> 07:21:21,713
We've got a whole different workout worth 100 points, 35 calories this time on the C2 bike, 28 bar muscle ups, and then 24 burpee box jump overs.

4561
07:21:21,753 --> 07:21:25,216
We understand the bar muscle up is where a significant amount of the time is gonna be taken.

4562
07:21:25,256 --> 07:21:32,201
We saw athletes in that last event, or last heat, accomplished a 28 in an average of two sets.

4563
07:21:33,402 --> 07:21:36,305
It really just dictated on when and how long they broke.

4564
07:21:44,641 --> 07:21:50,825
Tying the beat, 443.70 by Moritz Fiebig in heat number one.

4565
07:21:51,846 --> 07:22:03,813
This is heat two with one heat remaining.

4566
07:22:04,174 --> 07:22:05,875
35 cows on the Concept 2 bike.

4567
07:22:07,598 --> 07:22:15,680
You notice a lot of these guys start with that standing start to rev up those RPMs and get the wattage a bit high, so then they can ride the momentum created on that C2 bike.

4568
07:22:15,740 --> 07:22:16,720
A lot of urgency here.

4569
07:22:17,120 --> 07:22:20,701
They want to be one of the first athletes to the rig for the bar muscle-up.

4570
07:22:21,922 --> 07:22:26,663
Colton Mertens, who desperately needs points.

4571
07:22:30,167 --> 07:22:37,450
And a lot of these athletes are just on the outside looking in of that top 10 as we receive going into the morning.

4572
07:22:37,490 --> 07:22:42,132
And there is vital importance of being in that last heat going into Sunday.

4573
07:22:43,492 --> 07:22:45,913
This is the opportunity to make a lot of moves.

4574
07:22:45,973 --> 07:22:51,196
And there's going to be a lot of unknowns, even as we watch that final heat take the floor with those 200 points available.

4575
07:22:51,236 --> 07:22:53,116
There's just going to be a tremendous amount of shakeup.

4576
07:22:53,417 --> 07:22:56,718
It is almost going to feel blind until all the athletes are through this double scored event.

4577
07:22:59,155 --> 07:23:06,997
These men have to have an understanding that if Mertens is going to beat them to the rig, there's going to be a small chance for them to have an opportunity to beat this guy.

4578
07:23:07,257 --> 07:23:11,518
When he gets there, he's going to be threatening to be one of those athletes to rip off 28 in a row if it's possible.

4579
07:23:11,778 --> 07:23:16,340
Clements is off the bike again, or at least off the machine first.

4580
07:23:18,000 --> 07:23:24,482
But Mertens is much closer than he was after the skier at Event 6.

4581
07:23:24,802 --> 07:23:28,283
Tudor Magda on the right side of your screen, also on the bar muscle-ups.

4582
07:23:29,547 --> 07:23:32,591
And there's one thing that Colton Merton prides himself on.

4583
07:23:32,611 --> 07:23:35,935
It's the ability to hang on to a pull-up bar.

4584
07:23:37,998 --> 07:23:43,184
The time is now if Merton wants to get himself back into the top 10.

4585
07:23:44,532 --> 07:23:48,375
Tudor Mac down the right in the cutoff blue has a really unique cycle rate.

4586
07:23:48,615 --> 07:23:50,497
It's much faster than a lot of the competitors.

4587
07:23:50,517 --> 07:23:54,440
He's choosing not to pause at all through the transition and press out right away.

4588
07:23:54,480 --> 07:24:00,405
This is going to afford him, I'm sure in his mind, hopefully a little bit of time for that break that we just watched him take.

4589
07:24:00,965 --> 07:24:03,547
But you'll notice his press out is just a lot faster at the top.

4590
07:24:03,587 --> 07:24:05,228
It allows him to cycle reps a bit quicker.

4591
07:24:06,269 --> 07:24:10,312
Just past the two minute mark on the upper left corner of your screen.

4592
07:24:10,352 --> 07:24:13,055
If you look at the hat on top, it's Mertens takes a break.

4593
07:24:13,948 --> 07:24:15,750
The number to get to is 63.

4594
07:24:16,131 --> 07:24:17,653
Mertens eight reps away.

4595
07:24:18,634 --> 07:24:21,157
Moritz Fiebig was done with the bar muscle-ups at 259.

4596
07:24:21,317 --> 07:24:25,643
Mertens back on the bar.

4597
07:24:26,383 --> 07:24:28,947
Even with the break, no one is yet to get close to him.

4598
07:24:34,308 --> 07:24:37,051
And this is where Clemens took a really long break right there, Chase.

4599
07:24:37,071 --> 07:24:42,938
This is where you start to see the accumulation effects of taking the victory on that event six there to kick things off.

4600
07:24:42,978 --> 07:24:44,400
One more rep for Mertens.

4601
07:24:44,480 --> 07:24:45,181
Can he get it?

4602
07:24:46,342 --> 07:24:53,230
Squeezes it out and now the race is on the box as he is 14 seconds ahead of pace.

4603
07:24:55,157 --> 07:24:58,159
Mearns is not racing these 10 guys.

4604
07:24:58,219 --> 07:25:00,060
He's racing the next 10 guys.

4605
07:25:00,800 --> 07:25:05,163
He needs another event win in the most desperate way.

4606
07:25:05,223 --> 07:25:08,985
Unfortunately, he has to do it by himself in the second heat.

4607
07:25:11,987 --> 07:25:16,710
And this is the climb that he's had from that slow start at a 26th spot.

4608
07:25:16,730 --> 07:25:19,771
We've got a 20th, a 10th, a 19th, and a first.

4609
07:25:20,192 --> 07:25:22,433
Where will these next two scores settle him on the leaderboard?

4610
07:25:25,926 --> 07:25:28,970
Moritz Fiebig, who has the time to beat in the upper left corner of your screen at 443.70.

4611
07:25:29,010 --> 07:25:29,991
After this fourth box, he was at the 3.52 mark.

4612
07:25:30,011 --> 07:25:32,113
Mertens, 15 seconds ahead of pace still.

4613
07:25:43,548 --> 07:25:49,973
Yeah, and this is the urgency you love to see from the athletes right here, as Mertens really is digging deep, staying as low as he can to the box.

4614
07:25:50,073 --> 07:25:51,894
It's a race to the ground, every rep chase.

4615
07:25:52,034 --> 07:25:53,976
This is where athletes can start to take things for granted.

4616
07:25:53,996 --> 07:25:54,696
They flop down.

4617
07:25:55,077 --> 07:25:57,278
Colton is attacking the ground after every repetition.

4618
07:25:57,298 --> 07:25:59,320
This is gonna set him apart from the score to beat.

4619
07:26:00,801 --> 07:26:02,822
Mertens on his sixth box.

4620
07:26:03,263 --> 07:26:05,464
There's eight in every lane on the floor.

4621
07:26:06,665 --> 07:26:08,487
Six more reps to go for Mertens.

4622
07:26:09,828 --> 07:26:11,349
Just past the four minute mark.

4623
07:26:14,272 --> 07:26:18,535
30 seconds stands between Mertens and a new time to beat.

4624
07:26:23,137 --> 07:26:28,740
Colton Mertens with one more box jump has to get across the finish line.

4625
07:26:28,760 --> 07:26:33,863
And there you go, Heat 3.

4626
07:26:33,963 --> 07:26:35,384
Have fun with that.

4627
07:26:35,404 --> 07:26:35,384
427.63.

4628
07:26:35,544 --> 07:26:39,106
Ty Jenkins trying to get away from Chris Ibarra.

4629
07:26:39,246 --> 07:26:39,486
Wow.

4630
07:26:44,405 --> 07:26:50,250
A little synchro action there from the boys to finish the event.

4631
07:26:50,270 --> 07:27:02,200
17 one hundredths of a second between Ibarra and Jenkins as Moritz time will at least stand for fourth best in the event with one heat left to go.

4632
07:27:03,381 --> 07:27:04,262
Bossart's in.

4633
07:27:06,984 --> 07:27:07,825
Callum Clements.

4634
07:27:09,768 --> 07:27:15,972
Still hanging tough for us, so definitely not sending the full event six, and trying to hang on here at event seven.

4635
07:27:23,396 --> 07:27:23,856
Zanoni.

4636
07:27:26,858 --> 07:27:27,738
Captain Jack.

4637
07:27:28,599 --> 07:27:29,079
Souza.

4638
07:27:29,559 --> 07:27:30,560
Souza's in.

4639
07:27:30,940 --> 07:27:31,520
Magda.

4640
07:27:35,343 --> 07:27:37,484
One athlete left on the floor, that is Nick Matthew.

4641
07:27:48,203 --> 07:27:49,664
Did we learn some lessons, Chase?

4642
07:27:50,764 --> 07:27:55,386
Do you hold back just a touch now after seeing all the rest of the athletes take the floor for event six?

4643
07:27:55,426 --> 07:27:59,928
Are you like, okay, I want to finish second in my heat on that one so then I can come back and do the thing.

4644
07:28:00,788 --> 07:28:01,989
Colton Mertens.

4645
07:28:05,590 --> 07:28:09,432
Sets the time to beat for event number seven.

4646
07:28:10,852 --> 07:28:11,853
Here are your highlights.

4647
07:28:12,753 --> 07:28:14,974
Mr. Mertens, presented by Rogue Fitness.

4648
07:28:16,860 --> 07:28:21,602
Mr. Mertens, we knew we had to have an eye for him, but it was Clements off the bike first.

4649
07:28:22,482 --> 07:28:37,106
We, however, had a firm understanding that if Colton could rope someone in to stay close enough for these bar muscle-ups that this would be that movement, that he's got an advantage, a faster cycle rate, and we know he can go big when it comes to the volume here for these hanging gymnastics.

4650
07:28:37,366 --> 07:28:38,607
And that's exactly what he did.

4651
07:28:40,377 --> 07:28:55,744
Set a great pace, was ahead of the previous heat already at this point, but then it was his effectiveness and efficiency with these burpees submitting to the discomfort and leading with his chest and torso for every rep that allowed him to now have the time to beat.

4652
07:28:58,008 --> 07:28:59,629
Your heat, two results.

4653
07:29:00,510 --> 07:29:01,230
Colton Mertens at 427.63.

4654
07:29:01,390 --> 07:29:05,173
Only athlete under 430 so far with Ibarra and Jenkins at 439.

4655
07:29:05,213 --> 07:29:07,675
The third and final heat, 200 points up for grabs.

4656
07:29:07,695 --> 07:29:09,276
Next, here in MVP Arena.

4657
07:32:03,865 --> 07:32:13,709
Saturday night at MVP arena as we get set for heat three men's event six and seven for the 2025 CrossFit Games.

4658
07:32:14,590 --> 07:32:17,271
I'm Chase Ingram along with me is Adrian Conway.

4659
07:32:17,791 --> 07:32:22,253
Mike Arsenault will be joining us shortly on the competition floor in your

4660
07:32:22,413 --> 07:32:24,615
standings after five events.

4661
07:32:24,935 --> 07:32:33,061
Jason Hopper has reclaimed the leader jersey over James Crouch, but now a 20-point lead.

4662
07:32:33,442 --> 07:32:40,707
And Justin Medeiros has now moved into a third-place position and is looking very dangerous.

4663
07:32:44,010 --> 07:32:45,571
Individual events six and seven.

4664
07:32:45,871 --> 07:32:47,732
Throttle up, hammer down.

4665
07:32:48,807 --> 07:32:56,173
The first one's for time with a vest, a 35-calorie ski, 28 chest-to-bar pull-ups, and 24 burpee box jump-overs.

4666
07:32:56,873 --> 07:32:57,734
Folks, don't blink.

4667
07:32:58,094 --> 07:32:59,055
It is going to be that quick.

4668
07:32:59,315 --> 07:33:07,182
After a one-minute reset, they're going to get into a 35-calorie C2 bike, 28-bar muscle-up, and 24 burpee box jump-overs, all for time.

4669
07:33:07,502 --> 07:33:08,603
But this time, no vest.

4670
07:33:08,963 --> 07:33:11,046
Adrian, what are your recipes for success?

4671
07:33:11,226 --> 07:33:11,927
They're straightforward.

4672
07:33:11,947 --> 07:33:13,710
On this first one, you've got to be full send chase.

4673
07:33:14,090 --> 07:33:18,316
Once we exit the skier, there's not going to be much time to change the lead.

4674
07:33:18,536 --> 07:33:21,220
And then on the back half, it's pace don't break for event seven.

4675
07:33:21,420 --> 07:33:24,445
You've got to pace yourself and know when to break up those 28-bar muscle-ups.

4676
07:33:26,705 --> 07:33:29,368
Your lane assignments for your third and final heat.

4677
07:33:30,529 --> 07:33:35,714
Your top three on the leaderboard will be in lanes five, six, and four.

4678
07:33:36,574 --> 07:33:41,739
And the man in lane four is your two-time CrossFit Games champ, Justin Medeiros.

4679
07:33:42,220 --> 07:33:44,242
With more on him, let's go down to Mike Arsenault.

4680
07:33:44,802 --> 07:33:45,383
Thanks, Chase.

4681
07:33:45,423 --> 07:33:53,449
When Justin won his titles back in 2021 and 2022, he was the model of consistency, and he's lacked that the last couple of years.

4682
07:33:53,509 --> 07:34:02,396
But now, for the first time in a couple of years, he finds himself on the podium this late in the competition, and he's reeled off four consecutive finishes in the top 10.

4683
07:34:02,456 --> 07:34:06,139
And both Event 6 and Event 7 line up very well for him.

4684
07:34:06,179 --> 07:34:11,743
We'll see if he can make it six in a row as he looks to return to the podium for the first time since 2022.

4685
07:34:13,245 --> 07:34:17,966
Lines up very well for two other athletes as our vision fuel victory athletes to watch.

4686
07:34:17,986 --> 07:34:20,587
That is Jason Hopper and Roman Krennikoff.

4687
07:34:22,008 --> 07:34:26,909
The big fellas came to play and they're going to like the looks of this skier with 20 extra pounds on their body chase.

4688
07:34:27,229 --> 07:34:35,171
I'm looking at both of these guys as an all out race to be one of the first men off the skier and try to lead the rest of event six.

4689
07:34:35,772 --> 07:34:36,732
We'll see how it plays out.

4690
07:34:37,718 --> 07:34:40,539
Jason Hopper back in the lead with 20 points.

4691
07:34:40,679 --> 07:34:50,741
Jeff Adler did not have the squat we are accustomed to seeing, but perhaps he has a little left in the tank with 200 points up for grabs.

4692
07:35:02,964 --> 07:35:04,444
Heat number three underway.

4693
07:35:06,446 --> 07:35:07,727
35 cows on the skier.

4694
07:35:09,769 --> 07:35:11,211
Your top 10 athletes.

4695
07:35:13,013 --> 07:35:16,156
After five events, we are cresting the halfway point.

4696
07:35:17,237 --> 07:35:21,181
And we're doing with back-to-back events here in event number six and event number seven.

4697
07:35:21,722 --> 07:35:22,643
Roman Krennikov.

4698
07:35:23,780 --> 07:35:28,947
Sitting outside of podium position in fourth place with 365 points.

4699
07:35:29,808 --> 07:35:35,575
Justin Medeiros holds that third place position, 27 points more than him.

4700
07:35:36,036 --> 07:35:40,141
But if anybody can crank on a skier and hang on to a pull-up bar,

4701
07:35:41,297 --> 07:35:53,943
That's right, and if people weren't paying attention to how he got here, they can go back and watch the final at the Mayhem Classic on one of the ways that he was able to accumulate a lot of points is by going unbroken on big sets of bar muscle-ups with bikers.

4702
07:35:55,084 --> 07:36:03,588
So he lines it up, and he's willing to risk it for the biscuit, as they say, on a workout like this, as we see Jason Hopper already accumulating well past the 30-calorie range.

4703
07:36:05,587 --> 07:36:08,772
The time to beat is set by Callum Clements at 3.17.

4704
07:36:08,812 --> 07:36:10,195
He was off the skier at 1.04.

4705
07:36:11,116 --> 07:36:16,165
So Krennikov, everyone, is about four seconds behind Clements.

4706
07:36:21,239 --> 07:36:21,699
Here we go.

4707
07:36:21,859 --> 07:36:24,880
These butterfly pull-ups are no problem for any of these athletes in this final heat.

4708
07:36:25,040 --> 07:36:26,521
They're all going to go 28 unbroken.

4709
07:36:26,561 --> 07:36:29,522
Who can be the most efficient with their range of motion?

4710
07:36:29,802 --> 07:36:33,803
Meeting the minimum standard is going to be hitting that vest right on the top of that bar.

4711
07:36:34,143 --> 07:36:36,784
Events 6 and 7 is presented by the U.S.

4712
07:36:36,884 --> 07:36:37,645
Border Patrol.

4713
07:36:38,205 --> 07:36:38,385
U.S.

4714
07:36:38,425 --> 07:36:39,545
Border Patrol is hiring.

4715
07:36:39,605 --> 07:36:40,406
Make an impact.

4716
07:36:40,486 --> 07:36:41,646
Be an agent of strength.

4717
07:36:42,346 --> 07:36:49,949
Apply now at cbp.gov forward slash crossfit as Dallin Pepper is on to the box.

4718
07:36:51,264 --> 07:37:01,878
But it is James Sprague all the way down in lane number 10 doing James Sprague things.

4719
07:37:02,159 --> 07:37:06,345
Your 2024 CrossFit Games champion, wasting no time trying to get ahead of the pack.

4720
07:37:08,038 --> 07:37:11,340
Yeah, we like James Sprague in any ERG event, and he's doing exactly what he needs to do.

4721
07:37:11,460 --> 07:37:18,044
Fast through the pull-up bar, he wore his vest a little bit loose chase, which has allowed him to travel a lesser distance to make contact with that pull-up bar.

4722
07:37:18,064 --> 07:37:22,547
And what he really needs to do is he needs to be ahead of that 226 mark after this box.

4723
07:37:23,448 --> 07:37:25,869
And he's five seconds ahead of the pace by Clemens.

4724
07:37:27,310 --> 07:37:28,971
Sprague needs 100 points here.

4725
07:37:30,072 --> 07:37:34,195
He's five seconds ahead of the pace, and about 10 seconds ahead of the field.

4726
07:37:36,185 --> 07:37:38,886
Nine more reps to go for James Sprague.

4727
07:37:47,168 --> 07:37:49,649
Six burpee box jump overs left.

4728
07:37:49,929 --> 07:37:52,289
No time wasted in transition between the boxes.

4729
07:37:52,329 --> 07:37:54,470
James is making a very clean run here.

4730
07:37:55,290 --> 07:38:01,692
It's a race between James and the clock and he has 20 seconds to set the time to beat.

4731
07:38:05,680 --> 07:38:11,706
James Sprague was sitting in 10th, but not much longer, because he just got 100 points.

4732
07:38:18,233 --> 07:38:19,794
Gerrard's across, 314.

4733
07:38:20,215 --> 07:38:21,236
Gerrard needed that.

4734
07:38:21,356 --> 07:38:22,737
All these athletes needed that.

4735
07:38:23,838 --> 07:38:24,879
Justin Medeiros is in.

4736
07:38:26,384 --> 07:38:32,608
And Hopper looked like he got out sprinted by about three athletes right at the end.

4737
07:38:33,148 --> 07:38:34,149
Jay Crouch was one of them.

4738
07:38:34,649 --> 07:38:37,971
And that is huge for Jay Crouch.

4739
07:38:41,753 --> 07:38:45,956
We talked about this event coming down to tenths of seconds.

4740
07:38:46,736 --> 07:38:48,917
James Spray gets first in the event.

4741
07:38:49,378 --> 07:38:49,438
OK.

4742
07:38:50,348 --> 07:38:53,070
Hopper getting out sprinted at the finish.

4743
07:38:54,111 --> 07:38:56,252
Got 17th in that event.

4744
07:38:57,673 --> 07:39:00,575
Keep in mind, there are 30 athletes competing.

4745
07:39:01,255 --> 07:39:04,658
A 17th place finish is 39 points.

4746
07:39:06,139 --> 07:39:07,640
Crouch, a 16th.

4747
07:39:10,281 --> 07:39:14,504
There was a big gap between your top four and the next six.

4748
07:39:15,265 --> 07:39:18,087
Not anymore, and we got another 100 points waiting in the wings.

4749
07:39:18,985 --> 07:39:20,807
Let's check out these highlights presented by Rowe.

4750
07:39:20,827 --> 07:39:21,267
Wow.

4751
07:39:21,307 --> 07:39:22,708
Well, we were on it early.

4752
07:39:22,748 --> 07:39:23,809
We were watching Roman.

4753
07:39:23,849 --> 07:39:25,191
We were watching Jason.

4754
07:39:25,931 --> 07:39:33,678
But there was another big fella in this heat by the name of James Sprague, who was handling business down to the bottom of the right of the screen here.

4755
07:39:34,058 --> 07:39:39,804
First one to the Burpee Box Jumpovers, and there was absolutely no looking back for James.

4756
07:39:42,595 --> 07:39:51,229
It was technical proficiency from rep one all the way through 24 on those brick-a-box jump overs, and he just wrapped himself up in a big win here for 2025 CrossFit Games.

4757
07:39:52,585 --> 07:39:58,928
Adrian, if you wanted to ask me, name five athletes that make big points in a big way.

4758
07:39:59,488 --> 07:40:04,090
Those names go James Sprague, Ricky Gerrard, Dallin Pepper, Austin Hatfield.

4759
07:40:04,950 --> 07:40:07,351
We also needed the guys changing to have some big losses.

4760
07:40:07,431 --> 07:40:09,992
And we just had that in event six.

4761
07:40:10,713 --> 07:40:14,614
What was a four-pack running away is now compressed.

4762
07:40:14,654 --> 07:40:15,935
But who had the best overall?

4763
07:40:16,415 --> 07:40:17,355
Justin Medeiros.

4764
07:40:18,796 --> 07:40:19,796
And that's what we like to see, Chase.

4765
07:40:19,817 --> 07:40:20,657
We had a conversation.

4766
07:40:21,715 --> 07:40:23,736
walking through the halls of the MVP arena.

4767
07:40:24,376 --> 07:40:25,716
And what we say it was time for?

4768
07:40:25,736 --> 07:40:28,537
It's time to get desperate for some of these athletes.

4769
07:40:28,757 --> 07:40:31,778
Some of these athletes that were on the cusp, this is the time to make your move.

4770
07:40:32,018 --> 07:40:36,539
And they are making those moves right now, showing signs of desperation with high levels of execution.

4771
07:40:36,839 --> 07:40:40,800
Jesse Medeiros finished the best of the guy's top four men.

4772
07:40:41,860 --> 07:40:44,221
But it was still a 13th place position.

4773
07:40:45,978 --> 07:40:49,381
So we have 100 more points on the board up for grabs.

4774
07:40:50,081 --> 07:40:56,707
And with the way that event just went down, what was a big gap is now compressed.

4775
07:40:58,844 --> 07:41:01,987
This could be a make or break event for everyone's podium hopes.

4776
07:41:02,648 --> 07:41:03,830
It's only Saturday night.

4777
07:41:04,711 --> 07:41:05,732
Don't get me excited.

4778
07:41:06,032 --> 07:41:06,993
It's only Saturday night.

4779
07:41:07,013 --> 07:41:07,434
That's right.

4780
07:41:07,474 --> 07:41:08,696
But this is the Saturday night.

4781
07:41:08,716 --> 07:41:09,677
This is the big event, baby.

4782
07:41:09,697 --> 07:41:10,638
This is what we came to see.

4783
07:41:10,898 --> 07:41:13,662
Every year at the CrossFit Games, Dave Cash has said this for years.

4784
07:41:13,702 --> 07:41:16,065
There's an event that someone has a performance.

4785
07:41:16,605 --> 07:41:20,006
that shows you who the CrossFit Games champion could be.

4786
07:41:20,526 --> 07:41:28,088
Could this be the event on Saturday night, in this heat, with some of the best athletes that all have a chance to stand on top of the podium?

4787
07:41:29,389 --> 07:41:30,829
And this is what they have in store.

4788
07:41:30,849 --> 07:41:37,031
35 cals on the bike, 28-bar muscle-ups, 24 burpee box jump-overs.

4789
07:41:37,491 --> 07:41:41,272
The vest is gone, and it's time to hammer down.

4790
07:41:49,476 --> 07:41:54,962
We saw from the previous heat, this is less about who is first off the bike and more about who is first off the bar.

4791
07:42:03,813 --> 07:42:04,914
It's not an eco bike.

4792
07:42:05,515 --> 07:42:07,116
It's just about ripping the handle.

4793
07:42:11,348 --> 07:42:12,588
off the bike to get it going.

4794
07:42:12,808 --> 07:42:14,849
When you talk about desperation, that's what it looks like, Chase.

4795
07:42:14,869 --> 07:42:16,089
That's hunger and desire there.

4796
07:42:16,309 --> 07:42:19,630
James does a lot of interval-based training at really high intensity.

4797
07:42:19,930 --> 07:42:21,431
He's got a great aerobic base.

4798
07:42:21,791 --> 07:42:24,952
And his coach knows that he's got to dose him up with power and strength work.

4799
07:42:25,172 --> 07:42:27,693
And that comes in the form of a lot of repeat intervals, just like this.

4800
07:42:27,953 --> 07:42:30,714
We could be seeing that pay off in this back-to-back with 6 and 7.

4801
07:42:31,314 --> 07:42:35,075
The time to beat is set by Colton Mertens in heat number 2.

4802
07:42:36,982 --> 07:42:40,785
Mertens was off the bike in 112, but that is not where he made up his time.

4803
07:42:40,845 --> 07:42:42,526
He made up his time on the bar muscle-ups.

4804
07:42:43,627 --> 07:42:50,993
We know almost every athlete in this heat can dance on these pedals better than anybody else, but can they hang on to that pull-up bar?

4805
07:42:52,494 --> 07:42:59,760
And if we're comparing to Colton Mertens, not quite as good as Colton, because that cycle rate is almost impossible for a lot of these young men to match.

4806
07:43:00,340 --> 07:43:02,702
But they could probably get close to matching that rep scheme.

4807
07:43:02,722 --> 07:43:05,985
They're going to have to have a lot of urgency in getting off this bike faster than he did.

4808
07:43:08,920 --> 07:43:13,785
We're gonna see a lot of athletes off the bike at near the same time as we are past the 110 mark.

4809
07:43:15,147 --> 07:43:21,034
Behind the pace of Mertens, but it is Dow and Pepper who is to the pull-up bar first.

4810
07:43:22,643 --> 07:43:28,166
Pepper with also a fast lockout at the top, a little bit faster than what we see as close to us as possible here from James.

4811
07:43:28,507 --> 07:43:30,828
James almost rests on the rig, then presses out.

4812
07:43:31,348 --> 07:43:35,071
Dallin Moore pressing out as he rises above the rig itself.

4813
07:43:35,491 --> 07:43:38,853
That's the 90 second mark clock in the upper left corner of your screen.

4814
07:43:39,353 --> 07:43:41,935
The rep counter is at the top of your screen.

4815
07:43:41,995 --> 07:43:44,696
The number to get to is 63.

4816
07:43:45,457 --> 07:43:50,140
Jason Hopper took a 17th place finish in that last event.

4817
07:43:54,820 --> 07:43:58,323
There's gonna be a lot of shakeups here between the six and seven score.

4818
07:43:58,343 --> 07:44:03,867
These 200 points are, as we've alluded to, very impactful for tomorrow's lineup.

4819
07:44:04,067 --> 07:44:06,869
Holton Merton's got to 55 before he took a break.

4820
07:44:07,189 --> 07:44:07,730
Pepper's at 54.

4821
07:44:08,010 --> 07:44:12,634
The time check is two minutes and 44 seconds.

4822
07:44:14,415 --> 07:44:18,898
Pepper has nine reps to go as Sprague takes his first break.

4823
07:44:19,459 --> 07:44:23,242
Don't sleep on Ricky Garrard over in lane number one as he's trying to keep pace with Pepper.

4824
07:44:24,658 --> 07:44:25,919
Hatfield drops for a break.

4825
07:44:29,040 --> 07:44:29,880
Adler's down.

4826
07:44:32,301 --> 07:44:33,822
Handful of reps left to go.

4827
07:44:35,202 --> 07:44:36,303
Pepper took a break.

4828
07:44:36,823 --> 07:44:38,163
Can Rickey make his move here?

4829
07:44:40,904 --> 07:44:42,725
Rickey's got to hold on for two more.

4830
07:44:44,666 --> 07:44:47,227
James Spragues at the bottom right also takes a break.

4831
07:44:48,527 --> 07:44:49,668
And it is Rickey Gerard.

4832
07:44:54,137 --> 07:44:54,918
Ricky Garrard.

4833
07:44:54,938 --> 07:44:59,361
He's got a full two reps on Dallin right now.

4834
07:44:59,421 --> 07:45:01,542
Took second in the event in event six.

4835
07:45:05,905 --> 07:45:16,992
Garrard has to have this if he wants a chance to chase his dream, and that's to stand on top of the podium at the CrossFit Games.

4836
07:45:20,195 --> 07:45:21,796
Ricky Garrard's currently sitting

4837
07:45:23,419 --> 07:45:28,185
outside of a podium position, as he is in ninth place.

4838
07:45:29,607 --> 07:45:33,111
He needs these points in a big way, but he's starting to get reeled in.

4839
07:45:35,414 --> 07:45:39,599
After the fourth box, Burns was done at 338.

4840
07:45:43,210 --> 07:45:49,875
Ricky put on some amazing performances at the semi-final level in the in-affiliate testing stage, and he's doing it now.

4841
07:45:50,096 --> 07:45:52,437
Ricky has three boxes left to go.

4842
07:45:52,457 --> 07:45:53,598
That means nine reps.

4843
07:45:54,839 --> 07:45:56,200
Make that six reps.

4844
07:45:56,220 --> 07:46:07,670
30 seconds, and Ricky could have himself a monster evening and have all the momentum going into Sunday.

4845
07:46:11,919 --> 07:46:13,519
Time to beat 427.

4846
07:46:14,380 --> 07:46:18,941
One rep left for Ricky, and it is a Ricky Mack attack.

4847
07:46:20,221 --> 07:46:23,482
Garrard takes Hammerdown.

4848
07:46:25,902 --> 07:46:27,163
Here comes Dallin Pepper.

4849
07:46:28,423 --> 07:46:30,863
He needs this just as much as anybody else.

4850
07:46:31,044 --> 07:46:33,904
Oh, and we've got a showdown behind Pepper.

4851
07:46:35,165 --> 07:46:37,005
Justin Medeiros just got a no rep.

4852
07:46:39,475 --> 07:46:40,696
And Roman's in.

4853
07:46:40,976 --> 07:46:41,697
Sprague.

4854
07:46:42,838 --> 07:46:43,438
Hopper.

4855
07:46:46,841 --> 07:46:47,601
Medeiros.

4856
07:46:47,701 --> 07:46:48,222
Wow.

4857
07:46:48,522 --> 07:46:52,125
Now that might have been a tough no rep for Medeiros.

4858
07:46:52,385 --> 07:46:53,586
Tough one for Pepper too.

4859
07:46:55,027 --> 07:46:56,888
He was shaping up to be second in that heat.

4860
07:46:57,949 --> 07:47:00,731
Merton should hang on a second overall in the event.

4861
07:47:02,312 --> 07:47:04,474
Jane Sprague gets first and third.

4862
07:47:05,194 --> 07:47:07,076
Ricky Gerrard gets second and first.

4863
07:47:09,139 --> 07:47:11,941
Harry Lightfoot just trying to hang.

4864
07:47:13,903 --> 07:47:15,944
And boy, oh boy.

4865
07:47:20,208 --> 07:47:25,472
Get your calculators out because this leaderboard.

4866
07:47:28,369 --> 07:47:31,692
is gonna change in a big way.

4867
07:47:32,732 --> 07:47:35,795
Who will be wearing the leader jersey going into Sunday?

4868
07:47:36,435 --> 07:47:48,645
Ricky Garrard gets second in event six, first in event seven, with an extra 196 points to his total going into Sunday.

4869
07:47:50,106 --> 07:47:52,268
An absolute devastation.

4870
07:47:52,288 --> 07:47:52,928
Devastation.

4871
07:47:53,909 --> 07:47:54,790
On the finishing map.

4872
07:47:57,044 --> 07:47:58,085
That's what you love to see.

4873
07:47:58,105 --> 07:47:59,326
That's called intensity, folks.

4874
07:47:59,947 --> 07:48:00,908
We're familiar with that.

4875
07:48:01,408 --> 07:48:02,349
We know what that's like.

4876
07:48:04,191 --> 07:48:06,594
Replays by Rogue Fitness.

4877
07:48:08,458 --> 07:48:11,540
Well, these guys were all in full attack mode.

4878
07:48:11,780 --> 07:48:12,821
Chase, we talked about it.

4879
07:48:13,241 --> 07:48:18,345
If these guys want to be on the podium, it is time to execute with desperate measure.

4880
07:48:18,685 --> 07:48:20,206
They've got to be intense.

4881
07:48:20,286 --> 07:48:21,407
They've got to be calculating.

4882
07:48:21,427 --> 07:48:22,268
They've got to go get it.

4883
07:48:22,288 --> 07:48:27,972
And Ricky Guerrard did just that, coming out with a ferocious pace on event six.

4884
07:48:28,012 --> 07:48:30,894
We hadn't seen many people be successful in the back-to-back.

4885
07:48:31,274 --> 07:48:35,016
Ricky showed us it is possible when you've been training for these moments.

4886
07:48:35,817 --> 07:48:36,998
High level of execution.

4887
07:48:38,445 --> 07:48:43,487
Ricky's just racked up 196 of them, and he's carrying in the momentum into Sunday morning.

4888
07:48:43,947 --> 07:48:46,388
Ricky Garrard takes Event 7.

4889
07:48:47,168 --> 07:48:48,769
Colton Mertens gets second.

4890
07:48:48,829 --> 07:48:53,250
James Sprague, huge back-to-back finishes for him.

4891
07:48:53,270 --> 07:48:56,251
It was important for Ricky.

4892
07:48:58,132 --> 07:49:00,033
Your two winners in Event 6 and Event 7.

4893
07:49:01,330 --> 07:49:03,331
James Sprague and Ricky Garrard.

4894
07:49:03,891 --> 07:49:05,953
What a performance by both of these gentlemen.

4895
07:49:06,033 --> 07:49:08,394
Event 6 and Event 7 winners joining me.

4896
07:49:08,454 --> 07:49:12,236
Both of you just squeaked into that final heat, 10th and 9th place respectively.

4897
07:49:12,997 --> 07:49:16,439
Both of those performances going to push you a little bit further up the leaderboard.

4898
07:49:16,479 --> 07:49:17,539
James, let's start with you.

4899
07:49:17,579 --> 07:49:18,780
This is your title defense.

4900
07:49:19,200 --> 07:49:22,202
How would you describe how your title defense has gone thus far?

4901
07:49:22,262 --> 07:49:23,803
We've had some uneven performances.

4902
07:49:24,303 --> 07:49:24,803
Totally, yeah.

4903
07:49:24,823 --> 07:49:27,085
It hasn't been the best executed weekend.

4904
07:49:27,105 --> 07:49:34,789
There's a couple mishaps I've made early in the weekend, but today I woke up with a refreshed mindset, renewed headspace, just knowing that hungry dogs run faster.

4905
07:49:34,849 --> 07:49:37,010
So I'm not going to slow down when things get hard.

4906
07:49:37,030 --> 07:49:37,591
I'm going to speed up.

4907
07:49:38,231 --> 07:49:46,776
What did you take from the experience winning at last year's games that is helping you adjust to maybe performances that you're not entirely happy with this year?

4908
07:49:47,497 --> 07:49:47,797
Totally.

4909
07:49:47,837 --> 07:49:50,058
It's just knowing this is a professional sport.

4910
07:49:50,078 --> 07:49:53,000
You're not always going to win every race, but what you can do

4911
07:49:53,760 --> 07:49:58,842
is learn from your failures, learn from your hardships, learn from the things that go well, take it to the next one.

4912
07:49:59,342 --> 07:50:02,163
I believe the more times I step out here, the better and more resilient I'm going to get.

4913
07:50:02,223 --> 07:50:08,905
So just trying to keep stack experiences so in 10 years I can still be out here crushing it, hanging out with these awesome dudes.

4914
07:50:09,425 --> 07:50:10,985
Your second career event win.

4915
07:50:11,246 --> 07:50:12,066
Congratulations.

4916
07:50:12,126 --> 07:50:12,426
Rest up.

4917
07:50:12,446 --> 07:50:12,886
We'll see you tomorrow.

4918
07:50:13,186 --> 07:50:14,086
Thank you very much, guys.

4919
07:50:14,126 --> 07:50:14,827
Amazing crowd.

4920
07:50:15,427 --> 07:50:15,567
Woo!

4921
07:50:18,655 --> 07:50:26,341
All right, Ricky, speaking of up and down performances, your second event win of the weekend thus far, with a few performances outside of the top 10.

4922
07:50:26,602 --> 07:50:33,287
So how do you try and keep yourself on that even keel as you progress through these events, as we move through a difficult weekend of competition?

4923
07:50:34,108 --> 07:50:35,769
Yeah, a couple of things haven't gone my way.

4924
07:50:35,909 --> 07:50:39,132
Last night on the pegboard was unfortunate, but it is what it is.

4925
07:50:40,493 --> 07:50:41,174
And the back squats.

4926
07:50:42,695 --> 07:50:43,516
Yeah, it's just back squats.

4927
07:50:43,576 --> 07:50:43,956
I hate them.

4928
07:50:44,076 --> 07:50:46,799
I still pee hard, so I'll take that.

4929
07:50:47,890 --> 07:50:53,033
But I knew I could come out here in this event, and 200 points on the line, two good workouts for me.

4930
07:50:54,293 --> 07:50:58,655
And I really needed those points back, so I was willing to fight with everything I had to do that.

4931
07:50:59,456 --> 07:51:02,617
And I think I got second and first, so can't complain with that.

4932
07:51:03,078 --> 07:51:04,899
And I'm here to win.

4933
07:51:04,919 --> 07:51:10,982
This is my goal, to give everything to this achievement that I want to achieve.

4934
07:51:11,022 --> 07:51:12,062
And I'm not giving it up yet.

4935
07:51:13,043 --> 07:51:13,763
One more day to go.

4936
07:51:13,783 --> 07:51:15,444
I might not be sitting in a good spot, but

4937
07:51:16,634 --> 07:51:20,155
Yeah, I appreciate all you guys for cheering me on.

4938
07:51:20,295 --> 07:51:26,317
And hopefully that gets me up the leaderboard, and I can fight with everything I've got tomorrow to try and bring it home.

4939
07:51:26,537 --> 07:51:28,057
Well, that's definitely going to push you up the leaderboard.

4940
07:51:28,097 --> 07:51:29,498
Ricky, thank you very much.

4941
07:51:29,558 --> 07:51:30,178
Congratulations.

4942
07:51:30,218 --> 07:51:30,718
We'll see you tomorrow.

4943
07:51:31,018 --> 07:51:31,178
Cool.

4944
07:51:31,198 --> 07:51:31,458
Thank you.

4945
07:51:31,478 --> 07:51:31,918
Thank you, guys.

4946
07:51:34,759 --> 07:51:37,500
Congratulations to James Sprague and Ricky Garrard.

4947
07:51:39,421 --> 07:51:43,362
Not often does the hype live up.

4948
07:51:44,360 --> 07:51:47,344
to the billing, but we had a fantastic race for the men.

4949
07:51:47,624 --> 07:51:48,465
Don't go anywhere.

4950
07:51:48,706 --> 07:51:51,729
It will be the individual women's turn after this.

4951
07:52:20,208 --> 07:52:25,391
I became the owner of CrossFit Spur after being introduced to CrossFit in probably 2010-2011.

4952
07:52:25,432 --> 07:52:30,415
Coached at a local box for a bit.

4953
07:52:30,855 --> 07:52:33,017
Really enjoyed it more than I thought I would.

4954
07:52:33,257 --> 07:52:38,040
Ended up getting my L1 and decided that I'd like to go off of my own and give it a shot.

4955
07:52:38,560 --> 07:52:39,160
Way better.

4956
07:52:39,360 --> 07:52:39,540
Good.

4957
07:52:39,580 --> 07:52:42,161
We're just outside of Albany, a small town called Glenmont.

4958
07:52:43,181 --> 07:52:48,023
I worked in the town that Crossfittsburg is in for many, many years.

4959
07:52:48,383 --> 07:52:49,323
It's a neighboring town.

4960
07:52:49,763 --> 07:52:51,384
Got to know the community really well.

4961
07:52:52,004 --> 07:53:04,788
But after kind of being here and growing through word of mouth, organic growth, and people starting to understand that what we do is make people healthy, we sort of earned a reputation of making people better at anything, no matter what they wanted to do.

4962
07:53:05,828 --> 07:53:09,530
John and Lauren will do just about anything to help anybody get better at anything.

4963
07:53:09,890 --> 07:53:11,350
I'm convinced of that for sure.

4964
07:53:11,490 --> 07:53:13,511
You have an AMRAP for 14 minutes.

4965
07:53:13,551 --> 07:53:18,713
My wife, Lauren, has been a member at the gym for longer than she was an employee here.

4966
07:53:19,013 --> 07:53:27,817
She's an organizer for sure, so she does a great job keeping everything in line, taking care of the boring stuff that people don't quite understand, all the ins and outs of business ownership.

4967
07:53:28,617 --> 07:53:31,719
I don't know that the gym would be able to run without her.

4968
07:53:31,799 --> 07:53:34,500
It certainly would not have been able to expand the way it did without her.

4969
07:53:38,843 --> 07:53:42,707
We are probably the largest in the Capital District, definitely one of the largest.

4970
07:53:43,067 --> 07:53:46,510
We've got 6,500 plus square feet of floor space.

4971
07:53:47,131 --> 07:53:53,597
We've got two rigs, full corral of bikes and rowers and all the endurance machines you could possibly want.

4972
07:53:54,438 --> 07:53:58,120
COVID hit, the reality set in that we might not be opening for quite a while.

4973
07:53:58,360 --> 07:54:00,901
We ended up creating sort of a fitness library.

4974
07:54:00,961 --> 07:54:02,502
We labeled all of our equipment.

4975
07:54:02,782 --> 07:54:06,725
And we allowed our members to come in twice a week and swap out their equipment.

4976
07:54:06,945 --> 07:54:08,485
So they each got to take two pieces home.

4977
07:54:08,966 --> 07:54:10,667
But through that, we didn't lose a single member.

4978
07:54:11,627 --> 07:54:18,572
In addition to the CrossFit space, we have some offices next door where we've got a therapy room with contrast therapy.

4979
07:54:18,592 --> 07:54:19,392
We have a cold plunge.

4980
07:54:19,472 --> 07:54:20,393
We have a sauna.

4981
07:54:20,913 --> 07:54:22,434
We've also got a barber shop.

4982
07:54:22,674 --> 07:54:25,916
We have two massage therapists that are here full time.

4983
07:54:26,116 --> 07:54:27,377
We've also got a chiropractor.

4984
07:54:27,557 --> 07:54:31,460
We've got a little bit of everything to offer for anyone looking to get healthy.

4985
07:54:33,733 --> 07:54:36,577
I've been a member here at CrossFit Spur for 10 years.

4986
07:54:37,438 --> 07:54:40,081
It's just grown and grown and grown, this business.

4987
07:54:40,501 --> 07:54:42,744
Doubled, almost tripled the size of it.

4988
07:54:43,085 --> 07:54:47,049
So many new members, so many members that have been here for quite a long time, as long as me.

4989
07:54:47,630 --> 07:54:48,331
So it's really great.

4990
07:54:49,252 --> 07:54:54,414
I moved here during grad school, and honestly, if it wasn't for this community here, I probably still wouldn't live here.

4991
07:54:54,714 --> 07:54:56,795
John and Lauren have created such a great atmosphere.

4992
07:54:57,115 --> 07:54:58,536
Everybody here is like-minded.

4993
07:54:58,776 --> 07:54:59,856
Everybody supports each other.

4994
07:54:59,876 --> 07:55:03,258
His programming is fantastic.

4995
07:55:03,518 --> 07:55:08,720
And what's really impressive, when the people don't know this, they don't realize what goes into the coaching aspect.

4996
07:55:09,020 --> 07:55:14,042
They don't see the notes that I see from him saying, this is what I want you to focus on today.

4997
07:55:14,102 --> 07:55:15,063
Make sure they do this.

4998
07:55:15,163 --> 07:55:15,983
Don't let them do this.

4999
07:55:16,623 --> 07:55:17,604
I want you to check this.

5000
07:55:18,025 --> 07:55:19,326
He's not throwing stuff together.

5001
07:55:19,346 --> 07:55:20,627
It gives you a different perspective.

5002
07:55:20,847 --> 07:55:22,529
It's not just a place they go work out.

5003
07:55:22,889 --> 07:55:23,990
This is where their friends are.

5004
07:55:24,391 --> 07:55:25,932
This is where they enjoy spending time.

5005
07:55:26,833 --> 07:55:33,159
It makes going to the gym something that they want to do, which I think is part of the reason that we've grown the way we have.

5006
07:55:33,179 --> 07:55:34,661
It's their place.

5007
07:55:46,904 --> 07:55:49,611
What's the key component when we look at functional movements?

5008
07:55:49,631 --> 07:55:50,393
What are we looking for?

5009
07:55:51,321 --> 07:55:53,222
The ability to move a large load.

5010
07:55:53,502 --> 07:55:54,543
Long distances.

5011
07:55:54,763 --> 07:55:55,063
Quickly.

5012
07:55:55,284 --> 07:55:55,984
Ready, and go.

5013
07:55:56,064 --> 07:55:56,744
And now reach up.

5014
07:55:56,885 --> 07:56:03,088
Mastering the nine foundational movements is key to building strong, efficient CrossFit skills.

5015
07:56:03,168 --> 07:56:06,010
The squat, front squat, and the overhead squat.

5016
07:56:06,130 --> 07:56:11,634
The press, push press, push jerk, deadlift, sumo deadlift, high pull, and the med ball clean.

5017
07:56:11,854 --> 07:56:18,378
We can basically break down all of our human and athletic movement to a foundation of these movements.

5018
07:56:18,738 --> 07:56:21,779
And stand, missy, send your hip back a little bit more.

5019
07:56:21,919 --> 07:56:28,742
These movements teach essential themes like core stability, posterior chain engagement, and full range of motion across the joints.

5020
07:56:29,643 --> 07:56:32,444
Skills that transfer to many other functional movements.

5021
07:56:33,124 --> 07:56:39,427
Get these right and you'll have the foundation to confidently move, lift, and thrive.

5022
07:59:01,119 --> 07:59:01,279
you

5023
08:00:00,170 --> 08:00:01,600
I'm calling out

5024
08:02:12,708 --> 08:02:12,768
So,

5025
08:07:06,697 --> 08:07:08,338
Running it back one more time.

5026
08:07:09,418 --> 08:07:17,101
We're at Albany, New York, inside the MVP arena for the 2025 CrossFit Games.

5027
08:07:18,141 --> 08:07:22,043
As we're closing things out on a Saturday night with the individual women.

5028
08:07:22,083 --> 08:07:33,807
And this is a testament to the volunteers breaking down the squats from event five and check out how much work goes into it.

5029
08:07:34,587 --> 08:07:36,448
Nothing is possible without our volunteers.

5030
08:07:36,908 --> 08:07:39,348
No, years of competing on the competition floor, man.

5031
08:07:39,388 --> 08:07:49,331
You see behind the lens of every single event that is almost completely supported by people willing to sacrifice their time and effort as volunteers.

5032
08:07:49,371 --> 08:07:49,811
And you love it.

5033
08:07:49,831 --> 08:07:54,593
They get to say, of course, that they were part of the inner workings of putting on the 2025 CrossFit Games.

5034
08:07:54,833 --> 08:07:59,234
And of course, they get to peel back the layers and see behind the whole engine that puts this thing through.

5035
08:07:59,254 --> 08:08:02,095
You can see the different color shirts representing different

5036
08:08:04,780 --> 08:08:12,463
Sections of our volunteer crew, judges, medical staff, scoring, equipment team, athlete control, security.

5037
08:08:13,644 --> 08:08:14,624
Absolutely incredible.

5038
08:08:14,844 --> 08:08:20,247
Absolutely will not be possible without our volunteers.

5039
08:08:21,855 --> 08:08:28,100
Still trying to catch my breath from the men as we get set for the women's turn for individuals six and seven.

5040
08:08:28,660 --> 08:08:30,922
Throttle down, throttle up, hammer down.

5041
08:08:31,062 --> 08:08:31,563
That's right.

5042
08:08:31,583 --> 08:08:34,585
Well, Chase, catch your breath quickly, brother, because you know what happens fast.

5043
08:08:34,605 --> 08:08:47,895
It's 35 calories on the skier, 28 chest-to-bar pull-ups, and 24 box over burpees with a 16-pound vest with a one-minute transition and rest into a 35-calorie C2 bike, then 28-bar muscle-ups

5044
08:08:50,297 --> 08:08:54,359
and 24 burpee box jump overs with a hard time cap of eight minutes.

5045
08:08:54,859 --> 08:08:57,721
Andrew, what is your tempo recipe for success?

5046
08:08:58,461 --> 08:09:00,582
On this first one, it's going to be full send.

5047
08:09:00,642 --> 08:09:06,526
You want to be one of the first people off of that skier if you want to have success at a high-level finish in event six.

5048
08:09:06,906 --> 08:09:09,127
And for event seven, it's a different approach.

5049
08:09:09,167 --> 08:09:10,428
It's pace and break.

5050
08:09:10,468 --> 08:09:12,409
We're specifically talking about those bar muscle-ups.

5051
08:09:12,869 --> 08:09:16,811
Very calculated risk versus reward if you go all the way to failure there.

5052
08:09:19,378 --> 08:09:22,099
Your lane assignments for heat number one.

5053
08:09:22,380 --> 08:09:23,800
We have three total heats of 10.

5054
08:09:23,880 --> 08:09:29,123
We're closing things out here tonight on a Saturday in MVP Arena.

5055
08:09:31,104 --> 08:09:38,248
Your vision fuels victory athletes to watch Sung Young Choi competing in her fourth CrossFit Games.

5056
08:09:39,207 --> 08:09:51,230
Yeah, she comes here as a tenured athlete now, four times at the CrossFit Games, finishing 24th last year in 2024, and looking to finish in a higher placing every single year.

5057
08:09:51,290 --> 08:09:54,310
Right now sitting in 26, she's got to put herself higher on the leaderboard.

5058
08:09:54,810 --> 08:09:59,331
And you have Maria Camila Quintero, and this is her second time competing.

5059
08:10:00,031 --> 08:10:01,932
She hasn't qualified as an individual since 2019.

5060
08:10:03,797 --> 08:10:07,639
Yeah, she's one of those great athletes, Chase, that has towed the line on both sides.

5061
08:10:07,659 --> 08:10:10,601
She was a team athlete three times, and now here's an individual again.

5062
08:10:10,621 --> 08:10:20,107
Event number six, no change in reps between the men and the women.

5063
08:10:20,147 --> 08:10:22,869
We don't often see that when we talk machine work.

5064
08:10:24,033 --> 08:10:29,839
Yeah, and this is one of those things where we understand because we're stationary, mass moving mass is a huge advantage.

5065
08:10:29,879 --> 08:10:36,947
So what we're asking is that the women are essentially responsible for a touch more work being that often in stature and in body weight.

5066
08:10:38,303 --> 08:10:41,947
They compare in smaller size than the athletes for the most part.

5067
08:10:41,967 --> 08:10:45,851
And that's going to demand more work for them to accomplish that 35 calories on the skier.

5068
08:10:46,191 --> 08:10:49,775
Still going to be an all out race, but probably going to hit that at just a touch slower tempo.

5069
08:10:50,456 --> 08:10:55,601
Does that make the first part on the machines more important to the success in this event?

5070
08:10:56,683 --> 08:10:58,605
I think that what we'll see is more variability.

5071
08:10:59,568 --> 08:11:13,811
I don't know that it's any more important, but I do believe that there will be a greater disparity in the time off from the first athlete to the last here, especially as we sequentially go through heat after heat, making our way closer towards that heat one, or heat three, I'm sorry.

5072
08:11:14,231 --> 08:11:15,191
Past the minute mark.

5073
08:11:16,591 --> 08:11:21,012
Summer athletes have a little less than 10 cows remaining.

5074
08:11:21,072 --> 08:11:24,072
Mariana Meza, one of those athletes.

5075
08:11:25,813 --> 08:11:26,653
The number to get to is 35.

5076
08:11:29,982 --> 08:11:32,264
After the skier, they'll advance to the pull-up bar.

5077
08:11:35,266 --> 08:11:40,831
For 28 chest-to-bar pull-ups, wearing that 16-pound vest.

5078
08:11:41,972 --> 08:11:45,775
Now, a better consideration here, Chase, is will we see them break up the reps of the 28?

5079
08:11:45,875 --> 08:11:49,678
We didn't see one male intentionally break off for the 28 chest-to-bars.

5080
08:11:50,619 --> 08:11:51,740
Will the women have a different approach?

5081
08:11:52,821 --> 08:11:59,006
First to the rig is Mariana Meza on the left and Alexis Raptis on the right.

5082
08:12:02,178 --> 08:12:05,780
both moving extremely fluidly through those butterfly chest-to-bar pull-ups.

5083
08:12:05,800 --> 08:12:08,461
We see DeRoy there in the middle of our screen right beside Raptis.

5084
08:12:13,803 --> 08:12:17,624
The number to get to is 63, and Raptis will be done.

5085
08:12:18,005 --> 08:12:19,285
She's onto the box at the 2.15 mark.

5086
08:12:19,305 --> 08:12:21,446
24 burpee box jumpovers at 20 inches.

5087
08:12:31,497 --> 08:12:43,882
Remember, that standard is that these athletes have to do three burpee box jump overs at each box before advancing, and they have to step down until that third burpee box jump over in which they can clear the box however they'd like to advance forward.

5088
08:12:43,902 --> 08:12:53,225
Alexis Raptis and Mariana Mesa still side by side as they are six reps in working on the set of nine.

5089
08:12:54,085 --> 08:12:57,987
All athletes will do three burpee box jump overs.

5090
08:12:58,973 --> 08:13:00,213
And there are eight boxes.

5091
08:13:00,954 --> 08:13:04,134
There are 80 boxes on the competition floor.

5092
08:13:06,435 --> 08:13:07,875
We are past the three minute mark.

5093
08:13:08,676 --> 08:13:11,096
Alexis Raptis in the yellow shoes in the center lane.

5094
08:13:13,337 --> 08:13:17,518
Past the halfway point on these Burpee Box Jump Overs.

5095
08:13:19,919 --> 08:13:22,920
Maya De Mesa on the left in lane number one is not going anywhere.

5096
08:13:22,940 --> 08:13:27,541
Alexis Raptis, nine reps left to go.

5097
08:13:29,196 --> 08:13:36,721
And this is where that 16 pounds of excess weight starts to feel a lot more heavy on your triceps and your shoulders as you press out every rep of one of these burpees.

5098
08:13:38,062 --> 08:13:39,463
Time cap, six minutes.

5099
08:13:41,104 --> 08:13:44,326
As Raptis has six more burpee box jumpovers to go.

5100
08:13:49,690 --> 08:13:53,012
No slowing for Alexis, looking great on these burpee box jumpovers.

5101
08:13:54,493 --> 08:13:55,974
Raptis is on her final three.

5102
08:13:59,618 --> 08:14:00,939
Approaching the four-minute mark.

5103
08:14:01,439 --> 08:14:02,459
Two minutes to the cap.

5104
08:14:02,479 --> 08:14:10,563
She's not going to need it, but she will set the time to beat.

5105
08:14:10,583 --> 08:14:19,007
4.05.33 for Alexis Raptis, as Messa dies over the finish line to try to out-sprint Sung Young Choi.

5106
08:14:21,107 --> 08:14:21,948
Adekanyo's in.

5107
08:14:24,917 --> 08:14:31,601
Now the men didn't need it, but that time cap is going to come into play potentially on the women's side.

5108
08:14:36,783 --> 08:14:40,606
Yeah, we're going to see some athletes come very close to that six minute mark here.

5109
08:14:41,406 --> 08:14:42,346
We talk about the difference.

5110
08:14:42,387 --> 08:14:45,028
A lot of that difference is made up there on those calories on the skier.

5111
08:14:45,708 --> 08:14:48,510
DeRoy still navigating her final burpee box jump overs here.

5112
08:14:51,692 --> 08:14:52,272
She's across.

5113
08:14:56,662 --> 08:14:58,423
Unofficially 450 for DeRoy.

5114
08:14:58,444 --> 08:15:01,186
Mejas still maneuvering through.

5115
08:15:01,206 --> 08:15:05,750
Got one minute before he hit that five or six minute cap.

5116
08:15:06,770 --> 08:15:07,651
Mejas done.

5117
08:15:07,671 --> 08:15:13,616
We have two athletes left on the floor.

5118
08:15:14,957 --> 08:15:16,719
Make that one, Quintero's in.

5119
08:15:20,242 --> 08:15:21,483
And Luis and Marquez.

5120
08:15:23,865 --> 08:15:25,206
Athletes can shed the vest.

5121
08:15:26,497 --> 08:15:35,974
and get as much recovery as they can until we hit the six minute cap and then they will have 60 seconds to get across the floor and get set for event number seven.

5122
08:15:38,343 --> 08:15:42,384
And right now, Alexis is trying to put as much effort and energy into recovery as possible.

5123
08:15:42,404 --> 08:15:43,885
You'll notice her shaking her extremities.

5124
08:15:44,305 --> 08:15:46,505
She's trying to flush away as much lactate as she can.

5125
08:15:46,525 --> 08:15:48,866
That's a burning sensation that starts to accumulate.

5126
08:15:49,466 --> 08:15:57,488
Anytime we really start to go through any physical activity or exertion that is towards our threshold, which means you're pushing hard, you're going to get that accumulation.

5127
08:15:57,988 --> 08:16:00,749
And she's trying to shake it before it's time to sit back down on that bike and get after it.

5128
08:16:00,769 --> 08:16:03,410
So we have these highlights presented by Rogue Fitness.

5129
08:16:04,398 --> 08:16:07,820
Yeah, it was Alexis Raptus early in this event.

5130
08:16:08,220 --> 08:16:10,081
She came out aggressive on the skier.

5131
08:16:10,761 --> 08:16:13,983
We had a little bit of back and forth all the way through the Chester bar.

5132
08:16:14,003 --> 08:16:19,685
But Alexis, with her smooth and fluid movement, I mean, extremely efficient in her gymnastics.

5133
08:16:20,065 --> 08:16:23,047
And then it was her willingness to lean in and suffer on the burpee.

5134
08:16:23,067 --> 08:16:28,649
She started to create a bit more separation between her and Marina Meza.

5135
08:16:29,690 --> 08:16:31,471
And she was the first one across the finish line.

5136
08:16:32,577 --> 08:16:38,018
And the question is, can she repeat this performance for event number seven?

5137
08:16:38,858 --> 08:16:44,299
Raptis, 405.33, with Nessa six seconds behind her.

5138
08:16:46,980 --> 08:16:50,541
Event number seven, same reps, different movements.

5139
08:16:51,341 --> 08:16:52,901
Different movements, and it's a short turnaround.

5140
08:16:53,321 --> 08:16:54,922
35 calories this time on the C2 bike.

5141
08:16:54,942 --> 08:16:57,122
That's why we saw Alexis shaking out those legs, getting ready.

5142
08:16:57,142 --> 08:17:00,683
28-bar muscle-ups and 24 burpee box jumpovers.

5143
08:17:03,984 --> 08:17:06,305
Heat one of three for event number seven.

5144
08:17:09,006 --> 08:17:10,706
35 cows on the concept two bike.

5145
08:17:14,027 --> 08:17:16,548
So we get an idea of whose strategies were what.

5146
08:17:17,588 --> 08:17:20,009
We've seen a variety of on the men's side.

5147
08:17:22,189 --> 08:17:24,810
Sending the first one and surviving the second.

5148
08:17:26,071 --> 08:17:27,031
As Alexis Raptis.

5149
08:17:28,637 --> 08:17:31,879
is hoping to have a back-to-back good performance.

5150
08:17:31,939 --> 08:17:34,300
Hasn't had the games that we know she wanted.

5151
08:17:34,320 --> 08:17:39,763
Yeah, doesn't look like herself, Chase.

5152
08:17:40,384 --> 08:17:47,928
You know, when we think about the fitness that she's amassed through her years, and we think about what she can do at a high level, even under pressure.

5153
08:17:48,987 --> 08:17:51,347
just doesn't look like the athlete that we're used to seeing show up here.

5154
08:17:51,387 --> 08:17:53,868
Now, it could be an off day or two, and we're going to start to see that.

5155
08:17:53,928 --> 08:17:58,929
This is a great opportunity, though, for her, again, to reconcile some of the points in regards to a deficit of where she's sitting.

5156
08:18:03,990 --> 08:18:12,351
Sungyoung Choi, who closed hard on those last 24 burpees, is trying to chase down Alexis Raptis and Mariana Mesa.

5157
08:18:13,951 --> 08:18:17,472
And four-time CrossFit Games athlete,

5158
08:18:19,692 --> 08:18:22,534
actually qualified out of Wadlen Fest this year.

5159
08:18:22,554 --> 08:18:25,717
She's out of the Republic of Korea.

5160
08:18:26,658 --> 08:18:28,039
Goes across at Limelight.

5161
08:18:30,801 --> 08:18:33,763
There are a lot of fans at home cheering her on.

5162
08:18:37,946 --> 08:18:40,048
Raptors only three calories left now, down to two.

5163
08:18:40,728 --> 08:18:41,389
Good forward lean.

5164
08:18:41,429 --> 08:18:42,970
Notice that her elbows are bent there.

5165
08:18:43,010 --> 08:18:47,554
She's leaning on her arms in a forearm position so that she doesn't have to waste energy in her triceps.

5166
08:18:48,394 --> 08:18:48,775
Bent move.

5167
08:18:51,228 --> 08:18:52,509
Raptis is on the rig.

5168
08:18:52,529 --> 08:18:55,772
What about the 1.48 mark?

5169
08:18:58,615 --> 08:19:03,519
Adekanyo and Sung Young Choi close behind.

5170
08:19:07,143 --> 08:19:09,625
The number to get to at the top of your screen is 63.

5171
08:19:09,745 --> 08:19:14,549
We are just past the two minute mark here in event number seven, heat number one.

5172
08:19:18,045 --> 08:19:23,286
Emily DeRoy on the left side of your screens on her bar muscle-ups along with Sierra Mejia.

5173
08:19:25,567 --> 08:19:27,667
Carolyn Frivo on the left side of your screen as well.

5174
08:19:28,667 --> 08:19:29,928
All athletes on the rig.

5175
08:19:31,548 --> 08:19:32,428
28 bar muscle-ups.

5176
08:19:37,490 --> 08:19:39,050
Raptis at the top part of your screen.

5177
08:19:41,784 --> 08:19:43,145
14 reps left to go.

5178
08:19:43,165 --> 08:19:44,505
She's at 49 total.

5179
08:19:44,545 --> 08:19:45,926
The number she needs to get to is 63.

5180
08:19:46,446 --> 08:19:48,227
This is her second break.

5181
08:19:48,267 --> 08:19:53,509
We saw a lot of athletes on the men's side break this once, perhaps twice.

5182
08:19:53,549 --> 08:19:55,049
So they did it in three different sets.

5183
08:19:56,650 --> 08:19:59,511
A lot of the women might take one to two extra breaks.

5184
08:19:59,551 --> 08:20:02,092
And it's all about how they manage and anticipate that.

5185
08:20:02,472 --> 08:20:04,153
They want to push, but can never reach failure.

5186
08:20:04,173 --> 08:20:06,414
Otherwise, they're going to have to stand around a lot longer to recover.

5187
08:20:10,662 --> 08:20:12,944
Raptus has about nine reps left to go.

5188
08:20:12,964 --> 08:20:20,450
On the right side of your screen, Hattie Kanyo is closing the gap, and she is matched up with her.

5189
08:20:21,410 --> 08:20:25,994
Just as Raptus is back on the rig, but those reps are looking hard to come by.

5190
08:20:26,354 --> 08:20:28,076
Much more labored for Raptus there.

5191
08:20:28,136 --> 08:20:35,882
Yeah, you'll notice Chase, she's having to drive much harder with her lower body to get the transition, and then even wait for her heels to come up to help her triceps lock out each rep.

5192
08:20:36,923 --> 08:20:38,003
but she made it for that set.

5193
08:20:38,524 --> 08:20:40,724
Four reps left for Raptis.

5194
08:20:41,745 --> 08:20:46,126
Mariana Meza, you can see at the top part of your screen is one rep behind her.

5195
08:20:46,146 --> 08:20:48,547
Patacano too.

5196
08:20:50,968 --> 08:20:52,308
Raptis back up to the rig.

5197
08:20:55,289 --> 08:20:57,690
Can she hang on and get to the box?

5198
08:20:57,750 --> 08:20:59,150
We're at the four minute mark.

5199
08:20:59,970 --> 08:21:01,311
The time cap is eight.

5200
08:21:04,269 --> 08:21:05,490
One more for Raptis.

5201
08:21:06,171 --> 08:21:10,294
She is off.

5202
08:21:10,314 --> 08:21:11,655
24 burpee box jump overs.

5203
08:21:12,296 --> 08:21:13,477
No vest this time.

5204
08:21:14,878 --> 08:21:15,679
Messes off.

5205
08:21:16,739 --> 08:21:18,141
Two reps behind Raptis.

5206
08:21:19,982 --> 08:21:24,306
They'll do three at each box in advance forward for eight total sections.

5207
08:21:26,127 --> 08:21:31,668
This is where Raptis as a veteran is going to know all the other women are just waiting to see what the time to beat is going to be.

5208
08:21:31,708 --> 08:21:33,209
And she's got that internal drive.

5209
08:21:33,669 --> 08:21:37,529
I got to go regardless of where everyone else is, regardless of how many reps ahead she feels.

5210
08:21:37,990 --> 08:21:39,970
She's got to push her internal threshold.

5211
08:21:40,490 --> 08:21:41,970
She's got to max herself out right now.

5212
08:21:44,391 --> 08:21:49,212
Maxing out was no more apparent than we saw in that men's final heat previously.

5213
08:21:50,701 --> 08:21:54,384
Honestly, as an athlete, that's not something I want to see before it's my turn.

5214
08:21:55,484 --> 08:21:57,066
You don't want to see that at all, Chase.

5215
08:21:57,106 --> 08:21:58,567
That is very similar to a kid.

5216
08:21:58,607 --> 08:22:03,870
You and your sibling are both lined up for spankings, and you watch your sibling get the spanking first, and then you know what's coming.

5217
08:22:04,071 --> 08:22:06,753
The classic, you're with your partner, and you're in the gym.

5218
08:22:06,793 --> 08:22:08,013
It's like, do you want to go first or me?

5219
08:22:08,654 --> 08:22:10,956
You never want to go first until it's your time to go second.

5220
08:22:11,576 --> 08:22:13,778
Christina Olivedadakis has moved into third place.

5221
08:22:13,798 --> 08:22:15,179
She's on the right side of your screen.

5222
08:22:16,701 --> 08:22:24,228
Alektis Raptis in the center lane still holding on a two-rep lead over Mariana Meza who's in lane number one.

5223
08:22:31,194 --> 08:22:33,295
Six more reps for Raptis.

5224
08:22:33,435 --> 08:22:44,205
She's starting to extend her lead a little bit on Meza over in lane one on the left side.

5225
08:22:45,700 --> 08:22:46,360
Three more.

5226
08:22:47,861 --> 08:22:51,944
Caroline Prevost in lane two is trying to pass Meza.

5227
08:22:53,284 --> 08:22:54,685
Two more reps for Raptis.

5228
08:22:55,566 --> 08:22:57,367
Final, burpee over the box.

5229
08:22:58,087 --> 08:23:03,070
And Raptis goes back to back in six and seven.

5230
08:23:08,933 --> 08:23:11,835
Wow, Lividutakis with amazing cycle rate on her burpees.

5231
08:23:13,396 --> 08:23:14,677
Made up a lot of ground there.

5232
08:23:17,557 --> 08:23:21,299
Brevo sneaks in just ahead of Christina.

5233
08:23:24,001 --> 08:23:25,502
And let the fire drill begin.

5234
08:23:25,522 --> 08:23:29,125
A little stop, drop, and roll on the finish line.

5235
08:23:29,145 --> 08:23:37,350
90 seconds before we hit the eight minute cap.

5236
08:23:37,670 --> 08:23:38,651
Quintero is done.

5237
08:23:40,682 --> 08:23:43,043
Better finish in seven than she had in six.

5238
08:23:46,946 --> 08:23:48,467
Same thing with Luisa Mett.

5239
08:23:49,967 --> 08:23:50,528
Marquez.

5240
08:23:54,250 --> 08:23:55,931
On the left side of Emily DeRoy.

5241
08:23:57,032 --> 08:23:59,873
And then on the right, Syria Meja.

5242
08:24:08,738 --> 08:24:10,899
what we've been saw, chased, and talked about.

5243
08:24:11,220 --> 08:24:14,001
Was it a good idea to come out and win, or do you want to leave a little in the tank?

5244
08:24:14,402 --> 08:24:15,883
Alexis Raptors was the first one to do that.

5245
08:24:16,743 --> 08:24:17,624
Take back to back.

5246
08:24:21,246 --> 08:24:22,007
May has in.

5247
08:24:22,027 --> 08:24:23,768
40 seconds until the cap.

5248
08:24:28,971 --> 08:24:30,672
Two athletes left on the floor.

5249
08:24:31,212 --> 08:24:33,454
One of those is Emily DeRoy.

5250
08:24:34,575 --> 08:24:37,056
The other is Sung Young Choi.

5251
08:24:39,565 --> 08:24:40,465
Sun Young Choi.

5252
08:24:40,485 --> 08:24:49,529
Looks like she put all her eggs in the event six basket.

5253
08:24:51,830 --> 08:24:54,792
We knew she was coming on strong at the end with those burpees.

5254
08:24:55,512 --> 08:24:57,793
And right now she's just paying the price.

5255
08:24:58,373 --> 08:25:00,494
Not one that she probably wouldn't exchange anyways.

5256
08:25:00,974 --> 08:25:02,435
She knew what she was getting herself into.

5257
08:25:04,676 --> 08:25:06,357
And that'll do it for heat number one.

5258
08:25:07,570 --> 08:25:11,555
As Alexis Raptis goes back to back in event six and event seven.

5259
08:25:13,177 --> 08:25:17,102
We still have two more heats remaining for the women.

5260
08:25:17,643 --> 08:25:19,786
Your highlights presented by Rogue Fitness.

5261
08:25:21,152 --> 08:25:31,879
These women didn't have much time to recover coming into event seven as they only get a one minute transition, but they sat down on that C2 bike and Alexis Raptis came out aggressive just as she did in event six.

5262
08:25:32,179 --> 08:25:35,521
This put her in a very unique situation to of course lead the charge.

5263
08:25:35,541 --> 08:25:40,484
We haven't seen many lead exchanges happen throughout the course of these 24 burpee box jump overs.

5264
08:25:40,765 --> 08:25:50,331
And she is now leading the way as the first athlete to take an event six win and then followed up with a back-to-back dub in event number seven, Alexis Raptis.

5265
08:25:51,584 --> 08:25:57,029
Raftis sets the time to beat once again at 6 minutes, 0.39 seconds.

5266
08:25:58,570 --> 08:25:59,771
As Heat One is done.

5267
08:26:00,832 --> 08:26:02,334
Two more heats remaining.

5268
08:26:02,694 --> 08:26:03,655
Coming up after this.

5269
08:28:03,457 --> 08:28:07,200
The 2025 CrossFit Games continues here in MVP Arena.

5270
08:28:09,141 --> 08:28:12,883
As heat number two is making their way on the competition floor.

5271
08:28:12,944 --> 08:28:15,425
I'm Chase Ingram, along with me is Adrian Conway.

5272
08:28:15,465 --> 08:28:17,687
We'll be joined by Mike Arsenault shortly.

5273
08:28:19,988 --> 08:28:23,431
As we have events six and seven, throttle up, hammer down.

5274
08:28:24,587 --> 08:28:27,309
They are doozies, and they go by fast, especially number six.

5275
08:28:27,389 --> 08:28:29,030
It's for time with a vest.

5276
08:28:29,050 --> 08:28:35,853
16 pounds approximately, 35 calories on the skier, 28 chest-to-bar pull-ups, and 24 burpee box jump-overs.

5277
08:28:35,873 --> 08:28:44,278
With a one-minute rest transition after that six-minute cap, it's 35 calories on the C2 bike, 28-bar muscle-ups, and 24 burpee box jump-overs.

5278
08:28:44,318 --> 08:28:45,879
But this time, no vest.

5279
08:28:46,600 --> 08:28:47,600
Back-to-back events.

5280
08:28:47,640 --> 08:28:51,182
We'll be starting with event number six, presented by Border Patrol.

5281
08:28:51,222 --> 08:28:51,983
Your start list.

5282
08:28:52,987 --> 08:28:57,557
for heat number two and in lane number two out of Scotland.

5283
08:28:59,183 --> 08:29:02,705
Jennifer Muir, it's like a second place finish in that last event.

5284
08:29:02,805 --> 08:29:03,305
More on her.

5285
08:29:03,325 --> 08:29:04,465
Let's go down to Mike Arsenault.

5286
08:29:04,805 --> 08:29:05,266
Thanks, Chase.

5287
08:29:05,306 --> 08:29:10,188
Yeah, Jen is one of four female athletes from the UK in her first appearance at the Games.

5288
08:29:10,268 --> 08:29:12,949
And she had a bit of a struggle on day one of the competition.

5289
08:29:12,969 --> 08:29:17,311
But as you mentioned, a second place in the back squat, 355 pounds.

5290
08:29:17,571 --> 08:29:20,212
Can she build on that for event six and event seven?

5291
08:29:20,492 --> 08:29:25,634
Well, while she was warming up for these two events in the warm up area, she's dealing with a blister issue on her hand.

5292
08:29:25,674 --> 08:29:26,775
So that will make the

5293
08:29:27,255 --> 08:29:30,056
chest-to-bar pull-ups and the bar muscle-ups that much more difficult.

5294
08:29:30,116 --> 08:29:38,278
Of course, she has some grips on her hands that will help alleviate that a little bit, but look for potential hand issues for Jen throughout these next two events.

5295
08:29:38,879 --> 08:29:39,539
Thank you, Mike.

5296
08:29:39,599 --> 08:29:46,841
And our vision fuels victory athletes to watch Lexi Neely, who had an event win last year at the 2024 CrossFit Games.

5297
08:29:47,401 --> 08:29:50,482
Looking to make a move back up the leaderboard here in event number six.

5298
08:29:51,963 --> 08:29:52,663
Haley Adams.

5299
08:29:53,822 --> 08:30:01,029
has not had the cleanest run so far, but she has two opportunities to get back to business.

5300
08:30:04,633 --> 08:30:16,385
35 cows on the skier, 28 chest-to-bar pull-ups, 24 burpees over the box, all wearing that 16-pound vest for event number six.

5301
08:30:19,708 --> 08:30:22,369
As we watch these athletes, you want to maximize two things.

5302
08:30:23,089 --> 08:30:24,130
One is your stroke rate.

5303
08:30:24,290 --> 08:30:27,771
So that means you want to hinge down and stand up quickly.

5304
08:30:28,331 --> 08:30:30,672
But the other is your stroke power.

5305
08:30:31,032 --> 08:30:37,934
You have to pull down with ferocity, sending the hips back and down, driving through your heels every time and reaching high with those straps.

5306
08:30:37,954 --> 08:30:40,215
That is how you get the greatest reward on the ski yard.

5307
08:30:43,778 --> 08:30:45,539
Just past the 42nd mark.

5308
08:30:45,579 --> 08:30:49,320
We just watched Alexis Raptis in the previous heat go back to back.

5309
08:30:49,360 --> 08:30:52,221
The only athlete to do so so far.

5310
08:30:53,442 --> 08:30:58,064
Raptis was done with the skier at the minute 42 mark.

5311
08:30:59,064 --> 08:31:01,265
The running clock in the upper left corner of your screen.

5312
08:31:01,305 --> 08:31:05,347
We are past the one minute mark as Visagophi is at 20 cows.

5313
08:31:10,462 --> 08:31:12,062
A lot of athletes to keep your eye on.

5314
08:31:12,082 --> 08:31:15,183
Visa Goffey, Abby Doman, Claudia Gluck.

5315
08:31:15,683 --> 08:31:20,605
Claudia Gluck actually had a fantastic performance last year in the finale with two back-to-back events.

5316
08:31:23,445 --> 08:31:28,027
And this is a opportunity to get yourself into the top 10 going into Sunday.

5317
08:31:28,047 --> 08:31:35,949
Holding on to that 11th place position, tied in points, is Claudia Gluck and Brooke Wells.

5318
08:31:39,727 --> 08:31:49,654
And Brooks going going for it Haley's going for it Danielle Brandon also going to be close to getting off But it's Haley Adams leading the way Add him to the rig first.

5319
08:31:49,694 --> 08:32:04,165
He's in the left side of your screen in lane number three The time split off the pull-up bars to 13 The time to beat as we're passing the two-minute mark said by Alexis Raptis is four oh five point three three and

5320
08:32:07,030 --> 08:32:09,131
Your top five times in heat number one.

5321
08:32:10,592 --> 08:32:13,694
Raftis holds your top time.

5322
08:32:13,934 --> 08:32:14,914
Men's at 4'11", 4'13".

5323
08:32:14,934 --> 08:32:21,898
If it's anything like the men, seconds are vital as Haley Adams is back to the box.

5324
08:32:22,598 --> 08:32:24,179
And Brooke Wells got a no rep.

5325
08:32:24,219 --> 08:32:26,180
Yeah, costly, especially on that last rep.

5326
08:32:28,421 --> 08:32:31,743
Daniel Brayden in between Haley Adams and Brooke Wells.

5327
08:32:32,163 --> 08:32:34,985
McGonigal going rep for rep right now with Haley Adams.

5328
08:32:36,277 --> 08:32:44,762
McGonigal down in lane number nine on the far right side of your screen as Haley Adams is keeping pace and moving ahead.

5329
08:32:45,463 --> 08:32:46,883
Here comes Danielle Brandon.

5330
08:32:49,685 --> 08:32:54,348
When we get to the box, it's more about grit and athleticism.

5331
08:32:55,757 --> 08:32:59,460
And McGonigal right now on the right of your screen is the one showing the most urgency.

5332
08:32:59,640 --> 08:33:05,564
Her transitions over the box, she's keeping her hips low, and she's diving right to the ground to get that plate down with her chest to follow.

5333
08:33:06,104 --> 08:33:07,905
We're at the fourth box of eight.

5334
08:33:07,945 --> 08:33:13,509
Alexis Radtis is at 308, and so is Danielle Brandon and Haley Adams.

5335
08:33:19,253 --> 08:33:22,095
Lucy McGonigal has now pulled ahead.

5336
08:33:23,378 --> 08:33:26,119
McGonigal on the far right side of your screen in light green.

5337
08:33:26,399 --> 08:33:34,640
The youngest athlete in the field is trying to keep ahead of Danielle Brandon and Haley Adams.

5338
08:33:34,780 --> 08:33:36,181
She's got about a second on her.

5339
08:33:37,881 --> 08:33:42,402
She has 30 seconds to get four more.

5340
08:33:42,722 --> 08:33:46,063
Make that three, and Lucy McGonigal

5341
08:33:48,590 --> 08:33:54,352
has an opportunity to set the tide of beat with Danielle Brandon breathing down her neck.

5342
08:33:56,893 --> 08:33:57,973
McGonagall will do it.

5343
08:33:58,073 --> 08:33:58,453
Wow.

5344
08:33:58,993 --> 08:34:02,515
Brandon made a strong push there at the end on those burpee box jump overs.

5345
08:34:02,975 --> 08:34:03,855
Brandon is in.

5346
08:34:05,756 --> 08:34:06,676
Fee Sagafi.

5347
08:34:09,117 --> 08:34:15,039
Haley Adams, then Raptis' time is good enough for fourth overall.

5348
08:34:16,780 --> 08:34:18,641
Still have one heat remaining.

5349
08:34:22,444 --> 08:34:23,725
So Lucy McGonigal.

5350
08:34:25,646 --> 08:34:26,947
Abby Domitz across there.

5351
08:34:27,868 --> 08:34:30,409
Takes the time by 10 seconds over Raptis.

5352
08:34:36,033 --> 08:34:38,275
Yeah, you talk about the power of cycling reps.

5353
08:34:39,161 --> 08:34:40,442
Folks, this is a great reminder.

5354
08:34:41,483 --> 08:34:47,066
Efficiency on how you do something really matters, as that was the separator between her and Haley Adams and Danielle Brand.

5355
08:34:47,086 --> 08:34:51,409
And as she pulled away on those burpees, because hers were simply faster.

5356
08:34:51,429 --> 08:34:52,930
All these athletes are out there giving their all.

5357
08:34:53,431 --> 08:34:56,993
She was committed to great technique that kept her low to the ground, and it really paid off.

5358
08:34:58,314 --> 08:34:59,475
All athletes are done.

5359
08:35:00,511 --> 08:35:03,393
There is a six minute cap in event six.

5360
08:35:04,193 --> 08:35:06,555
And we have one minute left before we hit the cap.

5361
08:35:07,435 --> 08:35:11,458
Then there'll be a one minute transition before we start event number seven.

5362
08:35:13,179 --> 08:35:16,501
Was the game plan, get the points when you can get them.

5363
08:35:18,662 --> 08:35:20,123
Highlights presented by Rogue.

5364
08:35:21,534 --> 08:35:23,295
And this is where the race really began.

5365
08:35:23,976 --> 08:35:27,458
Of course, everyone came out aggressive on the skier.

5366
08:35:27,558 --> 08:35:35,364
It was Haley that led the way, ahead by a few steps on the rest of the field, quickly joined by Brooke, Danielle, and the rest of the heat.

5367
08:35:36,085 --> 08:35:42,850
Smooth on the chest-to-bar pull-ups, but it was Lucy McGonigal about two boxes in, five to six reps where she was able to garner a lead.

5368
08:35:43,350 --> 08:35:50,292
But then there was also a late push by Danielle Brandon, who was specifically very quick to the ground on the latter 12 reps or so.

5369
08:35:50,332 --> 08:35:54,293
But Lucy was able to hold her off here and finish across that finish line.

5370
08:35:58,435 --> 08:36:00,055
Lucy McGonigal takes the heat.

5371
08:36:00,075 --> 08:36:04,656
She also might have the record for the fastest unvesting we've seen from any athlete.

5372
08:36:04,776 --> 08:36:05,517
Get it off me.

5373
08:36:05,577 --> 08:36:06,137
In the field.

5374
08:36:07,330 --> 08:36:12,097
The youngest athlete in the field from Ireland sets the new time to beat in event six.

5375
08:36:12,257 --> 08:36:16,764
Can she recover and repeat for event number seven?

5376
08:36:17,694 --> 08:36:20,775
hammered down, presented by the United States Border Patrol.

5377
08:36:21,175 --> 08:36:25,257
Well, as you mentioned, she could win an award for stripping the vest the quickest.

5378
08:36:25,577 --> 08:36:28,158
And it's because all the athletes get to remove it for this next piece.

5379
08:36:28,178 --> 08:36:37,902
35 calories now on a C2 bike, 28 bar muscle-ups, which is going to be a huge deciding factor, and 24 burpee box jumpovers to finish.

5380
08:36:37,922 --> 08:36:39,103
This one has an eight-minute cap.

5381
08:36:43,519 --> 08:36:51,662
Lexus Raptus also holds the time to beat at six minutes point three nine seconds.

5382
08:36:56,403 --> 08:36:59,344
Daniel Brannan took second in that heat.

5383
08:37:00,504 --> 08:37:01,825
Good enough for second in the event.

5384
08:37:04,086 --> 08:37:07,967
One more event to go for heat number two.

5385
08:37:07,987 --> 08:37:10,247
35 cows on the C2 bike.

5386
08:37:13,637 --> 08:37:19,381
28 bar muscle-ups and 24 more burpee box jump overs.

5387
08:37:19,461 --> 08:37:20,782
The vest is gone.

5388
08:37:24,045 --> 08:37:31,950
Brooke Wells and Claudia Gluck are sitting in 11th and 12th on the leaderboard, tied with 266 points.

5389
08:37:34,890 --> 08:37:42,476
After all the ups and downs for Brooke Wells, she still has an opportunity to get inside the top 10 going into Sunday.

5390
08:37:43,037 --> 08:37:51,904
Yeah, Chase, on that last event six, she got a pretty costly no rep, finishing her chest to bars, having to get called back to actually reconcile a missed rep at the end.

5391
08:37:52,524 --> 08:37:56,047
And she was still able to finish with a really solid time in that heat.

5392
08:37:56,767 --> 08:38:00,650
And now she's got to take full advantage of another opportunity at 100 points here.

5393
08:38:03,622 --> 08:38:07,324
Raptors was off the bike at a minute and 42 seconds.

5394
08:38:07,364 --> 08:38:10,905
What's wild is that it also took her a minute and 42 seconds to do the ski.

5395
08:38:13,927 --> 08:38:14,467
Hailey Adams.

5396
08:38:14,487 --> 08:38:15,427
Was that intentional?

5397
08:38:15,487 --> 08:38:16,408
Was it luck?

5398
08:38:16,528 --> 08:38:21,390
Either way, it plays out really cool and really highly executed for Alexis.

5399
08:38:21,410 --> 08:38:30,214
Hailey Adams taking a peek over, trying to see if she can see what Daniel Brandon is biking at.

5400
08:38:32,478 --> 08:38:33,899
Has had a three-cow lead.

5401
08:38:33,919 --> 08:38:36,721
You can see the signs just in front of their bikes.

5402
08:38:38,463 --> 08:38:41,685
Five reps for Haley Adams.

5403
08:38:44,367 --> 08:38:47,110
As Lucy McGonigal is not backing off the pace.

5404
08:38:50,392 --> 08:38:51,653
McGonigal is done.

5405
08:38:52,394 --> 08:38:54,615
Seven seconds behind Raptus's pace.

5406
08:38:55,076 --> 08:38:59,539
Now we'll have to see how the bar muscle-ups look because the muscle-ups got tough for Raptus towards the end.

5407
08:38:59,639 --> 08:39:00,000
Yes, sir.

5408
08:39:01,885 --> 08:39:04,007
And they're both starting off strong, no hesitation.

5409
08:39:04,027 --> 08:39:05,568
Get ready to work.

5410
08:39:07,149 --> 08:39:09,291
Your top five times from heat number one.

5411
08:39:09,391 --> 08:39:12,693
Raptus holds the time to beat at six minutes, 0.39 seconds.

5412
08:39:13,314 --> 08:39:18,297
Lucy McGonigal, Haley Adams, first to the rig.

5413
08:39:18,317 --> 08:39:19,378
28-bar muscle-ups.

5414
08:39:20,799 --> 08:39:25,783
The time split off the rig is 4.03 for Alexis Raptus.

5415
08:39:27,064 --> 08:39:30,126
The number to get to at the top part of your screen is 63.

5416
08:39:32,134 --> 08:39:35,456
as Lucy McGonigal is 17 reps away.

5417
08:39:36,736 --> 08:39:38,337
Ripped off 11 in that opening set.

5418
08:39:44,680 --> 08:39:48,282
Haley Adams back up on the rig, Jen Muir just to her left.

5419
08:39:50,223 --> 08:39:59,167
On the right side, Abby Dolman has yet to come off the pull-up bar and she ripped off a huge set of 17 reps.

5420
08:40:01,730 --> 08:40:06,196
to start her first set of bar muscle-ups in a very quick break.

5421
08:40:07,157 --> 08:40:08,438
As she's back up on the bar.

5422
08:40:09,900 --> 08:40:11,662
Very strong in her pulling mechanics.

5423
08:40:15,988 --> 08:40:18,251
Lucy McGonigal on your right, takes another break.

5424
08:40:19,850 --> 08:40:21,611
Lucy was flirting with that failure right there.

5425
08:40:21,631 --> 08:40:23,192
She just got a no rep at the end chase.

5426
08:40:23,212 --> 08:40:24,833
She's very quick at her lockout.

5427
08:40:25,413 --> 08:40:26,114
It's two things.

5428
08:40:26,214 --> 08:40:30,256
It's a great reward when you can do it well, but it's really costly when you get a no rep like that.

5429
08:40:30,436 --> 08:40:38,421
Claudia Gluck in the all green on the left side of your screen is trying her best to hold on for the one more rep.

5430
08:40:40,082 --> 08:40:40,342
Wow.

5431
08:40:41,403 --> 08:40:43,244
And Gluck is done.

5432
08:40:43,264 --> 08:40:45,105
20 seconds ahead of Raptors' pace.

5433
08:40:48,170 --> 08:40:50,212
Gosh, I believe that was two sets there that she got that in.

5434
08:40:51,693 --> 08:41:05,205
A minute and 33 seconds split for Gluck's bar muscle-up, but Domet is close behind as she was 11 seconds faster.

5435
08:41:10,549 --> 08:41:11,510
The race is on.

5436
08:41:12,130 --> 08:41:14,873
Gluck, Abby Domet,

5437
08:41:16,472 --> 08:41:17,153
No one else.

5438
08:41:17,513 --> 08:41:18,594
One more on the box.

5439
08:41:20,676 --> 08:41:29,043
That is Sidney McElishan, but it is a two course race in the middle between Claudia Gluck and Abby Domen.

5440
08:41:29,983 --> 08:41:36,229
Sidney McElishan on the left side of your screen is about five reps behind.

5441
08:41:42,955 --> 08:41:48,059
Abby Domit, she's, Gluck is feeling her presence throughout, seeing her at the corner of her eye.

5442
08:41:48,079 --> 08:41:53,243
It's helping continually to push her pace, and also she's moving fast enough just to keep her at bay.

5443
08:41:54,644 --> 08:41:57,926
Gluck on the right, has nine reps to go.

5444
08:42:00,068 --> 08:42:03,490
Lexi kneeling on the left side of your screen.

5445
08:42:04,571 --> 08:42:05,632
Holding on to third.

5446
08:42:07,513 --> 08:42:10,756
One minute before we hit the tie to beat by Raptis.

5447
08:42:12,750 --> 08:42:16,132
All these athletes trying to avoid the temptation of doing kickstand burpees, Chase.

5448
08:42:16,152 --> 08:42:20,994
Kickstand meaning they want to put their hands down, pause for a second like it's a kickstand, then drop.

5449
08:42:21,214 --> 08:42:22,475
You want to lead with your chest.

5450
08:42:22,495 --> 08:42:26,757
You can reduce a tremendous amount of time, and it really adds up when you're doing a ton of burpees like this.

5451
08:42:26,977 --> 08:42:29,859
Last rep for Gluck, and she's in.

5452
08:42:32,320 --> 08:42:37,423
Abby Doman, also under the six-minute mark.

5453
08:42:40,757 --> 08:42:43,239
Left side in lane one, Lexi Neely.

5454
08:42:44,040 --> 08:42:50,365
Right side, McGonigal has moved ahead of Neely and has about a half-rep lead on her.

5455
08:42:53,367 --> 08:42:54,628
One more for McGonigal.

5456
08:42:57,751 --> 08:43:01,794
She's in right underneath the six-minute mark, along with Neely.

5457
08:43:08,980 --> 08:43:10,161
Daniel Brandon is done.

5458
08:43:11,405 --> 08:43:14,347
Two minutes before we have the eight minute cap.

5459
08:43:16,768 --> 08:43:17,448
Fees in.

5460
08:43:27,653 --> 08:43:36,058
Nicolichan stuck in just ahead of Haley Adams as Jen Muir is done with her last burpee box jump over.

5461
08:43:39,633 --> 08:43:44,176
Muir seemed to navigate that blister on her hand pretty well to be finishing this fast, to be honest.

5462
08:43:44,256 --> 08:43:47,378
I didn't know what to expect, and we got that report about battling that.

5463
08:43:47,418 --> 08:43:53,721
When you're battling skin care on your hands and you've got to do all those hanging reps, that's a huge obstacle to face.

5464
08:43:56,923 --> 08:43:58,965
Last athlete on the floor is Brooke Wells.

5465
08:43:59,005 --> 08:44:02,206
She has a minute to get these last nine reps.

5466
08:44:06,003 --> 08:44:09,387
Two solid back-to-back finishes for Lucy McGonigal, however.

5467
08:44:09,407 --> 08:44:16,615
We're less than a minute remaining, as well as has six minutes, six reps left to go.

5468
08:44:26,776 --> 08:44:32,818
It's one of those moments where Brooke knowing this is gonna be one of her last opportunities on the competition floor, trying to soak it up a little bit.

5469
08:44:33,958 --> 08:44:35,959
Never a position a competitor wants to be in.

5470
08:44:39,360 --> 08:44:41,701
Got a Scott Panchik siding in the crowd.

5471
08:44:48,603 --> 08:44:49,744
And Brooke Walls is in.

5472
08:44:51,108 --> 08:45:01,373
just under that eight minute cap as Claudia Gluck has set the time to beat in event seven for heat number two.

5473
08:45:01,393 --> 08:45:04,715
If you check out our highlights by Rogue Fitness.

5474
08:45:06,050 --> 08:45:09,872
This is a lot of up and down and all around, just like much of this weekend has been.

5475
08:45:10,673 --> 08:45:11,834
We saw different leaders.

5476
08:45:11,874 --> 08:45:19,058
McGonigal was one of the first ones off, followed by Adams, but they were not the ones to leave the heat coming off the bar muscle-ups.

5477
08:45:19,118 --> 08:45:29,585
It was Claudia Gluck who seemed to work through all 28 bar muscle-ups in simply two sets to get herself a huge advantage and dictate the pace here on the Burpee Box Jump Overs.

5478
08:45:30,006 --> 08:45:30,386
And again,

5479
08:45:30,866 --> 08:45:34,388
This is where that will and sheer fortitude is able to be highlighted.

5480
08:45:34,468 --> 08:45:41,492
And she did it and had it in droves, willing her way to, at least for right now, a time to beat in event number seven.

5481
08:45:43,473 --> 08:45:48,096
We talked about how important that was for Claudia Gluck to have two back-to-back good finishes.

5482
08:45:48,136 --> 08:45:53,819
She's got fifth in event six after two heats, first in event seven.

5483
08:45:53,879 --> 08:45:58,422
And she is six points out of a top 10 position going into Sunday.

5484
08:45:59,814 --> 08:46:01,077
That'll do it for Heat 2.

5485
08:46:01,718 --> 08:46:05,066
Final action for individual women coming up next.

5486
08:47:05,254 --> 08:47:15,223
Saturday night at the 2025 CrossFit Games is about to come to a close, but hold the fireworks because we have one more heat remaining.

5487
08:47:16,024 --> 08:47:16,845
I'm Chase Ingram.

5488
08:47:16,925 --> 08:47:18,487
Along with me is Adrian Conway.

5489
08:47:19,127 --> 08:47:21,910
Mike Arsenault will be joining us on the floor shortly.

5490
08:47:22,971 --> 08:47:29,137
It's been a long day as we just finished event five, and that was that heavy one rep max back squat.

5491
08:47:30,315 --> 08:47:30,696
That's right.

5492
08:47:30,736 --> 08:47:34,522
We had some shaking up and heavy lifting to do earlier today.

5493
08:47:34,562 --> 08:47:36,025
And Maddie Sturt put on a show.

5494
08:47:36,826 --> 08:47:39,090
Able to climb the leaderboard with her consistency.

5495
08:47:39,130 --> 08:47:43,136
She really put on a clinic on how to show up and execute three quality lifts.

5496
08:47:44,842 --> 08:47:47,724
And then it was the champ doing champ things.

5497
08:47:48,265 --> 08:47:59,874
She took it personal when she wasn't wearing the red and the white chase, and she handled business, executing a squat that, from what we know, is the best that we've seen since 2020 on the competition floor of 335 pounds.

5498
08:48:00,614 --> 08:48:05,018
And it was a flawless lift, especially for an athlete that's been saying, hey, I've been focusing on my endurance last year.

5499
08:48:06,042 --> 08:48:12,968
Your standings after five events, and she's back on top by 65 points.

5500
08:48:13,849 --> 08:48:25,159
Lucy Campbell still holding on to second, but Maddie Sturt has moved herself in to podium contention, holding on third.

5501
08:48:26,000 --> 08:48:30,885
It's an individual event, six and seven, presented by the United States Border Patrol.

5502
08:48:32,142 --> 08:48:37,867
Throttle up and hammer down, and if we think that we've seen some shaking up, Chase, we got something to come.

5503
08:48:37,967 --> 08:48:45,112
It's 35 calories on the skier, 28 chest-to-bar pull-ups, 24 burpee box jump-overs, all while wearing a 16-pound weight vest.

5504
08:48:45,493 --> 08:48:51,758
They get a one-minute hard reset into 35 calories on a bike, 28 bar muscle-ups, and 24 burpee box jump-overs.

5505
08:48:52,258 --> 08:48:54,400
And for that, the weight is removed.

5506
08:48:54,460 --> 08:48:55,801
It's time to see your body weight skills.

5507
08:48:57,379 --> 08:49:00,400
Adrian, what is your tempo recipe for success?

5508
08:49:00,620 --> 08:49:02,281
It's pretty simple, and I think it holds true.

5509
08:49:02,381 --> 08:49:04,061
For event number six, it's got to be full send.

5510
08:49:04,081 --> 08:49:05,862
There's no time to pace and no time to wait.

5511
08:49:06,422 --> 08:49:09,103
And on number seven, you've got to pace and break.

5512
08:49:09,503 --> 08:49:12,364
We're going to need to be strategic with how we attack these 28-bar muscle-ups.

5513
08:49:13,784 --> 08:49:16,305
Your lane assignments for the third and final heat.

5514
08:49:17,330 --> 08:49:18,851
for women's event number six.

5515
08:49:19,311 --> 08:49:24,834
In lane number five, back in the red and white leader jersey.

5516
08:49:24,914 --> 08:49:26,175
Let's go down to Mike Arsenault.

5517
08:49:26,615 --> 08:49:31,098
Well, we mentioned it yesterday that Tia has had an endurance focus in her training so far in 2025.

5518
08:49:31,958 --> 08:49:38,702
However, still 335 pounds good for fourth in event number five, turning that deficit into a 65-point lead.

5519
08:49:39,182 --> 08:49:41,964
200 points up for grabs, though, in event six and event seven.

5520
08:49:42,004 --> 08:49:43,805
So that lead is far from safe.

5521
08:49:43,845 --> 08:49:45,265
We'll see if some of these ladies can

5522
08:49:46,266 --> 08:49:48,367
bite into that lead over the next two events.

5523
08:49:49,968 --> 08:49:52,669
Your vision fuels victory athletes to watch.

5524
08:49:52,829 --> 08:49:55,570
Obviously, we saw Tia go from minus 2 to plus 65.

5525
08:49:56,491 --> 08:49:59,472
But she is not alone on the podium with Maddie Sturt sitting there in third.

5526
08:49:59,492 --> 08:50:08,056
35 cows on the skier, starting things off.

5527
08:50:08,076 --> 08:50:10,017
16-pound vest.

5528
08:50:13,399 --> 08:50:15,080
Now, two athletes keeping pace.

5529
08:50:16,602 --> 08:50:18,284
All from the same place.

5530
08:50:19,285 --> 08:50:22,007
Maddie Sturt on the left, currently sitting in third overall.

5531
08:50:23,328 --> 08:50:26,011
Gracie Walton on the right, she's holding on to 10th.

5532
08:50:26,071 --> 08:50:33,618
However, if we're talking about burpees over a box, there's no one better in the space than Gracie Walton.

5533
08:50:34,339 --> 08:50:41,906
If you don't have a memory back to what she did in 2024 in a workout called Firestorm, which is all that, and then some,

5534
08:50:42,926 --> 08:50:47,850
You better remind yourself because she's going to be coming when it comes to getting over these burpees in a sprint-style workout.

5535
08:50:47,870 --> 08:50:48,831
So you named it, Chasen.

5536
08:50:48,851 --> 08:50:49,171
You're right.

5537
08:50:49,191 --> 08:50:50,392
You got to keep your eyes out on her.

5538
08:50:50,672 --> 08:50:52,754
But then Maddie Stirk coming up with all this momentum.

5539
08:50:52,794 --> 08:51:01,782
We know that she spends so much time with Tia Claire Toomey, has adopted that mindset of a champion, and she's really showing that she's executing at that type of level.

5540
08:51:01,802 --> 08:51:02,782
35 cows on the skier.

5541
08:51:07,388 --> 08:51:10,669
The time split here by Lucy McGonigal's 144.

5542
08:51:11,410 --> 08:51:12,410
She has the time to beat.

5543
08:51:12,930 --> 08:51:22,294
Lucy Campbell on the right side of your screen may not be wearing the leader jersey anymore after the backswap, however, still sitting solidly in second place.

5544
08:51:23,200 --> 08:51:27,343
Again, these women all rep for rep or calorie for calorie right now on the skier.

5545
08:51:27,803 --> 08:51:31,546
Different strategies, Lucy showing a little bit of a slower cycle rate with more power.

5546
08:51:31,967 --> 08:51:36,130
Tia more often with the strokes, a little bit higher turnover there.

5547
08:51:36,670 --> 08:51:41,734
And again, it's calorie for calorie with Tia with a slight edge over Lucy right now, but they are not first off the skier.

5548
08:51:42,234 --> 08:51:43,635
It looks like it is Amy Kringle.

5549
08:51:45,337 --> 08:51:46,958
Kringle in the all pink on the left.

5550
08:51:49,415 --> 08:51:52,057
The time to beat, 355.56.

5551
08:51:52,097 --> 08:51:54,258
That was set by Lucy McGonigal in the second heat.

5552
08:51:55,659 --> 08:52:00,902
She was off the pull up bar at two minutes and 14 seconds.

5553
08:52:05,605 --> 08:52:05,826
U.S.

5554
08:52:05,886 --> 08:52:07,126
Border Patrol is hiring.

5555
08:52:07,507 --> 08:52:09,408
Make an impact and be an agent of strength.

Apply now at CBP.gov forward slash CrossFit.

5557
08:52:14,151 --> 08:52:15,512
Kringle is done and onto the box.

5558
08:52:22,263 --> 08:52:23,523
Looks like Lydia Fish.

5559
08:52:29,146 --> 08:52:33,327
That is Olivia Kerstetter, right next to her in the black.

5560
08:52:35,168 --> 08:52:37,549
Tia Toomey, Lucy Campbell in the center two lanes.

5561
08:52:37,729 --> 08:52:38,889
Toomey in the white and red.

5562
08:52:39,850 --> 08:52:41,330
Campbell in the all light green.

5563
08:52:42,451 --> 08:52:44,331
Ariel Lohan right there with them all.

5564
08:52:44,352 --> 08:52:47,933
This is gonna be a tight one, Chase.

5565
08:52:49,818 --> 08:52:52,899
At the fourth box, McGonigal was done at 3.03.

5566
08:52:53,099 --> 08:52:56,520
They're advancing to the fourth box now.

5567
08:52:57,321 --> 08:53:01,702
All five athletes about a rep apart.

5568
08:53:04,943 --> 08:53:09,585
And as Ariel Lohan, on pace of Lucy McGonigal.

5569
08:53:12,553 --> 08:53:19,621
Can Amy Kringle, Olivia Kerstetter, Tia or Lucy Campbell get underneath it?

5570
08:53:19,841 --> 08:53:26,308
Ariel Lohan still holding a slight edge on the far right side of your screen.

5571
08:53:27,249 --> 08:53:28,590
Here comes Tia and Lucy.

5572
08:53:30,793 --> 08:53:33,996
Ariel's to the box first, six reps left to go.

5573
08:53:35,398 --> 08:53:38,821
She's trying to hold off four other athletes and the time to beat.

5574
08:53:38,962 --> 08:53:40,924
Lucy just got hit with a huge no rep.

5575
08:53:40,964 --> 08:53:42,625
She jumped off the box on her second rep.

5576
08:53:42,645 --> 08:53:45,208
You got to step down, so she's going to drop behind.

5577
08:53:46,389 --> 08:53:58,121
Ariel Lohan, sitting in eighth, is going to get herself 100 points in event number six, followed by Tia Toomey.

5578
08:54:01,112 --> 08:54:05,535
Leweski is done underneath the four minute mark followed by Kersetter.

5579
08:54:06,976 --> 08:54:07,636
Pringles in.

5580
08:54:12,279 --> 08:54:17,683
Ariel Lohan did not hold back on those last burpees.

5581
08:54:18,884 --> 08:54:27,810
Able to take the heat and take the win as Lydia Fish is finishing up her last burpee box jump over.

5582
08:54:30,820 --> 08:54:37,642
Tia takes third overall, as McGonigal's time is good enough for second.

5583
08:54:39,543 --> 08:54:40,563
Campbell takes fifth.

5584
08:54:43,564 --> 08:54:44,265
Walton's in.

5585
08:54:47,806 --> 08:54:56,529
Last in this heat, actually 24th in the event for event number six, as we have about one minute remaining on the time cap.

5586
08:54:59,075 --> 08:55:04,960
And another minute reset before we hit our final event of the afternoon.

5587
08:55:07,863 --> 08:55:09,144
The champ doing champ things.

5588
08:55:09,544 --> 08:55:10,965
She knows where she's sitting on the leaderboard.

5589
08:55:11,005 --> 08:55:13,448
She's handling her business, focusing on recovery.

5590
08:55:13,468 --> 08:55:15,810
If we get a shot there of young Willow.

5591
08:55:29,204 --> 08:55:37,429
Lydia Fish 20th in event six after getting ninth in the heat.

5592
08:55:41,812 --> 08:55:43,073
There's the school of fish.

5593
08:55:43,813 --> 08:55:45,254
They're supporting their girl Lydia.

5594
08:55:55,540 --> 08:55:58,182
Great execution there on loan on the latter half of that workout.

5595
08:56:01,273 --> 08:56:02,914
She did exactly what she needed to do.

5596
08:56:02,994 --> 08:56:05,096
And here is an example of our highlights.

5597
08:56:05,116 --> 08:56:08,779
We thought it was going to be the lead coming off the skier that was going to set the precedent.

5598
08:56:08,799 --> 08:56:10,361
But it was Amy Kringle who got off to that.

5599
08:56:10,741 --> 08:56:15,345
First into the chest of our pull-ups by a couple reps, closely followed by Olivia Kerstetter.

5600
08:56:15,365 --> 08:56:18,347
It looked like we had a race really brewing between the two of them.

5601
08:56:18,367 --> 08:56:20,389
And then they were joined by the rest of the field.

5602
08:56:20,969 --> 08:56:26,214
But it was Ariel Lohan who was a bit displaced from that middle pack that was making a charge to the front.

5603
08:56:27,257 --> 08:56:28,578
We had a little back and forth.

5604
08:56:28,598 --> 08:56:32,541
Lucy got hit with a costly no rep there, jumping down from her box top rep too.

5605
08:56:32,561 --> 08:56:38,506
These athletes had to step down all those boxed burpee getovers until the third rep of each transition.

5606
08:56:38,887 --> 08:56:43,911
But it was Mrs. Ariel Lohan that came across first and then Tia Claire Toomey with a close second.

5607
08:56:50,997 --> 08:56:51,758
Your results.

5608
08:56:53,278 --> 08:56:57,540
For event number six, Ariel Owen will take the event at 352.

5609
08:56:57,620 --> 08:56:59,902
McGonigal at 355.

5610
08:56:59,942 --> 08:57:04,164
And Tia Claire Toomey rounding out your top three at 356.

5611
08:57:05,905 --> 08:57:09,387
And event seven, heat number three underway.

5612
08:57:09,987 --> 08:57:18,312
Final opportunities to get points here on Saturday night.

5613
08:57:18,612 --> 08:57:20,353
35 cows on the Concept 2 bike.

5614
08:57:22,184 --> 08:57:26,527
28 bar muscle-ups and 24 burpees over the box.

5615
08:57:26,747 --> 08:57:30,049
The weight vest is gone and the intensity is up.

5616
08:57:30,469 --> 08:57:32,330
Yeah, the intensity is up.

5617
08:57:34,171 --> 08:57:38,773
Lucy Campbell absolutely blistering these concept two calories right now.

5618
08:57:44,697 --> 08:57:46,898
Lucy Campbell sitting in second overall.

5619
08:57:51,045 --> 08:57:53,027
She has 357 points.

5620
08:57:56,209 --> 08:58:00,332
Gave a few points back to Ariel Lowen, who's in eighth.

5621
08:58:02,654 --> 08:58:07,617
McGonigal is absolutely spinning those pedals.

5622
08:58:09,719 --> 08:58:10,039
Campbell.

5623
08:58:13,654 --> 08:58:14,455
Did I say McGonigal?

5624
08:58:14,475 --> 08:58:14,775
You did.

5625
08:58:15,035 --> 08:58:16,957
Ah, I thought I was going to have a clean run this weekend.

5626
08:58:17,077 --> 08:58:17,597
Hey, listen.

5627
08:58:17,978 --> 08:58:21,901
And what I want to point out is that Lucer's one of the first athletes to reach the seated position.

5628
08:58:21,921 --> 08:58:22,982
A lot of people stand up.

5629
08:58:23,002 --> 08:58:24,063
They're trying to gain momentum.

5630
08:58:24,123 --> 08:58:28,106
That should be a very short-lived period in order to get up the wattage and the momentum.

5631
08:58:28,386 --> 08:58:34,412
Get to that high seated position so that you can become weightless and use your legs to lean forward over the pedals and really keep them turning.

5632
08:58:36,173 --> 08:58:37,294
Off the bike first.

5633
08:58:37,854 --> 08:58:40,557
Saw the same thing for the skier as Amy Kringle.

5634
08:58:42,561 --> 08:58:50,205
The time to beat set by Claudia Gluck in heat number two is 527.14.

5635
08:58:51,005 --> 08:58:52,986
She was off the bike at 205.

5636
08:58:55,648 --> 08:59:04,192
That said, she absolutely demolished those 28-bar muscle-ups, and that might have been according to plan as far as how she paced out the bike.

5637
08:59:08,957 --> 08:59:10,678
Right now, all these women looking really strong.

5638
08:59:10,718 --> 08:59:19,441
We saw from the last heat, it's not a matter of if you break, it's when you break and how long you get on the ground and stay on the ground that dictates the outcome of this one.

5639
08:59:19,681 --> 08:59:20,761
You've got to get back up to the rig.

5640
08:59:20,881 --> 08:59:28,124
Your top five times in the bottom left corner of your screen, Claudia Gluck, Abby Domet, Lucy McGonigal, and Lexi Neely.

5641
08:59:28,624 --> 08:59:31,185
Three 100s of a second between third and fourth.

5642
08:59:34,506 --> 08:59:36,567
The number to get to in the top part of your screen

5643
08:59:37,535 --> 08:59:38,596
is 63.

5644
08:59:39,797 --> 08:59:44,301
Amy Kringle has 10 reps left to go.

5645
08:59:46,203 --> 08:59:49,606
The time off the rig by Claudia Gluck was 3.39.

5646
08:59:52,788 --> 08:59:57,012
Lucy Cam on the far right side of your screen currently has eight reps left to go.

5647
08:59:59,434 --> 09:00:02,677
As Toomey and Kringle just past her.

5648
09:00:04,633 --> 09:00:07,274
Lucy on the right side of your screen, back up to the bar.

5649
09:00:07,314 --> 09:00:10,555
Can she hang on for the rest of this set?

5650
09:00:10,855 --> 09:00:14,236
Yep, this is where Campbell has an opportunity to make her move right now.

5651
09:00:16,117 --> 09:00:17,718
Five reps left to go for Campbell.

5652
09:00:21,739 --> 09:00:24,760
Left side of your screen, Kringle, behind by two.

5653
09:00:25,380 --> 09:00:27,161
Toomey, two reps back as well.

5654
09:00:29,281 --> 09:00:29,742
That was it.

5655
09:00:29,882 --> 09:00:30,402
Here we go.

5656
09:00:31,642 --> 09:00:32,983
And the race is on the box.

5657
09:00:35,528 --> 09:00:39,649
Lucy Campbell is seven seconds ahead of the pace set by Gluck.

5658
09:00:39,729 --> 09:00:41,309
And we know how fast Gluck went.

5659
09:00:42,429 --> 09:00:47,731
And we know how fast you need to go because the seven time CrossFit Games champion is trying to run you down.

5660
09:00:50,511 --> 09:00:55,992
Maybe a little retribution this morning for Tia Claire Toomey after what happened in event number four.

5661
09:01:02,114 --> 09:01:03,254
Past the four minute mark.

5662
09:01:05,172 --> 09:01:13,180
Claudia Gluck was at 434 after the fourth box, and that is where Lucy Campbell is at the moment.

5663
09:01:14,622 --> 09:01:22,170
And she is opening up the lead, not just on Claudia Gluck, but on Tia Claire Toomey as well.

5664
09:01:22,870 --> 09:01:24,692
And Tia knows exactly where she needs to be.

5665
09:01:24,752 --> 09:01:25,293
She's looking.

5666
09:01:26,747 --> 09:01:32,171
at exactly where Lucy's settling with her pace on these burpee box jumpovers, and Tia knows she's just gotta keep her close.

5667
09:01:32,571 --> 09:01:41,077
With the point spread that she's got right now in first place, it's all about staying as close as she needs to, so there's very little to no gap between her and Lucy Campbell, and she'll be just fine.

5668
09:01:44,599 --> 09:01:54,306
Tia came in with a 65-point lead on Lucy Campbell, and Lucy Campbell almost popped off the box again.

5669
09:01:55,813 --> 09:01:58,214
And that's what cost her in that first event, number six.

5670
09:01:58,614 --> 09:02:00,135
Three more reps for Campbell.

5671
09:02:01,736 --> 09:02:03,597
The time to beat is 5.27.

5672
09:02:03,637 --> 09:02:04,797
That's not going to stand.

5673
09:02:05,418 --> 09:02:10,460
And Lucy Campbell is going to get her second event win of the day.

5674
09:02:17,043 --> 09:02:18,644
Tia Toomey's final three reps.

5675
09:02:23,683 --> 09:02:29,508
It's a time to beat his 527 coming into this and she will sneak right underneath that.

5676
09:02:31,830 --> 09:02:34,492
There's Amy Kringle's on her last two burpee box jump overs.

5677
09:02:34,952 --> 09:02:37,635
Ariel Lohan on the right side of your screen on her final two as well.

5678
09:02:37,755 --> 09:02:39,476
Wow, gonna be a great showing for Ariel.

5679
09:02:41,918 --> 09:02:44,581
Great back to back vents for Ariel Lohan.

5680
09:02:46,722 --> 09:02:48,344
Erin Von Rohr clears the box.

5681
09:02:56,927 --> 09:02:57,928
Maddie Sturt is in.

5682
09:03:04,533 --> 09:03:05,313
Annika Greer.

5683
09:03:09,977 --> 09:03:11,318
She'll get across the finish line.

5684
09:03:16,293 --> 09:03:20,917
Something very unique about this back-to-back stimulus chase as we see Lydia Fish come across the finish line.

5685
09:03:21,538 --> 09:03:27,103
Every athlete just completely loses body control and submits to gravity with no choice.

5686
09:03:27,123 --> 09:03:28,384
They're not doing that on purpose, folks.

5687
09:03:28,404 --> 09:03:29,085
This ain't no show.

5688
09:03:30,186 --> 09:03:40,635
First setter is in, and what we thought was going to be a great opportunity for Gracie Walton to make a move up the leaderboard turned out to be anything but that with two very tough finishes.

5689
09:03:41,812 --> 09:03:46,255
And on the opposite side of the spectrum, you've got Lucy Campbell.

5690
09:03:47,295 --> 09:03:55,180
And outside of an athlete named Tia Claire Toomey, that might be one of the best single day performances we've seen from any athlete at the CrossFit Games.

5691
09:03:56,121 --> 09:03:56,641
Absolutely.

5692
09:03:56,681 --> 09:03:58,702
Lucy Campbell put on an absolute show.

5693
09:03:58,903 --> 09:04:03,185
And if the world didn't recognize her fitness, they're recognizing it now.

5694
09:04:04,646 --> 09:04:05,487
Lucy Campbell.

5695
09:04:06,463 --> 09:04:09,925
Got fifth in event six and first in event seven.

5696
09:04:10,145 --> 09:04:12,106
Your highlights presented by Rogue Fitness.

5697
09:04:12,747 --> 09:04:17,989
Well, if it was a race off the erg, Amy Kringle would have won both of them, but it didn't stop there.

5698
09:04:18,330 --> 09:04:19,270
It simply started there.

5699
09:04:19,310 --> 09:04:23,713
She had the urgency needed to put herself in a good position to have some solid finishes.

5700
09:04:25,056 --> 09:04:29,397
But it was Lucy Campbell who paced it appropriately, specifically at the bar muscle-ups.

5701
09:04:29,417 --> 09:04:33,197
We talked about break, don't wait being one of the keys to success.

5702
09:04:33,497 --> 09:04:35,018
And she followed it through all the way.

5703
09:04:35,038 --> 09:04:36,838
Now, she had a costly no rep in event six.

5704
09:04:37,138 --> 09:04:38,038
She learned the hard way.

5705
09:04:38,298 --> 09:04:41,119
She stepped down all the appropriate reps here, leading all the way through.

5706
09:04:41,359 --> 09:04:51,320
Jumped down the ones that she could, kept her urgency, and it put her on her way to a second event win here on Saturday in the MVP arena at the 2025 CrossFit Games.

5707
09:04:51,340 --> 09:04:53,521
Lucy Campbell is putting the world on notice.

5708
09:04:53,621 --> 09:04:54,421
I'm back.

5709
09:05:01,050 --> 09:05:07,892
Year results for individual event number 7, Lucy Campbell gets her second event win for the day.

5710
09:05:07,912 --> 09:05:14,255
That was her and Ariel Lohan who took event 6 and 7.

5711
09:05:15,475 --> 09:05:20,777
Both seeing green with Mike Arsenault with our two event winners.

5712
09:05:21,853 --> 09:05:26,914
Aira, your second career event win in your CrossFit Games career.

5713
09:05:27,254 --> 09:05:33,335
Very impressive, your fifth appearance at the Games in Event 6, and then you followed up in Event 7 with a really strong performance as well.

5714
09:05:33,395 --> 09:05:37,396
How were you able to manage your rest to come back with a strong performance in Event 7?

5715
09:05:38,176 --> 09:05:47,158
I train a lot with a lot of fun people in my home gym, but I really do think a burpee box jump over is like the most truest test of fitness.

5716
09:05:47,958 --> 09:05:51,119
So I'm really proud that I have good fitness and I can show up on this event.

5717
09:05:51,642 --> 09:05:58,528
Well, speaking of training, as a parent, I like to use my kids and excuses as an excuse of why I can't train as much as I should.

5718
09:05:58,568 --> 09:06:03,192
And you put a big hole into that argument that you're a professional athlete appearing at the CrossFit Games.

5719
09:06:03,452 --> 09:06:09,097
How do you manage your time effectively that you can train like this and put results on the floor like you have?

5720
09:06:09,417 --> 09:06:09,817
Thank you.

5721
09:06:09,998 --> 09:06:11,579
I think number one is just mindset.

5722
09:06:11,599 --> 09:06:15,282
There'll always be an excuse of why you can't do it, why you shouldn't do it.

5723
09:06:16,023 --> 09:06:19,045
But if you set boundaries and prioritize your time, absolutely.

5724
09:06:19,666 --> 09:06:24,490
I'm not saying you should be training three hours a day like me, but a 30-minute walk is just as good.

5725
09:06:25,050 --> 09:06:25,511
Sounds good.

5726
09:06:25,551 --> 09:06:26,211
Congratulations.

5727
09:06:26,251 --> 09:06:26,772
We'll see you tomorrow.

5728
09:06:26,912 --> 09:06:27,312
Thank you.

5729
09:06:27,472 --> 09:06:27,773
Thank you.

5730
09:06:30,123 --> 09:06:31,585
Now, good things come in twos.

5731
09:06:31,625 --> 09:06:36,089
Apparently, Lucy, this is your second win of the 2025 CrossFit Games.

5732
09:06:36,169 --> 09:06:38,692
Terrific performance in event number seven.

5733
09:06:38,732 --> 09:06:43,617
Looks like you're definitely going to keep yourself on the podium, potentially closing that gap with Tia.

5734
09:06:43,857 --> 09:06:45,619
How would you evaluate your performance today?

5735
09:06:47,842 --> 09:06:49,843
I know that I've just won an event, but mixed.

5736
09:06:50,123 --> 09:06:53,024
Like, event six, I made a stupid mistake.

5737
09:06:53,104 --> 09:06:59,126
I got carried up in the heat of the moment racing tier, and I think I got a little bit too excited and jumped off the box.

5738
09:06:59,166 --> 09:07:05,408
But I think that comes with practice, and I still feel pretty new back into it.

5739
09:07:05,508 --> 09:07:11,490
So it's those little things that I know that I can improve, and then I really just had to refocus.

5740
09:07:12,630 --> 09:07:16,574
every single box jump over, I was like, step, step, jump, step, step, jump.

5741
09:07:16,654 --> 09:07:17,935
I didn't even know what box I was on.

5742
09:07:17,955 --> 09:07:19,557
I was just making sure that I didn't mess it up again.

5743
09:07:20,258 --> 09:07:24,261
When we talked earlier today, we talked about your injury and some of the limitations that you have.

5744
09:07:24,522 --> 09:07:32,650
Is there an aspect of your fitness that has actually improved since dealing with that injury that maybe took more of a focus when you had to alleviate concerns with your wrist?

5745
09:07:34,493 --> 09:07:36,394
Yes, but ironically not in this event.

5746
09:07:36,534 --> 09:07:49,483
I think if anything, we saw that more with the deadlifts and I know that the squat wasn't my best finish objectively, but it's something that I've been working a hell of a lot on and it really has come on a lot.

5747
09:07:50,083 --> 09:07:58,289
So it's those things that are just filling in the gaps and it's still a work in progress coming back into it, but you know, showing the results overall.

5748
09:07:58,795 --> 09:08:04,122
Well, that work in progress is on the podium heading into the final day of competition at the 2025 CrossFit Games.

5749
09:08:04,163 --> 09:08:04,703
Congratulations.

5750
09:08:05,004 --> 09:08:05,384
Thank you.

5751
09:08:05,404 --> 09:08:06,886
Hey.

5752
09:08:07,973 --> 09:08:09,935
What a day from Lucy Campbell.

5753
09:08:10,115 --> 09:08:11,776
I mean, and what a great attitude.

5754
09:08:11,816 --> 09:08:16,500
Look, she just won an event chase, and she's so hyper-focused on getting better and executing to her potential.

5755
09:08:16,961 --> 09:08:18,682
She's like, I'm a little disappointed with that missed cue.

5756
09:08:18,722 --> 09:08:20,163
I got excited competing against Tia.

5757
09:08:20,323 --> 09:08:21,865
And folks, take a listen from Lucy.

5758
09:08:22,345 --> 09:08:23,526
Get hyper-focused on a cue.

5759
09:08:23,566 --> 09:08:26,889
She said, all I knew was step, step, jump, step, step, jump.

5760
09:08:26,909 --> 09:08:28,330
I didn't even know what rep I was on.

5761
09:08:28,530 --> 09:08:30,111
And that's called self-cueing at its finest.

5762
09:08:30,131 --> 09:08:35,656
Well, Lucy Campbell had a heck of a day, but she did not have the moment of the day.

5763
09:08:38,029 --> 09:08:45,275
And that moment, our Sotva sleeper moment of the day, goes to another Australian.

5764
09:08:45,955 --> 09:08:58,245
Jake Crouch's performance in individual event number four, not only got him his first event win at the CrossFit Games, but allowed him to wear that jersey for the first time.

5765
09:09:01,317 --> 09:09:02,478
What do we like from Jay today?

5766
09:09:02,899 --> 09:09:05,441
Hey, we might have been sleeping on him to start the day.

5767
09:09:05,501 --> 09:09:06,943
We are sleeping no more.

5768
09:09:07,163 --> 09:09:09,285
He came and kicked down the walls with his event win.

5769
09:09:09,625 --> 09:09:11,768
And it's been an honor to watch what Jay's been able to do.

5770
09:09:11,828 --> 09:09:17,393
And he is far from done when it comes to the tests that are still looming in the course of this weekend.

5771
09:09:17,413 --> 09:09:18,775
So we're going to see a lot of Mr. Crouch.

5772
09:09:19,140 --> 09:09:21,661
Boy, oh, boy.

5773
09:09:22,062 --> 09:09:23,923
Check out that leaderboard.

5774
09:09:23,983 --> 09:09:26,904
These are your standings going into Sunday.

5775
09:09:27,584 --> 09:09:29,726
Jason Hopper still holding the leaderboard.

5776
09:09:30,026 --> 09:09:37,049
Ricky Garrard has launched himself all the way into second, and James Sprague now sitting in third.

5777
09:09:37,610 --> 09:09:41,572
Look, man, we got 41 points to separate first to seventh place.

5778
09:09:43,048 --> 09:09:44,069
Get your popcorn ready.

5779
09:09:45,010 --> 09:09:45,991
It's going to be a close one.

5780
09:09:46,211 --> 09:09:48,913
And we have three more events on Sunday.

5781
09:09:49,534 --> 09:09:50,875
But that is not all.

5782
09:09:50,915 --> 09:09:53,658
Your standings after seven events for the women.

5783
09:09:54,539 --> 09:09:59,123
Tia Claire Toomey sits on top of the leaderboard with 610.

5784
09:10:00,044 --> 09:10:00,924
Lucy Campbell, 541.

5785
09:10:02,466 --> 09:10:07,771
And Ariel Lohan has now launched herself back on top of the podium.

5786
09:10:10,925 --> 09:10:15,147
400 points were today, we have 300 points coming up tomorrow.

5787
09:10:15,367 --> 09:10:21,069
And on Sunday, team events will kick things off.

5788
09:10:22,369 --> 09:10:23,890
Individuals have three of them.

5789
09:10:24,130 --> 09:10:33,053
We still don't know what the final event is going to be, but we know we have a race on our hands for the men and the women.

5790
09:10:38,362 --> 09:10:46,224
The Wild Saturday has come to a close, and we were treated to a spectacle all day long.

5791
09:10:46,304 --> 09:10:47,645
We say you had to be here.

5792
09:10:48,145 --> 09:10:49,065
You had to be here.

5793
09:10:49,145 --> 09:10:52,126
Good news, we got one more day of competition left.

5794
09:10:52,626 --> 09:10:56,447
For Agent Conway, Mike Arsenault, I'm Chase Ingram.

5795
09:10:56,847 --> 09:11:04,249
We say goodnight to Saturday, and we'll see you crowning champions tomorrow here in MVP Arena at the 2025 CrossFit Games.

5796
09:11:23,022 --> 09:11:23,202
you
