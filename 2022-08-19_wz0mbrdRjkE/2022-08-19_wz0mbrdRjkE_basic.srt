Hello, I'm Shannon Demos. I am the proud principal of the Brooks Elementary School. Here at the Brooks, we serve approximately 520 students in grades pre-K to 5 and have 88 highly dedicated staff members working daily with our diverse learning population.

00:00:16,288 --> 00:00:38,148
Along with our general education classrooms, we are proud to house three MEEP preschool classrooms, one developmental classroom, and four language-based classrooms. Brooks Elementary School is specialist in physical education, music, art, nexus, and technology. While we do not qualify for Title I, we do have remedial reading teachers and one EL teacher for students in grades K-5.

00:00:38,148 --> 00:00:53,148
We are committed to nurturing collaboration, imagination, and creative problem solving at the Brooks. As a responsive classroom model school, we strive to establish and maintain an environment that supports the whole child, challenges prejudice, respects differences, and fosters a deep concern for others.

00:00:53,148 --> 00:01:17,346
The Brooks educators, staff, volunteers, parents, guardians, and students work together to provide all students and staff with a safe place to learn while allowing them to be curious and take intellectual risks to achieve high academic standards and to grow to their full potential. Every member of the Brooks community pledges to be kind, be safe, and be responsible. These Brooks Bees encompass all that we prioritize in our daily interactions with each other.

00:01:17,910 --> 00:01:44,735
As I previously mentioned, we focus on educating the whole child. Our staff is committed to the responsive classroom model that shows consistent language and modeling throughout the school. Some aspects that are implemented with fidelity include modeling expected behaviors, using logical consequences, including students in creating class rules and expectations, and creating a safe learning environment where all are welcomed and respected. We value both frequent and open communication between home and school.

00:01:44,735 --> 00:02:00,265
Please keep your contact information updated with the school and district so that you will be sure to receive our weekly updates and newsletters. On a personal note, I am a proud mother of two beautiful daughters in their first years of college. My husband and I are now officially empty nesters.

00:02:00,776 --> 00:02:27,841
My educational journey began as a special ed paraprofessional in Medford 29 years ago. After spending four years in this position, I was hired in Tewksbury Public Schools where I spent 19 years in various positions before returning to Medford in 2017. I was honored to be the assistant principal here for three years before being hired as the principal in 2020. And I'd like you to know that if you ever have any questions, comments, or concerns in between communications, to always feel free to contact me at any time.

00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:43,302
Please know that I truly believe in collaboration between home and school as it is the key to a successful school year, because when we work together, everyone achieves more. I look forward to working as a team with all of you this school year, and I thank you for taking the time to watch this.
