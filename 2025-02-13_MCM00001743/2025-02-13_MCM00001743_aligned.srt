1
00:00:00,831 --> 00:00:01,592
Welcome everyone.

2
00:00:01,712 --> 00:00:05,254
My name is Sal DiStefano, Director of Economic Development.

3
00:00:06,135 --> 00:00:12,199
Thank you for joining us today as we discuss improving the cleanliness of our squares in Medford.

4
00:00:12,879 --> 00:00:18,502
I'm joined by Jessica Martinez, our Director of Planning and

5
00:00:19,623 --> 00:00:26,186
our planner of economic development, sorry, and several members of the City of Medford team.

6
00:00:26,946 --> 00:00:40,251
And as we are accepting people into this webinar, shortly Steve Smearday, our Director of Communications, will kick us off.

7
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:42,312
So I will hand it to Steve.

8
00:00:48,506 --> 00:00:50,307
Thank you everyone for joining us today.

9
00:00:50,327 --> 00:00:51,988
Like Sal said, my name is Steve Smerdy.

10
00:00:52,068 --> 00:00:54,589
I'm the Director of Communications for the City of Medford.

11
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,511
Before we get into the presentation, I just wanted to mention a few things.

12
00:00:59,451 --> 00:01:08,596
You'll be hearing from a few different speakers outlining the City's Improving the Cleanliness of Our Squares initiative and what this will mean for your business's waste and recycling operations.

13
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:22,354
So speaking today will be our Public Works Commissioner, Tim McGivern, the City's Waste and Recycling Consultants, Jeremy Drake and Gary Liss from Strategy Zero, as well as Heather Billings from Recycling Works.

14
00:01:22,434 --> 00:01:25,476
And you already heard from Sal, who's going to speak a little later as well.

15
00:01:26,536 --> 00:01:31,099
Our speaking portion will run roughly 30 to 35 minutes and a Q&A will follow.

16
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:33,780
So please hold your questions until that time.

17
00:01:35,074 --> 00:01:45,121
During the presentation, you can post your questions in the chat, or if you prefer, during the Q&A section, you can hit the hand up emoji, which is accessible by clicking the reaction button on the bottom of your screen.

18
00:01:45,541 --> 00:01:48,423
Looks like a little heart, probably, or maybe a face.

19
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:50,124
And I will call on you.

20
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:59,311
I also wanted to note that the city will be holding square-specific meetings and going into more depth about this program beginning at the end of August.

21
00:01:59,832 --> 00:02:10,060
The Zoom registration links for those meetings are available at medfordma.org slash squares, and you will also find more info on this initiative at that web address.

22
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,643
Uh, we're recording this meeting currently, and then we'll post it to that address as well.

23
00:02:14,703 --> 00:02:17,325
And it will also be available on Medford community media.

24
00:02:18,146 --> 00:02:20,468
As well as the slides that the presentation has.

25
00:02:21,088 --> 00:02:28,214
So, please also check, sorry, also check the chat for any additional links that we're going to be posting throughout the meeting to kind of help.

26
00:02:29,075 --> 00:02:35,500
Help support this so again, thank you all for being here and now I'm going to hand it off to Tim to take it over.

27
00:02:38,055 --> 00:02:38,976
All right, thank you, Steve.

28
00:02:40,056 --> 00:02:40,677
Welcome, everybody.

29
00:02:40,697 --> 00:02:42,318
Steve, can you advance the slides?

30
00:02:42,378 --> 00:02:43,819
We're still seeing the title slide.

31
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:44,479
Oh, sure.

32
00:02:44,499 --> 00:02:44,699
Sorry.

33
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:45,460
Excellent.

34
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:46,661
No sweat.

35
00:02:50,623 --> 00:02:50,983
Wonderful.

36
00:02:52,144 --> 00:02:52,424
All right.

37
00:02:52,684 --> 00:02:54,265
So we'll start again.

38
00:02:54,305 --> 00:02:55,586
Thanks for coming.

39
00:02:56,287 --> 00:03:03,091
Hopefully, we provide you with some information here at a high level, and we can then spend some time with your questions.

40
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:05,813
But the big question, why are you here?

41
00:03:06,633 --> 00:03:10,134
is really a couple of goals here that the city has.

42
00:03:10,694 --> 00:03:17,896
We started a transition into a new contract period, so we have all new waste contracts right now that started on July 1st.

43
00:03:18,056 --> 00:03:35,760
And part of the initiative is to try to transition away from public costs to get things more in line with the rest of the city, clean up the situation within the squares when it comes to disposal, trash being the major one there, as you can see.

44
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:47,224
You know, and I think you're familiar, there's a variety of issues in each square when it comes to trash collection so we're going to give a good go here to try to resolve as many as we can.

45
00:03:48,285 --> 00:03:52,626
So, and that's that's why you're here because it is going to impact your business and how you operate.

46
00:03:54,718 --> 00:03:58,261
The focus for this meeting is business districts and businesses.

47
00:03:58,381 --> 00:04:08,009
So if you're here for some other reason, if you could refrain from questions, I really want the focus to be on the folks who run the operations at each of the businesses and squares.

48
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:11,552
So a lot of those businesses are very small, I understand.

49
00:04:11,572 --> 00:04:13,594
A lot of them are more medium-sized.

50
00:04:13,714 --> 00:04:17,317
So we understand there's a business-to-business approach here.

51
00:04:18,947 --> 00:04:30,035
You know, one of the things that's really important that can't be stressed enough is the idea of having clean streets and having it organized and look like we know what we're doing out there when it comes to trash pickup.

52
00:04:30,575 --> 00:04:31,296
So that's important.

53
00:04:31,436 --> 00:04:34,858
The city budget is another important thing that we try to be mindful.

54
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:40,963
And then fairness is another big topic here that we want to try to improve fairness and transparency.

55
00:04:42,243 --> 00:04:45,506
The reason this is happening now is because of the new contracts I mentioned.

56
00:04:45,606 --> 00:04:48,048
So the contract that

57
00:04:49,272 --> 00:04:52,193
you know, a municipal pickup now is going to involve compost.

58
00:04:52,793 --> 00:05:11,301
The broad goals of that system are to reduce our trash disposal, because that's the hardest and most costly really, increase recycling, and transition things like business districts and condominiums and other aspects of the system into a more fair and transparent type of system.

59
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,187
So that's kind of a very high-level overview of where this started.

60
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,248
We've been working on this for about two years or longer.

61
00:05:22,608 --> 00:05:28,849
And this is a critical piece here towards the final transition into the new contracts.

62
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:32,070
And you're going to see timelines in this presentation.

63
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:41,932
You're going to see some requirements that are new and that we are going to have to figure out how to manage.

64
00:05:43,103 --> 00:05:46,465
And there's obviously benefits to the new system.

65
00:05:46,485 --> 00:05:48,225
Hopefully the streets are cleaner.

66
00:05:48,285 --> 00:05:49,246
It's a more organized look.

67
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:54,968
You have a solution for your business when it comes to your trash disposal and your waste disposal.

68
00:05:55,909 --> 00:06:01,271
And as was already mentioned, we're trying to maintain all this information in one place on the web.

69
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:05,253
So as we kind of move forward, we have the square individual meetings.

70
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:09,155
That information will continue to be updated.

71
00:06:09,595 --> 00:06:17,101
And one of the things I've been saying since the beginning, as the person who manages all these contracts, it's really important to me that there's a collaborative effort here.

72
00:06:17,221 --> 00:06:21,304
We do have some timeline issues, and we have some requirements that we have to get around.

73
00:06:21,344 --> 00:06:26,629
But the most important thing to me, and it's really how I'm trying to steer the ship, is to work with you folks.

74
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:36,416
And that's why we went to the chamber early, and try to understand, try to get in your heads a little bit, and try to see if we can make a transition that works well for everybody the best that we can.

75
00:06:36,516 --> 00:06:38,018
So that's what brings us here today.

76
00:06:38,718 --> 00:06:40,961
So again, thank you, and I'll pass it off to Jeremy.

77
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:45,226
Oh, this is me.

78
00:06:45,246 --> 00:06:45,467
Sorry.

79
00:06:45,847 --> 00:06:46,368
Requirements.

80
00:06:46,528 --> 00:06:53,517
So I mentioned some of these in my opening remarks, but this is an example as part of the transition to

81
00:06:56,788 --> 00:07:02,271
the cost to the private side for waste disposal, like it is in the rest of the city.

82
00:07:02,912 --> 00:07:06,674
One of the steps in that transition will be using city approved overflow bags.

83
00:07:07,114 --> 00:07:13,478
So instead of putting just white or black trash bags on the street, as of January 1st, those wouldn't be picked up anymore.

84
00:07:13,698 --> 00:07:18,661
Now, if you need to use bags, you're using overflow bags, the green bags, and those will be available.

85
00:07:18,962 --> 00:07:22,844
We're working with retailers in each square to try to get those in there.

86
00:07:22,864 --> 00:07:24,285
You'll hear more about that later.

87
00:07:25,505 --> 00:07:31,588
And the goal, you know, is to get that trash into containers eventually, but it's a transitional step.

88
00:07:32,328 --> 00:07:35,729
There's a couple of ordinances that we're also managing to comply with.

89
00:07:35,769 --> 00:07:45,853
That's the 1992 requirement for recycling, as well as the 2024 revision, which requires dual service, both trash and recycling for private haulers.

90
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:49,174
So that's something that we have to contend with as well.

91
00:07:51,841 --> 00:08:08,796
And then the, the, the contract for trash and recycling, possibly composting services through private haulers before May 1 2025 and that's an important date, because that's when you know the city is no longer paying for those services.

92
00:08:09,897 --> 00:08:10,638
by May 1st, 2025.

93
00:08:10,918 --> 00:08:17,120
So, you know, like I said, we have enough, I think, transition material to make this effective.

94
00:08:18,181 --> 00:08:21,882
And first step is to get all the information we can out to you folks.

95
00:08:22,303 --> 00:08:23,383
So, thank you.

96
00:08:25,997 --> 00:08:26,797
Thank you, Tim.

97
00:08:26,997 --> 00:08:27,758
Hello everybody.

98
00:08:27,838 --> 00:08:28,978
My name is Jeremy Drake.

99
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:31,459
I'm with Strategy Zero Waste Solutions.

100
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:41,664
My colleague Gary and I have been working with Tim and other folks at the City of Medford on the new waste and recycling system for

101
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:43,805
just about two years now.

102
00:08:45,345 --> 00:08:51,728
And we are really excited about all the progress that's been made on development of this new system.

103
00:08:52,188 --> 00:09:01,312
Wanted to walk you through the timeline starting with July of this year through to that May date that Tim just referenced.

104
00:09:02,293 --> 00:09:06,114
And we can talk in more detail about this when we get to the Q&A.

105
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:11,897
So if any of these things raise questions for you, please mark those down and we'll be sure to answer them.

106
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:15,193
So as Tim mentioned, starting July 1, 2024,

107
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:22,325
Revised solid waste ordinance went into effect.

108
00:09:22,425 --> 00:09:30,372
So that ordinance was adopted back in December, 2023 by city council and it went into effect July 1.

109
00:09:31,192 --> 00:09:41,100
And that date was to coordinate with the effective date of also the city's new solid waste recycling and composting contracts.

110
00:09:41,861 --> 00:09:45,284
So those are all now started as of July 1.

111
00:09:46,778 --> 00:10:00,092
Today, July 17th, is the official day of when technical assistance begins to help businesses in the squares make it through this transition that we're talking about with this initiative.

112
00:10:01,093 --> 00:10:07,199
We're gonna hear more about that from Heather Billings of Recycling Works after my comments.

113
00:10:09,045 --> 00:10:15,777
Starting August 27th and ending September 11th, we're having a series of the square specific Zoom meetings.

114
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:18,462
There's going to be one for each square.

115
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:29,582
And then there's going to be one catch-up meeting for folks who, for one reason or another, missed their square-specific meeting so that they can ask questions, get some more information.

116
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:40,305
And the point of having one meeting per square is that we understand that there's geographic differences and challenges to each square and to

117
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:42,365
places within each square.

118
00:10:42,726 --> 00:10:47,387
So we want to make sure that we give proper attention to each situation.

119
00:10:47,407 --> 00:10:50,428
We can dig in a little deeper than we're going to get to today.

120
00:10:50,448 --> 00:10:58,031
And it's really going to be what you're talking with talking with Heather Billings about potential solutions.

121
00:10:58,391 --> 00:10:59,132
And that's where that

122
00:11:00,152 --> 00:11:01,293
That's really going to start.

123
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:06,275
You can also start before that, as we'll learn in a few minutes.

124
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:18,059
But those are the next touch points from the city as a public meeting occurrence coming up at the end of August.

125
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,941
Tim mentioned the overflow bags.

126
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:29,244
So the requirement, January 1, 2025, for folks that are still using bags for trash,

127
00:11:30,245 --> 00:11:36,551
will be to put trash in overflow bags that are purchased at a retailer in town.

128
00:11:37,591 --> 00:11:43,877
Starting in September, the city is going to work to identify retailers in each square that can sell overflow bags.

129
00:11:43,957 --> 00:11:47,480
So for businesses in squares, you don't have to go too far.

130
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:51,444
If you're doing bags, there's going to be a store down the street where you can buy them.

131
00:11:52,652 --> 00:11:56,477
Two bucks a bag, rolls of five, 33 gallons per bag.

132
00:11:56,497 --> 00:11:57,338
You've probably seen them.

133
00:11:57,398 --> 00:12:01,364
If you're a Medford resident, you're probably familiar with these bags.

134
00:12:01,384 --> 00:12:04,348
They're the same ones that residents use for their overflow trash.

135
00:12:05,834 --> 00:12:26,068
September through March, the technical assistance continues with Recycling Works to help businesses and properties transition from bags and trash to containers, which could be carts or dumpsters for trash, and also to implement the recycling collection, as Tim mentioned, will be enforced starting in 2025.

136
00:12:29,318 --> 00:12:36,780
January 1, as we mentioned, that's when the overflow bag requirement begins for businesses that are still using bags for trash.

137
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:46,763
April 1 is an important date because this is where, as Tim mentioned, there's two sides to recycling.

138
00:12:47,543 --> 00:12:56,225
One side is the original solid waste ordinance from 92 that said all commercial entities have to recycle in the city of Medford.

139
00:13:00,203 --> 00:13:06,867
That's been happening to some extent, not necessarily everywhere, and it's been happening in different ways.

140
00:13:08,008 --> 00:13:22,236
As we transition into this new system, it might make sense for the property that you're building is in to have a dumpster for recycling instead of setting boxes out on the street, or maybe even more appropriate than carts.

141
00:13:24,597 --> 00:13:31,460
And if that's true, then there's going to be a new dumpster permitting process that will begin April 1st, 2025.

142
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:35,121
And so we're working through that with the Board of Health now.

143
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:40,783
As you know, if you have a dumpster, those dumpsters are required to be permitted by the Board of Health.

144
00:13:41,283 --> 00:13:50,527
And we're working through a revision to that permitting process to bundle the permit fees for dumpsters so that if you need to get a second dumpster,

145
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:55,508
For recycling, you won't pay a second fee for that dumpster.

146
00:13:55,528 --> 00:14:01,910
We want to make sure that you all understand that the city is working to support more recycling.

147
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:11,493
We're trying to remove barriers to recycling with this, because we know recycling is more cost effective, and it's better for the city, it's better for the planet.

148
00:14:13,504 --> 00:14:14,985
That's part one of April 1.

149
00:14:15,265 --> 00:14:27,489
Part two of April 1 is the new 2024 revised ordinance that requires any trash hauler in the city of Medford to also provide recycling service.

150
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:37,092
So that's a way that it's kind of a wraparound that the service is then going to finally support the requirements on businesses to recycle.

151
00:14:38,428 --> 00:14:47,130
Well, we can talk more about it later, but as Tim mentioned, City has new collection contracts.

152
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:53,591
Waste Management, WM, is the company that's doing trash and recycling.

153
00:14:54,071 --> 00:15:02,833
And they do have rates set for commercial businesses in that contract that

154
00:15:03,793 --> 00:15:05,294
incentivize recycling.

155
00:15:05,534 --> 00:15:10,017
The cost of recycling service is far lower than the cost of trash.

156
00:15:11,578 --> 00:15:18,363
Finally, May 1, 2025, that's when the enforcement of the revised solid waste ordinance begins.

157
00:15:18,803 --> 00:15:31,492
That's when haulers are required to report to the city who their customers are and what services they're receiving so that the city can verify that the haulers are in compliance with the new recycling requirement.

158
00:15:33,275 --> 00:15:34,837
That's the timeline overview.

159
00:15:35,898 --> 00:15:39,123
Happy to answer any questions about it when we get to the Q&A.

160
00:15:39,183 --> 00:15:41,746
And for now, I will pass it over to Heather Billings.

161
00:15:44,469 --> 00:15:44,770
Thank you.

162
00:15:46,742 --> 00:15:48,243
I am Heather Billings.

163
00:15:48,363 --> 00:15:58,127
I work for a nonprofit who is contracted with the state to offer the Recycling Works in Massachusetts program.

164
00:15:58,647 --> 00:16:11,773
And that is free technical assistance for businesses and institutions to help evaluate their waste and look at reducing, donating, and diverting materials.

165
00:16:12,633 --> 00:16:20,582
So what we're talking about for Medford is helping businesses look at their existing waste streams.

166
00:16:21,142 --> 00:16:28,350
Because if you're not already recycling, you may not know what is recyclable in the trash and what is not.

167
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:32,254
So what we'll do is kind of look at what you

168
00:16:33,376 --> 00:16:44,028
Generate in your different businesses and the quantities and so that will help figure out what types of containers are going to work best in your establishment.

169
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:52,378
And it could be a variety of things like a set up container or a car or a small dumpster or shared dumpster.

170
00:16:53,707 --> 00:16:57,389
So we're going to look at the service options as well available.

171
00:16:58,509 --> 00:17:08,293
And so, besides just what the container would look like, what are the different service providers that are available to you in the area.

172
00:17:08,854 --> 00:17:11,395
So we'll help with that kind of decision making.

173
00:17:11,915 --> 00:17:12,935
And so,

174
00:17:16,877 --> 00:17:32,687
talk about what materials are recyclable, and that is cardboard, kind of the box board, which is like a cereal box, newspapers, magazines, office paper, metal, glass, and plastic, bottles, jars, jugs, and tubs.

175
00:17:33,727 --> 00:17:46,437
And so there's resources available on the on the city website as well and on the fact sheet and frequently asked questions page about knowing what materials are recyclable.

176
00:17:47,197 --> 00:17:53,082
Because we want to make sure that trash goes in trash and recycling goes in recycling and that the two aren't mixed.

177
00:17:54,497 --> 00:18:00,262
For businesses that would like to set up a food scrap collection program for compost, we will assist with that as well.

178
00:18:01,063 --> 00:18:07,548
And then things like choosing a bin, where do you set it up in your establishment for the easiest use?

179
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:09,690
What kind of signage are you going to use?

180
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:16,195
And then support when you have questions, individual questions about, you know, how this will work in your business.

181
00:18:17,577 --> 00:18:17,937
Next, please.

182
00:18:24,368 --> 00:18:31,590
So the dates of the squares meetings are here and they are also listed on the website with the registration links.

183
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:44,132
And so this will be hour long Zoom meetings to talk about the service options and solutions for the different squares.

184
00:18:44,572 --> 00:18:46,253
And it'll be a chance to kind of

185
00:18:48,235 --> 00:18:57,438
consider ideas if there are kind of space challenges in certain areas, how that might be overcome.

186
00:18:57,998 --> 00:19:02,119
We're gonna hear about an example from Haines Square of a pilot in a little bit.

187
00:19:02,719 --> 00:19:09,421
There may be some shared solution partnerships that come up in these meetings.

188
00:19:10,422 --> 00:19:17,824
So it'll be kind of a local, they're meant to be just local conversations for the specific squares.

189
00:19:19,215 --> 00:19:19,615
Next please.

190
00:19:22,577 --> 00:19:28,421
So to sign up for technical assistance starting today, we'll do it whichever way you're feeling comfortable.

191
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:33,644
You can go on the link on the top, recyclingworks.com slash getassistance.

192
00:19:33,784 --> 00:19:35,745
And that's gonna bring you to a signup form.

193
00:19:36,526 --> 00:19:44,951
If you'd like to use the QR code, you can take your phone on the camera app and you can shine it right on the QR code.

194
00:19:45,411 --> 00:19:52,055
And don't take a picture of it, but just a little pop up will come up and you can go right to that link.

195
00:19:52,215 --> 00:19:53,636
And that's also a form.

196
00:19:54,416 --> 00:20:00,240
Now the form has the basics, name, address, contact information.

197
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:01,800
That's what we really need.

198
00:20:01,841 --> 00:20:03,321
And those are required fields.

199
00:20:03,802 --> 00:20:14,408
And then after that, if you know other answers to things like what you generate, what services you already have, what you're interested in, you can fill those in if you'd like, but it's not required.

200
00:20:15,479 --> 00:20:25,122
And then feel free to contact me directly either by email or on my phone, you know, if technology isn't your thing and I'll sign up for you.

201
00:20:25,302 --> 00:20:31,524
And then we'll talk about how best to get you some specific assistance.

202
00:20:31,664 --> 00:20:33,524
And most likely it's going to be a visit.

203
00:20:33,544 --> 00:20:38,385
I'm going to try to stack them on one day and I have, you know, a team of people like me.

204
00:20:38,465 --> 00:20:40,426
So we'll figure out how to get you what you need.

205
00:20:40,446 --> 00:20:43,367
I'm ready for Tim.

206
00:20:43,427 --> 00:20:43,727
Thank you.

207
00:20:45,831 --> 00:20:46,251
Thanks Heather.

208
00:20:46,711 --> 00:20:47,572
So this will be quick.

209
00:20:48,272 --> 00:20:52,074
We decided to see if we could get an early start in Haines Square.

210
00:20:52,714 --> 00:21:09,343
So there's not a ton of progress, but we have met with some of the business owners in Haines Square, and we have also identified a location for potentially a shared container system, if that's an option for some of these folks, and we get that approved with the traffic commission.

211
00:21:09,383 --> 00:21:12,824
So we get some legs, next steps are to, you know,

212
00:21:14,045 --> 00:21:30,097
to see if we can talk to the rest of the owners, especially on this block of the business, whoever leads operations really, whether it's an owner or a manager, to see if we can come up with some solutions, including a potential shared container solution system.

213
00:21:30,217 --> 00:21:41,366
So more to come there, but it's hopefully going to allow us to learn a little bit about some of these tools before we fully implement them elsewhere.

214
00:21:42,427 --> 00:21:42,647
Thank you.

215
00:21:46,942 --> 00:21:48,503
Okay, now we're at our Q&A portion.

216
00:21:49,283 --> 00:21:52,364
So if anyone has any questions, you can either use the hand up emoji.

217
00:21:52,724 --> 00:21:53,844
Like I said, that's at the bottom.

218
00:21:53,904 --> 00:22:00,287
If you hit the react button, it looks like a heart and you can raise your hand or you can enter them into the chat or you could raise your hand.

219
00:22:00,607 --> 00:22:02,847
So if anyone has any questions, we can get started.

220
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,192
All right, looks like no one has any questions.

221
00:22:16,653 --> 00:22:18,135
Want to make sure we give them time for everybody.

222
00:22:18,155 --> 00:22:23,380
Oh, there's a question from Kelly seeing flown.

223
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:26,724
Do you have an estimate cost or will it vary by business?

224
00:22:27,265 --> 00:22:28,166
Tim, if you want to take that.

225
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:32,128
Sure, it's really going to vary by business.

226
00:22:32,229 --> 00:22:47,335
We have negotiated some costs in the contract that we have with waste management that businesses could take advantage of, but that's not stopping you from the free market and private haulers as well.

227
00:22:51,552 --> 00:22:59,242
The costs are going to vary based off of your volumes, really, whether you're one container of trash or a dumpster full of trash.

228
00:22:59,843 --> 00:23:02,766
So hopefully that answers your question.

229
00:23:03,607 --> 00:23:05,610
They said, if it's variable, what is the criteria?

230
00:23:08,577 --> 00:23:09,578
Well, volume.

231
00:23:09,618 --> 00:23:16,143
So, you know, do you need one container, one small container for trash?

232
00:23:16,303 --> 00:23:21,467
Or do you have an option for a shared container for trash because you generate such a small amount?

233
00:23:22,248 --> 00:23:27,312
Or if you if you have a large amount of trash, do you currently have a dumpster?

234
00:23:27,812 --> 00:23:29,033
Is it shared dumpsters or not?

235
00:23:29,854 --> 00:23:30,194
How much?

236
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:32,876
Trash do you generate?

237
00:23:32,936 --> 00:23:34,136
How often does it get empty?

238
00:23:34,156 --> 00:23:37,338
So these are all kind of questions that affect cost.

239
00:23:37,398 --> 00:23:42,960
Right now, the situation is I think whatever gets put out in the street gets picked up.

240
00:23:44,381 --> 00:23:48,363
And then she asked, do you have an idea of the price of the small container?

241
00:23:48,383 --> 00:23:51,525
Jeremy, do you have that at your fingertips?

242
00:23:52,105 --> 00:23:54,586
Yeah, hi there, folks.

243
00:23:57,726 --> 00:24:05,451
So as Tim mentioned, we do have a sense of rates with WM.

244
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:17,599
And so I want to stress how through the contracting process with WM, we've been able to establish an approach to rates.

245
00:24:18,339 --> 00:24:23,243
If you choose to go with WM as your private hauler,

246
00:24:24,247 --> 00:24:27,209
you will avail yourselves to the rates that we help negotiate.

247
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:34,254
And what those look like are a lower cost for recycling than for trash.

248
00:24:34,374 --> 00:24:48,244
So for an example, the cart service, 64 gallon cart for trash, which is the standard residential size trash cart in Medford, that's 22.42 per month for weekly collection.

249
00:24:51,135 --> 00:25:02,260
A 96-gallon cart for recycling, also the standard Medford residential size cart, is $10 a month for weekly collection.

250
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:13,306
You're paying less than 50 percent for more recycling by using the rates that the city negotiated with WM for the new contract.

251
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:19,174
You may be able to find a better price with another hauler in the city of Medford.

252
00:25:19,654 --> 00:25:23,637
However, those recycling rates are pretty low.

253
00:25:24,638 --> 00:25:40,189
And the reason why they're low is because the city negotiated a deal with WM that all recycling picked up in the squares or all commercial cart service for recycling can be collected

254
00:25:40,989 --> 00:25:48,357
using the trucks used for the city's citywide collection route for residents.

255
00:25:48,858 --> 00:26:02,092
So someone's picking up residents, sorry WM is picking up recycling from residents around Hillside and there's businesses in Hillside that have WM's recycling cart service

256
00:26:03,053 --> 00:26:12,722
That truck will just go right past those businesses, pick those up with the same truck that's being used for the residential route, and the business doesn't pay processing.

257
00:26:13,362 --> 00:26:18,887
That's how we were able to get that rate so low for recycling, because you were only paying for the cost of collection.

258
00:26:19,608 --> 00:26:20,689
for that recycling.

259
00:26:21,190 --> 00:26:33,103
If you're going to go with another hauler for recycling, they would charge you for the collection cost and also the assumed processing cost for whatever they assume is in your cart.

260
00:26:34,343 --> 00:26:49,996
So for a month of weekly trash and recycling of this arrangement, 64-gallon trash, 96-gallon recycling through WM, the most you would pay per month would be $32.42 for that.

261
00:26:51,938 --> 00:27:01,506
Kelly just follows up with, so this would add between $45 to $70 per month for both trash and recycling in our budget for business that have small amounts, correct?

262
00:27:03,253 --> 00:27:16,341
If you had a 64-gallon cart, you'd pay $22.42 a month for weekly collection and $10 a month for the 96-gallon recycling cart for weekly collection.

263
00:27:16,561 --> 00:27:25,586
The total cost to you to have both trash and recycling through the rates negotiated with WM is $32.42 per month.

264
00:27:29,622 --> 00:27:33,205
If that ends up being the correct solution for that location.

265
00:27:34,206 --> 00:27:34,747
Exactly.

266
00:27:35,207 --> 00:28:02,365
other solutions available shared containers is one if you generate a small amount of trash and those containers seem too big and then you have we've all we're also keeping on the table an idea of smaller bins because we've already run across some situations where the insides of buildings don't have enough space for the larger bins and the the amount of trash that's generated is very small and there's no good shared location and so

267
00:28:02,865 --> 00:28:10,431
Anyway, the point I'm making is that all options are still on the table as far as solutions.

268
00:28:11,592 --> 00:28:15,796
So this is just, these should be seen as example solutions at the moment.

269
00:28:17,317 --> 00:28:19,358
Maybe a few people joined during that.

270
00:28:19,859 --> 00:28:22,821
So if anyone had other questions, let's see.

271
00:28:22,841 --> 00:28:27,245
Steve Pompeo asked, can multiple businesses share the WM bins?

272
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:31,669
I'm happy to answer that.

273
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:32,630
So thanks, Steve.

274
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:33,571
That's a great question.

275
00:28:34,192 --> 00:28:37,135
Shared service is one possible solution here.

276
00:28:37,255 --> 00:28:49,667
So for example, if there's three businesses on a storefront adjacent to one another, and none of them make a whole lot of trash or recycling, then they could come

277
00:28:50,203 --> 00:28:55,646
together and make an agreement amongst themselves as to how they're going to handle that.

278
00:28:55,806 --> 00:29:06,252
If they can do one cart, like the cart scenario I described, if that would work for three businesses and they can figure out, hey, look, let's split that three ways.

279
00:29:06,272 --> 00:29:10,755
We each pay $10 a month, then we can have our service.

280
00:29:10,935 --> 00:29:11,535
Absolutely.

281
00:29:11,595 --> 00:29:16,298
That's part of this, what Tim is referring to as shared service approach.

282
00:29:17,265 --> 00:29:39,540
That requires some creative out-of-the-box thinking and would require businesses to cooperate and figure out a way to be accountable to one another and have an arrangement that everybody can live with and figure out who's paying the bill, who's paying to cover that.

283
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:40,680
But it's doable.

284
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:42,141
It's done in other communities.

285
00:29:42,541 --> 00:29:56,969
We've got some examples that we will get into in the square specific meetings about how this can be done with shared agreements and reporting to the city to make sure everybody knows what's going on.

286
00:29:57,649 --> 00:30:00,370
These are some of the ways that it's been done in other communities.

287
00:30:00,991 --> 00:30:04,052
But that's an example of how multiple business could share

288
00:30:05,613 --> 00:30:10,898
Any bin, could be the WM bins, it could be another bin, it could be carts, it could be dumpsters.

289
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:20,508
It's more of a concept of the sharing that that's about.

290
00:30:20,528 --> 00:30:22,690
I think Lindsay had a question.

291
00:30:25,905 --> 00:30:27,986
Hi, I'm Lindsay from Goldilocks.

292
00:30:28,146 --> 00:30:34,270
So just from like how to proceed as a business, we got like the letter.

293
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:38,512
I didn't recognize that there was like a push for this is to help push towards recycling.

294
00:30:38,532 --> 00:30:40,633
So I'm glad that I attended this meeting because now I know what we're doing.

295
00:30:40,973 --> 00:31:10,600
because to us it's basically we called waste management right now we pay $7.50 a year we're getting quoted $3.10 a month so significant like four times what we pay now for basically the same service because we are just like the only business in our little neighborhood so they go by they pick up ours they pick up our neighbors that are in normal houses so we are getting like we're talking to waste management they're calling us it's like a wholesale situation i can't tell if we're getting the best deal and also like should we just wait till these august meetings to sign i don't want them to not pick up our trash because obviously that's gross

296
00:31:11,641 --> 00:31:14,405
What, what I guess is the guidance or who can I talk to.

297
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:18,210
Well, I think.

298
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:23,658
How much trash do you generate?

299
00:31:24,498 --> 00:31:41,046
I mean, we can get into specifics here, but there is a, I don't believe your business is in one of the business districts that we're talking about today, but you should look at whether or not you qualify for the municipal service as a smaller resident-like business.

300
00:31:41,387 --> 00:31:43,187
I'm not sure how much waste you generate.

301
00:31:45,045 --> 00:31:47,287
But that's what you should look at.

302
00:31:47,588 --> 00:31:53,654
I'm not familiar enough with your business and your trash operation to know where you fall on the new contract.

303
00:31:53,734 --> 00:32:01,842
But for example, there's a 2,500 square foot threshold that we're using for building size, basically establishment size.

304
00:32:02,202 --> 00:32:04,224
And if you generate similar trash,

305
00:32:06,446 --> 00:32:11,888
as a resident, basically one bin of each, trash and recycling, then you may qualify for the municipal service.

306
00:32:11,908 --> 00:32:13,048
So things may not change for you.

307
00:32:13,388 --> 00:32:16,530
So I think that's important to note to answer that question.

308
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:23,932
Can I just interrupt there also?

309
00:32:23,972 --> 00:32:25,153
Lindsay, I'm happy to talk to you.

310
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:37,562
you know, directly on this, you know, maybe we can set up a time, you know, on a certain day to pop by, or we can do a video call, you know, kind of do a walkthrough that way.

311
00:32:40,784 --> 00:32:40,985
Sorry.

312
00:32:41,105 --> 00:32:49,771
Yeah, I just want to mention too, that you can sign up to kind of have a one-on-one meeting with Heather at the website at medfordma.org slash squares.

313
00:32:50,111 --> 00:32:53,053
And I think Recycling Works will kind of run through a lot of this with you.

314
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:56,319
All right, I'm trying to, there were a few questions in the chat.

315
00:32:56,339 --> 00:32:58,239
Sorry, just hold on a second.

316
00:32:58,999 --> 00:33:01,800
Kelly asked, will trash day vary or the same for everyone?

317
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:03,880
Tim?

318
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:04,280
Yeah.

319
00:33:04,561 --> 00:33:14,083
It's going to depend on if you are using the waste management services, because for example, they're not, they're going to use efficiency of route.

320
00:33:14,203 --> 00:33:20,905
So if they're, they're traveling through a certain area, they're going to want to pick up your trash then we recycling.

321
00:33:21,665 --> 00:33:22,425
But if you have a,

322
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:36,109
If you have a dumpster in the back of your business and you're getting it emptied however much you need it emptied, whether it's every day, every week, every two weeks, whatever those requirements are.

323
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:40,913
What is the deadline for businesses to sign up for the new system?

324
00:33:40,933 --> 00:33:45,496
Do you want to put the timeline slide back up?

325
00:33:46,417 --> 00:33:46,777
Oh, sure.

326
00:33:54,794 --> 00:34:02,858
This is the timeline, so really by, I believe it's May, is when the full transition is complete.

327
00:34:05,459 --> 00:34:08,420
Will there be a list of different service providers for us to choose from?

328
00:34:11,181 --> 00:34:14,062
There's a list of the Board of Health authorized waste haulers.

329
00:34:18,804 --> 00:34:23,228
Rudy says, from my experience, WM is overpriced and unreliable for private pickup.

330
00:34:23,569 --> 00:34:30,195
Okay, just more of a comment.

331
00:34:30,515 --> 00:34:33,939
You mentioned a 2,500-square-foot threshold.

332
00:34:33,979 --> 00:34:34,980
Can you please elaborate?

333
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:42,507
Is this saying a 500-square-foot storefront is not eligible if it's in a 300-square-foot building with five other small stores?

334
00:34:45,393 --> 00:34:46,714
I think your understanding is correct.

335
00:34:46,754 --> 00:34:53,657
So if the building as a whole is more than 2,500 square feet, then I believe you wouldn't trigger that eligibility.

336
00:34:54,857 --> 00:35:00,940
The other one is important to the amount of waste you generate as well as an important consideration.

337
00:35:03,281 --> 00:35:06,363
And then when and can we have a link for the list?

338
00:35:08,624 --> 00:35:09,424
I'm working on that.

339
00:35:12,534 --> 00:35:14,355
Okay, so we'll have that up on the website as well.

340
00:35:14,935 --> 00:35:29,282
Once again, I'll put it in the chat just so everyone.

341
00:35:29,622 --> 00:35:30,982
Yes, the link can be mailed to you.

342
00:35:31,022 --> 00:35:34,424
We have all your emails through the registration, so you can compile it that way.

343
00:35:37,645 --> 00:35:40,327
Okay, are there any other, oh, maybe.

344
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,901
All right, are there any other questions?

345
00:35:44,322 --> 00:35:47,164
Put in the chat, you can do their hand up emoji.

346
00:35:48,525 --> 00:35:52,107
Just so folks know, I just pasted the link to the holler list in the chat.

347
00:35:56,190 --> 00:36:04,295
Would you consider changing that threshold to per business since most small stores are in twenty five hundred square foot or more build buildings?

348
00:36:07,557 --> 00:36:08,938
Well, we're going to try the

349
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:13,917
the service that we've negotiated into a contract and that threshold.

350
00:36:15,058 --> 00:36:19,521
The reasoning is behind how buildings may be managed differently.

351
00:36:20,842 --> 00:36:28,187
So you may have one business building that wants to manage the garbage differently for their leases.

352
00:36:28,668 --> 00:36:33,071
So in order to accommodate that in the eligibility, that's where that came from.

353
00:36:33,171 --> 00:36:36,153
So we are going to listen to feedback.

354
00:36:37,494 --> 00:36:40,395
But that is what we have to work with currently.

355
00:36:40,695 --> 00:36:44,415
So we're going to move forward with it and see if we can make it work.

356
00:36:44,715 --> 00:36:50,716
And if there are flaws or critiques, we will listen and see if we need to do anything about it.

357
00:36:53,677 --> 00:36:54,897
Any other questions?

358
00:36:56,678 --> 00:37:00,798
I also just want to note that we have a FAQ up on the site as well.

359
00:37:01,038 --> 00:37:04,119
So if there are any other follow-up questions, they may be answered there.

360
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:08,093
Steve, can I jump in for a minute?

361
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:26,379
I'm wondering if Tim or Jeremy or Gary would be willing to talk just for a minute about the benefits of just overall handling waste better in our community, something that everybody will benefit.

362
00:37:26,919 --> 00:37:31,000
I believe I'd love to turn it over to the experts to just address that.

363
00:37:31,942 --> 00:37:49,153
Sure, I can talk about mid for specific things and I think maybe Jeremy or Gary could talk about a little bit more of a broader views in W, but here in Medford you know we're really looking to reduce the number of ways taller trucks on the roads that that benefits everybody.

364
00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:52,795
That's you know less road where less space on the roads.

365
00:37:53,475 --> 00:37:54,336
the trash is taken up.

366
00:37:55,037 --> 00:37:58,419
So providing those types of efficiencies.

367
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:01,122
Another thing is clean and organized.

368
00:38:02,122 --> 00:38:07,667
So we're a little bit behind the times on this one, and that's OK, because we've had long-term contracts.

369
00:38:08,428 --> 00:38:11,710
And these contracts typically can last up to 10 years.

370
00:38:11,791 --> 00:38:13,652
So we're entering a new 10-year phase now.

371
00:38:14,092 --> 00:38:15,113
So things are going to change.

372
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,436
And when we change, we want to change for the better.

373
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:21,519
So we're really looking at, you know,

374
00:38:22,358 --> 00:38:28,641
cleaner, better, more organized, reducing the amount of trash, reducing costs that the city has when it comes to processing that waste.

375
00:38:29,541 --> 00:38:32,382
So that's why you're seeing compost now as a city service.

376
00:38:32,802 --> 00:38:34,363
That is the way to go.

377
00:38:34,383 --> 00:38:37,985
You will see other communities following suit, I believe.

378
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:45,588
Just the plain facts on human society waste disposal is leading us in that direction.

379
00:38:46,468 --> 00:38:48,950
So that's what really Medford is looking at.

380
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:54,053
So the affordability, the cleaning up and organizing, the

381
00:38:57,616 --> 00:39:14,588
The transparency and fairness is also another big piece to this administration and making sure that there's, the contracts in place are fair and folks know exactly what we're doing and kind of removing some of the mystery to it.

382
00:39:15,028 --> 00:39:16,129
So there's that piece as well.

383
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,890
So hopefully that explains it.

384
00:39:17,971 --> 00:39:23,635
I think Gary, Jeremy can talk about more of a national perspective on this.

385
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:27,038
Yeah, I'll add a couple of pieces.

386
00:39:27,158 --> 00:39:38,869
So one that is not specific to Medford, but is a challenge across all of the East Coast from Worcester to New York City, rats.

387
00:39:40,886 --> 00:39:46,990
And bagged trash is a invitation to rats.

388
00:39:48,151 --> 00:40:04,543
So the Board of Health a couple of years ago approved a compost cart that has a latching lid because they know that when we take the food out of the trash and put it in the cart, it's harder for the little pests to get at it.

389
00:40:05,643 --> 00:40:08,204
And so that was the first step into this direction.

390
00:40:08,865 --> 00:40:18,289
What we now know from communities across the East Coast is that the ultimate step is getting bags off the streets if you want to deal with rats.

391
00:40:18,889 --> 00:40:26,593
New York City is really, the new mayor over there is on a crusade to free New York City of rats.

392
00:40:26,893 --> 00:40:29,414
And just this past March 1,

393
00:40:30,795 --> 00:40:39,003
They implemented a new rule in the city of New York that all commercial trash must be in containers.

394
00:40:39,544 --> 00:40:45,189
If you've ever been to New York, they're famous for their mountains of black trash bags, but that's a thing of the past now.

395
00:40:46,290 --> 00:40:53,878
This is the direction that cities are moving in because of the public health and the cleanliness of the city.

396
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,900
The other piece is litter.

397
00:40:58,221 --> 00:41:08,125
Rats crack open bags, bags get opened, and litter can blow around.

398
00:41:08,145 --> 00:41:11,906
I know we've seen wind in the squares around Medford, Massachusetts.

399
00:41:14,093 --> 00:41:18,936
Getting that stuff out of bags and into carts or other containers also will reduce litter.

400
00:41:19,457 --> 00:41:25,361
So ultimately, when we improve the cleanliness of the squares, it's better for everybody.

401
00:41:25,481 --> 00:41:35,148
It's better for business owners if patrons aren't walking past bags of trash or litter on the streets, concerned about rats on the streets.

402
00:41:35,808 --> 00:41:45,792
So the rats in the litter piece are a big driver for this effort that Medford's doing in multiple communities on the East Coast.

403
00:41:47,812 --> 00:42:05,259
I would also add sustainability is definitely a part of the driver that was identified by the task force that the mayor appointed at the beginning of this process that included a variety of citizens from various backgrounds.

404
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:26,136
They came up with goals for guiding the development of the new waste and recycling system for Medford, which we should probably post in this website for the business districts to provide additional clarification of overall goals.

405
00:42:26,477 --> 00:42:34,023
But one of them that hasn't been mentioned is sustainability and recycling more, composting more,

406
00:42:34,595 --> 00:42:58,537
reducing the creation of trash and minimizing the amount of trash being generated, all contribute to addressing climate change and becoming more efficient in the providing of services needed to address trash in Medford.

407
00:42:59,083 --> 00:43:07,190
So sustainability is definitely one of the goals that the city adopted and is important for climate change and beyond.

408
00:43:08,892 --> 00:43:10,313
Okay, two questions here.

409
00:43:11,675 --> 00:43:14,217
Will Medford trucks no longer pass by the square?

410
00:43:14,377 --> 00:43:15,478
What about the residents?

411
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:18,501
The garbage trucks?

412
00:43:19,342 --> 00:43:21,704
Yeah, we're not saying that trucks aren't passing through the squares.

413
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:27,883
Most businesses in the square put their trash bins on the sidewalk on the designated trash day.

414
00:43:28,043 --> 00:43:32,767
If each business has different pickup days, won't this lead to trash bins being out every day?

415
00:43:34,917 --> 00:43:37,398
That's a, we don't want to cause more problems.

416
00:43:37,678 --> 00:43:44,441
So, um, if, if we're landing with bins, I think there's going to be efficiencies that you see in using waste management bins.

417
00:43:45,262 --> 00:43:49,724
As a gentleman was mentioning the costs, you know, we, we did plan that, uh, in the negotiations.

418
00:43:49,904 --> 00:44:01,389
So because the, the disposal costs are covered, but not the collection costs, then that provides an efficiency, which results in lower costs for you.

419
00:44:01,409 --> 00:44:02,970
Okay.

420
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:12,327
Okay, any, oh, Steve Fabio says, I think everyone is in favor of carts versus bags.

421
00:44:12,407 --> 00:44:17,711
If the businesses in the squares had been allowed to use WM carts all along, they probably would have.

422
00:44:17,891 --> 00:44:21,153
So can these businesses now just sign up with WM for carts?

423
00:44:25,296 --> 00:44:30,360
Well, it's a good question.

424
00:44:31,853 --> 00:44:40,635
I think what we're going to land on is businesses will have waste management carts and they will be picked up on the regular routes that they have.

425
00:44:41,275 --> 00:44:45,817
Um, it may be a little premature to say that that is the preferred solution at this point.

426
00:44:45,837 --> 00:44:48,317
Okay.

427
00:44:50,098 --> 00:44:51,318
Um, okay.

428
00:44:51,338 --> 00:44:52,138
Any more questions?

429
00:44:52,218 --> 00:44:52,958
Anyone?

430
00:44:53,138 --> 00:44:53,559
Another one.

431
00:44:53,659 --> 00:44:57,219
Are there any other haulers that are being looked at as far as pricing goes?

432
00:44:59,160 --> 00:44:59,240
No.

433
00:45:04,434 --> 00:45:06,356
Okay, any other questions?

434
00:45:10,061 --> 00:45:10,421
Why not?

435
00:45:12,864 --> 00:45:13,184
Say again?

436
00:45:13,805 --> 00:45:16,869
Why aren't other haulers being looked at as far as pricing?

437
00:45:19,171 --> 00:45:20,333
Well, I guess the

438
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:30,602
To understand that answer a little bit better, we did consider pricing of other haulers when we did the contracting for this service.

439
00:45:31,043 --> 00:45:40,433
So in other words, we received bids back from a whole bunch of what theoretically was supposed to receive bids back from everybody who's interested in the project.

440
00:45:40,894 --> 00:45:42,776
So that's when the opportunity exists.

441
00:45:43,236 --> 00:45:46,898
existed for the city to review additional pricing from other contractors.

442
00:45:47,318 --> 00:45:57,764
So because we're a public procurement process, we went with the low bidder for the waste services, which is WM, and that is the one we were able to negotiate with.

443
00:45:58,244 --> 00:45:59,505
So that is what we have to offer.

444
00:46:10,465 --> 00:46:24,906
I just like to clarify that the commercial businesses can look at other haulers and that's why we mentioned earlier that there's a list that the Board of Health has and the link

445
00:46:25,607 --> 00:46:27,188
was put in the chat by Jeremy.

446
00:46:29,930 --> 00:46:39,796
Businesses are open to contact other haulers to try and get a best price for both trash and recycling services.

447
00:46:40,956 --> 00:46:51,323
Those best prices, you need to ensure that by May 1 of 2025, include both trash and recycling services.

448
00:46:52,121 --> 00:46:59,888
Jeremy highlighted earlier, you might be able to get a lower trash rate, but not necessarily a lower recycling rate for the reasons already explained.

449
00:47:02,513 --> 00:47:10,515
There are co-benefits to going with WM for the services in the squares, right?

450
00:47:10,935 --> 00:47:15,677
If there's one truck for trash, as there not necessarily is now.

451
00:47:15,717 --> 00:47:20,258
I mean, there's businesses that require more than one day of trash service.

452
00:47:20,278 --> 00:47:25,119
I've seen lots of pictures of Republic dumpsters in the squares.

453
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:30,861
So WM is not the only hauler servicing squares presently.

454
00:47:32,165 --> 00:47:42,912
However, you know, a move where everybody's using the same hauler would reduce the number of trash trucks that are driving around in the squares day to day.

455
00:47:43,532 --> 00:47:56,320
So that's something to consider, you know, as kind of like, if you consider the square as a community of businesses, like what's the best solution for the community, as well as what's the best solution for each individual business.

456
00:47:57,947 --> 00:48:05,351
Tim, could you just elaborate a little bit more on, Kelly had a question that if each business has different pickup days, won't this lead to trash bins out every day?

457
00:48:05,371 --> 00:48:09,954
I think she's concerned that people will continually pass by trash outside.

458
00:48:10,514 --> 00:48:13,015
And that's what I was just getting at, right?

459
00:48:13,075 --> 00:48:17,538
If everybody does use WM, you know when your trash is going to be set out.

460
00:48:17,878 --> 00:48:21,340
If you're using carts, they're going to pick up carts on Tuesday morning, just like they do now.

461
00:48:22,898 --> 00:48:30,760
If your neighbor decides they can go with Joe's hauling and Joe's hauling comes by on Wednesday, then your neighbor's trash cart's gonna be out on Wednesday.

462
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,160
And maybe they save five bucks a month.

463
00:48:33,981 --> 00:48:43,243
And what is the value of that $5 in the context of how that extra trash truck and that cart out on the other day of the week impacts the whole community as a whole?

464
00:48:43,843 --> 00:48:47,884
And that's where I think it's really a community thought

465
00:48:49,547 --> 00:48:53,930
process to determine, it's not just like, how much is it going to cost me and my business?

466
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:58,052
What's the impact on the community when I make those choices for my business?

467
00:48:58,212 --> 00:49:04,496
And what's the benefit that can be brought to the entire business community in the square?

468
00:49:05,576 --> 00:49:08,558
And Kelly asked, can the city may be limited to two or three days?

469
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:10,819
I assume you mean trash pickup to two or three days.

470
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:13,261
What about weekends?

471
00:49:14,805 --> 00:49:15,906
That's not a bad idea.

472
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:17,127
And I don't think that's off the table.

473
00:49:17,568 --> 00:49:32,942
So if we do land in a situation where we have multiple pickup days in a square, trying to limit it is definitely an option for all the reasons that Jeremy said, for all the reasons that we are trying to do this the best we can.

474
00:49:38,087 --> 00:49:39,208
Any other questions?

475
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:54,355
Again, I put in the chat, but if anything comes to you later, you can email businessdistricts at medford-ma.gov and we'll get your questions answered as well.

476
00:49:54,735 --> 00:49:55,836
I think there are a few more, sorry.

477
00:49:55,856 --> 00:50:08,462
The vast majority of businesses in West Medford Square and probably other squares are in buildings greater than 2,500 square feet, so I think small businesses are misunderstanding that the WM service will be available to them.

478
00:50:10,023 --> 00:50:11,144
Comment from Steve Pompeo.

479
00:50:14,029 --> 00:50:14,589
What's the question?

480
00:50:14,609 --> 00:50:23,394
I don't know if anyone wants to comment on if small businesses are, if they understand this or not, that the WM service will be available to them.

481
00:50:27,716 --> 00:50:28,196
They may not.

482
00:50:28,216 --> 00:50:30,657
I'm not sure how to, if it's a question though, Steve.

483
00:50:30,997 --> 00:50:31,217
Okay.

484
00:50:31,438 --> 00:50:36,340
Yeah.

485
00:50:36,360 --> 00:50:37,380
Just another comment from Kelly.

486
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:40,942
I'm afraid if trash is out every day, the walking clients will diminish.

487
00:50:40,962 --> 00:50:42,203
A lot of people like to take walks.

488
00:50:44,356 --> 00:50:44,989
That's a good comment.

489
00:50:47,082 --> 00:50:50,783
And the entire purpose of this initiative is, it's in the name, right?

490
00:50:50,823 --> 00:50:52,984
Improving the cleanliness of our squares.

491
00:50:53,624 --> 00:50:58,166
The purpose isn't making sure that trash carts are out every day of the week.

492
00:50:58,746 --> 00:51:10,229
If that becomes an unintended consequence, then we need to, as Tim suggested, re-evaluate and see what changes need to be made to address that.

493
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:11,770
That was the result.

494
00:51:16,297 --> 00:51:20,480
We have about five minutes left, so we probably have time for one more question.

495
00:51:20,500 --> 00:51:23,902
I don't know if anyone has any.

496
00:51:24,263 --> 00:51:31,668
Again, you can email businessdistricts at medford-ma.gov, and you can also check out our FAQ at medfordma.org slash squares.

497
00:51:32,948 --> 00:51:34,049
We'll follow up.

498
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:37,672
You can also email me directly or Tim or

499
00:51:38,516 --> 00:51:39,758
And we'll get your question answered.

500
00:51:40,739 --> 00:51:42,401
So I don't see anything else.

501
00:51:43,102 --> 00:51:46,727
And I think it goes over to Sal, I think, to kind of wrap this up.

502
00:51:49,813 --> 00:51:50,794
Yes, thank you, Steve.

503
00:51:51,454 --> 00:52:08,348
So as you see in the calendar, we have some upcoming square-specific meeting dates listed below, and then on September 10th, a catch-up meeting for anybody who missed their square-specific meetings.

504
00:52:08,408 --> 00:52:13,592
But I just wanted to thank everybody that attended today.

505
00:52:14,733 --> 00:52:18,336
I know that there are still questions, but there's resources here to help.

506
00:52:19,816 --> 00:52:36,080
And I have to say that in the businesses that I've worked with and business leaders have complimented Tim and his staff at DPW who have been helping businesses come up with solutions.

507
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:40,541
And we're here to help.

508
00:52:40,661 --> 00:52:47,023
So as we mentioned earlier, our goal is for Medford to be a cleaner, more welcoming place.

509
00:52:47,863 --> 00:52:54,546
and a place that is conducive to public health and enjoyment.

510
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,948
So once again, we thank everybody for coming.

511
00:52:57,988 --> 00:52:58,888
This is not the end.

512
00:52:58,948 --> 00:53:00,089
This is just the beginning.

513
00:53:01,029 --> 00:53:04,171
Please join us at your square-specific date.

514
00:53:06,672 --> 00:53:08,473
I hope to see you there.

515
00:53:08,853 --> 00:53:09,573
Thank you very much.

516
00:53:09,833 --> 00:53:15,175
Also, Heather's info is below for business-specific technical assistance.

517
00:53:16,215 --> 00:53:18,916
As she mentioned, she's willing to have one-on-one meetings.

518
00:53:21,037 --> 00:53:23,297
Please take her up on that if you have questions.

519
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:24,818
I'll turn it over to Jeremy.

520
00:53:26,082 --> 00:53:26,742
Thanks, Sal.

521
00:53:26,882 --> 00:53:34,764
I just wanted to make a request of the folks here, reiterate Sal's gratitude for showing up.

522
00:53:36,184 --> 00:53:39,525
11 representatives from the squares I know is not everybody.

523
00:53:40,425 --> 00:53:47,487
So if you have neighbors in your square, please tell them about these upcoming meetings.

524
00:53:47,607 --> 00:53:55,069
We want to get as many people as we can involved in this so that they can get the support that they need to feel like they

525
00:53:55,909 --> 00:54:00,113
they've got the help to make it through what this process is going to entail.

526
00:54:00,994 --> 00:54:09,442
And so please invite your neighbors, invite other folks, friends from the squares to make sure that we can get as many people as we can to these meetings.

527
00:54:09,462 --> 00:54:17,490
I just want to know that you can register for those meetings at MedfordMA.org slash squares, depending on obviously which square your business resides in.

528
00:54:19,997 --> 00:54:23,038
And just, I think there's a comment about Friday.

529
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:31,660
All these meetings, I believe, are on Tuesdays, Wednesday, I think it's Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and then Tuesdays and Wednesdays.

530
00:54:33,401 --> 00:54:35,821
We avoided Mondays and Fridays when we were scheduling these.

531
00:54:36,222 --> 00:54:37,622
And they're all at 3 p.m.

532
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:44,764
Visit the website medfordma.org slash squares to register for your own meeting.

533
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:48,605
Okay.

534
00:54:55,394 --> 00:54:58,497
That's Thursday.

535
00:54:59,959 --> 00:55:00,640
That's a Thursday.

536
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:01,621
Yeah.

537
00:55:01,721 --> 00:55:01,961
Okay.

538
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:03,022
Well, thanks everybody.

539
00:55:03,082 --> 00:55:09,969
Again, please head over to the website medfordma.org slash squares and there's plenty of resources and info there.

540
00:55:10,069 --> 00:55:12,572
So thanks again, everybody for attending and we'll see y'all soon.

541
00:55:12,932 --> 00:55:13,132
Thanks.

542
00:55:13,293 --> 00:55:13,593
Thank you.
