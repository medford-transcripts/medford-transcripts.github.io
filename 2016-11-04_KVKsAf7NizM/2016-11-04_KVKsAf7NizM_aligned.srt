I'm the lady.

00:01:12,607 --> 00:01:14,267
I'm a comic book character.

25
00:01:14,287 --> 00:01:14,888
I'm a cop.

00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:15,568
She's Robert.

27
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:16,328
I'm an alien.

28
00:01:16,428 --> 00:01:17,228
I'm a crayon.

29
00:01:18,108 --> 00:01:19,649
I'm one of the three blind mice.

30
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:21,109
I'm a Power Ranger.

31
00:01:29,552 --> 00:01:32,135
I'm trying to find my sisters at the library.

32
00:01:32,155 --> 00:01:33,316
Oh, they were over here.

33
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:33,876
It's this way.

34
00:01:33,896 --> 00:01:34,177
Stop!

35
00:01:34,777 --> 00:01:35,919
It's that way.

36
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:36,880
Which way?

37
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,200
This way.

38
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,221
I'll take you.

39
00:01:38,301 --> 00:01:39,562
Hi, I'm Miss She-Helm.

40
00:01:39,722 --> 00:01:40,603
Happy Halloween.

41
00:01:52,823 --> 00:01:56,746
Growing up in high school, I used to play tennis, soccer, and basketball.

42
00:01:56,986 --> 00:02:00,129
And I actually didn't start volleyball later on until college.

43
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:04,412
The question of the week is, what is one of my most valuable possessions?

44
00:02:10,236 --> 00:02:13,499
What college did you go to, and how did you decide to go there?

45
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,982
So I went to, for my undergraduate, I went to Salem State.

46
00:02:18,142 --> 00:02:21,425
And then for my graduate degree, I went to Middlebury.

47
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:23,680
So I went to UMass Amherst.

48
00:02:24,921 --> 00:02:29,165
It was one of the greatest experiences of my life, I would have to say.

49
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:31,347
I went to Westfield State University.

50
00:02:32,008 --> 00:02:34,330
I attended Bowdoin College in Brunswick, Maine.

51
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,253
I went to Ithaca College in upstate New York.

52
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,663
I went to Union College in Schenectady, New York.

53
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:45,367
And for graduate school, I went to Boston University in Boston.

54
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,569
I went to the University of Southern California, USC Trojans.

55
00:02:49,190 --> 00:02:55,996
I went to Northeastern University in Boston for undergraduate, and I got my master's there as well.

56
00:02:56,316 --> 00:02:57,777
I went to Bridgewater State University.

57
00:02:57,857 --> 00:02:58,658
It's down south shore.

58
00:02:59,118 --> 00:03:00,939
I went to Bridgewater State College.

59
00:03:01,199 --> 00:03:04,522
For undergrad college, I went to Washington University in St.

60
00:03:04,542 --> 00:03:05,162
Louis, Missouri.

61
00:03:05,542 --> 00:03:12,107
I went to UMass Amherst for my undergraduate and graduate degrees and had a wonderful experience there.

62
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:16,330
I earned a bachelor's degree in English and journalism and a master's degree in education.

63
00:03:16,657 --> 00:03:24,523
it was great because you actually playing a fall sport you get to go on the earlier side so you would you come I think about two weeks earlier than the first day of school.

64
00:03:24,943 --> 00:03:28,806
And what was your favorite memory and experience about Bridgewater State?

65
00:03:29,187 --> 00:03:33,350
My favorite memory was winning the intramural family feud.

66
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,350
I am the champion.

67
00:03:34,651 --> 00:03:36,672
They called it Spanish boot camp.

68
00:03:36,932 --> 00:03:39,414
I actually didn't speak any English at all.

69
00:03:39,434 --> 00:03:40,155
They actually have

70
00:03:40,975 --> 00:03:44,018
a slogan which is called No English Spoken Here.

71
00:03:44,038 --> 00:03:47,081
It just felt like home the second I stepped on the beautiful campus.

72
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:50,704
It had a number of the courses I wanted to take, areas of interest.

73
00:03:51,325 --> 00:03:53,086
It wasn't too big, it wasn't too small.

74
00:03:53,427 --> 00:03:56,830
One thing that stood out is that I performed in the marching band at UMass Amherst.

75
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:02,635
So I had the opportunity to go down when George W. Bush was inaugurated as president.

76
00:04:02,755 --> 00:04:06,258
I had the opportunity to perform at the inauguration with the UMass marching band.

77
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:14,406
My favorite personal memory was I got to be a seat filler at the Oscar Awards, because the Oscars were shot about a block from where I was living.

78
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:22,310
I had some wonderful co-op jobs, so I got to travel around the country and meet a lot of people.

79
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,470
That was the highlight.

80
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:25,311
I also met my husband at Northeastern.

81
00:04:25,531 --> 00:04:32,334
I can happily say that on the football field, I never lost to Mr. Nascimento or any of the Tufts Jumbos.

82
00:04:33,035 --> 00:04:33,635
I met my wife.

83
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:36,228
Were you involved in any clubs at the school?

84
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:39,110
So I tried a number of activities while I was at school.

85
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,150
I was in a choir.

86
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:44,252
I worked at a TV station on campus.

87
00:04:44,992 --> 00:04:47,554
I did volunteer work with incoming freshmen.

88
00:04:47,774 --> 00:04:51,236
What advice do you have for students applying to college and going to college this fall?

89
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:59,940
I've been talking to a lot of seniors and there's this idea that you need to know exactly what you want to do before you go to college.

90
00:05:00,815 --> 00:05:02,416
And I don't think that's correct.

91
00:05:02,456 --> 00:05:07,360
I think actually college takes place to explore what's out there, to understand what you want to do.

92
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,282
When you're going through your applying stage, please tour your colleges.

93
00:05:11,322 --> 00:05:14,565
You definitely want to make sure that you get your good feel for this campus that you're going to.

94
00:05:15,045 --> 00:05:17,607
But once you're at school, make sure that you get involved.

95
00:05:18,107 --> 00:05:19,448
I would say do your research.

96
00:05:19,968 --> 00:05:21,109
Pick your schools wisely.

97
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:24,071
But number one, don't stress about it.

98
00:05:24,251 --> 00:05:25,212
It'll sort itself out.

99
00:05:25,587 --> 00:05:28,650
So I think there are three questions you need to ask yourself when you're applying to college.

100
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:31,533
First, do you want an urban or a rural setting?

101
00:05:32,173 --> 00:05:34,916
Secondly, do you want a large setting or a small setting?

102
00:05:35,436 --> 00:05:37,398
And thirdly, how far away are you willing to go?

103
00:05:38,119 --> 00:05:38,899
Apply and go.

104
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,040
You should.

105
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:41,522
You'll make more money than if you don't.

106
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:47,968
And my advice is to not do any classes before 9 or 10 o'clock in the morning.

107
00:07:45,143 --> 00:08:03,996
welcome welcome trick or treat shut the door have a seat come on in and rest your feet and sit here on the throne nice to meet you i'm your host hope you're not afraid of ghosts
