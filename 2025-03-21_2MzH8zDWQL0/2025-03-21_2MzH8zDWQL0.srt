[SPEAKER_10]: Seven members present, none absent, please rise to salute the flag.

18
00:00:21,806 --> 00:00:21,927
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

19
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:40,761
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-555 offered by Vice President Longo-Curran.

20
00:00:41,341 --> 00:00:53,483
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Metro City Council requests that the city solicitor assist the council in changing the six month demo delay for historic properties to a one to two year demo delay.

21
00:00:53,583 --> 00:00:54,403
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Vice President.

22
00:00:54,883 --> 00:00:56,363
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Dello Russo.

23
00:00:57,083 --> 00:01:06,425
[SPEAKER_16]: During our budget deliberations, we had the historic commission and the historic district commission before us and we had a couple nights of

24
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:14,534
[SPEAKER_16]: discussion with regards to a number of issues, one being this six-month demo delay that we have on the books currently.

25
00:01:15,655 --> 00:01:21,538
[SPEAKER_16]: Discussion was had with regards to extending that and asking for their opinion on it.

26
00:01:21,958 --> 00:01:24,159
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that was the historic commission.

27
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:34,665
[SPEAKER_16]: We asked Ryan Haywood for his opinion, and I think that will be coming to us shortly with regards to how we can go about and why we should go about extending this.

28
00:01:35,738 --> 00:01:36,498
[SPEAKER_16]: demo delay.

29
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:45,483
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe that a number of cities and towns have a one and some even a two-year demo delay, and I think that's something that the city of Medford definitely needs to look into.

30
00:01:45,503 --> 00:02:02,953
[SPEAKER_16]: We were told point blank that six months is not enough time to hire a consultant and prepare a report, and I think we need to give our historic commission more time to do the work that needs to be done so we can preserve these historic homes.

31
00:02:03,393 --> 00:02:05,174
[SPEAKER_16]: So I ask that while we're

32
00:02:05,894 --> 00:02:08,756
[SPEAKER_16]: awaiting Mr. Haywood's report.

33
00:02:09,076 --> 00:02:22,827
[SPEAKER_16]: We also request that the city solicitor begin, because I know he's busy and we are coming upon the summer months, so I ask that we begin making the change to our ordinance so that we can move forward on that sooner than later.

34
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:28,091
[SPEAKER_16]: I know we have a number of historic properties that ran into this issue.

35
00:02:28,111 --> 00:02:30,313
[SPEAKER_16]: I know there was one on Toro Ave.

36
00:02:31,394 --> 00:02:33,115
[SPEAKER_16]: Obviously, South Street has some historic

37
00:02:34,291 --> 00:02:43,277
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, not South, yeah, South Street, Toro, in that neighborhood, and there's a number of homes that would qualify for this six-month demo delay.

38
00:02:43,637 --> 00:02:57,005
[SPEAKER_16]: So I ask that the city council go on record requesting that the city solicitor create an update to our ordinance so we can pass that and create a longer time frame for this demolition delay.

39
00:02:57,465 --> 00:02:59,947
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion by Vice President Lagucurne, Councilor Knight.

40
00:03:00,605 --> 00:03:04,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, I too had a conversation with Mr. Ryan Haywood relative to this very same matter.

41
00:03:05,249 --> 00:03:09,933
[SPEAKER_09]: And he and I sat down and he pointed out what sections of the metric code of ordinances he was referring to.

42
00:03:09,953 --> 00:03:20,261
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether this is a matter that would be a change in our city ordinances, I'd recommend that the matter be referred to our zoning and ordinance subcommittee for a draft piece of paper that can be put together for the council to review.

43
00:03:23,206 --> 00:03:26,848
[SPEAKER_10]: We have two contradictory motions.

44
00:03:26,908 --> 00:03:30,130
[SPEAKER_09]: We can have the solicitor's input at that point as well, I think.

45
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:32,332
[SPEAKER_09]: He's always more than willing to help out with that stuff.

46
00:03:32,372 --> 00:03:34,433
[SPEAKER_09]: But it seemed very remedial, Mr. President.

47
00:03:34,453 --> 00:03:40,377
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a matter of crossing out six months and replacing it with the appropriate figure that we deem is proper at this point in time as a body.

48
00:03:41,797 --> 00:03:42,158
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

49
00:03:42,398 --> 00:03:44,139
[SPEAKER_09]: So, on that motion, Madam Vice President.

50
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:45,960
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we combine the two.

51
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:52,324
[SPEAKER_16]: We vote that we do want to increase the demo delay, and then we send it to subcommittee to make that change.

52
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,660
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a wise decision, Madam Vice-President.

53
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,321
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of Vice-President Algo-Kern, seconded by Councilor Knight.

54
00:04:00,681 --> 00:04:01,441
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

55
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:03,642
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

56
00:04:04,882 --> 00:04:06,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

57
00:04:06,482 --> 00:04:07,623
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-556 offered by Councilor Knight.

58
00:04:08,143 --> 00:04:22,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved the city administration adopt and implement a trench identification system where markers would be placed on trench work performed by public utilities for the purpose of holding contractors and public utilities accountable

59
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,309
[SPEAKER_10]: for work performed on our roadways.

60
00:04:25,189 --> 00:04:25,689
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

61
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:27,710
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

62
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:30,311
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is a pretty self-explanatory resolution.

63
00:04:30,851 --> 00:04:41,716
[SPEAKER_09]: It came out of our budget meetings two Saturdays ago when the city engineer explained to us that this is a process and a procedure and a policy in other communities, and it's been met with success, Mr. President.

64
00:04:41,736 --> 00:04:48,639
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it'll allow us the opportunity to identify the trench work that's being done by what public utility, and then we'll be able to hold them accountable.

65
00:04:48,679 --> 00:04:52,260
[SPEAKER_09]: If neighbors have a concern or a question, they can go out and look at the trench identification number.

66
00:04:52,931 --> 00:05:04,099
[SPEAKER_09]: The trench identification plates are coded by color so that you know what type of utility it is, whether it's electricity or water, and it allows a little bit easier quality of life issues in public service, Mr. President.

67
00:05:04,119 --> 00:05:05,299
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that this is a good measure.

68
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:08,802
[SPEAKER_09]: I also believe that it can be done at little or no cost to the taxpayer.

69
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:11,323
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd ask my colleagues to support it, and I move for approval.

70
00:05:11,884 --> 00:05:14,806
[SPEAKER_09]: On the motion approved by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks.

71
00:05:14,866 --> 00:05:15,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

72
00:05:17,127 --> 00:05:19,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, I think that's an excellent suggestion.

73
00:05:21,573 --> 00:05:35,825
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to solve an issue that this council has been trying to address for a number of years in, uh, addressing utility contractors that come into this community and do digging and don't put back, uh, the road, uh, the way they found it.

74
00:05:36,305 --> 00:05:39,588
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this is a wise suggestion and I support it wholeheartedly.

75
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,010
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

76
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:42,311
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

77
00:05:42,351 --> 00:05:44,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor chair recognizes council Scarpelli.

78
00:05:44,853 --> 00:05:45,733
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

79
00:05:45,814 --> 00:05:47,415
[SPEAKER_03]: I too commend my colleague to bring this.

80
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:50,594
[SPEAKER_03]: In front of us again, I think that it's important.

81
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:58,197
[SPEAKER_03]: I got two phone calls this week on some public utility work that was done over the last year by National Grid.

82
00:05:58,677 --> 00:06:00,538
[SPEAKER_03]: And now there are two open sinkholes.

83
00:06:00,618 --> 00:06:04,179
[SPEAKER_03]: So we forwarding that off to Mr. Cairns in the morning.

84
00:06:04,679 --> 00:06:15,283
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I hope this helps us give us an indication in who's not fulfilling their responsibilities as a utility company.

85
00:06:15,423 --> 00:06:15,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

86
00:06:17,004 --> 00:06:21,208
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Marks.

87
00:06:21,288 --> 00:06:22,089
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favour?

88
00:06:22,449 --> 00:06:23,150
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

89
00:06:23,671 --> 00:06:27,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion passes.

90
00:06:27,614 --> 00:06:29,936
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-557 offered by Councilor Knight.

91
00:06:30,297 --> 00:06:36,963
[SPEAKER_10]: We resolve the Park Commission explore possibilities to further diversify recreational opportunities provided at our public parks.

92
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:56,100
[SPEAKER_10]: including, but not limited to, horseshoe pits, bocce courts, volleyball courts, shuffleboard courts, street hockey rinks, canoe launches, pitch and putt areas, and body weight exercise equipment, and report back to the council the feasibility of expanding the offerings at our public parks.

93
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,780
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

94
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,421
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

95
00:06:59,221 --> 00:07:05,805
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing I noticed when I drive down the streets of our city is that we have some beautiful parks, some very large parks that take up quite a bit of acreage.

96
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,561
[SPEAKER_09]: But quite frequently, we don't see anybody utilizing them.

97
00:07:08,981 --> 00:07:10,422
[SPEAKER_09]: Quite frequently, we don't see anybody there.

98
00:07:10,482 --> 00:07:15,545
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that part of that has to do with the fact that we don't have diversified options for the residents of this community to participate in.

99
00:07:16,085 --> 00:07:25,230
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think some of these items are low-cost items, like a horseshoe pit or a bocce court or a shuffleboard court, Mr. President, that may bring people to our parks to utilize our open recreational space.

100
00:07:25,971 --> 00:07:29,993
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that it's important that we provide opportunities for the members of our community, children and adults alike.

101
00:07:30,529 --> 00:07:33,612
[SPEAKER_09]: to utilize these public open spaces, Mr. President.

102
00:07:34,033 --> 00:07:44,883
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also think it's important with the discussions that we have here going on with childhood obesity and addiction that we provide opportunities for our community to utilize the services and amenities that we have in place.

103
00:07:45,404 --> 00:07:46,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd ask my colleagues to support the resolution.

104
00:07:47,006 --> 00:07:48,407
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd ask for it to be taken in a roll call vote, Mr. President.

105
00:07:49,508 --> 00:07:50,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor.

106
00:07:50,629 --> 00:07:52,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

107
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:53,832
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

108
00:07:54,981 --> 00:08:06,305
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a great initiative and I think that it's something that's needed when you have an organized recreational program that we can identify in our community.

109
00:08:06,325 --> 00:08:16,389
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that the mayor has put together, I believe from what I hear is a task force looking into recreation in our community.

110
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:20,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's been echoed throughout our streets and neighborhoods and our parks.

111
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:22,832
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, I'd like to,

112
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:36,022
[SPEAKER_03]: make an amendment to follow that up to the mayor's office and where we stand with a recreation task force to see initiatives like this follow through with.

113
00:08:37,883 --> 00:08:39,863
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we can make an amendment to that motion.

114
00:08:40,363 --> 00:08:47,185
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Knight as amended and seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Madam Vice President.

115
00:08:47,245 --> 00:08:47,605
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

116
00:08:47,685 --> 00:08:53,046
[SPEAKER_16]: President Dello Russo, I think it's a great idea to look into some options, additional options for our

117
00:08:53,709 --> 00:08:57,211
[SPEAKER_16]: younger people that are using the park and, oh, well, everybody, I guess.

118
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,513
[SPEAKER_16]: Just looking to see if we can maybe amend it just to get some cost estimates as well.

119
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:07,516
[SPEAKER_16]: Feasibility costs, I think, will help us, you know, figure out what we can add to our parks.

120
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:08,596
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's a great idea.

121
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:10,957
[SPEAKER_10]: As amended by Vice President Long and Kern.

122
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:14,239
[SPEAKER_10]: All those, we have a roll call request.

123
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,420
[SPEAKER_10]: If Councilor Marks wants to speak.

124
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor, I'm sorry.

125
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

126
00:09:17,861 --> 00:09:20,462
[SPEAKER_05]: And I agree that our parks are underutilized.

127
00:09:20,482 --> 00:09:21,503
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe there's 23 parks

128
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:28,308
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the luxury of having a number of open spaces in our community.

129
00:09:28,688 --> 00:09:30,949
[SPEAKER_05]: However, they are not being used to full capacity.

130
00:09:31,589 --> 00:09:44,712
[SPEAKER_05]: It was probably about maybe six, seven months ago, I offered a resolution similar to this with involving the arts and how do we get the arts throughout the community and not just centralized in one particular area.

131
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:51,593
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know the city of Lowell has done a tremendous job in refurbishing some of their old parks

132
00:09:52,201 --> 00:10:07,291
[SPEAKER_05]: that were considered drug dens and brought in performing stages at very minimal cost and had artists do wrought iron work around the park and other things to attract residents back into the park.

133
00:10:07,811 --> 00:10:10,213
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're really a success story.

134
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:21,420
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would like to, if my council colleague wouldn't mind, amending his particular, I know you didn't limit it to what you put out there, but I think arts would be a great addition

135
00:10:22,215 --> 00:10:22,916
[SPEAKER_05]: to the community.

136
00:10:23,216 --> 00:10:32,383
[SPEAKER_05]: We already have a vibrant arts council and movement in this community, and I think it would go a long way in soliciting their support also.

137
00:10:32,763 --> 00:10:39,789
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would ask if my council colleague doesn't mind to also involve arts and the performing arts within our parks.

138
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:49,336
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Knight, seconded and amended by Councilors, uh, uh, Councilor Scarpelli, further amended by Vice-President Lalo Curran, Councilor Marks,

139
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:53,141
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

140
00:10:53,201 --> 00:11:01,062
[SPEAKER_19]: As I drive around during the summer, I see two or three park instructors with two or three kids.

141
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:15,885
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe if we could look into maybe combining the program into maybe fewer parks, fewer parks so we could get more children there rather than having two kids at a park or three kids at a park.

142
00:11:19,385 --> 00:11:24,806
[SPEAKER_19]: If we get them all into maybe one or two or three parks, and with these things, maybe that will be more successful.

143
00:11:25,326 --> 00:11:34,408
[SPEAKER_19]: And Mr. President, do you know if we'll be getting that grant from the East Cambridge Savers that we've gotten in the past to help fund the park instructors?

144
00:11:34,628 --> 00:11:35,428
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that coming forward?

145
00:11:35,828 --> 00:11:37,648
[SPEAKER_19]: I have no information on that, Councilor.

146
00:11:38,328 --> 00:11:40,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Point of information, Madam Vice President.

147
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:42,169
[SPEAKER_16]: We do have a paper before us.

148
00:11:42,609 --> 00:11:46,970
[SPEAKER_16]: I did read there's $10,000 from the same bank, correct, coming this year.

149
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:47,390
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes.

150
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:48,870
[SPEAKER_10]: OK, thank you.

151
00:11:51,767 --> 00:11:54,409
[SPEAKER_10]: Mayor McGlynn was instrumental in securing that over the years.

152
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:55,310
[SPEAKER_10]: Good man.

153
00:11:55,851 --> 00:11:57,732
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes Councilor Knight.

154
00:11:58,353 --> 00:11:59,153
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Mr. President.

155
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:01,896
[SPEAKER_09]: I certainly have no objection to the amendments that were made.

156
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:16,388
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Councilor Marksley's amendment is a great idea and it made me think about something that he brought up several months ago relative to graffiti walls where in certain areas and communities they put up graffiti walls and they allow people to write graffiti on them to

157
00:12:16,972 --> 00:12:20,993
[SPEAKER_09]: focus their energies and efforts on that site as opposed to on other pieces of property.

158
00:12:21,033 --> 00:12:23,713
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that that's just a perfect example of how that could come into play.

159
00:12:24,193 --> 00:12:25,373
[SPEAKER_09]: It takes a village, Mr. President.

160
00:12:25,413 --> 00:12:35,715
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the more heads that are at the table, the more minds that get together to see what offerings we can extend to our community to ensure that our parks are operating in the capacity is going to be helpful and it's going to improve our quality of life.

161
00:12:35,735 --> 00:12:38,436
[SPEAKER_09]: So I certainly have no problem with any of the amendments that were made, Mr. President.

162
00:12:38,776 --> 00:12:39,456
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd move for approval.

163
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:42,256
[SPEAKER_10]: On that motion, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

164
00:12:45,077 --> 00:12:45,977
[SPEAKER_16]: Read the amendments, please.

165
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:53,862
[SPEAKER_16]: Madam Clerk, could we just read the amendments?

166
00:12:53,982 --> 00:12:55,083
[SPEAKER_16]: I didn't know.

167
00:12:57,305 --> 00:12:58,786
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you read the last couple of amendments?

168
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:08,854
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Caraviello, are you making that an amendment or you just were talking?

169
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:13,018
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I just want to make sure that was an amendment because I just disagree.

170
00:13:13,118 --> 00:13:13,758
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, thank you.

171
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,001
[SPEAKER_10]: Please call the roll, Madam Clerk.

172
00:13:20,868 --> 00:13:22,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

173
00:13:23,209 --> 00:13:23,549
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

174
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:24,709
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

175
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:26,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

176
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:32,732
[SPEAKER_10]: With the vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative, the motion passes.

177
00:13:32,752 --> 00:13:45,777
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-558 offered by Councilor Knight to be resolved that the police department increase the visibility and enforcement of posted speed limits along Arlington Street during the weekday morning and afternoon rush hour periods.

178
00:13:45,837 --> 00:13:46,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

179
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:59,881
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Mr. President, I've gotten a number of calls and complaints, and I actually was walking down the Arlington Street area just a couple of days ago, and several residents in the area have requested that we see more visible enforcement of the posted speed limits.

180
00:14:00,701 --> 00:14:03,463
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think this is a problem that's exclusive to Arlington Street.

181
00:14:03,483 --> 00:14:12,350
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is something that's citywide, and I think we could all probably sit here and amend this paper over and over and over again to include all, I don't know, 100 plus miles of street here in the city of Medford.

182
00:14:13,191 --> 00:14:21,235
[SPEAKER_09]: However, there is a need down there, Mr. President, and I've been contacted by individuals in the neighborhood that would like to see some increased visibility, and I am asking for it.

183
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,857
[SPEAKER_09]: So, with that being said, I'd ask that the council move for approval.

184
00:14:25,217 --> 00:14:28,519
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion is approved by Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice President Logan Kern.

185
00:14:28,539 --> 00:14:29,339
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Vice President.

186
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:30,600
[SPEAKER_16]: I second that.

187
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,160
[SPEAKER_16]: That's fine.

188
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,222
[SPEAKER_16]: I do have... I don't believe we received an update.

189
00:14:36,262 --> 00:14:41,565
[SPEAKER_16]: I know we have piles of information to probably still read, but with regards to the speeding,

190
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:45,372
[SPEAKER_16]: Stepping up enforcement is definitely the main way to do it.

191
00:14:45,432 --> 00:14:53,216
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to see, you know, our police officers traverse in different streets where we know there's extra amount of speeding going on, which is a number of streets.

192
00:14:53,717 --> 00:14:59,080
[SPEAKER_16]: But also questions were asked to the chief of police with regards to the speed limit tracker, the signage.

193
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:03,242
[SPEAKER_16]: I know we have permanent ones on a few of our roads, which are working great.

194
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:07,465
[SPEAKER_16]: I know Elm Street is one that definitely I see speeding being curbed.

195
00:15:08,245 --> 00:15:11,167
[SPEAKER_16]: Definitely speeding slows down when people hit that sign.

196
00:15:11,602 --> 00:15:19,728
[SPEAKER_16]: But we have that movable sign that the chief of police did tell us at our Thursday meeting, I believe two weeks ago, stated it was broken.

197
00:15:19,808 --> 00:15:27,814
[SPEAKER_16]: We did ask for how much it would cost, and we asked that the mayor put at least one in the budget so that we can move that around to streets like Arlington Street.

198
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:33,098
[SPEAKER_16]: I know the last street I got complaints on was Highland Ave, excessive speeding.

199
00:15:33,178 --> 00:15:39,463
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think that's an extremely important tool that the city can use and that we have been without because it's been broken.

200
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:51,655
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just want to reiterate that, that we purchase one and get the one we have fixed, if possible, if it's worth the cost of fixing it versus buying one or two.

201
00:15:51,675 --> 00:15:53,876
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's something that the council brings up.

202
00:15:55,096 --> 00:16:06,080
[SPEAKER_16]: Once a month, we have a few different streets that are having a speeding problem, and that's something that definitely does help without the additional manpower or officer to sit there eight hours a day.

203
00:16:06,481 --> 00:16:07,321
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would ask that we

204
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,821
[SPEAKER_16]: again, ask those questions and purchase one.

205
00:16:09,881 --> 00:16:17,763
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't, it is not in the budget to purchase one this year and I think that, you know, we did request that and I hope that is changed by next week.

206
00:16:20,424 --> 00:16:25,325
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Vice-President Legault-Kern.

207
00:16:25,505 --> 00:16:26,405
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favour?

208
00:16:26,905 --> 00:16:27,665
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

209
00:16:27,785 --> 00:16:28,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

210
00:16:28,485 --> 00:16:35,747
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-559, offered by Councilor Knight, be it resolved that the public utility contractor performing work on Lincoln Road,

211
00:16:37,018 --> 00:16:42,342
[SPEAKER_10]: underground infrastructure project be required to perform weekly sweeping of the affected roadways.

212
00:16:42,843 --> 00:16:52,491
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it further resolved that all construction equipment, debris, and materials be removed from said affected roadway during the period of time that work is not being performed.

213
00:16:52,811 --> 00:16:53,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

214
00:16:54,072 --> 00:16:54,833
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Mr. President.

215
00:16:54,853 --> 00:16:55,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

216
00:16:55,653 --> 00:16:59,977
[SPEAKER_09]: If anybody's familiar with the area, Lincoln Road would run from Lawrence Road

217
00:17:00,512 --> 00:17:09,300
[SPEAKER_09]: up to Pilgrim Road, and there is a trench that extends probably that whole length, as well as a trench that extends halfway down Crocker Road, Mr. President.

218
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:12,663
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're doing some infrastructure repairs up there, which is all well and good.

219
00:17:13,383 --> 00:17:15,685
[SPEAKER_09]: However, the work's been going on for an extended period of time.

220
00:17:16,466 --> 00:17:20,049
[SPEAKER_09]: There's dirt and debris and sand and dust all over the vehicles.

221
00:17:20,349 --> 00:17:27,155
[SPEAKER_09]: And in a period of time where the weather is finally getting nice, individuals in this neighborhood are having a difficult time opening their windows during the weekends, Mr. President.

222
00:17:27,705 --> 00:17:38,998
[SPEAKER_09]: Because come Friday around 3 o'clock, the construction crews pack up in their trucks and they drive away, but they leave some pipes, and they leave some bobcats, and they leave some big piles of dirt on the side of the road, Mr. President.

223
00:17:39,379 --> 00:17:45,927
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a dense residential neighborhood with very small sidewalks, and it's really becoming a quality of life issue, Mr. President.

224
00:17:46,537 --> 00:17:53,782
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd ask that the city administration take the appropriate steps to have the public utility contractor beautify the area while the construction work is going on.

225
00:17:54,222 --> 00:17:59,225
[SPEAKER_09]: We already know that we're going to ask them to leave it in the same pristine condition that it was in before they came here, Mr. President.

226
00:17:59,966 --> 00:18:02,508
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it's an issue that needs to be addressed.

227
00:18:02,968 --> 00:18:07,791
[SPEAKER_09]: Neighbors are complaining the neighborhood looks atrocious with the amount of dust and dirt debris that's on the road.

228
00:18:08,552 --> 00:18:13,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Something that needs to be done is the least that the contractor could do based upon the disruption that they're causing the residents in the neighborhood.

229
00:18:17,773 --> 00:18:21,096
[SPEAKER_19]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, Councilor Caraviello.

230
00:18:21,276 --> 00:18:21,956
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

231
00:18:22,096 --> 00:18:25,058
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, this is not a problem that's unique to Crockett Road.

232
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:30,683
[SPEAKER_19]: This happens on many of the other streets in the city where work is being done.

233
00:18:31,263 --> 00:18:45,693
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't know why either our code enforcement officer isn't out there staying on top of this or why we don't have a clerk of the works who should be doing this and staying on top of these projects and staying on top of these gentlemen who are doing them to make sure that

234
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:59,983
[SPEAKER_19]: When they leave at night, the rotors are proper, and so the neighbors don't have to, it's bad enough that the work is being done, but they don't have to suffer the dust and everything, especially now during the summer when they're out in the yard.

235
00:19:00,023 --> 00:19:08,950
[SPEAKER_19]: So if we could find out if this is something that our, we have two code enforcement officers, if this is something that our code enforcement officer can handle.

236
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:10,691
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President.

237
00:19:11,872 --> 00:19:14,374
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

238
00:19:16,210 --> 00:19:20,252
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

239
00:19:20,272 --> 00:19:28,195
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-560, offered by Councilor Caraviello, be it resolved that the Medford City Council send its condolences to the family of Robert Sarabian, Councilor.

240
00:19:28,815 --> 00:19:29,555
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

241
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:42,820
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I've known Mr. Sarabian for many years, and maybe some of our younger people in the room may not know him, but he's a gentleman who was in the community for many years as the president of the Co-op Bank.

242
00:19:44,127 --> 00:19:50,290
[SPEAKER_19]: He's a former citizen of the air, and I know he's fell ill over the last few years.

243
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:59,556
[SPEAKER_19]: But again, he was a good man for the city of Medford for many years, and his presence in this community has been missed for many years.

244
00:20:00,156 --> 00:20:01,637
[SPEAKER_19]: So if we could hold a moment of silence for him.

245
00:20:02,878 --> 00:20:09,322
[SPEAKER_10]: Please join in standing for a moment of silence of this deceased Medford citizen.

246
00:20:22,442 --> 00:20:24,303
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a number of papers under suspension.

247
00:20:26,524 --> 00:20:28,205
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight, suspension of the rules.

248
00:20:30,425 --> 00:20:35,568
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Councilor Knight for suspension of the rules, take papers that were issued under suspension.

249
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:36,668
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

250
00:20:37,048 --> 00:20:37,749
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

251
00:20:38,229 --> 00:20:47,173
[SPEAKER_10]: Before us is a communique from the mayor, and here to present on the matter is the finance director, Ms.

252
00:20:49,323 --> 00:20:53,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Ann Baker, 16-568 under suspension.

253
00:20:53,567 --> 00:20:57,610
[SPEAKER_10]: To the Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council, City Hall, Medford Mass, 02155.

254
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:07,718
[SPEAKER_10]: To Mr. President and city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approve the following end of the year transfers for fiscal year 16.

255
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:11,041
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a sum total amount of $1,112,000

256
00:21:15,974 --> 00:21:30,621
[SPEAKER_10]: in various accounts, which I will enumerate, unless someone stops me, to pay deficits of that same amount in various accounts that are in deficit.

257
00:21:31,241 --> 00:21:43,868
[SPEAKER_10]: So, the brief synopsis is that we are taking money from salary, executive department, salary finance department, salary assessment department,

258
00:21:44,340 --> 00:22:12,166
[SPEAKER_10]: non-contributory pension, salary signal department, salary fire department, salary library, salary health, fringe compensations, salary forestry, salary highway, salary registrar, interest on debt, utilities, DPW, utilities building, utilities fire, cash aid for veterans, street lights, and canine services.

259
00:22:12,845 --> 00:22:22,732
[SPEAKER_10]: So those all of those accounts had monies left over them, some substantial, the two most substantial, salary fire, $255,000, and fringe wage compensation, $270,000.

260
00:22:22,772 --> 00:22:24,473
[SPEAKER_10]: So those all amounted to $1,112,000.

261
00:22:24,994 --> 00:22:28,016
[SPEAKER_10]: They're going to supplement shortfalls in budgets

262
00:22:37,988 --> 00:22:38,888
[SPEAKER_10]: Salary Council, $1,800.

263

[SPEAKER_10]: Treasury Department, $4,200.

00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:42,029
[SPEAKER_10]: Salary Law, $2,500.

00:22:42,149 --> 00:22:43,129
[SPEAKER_10]: Overtime Police, $416,000.

266
00:22:43,229 --> 00:22:44,150
[SPEAKER_10]: Salary Veterans Office, $1,500.

267

[SPEAKER_10]: Printing in the Registrar's Office, $11,000.

268
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:47,630

[SPEAKER_10]: Medicare Imbursements, $150,000.

270
00:23:07,526 --> 00:23:08,526
[SPEAKER_10]: and insurance for police, $25,000.

271
00:23:08,626 --> 00:23:14,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Here to explain any questions that the Councilors may have is Ms.

272
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:18,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Baker of the City Auditor.

273
00:23:18,968 --> 00:23:19,168
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes?

274
00:23:19,968 --> 00:23:22,669
[SPEAKER_15]: If you have any questions, I'd be glad to answer them if I can.

275
00:23:22,929 --> 00:23:25,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

276
00:23:25,469 --> 00:23:25,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Counsel Max.

277
00:23:27,009 --> 00:23:27,909
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

278
00:23:27,929 --> 00:23:36,851
[SPEAKER_05]: I think for the last, jeez, several months, I've been asking in this budget process that we receive a budget from the administration

279
00:23:37,473 --> 00:23:49,502
[SPEAKER_05]: that not only details the previous fiscal year and the proposed fiscal year, but also has a comparison, line by line, whether each line is in a deficit or surplus.

280
00:23:50,283 --> 00:23:53,485
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is the exact reason I've been asking this, Mr. President.

281
00:23:53,505 --> 00:24:01,651
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was promised last year by then-Budget Director Louise Miller that it would be incorporated in this year's budget.

282
00:24:02,532 --> 00:24:04,053
[SPEAKER_05]: And I, as one person,

283
00:24:04,794 --> 00:24:06,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how my colleagues feel.

284
00:24:06,835 --> 00:24:12,357
[SPEAKER_05]: When I look at a budget, it's helpful to look and say, well, you're asking for an appropriation.

285
00:24:12,977 --> 00:24:15,438
[SPEAKER_05]: Last year, did you spend this full appropriation?

286
00:24:16,018 --> 00:24:18,579
[SPEAKER_05]: If not, why are you asking for the same appropriation?

287
00:24:19,199 --> 00:24:31,923
[SPEAKER_05]: And every year, and we were just at a meeting, that we had a Committee of the Whole meeting, and before we received this correspondence from the mayor, I brought it up again, and I said, every year, there's roughly a million dollars

288
00:24:32,889 --> 00:24:36,250
[SPEAKER_05]: in transfers at the end of the year, every year without say.

289
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:38,891
[SPEAKER_05]: And sure enough, we get a paper from the mayor, it's $1,112,000.

290
00:24:39,351 --> 00:24:44,273
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was off by $112,000.

291
00:24:44,373 --> 00:24:52,356
[SPEAKER_05]: There is something inherently wrong with the budget every year that has a surplus of the same dollar amount.

292
00:24:53,157 --> 00:25:02,260
[SPEAKER_05]: That leads me to believe that these particular accounts are, you know, there's a buffer in certain line items.

293
00:25:03,013 --> 00:25:08,097
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know why the administration is so opposed to providing another line.

294
00:25:08,578 --> 00:25:13,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the budget, if you look at it, is three or four lines, three or four columns.

295
00:25:14,803 --> 00:25:17,445
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not complex to add another column.

296
00:25:17,685 --> 00:25:22,028
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have this information, whether a particular line would be in deficit or not.

297
00:25:22,749 --> 00:25:23,990
[SPEAKER_05]: And that would be helpful

298
00:25:24,588 --> 00:25:26,989
[SPEAKER_05]: as a member of the council when we're deliberating.

299
00:25:27,669 --> 00:25:31,410
[SPEAKER_05]: And I still don't know why we can't get that in the budget process.

300
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:33,191
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually thought one was prepared for you.

301
00:25:33,251 --> 00:25:36,112
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't deliver myself, but I thought one was prepared for you.

302
00:25:36,192 --> 00:25:38,133
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you didn't get it, I'm not sure why you didn't get it.

303
00:25:39,233 --> 00:25:42,334
[SPEAKER_15]: That showed comparison from this year, 16, to last year, 15.

304
00:25:42,754 --> 00:25:44,875
[SPEAKER_05]: We received something, but it wasn't line by line.

305
00:25:45,575 --> 00:25:51,577
[SPEAKER_05]: So in going through it to try to figure out what that applied to is next to impossible.

306
00:25:52,031 --> 00:25:53,934
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, let me just say a couple of things.

307
00:25:56,018 --> 00:25:58,102
[SPEAKER_15]: For instance, look at the line for workers' comp.

308
00:25:58,142 --> 00:26:00,446
[SPEAKER_15]: It shows a $270,000 surplus, right?

309
00:26:01,067 --> 00:26:04,132
[SPEAKER_15]: This year, we've had other years where we've had to supplement that budget.

310
00:26:04,647 --> 00:26:06,328
[SPEAKER_15]: It just depends on the claim.

311
00:26:06,368 --> 00:26:08,970
[SPEAKER_15]: So we funded that again this year for the same amount.

312
00:26:09,370 --> 00:26:14,394
[SPEAKER_15]: Even though it was $270,000, we may have, because we only had one small workers' comp claim.

313
00:26:14,454 --> 00:26:17,536
[SPEAKER_15]: Next year we may have five large workers' comp claims.

314
00:26:17,556 --> 00:26:18,857
[SPEAKER_15]: So that changes.

315
00:26:18,897 --> 00:26:19,917
[SPEAKER_15]: So we fund that the same.

316
00:26:20,398 --> 00:26:21,338
[SPEAKER_05]: And I appreciate that.

317
00:26:21,459 --> 00:26:28,403
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know in a $162 million budget, when you're doing line by line, there's going to be some deficits and surpluses.

318
00:26:28,824 --> 00:26:33,707
[SPEAKER_05]: But to arrive at the same million dollar figure every year, that's a concern.

319
00:26:34,337 --> 00:26:35,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been doing this for a lot of years.

320
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:42,786
[SPEAKER_05]: And all I'm asking for the administration, not to move mountains, but to provide another column that shows me to date.

321
00:26:43,167 --> 00:26:50,375
[SPEAKER_05]: So, if we started the budget a week ago, I want to see, as of June 15th, that line item, are we in a deficit or a surplus?

322
00:26:51,188 --> 00:26:52,188
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all we're asking for.

323
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:53,469
[SPEAKER_15]: You can get that at the end of every month.

324
00:26:53,489 --> 00:26:55,350
[SPEAKER_15]: We can give you a report at the end of every month.

325
00:26:55,430 --> 00:26:55,650
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

326
00:26:55,670 --> 00:26:56,990
[SPEAKER_05]: Coulda, woulda, shoulda, woulda, coulda, shoulda.

327
00:26:57,011 --> 00:26:57,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we can do that.

328
00:26:57,631 --> 00:26:57,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right.

329
00:26:57,931 --> 00:26:58,551
[SPEAKER_15]: It never happens.

330
00:26:58,751 --> 00:26:59,091
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, yeah.

331
00:26:59,512 --> 00:26:59,812
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

332
00:26:59,872 --> 00:27:00,032
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

333
00:27:00,612 --> 00:27:04,434
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, so I mean, the health insurance budget this year, we have to supplement it by $500.

334
00:27:05,234 --> 00:27:07,155
[SPEAKER_15]: Last year, we had a surplus in that line.

335
00:27:07,895 --> 00:27:13,938
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's just circumstances based on rate increases and people that change plans.

336
00:27:14,058 --> 00:27:16,479
[SPEAKER_15]: And we don't always have that information of budget time.

337
00:27:16,979 --> 00:27:18,960
[SPEAKER_15]: So we make an allowance to try to

338
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:25,242
[SPEAKER_15]: account for the increase in the budget, and we make an estimate of the budget, and sometimes we come in closer than other times.

339
00:27:26,822 --> 00:27:33,324
[SPEAKER_15]: But we don't change our budget every year based on the fact that this year we had a surplus because next year it could be a deficit.

340
00:27:33,684 --> 00:27:40,086
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't, but any wise person would say if every year you're in a deficit in a particular line item,

341
00:27:40,517 --> 00:27:42,218
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a concern with that particular line item.

342
00:27:42,258 --> 00:27:45,380
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think it is every year we're in a deficit of that particular line item.

343
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Other than the police overtime, which is probably always a deficit.

344
00:27:47,282 --> 00:27:52,446
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know that because every year, all we get is a list saying, OK, we're going to transfer a council.

345
00:27:52,966 --> 00:27:55,708
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the most part, we ask questions, but we transfer.

346
00:27:55,728 --> 00:28:00,831
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you'd like to see a list now of every line item, I can give you that list.

347
00:28:01,832 --> 00:28:06,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's late now because I'm not going to vote for this tonight until we do get a list.

348
00:28:07,656 --> 00:28:09,858
[SPEAKER_05]: And I haven't asked this just recently

349
00:28:10,403 --> 00:28:14,686
[SPEAKER_05]: This is probably the last couple of budget sessions that I've asked.

350
00:28:15,326 --> 00:28:20,570
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were told by the budget director, the former budget director, that that would be included in this year's budget.

351
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:27,935
[SPEAKER_05]: And I realize it was a change in administration, but when you make an agreement, you should follow through.

352
00:28:27,955 --> 00:28:31,257
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said, I saw the documents prepared for you.

353
00:28:31,337 --> 00:28:33,879
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't realize it was not exactly what you were looking for.

354
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:36,621
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't prepare the documents, so I thought it was what you wanted.

355
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:38,474
[SPEAKER_05]: I could show you the document.

356
00:28:38,514 --> 00:28:40,976
[SPEAKER_05]: If you could make heads or tails, that document to the budget.

357
00:28:40,996 --> 00:28:44,619
[SPEAKER_15]: If it wasn't what you wanted, obviously, you know what you wanted and what you didn't.

358
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:46,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

359
00:28:47,021 --> 00:28:47,982
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't suffice.

360
00:28:51,305 --> 00:28:53,647
[SPEAKER_15]: But if you have any questions about any particular line, I mean...

361
00:28:54,770 --> 00:29:01,574
[SPEAKER_15]: Just to go over them briefly, a lot of line items had utilities were in surplus because the oil prices were so low.

362
00:29:01,894 --> 00:29:04,075
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why a lot of those utility lines were over budget.

363
00:29:05,376 --> 00:29:07,878
[SPEAKER_15]: The health department was over budget because the health director left.

364
00:29:09,218 --> 00:29:10,139
[SPEAKER_15]: The library was the same.

365
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,580
[SPEAKER_15]: The library director left, replaced by a lower paid person.

366
00:29:16,663 --> 00:29:20,345
[SPEAKER_15]: My office, the finance department, the procurement director left.

367
00:29:20,365 --> 00:29:21,465
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why there was surplus there.

368
00:29:21,606 --> 00:29:22,986
[SPEAKER_05]: What about the salary for fire?

369
00:29:24,271 --> 00:29:25,973
[SPEAKER_15]: That's probably, I think they're unfilled positions.

370
00:29:26,574 --> 00:29:27,394
[SPEAKER_05]: Unfilled positions.

371
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:27,615
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

372
00:29:27,775 --> 00:29:29,717
[SPEAKER_15]: I got that number right from the fire department.

373
00:29:29,737 --> 00:29:30,998
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think it's, uh, right.

374
00:29:31,259 --> 00:29:32,640
[SPEAKER_05]: So here we go again.

375
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:37,966
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, you know, uh, in a budget process, we say we're going to hire new police, new fire.

376
00:29:37,986 --> 00:29:39,407
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes unfilled.

377
00:29:39,788 --> 00:29:45,694
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the end of the year, without any public fanfare, we take the money that should have been for six firefighters.

378
00:29:46,164 --> 00:29:47,405
[SPEAKER_05]: And we transfer it to overtime.

379
00:29:47,425 --> 00:29:52,408
[SPEAKER_15]: But I think there are extenuating circumstances of why sometimes positions don't get filled.

380
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:54,069
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not the first time.

381
00:29:54,310 --> 00:29:54,670
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I know.

382
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:56,271
[SPEAKER_05]: This happens all the time.

383
00:29:56,291 --> 00:29:57,592
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why I asked in the budget.

384
00:29:57,992 --> 00:30:03,756
[SPEAKER_05]: I said there were a number of vacancies more than the last previous five years in this year's budget.

385
00:30:04,317 --> 00:30:05,397
[SPEAKER_05]: And I asked for a breakdown.

386
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:06,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Why do we have so many vacancies?

387
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:15,144
[SPEAKER_05]: Because in my previous experience with vacancies is if they're not filled, that is also used as a buffer to take that money, transfer it,

388
00:30:15,527 --> 00:30:22,010
[SPEAKER_05]: and use it for one of your other pet projects or something else that you might have funded in the budget that didn't have enough money.

389
00:30:22,331 --> 00:30:26,693
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I think when the budget is prepared and they put in money for vacancies, the intention is to fill them.

390
00:30:27,313 --> 00:30:30,675
[SPEAKER_15]: If it doesn't get done, there's other circumstances that have prevented that.

391
00:30:31,035 --> 00:30:33,376
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't think it's the intention to leave the position unfilled.

392
00:30:35,137 --> 00:30:36,338
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my take on it.

393
00:30:37,478 --> 00:30:38,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

394
00:30:38,339 --> 00:30:39,319
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Counsel Max.

395
00:30:39,359 --> 00:30:40,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Chair recognizes Counsel Falco.

396
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,881
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

397
00:30:42,121 --> 00:30:42,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Ms.

398
00:30:42,521 --> 00:30:43,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Baker, for your report.

399
00:30:44,182 --> 00:30:44,422
[SPEAKER_14]: Right here.

400
00:30:45,072 --> 00:30:45,372
[SPEAKER_11]: OK.

401
00:30:46,133 --> 00:30:47,293
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah.

402
00:30:47,373 --> 00:30:51,796
[SPEAKER_14]: You had mentioned about getting the report on a monthly basis.

403
00:30:51,956 --> 00:30:52,116
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.

404
00:30:52,516 --> 00:30:53,737
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that's what we need.

405
00:30:53,757 --> 00:31:03,082
[SPEAKER_14]: I know when I was in the school committee, that's what I recommended, because there was virtually no budget reporting until we got to the budget time of year, which was in May, June time frame.

406
00:31:03,703 --> 00:31:08,526
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think what we should have here is we should have budget to actuals on a monthly basis.

407
00:31:08,746 --> 00:31:09,866
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes complete sense.

408
00:31:10,267 --> 00:31:14,389
[SPEAKER_14]: We should be monitoring the budget on a monthly basis to see, you know,

409
00:31:15,078 --> 00:31:18,279
[SPEAKER_14]: how things are, you know, unfolding as we progress through the year.

410
00:31:18,819 --> 00:31:20,899
[SPEAKER_14]: The budget process shouldn't be just in June.

411
00:31:21,719 --> 00:31:35,141
[SPEAKER_14]: It should be in a monthly basis where we follow it, each of us, so we can see where is money being spent, how the accounts are being spent down, and, you know, whether or not, you know, we should be allocating things differently in years, next year or the year after that.

412
00:31:35,642 --> 00:31:40,222
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I think I'd like to see budget to actual reporting that we get on a monthly basis.

413
00:31:40,562 --> 00:31:43,903
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it'd be beneficial to all of us to actually keep our eyes on the numbers.

414
00:31:44,404 --> 00:31:50,825
[SPEAKER_14]: and to see which way we're going and to see how we end up at the end of the year when we actually get the budget.

415
00:31:51,065 --> 00:31:51,905
[SPEAKER_15]: It's very easy to do.

416
00:31:52,105 --> 00:31:52,966
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, great.

417
00:31:53,146 --> 00:31:57,146
[SPEAKER_14]: I definitely think it's the way we need to head.

418
00:31:57,446 --> 00:32:00,487
[SPEAKER_14]: The budget process should be a process that we look at every month.

419
00:32:00,647 --> 00:32:04,808
[SPEAKER_14]: It can't be just in that May, June, or sometimes just June time frame.

420
00:32:04,848 --> 00:32:08,788
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we could get that on a monthly basis, I think that's something that we desperately need.

421
00:32:09,008 --> 00:32:09,268
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

422
00:32:09,368 --> 00:32:09,708
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

423
00:32:10,249 --> 00:32:10,609
[SPEAKER_15]: Very easy.

424
00:32:13,288 --> 00:32:14,329
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Falco.

425
00:32:14,369 --> 00:32:15,129
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Caraviello.

426
00:32:15,549 --> 00:32:16,230
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

427
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:18,651
[SPEAKER_19]: And I agree with Councilor Marks.

428
00:32:18,691 --> 00:32:24,415
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, this was something that I've asked for from my first budget over here.

429
00:32:25,096 --> 00:32:33,081
[SPEAKER_19]: And I didn't ask for it this year, because Louise Miller said that the budget would be adjusted to that.

430
00:32:33,181 --> 00:32:35,762
[SPEAKER_19]: But every other year, I've asked for an actual budget.

431
00:32:36,343 --> 00:32:39,084
[SPEAKER_19]: So we know, again, we shouldn't have to be doing this.

432
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:42,847
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, these numbers are, like I said, these numbers are here every year.

433
00:32:43,589 --> 00:32:51,774
[SPEAKER_19]: They should be factored into the budget, so we know they allocate more money at departments that need them, so we don't have to play this game at the end of the year.

434
00:32:52,734 --> 00:32:53,835
[SPEAKER_19]: So I agree with Councilor Falco.

435
00:32:53,855 --> 00:33:01,419
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, we should get something on a monthly basis showing where we're either overspending or underspending, so we know how to react.

436
00:33:01,439 --> 00:33:02,540
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure, I understand.

437
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:03,720
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

438
00:33:06,102 --> 00:33:07,362
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

439
00:33:08,143 --> 00:33:09,343
[SPEAKER_10]: Vice President Longo-Kurt.

440
00:33:09,423 --> 00:33:11,044
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Del La Russo.

441
00:33:13,008 --> 00:33:21,474
[SPEAKER_16]: Miss Auditor, I just want to say that every time we've asked for actuals, you've always provided them to us, and I think that's what you were talking about.

442
00:33:21,854 --> 00:33:26,937
[SPEAKER_16]: We did receive actuals, but it is very hard to make heads or tails of it.

443
00:33:26,977 --> 00:33:33,321
[SPEAKER_16]: It's in probably six font, and then it has original budget, budget adjustment, net activity, reimbursement balance.

444
00:33:33,341 --> 00:33:35,923
[SPEAKER_16]: So it is very hard to comprehend.

445
00:33:36,023 --> 00:33:39,966
[SPEAKER_16]: So I, too, would like to see an actual for 2016.

446
00:33:40,046 --> 00:33:41,447
[SPEAKER_16]: It's great we have the appropriation,

447
00:33:41,963 --> 00:33:51,871
[SPEAKER_16]: the actual for 2015, but in a budget we probably should see, whether it's a monthly basis or at least at the budget time, we should see an actual for 2016, so we know where we're going.

448
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:54,293
[SPEAKER_16]: We even know in advance what transfers will be made.

449
00:33:55,614 --> 00:34:04,781
[SPEAKER_16]: With regards to that, if we could make a motion that we always get our final budget book sometime over the summer, usually in July.

450
00:34:05,182 --> 00:34:07,764
[SPEAKER_16]: In that final budget book, Ms.

451
00:34:07,804 --> 00:34:08,925
[SPEAKER_16]: Clerk, if we could have

452
00:34:10,201 --> 00:34:22,010
[SPEAKER_16]: If we could have in our final budget book the actual for 2016, that would be the close of the year, so then we'll have that one extra column in our budget book come July.

453
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,411
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that will help us for next year.

454
00:34:25,393 --> 00:34:37,562
[SPEAKER_16]: With regards to this, when you do look at the actuals that were provided, I believe five to 10 days ago, if you look at the overtime for the police department, which we're making a transfer either tonight or next week

455
00:34:38,553 --> 00:34:46,698
[SPEAKER_16]: $416,000.

456
00:34:38,573 --> 00:34:46,698
[SPEAKER_16]: That is the biggest deficit that we're seeing on the two, you know, where we're transferring that $1.1 million to.

457
00:34:47,779 --> 00:34:48,659
[SPEAKER_16]: We have that $416,000.

458
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:54,242
[SPEAKER_16]: But on the actuals, it shows that we're actually in a deficit of $606,000.

459
00:34:54,402 --> 00:34:59,986
[SPEAKER_15]: When I request the transfer, we just request it to one of the salary lines.

460
00:35:00,366 --> 00:35:02,507
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's the net of all of their salary lines, $416,000.

461
00:35:04,805 --> 00:35:06,947
[SPEAKER_15]: So if you look at all the salary lines together, that's what it comes with.

462
00:35:07,208 --> 00:35:11,472
[SPEAKER_15]: The overtime was the biggest portion of that, which was $760,000, I believe.

463
00:35:11,892 --> 00:35:14,295
[SPEAKER_15]: But they had surplus in other salary lines.

464
00:35:14,976 --> 00:35:21,222
[SPEAKER_15]: So we only have to cover—your vote is salary and expense when you vote the budget, so we only have to transfer it into salary.

465
00:35:21,242 --> 00:35:25,647
[SPEAKER_15]: And then—so we just voted to show one line salary.

466
00:35:26,054 --> 00:35:29,256
[SPEAKER_15]: So the other couple hundred thousand is being transferred within the department itself?

467
00:35:29,276 --> 00:35:29,936
[SPEAKER_15]: Within the department.

468
00:35:29,956 --> 00:35:33,839
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll make transfers within the department to cover the deficits and take it from where they have surpluses.

469
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:38,162
[SPEAKER_15]: They may have had surplus in court time and other items.

470
00:35:38,182 --> 00:35:38,942
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

471
00:35:39,222 --> 00:35:39,502
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

472
00:35:42,124 --> 00:35:43,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

473
00:35:43,805 --> 00:35:44,386
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

474
00:35:45,486 --> 00:35:46,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

475
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:46,807
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

476
00:35:46,827 --> 00:35:50,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Baker, thank you very much for your work on this budget and for preparing this document.

477
00:35:51,110 --> 00:35:54,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any other accounts other than those listed on this list that are in deficit?

478
00:35:55,211 --> 00:35:56,532
[SPEAKER_15]: No, we have to cover all the deficits.

479
00:35:56,572 --> 00:35:59,793
[SPEAKER_15]: If we don't cover the deficits, we'd be required to raise them on the next tax rate.

480
00:35:59,813 --> 00:36:00,994
[SPEAKER_15]: So these are all the deficits.

481
00:36:01,034 --> 00:36:04,756
[SPEAKER_07]: These are all the accounts that have a deficit.

482
00:36:05,256 --> 00:36:10,899
[SPEAKER_15]: So we had to cover the $1,112,000, and we were fortunate enough to have enough surpluses in other accounts.

483
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:13,140
[SPEAKER_15]: I wasn't sure we were going to have that when we started.

484
00:36:14,041 --> 00:36:16,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any other accounts that have a surplus in them other than these?

485
00:36:16,422 --> 00:36:17,423
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, sure.

486
00:36:17,443 --> 00:36:19,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know offhand what the figure is for that surplus?

487
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:20,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Less than $1.1 million?

488
00:36:23,479 --> 00:36:25,400
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, they have other accounts that have surpluses?

489
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:29,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the total amount of a surplus account minus one, if you'd like us to translate it.

490
00:36:30,842 --> 00:36:32,082
[SPEAKER_15]: There may be some surplus.

491
00:36:32,102 --> 00:36:36,304
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, the overall police budget may be a surplus.

492
00:36:36,344 --> 00:36:39,685
[SPEAKER_15]: The overall operations of police may be in surplus.

493
00:36:40,825 --> 00:36:47,648
[SPEAKER_15]: There may be surplus in some of the DPW divisions that we need to use to cover the deficits.

494
00:36:49,108 --> 00:36:49,428
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

495
00:36:49,448 --> 00:36:51,009
[SPEAKER_15]: Off the top of my head, I don't know which ones.

496
00:36:52,513 --> 00:36:53,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you very much.

497
00:37:12,579 --> 00:37:14,479
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, I apologize.

498
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,099
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

499
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:18,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks?

500
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:18,620
[SPEAKER_05]: If Ms.

501
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Baker is able to get us that information that we requested,

502
00:37:22,353 --> 00:37:29,395
[SPEAKER_05]: I would respectfully ask that we table this until next week, until we get the responses back from the administration.

503
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:41,099
[SPEAKER_05]: My other point is also, Mr. President, these are the ones that the transfers that are coming before us because it's a requirement under the state statute, right?

504
00:37:41,859 --> 00:37:43,340
[SPEAKER_15]: We can't end the year in a deficit, right?

505
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:43,820
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

506
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:46,821
[SPEAKER_15]: Except for snow and ice, we can end the year with snow and ice and a deficit.

507
00:37:48,277 --> 00:37:49,177
[SPEAKER_15]: court judgments we get in.

508
00:37:49,217 --> 00:37:56,000
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, but there are certain accounts within the budget that you can do transfers without coming to the council.

509
00:37:56,460 --> 00:37:59,702
[SPEAKER_15]: I can transfer within operations or within salary.

510
00:38:00,042 --> 00:38:00,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

511
00:38:00,662 --> 00:38:04,984
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're not even seeing the list of other things that may be year after year transferred.

512
00:38:05,724 --> 00:38:09,125
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why it's important to have that actual in there.

513
00:38:09,165 --> 00:38:12,667
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're being presented a list of maybe 15, 20 transfers.

514
00:38:12,987 --> 00:38:15,988
[SPEAKER_05]: There may be another 50 or 60 transfers that are taken.

515
00:38:16,028 --> 00:38:17,089
[SPEAKER_15]: We make transfers all year.

516
00:38:17,549 --> 00:38:17,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

517
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,701
[SPEAKER_05]: And that would be helpful for us to know as a council.

518
00:38:21,381 --> 00:38:21,521
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

519
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:26,103
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the mayor sets the budget and we actually sign off on the budget.

520
00:38:26,524 --> 00:38:28,264
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why this is so important.

521
00:38:28,665 --> 00:38:29,825
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've been sold the bill of goods.

522
00:38:29,845 --> 00:38:31,126
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to see it year after year.

523
00:38:31,146 --> 00:38:39,689
[SPEAKER_05]: And, uh, you know, so I would ask that a motion to table until we get, uh, the budget, uh, call line item column that we asked for with actuals.

524
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:48,093
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, then the, any other, no, if we table it, no questions, go out, go out right there with miss Baker.

525
00:38:49,310 --> 00:38:51,310
[SPEAKER_05]: but she knows what we asked her.

526
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:55,911
[SPEAKER_15]: So if she wants it next week, every department, every department's budget by line item, right?

527
00:38:57,231 --> 00:38:59,952
[SPEAKER_10]: So motion the table on the motion table by Councilor Marks.

528
00:39:00,012 --> 00:39:00,772
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor.

529
00:39:02,112 --> 00:39:11,174
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed.

530
00:39:11,194 --> 00:39:13,494
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-five 66 offered by councilor night.

531
00:39:14,255 --> 00:39:16,555
[SPEAKER_10]: You've resolved the city administration contact the

532
00:39:17,182 --> 00:39:25,127
[SPEAKER_10]: Department of Conservation and Recreation, for the purpose of having a pedestrian crossing sign at the corner of Route 16 and Boston Avenue repaired.

533
00:39:25,508 --> 00:39:26,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

534
00:39:26,909 --> 00:39:29,931
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, this site is actually outside the jurisdiction of our community.

535
00:39:29,991 --> 00:39:34,254
[SPEAKER_09]: However, I believe it does lie on the Somerville and Ireland, I mean the Medford and Arlington line.

536
00:39:34,314 --> 00:39:42,279
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd ask that DCR be stricken from the resolution and we replace that with our state delegation, Representative Garvely and Senator Jalen.

537
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,191
[SPEAKER_10]: On that motion.

538
00:39:53,615 --> 00:39:54,835
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

539
00:39:55,676 --> 00:39:59,118
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

540
00:39:59,138 --> 00:40:00,118
[SPEAKER_10]: Carries.

541
00:40:00,138 --> 00:40:01,299
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-564 offered by Councilor Marks.

542
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:09,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Be resolved that the report of the first special meeting of the Magic City Council held on Saturday, June 18, 2016 at 7 a.m.

543
00:40:09,743 --> 00:40:10,784
[SPEAKER_10]: be approved.

544
00:40:11,344 --> 00:40:13,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor, there's no need to approve a report

545
00:40:14,347 --> 00:40:16,909
[SPEAKER_10]: because they were minutes of the meeting.

546
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,891
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've just received those minutes.

547
00:40:21,033 --> 00:40:22,194
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no committee report.

548
00:40:22,614 --> 00:40:24,936
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a special meeting of the Medford City Council.

549
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:31,541
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you want to have the minutes approved, we've just received them on our desks, I hope, today.

550
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:39,928
[SPEAKER_10]: And so we have actual minutes of the first special meeting of the Medford City Council that are on our desks.

551
00:40:47,832 --> 00:40:48,493
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't offer this.

552
00:40:49,074 --> 00:40:50,575
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who offered this on my behalf.

553
00:40:52,557 --> 00:40:53,198
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't offer this.

554
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:56,160
[SPEAKER_05]: Under suspension?

555
00:40:58,963 --> 00:41:00,645
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't offer anything under suspension.

556
00:41:00,665 --> 00:41:01,606
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

557
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:06,651
[SPEAKER_10]: Receive 16-567-64 to receive and place on file.

558
00:41:11,567 --> 00:41:26,674
[SPEAKER_10]: We do, councilors, have that were received on our desks from the meetings on Saturday and yesterday, records of both of those city council meetings.

559
00:41:27,135 --> 00:41:40,161
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have actual records of the meetings, minutes of the meetings, and then they'll be placed for approval in a subsequent meeting of the Medford City Council.

560
00:41:41,938 --> 00:41:47,981
[SPEAKER_10]: We have one more, Madam Vice President, 16-567 offered by Vice President Lungo-Koehn.

561
00:41:48,401 --> 00:41:56,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Be it resolved that the Metro City Council take a vote to move forward and appeal the decision made by the Metro Board of Appeals on the Locust Street project.

562
00:41:56,065 --> 00:41:58,126
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Vice President, oh, I forgot about that.

563
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,907
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, go ahead.

564
00:42:02,047 --> 00:42:03,848
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President De La Ruzo.

565
00:42:03,868 --> 00:42:07,270
[SPEAKER_16]: I think Councilor Marks was going to offer this as well with regards to

566
00:42:08,633 --> 00:42:09,494
[SPEAKER_16]: meeting yesterday.

567
00:42:09,514 --> 00:42:20,380
[SPEAKER_16]: We did meet in executive session, and then after executive session at our special meeting, we voted to choose an attorney, which was attorney Gavin Cockfield.

568
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,681
[SPEAKER_16]: We voted seven in the affirmative.

569
00:42:23,602 --> 00:42:33,668
[SPEAKER_16]: The mayor did approve $20,000 to be put into the budget with regards to initially hiring that firm that he works for and that attorney.

570
00:42:34,768 --> 00:42:37,610
[SPEAKER_16]: We also voted for point people, which would be

571
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,264
[SPEAKER_16]: President Dello Russo and myself to be in communication and to advise the Council on the steps moving forward.

572
00:42:44,825 --> 00:42:50,328
[SPEAKER_16]: Everything else, I believe, has to stay in executive session, so we really can't comment on, you know, our deliberations.

573
00:42:51,729 --> 00:42:59,515
[SPEAKER_16]: But we do need to take an official vote to actually appeal the ruling of the Board of Appeals, and I'd like to move that forward.

574
00:42:59,635 --> 00:43:03,758
[SPEAKER_16]: I think that's something that's been discussed in length over the last two meetings.

575
00:43:04,758 --> 00:43:07,160
[SPEAKER_16]: I brought it up two weeks ago, and then

576
00:43:08,264 --> 00:43:36,461
[SPEAKER_16]: for it to be discussed and we can allow residents to speak, and then we had a full public meeting last week where we heard testimony for hours, and I think it's very clear how the council feels on that and how the residents, obviously they have to, the residents and the abutters have to file their own appeal, but as far as the council's concerned, I'd like to move forward and take a vote with regards to the city council, the Medford City Council filing an appeal in land court

577
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:43,612
[SPEAKER_16]: against the ruling of the City of Medford Board of Appeals on the decision relating to Locust Street.

578
00:43:44,953 --> 00:43:48,794
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Vice President Longo-Curran, Madam Clerk, please call the roll.

579
00:43:52,295 --> 00:43:52,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

580
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:53,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

581
00:43:55,396 --> 00:43:55,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

582
00:43:55,817 --> 00:43:56,077
Yes.

583
00:44:04,698 --> 00:44:06,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, with a vote of seven in the affirmative, none in the negative.

584
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:07,961
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carried.

585
00:44:08,701 --> 00:44:15,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the street paint at Duggar Park and surrounding streets be discussed.

586
00:44:15,807 --> 00:44:16,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Falco.

587
00:44:17,048 --> 00:44:17,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

588
00:44:17,849 --> 00:44:19,150
[SPEAKER_14]: That's actually street paving.

589
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:20,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Paving, I'm sorry.

590
00:44:20,431 --> 00:44:22,933
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I scribbled it quick, my fault.

591
00:44:23,553 --> 00:44:32,400
[SPEAKER_14]: I received a call last night, or actually a number of calls and messages regarding paving that was done last night in a bottle, actually,

592
00:44:33,439 --> 00:44:37,481
[SPEAKER_14]: They were actually digging up the road over by dug our park last night about 11 o'clock.

593
00:44:38,261 --> 00:44:41,742
[SPEAKER_14]: And it seems rather late to be doing any type of road work.

594
00:44:41,842 --> 00:44:44,403
[SPEAKER_14]: But no one in the neighborhood seemed to know anything about it.

595
00:44:44,423 --> 00:44:59,529
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we could get a report back from the administration as to why the work was being done so late, basically why it's being done, when it's going to be finished, and why the residents did not receive any type of notification regarding

596
00:45:00,882 --> 00:45:01,503
[SPEAKER_14]: the road work.

597
00:45:01,563 --> 00:45:06,147
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, to be doing road work at 11 o'clock at night seems to be unacceptable.

598
00:45:06,427 --> 00:45:14,413
[SPEAKER_14]: So it'd be nice if we could get some answers from the administration or from the Department of Public Works with regard to why that work is being done.

599
00:45:14,754 --> 00:45:17,616
[SPEAKER_10]: I know someone else who was recently serenaded by a jackhammer.

600
00:45:18,977 --> 00:45:21,899
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the motion of Councilor Falco, Councilor Scarpelli.

601
00:45:21,959 --> 00:45:22,160
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

602
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:24,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for bringing that up Councilor Falco.

603
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:28,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I believe I brought this up a few weeks ago with public utilities and doing work

604
00:45:29,311 --> 00:45:41,675
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the questions that I had, if we can, if we could just add to that, the engineering office and Mr. Caron's office, because from what I've been told, it has to go through their office to get approval.

605
00:45:42,375 --> 00:45:58,080
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to know if they are getting approval, because I still haven't heard yet from that original request that who approved that work on a school night at 1030 at night from National Grid.

606
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:58,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

607
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:12,099
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, that we also request a reply from the engineering department and also the director of public works, Karen's office.

608
00:46:12,139 --> 00:46:12,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Correct.

609
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:12,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

610
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:13,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

611
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:15,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes Councilor Caraviello.

612
00:46:17,103 --> 00:46:17,804
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

613
00:46:18,865 --> 00:46:21,407
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the motion of Councilor Falco, all those in favor.

614
00:46:21,952 --> 00:46:25,354
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, motion passes.

615
00:46:27,616 --> 00:46:33,740
[SPEAKER_19]: While we're on to suspension, somebody would like to make a statement.

616
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,581
[SPEAKER_19]: All right.

617
00:46:37,303 --> 00:46:38,824
[SPEAKER_19]: There he is.

618
00:46:38,864 --> 00:46:39,624
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Mr. President.

619
00:46:45,028 --> 00:46:45,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome.

620
00:46:45,508 --> 00:46:47,410
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record.

621
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:51,032
[SPEAKER_00]: John Saldana, 197 Spring Street, Medford.

622
00:46:51,736 --> 00:46:58,198
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm before the city council tonight for myself and the members of the community and taxpayers of the city of Medford.

623
00:46:59,338 --> 00:47:11,821
[SPEAKER_00]: Supposedly, February 15th of 2015, I pick up students at different locations, but somehow never received a ticket parking in Medford Square.

624
00:47:11,841 --> 00:47:14,881
[SPEAKER_00]: I was never given a ticket or never cited.

625
00:47:15,522 --> 00:47:21,303
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a notice today in the mail, 18 months later, that it was overdue.

626
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:23,139
[SPEAKER_00]: on February of 2015.

627
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:26,560
[SPEAKER_00]: This is June of 2016.

628
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:29,061
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

629
00:47:29,281 --> 00:47:32,182
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a scam going on with this parking things here.

630
00:47:32,562 --> 00:47:32,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

631
00:47:33,722 --> 00:47:35,923
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked to see a picture and stuff like that.

632
00:47:36,543 --> 00:47:37,384
[SPEAKER_00]: There was nothing there.

633
00:47:37,584 --> 00:47:42,585
[SPEAKER_00]: I sat in reference square numerous times and watch people pull up, not paying parking.

634
00:47:43,165 --> 00:47:46,006
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys are walking or girls are walking right by cars.

635
00:47:46,826 --> 00:47:47,147
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

636
00:47:47,687 --> 00:47:51,828
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1976 I took every parking meter down in this city.

637
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,361
[SPEAKER_00]: working for the city, okay?

638
00:47:55,041 --> 00:47:56,821
[SPEAKER_00]: Parking meters were gone in 1976.

639
00:47:56,881 --> 00:48:00,903
[SPEAKER_00]: We stored them all down the city yard, and they were gone.

640
00:48:01,683 --> 00:48:09,406
[SPEAKER_00]: A few years later, they built a parking garage, which was deplorable and poorly constructed.

641
00:48:10,426 --> 00:48:12,587
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was the gentleman that went through the parking garage.

642
00:48:13,572 --> 00:48:19,059
[SPEAKER_00]: seriously hurt, hip replacement, hand surgeries, back surgeries, and shoulder surgeries.

643
00:48:19,539 --> 00:48:25,607
[SPEAKER_00]: And never once, any city official except one, Robert Penta, asked me how I was.

644
00:48:26,868 --> 00:48:30,272
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor McGlynn, Paul Gere, nobody ever asked me.

645
00:48:30,993 --> 00:48:32,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything come out of my pocket.

646
00:48:32,334 --> 00:48:37,015
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have sued the city for big money, but I saved the taxpayers a lot of money, okay?

647
00:48:37,035 --> 00:48:39,216
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, but this is what's going on.

648
00:48:39,256 --> 00:48:40,937
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a scam with this parking thing.

649
00:48:41,477 --> 00:48:48,420
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell the people in the city of Medford and outsiders, don't pay these tickets because they got nothing to do with the registry of motor vehicles, okay?

650
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,761
[SPEAKER_00]: I work as a driving instructor.

651
00:48:50,841 --> 00:48:51,901
[SPEAKER_00]: I own a driving school.

652
00:48:52,421 --> 00:48:54,542
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know the laws of the registry and everything.

653
00:48:54,822 --> 00:48:56,383
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out there seven days a week.

654
00:48:57,103 --> 00:49:00,566
[SPEAKER_00]: teaching the youth of this city and other cities, okay?

655
00:49:01,386 --> 00:49:03,488
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a scam that's going on with this parking thing.

656
00:49:03,528 --> 00:49:06,010
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very arrogant today too, okay?

657
00:49:06,650 --> 00:49:12,274
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been down to the police station numerous times complaining about this also, but this is what's going on in this city.

658
00:49:12,955 --> 00:49:23,923
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping some officials are not getting kicked back from this parking garage, I mean parking situation that's going on because it's just a scam.

659
00:49:24,441 --> 00:49:28,004
[SPEAKER_00]: And the senior citizens are getting taken left and right in this city.

660
00:49:28,324 --> 00:49:30,786
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it every single day out there, okay?

661
00:49:31,486 --> 00:49:36,951
[SPEAKER_00]: I just appreciate your time taking me the time to speak tonight, but something's got to be done about this.

662
00:49:37,171 --> 00:49:38,632
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of it, okay?

663
00:49:39,493 --> 00:49:43,035
[SPEAKER_00]: The taxpayers lost three times, all right?

664
00:49:43,135 --> 00:49:44,176
[SPEAKER_00]: Three times they lost.

665
00:49:45,157 --> 00:49:46,698
[SPEAKER_00]: Got rid of the parking meters years ago.

666
00:49:47,619 --> 00:49:49,520
[SPEAKER_00]: You built the garage which had to come down.

667
00:49:50,021 --> 00:49:50,561
[SPEAKER_00]: They built it.

668
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:52,603
[SPEAKER_00]: Taxpayers' money had to come down.

669
00:49:53,736 --> 00:49:57,738
[SPEAKER_00]: And three, now they're doing with these parking meters again, okay?

670
00:49:58,258 --> 00:49:59,439
[SPEAKER_00]: So something has to be done.

671
00:49:59,459 --> 00:50:08,924
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you guys are the city officials, the mayors, there's a new mayor in the city, I don't know if she's gonna do anything about it, but it's a shame what's going on, okay?

672
00:50:09,605 --> 00:50:12,046
[SPEAKER_00]: You people gotta park in the square too from time to time.

673
00:50:12,966 --> 00:50:15,968
[SPEAKER_00]: If the meter runs out, you're gonna get a ticket yourselves, okay?

674
00:50:17,329 --> 00:50:23,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them, they give out tickets left and right, and let me tell you, even judges have to pay their tickets over there, okay?

675
00:50:24,436 --> 00:50:27,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I worked out of the court system for a while, too.

676
00:50:27,597 --> 00:50:31,519
[SPEAKER_00]: And judges asked me to see if I can go straighten tickets out.

677
00:50:31,539 --> 00:50:32,559
[SPEAKER_00]: And I says, you can't do it.

678
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:33,440
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do it.

679
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:35,161
[SPEAKER_00]: They gave me the money I had to pay.

680
00:50:35,181 --> 00:50:35,841
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

681
00:50:35,881 --> 00:50:36,861
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what's going on.

682
00:50:36,901 --> 00:50:43,324
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope this is a wake-up call tonight with this pocket leaders, because it's a deplorable situation.

683
00:50:43,504 --> 00:50:44,124
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

684
00:50:44,144 --> 00:50:44,585
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

685
00:50:44,825 --> 00:50:45,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

686
00:50:47,626 --> 00:50:51,548
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Vice President Lungo-Koehn to return to the regular order of business.

687
00:50:51,608 --> 00:50:52,348
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor?

688
00:50:53,084 --> 00:50:56,325
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed, motion carries.

689
00:50:56,345 --> 00:51:05,389
[SPEAKER_10]: 16-561, petition by Robert C. Cappucci, 71 Evans Street, Medford, Mass., to address the council about Evans Street, et al., repairs.

690
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:08,751
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like you, Yusuf, et al.

691
00:51:09,031 --> 00:51:09,491
[SPEAKER_18]: Very nice.

692
00:51:09,791 --> 00:51:10,832
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

693
00:51:10,952 --> 00:51:12,292
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Robert L. Cappucci.

694
00:51:12,312 --> 00:51:20,456
[SPEAKER_18]: But, Mr. President, if I could, there is another citizen, Mr. Eric Reed, who wants to speak, and it's a similar

695
00:51:21,202 --> 00:51:27,908
[SPEAKER_18]: issue that he wants to speak on, so if he could go first, if I could request that, and then I'll speak after him, if that's possible.

696
00:51:28,788 --> 00:51:32,532
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you're up on the agenda next, and we need to follow the agenda items.

697
00:51:32,832 --> 00:51:33,392
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Mr. President.

698
00:51:33,412 --> 00:51:34,093
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much.

699
00:51:35,774 --> 00:51:37,936
[SPEAKER_16]: Unless somebody will table it and take it off the table.

700
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:44,902
[SPEAKER_18]: President Lungo-Koehn, did you have an alternative?

701
00:51:46,183 --> 00:51:48,445
[SPEAKER_16]: Just if somebody would table it, and then you take it off the table.

702
00:51:50,637 --> 00:51:52,697
[SPEAKER_16]: But, motion to table.

703
00:51:55,758 --> 00:51:56,598
[SPEAKER_16]: All those in favor?

704
00:51:57,098 --> 00:51:58,598
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going on the table and off the table.

705
00:51:59,038 --> 00:51:59,539
[SPEAKER_18]: Off the table.

706
00:51:59,619 --> 00:52:02,779
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Madam President.

707
00:52:02,839 --> 00:52:03,699
[SPEAKER_18]: All those in favor?

708
00:52:03,819 --> 00:52:04,519
[SPEAKER_16]: All those opposed?

709
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:05,560
[SPEAKER_16]: Motion matters, tabled.

710
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:15,521
[SPEAKER_16]: Paper 16-562, petition by Eric Reid, 158 Jerome Street, number one, Medford, Mass., to address the council on his petition on Medford infrastructure.

711
00:52:16,541 --> 00:52:18,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Good evening, everybody, city council.

712
00:52:20,742 --> 00:52:27,547
[SPEAKER_01]: I was wondering if you had received a response from the engineering department regarding our petition.

713
00:52:28,548 --> 00:52:31,069
[SPEAKER_01]: You passed the motion requesting a response.

714
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:32,070
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

715
00:52:32,410 --> 00:52:33,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that right?

716
00:52:33,331 --> 00:52:34,192
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't believe we have, no.

717
00:52:34,212 --> 00:52:34,892
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

718
00:52:35,352 --> 00:52:44,499
[SPEAKER_01]: So a couple of weekends ago, it was mentioned over here, there was a committee of the whole budget hearing, right?

719
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:48,282
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to

720
00:52:51,308 --> 00:52:57,672
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's some salient points made by the head of the engineering department at the meeting.

721
00:52:58,613 --> 00:53:02,515
[SPEAKER_01]: She said, there are no construction projects this summer.

722
00:53:03,796 --> 00:53:09,099
[SPEAKER_01]: Winthrop Street and South Street were bid, but will not be done because the bids came back too high.

723
00:53:09,379 --> 00:53:11,301
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're not going to be done.

724
00:53:13,022 --> 00:53:18,365
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a group of seven streets that are going to be done, but have not been advertised for bid yet.

725
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:25,732
[SPEAKER_01]: The engineering department head will provide city council with a list of seven streets proposed for work.

726
00:53:26,813 --> 00:53:27,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Boston Ave was mentioned.

727
00:53:29,174 --> 00:53:34,416
[SPEAKER_01]: The head of the engineering department informed city council that Gurley will wait because it's not urgent.

728
00:53:36,056 --> 00:53:38,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Pinkerton, Paris have been designed.

729
00:53:38,597 --> 00:53:44,980
[SPEAKER_01]: These streets need gas work and need Chapter 9T funding, but no money is in the budget.

730
00:53:46,501 --> 00:53:49,702
[SPEAKER_01]: And the complete streets program is being developed.

731
00:53:50,607 --> 00:53:56,668
[SPEAKER_01]: So my comments is, amazingly, the first point above says it all.

732
00:53:57,288 --> 00:53:59,989
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no construction projects this summer.

733
00:54:01,949 --> 00:54:06,850
[SPEAKER_01]: The next line mentions Winthrop and South Streets, which were bid but will not be done.

734
00:54:08,190 --> 00:54:16,952
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be interesting to find out the work planned for these streets because streets like Evans are clearly falling apart and will not withstand another winter.

735
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:29,751
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not a small matter as it concerns daily access to essential life services, like getting to work, being able to drink, bathe, and being protected from fires.

736
00:54:32,934 --> 00:54:43,642
[SPEAKER_01]: The third line mentions seven streets that are going to get done, and that a list of these streets will be provided to Brianna by the engineering department.

737
00:54:45,343 --> 00:54:47,525
[SPEAKER_01]: Boston Ave was mentioned,

738
00:54:47,878 --> 00:54:49,900
[SPEAKER_01]: which is curious because it was done last year.

739
00:54:52,522 --> 00:55:00,649
[SPEAKER_01]: And the commitment to do road work contradicts her first statement that there are no construction projects this summer.

740
00:55:04,032 --> 00:55:07,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Gurley and Dwyer and Evans have been waiting for a long time.

741
00:55:09,636 --> 00:55:15,021
[SPEAKER_01]: If they were urgent last year, why are they no longer urgent this year?

742
00:55:18,192 --> 00:55:27,655
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe Paris and Prinkert are the streets being designed by a consultant, which were due for construction in 2014.

743
00:55:29,476 --> 00:55:39,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we are being told the design is finally complete after three years or more of delays, but we don't have Chapter 90 money to fund the construction.

744
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:45,361
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't have Chapter 90 money for Prinkert in Paris,

745
00:55:46,184 --> 00:55:51,486
[SPEAKER_01]: How are we going to do the seven streets to be listed by the engineering for city council?

746
00:55:54,046 --> 00:55:57,387
[SPEAKER_01]: Sidewalks are important, but they're a small fraction of what needs to get done.

747
00:55:57,627 --> 00:56:00,568
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot abandon the big picture for the sake of sidewalks.

748
00:56:01,249 --> 00:56:03,149
[SPEAKER_01]: Sidewalks also need implementation.

749
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:10,111
[SPEAKER_01]: So the answers actually leave more questions.

750
00:56:12,752 --> 00:56:15,613
[SPEAKER_01]: What this actually means is that all the work that I was doing

751
00:56:16,238 --> 00:56:27,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Last summer was stopped, and engineering has spent almost a year to hire somebody full-time, I guess to not work, because they're not planning on doing any constructions this season.

752
00:56:29,129 --> 00:56:30,050
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make any sense.

753
00:56:33,793 --> 00:56:36,615
[SPEAKER_01]: And you are the Councilors to City Hall and the mayor.

754
00:56:37,716 --> 00:56:42,020
[SPEAKER_01]: It's extremely important to get answers now before the season is a total loss.

755
00:56:44,464 --> 00:56:51,570
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't look like engineering has made any preparations for construction yet, in spite of having all winter to do so.

756
00:56:52,390 --> 00:56:56,614
[SPEAKER_01]: The construction season is flying by now and nobody seems to be concerned.

757
00:56:57,355 --> 00:57:04,060
[SPEAKER_01]: We must grapple with this issue and stop sidestepping it if we want good planning and construction from City Hall.

758
00:57:05,681 --> 00:57:09,805
[SPEAKER_01]: Now is the time because another season lost is a travesty to the taxpayers.

759
00:57:10,665 --> 00:57:13,728
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a pretty sad state of affairs, especially for me,

760
00:57:14,637 --> 00:57:17,998
[SPEAKER_01]: because I know we can still get a lot done if we start now.

761
00:57:21,659 --> 00:57:26,080
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I can make a difference, and I've offered to help the situation.

762
00:57:26,821 --> 00:57:32,402
[SPEAKER_01]: I was hired as a temp engineer last summer, and we got a lot of work accomplished.

763
00:57:34,643 --> 00:57:38,084
[SPEAKER_01]: I now had to get much of the essential implementation done.

764
00:57:38,484 --> 00:57:41,845
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm available and willing to work as a private consultant

765
00:57:42,821 --> 00:57:51,026
[SPEAKER_01]: temp work, that is, not permanent employee, on essential engineering tasks.

766
00:57:51,787 --> 00:57:55,729
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no reason we can't get a lot done this summer if we start now.

767
00:57:56,450 --> 00:58:07,817
[SPEAKER_01]: To complain, for my part, gratuitously is one thing, but I have also offered to help engineering work on implementation.

768
00:58:08,697 --> 00:58:11,359
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you read the offer I submitted to the mayor,

769
00:58:12,159 --> 00:58:15,140
[SPEAKER_01]: At no cost to city taxpayers.

770
00:58:16,881 --> 00:58:19,703
[SPEAKER_01]: As a resident and taxpayer, I do care about Medford.

771
00:58:19,903 --> 00:58:21,263
[SPEAKER_01]: My offer is still on the table.

772
00:58:21,323 --> 00:58:25,165
[SPEAKER_01]: If we work as a team, we can make a big difference.

773
00:58:26,906 --> 00:58:29,487
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'd like to let Rob talk.

774
00:58:30,168 --> 00:58:38,191
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want, I can come back after and explain a little bit about my offer and the implementation part of it.

775
00:58:39,752 --> 00:58:40,072
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

776
00:58:40,853 --> 00:58:41,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

777
00:58:44,107 --> 00:58:47,329
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm confused about what's going on.

778
00:58:47,369 --> 00:58:51,571
[SPEAKER_09]: So is papal 16562 now being stopped and papal 16561 being started?

779
00:58:52,052 --> 00:58:53,953
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm confused about what's going on here right now.

780
00:58:54,693 --> 00:58:56,974
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Capucci, are you speaking on Mr. Reid's paper?

781
00:58:57,014 --> 00:58:57,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what?

782
00:58:58,835 --> 00:58:59,776
[SPEAKER_16]: Or you want to bring that?

783
00:58:59,816 --> 00:59:02,598
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm speaking directly to Evans Street.

784
00:59:03,858 --> 00:59:07,721
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so you have your paper that's still, you want removed from the table then?

785
00:59:08,961 --> 00:59:10,702
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, Mr. Reid, if you'd like to finish,

786
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:15,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, you want me to finish the whole thing?

787
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:17,300
[SPEAKER_01]: What I have to say next?

788
00:59:18,481 --> 00:59:19,041
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, please.

789
00:59:19,461 --> 00:59:19,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

790
00:59:20,882 --> 00:59:27,926
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mentioned, you know, I can help engineering work on implementation at no cost to city taxpayers.

791
00:59:29,587 --> 00:59:36,410
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of you, you know, some of you may be under the impression that I was angling for a full-time position at City Hall.

792
00:59:36,870 --> 00:59:39,952
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not my intention at all, and it never has been.

793
00:59:40,632 --> 00:59:41,513
[SPEAKER_01]: What I propose is,

794
00:59:43,703 --> 00:59:59,050
[SPEAKER_01]: I offer to perform engineering services related to planning and construction of water, sewer, drainage, and roadway systems as a private contractor to the city of Medford, as any other of these contractors operate.

795
01:00:01,091 --> 01:00:13,017
[SPEAKER_01]: Hiring me as a private contractor, and I've checked this with the MWRA, hiring me as a private contractor for planning and construction services enables City Hall to build the state funding sources directly

796
01:00:13,424 --> 01:00:14,325
[SPEAKER_01]: for my services.

797
01:00:14,965 --> 01:00:19,648
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a simple matter for me to keep track of the time I spend on different projects.

798
01:00:21,649 --> 01:00:28,194
[SPEAKER_01]: And invoicing is normal operating procedure for all eligible engineering projects.

799
01:00:29,054 --> 01:00:30,295
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not something unique.

800
01:00:32,637 --> 01:00:38,000
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to mention again, the INI budget of $5 million is 75% grant, the Chapter 90 funding

801
01:00:42,971 --> 01:00:54,856
[SPEAKER_01]: is 100% grant and there's a million dollars sitting there waiting for us to propose eligible work to get that funding, Evans Street would be a perfect example.

802
01:00:58,497 --> 01:01:10,122
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I want basically is to get all this work started and have a successful construction season so we don't have streets falling apart.

803
01:01:12,746 --> 01:01:14,568
[SPEAKER_01]: people really being put at risk.

804
01:01:15,348 --> 01:01:16,889
[SPEAKER_01]: And the benefits are clear.

805
01:01:18,771 --> 01:01:21,293
[SPEAKER_01]: I can start working tomorrow if the mayor gives a go ahead.

806
01:01:22,154 --> 01:01:28,779
[SPEAKER_01]: I know what needs to get done and how to do it efficiently with Mark, Mark Shane.

807
01:01:31,662 --> 01:01:35,044
[SPEAKER_01]: The city gets an engineer using state funds.

808
01:01:35,264 --> 01:01:40,529
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was trying to be creative to resolve these things and not impinge on your budget requirements.

809
01:01:42,438 --> 01:01:47,061
[SPEAKER_01]: And I came up with this proposal, which I think is very beneficial to the city.

810
01:01:47,121 --> 01:01:51,384
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not have to make long-term commitments, as I will be part-time.

811
01:01:53,105 --> 01:02:02,172
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get 100% utilization, no downtime, no sitting around without any work to do.

812
01:02:04,573 --> 01:02:07,695
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are all very important, visible tasks.

813
01:02:07,975 --> 01:02:11,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Water, roads, sewer, drainage, they're indispensable for

814
01:02:12,304 --> 01:02:13,725
[SPEAKER_01]: for any municipality.

815
01:02:15,626 --> 01:02:20,028
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor will get good projects completed this season.

816
01:02:22,389 --> 01:02:28,532
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we accomplish what we need to get done, you know, the mayor will be very popular.

817
01:02:28,552 --> 01:02:29,392
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be good for her.

818
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:41,198
[SPEAKER_01]: I also have, I'd like to point out, I have strong connections with the community and I'll be able to bring

819
01:02:41,743 --> 01:02:47,846
[SPEAKER_01]: the mayor a lot of support and goodwill and foster communication and cooperation between the community and City Hall.

820
01:02:50,347 --> 01:03:00,991
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can go on, but at the end I see a lot of good being generated if you accept, you know, this proposal.

821
01:03:01,011 --> 01:03:07,194
[SPEAKER_01]: I would much rather be working hard serving you well than being stuck complaining.

822
01:03:07,214 --> 01:03:10,475
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I have expressed myself clearly

823
01:03:10,865 --> 01:03:22,550
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be an honor for me to serve City Hall loyally in all engineering activities that are needed in Medford at virtually no direct cost to city taxpayers.

824
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:31,974
[SPEAKER_01]: I apologize if I have said anything that may offend anyone and hope you consider my offer positively.

825
01:03:32,654 --> 01:03:36,415
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to meeting with you to discuss what I have presented here.

826
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:38,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

827
01:03:38,636 --> 01:03:39,117
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Eric.

828
01:03:40,652 --> 01:03:41,132
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Knight.

829
01:03:41,892 --> 01:03:47,573
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, Madam President, Mr. Reed, thank you very much for your well thought out comments.

830
01:03:48,594 --> 01:03:58,396
[SPEAKER_09]: However, the fact of the matter is this, Madam President, the Medford City Council isn't the personnel department for Medford City Hall and the Medford City Council is not the procurement office for Medford City Hall.

831
01:03:58,776 --> 01:04:04,257
[SPEAKER_09]: So we don't have the ability, even if we wanted to, to hire an employee in the engineering office, nor would we have the ability to

832
01:04:04,962 --> 01:04:10,764
[SPEAKER_09]: issue an RFP for a contract that's required under the public bid laws in order to get a contract that'll work for the city, Madam President.

833
01:04:11,644 --> 01:04:16,286
[SPEAKER_09]: So as such, I can certainly appreciate where the gentleman's coming from, but it's really a matter that's outside council purview.

834
01:04:16,326 --> 01:04:23,689
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really a matter that the council has no ability to effectuate any change on in terms of our vested powers, Madam President.

835
01:04:23,709 --> 01:04:26,190
[SPEAKER_09]: So as such, I'd move that the matter be received and placed on file.

836
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:28,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I make a statement?

837
01:04:31,632 --> 01:04:32,012
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have

838
01:04:32,847 --> 01:04:35,749
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, city council is basically here to counsel city hall.

839
01:04:36,389 --> 01:04:39,371
[SPEAKER_01]: So you do have the ability to make a recommendation to them.

840
01:04:39,411 --> 01:04:45,434
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you don't have the ability to do the hiring yourself, but that would defeat the purpose of your existence.

841
01:04:45,494 --> 01:04:52,798
[SPEAKER_01]: If you say you have no obligation to make council, that's what I would have to say to that statement.

842
01:04:52,838 --> 01:04:53,178
[SPEAKER_09]: Remark.

843
01:04:53,418 --> 01:04:57,721
[SPEAKER_09]: My rule would be that the Medford city council is the legislative body of the city of Medford.

844
01:04:58,101 --> 01:05:01,583
[SPEAKER_09]: The administration is the executive name and address for the record.

845
01:05:01,807 --> 01:05:05,529
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Robert Penter, I live at Zero Summit Road, former member of the Sarkis party.

846
01:05:05,929 --> 01:05:22,577
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to thank Mr. Reid for coming forward here, because I think he's bringing to the attention of our public the fact that our streets and the needs of our streets, whether they be sidewalks, whether they be curbings, whether they be the underground infrastructure, is in a desperate need of, how can you say, a revisiting.

847
01:05:23,537 --> 01:05:29,620
[SPEAKER_17]: You folks haven't seen this, and not to digress, but I will digress, going back to last year during the campaign, this was a big issue.

848
01:05:30,461 --> 01:05:34,564
[SPEAKER_17]: People in this community are very concerned about their streets, the potholes in their streets.

849
01:05:35,645 --> 01:05:38,427
[SPEAKER_17]: The people are not getting any response back.

850
01:05:38,507 --> 01:05:43,691
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, the city now signs on to this quote, unquote, complete streets program.

851
01:05:44,311 --> 01:05:45,032
[SPEAKER_17]: Do a street.

852
01:05:45,372 --> 01:05:46,273
[SPEAKER_17]: Get a street done.

853
01:05:46,793 --> 01:05:50,236
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't get it to the point that it is right now that people are coming up here.

854
01:05:50,696 --> 01:05:54,219
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know there's going to be another gentleman that's going to come up here and he's going to talk about

855
01:05:54,697 --> 01:05:59,978
[SPEAKER_17]: a street that the city owns that they haven't done that was part of a $14.4 million project.

856
01:06:00,058 --> 01:06:01,519
[SPEAKER_17]: And it just doesn't make any sense.

857
01:06:02,139 --> 01:06:11,621
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, the council has asked, and you, acting president Marks, you would ask for an annual monthly go along to see where the budget's going.

858
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:20,063
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think last year Louise Miller said, she said it twice, right here at this podium, she would have never presented the budget the way it's been, as it's been in the past.

859
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:24,396
[SPEAKER_17]: and she would put your wish list in there, and she would show the cost and where and how it would go.

860
01:06:25,136 --> 01:06:32,659
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I think you folks do have an obligation as city councilors, because I know I accepted it when I sat on that side of the rail, to have monthly meetings.

861
01:06:32,679 --> 01:06:36,501
[SPEAKER_17]: So have meetings with your department heads to find out exactly what's going on.

862
01:06:37,181 --> 01:06:43,223
[SPEAKER_17]: The rumor around this building that the city engineer, she's on a six-month to a one-year review for her job performance.

863
01:06:43,624 --> 01:06:46,925
[SPEAKER_17]: True or false or indifferent, I don't know, but that's the rumor running around the building.

864
01:06:47,779 --> 01:06:50,863
[SPEAKER_17]: But whether it's a rumor or not, the fact of the matter is this.

865
01:06:51,204 --> 01:06:55,730
[SPEAKER_17]: The streets in this city are in desperate need of not only repair, but a review.

866
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:58,634
[SPEAKER_17]: The public works department.

867
01:06:59,216 --> 01:07:05,861
[SPEAKER_17]: Their short chains would help, but at the same time, their direction is not being geared into the purpose of what it's there for.

868
01:07:06,121 --> 01:07:10,644
[SPEAKER_17]: What's the most important thing that's affecting this community right now on a daily basis?

869
01:07:11,365 --> 01:07:15,828
[SPEAKER_17]: All of a sudden, they just got through painting the stripes, the crosswalks and the stripes.

870
01:07:16,428 --> 01:07:17,929
[SPEAKER_17]: School is out and the stripes are done.

871
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:19,851
[SPEAKER_17]: This should have been done when school was in.

872
01:07:20,771 --> 01:07:21,752
[SPEAKER_17]: Prime time of the year.

873
01:07:21,772 --> 01:07:22,953
[SPEAKER_17]: It used to be done twice a year.

874
01:07:22,973 --> 01:07:25,955
[SPEAKER_17]: It used to cost $60,000 a year when Mayor McGlynn was here.

875
01:07:26,215 --> 01:07:27,136
[SPEAKER_17]: Now he's only been out a year.

876
01:07:27,156 --> 01:07:27,516
[SPEAKER_17]: $60,000 a year.

877
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:30,724
[SPEAKER_17]: paint the crosswalks and the stripes, okay?

878
01:07:31,184 --> 01:07:33,268
[SPEAKER_17]: Twice a year, it's a public safety issue, why not?

879
01:07:33,870 --> 01:07:37,016
[SPEAKER_17]: But look at your streets, look at your sidewalks, look at your curbing.

880
01:07:37,757 --> 01:07:40,302
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Reed brought, I think, some excellent points forward.

881
01:07:41,178 --> 01:07:50,841
[SPEAKER_17]: not to sit here and advocate for him to be an employee of the city, but he did work for this city, and he did do a good job, and he did bring these attentions to the engineering department, and we're still talking about him.

882
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:53,582
[SPEAKER_17]: After the fact, still talking about him.

883
01:07:54,102 --> 01:07:57,283
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just symptomatic on how this entire administration operates.

884
01:07:57,864 --> 01:08:05,186
[SPEAKER_17]: After the fact, no public acknowledgement, and this council, you know, I don't know what this mayor thinks of this council, but it's quite obvious.

885
01:08:05,508 --> 01:08:12,034
[SPEAKER_17]: She doesn't have you in high regards at all, because you folks have absolutely no idea as to what's going on outside this building.

886
01:08:12,474 --> 01:08:13,515
[SPEAKER_17]: You do the best you can.

887
01:08:13,755 --> 01:08:14,916
[SPEAKER_17]: You read it in the newspaper.

888
01:08:14,956 --> 01:08:15,977
[SPEAKER_17]: You talk amongst yourselves.

889
01:08:16,963 --> 01:08:21,705
[SPEAKER_17]: But unfortunately, if this city keeps going in the direction it's going, it'll have no direction to go in.

890
01:08:21,745 --> 01:08:23,126
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to be out of control.

891
01:08:23,426 --> 01:08:24,967
[SPEAKER_17]: And it is out of control right now.

892
01:08:25,287 --> 01:08:29,109
[SPEAKER_17]: Locust Street is the best example of telling you what's happening in this community.

893
01:08:29,569 --> 01:08:30,849
[SPEAKER_17]: An out-of-control situation.

894
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:31,950
[SPEAKER_17]: Just think of it.

895
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:35,572
[SPEAKER_17]: You folks had to go hire your own attorney to sue the Board of Appeals.

896
01:08:36,352 --> 01:08:39,355
[SPEAKER_17]: and for which this mayor thought this was a great project here in the city.

897
01:08:39,695 --> 01:08:43,618
[SPEAKER_17]: It's going to add a wonderful new neighborhood and we're excited about it.

898
01:08:44,038 --> 01:08:52,585
[SPEAKER_17]: We are so excited about it, it's going to cost you hundreds and thousands of dollars because now the council is going to sue your board of appeals that your city solicitor has to defend.

899
01:08:52,986 --> 01:09:01,552
[SPEAKER_17]: And the neighbors have to go out and get their lawyer for they have to pay for it because they're not going to get pushed around by city hall who never asked them to be part of it or to be included.

900
01:09:02,393 --> 01:09:03,593
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like a bad street.

901
01:09:04,074 --> 01:09:06,014
[SPEAKER_17]: If you don't fix it, it gets worse.

902
01:09:06,595 --> 01:09:09,155
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, it's the public relations of this administration.

903
01:09:09,496 --> 01:09:13,057
[SPEAKER_17]: It's worse now than it was when it started, and it's not getting any better.

904
01:09:13,097 --> 01:09:24,241
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would hope that this Medford City Council puts its foot down and tells this mayor that before you do anything and go forward, we want to be a part of it, and our city streets, we want to be a part of it.

905
01:09:24,581 --> 01:09:24,941
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

906
01:09:29,582 --> 01:09:31,063
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Penta.

907
01:09:31,903 --> 01:09:35,446
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to recognize Council President, Vice President Lungokur.

908
01:09:36,186 --> 01:09:37,687
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, President Marks.

909
01:09:37,847 --> 01:09:39,688
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to thank Mr. Reed.

910
01:09:39,729 --> 01:09:43,191
[SPEAKER_16]: I believe you were here a few weeks ago, and you gave us a large packet.

911
01:09:43,251 --> 01:09:46,433
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have been able to review that and go through it.

912
01:09:46,553 --> 01:09:50,356
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it's kind of educated me personally.

913
01:09:50,396 --> 01:09:52,377
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know some of my other councils have reviewed it.

914
01:09:52,417 --> 01:09:59,382
[SPEAKER_16]: It's educated me on different problems in the city, different streets that either have been started or went out to bid or have been reviewed.

915
01:09:59,988 --> 01:10:00,969
[SPEAKER_16]: that I was unaware of.

916
01:10:01,069 --> 01:10:05,953
[SPEAKER_16]: So we were able to ask, I think, better questions when we did meet with the engineer a couple weeks ago.

917
01:10:06,593 --> 01:10:14,399
[SPEAKER_16]: I think one of the main things the engineer's office is working on, which I believe is a great initiative and it's something that we should be proud of, is the complete streets.

918
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:23,926
[SPEAKER_16]: But I am extremely concerned with regards to the lack of construction projects or any at all this construction season.

919
01:10:23,966 --> 01:10:25,928
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, you can do construction from

920
01:10:26,542 --> 01:10:31,226
[SPEAKER_16]: April, May, until October, maybe November, if the weather holds up.

921
01:10:31,947 --> 01:10:46,240
[SPEAKER_16]: And when you talk about Dwyer and Gurley, who had, I believe, two water main breaks in the last year, we obviously have some issues there that need to be fixed, but then we get the response that... There's no money.

922
01:10:47,862 --> 01:10:50,564
[SPEAKER_16]: No, that we got the response on Dwyer that it wasn't urgent.

923
01:10:51,693 --> 01:10:53,834
[SPEAKER_16]: And I find an issue with that.

924
01:10:53,974 --> 01:10:58,595
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I was able to question more on Evans, Pinker, and Parris Street.

925
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:01,616
[SPEAKER_16]: I know Councilor Scarpelli had issues with Parris Street.

926
01:11:01,656 --> 01:11:02,476
[SPEAKER_16]: That's where he grew up.

927
01:11:02,596 --> 01:11:04,717
[SPEAKER_16]: So he was questioning on Parris Street.

928
01:11:04,757 --> 01:11:12,479
[SPEAKER_16]: And to have those streets, people know those streets need to, we know those streets need to be redone.

929
01:11:12,519 --> 01:11:15,820
[SPEAKER_16]: And we know they were evaluated multiple years ago.

930
01:11:15,980 --> 01:11:17,561
[SPEAKER_16]: And those construction projects,

931
01:11:18,105 --> 01:11:25,410
[SPEAKER_16]: probably should have been done two, three years ago, and now we're still at a place where they're not going to be done this year, pushing us to 2017.

932
01:11:26,631 --> 01:11:30,753
[SPEAKER_16]: That is, for me and for the residents, extremely, extremely frustrating.

933
01:11:31,033 --> 01:11:43,822
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we need to pass a budget next week, but it's going to be very hard for me to pass a budget after driving down Evans Street maybe two weeks ago after the residents spoke and kind of going down Evans Street nice and slow.

934
01:11:43,882 --> 01:11:45,903
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it is down to the bare bone rock.

935
01:11:46,287 --> 01:11:48,949
[SPEAKER_01]: imagine if snow is on that street and they try to plow it.

936
01:11:49,149 --> 01:11:49,930
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not safe.

937
01:11:50,150 --> 01:11:52,832
[SPEAKER_16]: It's, it's should have been done.

938
01:11:52,892 --> 01:11:55,955
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't, I think it's been 65 years since it's been done.

939
01:11:56,015 --> 01:12:02,159
[SPEAKER_16]: And I believe I got an email from somebody, a resident from Pinkett street today, same type, same type of situation.

940
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:08,784
[SPEAKER_16]: So for construction projects and chapter 90 funding to be available enough, us not to take advantage of it.

941
01:12:09,545 --> 01:12:13,228
[SPEAKER_16]: Number one, we need to spend some more time to get these done.

942
01:12:13,712 --> 01:12:15,773
[SPEAKER_16]: or were understaffed in the engineer's department.

943
01:12:15,833 --> 01:12:23,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what you need is people to get the paperwork ready and run the streets and measure everything up to apply for the eligible funds.

944
01:12:24,155 --> 01:12:30,257
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, and I think that's, in the past years, it's information that I, you know, wasn't privy to even know to ask.

945
01:12:30,397 --> 01:12:41,560
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think it's even, after reading your packet and reading some of the work that has been, you know, has been in the works and needs to be done over the last four or five years, it's very discouraging and it's very upsetting.

946
01:12:42,410 --> 01:12:49,112
[SPEAKER_16]: It's too bad for, you know, I keep telling people when they email me about streets lately, because this is kind of catching on to the residents.

947
01:12:50,012 --> 01:12:53,153
[SPEAKER_16]: Multiple people from Evans Street have now contacted me.

948
01:12:53,173 --> 01:12:54,594
[SPEAKER_16]: I keep saying it's a shame.

949
01:12:54,874 --> 01:12:57,515
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really a shame that we have Chapter 90 funding.

950
01:12:57,815 --> 01:13:02,336
[SPEAKER_16]: We should be putting our own money into construction projects to repave streets.

951
01:13:02,496 --> 01:13:04,877
[SPEAKER_16]: You can't go 65 years without being repaved.

952
01:13:05,177 --> 01:13:07,758
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a safety issue, and it's really unfortunate.

953
01:13:08,142 --> 01:13:19,288
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'd make the suggestion that the mayor, before we meet next week to review the budget, we take a look, she sits down with the engineering department and take a look at the lack of construction jobs this season.

954
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:21,969
[SPEAKER_16]: Because like you said, I think there is still time.

955
01:13:22,149 --> 01:13:24,831
[SPEAKER_16]: We have four or five good months to do construction.

956
01:13:25,211 --> 01:13:37,958
[SPEAKER_16]: There is some time that we can get a few projects underway and try to, we should be working on, if the funding is tough or the personnel isn't there, but we should still be working on multiple streets

957
01:13:38,351 --> 01:13:46,676
[SPEAKER_16]: per construction season, because like water pipes, like sidewalks, we need to put money into our infrastructure.

958
01:13:47,016 --> 01:13:47,576
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to.

959
01:13:47,596 --> 01:13:51,199
[SPEAKER_16]: It's extremely important, and now we're dealing with a safety issue.

960
01:13:51,499 --> 01:13:51,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

961
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:53,900
[SPEAKER_16]: There is.

962
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:58,623
[SPEAKER_16]: The mayor, Councilor Knight, yes.

963
01:13:59,784 --> 01:14:07,268
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm asking for a motion that we ask within the next weeks, we ask the mayor and the engineers department to sit down and discuss

964
01:14:08,189 --> 01:14:25,916
[SPEAKER_16]: projects that should be done this construction season and see if we can get Evans Street, whether Evans, Pinkett, Paris, Dwyer, Gurley, we need to get some of these roads reconstructed, the water mains redone and these roads reconstructed for the benefit of our residents.

965
01:14:27,216 --> 01:14:30,778
[SPEAKER_10]: Your resolution is contradictory to receive and place on file.

966
01:14:32,298 --> 01:14:34,999
[SPEAKER_16]: So I guess we can take a vote on which one people want to vote on.

967
01:14:37,837 --> 01:14:38,958
[SPEAKER_16]: I was at the chair.

968
01:14:39,398 --> 01:14:40,558
[SPEAKER_16]: Nobody had anything to say.

969
01:14:40,658 --> 01:14:44,480
[SPEAKER_16]: I wanted, so that was, Councilor Knight moved to receive in place on file.

970
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:46,841
[SPEAKER_16]: I respectfully ask him to withdraw that.

971
01:14:46,861 --> 01:15:04,328
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think there's any harm in the mayor and the engineer sitting down, and since those answers have come out since our council meeting, it is concerning, and it's something that the mayor needs to talk to engineering about, whether it's lack of staff or funds,

972
01:15:04,835 --> 01:15:10,257
[SPEAKER_16]: If there's Chapter 90 funding to do some streets and sidewalks, we need to push to get that done.

973
01:15:10,678 --> 01:15:11,058
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to.

974
01:15:11,098 --> 01:15:18,801
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think... So what is your motion, Madam Vice President, that the mayor sit down with the city engineer to discuss the construction projects for this coming season?

975
01:15:18,901 --> 01:15:20,562
[SPEAKER_10]: The lack of... To work on... Yes.

976
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:21,622
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's an amendment?

977
01:15:21,682 --> 01:15:25,304
[SPEAKER_10]: You're amending a motion to receive in place on file?

978
01:15:27,585 --> 01:15:28,986
[SPEAKER_16]: However you'd like to put it, yes.

979
01:15:29,646 --> 01:15:29,966
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

980
01:15:30,186 --> 01:15:34,328
[SPEAKER_10]: That is contradictory and cannot be accepted with the main motion.

981
01:15:34,626 --> 01:15:37,327
[SPEAKER_16]: I've asked my colleague to withdraw, then his motion to receive.

982
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:40,089
[SPEAKER_10]: And the colleague has indicated to me that he's unwilling to do so.

983
01:15:40,949 --> 01:15:42,510
[SPEAKER_06]: The paper's a personnel issue, not a procurement issue.

984
01:15:42,590 --> 01:15:45,371
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to do anything as far as the matter before us.

985
01:15:45,531 --> 01:15:46,392
[SPEAKER_11]: Isn't that fine?

986
01:15:46,412 --> 01:15:49,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish that the second motion, Mr. President, is taken.

987
01:15:49,173 --> 01:15:50,514
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to be employed as a contractor.

988
01:15:50,574 --> 01:15:51,894
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything over $10,000 must be subject to public bid law.

989
01:15:51,914 --> 01:15:53,735
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion of Council Marks and Seva.

990
01:15:54,255 --> 01:16:04,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Madam Vice President, we're going to take the second motion, the amendment, into two motions of Madam Vice President.

991
01:16:04,573 --> 01:16:11,935
[SPEAKER_10]: that the mayor consult with the city engineer to review the feasibility of construction projects.

992
01:16:11,955 --> 01:16:13,335
[SPEAKER_10]: So on that motion, all those in favor?

993
01:16:13,375 --> 01:16:16,755
[SPEAKER_16]: On those four, at least on those specific roads too.

994
01:16:17,836 --> 01:16:28,518
[SPEAKER_16]: Evans, Pinkert, Paris, Dwyer, Gurley, if they could especially speak about those five roads and we can try to get at least two projects underway this season.

995
01:16:29,497 --> 01:16:34,458
[SPEAKER_10]: four roads be considered, Evans, Pinkett, Gurley, and Paris.

996
01:16:35,499 --> 01:16:37,059
[SPEAKER_10]: On that motion, all those in favor?

997
01:16:37,079 --> 01:16:37,659
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

998
01:16:37,899 --> 01:16:38,780
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

999
01:16:40,580 --> 01:16:42,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight is in opposition.

1000
01:16:42,621 --> 01:16:43,341
[SPEAKER_10]: The ayes have it.

1001
01:16:43,661 --> 01:16:47,082
[SPEAKER_10]: On the main motion that the paper be received and placed on file, all those in favor?

1002
01:16:47,342 --> 01:16:47,482
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1003
01:16:47,542 --> 01:16:48,322
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1004
01:16:48,342 --> 01:16:50,843
[SPEAKER_10]: The ayes have it.

1005
01:16:50,863 --> 01:16:53,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Marks, Councilor Lungo-Koehn in opposition.

1006
01:16:55,330 --> 01:17:05,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President motion to take paper number one, six, five, six, one from the table on the motion of constantly to take paper 16, five, six, one from the table petition by all those in favor.

1007
01:17:05,936 --> 01:17:06,697
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed.

1008
01:17:06,797 --> 01:17:14,922
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries petition by Robert C Capucci, 71 Evans street method to address the city council and Evans street at Alia regarding repairs.

1009
01:17:18,344 --> 01:17:19,384
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1010
01:17:19,765 --> 01:17:22,927
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, it's actually Robert L Capucci, uh, of 71 Evans street,

1011
01:17:24,111 --> 01:17:37,096
[SPEAKER_18]: if I could just submit this petition that I collected from my fellow neighbors on Evans Street and on the corners of the street as well, Central and Lawrence Street.

1012
01:17:38,837 --> 01:17:48,301
[SPEAKER_18]: Basically, we, the undersigned residents and abutters to Evans Street, demand our water pipes fixed and street repaved as promised by the City of Medford.

1013
01:17:48,801 --> 01:17:52,162
[SPEAKER_18]: I got 50 signatures from fellow residents.

1014
01:17:52,843 --> 01:17:53,303
[SPEAKER_18]: The reason

1015
01:17:53,940 --> 01:17:56,662
[SPEAKER_18]: You folks might have received some emails today from Pinkett Street.

1016
01:17:57,122 --> 01:18:03,868
[SPEAKER_18]: It's because, you know, with time constraints, I couldn't go down that street and get their signatures as well.

1017
01:18:04,148 --> 01:18:09,972
[SPEAKER_18]: But I did go down that street and I put out a flyer with everybody's email and the mayor's as well.

1018
01:18:10,213 --> 01:18:12,414
[SPEAKER_18]: If I could submit that to the city messenger.

1019
01:18:12,615 --> 01:18:18,019
[SPEAKER_18]: Please submit that to the messenger who will submit it to the city clerk and make it part of the public record.

1020
01:18:18,279 --> 01:18:19,860
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, Mr. President.

1021
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:20,561
[SPEAKER_18]: No, thank you.

1022
01:18:20,621 --> 01:18:23,063
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, a couple of weeks ago,

1023
01:18:24,217 --> 01:18:34,680
[SPEAKER_18]: A fellow neighbor of mine, Shauna Smith and I came up, and we discussed this street, and it was, what's the word?

1024
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:46,704
[SPEAKER_18]: It was mutually agreed that Evans Street, I mean, I don't wanna rehash everything that was already said here tonight, but Evans Street is in one of the top five of direly needed repairs.

1025
01:18:47,610 --> 01:18:54,971
[SPEAKER_18]: Council Vice President Lungo-Koehn is exactly right, that this street, I mean, let's put that into perspective.

1026
01:18:54,991 --> 01:18:59,652
[SPEAKER_18]: 65 years it's been since this street has been repaved.

1027
01:19:00,572 --> 01:19:03,353
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, with the water pipes underneath them, who knows if we're drinking lead.

1028
01:19:04,313 --> 01:19:13,995
[SPEAKER_18]: It's way past time, Mr. President, which, you know, we were told that bids would go out, they would be decided on in the best possible.

1029
01:19:14,315 --> 01:19:16,315
[SPEAKER_18]: At this point now, my understanding is that

1030
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:22,819
[SPEAKER_18]: None of these bids were decided on, which brought to me to go out, you know, after being told one thing, to go out and get these signatures.

1031
01:19:23,939 --> 01:19:34,846
[SPEAKER_18]: In relation to other things like, which I'm 100% for, park improvement and bringing things in there, we need to fix what we, I mean, I don't mean to be disrespectful.

1032
01:19:35,466 --> 01:19:45,052
[SPEAKER_18]: I think maybe a tandem project could be done to do it, but, you know, if you go out and you fix the parks, it, quite frankly, it's putting lipstick on a pig, Mr. President.

1033
01:19:47,172 --> 01:19:53,342
[SPEAKER_18]: It's more than just the infrastructure work that needs to be done.

1034
01:19:53,663 --> 01:19:56,427
[SPEAKER_18]: I took my first steps of my life on Evans Street.

1035
01:19:56,888 --> 01:19:58,952
[SPEAKER_18]: We have residents on that street right now.

1036
01:19:59,358 --> 01:20:03,701
[SPEAKER_18]: diagnosed with cancer who will be dead, at least one, within a year.

1037
01:20:03,982 --> 01:20:06,744
[SPEAKER_18]: We need people taking our first and our last steps.

1038
01:20:07,304 --> 01:20:09,506
[SPEAKER_18]: This is our home, Mr. President.

1039
01:20:09,766 --> 01:20:19,353
[SPEAKER_18]: Our excise taxes, our sales taxes, our property taxes, our surcharges on these taxes go towards keeping our home, our lives.

1040
01:20:19,673 --> 01:20:26,919
[SPEAKER_18]: We come home after a hard day of work to see potholes as big as the mouths of an alligator with rocks all over the street.

1041
01:20:27,179 --> 01:20:27,379
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean,

1042
01:20:28,881 --> 01:20:32,149
[SPEAKER_18]: You wonder why that sometimes, you know, people...

1043
01:20:34,019 --> 01:20:49,123
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want to say it's a direct correlation, but it doesn't help when there's an opioid and a drinking problem to come home after a hard day's work and see our existence in total shambles, with streets falling apart and sidewalks falling apart.

1044
01:20:50,224 --> 01:20:50,744
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't help.

1045
01:20:50,784 --> 01:20:52,104
[SPEAKER_18]: These things are related.

1046
01:20:52,384 --> 01:20:57,326
[SPEAKER_18]: Not a direct cause and effect, but it is related.

1047
01:20:58,286 --> 01:21:02,247
[SPEAKER_18]: It's more than just the infrastructure projects that are not being done.

1048
01:21:02,547 --> 01:21:10,452
[SPEAKER_18]: And when we pay all this to actually see government governing over the will of the people, we can't wrap our minds around it.

1049
01:21:10,652 --> 01:21:15,395
[SPEAKER_18]: You should have heard some of the comments I heard coming down the street, my neighbor across the street.

1050
01:21:15,822 --> 01:21:23,226
[SPEAKER_18]: Her SUV two years ago sank in the sewer draining because the street around it fell apart.

1051
01:21:23,647 --> 01:21:25,127
[SPEAKER_18]: And she had to call AAA to get it out.

1052
01:21:25,808 --> 01:21:33,392
[SPEAKER_18]: Mrs. Natola told me a bunch of years back, a whole chasm opened up on Evans Street, and a whole truck fell into it.

1053
01:21:33,732 --> 01:21:34,553
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's another thing.

1054
01:21:34,593 --> 01:21:40,216
[SPEAKER_18]: It's wear and tear on our police vehicles, and our fire engines, and other infrastructure.

1055
01:21:42,377 --> 01:21:47,700
[SPEAKER_18]: plowing trucks and everything else that we're also paying for as taxpayers.

1056
01:21:48,101 --> 01:21:54,124
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, it's at a critical point, and I want to thank this council for bringing it up.

1057
01:21:54,464 --> 01:22:07,872
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to thank Mr. Reed and Mr. Penter, who spoke before, and I hope that something can be done expediently, because we're tired of paying to be told something and then not having it done.

1058
01:22:09,889 --> 01:22:11,069
[SPEAKER_18]: It's beyond comprehension.

1059
01:22:11,610 --> 01:22:13,070
[SPEAKER_18]: It's beyond incompetence.

1060
01:22:13,650 --> 01:22:23,574
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's an affront to people that have lived on these city streets in their whole lifetime.

1061
01:22:24,134 --> 01:22:26,454
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, with kids playing there, with their pets and everything else.

1062
01:22:26,855 --> 01:22:30,696
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, please use the power of this body to

1063
01:22:32,125 --> 01:22:49,617
[SPEAKER_18]: inspire this mayor to do what we all know has to be done, or do something when the budget comes up, to jar the system and make it work for the people that you represent, who voted for you, who put you on this august body, as Mr. Penta likes to say.

1064
01:22:50,237 --> 01:22:54,360
[SPEAKER_18]: I think another member of the community wants to speak.

1065
01:22:54,878 --> 01:23:09,002
[SPEAKER_18]: And I hope that, you know, I get a little passionate, but I'm not speaking up here just for myself, speaking on these for these other 50 people and all around the city of Medford to people who who don't have the time to come out to this podium.

1066
01:23:09,662 --> 01:23:16,864
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm fortunate to have the time, and I'm trying to articulate their passion and, quite frankly, their rage.

1067
01:23:17,504 --> 01:23:18,445
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1068
01:23:19,105 --> 01:23:20,085
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Capucci.

1069
01:23:22,125 --> 01:23:22,605
[SPEAKER_10]: Good evening.

1070
01:23:22,665 --> 01:23:23,025
[SPEAKER_10]: Welcome.

1071
01:23:23,065 --> 01:23:24,726
[SPEAKER_10]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1072
01:23:25,626 --> 01:23:30,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Ray Scafoe, 9 Sunset Ave and also 100 Hicks Ave as a business owner.

1073
01:23:31,467 --> 01:23:33,928
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to kind of read from a prepared statement that I had made.

1074
01:23:34,908 --> 01:23:38,289
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a similar matter basically, but I think it's a little bit more serious.

1075
01:23:40,049 --> 01:23:46,191
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to bring up the hazardous condition of Swan Street as a business and a homeowner of the city.

1076
01:23:46,971 --> 01:23:50,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to report to the city council that last winter,

1077
01:23:51,399 --> 01:24:16,619
[SPEAKER_02]: As I was traveling Swan Street, the main rear spring of my oil truck snapped, and a small section, a small iron section from the spring protruded through the shroud, which was the actual fender of the truck, and came within one quarter of an inch to the tank, which is a 3,000-gallon tank, which was full of home heating oil at that time.

1078
01:24:19,159 --> 01:24:22,241
[SPEAKER_02]: This could have caused a very serious hazardous condition.

1079
01:24:24,382 --> 01:24:29,326
[SPEAKER_02]: There are numerous oil trucks that travel Swan Street throughout the year, especially in the winter months.

1080
01:24:32,548 --> 01:24:36,230
[SPEAKER_02]: The trucks are coming and going from Swan Street constantly.

1081
01:24:36,990 --> 01:24:39,512
[SPEAKER_02]: The street is in dire need to be paved.

1082
01:24:41,593 --> 01:24:48,658
[SPEAKER_02]: With 20 tons of weight and traveling at a slow speed, you're bouncing like a rubber ball.

1083
01:24:50,972 --> 01:25:01,317
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally believe that Swan and James Street were part of that new DPW yard project and it was made to be paved and never got done.

1084
01:25:02,057 --> 01:25:09,321
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm asking the city council to look into this matter before a serious hazardous condition occurs.

1085
01:25:10,482 --> 01:25:18,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you all just should take a ride down Swan Street in your vehicle, five miles an hour, and you'll see how bad you'll bounce, okay?

1086
01:25:19,429 --> 01:25:36,597
[SPEAKER_02]: So instead of just waiting to see what's going to happen and continuous trucks going up and down there, it could be a grave situation where something could happen where we could have a big spillage and then we're in some serious trouble.

1087
01:25:38,097 --> 01:25:38,798
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

1088
01:25:45,188 --> 01:25:45,668
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.

1089
01:25:45,849 --> 01:25:47,510
[SPEAKER_13]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1090
01:25:47,930 --> 01:25:50,873
[SPEAKER_13]: David Chamby, 35 Greenhalgh Street, Medford, Mass.

1091
01:25:53,435 --> 01:25:54,876
[SPEAKER_13]: Didn't want everybody else in the truck.

1092
01:25:55,577 --> 01:25:57,098
[SPEAKER_13]: City streets are falling apart.

1093
01:25:57,698 --> 01:26:03,543
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have the crew, the personnel to maintain them, let alone fix them.

1094
01:26:04,484 --> 01:26:07,246
[SPEAKER_13]: We wanted to fund a bubble for $2 million.

1095
01:26:07,266 --> 01:26:07,827
[SPEAKER_13]: Why not bond?

1096
01:26:14,208 --> 01:26:22,212
[SPEAKER_03]: So Scarpelli, just so you know that it wasn't, it wasn't to be funded by the city of Metro, just so they're so eclectic.

1097
01:26:22,232 --> 01:26:22,912
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't want you.

1098
01:26:23,052 --> 01:26:24,793
[SPEAKER_12]: It wasn't being funded by the city.

1099
01:26:24,813 --> 01:26:25,253
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it wasn't.

1100
01:26:25,433 --> 01:26:30,335
[SPEAKER_12]: Is the an RFP for someone to do RFP for someone to do it.

1101
01:26:30,375 --> 01:26:32,216
[SPEAKER_12]: Who would pick up the bond on that?

1102
01:26:32,556 --> 01:26:33,837
[SPEAKER_12]: They would pay for it.

1103
01:26:36,098 --> 01:26:37,718
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for your point of information.

1104
01:26:38,459 --> 01:26:41,380
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, thank you for the clarification.

1105
01:26:42,310 --> 01:26:45,352
[SPEAKER_13]: But really what I came up here for was to apologize for last week.

1106
01:26:46,613 --> 01:26:52,237
[SPEAKER_13]: My behavior was somewhat nasty, according to some people.

1107
01:26:52,337 --> 01:26:54,519
[SPEAKER_13]: My apologies, Council President.

1108
01:26:54,539 --> 01:26:56,580
[SPEAKER_13]: Some people think I offended you personally.

1109
01:26:57,321 --> 01:27:00,443
[SPEAKER_13]: And I would have apologized to Mr. Rumley had he been here tonight.

1110
01:27:01,284 --> 01:27:03,686
[SPEAKER_13]: But people, we got to start waking up.

1111
01:27:04,838 --> 01:27:06,179
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't forget, you work for us.

1112
01:27:07,060 --> 01:27:07,880
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't work for you.

1113
01:27:08,441 --> 01:27:11,102
[SPEAKER_13]: It seems that way because we're giving you our money.

1114
01:27:11,483 --> 01:27:12,964
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not getting anything in return.

1115
01:27:15,265 --> 01:27:20,569
[SPEAKER_13]: So you were voted on to represent the citizens for a reason.

1116
01:27:21,930 --> 01:27:23,231
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's stop living up to that.

1117
01:27:23,751 --> 01:27:25,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Take care of the citizens first.

1118
01:27:26,533 --> 01:27:29,075
[SPEAKER_13]: And just one big suggestion.

1119
01:27:30,207 --> 01:27:40,229
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the council should take a vote to put a moratorium on building in the Wellington area for new residential units, no matter what their size, until we have a further impact.

1120
01:27:40,249 --> 01:27:45,071
[SPEAKER_13]: Because like I said last week, Riverside and Locust already been sold.

1121
01:27:45,091 --> 01:27:47,091
[SPEAKER_13]: Some of the buildings are already being cleared.

1122
01:27:47,111 --> 01:27:58,294
[SPEAKER_13]: The Locust Street report, I take it from what I read by their traffic consultant, didn't consider

1123
01:27:59,668 --> 01:28:04,331
[SPEAKER_13]: the MGM new traffic study that's going to be required.

1124
01:28:05,011 --> 01:28:06,792
[SPEAKER_13]: They're saying everything's going to remain the same.

1125
01:28:07,552 --> 01:28:11,715
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, 490 units, 720 parking spaces, whatever.

1126
01:28:12,655 --> 01:28:21,200
[SPEAKER_13]: Local street and riverside, another complex of equal size, another 700 and say 20 cars just to keep things, you know, smooth.

1127
01:28:21,220 --> 01:28:23,421
[SPEAKER_13]: Where are you going to put them all?

1128
01:28:23,541 --> 01:28:28,924
[SPEAKER_13]: And don't forget, our schools are basically at capacity, which is a

1129
01:28:29,523 --> 01:28:36,004
[SPEAKER_13]: really good thing, because there's... According to... Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1130
01:28:36,204 --> 01:28:42,526
[SPEAKER_08]: I do believe that statement is contrary to the presentation that was given to us by the school superintendent today, and the schools are not at capacity.

1131
01:28:42,546 --> 01:28:43,846
[SPEAKER_08]: They actually have some room for growth.

1132
01:28:46,447 --> 01:28:53,708
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, that's good, because the superintendent also told you tonight that you had 4,600 public school students.

1133
01:28:53,728 --> 01:28:56,889
[SPEAKER_13]: Did the superintendent also tell you you got more than that?

1134
01:28:58,187 --> 01:29:01,708
[SPEAKER_13]: that many students in the city of Medford that aren't going to public schools?

1135
01:29:02,628 --> 01:29:08,949
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe the question that was asked to the superintendent was how many students are enrolled in Medford high school, fy15, fy16, fy14, fy15.

1136
01:29:08,969 --> 01:29:13,230
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe the superintendent said he doesn't have those figures offhand.

1137
01:29:13,270 --> 01:29:15,051
[SPEAKER_09]: However, it's about flat.

1138
01:29:15,271 --> 01:29:19,732
[SPEAKER_09]: 4,600 is the estimate that I would give, I believe was the answer that he gave to that question, Mr. President.

1139
01:29:19,772 --> 01:29:19,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1140
01:29:20,092 --> 01:29:25,573
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm just telling you under chapter 72, section one, I believe it is.

1141
01:29:26,892 --> 01:29:28,393
[SPEAKER_13]: for the State Department of Education.

1142
01:29:29,053 --> 01:29:42,238
[SPEAKER_13]: City of Medford, as of May 1st, is supposed to send in to the DOE a report on all students living in Medford and where each one of them is going to school.

1143
01:29:44,119 --> 01:29:45,479
[SPEAKER_13]: Point of information, Councilor Knight.

1144
01:29:45,599 --> 01:29:52,302
[SPEAKER_09]: I do believe Councilor Scarpelli, at a subcommittee meeting, asked whether or not the City of Medford School Department was in all aspects of compliance with state law.

1145
01:29:52,342 --> 01:29:55,823
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that the response that the superintendent of schools gave us was yes, the City of Medford

1146
01:29:56,217 --> 01:29:59,879
[SPEAKER_09]: school department is in compliance with all aspects of state law, including reporting requirements.

1147
01:30:00,419 --> 01:30:07,263
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, then maybe you should ask him for that report because technically it is the responsibility of the school committee.

1148
01:30:07,283 --> 01:30:09,785
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd hate to see Mr. Romney have to do it.

1149
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:23,493
[SPEAKER_13]: And what I was trying to get at last week with Mr. Romney is faced a similar situation back in 85 86 where the city solicitor could not represent the police department for a matter.

1150
01:30:26,562 --> 01:30:28,383
[SPEAKER_13]: Court case, well, there's a ruling.

1151
01:30:28,403 --> 01:30:32,344
[SPEAKER_13]: It wasn't directly related to this case, but I brought it up there.

1152
01:30:32,424 --> 01:30:41,568
[SPEAKER_13]: And the city solicitor is responsible to provide legal representation to any and all units of the city of Medford.

1153
01:30:42,208 --> 01:30:50,931
[SPEAKER_13]: If he is in conflict, he must, the city still must provide, city solicitor must still provide alternative representation.

1154
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:51,912
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1155
01:30:52,272 --> 01:30:53,112
[SPEAKER_13]: Have a wonderful night.

1156
01:30:54,352 --> 01:30:54,733
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1157
01:30:54,753 --> 01:30:55,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair awaits motion.

1158
01:30:56,346 --> 01:30:56,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

1159
01:30:57,646 --> 01:31:02,648
[SPEAKER_09]: Ultimately, Mr. President, this paper started out as a matter related to Evans Street and the paving thereof.

1160
01:31:03,448 --> 01:31:09,290
[SPEAKER_09]: And there was some talk that the Evans Street project wasn't going to get done, that it wasn't going to go out to bid, so on and so forth.

1161
01:31:09,970 --> 01:31:16,832
[SPEAKER_09]: So when that information was brought to my attention, I picked up the telephone and I spoke with Mark Shea over in the engineering division.

1162
01:31:16,852 --> 01:31:19,572
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd like to just briefly read an email that he sent back to me.

1163
01:31:20,413 --> 01:31:22,233
[SPEAKER_09]: My question was, Mark, what's going on with Evans Street?

1164
01:31:22,433 --> 01:31:25,294
[SPEAKER_09]: It's my understanding that the project's not going to go forward and the bids have been rejected.

1165
01:31:26,002 --> 01:31:27,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Knight, I'm unaware of that news.

1166
01:31:27,703 --> 01:31:31,564
[SPEAKER_09]: It's my understanding that the contract review is complete and has been approved for award.

1167
01:31:31,624 --> 01:31:34,705
[SPEAKER_09]: The procurement office will be issuing an award letter.

1168
01:31:35,165 --> 01:31:40,527
[SPEAKER_09]: When received, the contractor needs to put together the required paperwork, bonds, insurance, construction schedules, et cetera.

1169
01:31:41,047 --> 01:31:43,528
[SPEAKER_09]: They need to sign the paperwork and return the contract to the city.

1170
01:31:43,568 --> 01:31:47,709
[SPEAKER_09]: And after these requirements are complete, the city will sign the contract, allowing the contractor to start the work.

1171
01:31:48,849 --> 01:31:53,331
[SPEAKER_09]: This project may take more than a couple of weeks, but once you receive the work schedule, we will pass this information along to you.

1172
01:31:54,068 --> 01:31:58,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, if you'd like to review the copies of the contractors' bid sheets, you can pick them up in the procurement office.

1173
01:31:58,091 --> 01:31:59,111
[SPEAKER_09]: They are kept on file there.

1174
01:31:59,171 --> 01:32:02,834
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe four contractors submitted a bid for the Water Works contract.

1175
01:32:03,474 --> 01:32:08,918
[SPEAKER_09]: Signed, Mark Shea, Assistant City Engineer, City Hall, Room 300, 85 George B. Esset Drive, Medford, Mass., Mr. President.

1176
01:32:09,678 --> 01:32:16,302
[SPEAKER_09]: So it appears to me that the process of the reconstruction of the water infrastructure on Evans Street is still undergoing.

1177
01:32:16,863 --> 01:32:22,086
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also apparent to me, Mr. President, based on that correspondence from the engineering department, that there

1178
01:32:22,499 --> 01:32:25,241
[SPEAKER_09]: taking the affirmative steps to make sure that this gets done in fast track.

1179
01:32:25,962 --> 01:32:32,567
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that being said, that was just for the record, Mr. President, so that we could get back to the item that was on topic and to provide the most up-to-date information.

1180
01:32:32,907 --> 01:32:35,929
[SPEAKER_09]: That was an email from Mr. Shea at, oh, about 3.30 this afternoon.

1181
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:40,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Upon receipt of that email, I picked up the telephone and I spoke with Brian Cairns, Mr. President.

1182
01:32:40,873 --> 01:32:47,778
[SPEAKER_09]: And Mr. Cairns also got back to me, and Mr. Cairns' exact words to me were, and I wrote them down because I wanted to be sure I wasn't misquoting him this evening, was,

1183
01:32:54,440 --> 01:32:55,921
[SPEAKER_09]: The water main and service is then repaved.

1184
01:32:55,961 --> 01:32:56,781
[SPEAKER_09]: That is going forward.

1185
01:32:56,841 --> 01:32:58,242
[SPEAKER_09]: Procurement will be issuing an award letter.

1186
01:32:58,482 --> 01:32:59,542
[SPEAKER_09]: Then the contract is signed.

1187
01:32:59,662 --> 01:33:00,443
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all on schedule.

1188
01:33:01,483 --> 01:33:04,524
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's apparent to me, Mr. President, that this matter is going to be moving forward.

1189
01:33:04,884 --> 01:33:08,146
[SPEAKER_09]: It might not be in the schedule that we all would like to see it on, but it is on a schedule.

1190
01:33:08,386 --> 01:33:13,168
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's my hope and my wish and my desire that this gets done before the close of this construction season.

1191
01:33:14,128 --> 01:33:18,310
[SPEAKER_09]: And as such, I will continue to pick up the phone and continue to contact the individuals that are responsible for

1192
01:33:19,183 --> 01:33:22,304
[SPEAKER_09]: ensuring that this project goes out to bid appropriately and the construction work starts.

1193
01:33:22,364 --> 01:33:25,045
[SPEAKER_09]: But I did want to be sure that I shared that with the neighborhood, Mr. President.

1194
01:33:25,766 --> 01:33:26,106
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1195
01:33:26,486 --> 01:33:28,347
[SPEAKER_10]: Chair recognizes Vice President Logan Kern.

1196
01:33:30,148 --> 01:33:30,508
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

1197
01:33:30,528 --> 01:33:31,528
[SPEAKER_16]: That's great news.

1198
01:33:32,108 --> 01:33:40,472
[SPEAKER_16]: I think Cassandra did mention that at our meeting, that it needs full construction after the water main, hopefully getting the water main done this year.

1199
01:33:40,532 --> 01:33:45,734
[SPEAKER_16]: And I believe she said reclaiming it, which I assume is repaving it next year.

1200
01:33:45,834 --> 01:33:48,695
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think that's something that we just keep

1201
01:33:49,011 --> 01:33:51,572
[SPEAKER_16]: keep the residents keep being told the last two years.

1202
01:33:51,772 --> 01:34:05,579
[SPEAKER_16]: So hopefully we are on the right track and I would love to see it get repaved after the water main this construction season rather than next construction season, which is what Cassandra Kudularis, our engineer told us two Saturdays ago.

1203
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:13,683
[SPEAKER_16]: I'd also like to just ask, make a resolve that we ask the mayor's office with regards to Swan Street.

1204
01:34:13,783 --> 01:34:18,465
[SPEAKER_16]: I too believe we, that bond, I thought Swan Street was gonna get

1205
01:34:20,077 --> 01:34:20,637
[SPEAKER_16]: repaved.

1206
01:34:20,677 --> 01:34:27,966
[SPEAKER_16]: If we could get a question to the administration with regards to Swan Street and, you know, if and when that's going to be repaved.

1207
01:34:28,907 --> 01:34:37,897
[SPEAKER_10]: On the motion of Vice President Long and Kern that the letter be sent to the administration and they report back to the Medford City Council on the

1208
01:34:39,113 --> 01:34:42,596
[SPEAKER_10]: the progress towards paving Swan Street.

1209
01:34:43,316 --> 01:34:44,857
[SPEAKER_10]: On that motion, all those in favor?

1210
01:34:45,398 --> 01:34:46,058
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed?

1211
01:34:46,078 --> 01:34:47,219
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion carries.

[SPEAKER_10]: The records of the tabled records of the meeting of May 31st, 2016 will pass to Councilor Knight.

1213
01:34:54,565 --> 01:34:56,286
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Councilor, how do you find those records?

1214
01:34:56,666 --> 01:34:59,508
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, I addressed the clarifications that I needed to be addressed.

1215
01:34:59,528 --> 01:35:01,230
[SPEAKER_06]: I find the records in order and I move for approval.

1216
01:35:01,510 --> 01:35:04,752
[SPEAKER_10]: On motion for approval of those records by Councilor Knight, all those in favor?

1221
01:35:10,942 --> 01:35:12,643
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Councilor, how do we find those records?

1222
01:35:13,364 --> 01:35:14,365
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to table, Mr. President.

1223

[SPEAKER_10]: Huh?

1228
01:35:28,356 --> 01:35:33,420
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, they have to be signed to someone to read on the motion to adjourn by council Scarpelli.

1229
01:35:33,440 --> 01:35:33,981
[SPEAKER_10]: All those in favor.
