00:00:03,138 --> 00:00:05,158

[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Counselor Penta.

[SPEAKER_19]: Paper 15-5-329.

24
00:00:58,763 --> 00:01:04,487
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilors Penta to allow a citizen to speak.

25
00:01:05,968 --> 00:01:06,749
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

26
00:01:07,409 --> 00:01:08,090
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

27
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:10,011
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

28
00:01:10,031 --> 00:01:18,717
[SPEAKER_14]: 15-329, petition by Michelle Casey, 98 Terrace Road, Medford, to address the city council regarding the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

29
00:01:19,117 --> 00:01:23,901
[SPEAKER_14]: Mrs. Casey, please come forward to present yourself to the council.

30
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:25,902
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

31
00:01:26,511 --> 00:01:30,192
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, my name is Michelle Casey and I live at 98 Terrace Road in Medford.

32
00:01:34,454 --> 00:01:38,356
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much for taking the time to letting me speak tonight.

33
00:01:38,616 --> 00:01:43,678
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I was here about a year and a half ago in regards to the noise at the Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

34
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:50,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, I'm sorry to say and report that the noise still continues without any resolution from the hospital.

35
00:01:52,521 --> 00:01:55,262
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, this has been ongoing for almost five years now.

36
00:01:56,292 --> 00:02:03,538
[SPEAKER_15]: The hospital says that they want to be a good neighbor and they want to resolve the problem, but they're not doing anything in regards to helping the situation.

37
00:02:04,318 --> 00:02:07,621
[SPEAKER_15]: They continue to tell me that they're going to continue to monitor the noise.

38
00:02:09,202 --> 00:02:12,404
[SPEAKER_15]: This is, it's a noise that goes on 7 by 24.

39
00:02:13,024 --> 00:02:15,026
[SPEAKER_15]: It wakes my family up in the middle of the night.

40
00:02:15,486 --> 00:02:16,707
[SPEAKER_15]: My home vibrates.

41
00:02:17,908 --> 00:02:20,650
[SPEAKER_15]: It is just a constant noise that we just cannot escape.

42
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:35,725
[SPEAKER_15]: I've spoken with a couple of acoustical engineer firms, and they have told me that in order to measure the noise and figure out what the noise is, they need to come in my home, which I am more than happy to have them come in my home.

43
00:02:36,805 --> 00:02:45,031
[SPEAKER_15]: I do have a quote here that I can give to you, that it would cost $400 for this measurement to be done.

44
00:02:45,671 --> 00:02:51,976
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've asked the hospital if they would pay for this, and they basically have not answered me.

45
00:02:53,358 --> 00:03:04,845
[SPEAKER_15]: I also, back in August of, August 27th of 2014, the Board of Health, the Medford Board of Health, came out and did some noise measurements.

46
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:11,949
[SPEAKER_15]: And in the report, it does say, in fact, that there is a noise, but they can't seem to identify the noise.

47
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:21,955
[SPEAKER_15]: The woman that did this report did work for the hospital for 20 plus years, so I don't know the credibility of this report that, you know,

48
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:26,694
[SPEAKER_15]: She did have a very longstanding relationship with the people at the hospital.

49
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:29,697
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm at a loss.

50
00:03:29,837 --> 00:03:30,738
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know what to do.

51
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:36,683
[SPEAKER_15]: Short of selling my home, which I'm not in a position to do, I love my neighborhood, I need help.

52
00:03:37,044 --> 00:03:43,390
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm pleading and begging for you people to help me get this issue resolved.

53
00:03:44,751 --> 00:03:47,854
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't know if anyone has any questions, but I'm more than happy to answer them.

54
00:03:49,341 --> 00:04:02,171
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know from, if I could just say from the chair, I know Councilor Pente has in the past arranged meetings between the citizens and the hospital and has been quite active in this matter.

55
00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:04,773
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm wondering if he has anything to suggest tonight.

56
00:04:05,934 --> 00:04:18,344
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the concerns that I have after speaking with Mrs. Casey is the fact that she's been constantly wanting to get a communication and a dialogue that would be representative

57
00:04:18,731 --> 00:04:20,512
[SPEAKER_19]: of the hospital's interest in the matter.

58
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:44,388
[SPEAKER_19]: And I believe the e-mails will prove out that at one point in time when the hospital was coming up for a takeover, so to speak, for which Mara Healy, the new Attorney General, did not allow between the Mass General Partners and the Lawrence Memorial, something went askew right after that, even though she was getting some type of correspondence back and forth.

59
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:52,391
[SPEAKER_19]: The bad part about the whole story is the fellow that used to be the president, Mr. Michael Sack, took a walk as soon as the deal didn't go through.

60
00:04:53,031 --> 00:04:55,912
[SPEAKER_19]: And as soon as that deal didn't go through, he was making all kinds of promises.

61
00:04:56,232 --> 00:04:56,993
[SPEAKER_19]: We were going to do this.

62
00:04:57,033 --> 00:04:58,393
[SPEAKER_19]: We were going to investigate it.

63
00:04:58,893 --> 00:05:02,975
[SPEAKER_19]: We will have people come out there, spoken to Mrs. Casey and other neighbors.

64
00:05:02,995 --> 00:05:04,035
[SPEAKER_19]: And she's not the only one.

65
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:06,797
[SPEAKER_19]: There were other letters that were written to the hospital.

66
00:05:07,177 --> 00:05:09,658
[SPEAKER_19]: And now it just seems like it's just gone nowhere.

67
00:05:10,638 --> 00:05:12,299
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, she's a taxpayer.

68
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,979
[SPEAKER_19]: She's a citizen.

69
00:05:13,473 --> 00:05:17,938
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, and unfortunately, however you want to look at it, there is a problem that does exist over there.

70
00:05:18,579 --> 00:05:20,401
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, does it pound 24 hours?

71
00:05:20,882 --> 00:05:21,983
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, seven days a week?

72
00:05:22,123 --> 00:05:32,436
[SPEAKER_19]: No, but when it does come on and when it does happen, it's disturbing, disturbing enough that at times, as a matter of fact, correct me if I'm wrong, you have an email that you received from the hospital that says,

73
00:05:32,843 --> 00:05:35,684
[SPEAKER_19]: you could bring your office up to the hospital and work out of the hospital.

74
00:05:35,924 --> 00:05:36,784
[SPEAKER_15]: I most certainly do.

75
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:41,705
[SPEAKER_19]: So for them to put that in writing and to recognize the fact that the problem exists, it does exist.

76
00:05:42,246 --> 00:05:44,766
[SPEAKER_19]: And with that being said, um, I don't know.

77
00:05:44,786 --> 00:05:48,747
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, Alan McDonald supposedly is the gentleman supposedly in charge.

78
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:49,207
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

79
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:53,889
[SPEAKER_19]: This council hasn't even given me given an update as a result of the merger not taking place.

80
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:57,290
[SPEAKER_19]: Unfortunately, um, what seems to be going on over there.

81
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,370
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, I'll just say this too.

82
00:05:58,873 --> 00:05:59,954
[SPEAKER_19]: as far as the hospital goes.

83
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:04,477
[SPEAKER_19]: Michael Sack did a hell of a job moving everything out of the Lawrence Memorial to the Melrose Wakefield.

84
00:06:04,877 --> 00:06:12,602
[SPEAKER_19]: That hospital is now in such, I don't even know what kind of a state it is in right now, because a lot of people don't even know what's going on at the hospital.

85
00:06:12,982 --> 00:06:17,365
[SPEAKER_19]: We as citizens and as counselors don't even know what the hospital's capable of doing.

86
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:22,008
[SPEAKER_19]: They've reduced their emergency, strike that, they've reduced their intensive care unit.

87
00:06:22,391 --> 00:06:34,698
[SPEAKER_19]: They've reduced a lot of the other programs that they had there, and a lot of it's been shipped over, because that's where Michael Sack was going to go if this deal went through, and he was going to be independently of this whole problem, this situation.

88
00:06:35,338 --> 00:06:39,560
[SPEAKER_19]: She's a resident, she's a taxpayer, and she's been before this council numerous times.

89
00:06:40,301 --> 00:06:44,563
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, the Lawrence Memorial Hospital needs to be, for $400, I mean, this is incredible.

90
00:06:44,963 --> 00:06:51,807
[SPEAKER_19]: They don't want to, they're talking about a multi-million dollar merger, and for $400 to keep the neighborhood and the neighbors at bay, in peace?

91
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:53,219
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, what is it?

92
00:06:53,319 --> 00:06:57,043
[SPEAKER_19]: So, you know, can we force them to do anything?

93
00:06:57,103 --> 00:07:02,449
[SPEAKER_19]: No, we can't, but we're here to defend and protect our taxpayer and she's living it.

94
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:11,259
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would suggest, Mr. President, that we get in touch if it's Alan McDonald, whatever it might be, and hopefully that the council supports the request to spend the $400

95
00:07:12,273 --> 00:07:15,634
[SPEAKER_19]: to have this person of this company come in and do the job.

96
00:07:15,994 --> 00:07:18,994
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, what's $400 when you're talking about hundreds and thousands of dollars?

97
00:07:19,895 --> 00:07:21,515
[SPEAKER_19]: You're talking about a neighborhood.

98
00:07:22,575 --> 00:07:29,777
[SPEAKER_19]: But to say, we're going to give you a room up here, and you can run your business out of our hospital, that to me tells the whole story.

99
00:07:30,277 --> 00:07:31,037
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's it.

100
00:07:31,337 --> 00:07:41,299
[SPEAKER_19]: So I would hope that my colleagues would be supportive of the fact that we would make the request that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital honors the request of the taxpayer citizen, employs

101
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,821
[SPEAKER_19]: pays the $400, and let's just see where we're going with this thing.

102
00:07:44,841 --> 00:07:46,142
[SPEAKER_19]: Because it's obvious, it's a problem.

103
00:07:46,862 --> 00:07:52,004
[SPEAKER_19]: People don't come to this podium if it's not a problem or to receive some kind of recognition.

104
00:07:52,385 --> 00:07:53,225
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a neither-or thing.

105
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:55,506
[SPEAKER_19]: And unfortunately, tonight she's here because it's a problem.

106
00:07:56,026 --> 00:07:56,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Counselor.

107
00:07:56,626 --> 00:08:05,330
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of Counselor Penta, that the Memphis City Council request of Mr. McDonald, president of Hallmark Health.

108
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,251
[SPEAKER_19]: Acting president.

109
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:10,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Acting president at Lawrence Memorial Hospital, that the investment of $400 be made

110
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:13,483
[SPEAKER_14]: through the name of that company.

111
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:14,423
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the name of the company?

112
00:08:14,543 --> 00:08:20,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Acitech in Cambridge do the onsite evaluation of Ms.

113
00:08:20,126 --> 00:08:21,247
[SPEAKER_14]: Casey's home.

114
00:08:22,107 --> 00:08:25,509
[SPEAKER_14]: On that motion, uh, vice president Lugo current.

115
00:08:25,629 --> 00:08:25,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

116
00:08:26,169 --> 00:08:27,050
[SPEAKER_03]: President DelaRusso.

117
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:27,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

118
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,671
[SPEAKER_03]: Casey, if I may ask you, I can't recall.

119
00:08:29,691 --> 00:08:33,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know if it's a generator or what, where the noises is coming from?

120
00:08:33,853 --> 00:08:37,195
[SPEAKER_15]: I I'm suspecting that it's a generator, but I'm not an engineer.

121
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:39,216
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, what I can tell you is that there is,

122
00:08:39,743 --> 00:08:53,014
[SPEAKER_15]: somewhat of a power plant that is up to the, if you're looking at the hospital from my home, to the left of the hospital, and that noise, you know, it is a seven by 24 noise, 365.

123
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:59,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and how many homes, how far up Terrace do you live?

124
00:08:59,779 --> 00:09:00,420
[SPEAKER_03]: How many homes?

125
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:08,186
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm the second home on Terrace, so where my home sits in my, I face the hospital and I face that

126
00:09:08,849 --> 00:09:09,889
[SPEAKER_15]: power plant, if you will.

127
00:09:10,809 --> 00:09:13,750
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to go on record support and Councilor Penta's resolve.

128
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:20,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only do I think they should do the noise study, see if it's in with reasonable limits or if it is actually a breach of your quiet enjoyment.

129
00:09:20,892 --> 00:09:28,373
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should just go further and ask that they resolve that, that issue, whether they fence it in better or create a sound barrier.

130
00:09:28,393 --> 00:09:29,813
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, something needs to be done.

131
00:09:29,854 --> 00:09:31,374
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a residential neighborhood.

132
00:09:31,954 --> 00:09:36,715
[SPEAKER_03]: And it sounds like to be woken up in the middle of the night is not something anybody would enjoy.

133
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:41,681
[SPEAKER_03]: And we did, I remember we asked these questions and we tried to push for this a year and a half ago.

134
00:09:41,701 --> 00:09:48,103
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a shame that the Lawrence Memorial Hospital isn't trying to resolve some of these issues for their neighbors.

135
00:09:49,264 --> 00:09:54,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I think asking you to work from their hospital is just, it's out of line.

136
00:09:54,306 --> 00:09:58,287
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you should be able to work in the quiet of your own home and it should be quiet.

137
00:09:58,548 --> 00:10:03,850
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will support councilors resolve and ask that they, whatever the, if the noise level is,

138
00:10:05,970 --> 00:10:10,713
[SPEAKER_03]: not sufficient for quiet enjoyment, that the hospital does something to remedy the situation.

139
00:10:12,415 --> 00:10:13,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Madam Vice President.

140
00:10:13,835 --> 00:10:14,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Caviello.

141
00:10:14,936 --> 00:10:15,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

142
00:10:16,277 --> 00:10:19,339
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, what was the last time you met with Hallmark?

143
00:10:19,359 --> 00:10:21,341
[SPEAKER_15]: I met with them, um, over the summer.

144
00:10:21,661 --> 00:10:25,083
[SPEAKER_15]: I've requested to meet with them again and with a change of leadership.

145
00:10:25,724 --> 00:10:28,626
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, you know, I'm, I'm the low, low one on the totem pole for them.

146
00:10:29,526 --> 00:10:32,048
[SPEAKER_07]: So you, you, you haven't been in any kind of discussion with them?

147
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:34,089
[SPEAKER_15]: I've had a few emails from them.

148
00:10:34,489 --> 00:10:37,131
[SPEAKER_15]: They did take a walk last summer to my property.

149
00:10:38,111 --> 00:10:44,896
[SPEAKER_15]: It was the president at the time, Alan McDonald, and their director of facilities.

150
00:10:45,376 --> 00:10:46,497
[SPEAKER_15]: They all heard the noise.

151
00:10:46,557 --> 00:10:50,619
[SPEAKER_15]: They all, you know, stood there and agreed with me that there is, in fact, a noise.

152
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,521
[SPEAKER_15]: But again, they just don't want to make the investment to figure out what it is.

153
00:10:54,542 --> 00:11:00,125
[SPEAKER_07]: And our board of health is saying that they agree that there is a noise?

154
00:11:00,592 --> 00:11:07,056
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, in the report that I just handed this gentleman, it does say that there is a noise, they just can't pinpoint what the noise is.

155
00:11:07,637 --> 00:11:18,504
[SPEAKER_15]: I did ask, I've asked the hospital, I've asked the Board of Health, I've asked everyone, come into my home and hear what I hear, you know, experience what I've experienced, and no one has taken me up on that offer.

156
00:11:18,885 --> 00:11:29,512
[SPEAKER_15]: When I talked to the engineering firm, I explained that to them, and they said, well, they have to come in the home to hear the noise, because when you close it off, you can really hear how loud it is.

157
00:11:30,883 --> 00:11:37,027
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, again, I have been so accommodating to the hospital to try and work with them and figure it out.

158
00:11:37,147 --> 00:11:40,489
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, I know all of you are very busy people.

159
00:11:40,509 --> 00:11:41,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Does this noise happen, like, during the daytime?

160
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,451
[SPEAKER_15]: It happens during the day.

161
00:11:43,471 --> 00:11:45,192
[SPEAKER_15]: I do work from home.

162
00:11:45,372 --> 00:11:46,793
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I come by any of the noise one day?

163
00:11:46,893 --> 00:11:47,533
[SPEAKER_15]: You absolutely can.

164
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,134
[SPEAKER_15]: Can I come by tomorrow?

165
00:11:49,154 --> 00:11:54,297
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, actually, tomorrow I am in meetings all day, but I would be more than happy to have you.

166
00:11:54,337 --> 00:11:55,037
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm curious.

167
00:11:55,117 --> 00:11:56,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, absolutely.

168
00:11:56,118 --> 00:11:57,119
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be more than happy to.

169
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,372
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever needs to be done to make it go away, I think should be done.

170
00:12:03,492 --> 00:12:09,116
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, $400 doesn't seem like a large expenditure to see where the noise is actually coming from.

171
00:12:09,817 --> 00:12:12,738
[SPEAKER_15]: And when I talked to the engineering firm, they quoted me $800.

172
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:17,962
[SPEAKER_15]: But when I explained the situation, they said that they would reduce the rate because they felt so bad for me.

173
00:12:17,982 --> 00:12:19,583
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's why they came up with that.

174
00:12:19,623 --> 00:12:21,944
[SPEAKER_07]: If you call me on Thursday, I'd like to come by on Thursday and hear the noise myself.

175
00:12:21,964 --> 00:12:22,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

176
00:12:22,445 --> 00:12:23,866
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd be more than happy to have you at my home.

177
00:12:23,886 --> 00:12:23,926
[SPEAKER_15]: OK.

178
00:12:24,206 --> 00:12:24,426
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

179
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:25,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

180
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:25,887
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

181
00:12:26,452 --> 00:12:27,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

182
00:12:27,433 --> 00:12:28,654
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, thank you very much.

183
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:31,956
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think, uh, Councilor Caviello and I are on the same page with this.

184
00:12:32,476 --> 00:12:34,938
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, I certainly appreciate, uh, Ms.

185
00:12:34,978 --> 00:12:41,263
[SPEAKER_10]: Casey going through the trouble of having to actually invite people into their, her home to get this problem resolved.

186
00:12:41,923 --> 00:12:44,826
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I think that it might make sense instead of having Ms.

187
00:12:44,866 --> 00:12:52,131
[SPEAKER_10]: Casey have to open her home to multiple people who want to go there on multiple days or multiple times to see exactly what's going on for themselves, that maybe,

188
00:12:52,895 --> 00:13:07,421
[SPEAKER_10]: We have an on-site meeting with Alan McDonald, our code enforcement officer in the Board of Health, as well as the Council, to see it for ourselves, to all be there in the same room at the same time, so that none of us can say, we didn't hear it, we did hear it, we weren't there at the time when it was going on, that we all experienced it ourselves.

189
00:13:07,501 --> 00:13:10,863
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think we'll all have a better understanding as to what's going on, what Ms.

190
00:13:10,903 --> 00:13:13,724
[SPEAKER_10]: Casey has to deal with, and what course of action we need to take.

191
00:13:14,144 --> 00:13:18,066
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, the Lawrence Memorial Hospital, if they continue to go back and forth with Ms.

192
00:13:18,106 --> 00:13:21,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Casey on this topic for over a year and a half, but not be willing to invest $400,

193
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,596
[SPEAKER_10]: But they probably spent $5,000 worth of manpower just responding to her inquiries.

194
00:13:26,616 --> 00:13:27,737
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't make much sense to me.

195
00:13:28,357 --> 00:13:32,539
[SPEAKER_10]: I think if they're really committed to addressing the problem that they will pony up the money.

196
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:38,301
[SPEAKER_10]: I certainly have concerns as to whether or not the council's in a position to tell them to do such.

197
00:13:39,341 --> 00:13:42,422
[SPEAKER_10]: However, I think it'll be really beneficial to everybody.

198
00:13:43,142 --> 00:13:44,023
[SPEAKER_10]: We've heard it once before.

199
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,563
[SPEAKER_10]: We've given them a year to resolve the issue.

200
00:13:45,583 --> 00:13:46,643
[SPEAKER_10]: They haven't resolved the issue.

201
00:13:46,663 --> 00:13:48,044
[SPEAKER_10]: Mrs. Casey's been more than patient.

202
00:13:48,922 --> 00:13:59,526
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's time that we take a little field trip, Mr. President, maybe, and bring some members of our administration and members of the hospital down there to exactly see what's going on, and then we can have a real informed discussion about it right there on site.

203
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:00,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

204
00:14:00,627 --> 00:14:04,688
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of Councilor Pinter, as amended by Councilor Knight, Councilor Marks.

205
00:14:05,248 --> 00:14:06,189
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

206
00:14:07,109 --> 00:14:08,209
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree with all the comments.

207
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:13,872
[SPEAKER_16]: However, I think at this point, because it has been going on for so long, I think Ms.

208
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:17,633
[SPEAKER_16]: Casey, as well as Alan McDonald, the acting president of the hospital,

209
00:14:18,348 --> 00:14:24,449
[SPEAKER_16]: both have come to a mutual agreement that the noise is coming from Lawrence Memorial Hospital.

210
00:14:24,969 --> 00:14:26,629
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I don't think anyone's disputing that.

211
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:33,891
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think my opinion would be to have the acting president come before the council.

212
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:47,673
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, you could do a site review and all you want, but I think we're better off having Mr. McDonald come before us, requesting at that point, because when he was before us not too long ago, I don't think we knew about the $400 study and so forth.

213
00:14:48,101 --> 00:15:00,453
[SPEAKER_16]: and now to present it to him saying this is what we want, this will be the first step, even though you've been dealing with this for a long time, this will be the first step in trying to figure out what the cause of the root cause is.

214
00:15:00,993 --> 00:15:05,818
[SPEAKER_16]: Originally, I thought there was some concern about the silo that is actually probably closer to your home.

215
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:09,867
[SPEAKER_16]: the giant silo out there, and that's not emitting any type of noise.

216
00:15:09,887 --> 00:15:10,947
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that correct?

217
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:14,648
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, I'm not an engineer, so I really can't, I don't believe so.

218
00:15:15,168 --> 00:15:21,270
[SPEAKER_15]: I really believe that it's the tower that is up on the hill to the side of the hospital.

219
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,830
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be my professional opinion.

220
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:25,350
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

221
00:15:26,571 --> 00:15:32,032
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is not rocket science to figure out where this noise is coming from.

222
00:15:32,712 --> 00:15:35,833
[SPEAKER_16]: And I know Lawrence Memorial Hospital's very busy,

223
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:41,303
[SPEAKER_16]: with possible merger and so forth, and they have a lot going on on their plate.

224
00:15:41,683 --> 00:16:05,495
[SPEAKER_16]: However, this has been going on far too long, and if we invite Mr. McDonald up here and get no answers, I think then it's incumbent upon this city, including the administration, the mayor, to get on the phone and see what he can do with his department heads to leverage some issues with the hospital themselves.

225
00:16:06,443 --> 00:16:11,367
[SPEAKER_16]: So that would be my recommendation, Mr. President, that we invite the President up here.

226
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:12,168
[SPEAKER_16]: We could do it.

227
00:16:12,248 --> 00:16:13,189
[SPEAKER_16]: I agree with the walkthrough.

228
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:15,451
[SPEAKER_16]: If members want to do a walkthrough, that's fine.

229
00:16:15,491 --> 00:16:17,432
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think the walkthrough has been done.

230
00:16:17,452 --> 00:16:21,696
[SPEAKER_16]: It seems to have not accomplished any answers.

231
00:16:22,256 --> 00:16:33,005
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think at this point, having Mr. McDonald come before us publicly will help the situation.

232
00:16:33,706 --> 00:16:35,427
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would move that, Mr. President.

233
00:16:39,393 --> 00:16:45,395
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councillor Penter as amended by Councillors Knight and Marks, Councillor Camuso.

234
00:16:45,735 --> 00:16:46,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

235
00:16:46,595 --> 00:16:48,816
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you, Michelle, for coming down here again.

236
00:16:50,697 --> 00:16:53,738
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it the boiler room tower that you're referring to?

237
00:16:53,758 --> 00:16:54,598
[SPEAKER_15]: I believe so, yes.

238
00:16:54,738 --> 00:16:54,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

239
00:16:54,898 --> 00:16:56,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the smokestack that's out there?

240
00:16:56,379 --> 00:16:57,039
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

241
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:57,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

242
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Just so we're in the area, we can pay attention a little bit more to the exact area.

243
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:06,802
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just assume that the issue was resolved as I believe some of my colleagues.

244
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:08,423
[SPEAKER_05]: So I certainly support

245
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:13,641
[SPEAKER_05]: support the $400 piece, as well as the few amendments that were put forth this evening.

246
00:17:14,282 --> 00:17:19,343
[SPEAKER_05]: So hopefully we'll get some solution for our neighbours.

247
00:17:20,443 --> 00:17:22,764
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councillor Caruso.

248
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:26,505
[SPEAKER_14]: So do you wish to say anything else, ma'am?

249
00:17:26,745 --> 00:17:31,287
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but I just want to thank you all very much for your time and for helping me resolve this issue.

250
00:17:31,547 --> 00:17:31,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

251
00:17:31,907 --> 00:17:35,928
[SPEAKER_14]: So before we take our vote, we're going to invite one more citizen who wishes to speak.

252
00:17:36,528 --> 00:17:38,489
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

253
00:17:41,056 --> 00:17:42,096
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

254
00:17:42,216 --> 00:17:44,857
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm Bob Capucci, 71 Evans Street.

255
00:17:45,218 --> 00:17:46,238
[SPEAKER_17]: Just two quick points.

256
00:17:46,318 --> 00:17:48,659
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilor Pinto brought up this merger.

257
00:17:48,699 --> 00:17:49,839
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not going to happen.

258
00:17:50,500 --> 00:18:09,587
[SPEAKER_17]: I work in the medical device industry, and the company which I'm employed, to be quite honest with you, I don't really recall who said this, but we watched that merger with keen interest, and I'm hearing reports that that merger is being blocked on the South Shore.

259
00:18:10,081 --> 00:18:11,782
[SPEAKER_17]: And it might actually go through up here.

260
00:18:12,123 --> 00:18:13,664
[SPEAKER_17]: That merger might still go through.

261
00:18:14,024 --> 00:18:27,394
[SPEAKER_17]: So if that President, Mr. McDonald, comes up here through your governmental contacts, I would find out that I'm getting reports in the industry I work in that that merger might still go through up here on the North Shore.

262
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:38,202
[SPEAKER_17]: And on the point of the noise issue, whatever resolve that happens, I mean, for her benefit and her neighbors, too, no doubt, please do

263
00:18:38,864 --> 00:18:42,107
[SPEAKER_17]: whatever resolve happens, make sure the noise is contained.

264
00:18:42,407 --> 00:18:54,879
[SPEAKER_17]: And I say that because these sound barriers that are up here on Route 93, what they're actually doing is it's blocking the sound on this side, but it's catapulting the sound in that direction.

265
00:18:55,437 --> 00:19:05,020
[SPEAKER_17]: And as far as Garfield street, up Salem street, the noises from the highway are a big problem from the residents down there.

266
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,321
[SPEAKER_17]: I have a lot of friends that live in that area and they said that to me.

267
00:19:08,361 --> 00:19:11,543
[SPEAKER_17]: So please make sure that the noise is actually contained.

268
00:19:11,563 --> 00:19:12,423
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for your time.

269
00:19:12,603 --> 00:19:13,083
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

270
00:19:13,163 --> 00:19:15,824
[SPEAKER_14]: And on the motion of Councillor Penter as amended by Councillors

271
00:19:16,318 --> 00:19:17,519
[SPEAKER_14]: A night in marks.

272
00:19:17,559 --> 00:19:18,440
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

273
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,781
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

274
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:21,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion carries.

275
00:19:23,403 --> 00:19:25,365
[SPEAKER_14]: While we're on to suspension, Councilor Caravaglio.

276
00:19:25,665 --> 00:19:30,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, if we could take issue number 15-031.

277
00:19:30,849 --> 00:19:40,016
[SPEAKER_14]: From unfinished business, 15-031, offered by Councilor Caravaglio, originally a discussion of 56 Boynton Road problem.

278
00:19:40,496 --> 00:19:40,956
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor.

279
00:19:41,176 --> 00:19:41,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

280
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:43,678
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if many people know, but

281
00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:53,612
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a house 56 Boynton Road that's been abandoned now for a couple of years that's stuck in probate with the Commonwealth.

282
00:19:53,652 --> 00:20:00,755
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's been a problem for the neighbors with rodents and other things like that.

283
00:20:01,315 --> 00:20:05,437
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have one of the neighbors here who would like to speak on it this evening.

284
00:20:05,917 --> 00:20:08,178
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think I'd rather have them speak on it.

285
00:20:09,078 --> 00:20:13,140
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a petition, there's some pictures that the neighbor has brought with him.

286
00:20:14,515 --> 00:20:18,298
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think the neighbors speaking on it will be a lot better than me.

287
00:20:18,999 --> 00:20:19,359
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

288
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:21,701
[SPEAKER_20]: Sir, please state your name and address for the record.

289
00:20:21,941 --> 00:20:22,261
[SPEAKER_20]: Certainly.

290
00:20:22,301 --> 00:20:23,462
[SPEAKER_20]: The name is Mark Crowley.

291
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,544
[SPEAKER_20]: The address is 59 Boynton Road.

292
00:20:26,285 --> 00:20:33,031
[SPEAKER_20]: And I do want to thank the council for their time this evening and thank Councillor Calviello for the opportunity to get this on the agenda.

293
00:20:33,952 --> 00:20:37,275
[SPEAKER_20]: Mother Nature hasn't cooperated with us when we originally tried to get this on the agenda,

294
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:42,318
[SPEAKER_20]: month ago it seemed like there was a storm every weekend that things got canceled so fortunately now we're back up here.

295
00:20:44,018 --> 00:20:46,260
[SPEAKER_20]: So as I mentioned, I live on Boynton Road.

296
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,622
[SPEAKER_20]: My neighbors and I, we're just up the block from the library as well as St.

297
00:20:50,662 --> 00:20:51,282
[SPEAKER_20]: Joseph's Church.

298
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:55,344
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a quiet residential street with very close-knit families.

299
00:20:56,185 --> 00:21:04,169
[SPEAKER_20]: Unfortunately on the street, as Councilor Caraballo alluded to, there is a vacant house which was declared quote dangerous and unsafe by the Medford Building Department more than two years ago.

300
00:21:05,381 --> 00:21:12,423
[SPEAKER_20]: The resident of the home and son of the original owners, Mr. James Bagnullo, excuse me, Joseph Bagnullo, passed away in December of 2012.

301
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:18,624
[SPEAKER_20]: An inspection at that time by the Medford Building Department resulted in the condemnation of the home.

302
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:28,566
[SPEAKER_20]: The presumed heir to the home is Mr. Bagnullo's sister, Norma, though after two years, that is, again, Councilor Kellery, I'll refer to, probate status is still incomplete.

303
00:21:29,366 --> 00:21:34,607
[SPEAKER_20]: For many years prior to Mr. Bagnullo's death, the house was in deplorable condition, as you'll see some of those photos there.

304
00:21:35,272 --> 00:21:43,795
[SPEAKER_20]: At the time of his death, Mr. Bagnulli had himself abandoned living in the first and second floors, sheltering himself in the basement as the upper stories had already become unsafe even for him.

305
00:21:44,855 --> 00:21:55,199
[SPEAKER_20]: Current and former neighbors did our best to look out for him and his mother for years, decades in some cases, checking him periodically, bringing him food, caring for the dog, raking leaves, shoveling snow.

306
00:21:55,959 --> 00:22:00,561
[SPEAKER_20]: However, in the two years since Mr. Bagnulli's death, the property has been vacant and fallen into further disrepair.

307
00:22:01,221 --> 00:22:04,362
[SPEAKER_20]: As you'll see in these photos that I provided, the property is completely overgrown.

308
00:22:04,818 --> 00:22:06,419
[SPEAKER_20]: and quite literally falling apart.

309
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,943
[SPEAKER_20]: Sections of the roof have collapsed, leaving the interior open to the elements.

310
00:22:10,643 --> 00:22:17,149
[SPEAKER_20]: Vermin are frequently seen entering and exiting, including coyote, red fox, possum, raccoons, snakes, mice.

311
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:28,138
[SPEAKER_20]: A rusted car, one of three actually sitting in the yard, continues to sit there, sunk into the ground, certainly presents an environmental contamination threat.

312
00:22:29,219 --> 00:22:32,542
[SPEAKER_20]: Simply put, this is not an acceptable situation in a residential neighborhood.

313
00:22:33,990 --> 00:22:35,290
[SPEAKER_20]: certainly not a residential neighborhood.

314
00:22:35,951 --> 00:22:38,252
[SPEAKER_20]: This is a street with more than a dozen young children living on it.

315
00:22:38,572 --> 00:22:38,732
[SPEAKER_20]: St.

316
00:22:38,772 --> 00:22:41,593
[SPEAKER_20]: Joseph's School is just down the block, and students walk by it every day.

317
00:22:42,634 --> 00:22:47,997
[SPEAKER_20]: Not only is the structure unsafe, open to the elements, and easily compromised, but the trees and yards have not been kept up.

318
00:22:48,477 --> 00:22:53,139
[SPEAKER_20]: Large dying trees and deep voids in the walkways leading up to the doorways are poised to create additional hazards.

319
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:58,542
[SPEAKER_20]: As property owners and taxpayers, the residents of our neighborhood should not be subjected to this hazard.

320
00:22:59,082 --> 00:23:02,604
[SPEAKER_20]: Heaven forbid any of us try to sell our homes and try explaining that to a prospective buyer.

321
00:23:03,595 --> 00:23:10,336
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, that being said, not seeing any action on the property from the owners in September of last year, I had reached out to the Medford Health and Building Departments.

322
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,877
[SPEAKER_20]: Both indicated there was nothing that they could do, that it was going through probate.

323
00:23:15,717 --> 00:23:21,438
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, the Building Department assured us that the property is, and I use their quotes, secured and posted to prevent unauthorized entry.

324
00:23:22,118 --> 00:23:25,899
[SPEAKER_20]: I think you've seen the photos, and that certainly does not look like a secure property.

325
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:30,360
[SPEAKER_20]: And by secure, the Building Department, they put a small padlock on one of the three doors.

326
00:23:31,534 --> 00:23:37,539
[SPEAKER_20]: Frankly, any of those doors can be taken down with a strong breeze and rodents really can't read signs, so they tend to go in one way or the other.

327
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:42,702
[SPEAKER_20]: Furthermore, as a vacant property, there is no posting with emergency contact information.

328
00:23:42,942 --> 00:23:49,407
[SPEAKER_20]: Medford's vacant and foreclosing property regulations require that all these vacant properties be registered with the city.

329
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:53,309
[SPEAKER_20]: Name and 24-hour contact information of owners are supposed to be posted.

330
00:23:54,090 --> 00:23:58,313
[SPEAKER_20]: That ordinance also requires that same individual to inspect and maintain the property on a monthly basis.

331
00:23:59,086 --> 00:24:01,107
[SPEAKER_20]: Needless to say, there is no contact information.

332
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:03,007
[SPEAKER_20]: We've never seen monthly inspections.

333
00:24:03,587 --> 00:24:08,249
[SPEAKER_20]: With all the historic snowfall that we've seen in the past month or so, never once did anyone ever come by.

334
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:11,169
[SPEAKER_20]: It continued to be up to the onus of the neighbors to take care of this property.

335
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:21,112
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, there has been a recent development where the attorney representing the likely heir of the property, a gentleman by the name of John Cervone, visited the property back in late January.

336
00:24:21,852 --> 00:24:23,493
[SPEAKER_20]: I was at that visit, along with some of our neighbors.

337
00:24:24,148 --> 00:24:30,993
[SPEAKER_20]: And we asked about their plans for the home, both near and long-term, and he assured us that they planned to rehab the property.

338
00:24:31,714 --> 00:24:38,839
[SPEAKER_20]: I watched a little bit of HDTV, and I'm not a contractor, but I assure you, I don't think you can rehab that property.

339
00:24:39,999 --> 00:24:43,402
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, we further pressed him about his immediate plans to address the safety concerns.

340
00:24:43,462 --> 00:24:46,444
[SPEAKER_20]: We asked about snow removal, clearing the trees, et cetera.

341
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:49,546
[SPEAKER_20]: His response was, quote, we'll look into it.

342
00:24:52,162 --> 00:24:54,223
[SPEAKER_20]: not too impressed by the need to act.

343
00:24:54,424 --> 00:24:59,307
[SPEAKER_20]: We actually commented about the rodents and vermin, and he said, gosh, all neighborhoods have those problems.

344
00:25:00,308 --> 00:25:04,811
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think, frankly, he seemed to be taken aback that, as neighbors, we were asking him to do something.

345
00:25:05,711 --> 00:25:11,295
[SPEAKER_20]: So between the city's lack of action and the less than motivated owner representative, my neighbors and I have shouldered this risk long enough.

346
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:12,736
[SPEAKER_20]: The problem has gone on too long.

347
00:25:12,756 --> 00:25:17,259
[SPEAKER_20]: We no longer feel that, after many years of patience, that we need to continue to take care of this property.

348
00:25:18,483 --> 00:25:28,551
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, state law through the powers granted to the health and building departments requires immediate attention to properties that present a public nuisance, specifically ones that are dangerous to life and limb, vacant, open to the weather.

349
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:34,815
[SPEAKER_20]: And certainly it is well within the city's authority to seize the property and further demolish it.

350
00:25:36,236 --> 00:25:47,405
[SPEAKER_20]: So at the same time, it also, the state regulations allow and grant the authority to city bodies to not only seize the property, to demolish it, place a lien on the property,

351
00:25:47,875 --> 00:25:51,597
[SPEAKER_20]: and then any sort of associated costs associated that get passed on to the owner.

352
00:25:52,577 --> 00:25:59,100
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been more than two years, and this property has been in a rapidly worsening state, and the health and building departments have not taken action as required by state law.

353
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,521
[SPEAKER_20]: As I noted, this property is a disaster waiting to happen.

354
00:26:03,402 --> 00:26:09,244
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm certainly no member of this council who would like to wake up each morning and stare at this hazard as I do and many of my neighbors.

355
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:16,147
[SPEAKER_20]: Those of you with small children can certainly understand the fear at a parent's heart, you know, having your kids play around and being near this thing.

356
00:26:16,921 --> 00:26:20,004
[SPEAKER_20]: And for some of you councillors, you're actually a lot closer than you think.

357
00:26:20,044 --> 00:26:25,409
[SPEAKER_20]: I know Councillor Knight, Councillor Penter, Councillor Camuso, you're within several hundred feet of this property in Boynton Road.

358
00:26:26,390 --> 00:26:31,695
[SPEAKER_20]: For that reason, my neighbours and I, we're bringing this issue before the city council, asking for immediate action.

359
00:26:31,935 --> 00:26:34,838
[SPEAKER_20]: We're asking you to direct the health and building departments to act immediately.

360
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:38,501
[SPEAKER_20]: State law gives property owners 24 hours to remedy a vacant property.

361
00:26:39,522 --> 00:26:41,884
[SPEAKER_20]: I think after two years, we're well past that 24-hour period.

362
00:26:42,652 --> 00:26:47,397
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, that said, the same authority that rests with the health and building department also does rest within the city council.

363
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:57,806
[SPEAKER_20]: Per state law allows the, you know, if there is inaction on parts of the health and building departments that the city council can itself also declare that the property be seized and remedied.

364
00:26:59,267 --> 00:26:59,968
[SPEAKER_20]: The laws are there.

365
00:27:00,288 --> 00:27:01,149
[SPEAKER_20]: This isn't optional.

366
00:27:01,589 --> 00:27:05,773
[SPEAKER_20]: It's simply not enough for the city to place a red X on the property and feel that they have done their job.

367
00:27:06,803 --> 00:27:13,649
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's certainly not acceptable for the owner's representative to simply say they'll look into addressing the danger this property presents, especially after nothing has been done for years.

368
00:27:14,350 --> 00:27:20,035
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate the challenges of the legal system, but that's not an excuse to not address an immediate public safety matter.

369
00:27:20,396 --> 00:27:23,959
[SPEAKER_20]: The fire department doesn't refuse to put out a fire if there's a probate matter on the home.

370
00:27:24,219 --> 00:27:26,321
[SPEAKER_20]: They go in and they do what's right and what's necessary.

371
00:27:26,822 --> 00:27:27,402
[SPEAKER_20]: We've had enough.

372
00:27:27,662 --> 00:27:29,344
[SPEAKER_20]: Personally, I live right across from this place.

373
00:27:29,824 --> 00:27:32,587
[SPEAKER_20]: I walk out my door every single day with my daughter when I take her to school.

374
00:27:33,197 --> 00:27:36,079
[SPEAKER_20]: I shouldn't have to constantly be telling her to stay away from the haunted house.

375
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,622
[SPEAKER_20]: Residents and taxpayers, we really demand action.

376
00:27:39,922 --> 00:27:43,184
[SPEAKER_20]: And we really do want to see this property taken care of.

377
00:27:43,945 --> 00:27:45,966
[SPEAKER_20]: And I do, I know I have a neighbor of mine here.

378
00:27:46,727 --> 00:27:52,471
[SPEAKER_20]: Actually, my daughter has asked, if the council allows, she'd like to actually say a few words.

379
00:27:52,491 --> 00:27:53,711
[SPEAKER_20]: She's very eager to say something.

380
00:27:53,731 --> 00:27:55,453
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm going to hand the microphone off to her.

381
00:27:57,174 --> 00:27:57,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

382
00:27:57,694 --> 00:27:59,375
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

383
00:28:00,016 --> 00:28:02,378
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Caroline Crowley, and I live on 59 Boynton Road.

384
00:28:04,124 --> 00:28:09,125
[SPEAKER_00]: And I live across the street from this house, and I just wanted to put my voice out.

385
00:28:09,865 --> 00:28:13,306
[SPEAKER_00]: I, along with many other kids in my neighborhood, love to play outside.

386
00:28:13,786 --> 00:28:17,187
[SPEAKER_00]: The kids along my block are very scared of this house for many reasons.

387
00:28:17,707 --> 00:28:21,548
[SPEAKER_00]: We see raccoons, snakes, and many other wild beasts come out of this house.

388
00:28:22,148 --> 00:28:25,449
[SPEAKER_00]: We feel very unsafe and unsecure with this house being in our neighborhood.

389
00:28:26,129 --> 00:28:28,690
[SPEAKER_00]: that thus we have given it the name The Haunted House.

390
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:35,791
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes us very sad that this house rots when new families could move into a new house where The Haunted House stands.

391
00:28:36,511 --> 00:28:40,072
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I just wanted to voice my opinion in this matter alongside my father.

392
00:28:40,572 --> 00:28:44,533
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that not just adults have their opinion in matters, but children should have a say in things too.

393
00:28:44,553 --> 00:28:45,133
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

394
00:28:45,653 --> 00:28:48,374
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

395
00:28:48,594 --> 00:28:54,095
[SPEAKER_20]: We were at dinner at Salvatore's just prior to this, and I was trying to explain to her what this evening was about.

396
00:28:54,115 --> 00:28:55,375
[SPEAKER_20]: She's like, Dad, can I say something?

397
00:28:57,068 --> 00:28:58,089
[SPEAKER_20]: want.

398
00:28:58,249 --> 00:29:01,991
[SPEAKER_20]: But honestly, we look at this thing every day.

399
00:29:02,471 --> 00:29:06,694
[SPEAKER_20]: We've been patient long enough, and it really is time for some action to be taken.

400
00:29:06,714 --> 00:29:09,655
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you so much, and I'm happy to entertain any questions.

401
00:29:11,356 --> 00:29:12,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Councillor Caviello.

402
00:29:12,837 --> 00:29:13,738
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mike.

403
00:29:13,878 --> 00:29:17,840
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree, it's not right that your neighbours have to come look at this every day.

404
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,161
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a long time.

405
00:29:19,481 --> 00:29:26,065
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been in touch with Paul Mulkey a couple of times on this, and he keeps saying the same thing, the thing they can do that they can do.

406
00:29:27,205 --> 00:29:28,005
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a question for you.

407
00:29:28,125 --> 00:29:28,686
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

408
00:29:29,586 --> 00:29:32,487
[SPEAKER_07]: Does this house have any historical value that it couldn't be turned down?

409
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:34,867
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I would say not.

410
00:29:34,927 --> 00:29:41,349
[SPEAKER_20]: In fact, my wife is a member of the Medford Historical Commission and who actually has authority over saying whether or not buildings can be turned down.

411
00:29:41,429 --> 00:29:41,790
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

412
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,850
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it over 100 years old where it couldn't be turned down?

413
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:44,751
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's not.

414
00:29:44,771 --> 00:29:48,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you said, looking at the pictures, I don't know who's rehabbing this.

415
00:29:48,732 --> 00:29:49,672
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not much rehab.

416
00:29:49,932 --> 00:29:52,593
[SPEAKER_20]: You go around there, literally you see into the roof.

417
00:29:52,633 --> 00:29:55,234
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not fair that your neighbors have to look at this and yourself and your children.

418
00:29:56,390 --> 00:30:09,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I don't know what course the city has to force them to either tear it down or... Well, I'll quote you... Tear it down or even fence it in so no one can get in there.

419
00:30:09,874 --> 00:30:11,074
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

420
00:30:11,094 --> 00:30:14,635
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate the notion of fencing, but I think at this point in time... I know.

421
00:30:14,855 --> 00:30:15,335
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an eyesore.

422
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:21,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, you shouldn't... Let's say it drops your property value and everybody else's value in the neighborhood.

423
00:30:25,162 --> 00:30:33,246
[SPEAKER_07]: I would think that we want to have our attorney contact their attorney and get them in here and try to get some kind of remedy on this.

424
00:30:34,067 --> 00:30:35,007
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll quote Mass.

425
00:30:35,027 --> 00:30:36,688
[SPEAKER_20]: General Law, Chapter 143, Section 7.

426
00:30:37,588 --> 00:30:49,514
[SPEAKER_20]: If the public safety so requires and if the aldermen are selected in so order, the inspector of buildings may immediately enter upon the property with the necessary workmen assistance to cause such unsafe structure to be made safe or taken down without delay.

427
00:30:51,222 --> 00:30:53,784
[SPEAKER_07]: They said the house is condemned, so I would think that'd be enough.

428
00:30:54,264 --> 00:30:56,565
[SPEAKER_20]: I would seemingly have to disagree on that circumstance.

429
00:30:56,625 --> 00:31:05,390
[SPEAKER_20]: I would say if the whole notion there is to make the structure safe, I would definitively argue that building is far beyond the condition of being considered safe.

430
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:11,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, if you could get the building inspector to answer this and find out why he hasn't.

431
00:31:11,993 --> 00:31:14,935
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Caviello that the building inspector

432
00:31:15,702 --> 00:31:26,833
[SPEAKER_14]: report back to the Medford City Council regarding the actions taken and need for further action on the property at 56 Poynton Road.

433
00:31:27,454 --> 00:31:28,475
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Longo-Kern.

434
00:31:28,755 --> 00:31:30,337
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, President DelaRusso.

435
00:31:31,938 --> 00:31:36,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Crowley, John Cervone, he's the attorney for the estate.

436
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:37,761
[SPEAKER_20]: He is correct.

437
00:31:37,801 --> 00:31:45,248
[SPEAKER_20]: He is the sister Norma has engaged him as the attorney to navigate the- Is he out in Waltham?

438
00:31:45,868 --> 00:31:47,009
[SPEAKER_20]: He is out in Waltham, yes.

439
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:51,033
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been in probate for three years?

440
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:52,085
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

441
00:31:52,205 --> 00:31:56,388
[SPEAKER_20]: And I personally, I I've been through probate with family members and it does not take.

442
00:31:56,428 --> 00:31:57,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it takes, it takes about a year.

443
00:31:57,769 --> 00:32:00,611
[SPEAKER_03]: So the sister Norma, she must be the executor.

444
00:32:00,911 --> 00:32:04,774
[SPEAKER_20]: She, the, the Norma is, um, it's, it's an unusual history with the property.

445
00:32:04,854 --> 00:32:11,878
[SPEAKER_20]: The, uh, the original owners, uh, Mr. Bagnullo's parents, uh, lived at the home along with, uh, Mr. Joseph Bagnullo here.

446
00:32:12,319 --> 00:32:13,299
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, the father passed away.

447
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:17,842
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to probably say 20 years ago, uh, at the time the mother was living there as well.

448
00:32:17,902 --> 00:32:20,344
[SPEAKER_20]: And then Mr. Joseph Bagnullo moved back and moved in with him.

449
00:32:20,824 --> 00:32:24,407
[SPEAKER_20]: The mother passed away, I want to say, about six or seven years ago.

450
00:32:24,467 --> 00:32:27,469
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, the father neither had a will, nor the mother did not have a will.

451
00:32:28,169 --> 00:32:30,551
[SPEAKER_20]: Mr. Bagdullo here, he did not have a will.

452
00:32:30,631 --> 00:32:38,856
[SPEAKER_20]: So really, the only remaining known heir is the sister, who lives up on the north shore of the Chelmsford of Billerica.

453
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:42,578
[SPEAKER_20]: So there was really no action at the time.

454
00:32:42,658 --> 00:32:44,500
[SPEAKER_20]: And frankly, I've been hounding the building department.

455
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:48,061
[SPEAKER_20]: pretty much for the past three years consistently.

456
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:51,502
[SPEAKER_20]: And the answer has always been, yeah, it's going to the legal system.

457
00:32:51,562 --> 00:32:52,722
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it's going to the legal system.

458
00:32:53,282 --> 00:33:01,464
[SPEAKER_20]: And frankly, the naming of John Cervone as an attorney, that only first came to being around in the January time frame.

459
00:33:01,484 --> 00:33:07,026
[SPEAKER_20]: For the prior two and a half, three years, there was never a name of an attorney that was surfaced.

460
00:33:07,146 --> 00:33:13,768
[SPEAKER_20]: So my humble opinion, I think that there really was no action being taken on the part of the sister to try to move this thing forward.

461
00:33:16,083 --> 00:33:22,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I just feel like three years in probate court is a little long, so I'm wondering if they started the probate process late.

462
00:33:22,872 --> 00:33:24,655
[SPEAKER_20]: I definitely get that suspicion, yes.

463
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,010
[SPEAKER_03]: because obviously the land's worth something.

464
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:29,531
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully somebody will buy it, tear it down, and build a new house.

465
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:30,131
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll be honest.

466
00:33:30,731 --> 00:33:36,433
[SPEAKER_20]: When I went to go visit Mr. Russo at the building department, he had a list of developers that have contacted him.

467
00:33:36,573 --> 00:33:42,175
[SPEAKER_20]: I've had a number of developers knock on my door, send me letters saying, would you sell it to me?

468
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:44,056
[SPEAKER_20]: And I said, if I could sell it to you, I would.

469
00:33:44,836 --> 00:33:46,376
[SPEAKER_20]: But yeah, no, in this circumstance.

470
00:33:46,757 --> 00:33:48,057
[SPEAKER_20]: What's that?

471
00:33:48,357 --> 00:33:48,797
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

472
00:33:48,817 --> 00:33:51,478
[SPEAKER_20]: So yeah, I've had more than enough developers.

473
00:33:51,498 --> 00:33:52,539
[SPEAKER_20]: And the other neighbors have said, hey,

474
00:33:54,162 --> 00:33:54,482
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

475
00:33:54,642 --> 00:33:55,763
[SPEAKER_20]: Someone wants to buy this place.

476
00:33:57,524 --> 00:33:59,085
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Carviello had a good point.

477
00:33:59,105 --> 00:34:15,194
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we'll see if one of our solicitors, city solicitor or assistant city solicitor could reach out to Attorney Cervone and ask where they are in probate and how much longer it's going to take and see if we can find out what they plan on doing with the property as soon as possible.

478
00:34:15,214 --> 00:34:21,077
[SPEAKER_14]: It might be particularly tricky where there may have not been previous wills of the previously deeded people.

479
00:34:21,657 --> 00:34:23,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Therefore, it's in land court as well.

480
00:34:24,505 --> 00:34:31,309
[SPEAKER_14]: So we will make that amendment to the main motion by Councilor Longo-Curran.

481
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:35,731
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be then this children, if he had no children, it would be the sister's property.

482
00:34:36,111 --> 00:34:39,093
[SPEAKER_03]: Sister would get obtained by inheritance, yes.

483
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:41,314
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, I think she'd be able to sell it.

484
00:34:41,334 --> 00:34:43,816
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a matter of if it's finished going through probate.

485
00:34:45,857 --> 00:34:47,177
[SPEAKER_20]: That is what I've heard as well.

486
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:48,018
[SPEAKER_20]: Councilor Knight.

487
00:34:50,142 --> 00:34:53,925
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we can get an update, I know we asked the building department why they haven't done anything.

488
00:34:53,945 --> 00:35:01,330
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could also get an update from Karen Rose with her take on this and why she feels that the city can't do anything.

489
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:05,453
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's where I- Further amended by Councilor Longo Kern.

490
00:35:05,573 --> 00:35:06,214
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

491
00:35:07,074 --> 00:35:08,315
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

492
00:35:08,355 --> 00:35:10,617
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Crowley, thank you for taking the time to come down here this evening.

493
00:35:10,637 --> 00:35:11,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Certainly.

494
00:35:12,018 --> 00:35:17,522
[SPEAKER_10]: When did the meeting take place through the chairman to the gentleman with Mr. Cervone?

495
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:46,347
[SPEAKER_20]: The, uh, meeting was on January 21st of this year that, uh, Mr. Cervone, uh, visited the property with his contractor, uh, to have a meeting as well at the, at present at that meeting was, uh, John Cervone, uh, myself and several other neighbors, uh, to, uh, you know, we were engaged, uh, engaged the attorney and, um, you've, you've indicated represented that you've made official complaints with the board of health and the building department on this issue in writing and I've got a link telephone.

496
00:35:46,367 --> 00:35:46,487
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

497
00:35:46,527 --> 00:35:46,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Um,

498
00:35:48,815 --> 00:35:53,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you do me a favor and just give me that site again that you gave through the general laws?

499
00:35:55,479 --> 00:35:56,460
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, I'm sorry, yes.

500
00:35:56,520 --> 00:36:01,023
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that was Master of the Law, Chapter 143, Section 7.

501
00:36:02,303 --> 00:36:03,964
[SPEAKER_10]: You referred to Selectmen and Board of Aldermen?

502
00:36:04,985 --> 00:36:09,308
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, the one with respect to the aldermen, that one is State Law, Chapter 139, Section 13B.

503
00:36:09,428 --> 00:36:15,692
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm happy to send you an email with a whole bunch of the other references.

504
00:36:15,752 --> 00:36:17,273
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President, that'd be great.

505
00:36:17,293 --> 00:36:17,653
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be great.

506
00:36:17,693 --> 00:36:17,873
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

507
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:26,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, Mr. President, I think it would make sense for us to have the city solicitor also render a legal opinion as to whether or not this council under, um, GL one, four, three, section seven and nine.

508
00:36:26,847 --> 00:36:39,155
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Al, uh, has the power and authority to, uh, prompt the end of the building department and the board of health to go in there and see if we can get rid of this house and, uh, take the necessary steps that we need to do to beautify the neighborhood and ensure that these residents have a strong quality of life.

509
00:36:39,836 --> 00:36:41,637
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, Mr. Crowley,

510
00:36:42,042 --> 00:36:43,002
[SPEAKER_10]: was absolutely correct.

511
00:36:43,082 --> 00:36:45,063
[SPEAKER_10]: I do live within walking distance of the house.

512
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:45,863
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been by the house.

513
00:36:45,903 --> 00:36:46,523
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen the house.

514
00:36:47,224 --> 00:36:48,244
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I've seen the house.

515
00:36:48,424 --> 00:36:49,224
[SPEAKER_10]: We called it a haunted house.

516
00:36:49,264 --> 00:36:55,306
[SPEAKER_10]: I think when we were kids and, um, you know, I, I think that, uh, they've been very patient up there.

517
00:36:55,326 --> 00:36:58,907
[SPEAKER_10]: They've, they've taken appropriate steps, done their homework and made this very easy for us.

518
00:36:59,507 --> 00:37:06,569
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, so with that being said, Mr. President, I don't think the motion of council car VLO is amended by vice president Longo Kern and counselor night.

519
00:37:06,629 --> 00:37:06,949
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

520
00:37:08,670 --> 00:37:09,750
[SPEAKER_05]: Counselor Camuso.

521
00:37:10,993 --> 00:37:18,759
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President, and when this originally came before us, I went back into my records, my electronic mail records.

522
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:24,543
[SPEAKER_05]: And on January 7th, 2015, I have an email from Paul Moki, who's our building commissioner.

523
00:37:24,563 --> 00:37:29,187
[SPEAKER_05]: At the time, the gentleman at the podium brought it to my attention, as well as several members of this council.

524
00:37:30,768 --> 00:37:39,415
[SPEAKER_05]: This issue is now with the Attorney General's office on this particular house, because they're looking at, as you know, and you've been part of the discussions, you didn't say it this evening.

525
00:37:39,782 --> 00:37:53,066
[SPEAKER_05]: but the Attorney General's office has a program where they'll actually take over the property and get it up to code, up to par, and it would all be leaned and everything like the gentleman said.

526
00:37:53,606 --> 00:38:08,290
[SPEAKER_05]: With that being said, I think the city has to at this point, looking at the pictures, the roof, the holes in the porch, you get the X on the front, and for those that don't know that, that's for the fire department if they show up to, you don't go in.

527
00:38:10,002 --> 00:38:16,886
[SPEAKER_05]: The building down here had the X on it, the red X, and that's strictly to keep our public safety officials safe.

528
00:38:17,446 --> 00:38:20,908
[SPEAKER_05]: And before I go any further, I want to tell you, you did an excellent job.

529
00:38:22,068 --> 00:38:22,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very good.

530
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:25,030
[SPEAKER_05]: You should be proud of yourself to get down here with your dad tonight.

531
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:38,317
[SPEAKER_05]: But with that being said, I really think that the city has to at least go out there, spend the money, even if it's a couple thousand dollars at this point, and at least board it up, fix the hole in the

532
00:38:39,057 --> 00:38:41,238
[SPEAKER_05]: In the porch, there's a big hole in the porch that I saw.

533
00:38:41,738 --> 00:38:48,680
[SPEAKER_05]: Things that are definite safety issues as of right now, if someone walks on that porch, the roof should be at least closed.

534
00:38:50,581 --> 00:38:53,982
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we should do that and at least lean it for that portion right now.

535
00:38:54,462 --> 00:39:01,965
[SPEAKER_05]: As the gentleman at the podium stated, it's an eyesore and it's in the proper authority's hands of the Attorney General's office.

536
00:39:02,419 --> 00:39:17,327
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's incumbent upon the city to do the immediate need of at least shoring it up enough to the point where the AG's office comes in with either a bulldozer or whatever the outcome is, but at least make it safe for the exact time being.

537
00:39:17,747 --> 00:39:26,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if a child goes up there, just walks on the porch, runs up on the porch to have them call 911, a young kid walking home from school or something.

538
00:39:26,192 --> 00:39:27,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's a big hole in the porch that we just saw.

539
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:31,722
[SPEAKER_05]: That is definitely a very much safety hazard.

540
00:39:32,202 --> 00:39:41,589
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we could also make that part of the record and also ask John Bevuso and Paul Moki to give this council an update from the Attorney General's office on exactly where it is.

541
00:39:42,009 --> 00:39:48,794
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing is too, I believe there are some neighbors, as I told you in the past, that are very much interested in purchasing the piece of property.

542
00:39:49,434 --> 00:39:54,517
[SPEAKER_05]: And if there's been any more developments on that, if we could also ask that question as well.

543
00:39:55,598 --> 00:39:58,120
[SPEAKER_14]: And as far as the- As amended by Councilor Camuso.

544
00:39:58,538 --> 00:40:07,782
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe the issue here is the people that are in the line of the heirs and the common heirs, even when it's not in the will.

545
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:09,202
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what it's called, common heirs?

546
00:40:09,683 --> 00:40:10,963
[SPEAKER_05]: The line of succession.

547
00:40:12,844 --> 00:40:17,246
[SPEAKER_05]: All of them are incapacitated from what I hear, and that's what's making it difficult.

548
00:40:17,306 --> 00:40:22,188
[SPEAKER_05]: And I believe that the attorney may have been appointed by the court or the AG's office as well.

549
00:40:23,749 --> 00:40:27,190
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't say that with 100% certainty, but knowing a little background on it and where it's at,

550
00:40:27,742 --> 00:40:29,083
[SPEAKER_05]: and the timing seems about right.

551
00:40:29,183 --> 00:40:32,704
[SPEAKER_05]: January 7th, I was told that the Attorney General's office is on it.

552
00:40:33,125 --> 00:40:36,226
[SPEAKER_05]: January 21st, there's an attorney out at the site.

553
00:40:36,686 --> 00:40:39,808
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's been communication between the AG's office and the city.

554
00:40:40,088 --> 00:40:44,190
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm assuming that the attorney is probably appointed through the court by the AG's office.

555
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:51,674
[SPEAKER_20]: I do know that it has been in the Attorney General's program until as early as the middle, early of last year as well.

556
00:40:51,734 --> 00:40:56,356
[SPEAKER_20]: So the attorney certainly is a byproduct of hoping

557
00:40:57,095 --> 00:40:57,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

558
00:40:57,736 --> 00:41:03,619
[SPEAKER_05]: And I certainly understand your frustrations, but unfortunately, as you know, the city still has to follow the certain procedures.

559
00:41:04,039 --> 00:41:08,762
[SPEAKER_05]: We could go in with the wrecking ball, and I'm sure all of us, including the mayor, would be for that if we could.

560
00:41:09,202 --> 00:41:09,483
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.

561
00:41:09,503 --> 00:41:14,265
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have to follow the appropriate procedures and get court orders and all that stuff to proceed.

562
00:41:14,325 --> 00:41:14,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

563
00:41:14,726 --> 00:41:21,189
[SPEAKER_05]: But in the interest of public safety, I think it has to be shored up, at least to the point where it's not... Or put a fence around it.

564
00:41:22,090 --> 00:41:23,911
[SPEAKER_05]: Quite honestly, there should be a fence around it right now.

565
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:25,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, certainly a fence would be, you know,

566
00:41:26,712 --> 00:41:28,614
[SPEAKER_14]: as amended by Councilor Camuso.

567
00:41:31,556 --> 00:41:31,876
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

568
00:41:31,896 --> 00:41:35,178
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Marks.

569
00:41:36,699 --> 00:41:37,719
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

570
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:46,365
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um, you know, back some years ago, the city council voted on a city ordinance call called the clean it or lean it ordinance.

571
00:41:47,446 --> 00:41:55,871
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, this particular house would be an ideal situation to implement the clean it or lean it.

572
00:41:56,792 --> 00:42:01,953
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's at just the minimum of getting in there and taking out all the debris around the home.

573
00:42:02,654 --> 00:42:12,896
[SPEAKER_16]: You have, as you mentioned, there's a car, a rusted car in the backyard, and there's a rusted gas tank on the back of the car.

574
00:42:13,416 --> 00:42:22,559
[SPEAKER_16]: And if you look at the picture on page six, it's surrounded by thousands of dried up leaves that happened to go from that property onto the neighbor's property.

575
00:42:23,379 --> 00:42:26,540
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's a situation waiting to happen.

576
00:42:27,786 --> 00:42:37,451
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I'm dumbfounded why the city hasn't played more of an active role, Mr. President, in seeing that this house, at least the exterior be cleaned up.

577
00:42:38,232 --> 00:42:39,052
[SPEAKER_16]: That was mentioned.

578
00:42:39,092 --> 00:42:49,978
[SPEAKER_16]: The roof that you can actually see through, it has a giant skylight that I guess birds and anything else, squirrels and anything else that wants to get into the house.

579
00:42:51,479 --> 00:42:54,921
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I find that ironic, Mr. President, that

580
00:42:55,638 --> 00:43:10,549
[SPEAKER_16]: It was only a few years ago that on Momola Way, there was a dispute between neighbors and one neighbor thought to get back at the other neighbor by making his front lawn, maybe members of the council remember this, look like a junkyard.

581
00:43:11,029 --> 00:43:13,731
[SPEAKER_16]: So the neighbor put out an old tub on his front lawn.

582
00:43:14,051 --> 00:43:15,552
[SPEAKER_16]: He put out a toilet.

583
00:43:15,612 --> 00:43:18,795
[SPEAKER_16]: He put out a hundred different items on his front lawn.

584
00:43:19,135 --> 00:43:21,837
[SPEAKER_16]: And we all know Momola is a nice trimmed area.

585
00:43:22,652 --> 00:43:26,135
[SPEAKER_16]: And just so happens to be across from the mayor's home.

586
00:43:26,736 --> 00:43:31,180
[SPEAKER_16]: And within a matter of a day or two, this is just some debris on his front lawn.

587
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:41,128
[SPEAKER_16]: Every city department, every city entity, the fire department, police department, code enforcement, building commissioner, they were down at that home immediately.

588
00:43:41,829 --> 00:43:44,151
[SPEAKER_16]: And that house was cleaned up overnight.

589
00:43:44,912 --> 00:43:46,433
[SPEAKER_16]: All the stuff that was on that lawn.

590
00:43:47,194 --> 00:43:48,695
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know, it's amazing that

591
00:43:49,456 --> 00:43:52,783
[SPEAKER_16]: This hasn't taken place, Mr. President, at this site.

592
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:55,508
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I remember dropping my kids off at St.

593
00:43:55,528 --> 00:43:59,997
[SPEAKER_16]: Joe's for many years and driving up and saying, wow, what's going on with this property?

594
00:44:00,432 --> 00:44:06,796
[SPEAKER_16]: And then I saw the red, the scolodex that was put on the house that says, don't go in there.

595
00:44:07,396 --> 00:44:10,318
[SPEAKER_16]: And you know, I don't want to make light of this, but no, absolutely not.

596
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:21,545
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, honestly, the city administration in this city is so used to seeing condemned city buildings that they may look at this house and say, this house is in good condition.

597
00:44:22,856 --> 00:44:26,799
[SPEAKER_16]: Honestly, you know, I hate to say that the red X should be on the police department.

598
00:44:27,059 --> 00:44:28,661
[SPEAKER_16]: It should have been on the DPW yard.

599
00:44:28,941 --> 00:44:33,084
[SPEAKER_16]: It should have been on a host of other buildings that should have been condemned to this, this house.

600
00:44:33,464 --> 00:44:40,029
[SPEAKER_16]: But honestly, Mr. President, this, this issue, we need to meet with the city solicitor immediately, find out what's going on.

601
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:45,473
[SPEAKER_16]: In my opinion, the wrecking ball should have already come out and then answer questions after the fact.

602
00:44:46,114 --> 00:44:47,835
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what should have happened, Mr. President.

603
00:44:48,542 --> 00:44:57,868
[SPEAKER_16]: And that that's what, and also Mr. President, if we can make it part of the report, is this tax delinquent, is this a home been up to snuff when taxes?

604
00:44:58,189 --> 00:45:00,050
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure if you've looked into that yet or not.

605
00:45:00,250 --> 00:45:07,935
[SPEAKER_14]: I amended by councilor marks that the city treasury report back to us regarding the tax situation on the property.

606
00:45:08,776 --> 00:45:09,477
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President.

607
00:45:09,677 --> 00:45:15,881
[SPEAKER_16]: And I, you know, I know all the members mentioned about having the city solicitor and the building commissioner,

608
00:45:16,305 --> 00:45:18,826
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think there needs to be an emergency meeting set up.

609
00:45:20,027 --> 00:45:21,827
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, tomorrow can't be quick enough.

610
00:45:22,228 --> 00:45:23,968
[SPEAKER_16]: And if we want to do it on site, all the better.

611
00:45:24,449 --> 00:45:27,510
[SPEAKER_16]: But this is absolutely unacceptable.

612
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:34,293
[SPEAKER_16]: And in my opinion, no neighbor should have to drive by or live next to this home.

613
00:45:34,873 --> 00:45:41,856
[SPEAKER_16]: And especially with storage of gas on site, we have rules and regulations about open storage of gas.

614
00:45:42,256 --> 00:45:46,118
[SPEAKER_16]: And clearly, I can see not only the car, but a gas tank

615
00:45:47,049 --> 00:45:48,971
[SPEAKER_16]: a separate gas tank on the back of the car.

616
00:45:49,351 --> 00:45:50,052
[SPEAKER_16]: How old is the car?

617
00:45:50,132 --> 00:45:50,912
[SPEAKER_16]: It's rusted out.

618
00:45:51,312 --> 00:45:53,034
[SPEAKER_16]: This is, I believe, the thing.

619
00:45:53,214 --> 00:45:54,015
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what it's called.

620
00:45:54,495 --> 00:45:55,275
[SPEAKER_16]: Is this not the thing?

621
00:45:55,716 --> 00:45:57,697
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, it's funny.

622
00:45:57,757 --> 00:45:59,639
[SPEAKER_20]: It's kind of an amalgamation.

623
00:46:00,519 --> 00:46:02,901
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a Jeep, I think, originally of some sort.

624
00:46:03,922 --> 00:46:06,264
[SPEAKER_16]: It's got to be from the 1960s or 70s.

625
00:46:06,304 --> 00:46:09,346
[SPEAKER_16]: Perhaps the gas is evacuated.

626
00:46:09,366 --> 00:46:10,327
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, we're not sure of that.

627
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,548
[SPEAKER_16]: It's in a metal container that's rusting.

628
00:46:13,919 --> 00:46:17,401
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's, that would be my recommendation to clean it and leave it immediately.

629
00:46:17,961 --> 00:46:20,743
[SPEAKER_16]: Not sure why we have ordinances when the city doesn't enforce them.

630
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,684
[SPEAKER_16]: So that would be immediately.

631
00:46:23,104 --> 00:46:32,610
[SPEAKER_16]: And then the boarding up of the roof, like councilor Camuso said, the porch, and then a meeting on, uh, whether or not, uh, this city I think is at the point where the wrecking ball should come out.

632
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:41,175
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. President level this property, clean it up, and then, uh, worry about whatever suits that may be taken after the fact, because in my opinion,

633
00:46:41,848 --> 00:46:44,770
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think these people have a leg to stand on with this particular property.

634
00:46:46,131 --> 00:46:51,095
[SPEAKER_16]: And the infestation in this home is going to lead to infestation in the neighborhood.

635
00:46:51,756 --> 00:46:53,057
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's a concern.

636
00:46:53,077 --> 00:46:56,019
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's a concern if I lived next door that I'd be concerned about.

637
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:59,261
[SPEAKER_16]: So those would be my recommendations, Mr. President.

638
00:47:00,022 --> 00:47:07,768
[SPEAKER_16]: It's nice to put up a sign saying City of Medford Danger Keep Out and the X, but that falls far short of the mark, Mr. President.

639
00:47:08,102 --> 00:47:09,442
[SPEAKER_16]: and what the city should be doing.

640
00:47:09,642 --> 00:47:10,023
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

641
00:47:10,063 --> 00:47:10,543
[SPEAKER_16]: Counselor.

642
00:47:10,583 --> 00:47:11,623
[SPEAKER_07]: Counselor care of yellow.

643
00:47:11,843 --> 00:47:12,043
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

644
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:14,624
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we'll take just on one last thing.

645
00:47:14,644 --> 00:47:20,105
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I'd have to make a motion that we have the fire department immediately go down there tomorrow and remove the car.

646
00:47:20,886 --> 00:47:29,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, again, uh, with the exposed gas tank and who knows if there's any gas in there, but, uh, as a fire department can immediately get the car out of there.

647
00:47:30,493 --> 00:47:40,078
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, further amended by councilor Caviello that the fire department, uh, investigate the gasoline in the truck and remediate the situation immediately.

648
00:47:40,558 --> 00:47:45,640
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the main motion of councilor Caviello as amended by the other counselors, all those in favor.

649
00:47:49,942 --> 00:47:53,764
[SPEAKER_16]: Do we know from the building commissioner if the gas has been turned off in the home?

650
00:47:54,504 --> 00:47:59,667
[SPEAKER_14]: We've received no communication to my knowledge from any, uh, departmental head.

651
00:48:00,147 --> 00:48:01,728
[SPEAKER_14]: regarding said property council.

652
00:48:01,788 --> 00:48:02,428
[SPEAKER_20]: I can clarify.

653
00:48:02,468 --> 00:48:08,192
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe shortly after the passing of Mr. Bagnold that the gas and other utilities were disconnected from the property.

654
00:48:08,252 --> 00:48:08,572
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

655
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:23,080
[SPEAKER_16]: I would just say if we can have a report from the building commission or the building department to make sure in light of what we've seen in the news regarding gas and explosions recently, I don't want to alarm anyone, but we should have a report from the building department.

656
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:28,023
[SPEAKER_14]: Further amended by council marks that the building commissioner give a comprehensive report

657
00:48:28,731 --> 00:48:30,713
[SPEAKER_14]: regarding utilities at the property.

658
00:48:31,393 --> 00:48:34,335
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Caviello, as amended, all those in favor?

659
00:48:35,016 --> 00:48:35,636
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

660
00:48:36,237 --> 00:48:36,937
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion carries.

661
00:48:37,538 --> 00:48:38,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much, sir.

662
00:48:38,418 --> 00:48:43,602
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you so much, all of you, and I appreciate the time and hopefully the prompt and speedy address.

663
00:48:43,622 --> 00:48:46,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Would it be appropriate for us to return to the regular order of business?

664
00:48:48,006 --> 00:48:49,427
[SPEAKER_14]: Moved by Councilor Camuso.

665
00:48:50,748 --> 00:48:54,611
[SPEAKER_14]: Returning back to the regular order of business, 15-314, offered by Councilor Knight,

666
00:48:56,976 --> 00:49:05,741
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council recognize Andrew Cronin and Adrienne Perrazzo on their receipt of the Boston Bruins Sportsmanship Award.

667
00:49:06,221 --> 00:49:11,824
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Cronin is a member of the GBL Champion Medford High School Boys Hockey Team, and Ms.

668
00:49:11,864 --> 00:49:17,307
[SPEAKER_14]: Perrazzo is a member of the GBL Champion Medford High School Girls Hockey Team.

669
00:49:17,767 --> 00:49:25,952
[SPEAKER_14]: Both have had outstanding interscholastic hockey careers at Medford High School, while exhibiting the highest levels of sportsmanship and leadership

670
00:49:26,570 --> 00:49:36,892
[SPEAKER_14]: be it further resolved that they be invited to a future Medford City Council meeting to receive recognition and council commendation.

671
00:49:37,372 --> 00:49:38,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Nice.

672
00:49:39,033 --> 00:49:40,393
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

673
00:49:41,133 --> 00:49:50,255
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe for those people at home who aren't watching the city council meeting this evening and are watching the Boston Bruins, in between the first and second period this evening, Mr. Cronin and Ms.

674
00:49:50,295 --> 00:49:54,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Peraza will be awarded the sportsmanship award by the Boston Bruins.

675
00:49:55,085 --> 00:49:59,686
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've spoken with both their coaches, and I've actually had the opportunity to speak with both of them as well.

676
00:49:59,946 --> 00:50:08,427

[SPEAKER_10]: Their coaches would like to come down and say a few words on behalf of the children when they do receive their citations, if this council is so willing to adopt the resolution.

678
00:50:16,969 --> 00:50:22,350
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would like to reserve comment for the people that work directly with them and know them best, Mr. President.

679
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:24,370

735
00:52:41,378 --> 00:52:43,079
[SPEAKER_07]: And I recommend approval, Mr. President.

736

[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

00:52:46,901 --> 00:52:48,562
[SPEAKER_05]: And I second the approval.

739
00:52:52,591 --> 00:53:05,179
[SPEAKER_05]: Council marks was very instrumental with this new development down there in working with the neighbors in the entire Medford City Council To put a charcoal filter on so that the neighbors aren't overburdened by the smell down there.

740
00:53:05,239 --> 00:53:12,543
[SPEAKER_05]: So just to Like to bring that point up And we actually have the filtration system right here.

741
00:53:12,583 --> 00:53:16,746
[SPEAKER_05]: The gentleman just gave us so uh Once again, thank you.

742
00:53:16,806 --> 00:53:18,307
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the neighbors were very interested in that

743
00:53:18,812 --> 00:53:27,494
[SPEAKER_05]: As well as this evening, I got a few phone calls from people that were down in Florida that live on 4th Street, and just wanted to make sure that it was brought up this evening.

744
00:53:28,014 --> 00:53:28,435
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

745
00:53:29,295 --> 00:53:35,476
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion approved by Councilor Caviello, seconded by Councilor Camuso, Councilor Penta.

746
00:53:35,536 --> 00:53:36,757
[SPEAKER_19]: Quick question.

747
00:53:36,777 --> 00:53:39,457
[SPEAKER_19]: Has the drive-through issue been resolved?

748
00:53:40,678 --> 00:53:41,658
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, with the charcoal filter.

749
00:53:42,133 --> 00:53:44,355
[SPEAKER_19]: No, the drive-thru issue, not the charcoal filter.

750
00:53:44,415 --> 00:53:45,156
[SPEAKER_19]: There was a drive-thru.

751
00:53:45,256 --> 00:53:48,059
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, so the landlord came in for the special permit for the drive-thru.

752
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:54,166
[SPEAKER_21]: And I believe there's an issue with how it was, how the exiting was, but that has been, there has been a modification to that.

753
00:53:55,127 --> 00:53:55,988
[SPEAKER_19]: So when was that done?

754
00:53:56,068 --> 00:53:57,930
[SPEAKER_19]: Because we, I haven't seen the modification.

755
00:53:59,211 --> 00:54:02,294
[SPEAKER_19]: No, the last time there was anything proposed, it was up to the planning board.

756
00:54:02,695 --> 00:54:04,677
[SPEAKER_19]: We never saw the final, the final result.

757
00:54:05,708 --> 00:54:10,429
[SPEAKER_14]: We passed it on the condition that it be resolved, as requested.

758
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,331
[SPEAKER_16]: Turn your microphone.

759
00:54:15,431 --> 00:54:15,971
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

760
00:54:17,351 --> 00:54:18,392
[SPEAKER_16]: Traffic, if you want to say that.

761
00:54:18,412 --> 00:54:18,792
[SPEAKER_16]: You're right.

762
00:54:18,812 --> 00:54:19,852
[SPEAKER_16]: That's right.

763
00:54:19,972 --> 00:54:26,314
[SPEAKER_16]: And they put a pitch to it, a curve, a pitch, I don't know what you'd call it, so you weren't directly coming out into the traffic.

764
00:54:27,294 --> 00:54:30,675
[SPEAKER_19]: I thought it was either you coming in or coming out on Riverside, but you're exiting.

765
00:54:31,215 --> 00:54:31,715
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no.

766
00:54:32,196 --> 00:54:33,856
[SPEAKER_19]: We're talking inside the parking lot itself.

767
00:54:34,209 --> 00:54:36,911
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I'm talking about them coming in or out off of Riverside Avenue.

768
00:54:38,411 --> 00:54:40,833
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you coming in or off of Riverside Avenue?

769
00:54:41,213 --> 00:54:41,333
[SPEAKER_19]: Out.

770
00:54:41,693 --> 00:54:43,274
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, that I can't speak to that.

771
00:54:43,314 --> 00:54:44,215
[SPEAKER_19]: That's something that's a lot of hard work.

772
00:54:44,235 --> 00:54:44,995
[SPEAKER_19]: Because that was the issue, remember?

773
00:54:45,015 --> 00:54:49,298
[SPEAKER_19]: You brought up the idea, why can't they go back in between the two buildings if they exit and go down Commercial Street?

774
00:54:49,718 --> 00:54:54,621
[SPEAKER_14]: Their license was granted on condition of straightening that out.

775
00:54:55,481 --> 00:55:03,786
[SPEAKER_14]: And we saw the drawings, if I remember correctly, which included, I think, egress out to Commercial Street and

776
00:55:04,263 --> 00:55:11,566
[SPEAKER_16]: they were going to have signage that prompted you to take a right onto commercial, but you were able to go back into the stop and shop parking lot.

777
00:55:11,787 --> 00:55:12,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct.

778
00:55:12,327 --> 00:55:14,328
[SPEAKER_14]: But they were, they were prompting you to go out.

779
00:55:14,528 --> 00:55:27,174
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was further recommended if we recall counselor to, uh, uh, have Riverside Ave painted, uh, indicating not to block the, uh, egress onto Riverside Ave, not to create a gridlock.

780
00:55:27,454 --> 00:55:29,395
[SPEAKER_19]: Is Riverside Avenue an entrance or an exit?

781
00:55:32,147 --> 00:55:34,108
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe it's both, but I don't want to speak.

782
00:55:34,128 --> 00:55:36,169
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm not going to, I don't want to speak to that for sure.

783
00:55:36,189 --> 00:55:37,350
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what it wasn't supposed to be.

784
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:40,011
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't, I, I've never, I'm speaking out of information.

785
00:55:40,051 --> 00:55:41,032
[SPEAKER_07]: Counselor cafe.

786
00:55:42,312 --> 00:55:44,233
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and that other stuff.

787
00:55:44,273 --> 00:55:45,194
[SPEAKER_07]: He's not pregnant.

788
00:55:45,234 --> 00:55:49,796
[SPEAKER_07]: This gentleman is here for an hour and he's probably not qualified to answer those questions.

789
00:55:49,916 --> 00:55:51,677
[SPEAKER_07]: The chair is in agreement with you.

790
00:55:52,738 --> 00:55:54,059
[SPEAKER_19]: Can we get a report back on that?

791
00:55:54,499 --> 00:55:56,480
[SPEAKER_07]: So this gentleman, I don't think I'm not from that.

792
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:58,821
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think he's qualified to answer those questions.

793
00:55:58,841 --> 00:55:58,921
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

794
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:05,561
[SPEAKER_14]: The chair will, the clerk will give us the decision regarding that matter.

795
00:56:06,702 --> 00:56:07,682
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, give us the report.

796
00:56:07,982 --> 00:56:08,983
[SPEAKER_19]: They give us the final report.

797
00:56:10,383 --> 00:56:14,084
[SPEAKER_09]: It's in our record.

798
00:56:14,945 --> 00:56:16,985
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we get a copy of it?

799
00:56:17,065 --> 00:56:23,067
[SPEAKER_16]: There's an entrance and exit from Riverside F and there's also an exit from the back of the pocket.

800
00:56:23,787 --> 00:56:25,568
[SPEAKER_16]: So there is an entrance and exit from Riverside.

801
00:56:26,762 --> 00:56:30,684
[SPEAKER_05]: The issue was going into the stop and shop in Fells Plaza.

802
00:56:31,345 --> 00:56:34,446
[SPEAKER_05]: We fought to get the additional entrance slash exit going in there.

803
00:56:35,047 --> 00:56:36,707
[SPEAKER_07]: And Ocean State people agreed to let them use it.

804
00:56:36,727 --> 00:56:37,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, and then to go out onto commercial.

805
00:56:37,988 --> 00:56:51,636
[SPEAKER_05]: And then long term, I believe it was Councillor Marks or Councillor Penta, asked that to look into the feasibility of having a, what did you call it at the time, right turn only onto the Fellsway.

806
00:56:51,936 --> 00:56:54,237
[SPEAKER_05]: So that you wouldn't even have to stop at a light.

807
00:56:56,395 --> 00:56:56,695
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

808
00:56:56,715 --> 00:56:58,556
[SPEAKER_14]: This is not a motion for approval by council.

809
00:56:58,576 --> 00:56:59,937
[SPEAKER_14]: KVL seconded by council.

810
00:57:00,177 --> 00:57:05,759
[SPEAKER_19]: So all those in favor of a copy of the records, you can get a copy of the records.

811
00:57:05,779 --> 00:57:06,520
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

812
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:12,383
[SPEAKER_14]: The chairman will, uh, the clerk will, uh, forward the official document on the matter.

813
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,583
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor.

814
00:57:13,703 --> 00:57:13,963
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

815
00:57:14,424 --> 00:57:15,224
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed.

816
00:57:15,624 --> 00:57:17,825

00:57:50,539 --> 00:57:51,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

825
00:57:51,673 --> 00:57:53,454
[SPEAKER_14]: And we give the floor to Councilor Caviello.

826
00:57:53,594 --> 00:57:54,295
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

827
00:57:54,775 --> 00:57:57,437
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I have reviewed the records again, and I find them in order.

828
00:57:58,197 --> 00:58:02,240
[SPEAKER_07]: If you could give us a little, I don't think many people know about noodles.

829
00:58:02,260 --> 00:58:04,522
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you tell us a little bit about noodles and what they're going to be?

830
00:58:05,783 --> 00:58:07,984
[SPEAKER_07]: I think people think it's an Asian restaurant, but it's really not.

831
00:58:08,324 --> 00:58:09,825
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen some of your other establishments.

832
00:58:11,146 --> 00:58:11,527
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

833
00:58:11,547 --> 00:58:14,729
[SPEAKER_21]: We're actually new to the New England area.

834
00:58:14,749 --> 00:58:19,012
[SPEAKER_21]: This will be our fifth one in the New England area, fourth in

835
00:58:20,132 --> 00:58:20,992
[SPEAKER_21]: fourth in Massachusetts.

836
00:58:21,012 --> 00:58:28,394
[SPEAKER_21]: We have one up in, in Nashua currently, uh, currently right now, basically, uh, it's, uh, we call it noodles, your world kitchen.

837
00:58:28,414 --> 00:58:42,037
[SPEAKER_21]: So basically you can get pastas from a different variety from the Mediterranean, from Asian, from, uh, American fair, as well as, uh, soups and, uh, some sandwiches and salads as an example of the menu I've, we're passing around to you right now.

838
00:58:43,477 --> 00:58:45,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, that's another welcome addition to the community.

839
00:58:47,002 --> 00:58:50,403
[SPEAKER_07]: Will this establishment be serving beer and wine or any alcohol?

840
00:58:50,423 --> 00:58:51,123
[SPEAKER_07]: Beer and wine, yes.

841
00:58:51,283 --> 00:58:52,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you applied for your license there?

842
00:58:52,783 --> 00:58:54,124
[SPEAKER_07]: We're working on that right now.

843
00:58:54,444 --> 00:58:56,824
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I wish you guys nothing but the best.

844
00:58:56,844 --> 00:59:01,145
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have a date for when this is looking at opening?

845
00:59:01,265 --> 00:59:05,606
[SPEAKER_21]: So they're looking to turn the base building over to us in July when we'd start construction.

846
00:59:05,686 --> 00:59:09,507
[SPEAKER_21]: So we would open about 11, 12 weeks after that.

847
00:59:09,627 --> 00:59:10,327
[SPEAKER_21]: So somewhere in the fall?

848
00:59:10,928 --> 00:59:15,412
[SPEAKER_21]: So it would be definitely be this fall and we would do them both Panera and noodles while probably simultaneously.

849
00:59:15,472 --> 00:59:17,674
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, let's say, uh, you'll be, you'll be a welcome addition to the community.

850
00:59:18,094 --> 00:59:18,354
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

851
00:59:18,835 --> 00:59:20,296
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there a motion for approval?

852
00:59:20,336 --> 00:59:23,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Counselor motion for approval was seconded by council.

853
00:59:23,318 --> 00:59:26,701
[SPEAKER_19]: So did counselor Fenton wish to speak question?

854
00:59:26,881 --> 00:59:29,043
[SPEAKER_19]: You, your hours of operation is 7am to 11.

855
00:59:29,203 --> 00:59:31,305
[SPEAKER_19]: Are you coming in for extended hours or not?

856
00:59:31,625 --> 00:59:34,968
[SPEAKER_21]: So the Panera is 7am to 11am.

857
00:59:36,329 --> 00:59:36,589
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry.

858
00:59:36,830 --> 00:59:39,712
[SPEAKER_21]: The Panera is 7am to 11pm currently, right?

859
00:59:40,018 --> 00:59:43,701
[SPEAKER_21]: but we will come in for additional hours and request to hope to open at 5 a.m.

860
00:59:44,061 --> 00:59:47,443
[SPEAKER_21]: The noodles and company will only be open from 11 a.m.

861
00:59:47,503 --> 00:59:48,624
[SPEAKER_21]: till about 11 p.m.

862
00:59:48,644 --> 00:59:48,964
[SPEAKER_21]: as well.

863
00:59:50,525 --> 00:59:51,746
[SPEAKER_21]: So the noodles will not open early.

864
00:59:51,786 --> 00:59:57,710
[SPEAKER_21]: Just the Panera or not require additional hours.

865
01:00:01,473 --> 01:00:01,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually,

866
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:06,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Through the chair, I was gonna ask about the timeframe too, but Councilor Carviel already asked.

867
01:00:07,332 --> 01:00:15,316
[SPEAKER_03]: What about a filtration system on top of noodles or will that one system take care of all three?

868
01:00:15,976 --> 01:00:16,956
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, we haven't looked at it.

869
01:00:17,036 --> 01:00:26,740
[SPEAKER_21]: We have 11 currently operating noodles and company and we have not experienced really any odor because we don't have any grease fryers or anything of that nature.

870
01:00:28,581 --> 01:00:30,222
[SPEAKER_21]: So there hasn't been a conversation around that.

871
01:00:32,957 --> 01:00:38,578
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it became a problem for the neighbors, would you be willing to, I mean, what's the avenue to request that?

872
01:00:38,918 --> 01:00:42,399
[SPEAKER_21]: So, um, well, there's two avenues.

873
01:00:42,439 --> 01:00:45,740
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a, there's a, there's a very, very, very expensive avenue.

874
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:52,501
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, and, but we would set ourselves up in case something did, something did arise where we could address something and, you know, after the fact.

875
01:00:52,701 --> 01:00:55,641
[SPEAKER_21]: So is there any build out that would have to be done prior to, that's what I mean.

876
01:00:55,681 --> 01:00:56,662
[SPEAKER_21]: We would set something up.

877
01:00:56,682 --> 01:00:58,242
[SPEAKER_21]: So just in case, but yes.

878
01:00:58,672 --> 01:01:01,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, just make that a condition that something is set up.

879
01:01:01,593 --> 01:01:06,395
[SPEAKER_03]: So if need be, filtration system is needed, that it's there, it's ready.

880
01:01:09,496 --> 01:01:19,259
[SPEAKER_09]: On smash burgers, as opposed to a recommendation, if they agreed to, you know, that's what I mean.

881
01:01:19,299 --> 01:01:26,082
[SPEAKER_09]: They, they would have, they just make it, they agreed that they would recommendation on a special permit.

882
01:01:26,102 --> 01:01:27,442
[SPEAKER_14]: You couldn't put the condition on that.

883
01:01:27,737 --> 01:01:29,218
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a recommendation then, I think.

884
01:01:29,338 --> 01:01:51,354
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to be clear about this, that the counselor, uh, vice president, uh, is making a recommendation that in your build out that you adapt your, uh, HVAC systems to, uh, accept the possibility of needing charcoal filtration as you've done with an era and your drive through.

885
01:01:51,694 --> 01:01:51,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

886
01:01:52,375 --> 01:01:52,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

887
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:56,401
[SPEAKER_03]: We did it for all three.

888
01:01:57,361 --> 01:01:59,063
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think we did it for noodles.

889
01:01:59,123 --> 01:02:01,665
[SPEAKER_21]: We had to do it separately with the hamburgers.

890
01:02:01,745 --> 01:02:04,707
[SPEAKER_21]: From what I heard from the landlord, it was the Panera was the charcoal.

891
01:02:05,127 --> 01:02:07,289
[SPEAKER_21]: It was this full system for smash burger.

892
01:02:07,309 --> 01:02:08,570
[SPEAKER_21]: And there was no comment from noodles.

893
01:02:08,610 --> 01:02:09,631
[SPEAKER_21]: At least that's what she had told me.

894
01:02:10,251 --> 01:02:12,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd make that recommendation, please.

895
01:02:13,193 --> 01:02:18,877
[SPEAKER_14]: So as a motion for approval as recommended, all those in favor.

896
01:02:19,238 --> 01:02:19,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

897
01:02:19,898 --> 01:02:20,559
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed.

898
01:02:22,231 --> 01:02:24,212
[SPEAKER_21]: Congratulations, your license is granted.

899
01:02:24,232 --> 01:02:24,672
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

900
01:02:24,773 --> 01:02:25,993
[SPEAKER_21]: I just have one question.

901
01:02:26,334 --> 01:02:29,936
[SPEAKER_21]: As far as outdoor dining licenses, is there a hearing?

902
01:02:30,096 --> 01:02:32,437
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry, obviously I've said something.

903
01:02:32,657 --> 01:02:33,978
[SPEAKER_21]: You should have come here last week.

904
01:02:33,998 --> 01:02:36,200
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, boy.

905
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:37,120
[SPEAKER_03]: You can apply.

906
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:38,941
[SPEAKER_03]: You can apply.

907
01:02:39,001 --> 01:02:41,603
[SPEAKER_03]: You just come back in front of the council.

908
01:02:43,024 --> 01:02:43,324
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

909
01:02:43,464 --> 01:02:45,905
[SPEAKER_14]: And the Board of Health has guidelines regarding that.

910
01:02:48,067 --> 01:02:48,307
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

911
01:02:53,233 --> 01:03:16,297
[SPEAKER_14]: And as you prepare your site for that, maybe it would be helpful to know that the council has had concerns regarding noise generation at later hours in open-air dining areas, as well as concern for safety, lighting, and that those fixtures be designed in a way.

912
01:03:16,337 --> 01:03:22,878
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you have nowadays ADA requirements there, but this concern that people

913
01:03:23,449 --> 01:03:33,193
[SPEAKER_14]: not gain access to those areas when the stores are closed or when dining has ceased at one establishment and not the other, et cetera.

914
01:03:33,613 --> 01:03:34,053
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, correct.

915
01:03:34,073 --> 01:03:37,494
[SPEAKER_21]: So at the end of each night, we would stack the furniture and it would get locked up.

916
01:03:37,935 --> 01:03:38,955
[SPEAKER_21]: Something like that, yeah.

917
01:03:38,995 --> 01:03:40,536
[SPEAKER_21]: Now with the noodles, it's a little bit different.

918
01:03:40,556 --> 01:03:45,057
[SPEAKER_21]: At the noodles we have, or we're proposing, at the noodles, a gated area.

919
01:03:47,058 --> 01:03:48,219
[SPEAKER_21]: So that would be enclosed.

920
01:03:48,419 --> 01:03:51,520
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, you could obviously exit, but it would be in a closed area.

921
01:03:52,816 --> 01:03:53,136
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

922
01:03:53,936 --> 01:03:54,297
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

923
01:03:54,397 --> 01:03:55,117
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.

924
01:03:55,297 --> 01:03:55,797
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks very much.

925
01:03:55,817 --> 01:03:56,397
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

926
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:56,718
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

927
01:03:56,858 --> 01:03:57,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Good luck.

928
01:03:57,698 --> 01:03:59,079
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

929
01:03:59,099 --> 01:04:12,304
[SPEAKER_14]: 15 dash three 24 petition for class one auto dealers license by Lawrence M Gordon, president of colonial Volkswagen incorporated for colonial VW of Medford three 40 mystic Avenue, Medford mass.

930
01:04:12,384 --> 01:04:14,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, two one five five, sir.

931
01:04:14,945 --> 01:04:15,665
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you Mr. Gordon?

932
01:04:16,365 --> 01:04:20,827
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Brian Lafferty from Colonial Automotive Group, 626 Main Street in Concord, Mass.

933
01:04:22,127 --> 01:04:23,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for entertaining our license.

934
01:04:23,708 --> 01:04:28,969
[SPEAKER_08]: As the city council knows, I believe we're going to be moving our Volkswagen agency down to the new facility.

935
01:04:29,670 --> 01:04:40,273
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully we're going to be open in a couple of weeks and the existing facility is probably going to, we're probably going to move one or other franchises into the existing facility.

936
01:04:40,855 --> 01:04:46,761
[SPEAKER_08]: So the operation at the new building will be essentially what was going on at the current Volkswagen facility.

937
01:04:48,102 --> 01:04:48,462
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

938
01:04:49,063 --> 01:04:54,428
[SPEAKER_14]: So chair, uh, recognizes, uh, councilor Caviello, chairman of licensing for recommendations.

939
01:04:54,468 --> 01:04:57,771
[SPEAKER_07]: President, I have reviewed the paperwork and I find it, uh, on an order.

940
01:04:57,832 --> 01:05:00,674
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, again, you guys did an excellent job in the building.

941
01:05:01,095 --> 01:05:02,136
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice addition to the Avenue.

942
01:05:02,176 --> 01:05:02,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean,

943
01:05:02,887 --> 01:05:03,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

944
01:05:03,347 --> 01:05:03,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

945
01:05:03,627 --> 01:05:07,068
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate the council saying that we really enjoyed doing business in Medford.

946
01:05:07,128 --> 01:05:07,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

947
01:05:07,288 --> 01:05:09,708
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys have been good neighbors and no, we appreciate it.

948
01:05:09,768 --> 01:05:14,169
[SPEAKER_07]: The city has been very good to us and they did an outstanding job with the property and thank you.

949
01:05:14,209 --> 01:05:14,589
[SPEAKER_14]: Good luck.

950
01:05:14,769 --> 01:05:15,789
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate it.

951
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:16,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

952
01:05:16,969 --> 01:05:17,269
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

953
01:05:17,530 --> 01:05:21,470
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion for approval by councilor Caraviello, council Camuso.

954
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:21,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

955
01:05:21,810 --> 01:05:24,691
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd just like to also comment on the, the build out of the property.

956
01:05:25,431 --> 01:05:31,992
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you look back a few years ago and Mr. Gav, when you first entered Medford before century bank was there, it was just the old building, a century bank.

957
01:05:33,241 --> 01:05:36,504
[SPEAKER_05]: next door, it was wide open, it was a truck place.

958
01:05:37,164 --> 01:05:39,166
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you guys did an unbelievable build.

959
01:05:39,486 --> 01:05:41,088
[SPEAKER_05]: I especially like the little wall out front.

960
01:05:41,468 --> 01:05:43,070
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of character and it's just a great escape.

961
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:44,751
[SPEAKER_08]: A little wall's a quarter of a million dollars.

962
01:05:44,971 --> 01:05:45,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, a little wall.

963
01:05:46,553 --> 01:05:47,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Marshall challenged us.

964
01:05:48,034 --> 01:05:55,961
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a meeting in the beginning when they heard about it and he kind of challenged us to do well for that part of the city.

965
01:05:56,022 --> 01:05:57,283
[SPEAKER_05]: He gave you an interest free loan.

966
01:05:58,497 --> 01:05:59,937
[SPEAKER_08]: No, he doesn't give anything away.

967
01:06:00,278 --> 01:06:06,199
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I just, I just, seriously, it's a great, it's a great addition to the neighborhood.

968
01:06:06,639 --> 01:06:15,242
[SPEAKER_05]: And especially now, too, if another, if you do move your franchise over to the other building, you'll be doing more updating, I'm assuming.

969
01:06:15,522 --> 01:06:17,042
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll have to redo that facility, too.

970
01:06:17,062 --> 01:06:19,643
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're looking at, we're looking at potentially two brand new

971
01:06:20,677 --> 01:06:24,159
[SPEAKER_05]: state-of-the-art auto sale places on Mr. Gav.

972
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:26,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you throw in a couple of the Graverones.

973
01:06:26,259 --> 01:06:29,881
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, Medford really is becoming... We did have a Nissan facility a couple of years ago.

974
01:06:30,441 --> 01:06:32,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, the motorcycle dealership, the Nissan dealership.

975
01:06:33,202 --> 01:06:36,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Gav really is becoming like the quarter-of-a-mile zone.

976
01:06:36,944 --> 01:06:39,385
[SPEAKER_05]: They get the auto mile, we're like the auto quarter-of-a-mile.

977
01:06:39,425 --> 01:06:41,806
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not there yet, but... Which one?

978
01:06:43,287 --> 01:06:44,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Physical therapist, yes.

979
01:06:46,188 --> 01:06:46,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Did he get his sign?

980
01:06:48,509 --> 01:06:48,809
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

981
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:54,444
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, but seriously, Mr. Gavrelli is on the rise.

982
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:57,046
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the China, I don't mean to digress, Mr. President.

983
01:06:57,547 --> 01:07:03,332
[SPEAKER_05]: A few years ago, this council took a bold vote to move forward the development of Dragon Villa, and look at it today.

984
01:07:03,812 --> 01:07:10,818
[SPEAKER_05]: It's bustling with harrows, and at the time, there was some neighborhood opposition, but the council did what they felt was right, and look at it today.

985
01:07:11,098 --> 01:07:15,422
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we're all there in the parking lot meeting.

986
01:07:15,862 --> 01:07:16,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Good luck.

987
01:07:18,278 --> 01:07:18,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

988
01:07:18,558 --> 01:07:24,881
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion of President Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Camuso.

989
01:07:24,901 --> 01:07:25,601

01:07:25,881 --> 01:07:26,121
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

991
01:07:26,462 --> 01:07:27,282

[SPEAKER_14]: License granted.

993
01:07:28,483 --> 01:07:29,223
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.

994
01:07:29,463 --> 01:07:29,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

995
01:07:29,963 --> 01:07:30,543
[SPEAKER_14]: Appreciate it.

996
01:07:30,583 --> 01:07:30,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Good luck.

997
01:07:30,904 --> 01:07:32,664
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

998
01:07:33,045 --> 01:07:33,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to revert.

999
01:07:34,205 --> 01:07:34,545
[SPEAKER_07]: We can take 15.312.

1000
01:07:34,605 --> 01:07:37,086
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion of Chairman Caraviello to take 15-312 off the table.

1001
01:07:37,206 --> 01:07:39,928
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1002
01:07:48,738 --> 01:07:49,379
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1003
01:07:49,979 --> 01:07:50,900
[SPEAKER_14]: Motions before us.

1004
01:07:50,920 --> 01:08:02,188
[SPEAKER_14]: 15-312 was tabled last week because there was some, uh, for unity cab, uh, was tabled last week because, uh, uh, their absence from a subcommittee meeting.

1005
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:04,710
[SPEAKER_14]: They were present, I think, this evening.

1006
01:08:04,730 --> 01:08:06,231
[SPEAKER_14]: They were present this evening, Mr. President.

1007
01:08:06,291 --> 01:08:08,913
[SPEAKER_14]: And so the paper is before us to change licenses.

1008
01:08:09,333 --> 01:08:10,954
[SPEAKER_07]: To upgrade, upgrade a car.

1009
01:08:11,335 --> 01:08:11,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

1010
01:08:12,315 --> 01:08:15,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I reviewed the paperwork, Mr. President, and I find an order, a motion for approval.

1011
01:08:16,312 --> 01:08:20,036
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion for approval by Councilor Caviello, all those in favor?

1012
01:08:21,037 --> 01:08:21,798
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1013
01:08:22,439 --> 01:08:23,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion carries.

1014
01:08:23,180 --> 01:08:23,941
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.

1015
01:08:23,961 --> 01:08:29,747
[SPEAKER_14]: You can go ahead and move your cabbie medallion from one car to the other.

1016
01:08:29,807 --> 01:08:32,590
[SPEAKER_09]: It has to get it certified from weights and measures.

1017
01:08:35,162 --> 01:08:35,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Brooks.

1018
01:08:36,503 --> 01:08:36,703
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

1019
01:08:36,723 --> 01:08:37,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1020
01:08:37,683 --> 01:08:42,986
[SPEAKER_14]: So long as you're in compliance with the regulations overseen by the city clerk.

1021
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:44,526
[SPEAKER_14]: So congratulations.

1022
01:08:44,587 --> 01:08:45,067
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1023
01:08:45,127 --> 01:08:45,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Drive safely.

1024
01:08:45,867 --> 01:08:46,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Two hands.

1025
01:08:46,988 --> 01:08:47,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1026
01:08:48,148 --> 01:08:48,608
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

1027
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:57,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we referring back to the order of regular order of business by councilor Camuso?

1028
01:08:57,432 --> 01:08:58,233
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor.

1029
01:08:58,253 --> 01:09:00,334
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed.

1030
01:09:00,354 --> 01:09:02,615
[SPEAKER_14]: 15 dash three one nine offered by councilor Knight.

1031
01:09:03,626 --> 01:09:12,692
[SPEAKER_14]: be it resolved that the Park Commission lift any and all prohibitions concerning the playing of street hockey in our public parks.

1032
01:09:14,313 --> 01:09:14,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Councillor.

1033
01:09:15,354 --> 01:09:16,575
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1034
01:09:16,615 --> 01:09:24,740
[SPEAKER_10]: I was down La Conte hockey rink one evening and a number of young kids came up to me and I was talking to them about the game of hockey and whether or not they play street hockey.

1035
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:32,345
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of the things that came up was that they're not allowed to play street hockey in the tennis courts at Placetet Park, although Placetet Park is lined for street hockey.

1036
01:09:33,287 --> 01:09:35,809
[SPEAKER_10]: Which got me thinking, I said, well, why can't they?

1037
01:09:35,969 --> 01:09:38,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Has the park board put a prohibition in that's in place?

1038
01:09:38,311 --> 01:09:43,254
[SPEAKER_10]: And I did a little bit of research, and I don't see the park board actually taking an official action prohibiting such.

1039
01:09:43,654 --> 01:09:48,318
[SPEAKER_10]: However, there are signs up at the tennis courts that place the park.

1040
01:09:49,298 --> 01:09:55,783
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm sure that the reason that the signs went up was because of outcry of some of the neighbors, I would imagine.

1041
01:09:56,143 --> 01:10:01,987
[SPEAKER_10]: However, in this day and age, when we're sitting here looking at an opiate addiction problem in the city of Medford,

1042
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:14,653
[SPEAKER_10]: a childhood obesity problem across the United States of America, I think that keeping kids out of our parks and keeping kids out of our recreational areas to participate in organized and unorganized athletics, it may be misguided, Mr. President.

1043
01:10:14,673 --> 01:10:16,553
[SPEAKER_10]: It may not be the right policy.

1044
01:10:17,234 --> 01:10:26,976
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, I'd like to see if there are any prohibitions in place concerning the playing of street hockey in our public parks, what they are, why they're in place, and whether or not they make sense, because right now I don't think that they do.

1045
01:10:27,896 --> 01:10:28,296
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

1046
01:10:28,356 --> 01:10:31,057
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion, I must say that

1047
01:10:31,996 --> 01:10:36,818
[SPEAKER_14]: On my brief street hockey career in my youth, we used to play in the middle of Yale Street.

1048
01:10:38,098 --> 01:10:39,179
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think you get away with it now.

1049
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:40,819
[SPEAKER_14]: It was less traveled back then.

1050
01:10:45,581 --> 01:10:51,343
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of Councilor Knight to request clarification from the Park Board.

1051
01:10:51,623 --> 01:10:51,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Please.

1052
01:10:53,444 --> 01:10:54,444
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Longo-Curran.

1053
01:10:54,484 --> 01:10:55,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the Park Board and

1054
01:10:56,719 --> 01:11:02,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Director of Parks from DPW, Mike Nestor, maybe ask why those, I'm sure the Department of Public Works.

1055
01:11:02,942 --> 01:11:07,164
[SPEAKER_10]: I did ask Mike actually, he was the first person I spoke with about this and he said he's aware of no prohibition.

1056
01:11:08,105 --> 01:11:08,285
[SPEAKER_10]: Very good.

1057
01:11:08,645 --> 01:11:12,287
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, if we could just ask for history, why are there signs up then?

1058
01:11:13,327 --> 01:11:14,188
[SPEAKER_03]: There must be a reason.

1059
01:11:14,268 --> 01:11:15,348
[SPEAKER_03]: So I agree with you.

1060
01:11:15,388 --> 01:11:17,430
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I feel like our kids should be able to play.

1061
01:11:18,350 --> 01:11:24,173
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if there was any problems that had been caused in the past, but maybe if we can get some sort of update from anybody that may know.

1062
01:11:24,868 --> 01:11:26,969
[SPEAKER_03]: and then try to move forward and try to resolve the issue.

1063
01:11:27,970 --> 01:11:28,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President?

1064
01:11:28,871 --> 01:11:29,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Councillor Camuso.

1065
01:11:29,611 --> 01:11:45,042
[SPEAKER_05]: I will support sending this to the Traffic Commission for an answer, but there was a lot of opposition to the street hockey, particularly at Playstead Park, from the houses down the end of Century Street at the time, senior citizens and stuff, they were very vocal.

1066
01:11:45,442 --> 01:11:49,945
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's why those signs did go up, but I'll support at least getting an answer from the Traffic Commission.

1067
01:11:50,265 --> 01:11:50,685
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

1068
01:11:52,467 --> 01:11:52,867
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

1069
01:11:53,207 --> 01:11:54,588
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion, all those in favour?

1070
01:11:56,122 --> 01:11:56,782
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

1071
01:11:56,802 --> 01:11:59,964
[SPEAKER_14]: 15-320 offered by Councillor Knight.

1072
01:12:00,204 --> 01:12:02,204
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President, I withdraw the resolution at this point in time.

1073
01:12:03,505 --> 01:12:07,786
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councillor Knight to withdraw.

1074
01:12:09,067 --> 01:12:09,827
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to withdraw.

1075
01:12:10,187 --> 01:12:12,508
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1076
01:12:12,528 --> 01:12:14,549
[SPEAKER_14]: 15-321 offered by Councillor Penta.

1077
01:12:15,249 --> 01:12:21,771
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the City Council further review the Craddock Bridge Rehabilitation.

1078
01:12:22,191 --> 01:12:23,131
[SPEAKER_19]: Councillor Penta.

1079
01:12:23,592 --> 01:12:24,272
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President,

1080
01:12:25,498 --> 01:12:29,179
[SPEAKER_19]: This seems to be an ongoing saga that, well, it goes back many, many years.

1081
01:12:29,919 --> 01:12:53,865
[SPEAKER_19]: But just going back to January of this past year, strike that, January of 2014, we had received a public information bulletin that came out of the offices of Representative Donato and Senator Pat Jalen, indicating that after a long delay, and finally, money being put into the transportation bill, that the work on the aquatic bridge would be taking place.

1082
01:12:54,567 --> 01:12:57,649
[SPEAKER_19]: and the work was expected to begin in the spring of 2014.

1083
01:12:57,729 --> 01:13:01,911
[SPEAKER_19]: That was the press release that came out.

1084
01:13:02,952 --> 01:13:22,824
[SPEAKER_19]: Subsequent to that, and I brought up that same question again earlier this year, there was a subsequent report and a story that came out in our local press that basically, from our director of OCD, who basically said, they know what we're expecting, meaning Department of Transportation,

1085
01:13:23,374 --> 01:13:26,056
[SPEAKER_19]: We want communication with the people in our city.

1086
01:13:26,937 --> 01:13:39,447
[SPEAKER_19]: And at that point in time, DOT had made the comment of the following that the MassDOT project manager, Paul King, said, construction would take place day and night in order to finish the project in about two years.

1087
01:13:40,128 --> 01:13:43,030
[SPEAKER_19]: Night shifts will run from 10 or 10.30 p.m.

1088
01:13:43,070 --> 01:13:43,751
[SPEAKER_19]: to 6 a.m.

1089
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:45,292
[SPEAKER_19]: and day shifts from 6.30 a.m.

1090
01:13:45,332 --> 01:13:46,593
[SPEAKER_19]: to 7 a.m.

1091
01:13:46,733 --> 01:13:47,273
[SPEAKER_19]: to 3 p.m.

1092
01:13:49,812 --> 01:14:01,616
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, with that being said, and that was the report that just came out January 21st, 2015, a year after the fact, we had discussed this on the City Council.

1093
01:14:02,516 --> 01:14:09,758
[SPEAKER_19]: Then there was a letter here dated February 24th, 2015, just about a month after the January notice.

1094
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:18,441
[SPEAKER_19]: It says that the project is expected to complete within 1,300 calendar days from the receipt of the notice to proceed.

1095
01:14:19,478 --> 01:14:36,183
[SPEAKER_19]: and it states further, I encourage you to take advantage of this opportunity to reacquaint yourself with the project and ask that you share this invitation with the community's emergency service division and any other local officials or departments who may have any interest in this matter.

1096
01:14:36,943 --> 01:14:39,323
[SPEAKER_19]: That was a letter sent out on February 24th.

1097
01:14:40,364 --> 01:14:41,544
[SPEAKER_19]: We never got that letter.

1098
01:14:42,524 --> 01:14:45,285
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, your name is on the letter.

1099
01:14:45,365 --> 01:14:46,265
[SPEAKER_19]: You were C.C.'d.

1100
01:14:46,385 --> 01:14:48,366
[SPEAKER_19]: Paul Gere, Cassandra Cugliatos,

1101
01:14:50,151 --> 01:14:53,633
[SPEAKER_19]: Pat Jalen, Paul Donato, Sean Copley, and Christine Barber.

1102
01:14:54,554 --> 01:14:56,935
[SPEAKER_19]: Five elected officials got this letter.

1103
01:14:58,076 --> 01:15:00,097
[SPEAKER_19]: And we have yet to see it or hear or discuss it.

1104
01:15:01,198 --> 01:15:02,879
[SPEAKER_19]: And something is radically wrong.

1105
01:15:04,059 --> 01:15:05,400
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely radically wrong.

1106
01:15:05,460 --> 01:15:08,902
[SPEAKER_19]: I just cannot believe this council had this discussion in January.

1107
01:15:09,243 --> 01:15:10,163
[SPEAKER_19]: It was reported out.

1108
01:15:10,664 --> 01:15:17,968
[SPEAKER_19]: And then on February 24th, an official letter from DET in Boston with your name and four other elected representatives got this letter.

1109
01:15:18,750 --> 01:15:27,594
[SPEAKER_19]: indicating that the project is going to be complete within 1,300 calendar days from the receipt of the notice to proceed.

1110
01:15:27,914 --> 01:15:30,875
[SPEAKER_19]: That's number one.

1111
01:15:30,895 --> 01:15:31,776
[SPEAKER_19]: 1,300 calendar days.

1112
01:15:32,136 --> 01:15:34,417
[SPEAKER_19]: There's 365 days in a year.

1113
01:15:35,277 --> 01:15:41,260
[SPEAKER_19]: That comes out to three years and 56 days, if that's around the clock.

1114
01:15:41,480 --> 01:15:45,462
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you want to make it around the clock and double it up, it comes out to

1115
01:15:46,367 --> 01:15:52,209
[SPEAKER_19]: One year and 78 days, for which they won't do, because they've already told you what they're giving you for time schedule.

1116
01:15:53,150 --> 01:15:56,971
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I don't know why you didn't send it to us or get it.

1117
01:15:57,771 --> 01:15:58,432
[SPEAKER_19]: You're on here.

1118
01:15:58,492 --> 01:15:59,292
[SPEAKER_19]: You were CC'd.

1119
01:16:00,232 --> 01:16:01,833
[SPEAKER_19]: City administration was CC'd.

1120
01:16:02,913 --> 01:16:04,894
[SPEAKER_19]: The mayor was addressed to the mayor.

1121
01:16:05,274 --> 01:16:06,234
[SPEAKER_19]: We haven't received it.

1122
01:16:07,795 --> 01:16:08,635
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, the start date.

1123
01:16:08,695 --> 01:16:12,097
[SPEAKER_19]: And the start date is as soon as the intent to do, do, do, do.

1124
01:16:14,618 --> 01:16:15,598
[SPEAKER_19]: I will give you a copy of it.

1125
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:19,300
[SPEAKER_19]: Here's a copy for yourself.

1126
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:21,141
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1127
01:16:21,161 --> 01:16:21,441
[SPEAKER_19]: You're welcome.

1128
01:16:22,801 --> 01:16:29,503
[SPEAKER_19]: I just think that the business community in this city is getting shot change so bad, so bad.

1129
01:16:30,563 --> 01:16:34,164
[SPEAKER_19]: We as councils have been on top of this issue for months, if not years.

1130
01:16:34,465 --> 01:16:40,126
[SPEAKER_19]: This started off as less than a $3 million project, and now they want to build a $13 million Taj Mahal bridge.

1131
01:16:40,446 --> 01:16:42,687
[SPEAKER_19]: It's only nothing more than 121 feet.

1132
01:16:43,427 --> 01:16:46,248
[SPEAKER_19]: And to tie up the business community in this city of Medford

1133
01:16:47,098 --> 01:16:53,122
[SPEAKER_19]: to tie them up for well in excess of, never mind one year, two years, or three years, whatever it might be, to do what?

1134
01:16:53,863 --> 01:16:54,924
[SPEAKER_19]: What are they building here?

1135
01:16:55,384 --> 01:16:57,305
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not asking for anything outrageous.

1136
01:16:57,766 --> 01:17:00,548
[SPEAKER_19]: Just go in there and take care of the bridge the way it is.

1137
01:17:00,868 --> 01:17:05,671
[SPEAKER_19]: This isn't the Longfellow Bridge that they're spending millions and millions of dollars.

1138
01:17:05,731 --> 01:17:08,814
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a simple little bridge of 121 feet.

1139
01:17:09,614 --> 01:17:11,716
[SPEAKER_19]: And with the technology that's out there today,

1140
01:17:13,355 --> 01:17:25,373
[SPEAKER_19]: But the technology that's out there today, and to say that it would take at least a year, at least a year if they wanted to even think about changing the conduits for the electric, the telephone, the gas, that's preposterous.

1141
01:17:26,294 --> 01:17:29,779
[SPEAKER_19]: We can go to the moon and back with a simple little phone and you can talk to someone.

1142
01:17:30,649 --> 01:17:32,010
[SPEAKER_19]: You did the FAST-14.

1143
01:17:32,370 --> 01:17:33,952
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure, the bridges were built ahead of time.

1144
01:17:34,612 --> 01:17:35,493
[SPEAKER_19]: But this isn't a FAST-14.

1145
01:17:35,873 --> 01:17:43,180
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you read the whole thing, and it basically tells you, if you want to acquaint yourself with, what's there to be acquainted with?

1146
01:17:43,540 --> 01:17:44,801
[SPEAKER_19]: Shutting down businesses?

1147
01:17:46,042 --> 01:17:49,125
[SPEAKER_19]: The mayor of this community got this letter on February 24th.

1148
01:17:49,765 --> 01:17:51,927
[SPEAKER_19]: This council discussed it in January.

1149
01:17:52,508 --> 01:17:57,212
[SPEAKER_19]: The director of OCD said there has to be communication between all parties involved.

1150
01:17:58,131 --> 01:17:59,492
[SPEAKER_19]: All three things have taken place.

1151
01:18:00,013 --> 01:18:02,395
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor De La Ruza, whether you got the letter or not, I don't know.

1152
01:18:02,936 --> 01:18:09,843
[SPEAKER_19]: But five other elected officials got it, and none of us, not one of us, have been informed about this change in the process.

1153
01:18:11,397 --> 01:18:12,638
[SPEAKER_19]: 1300 calendar days.

1154
01:18:13,278 --> 01:18:13,839
[SPEAKER_19]: Figure it out.

1155
01:18:14,339 --> 01:18:20,042
[SPEAKER_19]: Around the clock, 24 hours a day, divided by 365, comes up to three years and 56 days.

1156
01:18:20,422 --> 01:18:25,764
[SPEAKER_19]: And if you want to double up the days and you give them good measure, it comes out to one year and seven.

1157
01:18:25,945 --> 01:18:26,645
[SPEAKER_19]: It will never happen.

1158
01:18:26,925 --> 01:18:30,227
[SPEAKER_19]: The cost of the overtime will be a killer for this bridge.

1159
01:18:31,007 --> 01:18:36,610
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. Mayor, I'm asking you, Mr. President, I'm asking you to call for the Department of Transportation.

1160
01:18:36,630 --> 01:18:39,031
[SPEAKER_19]: The fellow's name is Paul Stedman.

1161
01:18:39,499 --> 01:18:51,204
[SPEAKER_19]: He's the acting district highway director to appear before this council and explain, one, why we were never apprised of the letter and the information enclosed.

1162
01:18:51,764 --> 01:19:02,388
[SPEAKER_19]: And I want him to tell the people in this community when, in fact, that bridge construction is going to take place so every single business merchant that might be affected will know about it.

1163
01:19:02,689 --> 01:19:08,251
[SPEAKER_19]: And also, I don't want to hear the excuse that no mitigation is going to be provided for in this construction period.

1164
01:19:09,101 --> 01:19:21,848
[SPEAKER_19]: Those are his three tasks, those are the three things, Councilor, Mr. President, and I would have hoped that my council colleagues would vote unanimously on a roll call vote and send that to him because this is just completely out of control, out of control.

1165
01:19:23,132 --> 01:19:27,376
[SPEAKER_19]: You have elected people coming in here telling you one thing, having press releases go out.

1166
01:19:27,616 --> 01:19:32,801
[SPEAKER_19]: You have newspaper articles dating back to January of 2014 telling you it's going to start.

1167
01:19:33,001 --> 01:19:34,843
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been hearing this for years.

1168
01:19:35,343 --> 01:19:35,903
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's since 2000.

1169
01:19:36,564 --> 01:19:38,666
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it was you, counsel, a long ago.

1170
01:19:38,686 --> 01:19:39,326
[SPEAKER_19]: I think I brought it up.

1171
01:19:39,346 --> 01:19:40,247
[SPEAKER_19]: It was you, 2007.

1172
01:19:41,048 --> 01:19:42,289
[SPEAKER_19]: We talked about the Craddock Bridge.

1173
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:47,696
[SPEAKER_19]: and you brought up, you just wanted an update as it related to the structure and the safety and the concern of the bridge.

1174
01:19:49,018 --> 01:19:53,101
[SPEAKER_19]: That bridge has been there for well in excess of over 100 plus years.

1175
01:19:53,562 --> 01:19:55,183
[SPEAKER_19]: It's sitting on solid granite.

1176
01:19:55,243 --> 01:19:56,144
[SPEAKER_19]: It hasn't sunk.

1177
01:19:56,404 --> 01:19:57,585
[SPEAKER_19]: It doesn't intend to sink.

1178
01:19:58,065 --> 01:20:00,648
[SPEAKER_19]: Why are we building a $13 million edifice?

1179
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:13,218
[SPEAKER_19]: What all we need is the road to be fixed so people can come and go to work and the business community in downtown does not have to be put aside or put out of business because I think that's exactly what would happen once this bridge closes.

1180
01:20:15,881 --> 01:20:17,862
[SPEAKER_14]: If I could just respond to that.

1181
01:20:17,962 --> 01:20:18,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1182
01:20:20,269 --> 01:20:25,993
[SPEAKER_14]: If I were in receipt of such a letter, I would have certainly forwarded it to the members of the council.

1183
01:20:26,674 --> 01:20:30,977
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, I cannot, uh, find it in my, uh, council briefing book.

1184
01:20:31,838 --> 01:20:38,743
[SPEAKER_14]: And, uh, I'm not aware of, uh, the clerk's not aware of, uh, well, if anything, it looks like it would have been addressed.

1185
01:20:39,044 --> 01:20:44,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, the overall point would have been addressed directly to your office if you do a proper procedure.

1186
01:20:44,908 --> 01:20:48,071
[SPEAKER_09]: So it didn't get addressed like Memphis city council.

1187
01:20:48,091 --> 01:20:49,612
[SPEAKER_09]: I would, then I would open it up and,

1188
01:20:50,618 --> 01:20:53,760
[SPEAKER_09]: made multiple copies, so if you could just address individually.

1189
01:20:53,900 --> 01:21:02,927
[SPEAKER_19]: But it was, Mr. Clerk, it was addressed to our Council President, State Senator Jalen, Representative Donato, Representative Garibaldi, and Representative Barber.

1190
01:21:03,067 --> 01:21:07,730
[SPEAKER_19]: And not one of them ever responded to the content of this notice.

1191
01:21:08,571 --> 01:21:10,912
[SPEAKER_19]: We had our conversation in January on the Council floor.

1192
01:21:11,252 --> 01:21:12,093
[SPEAKER_19]: It was reported out.

1193
01:21:12,894 --> 01:21:14,835
[SPEAKER_19]: Nothing, nothing like this was reported to us.

1194
01:21:15,235 --> 01:21:16,576
[SPEAKER_19]: And this came out on February 24th.

1195
01:21:16,656 --> 01:21:19,138
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, but he's asking me if he

1196
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:20,820
[SPEAKER_19]: if I received his letter.

1197
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:22,441
[SPEAKER_19]: You wouldn't receive his letter.

1198
01:21:22,461 --> 01:21:23,521
[SPEAKER_19]: You're not Fred DelaRusso.

1199
01:21:23,561 --> 01:21:24,081
[SPEAKER_19]: He's Fred DelaRusso.

1200
01:21:24,101 --> 01:21:25,021
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm trying to tell you.

1201
01:21:25,041 --> 01:21:28,602
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what I'm trying to tell you.

1202
01:21:28,622 --> 01:21:31,503
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't receive it directly.

1203
01:21:31,523 --> 01:21:33,623
[SPEAKER_19]: You call that guy tomorrow.

1204
01:21:33,643 --> 01:21:34,164
[SPEAKER_19]: You just tell him.

1205
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:48,467
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to schedule a meeting and invite him, request his presence before us to update the council on the project, to address the issues of mitigation, which Councilor Penta has exercised leadership on.

1206
01:21:49,283 --> 01:21:58,369
[SPEAKER_14]: and to address the subsequent issues, particularly around the length of time of the project and its effect on the business community.

1207
01:21:59,670 --> 01:22:00,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Councillor Knight.

1208
01:22:01,431 --> 01:22:02,672
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1209
01:22:03,272 --> 01:22:07,015
[SPEAKER_10]: Several weeks ago, we put a resolution forward relative to the Craddock Bridge.

1210
01:22:08,266 --> 01:22:25,580
[SPEAKER_10]: working with our state delegation to coordinate the release of some bonded funds that were attained in the transportation bond bill, so that when construction on the Craddock Bridge begins, we don't have to wait another 50 years for the lights at Main Street and South Street to get fixed.

1211
01:22:26,201 --> 01:22:33,667
[SPEAKER_10]: And in my attempts to speak with some officials from MassDOT after

1212
01:22:34,442 --> 01:22:43,286
[SPEAKER_10]: sending an email to an individual over there to ask for an update on the Craddock Bridge, and he sent me an email back saying, send me an email to remind me, which was just crazy to me.

1213
01:22:45,007 --> 01:22:47,548
[SPEAKER_10]: It was brought to my attention that they're looking to start before the end of this month.

1214
01:22:50,169 --> 01:22:55,951
[SPEAKER_10]: But when I followed up with some individuals in the DPW, they said, there's no way this project can start by the end of this month.

1215
01:22:56,011 --> 01:22:59,493
[SPEAKER_10]: So I certainly think that there is a huge communication gap here.

1216
01:23:00,425 --> 01:23:08,088
[SPEAKER_10]: There is definitely a problem with the top-down communication from the super agency that we call MassDOT in the city of Medford, Mr. President.

1217
01:23:08,148 --> 01:23:10,708
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think that Councilor Pente is right on track with this one.

1218
01:23:10,768 --> 01:23:17,030
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to get somebody down here to fill us in on what's going on so that we can plan accordingly and move accordingly so that we can get done what we need to get done.

1219
01:23:17,831 --> 01:23:25,473
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I think it's very important that these lights are addressed at the same time that the construction is addressed, that the bonded funding is addressed at the same time the construction is addressed.

1220
01:23:26,022 --> 01:23:31,223
[SPEAKER_10]: And if the construction's coming out, and it's going to stop by the end of this month, I think that we really need to get rolling on this, Mr. President.

1221
01:23:31,243 --> 01:23:35,864
[SPEAKER_10]: So I applaud Councilor Penta for bringing the issue forward, and he has my support on the resolution.

1222
01:23:36,444 --> 01:23:42,526
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're going to call this guy and have him come in?

1223
01:23:42,606 --> 01:23:43,386
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caviello.

1224
01:23:43,546 --> 01:23:44,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1225
01:23:44,306 --> 01:23:46,586
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of approval by Councilor Loco-Kern.

1226
01:23:48,387 --> 01:23:48,987
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1227
01:23:49,127 --> 01:23:53,788
[SPEAKER_07]: I attended most of the meetings with Councilor Penta, and one of the biggest concerns was even to

1228
01:23:54,707 --> 01:24:05,073
[SPEAKER_07]: La Rondiz Rondo was communication, that there was minimal communication between the DOT and the OCD office on where this was going.

1229
01:24:05,093 --> 01:24:06,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, when was the last time we had a meeting, about a year ago?

1230
01:24:08,435 --> 01:24:10,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Carol's Diner, we had a meeting about a year ago.

1231
01:24:10,496 --> 01:24:11,917
[SPEAKER_07]: That was the last thing we heard.

1232
01:24:12,657 --> 01:24:20,802
[SPEAKER_07]: I heard that they were going to put the spring, the temporary bridge was supposed to be put up, and the ramp was going to be closed because they already have signs

1233
01:24:21,345 --> 01:24:23,166
[SPEAKER_07]: saying that the ramp is going to be closed soon.

1234
01:24:23,826 --> 01:24:34,490
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but I haven't seen no mention of anything else, but again, um, we should have had some kind of meeting with the DOT, uh, just to keep us abreast of what's going on with this.

1235
01:24:35,491 --> 01:24:38,352
[SPEAKER_07]: And I say, yeah, a year that it's just the ridiculous.

1236
01:24:38,412 --> 01:24:43,354
[SPEAKER_07]: And I say, councilor Penta gets a letter that everyone else got that we know nothing about.

1237
01:24:44,835 --> 01:24:45,395
[SPEAKER_07]: Not acceptable.

1238
01:24:46,135 --> 01:24:48,436
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that letter published that you have?

1239
01:24:49,177 --> 01:24:50,097
[SPEAKER_07]: How did you get that letter?

1240
01:24:56,670 --> 01:25:06,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that why I didn't get it?

1241
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:15,924
[SPEAKER_07]: But like I said, it's been a year since we've had any contact with the state on where this is going.

1242
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:21,969
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think at that time they said that they were going to get it done in less than two and a half years.

1243
01:25:22,379 --> 01:25:27,463
[SPEAKER_07]: It was going to be two shifts doing it to get it done quicker.

1244
01:25:27,483 --> 01:25:29,645
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that's still the case.

1245
01:25:30,205 --> 01:25:30,906
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems it, right?

1246
01:25:32,987 --> 01:25:35,089
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going back to one shift.

1247
01:25:36,530 --> 01:25:38,832
[SPEAKER_07]: At that time, it was supposed to be a double shift to cut off a year.

1248
01:25:41,674 --> 01:25:44,897
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, I think the DOT— We really don't know.

1249
01:25:44,917 --> 01:25:45,257
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't know.

1250
01:25:45,317 --> 01:25:47,379
[SPEAKER_19]: It started at $3 million, went to $13 million.

1251
01:25:47,739 --> 01:25:49,580
[SPEAKER_19]: Now they're saying it's $10 million.

1252
01:25:50,221 --> 01:25:51,642
[SPEAKER_19]: Who knows what this bridge is going to look like?

1253
01:25:51,953 --> 01:25:54,215
[SPEAKER_19]: And there was talk of them working 24 hours a week.

1254
01:25:54,255 --> 01:25:54,775
[SPEAKER_19]: Absolutely.

1255
01:25:54,795 --> 01:25:56,477
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, absolutely.

1256
01:25:56,797 --> 01:25:57,998
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Camuso.

1257
01:25:58,038 --> 01:25:58,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Two questions.

1258
01:25:58,858 --> 01:26:03,542
[SPEAKER_05]: The temporary bridge was supposed to go in prior to anything that was supposed to be the first piece of the puzzle.

1259
01:26:03,582 --> 01:26:04,523
[SPEAKER_05]: That's supposed to go in the spring.

1260
01:26:05,784 --> 01:26:06,865
[SPEAKER_05]: That's supposed to go in the spring.

1261
01:26:06,925 --> 01:26:07,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.

1262
01:26:07,605 --> 01:26:16,972
[SPEAKER_07]: So they've already, if you go by, you see the signs saying that the ramp is going to be closed by the spring on the 93 and on route 16.

1263
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:17,893
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1264
01:26:18,633 --> 01:26:21,175
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're notifying the trucks already.

1265
01:26:21,195 --> 01:26:25,638
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's going to be some kind of notices on 93 for the trucks not to get off there.

1266
01:26:25,978 --> 01:26:26,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1267
01:26:26,178 --> 01:26:31,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause then the trucks only option before was going down to the Meffitt square exit and now they can't go on route 16.

1268
01:26:31,742 --> 01:26:47,393
[SPEAKER_05]: And the second thing is I think we have to, um, given the construction that's going to take place, I think we have to look now, I think is the reasonable time period to start looking for a new location for the bus stop in front of the real estate and the restaurant.

1269
01:26:47,898 --> 01:26:55,564
[SPEAKER_05]: because certainly I don't want to have a bus stop around construction vehicles and there's going to be so much going on down there in that immediate area.

1270
01:26:56,004 --> 01:27:00,508
[SPEAKER_05]: People waiting for the bus should not have to be breathing in the diesel fuel exhaust and all that stuff.

1271
01:27:00,928 --> 01:27:05,031
[SPEAKER_05]: So if, um, if this city council, maybe that is, do we have a transportation subcommittee?

1272
01:27:06,072 --> 01:27:12,357
[SPEAKER_05]: If we can maybe send it to transportation to come up with a feasible relocation for the bus stop, um,

1273
01:27:14,001 --> 01:27:27,823
[SPEAKER_05]: that's in the immediate area, but definitely that bus stop has to be moved, I think, for public safety, as well as for convenience to the people that traverse that area during this magnificent construction project.

1274
01:27:29,724 --> 01:27:30,784
[SPEAKER_14]: Councillor Kerrio.

1275
01:27:30,844 --> 01:27:33,144
[SPEAKER_14]: If I'm not mistaken, Councillor Camuso.

1276
01:27:33,164 --> 01:27:35,225
[SPEAKER_07]: That's amended by Councillor Camuso.

1277
01:27:35,525 --> 01:27:41,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the bus stop was talked about at earlier meetings, and they were very objectionable to moving the bus stop at all.

1278
01:27:41,386 --> 01:27:42,206
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you know what?

1279
01:27:43,893 --> 01:27:51,256
[SPEAKER_05]: You are correct, but my philosophy is the council is the only authority that has the jurisdiction to move the bus stops.

1280
01:27:51,836 --> 01:28:01,020
[SPEAKER_05]: At the time, I was adamantly against moving the bus stop because of the people using it, many senior citizens, children, and other individuals.

1281
01:28:02,287 --> 01:28:10,233
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not gonna sit here and allow senior citizens to breathe in the fumes from trucks hauling out debris and backhoes and everything else.

1282
01:28:10,754 --> 01:28:14,797
[SPEAKER_05]: That's, as far as I'm concerned, we're just lining people up to get sick.

1283
01:28:16,318 --> 01:28:22,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Part of the objection was people were objecting to the extra amount of time it would take for the bus to go up and make the extra loop.

1284
01:28:22,283 --> 01:28:23,144
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well no one said that.

1285
01:28:23,184 --> 01:28:29,349
[SPEAKER_05]: We could possibly move it across the streets, closer to where the overpass is coming from Route 16, down to Route 16 from 93,

1286
01:28:30,974 --> 01:28:33,115
[SPEAKER_05]: On the other side, across from the police station, something.

1287
01:28:33,435 --> 01:28:40,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I certainly wouldn't want my wife or my grandmother or my son waiting for a bus within 20 feet of construction vehicles.

1288
01:28:42,581 --> 01:28:45,562
[SPEAKER_05]: The bridge is right there, and the bus stop's right there.

1289
01:28:45,622 --> 01:28:51,305
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the members of the council agree, I think we should start looking at this as a subcommittee to move it.

1290
01:28:51,546 --> 01:28:59,070
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'd like to get a roll call vote on that, Mr. President, and come up with a feasible solution for the users, but also for the MBTA

1291
01:29:00,870 --> 01:29:01,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Very good.

1292
01:29:01,791 --> 01:29:16,621
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of for amendment by Councillor Camuso to send it to the subcommittee on transportation to address the movement of the bus stop and alternate routes in alternate locations for that.

1293
01:29:17,561 --> 01:29:20,083
[SPEAKER_14]: And on the main motion of approval.

1294
01:29:20,143 --> 01:29:23,605
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we can do that.

1295
01:29:23,725 --> 01:29:23,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1296
01:29:24,786 --> 01:29:30,670
[SPEAKER_14]: We, I was waiting for, for that on that one in particular is waiting for

1297
01:29:31,962 --> 01:29:47,871
[SPEAKER_14]: This one on Main Street at the beginning of Main Street in the square, the one that Councillor Camuso mentions, because we received such resistance from the MBTA, because it required the changing of the routing of the buses, that's what made that difficult.

1298
01:29:48,451 --> 01:29:55,695
[SPEAKER_14]: This one in South Medford, I was just waiting word back from the solicitor on the property to do that.

1299
01:29:56,175 --> 01:30:00,978
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was waiting for word back from him only so we can just expedite it right here on the floor.

1300
01:30:03,190 --> 01:30:08,092
[SPEAKER_14]: So, on the motion for approval by Councilor Langel-Kern, as amended by Councilor Camuso.

1301
01:30:08,533 --> 01:30:09,413
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1302
01:30:09,473 --> 01:30:09,913
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call.

1303
01:30:09,973 --> 01:30:11,094
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call has been requested.

1304
01:30:11,534 --> 01:30:13,595
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1305
01:30:17,076 --> 01:30:18,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Sir, you wish to speak on this matter?

1306
01:30:18,537 --> 01:30:18,977
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, please.

1307
01:30:19,017 --> 01:30:19,957
[SPEAKER_18]: My name is Michael Wajiro.

1308
01:30:19,997 --> 01:30:21,238
[SPEAKER_18]: I live in 18 Pembroke Street.

1309
01:30:21,798 --> 01:30:25,359
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm curious, have there been any complete architectural sketches of this bridge?

1310
01:30:25,419 --> 01:30:26,820
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I'm not aware of any.

1311
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:29,441
[SPEAKER_18]: And if possible, could the council request one?

1312
01:30:30,783 --> 01:30:38,431
[SPEAKER_18]: like a complete architectural sketch of what the bridge will look like, timetables of how this bridge is being constructed.

1313
01:30:38,731 --> 01:30:40,112
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll be getting before we did then.

1314
01:30:40,793 --> 01:30:43,876
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd be a better guy than us if you'd had them.

1315
01:30:44,937 --> 01:30:47,440
[SPEAKER_18]: So the DOT has like an architect on the plan?

1316
01:30:47,720 --> 01:30:49,162
[SPEAKER_18]: That they've changed multiple times?

1317
01:30:49,802 --> 01:30:51,704
[SPEAKER_18]: They just haven't shown it to you guys?

1318
01:30:52,165 --> 01:30:53,346
[SPEAKER_07]: We've seen some renderings.

1319
01:30:54,007 --> 01:30:55,468
[SPEAKER_07]: but they've changed, but they've changed.

1320
01:30:55,488 --> 01:30:55,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1321
01:30:55,608 --> 01:30:57,350
[SPEAKER_16]: They're public on the motion.

1322
01:30:57,450 --> 01:30:59,291
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Clerk, call the roll.

1323
01:30:59,311 --> 01:30:59,732
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1324
01:30:59,752 --> 01:30:59,812
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1325
01:31:19,758 --> 01:31:20,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1326
01:31:20,979 --> 01:31:22,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Seven in the affirmative, none negative.

1327
01:31:23,641 --> 01:31:25,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penta's motion passes.

1328
01:31:25,602 --> 01:31:30,064
[SPEAKER_14]: 15-322 offered by Councilor Penta.

1329
01:31:30,545 --> 01:31:39,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the mayor's ongoing refusal to respond to council resolutions timely or in a timely fashion be discussed.

1330
01:31:40,951 --> 01:31:46,794
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I don't know if you were on the council at the time, but it goes back some years ago that the mayor got himself in this

1331
01:31:47,615 --> 01:31:50,696
[SPEAKER_19]: where I think it was in a December of a particular year.

1332
01:31:51,496 --> 01:32:03,360
[SPEAKER_19]: And as a result of the council resolution coming forward, and I think there was a newspaper story, I don't know what, one of the Boston newspapers, all of a sudden we started getting council resolutions responded to, something like 25.

1333
01:32:03,820 --> 01:32:09,721
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, here we have tonight another page with some 20 plus resolutions not being responded to timely.

1334
01:32:10,862 --> 01:32:13,983
[SPEAKER_19]: Ones that I consider to be important are

1335
01:32:15,814 --> 01:32:26,819
[SPEAKER_19]: We sent a resolution upstairs to our city engineer regarding the MS4 program and what the involvement might be as it relates to the city of Medford, our needs and the cost.

1336
01:32:27,619 --> 01:32:35,222
[SPEAKER_19]: And I believe I made a notation of a letter that was sent as it related what the EPA was going to be doing and to relate to the charge.

1337
01:32:35,502 --> 01:32:39,064
[SPEAKER_19]: It was going to be almost like an $800, $900,000 hit to the city of Medford.

1338
01:32:39,624 --> 01:32:44,286
[SPEAKER_19]: And it would have been nice if she jumped on board or at least the city of Medford jumped on board.

1339
01:32:44,796 --> 01:32:48,499
[SPEAKER_19]: for the purposes of saying it would be a nutcracker at the particular time.

1340
01:32:48,859 --> 01:32:52,682
[SPEAKER_19]: We've had multiple issues regarding the water and sewer issues here in the city of Medford.

1341
01:32:52,882 --> 01:33:01,109
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, as it relates to expenditures for programs yet to be decided upon, and sitting on a $7.5 million surplus.

1342
01:33:01,749 --> 01:33:13,578
[SPEAKER_19]: We've constantly have been talking over the past, I think since the mayor decided to bring in the kiosk issues, constantly, again, with the mayor, making no responses other than saying within the purview of the council,

1343
01:33:13,911 --> 01:33:18,394
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, if all these things are within the purview of the council, then maybe we should just take the action that needs to be taken.

1344
01:33:18,814 --> 01:33:21,736
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, we had a street revitalization program.

1345
01:33:23,957 --> 01:33:25,078
[SPEAKER_19]: Where's his response to that?

1346
01:33:25,398 --> 01:33:28,220
[SPEAKER_19]: Where's his response to Councilman Longo's 3-1-1 program?

1347
01:33:28,821 --> 01:33:30,221
[SPEAKER_19]: We've had cable issues.

1348
01:33:30,762 --> 01:33:31,502
[SPEAKER_19]: The dog park.

1349
01:33:31,522 --> 01:33:33,784
[SPEAKER_19]: Five months.

1350
01:33:33,804 --> 01:33:33,984
[SPEAKER_19]: 3-1-1.

1351
01:33:34,004 --> 01:33:34,284
[SPEAKER_19]: 3-1-1.

1352
01:33:34,364 --> 01:33:35,085
[SPEAKER_19]: The dog park.

1353
01:33:35,585 --> 01:33:43,430
[SPEAKER_19]: Constantly on the cable issues in this community, where he's sitting on approximately $300 million of taxpayers' money

1354
01:33:44,073 --> 01:33:49,596
[SPEAKER_19]: strike that, $300,000 of taxpayers' money, of ratepayers' money on cable issues.

1355
01:33:49,996 --> 01:34:02,443
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, we have asked and we've asked for where is that public hearing on public access, the whole Comcast 10-year contract, which is coming up April 18th, and once again, no response.

1356
01:34:02,483 --> 01:34:04,204
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know that will be coming up at another time.

1357
01:34:04,885 --> 01:34:05,945
[SPEAKER_19]: I just think it's terrible.

1358
01:34:07,066 --> 01:34:07,306
[SPEAKER_19]: You know,

1359
01:34:08,022 --> 01:34:14,584
[SPEAKER_19]: Again, we as a council, we've had our issues between and amongst ourselves, but at least we were able to discuss them.

1360
01:34:14,604 --> 01:34:16,964
[SPEAKER_19]: We were able to get them out on the floor and talk on them.

1361
01:34:17,004 --> 01:34:18,645
[SPEAKER_19]: You vote them up, you vote them down, whatever it might be.

1362
01:34:19,205 --> 01:34:24,126
[SPEAKER_19]: This mayor, if it doesn't fit his agenda in any way, he just will not respond.

1363
01:34:24,786 --> 01:34:34,589
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think what happened back then was a motion and a movement for, I think it was a motion of, what was it?

1364
01:34:34,949 --> 01:34:35,749
[SPEAKER_19]: Not non-support.

1365
01:34:37,380 --> 01:34:38,261
[SPEAKER_19]: What the hell was the motion?

1366
01:34:38,441 --> 01:34:39,081
[SPEAKER_19]: What was the motion?

1367
01:34:39,101 --> 01:34:41,503
[SPEAKER_19]: Do you remember, Councilman Max?

1368
01:34:41,603 --> 01:34:45,726
[SPEAKER_19]: Because the mayor was refusing to respond to a vote of no confidence.

1369
01:34:45,766 --> 01:34:52,851
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what it was, a vote of no confidence, because he wasn't responding to our council resolutions, which basically, they're not for us.

1370
01:34:52,871 --> 01:34:54,512
[SPEAKER_19]: They're for the taxpayers of this community.

1371
01:34:54,892 --> 01:35:01,236
[SPEAKER_19]: And then all of a sudden, immediately, you saw 25 of them come at you, and everything went good for a while, and now we're right back to the same old thing.

1372
01:35:01,857 --> 01:35:06,220
[SPEAKER_19]: So with that being said, Mr. President, we do have a rule that talks about 10 days.

1373
01:35:06,940 --> 01:35:12,483
[SPEAKER_19]: that I believe it's 10 working days subsequent to any resolution that takes place.

1374
01:35:13,004 --> 01:35:22,650
[SPEAKER_19]: So, Mr. Clark, I'm going to ask you to do the following on your sheet, just to put one additional line in here, and that's the 10-day line, okay?

1375
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:33,956
[SPEAKER_19]: If the response hasn't come in in 10 days, you have department respondent, date respondent, I would like to have you another line in there to put the 10-day notice, that the 10 days has come and gone.

1376
01:35:34,377 --> 01:35:36,098
[SPEAKER_19]: That way there, you know,

1377
01:35:36,733 --> 01:35:42,896
[SPEAKER_19]: It's fair and it's open for everyone, and that way people aren't going to try to figure out what the hell are all these lines supposed to be.

1378
01:35:43,556 --> 01:35:47,098
[SPEAKER_19]: So, with that being said, Mr. President, I just think it's about that time.

1379
01:35:47,518 --> 01:35:49,179
[SPEAKER_19]: Craddock Bridge, another perfect example.

1380
01:35:49,879 --> 01:35:52,901
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, you get the letter, no information coming back, forthcoming.

1381
01:35:53,101 --> 01:35:54,822
[SPEAKER_19]: You have to find out all this stuff on your own.

1382
01:35:55,610 --> 01:36:01,555
[SPEAKER_19]: It's almost like you have to be your own detective to do your own work, because the city administration just doesn't want to participate.

1383
01:36:02,115 --> 01:36:06,238
[SPEAKER_19]: But then all of a sudden, when they want something, they're on top of you.

1384
01:36:06,899 --> 01:36:09,521
[SPEAKER_19]: You've got to vote for this, and if you don't vote for this, you're anti-this.

1385
01:36:10,422 --> 01:36:11,783
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilman Marks, perfect example.

1386
01:36:12,303 --> 01:36:17,447
[SPEAKER_19]: He and a group of people started because the mayor wouldn't do anything with a dog park, because the mayor said it was going to be over $200,000 to do a dog park.

1387
01:36:19,889 --> 01:36:25,594
[SPEAKER_19]: Council Marks and a group of people get together, they figure out a place, they put something together, and what's the mayor do?

1388
01:36:25,714 --> 01:36:27,997
[SPEAKER_19]: The mayor tries to, you know, grandstand and take it away.

1389
01:36:28,437 --> 01:36:34,162
[SPEAKER_19]: With all due respect, Councilor Camuso, it was your issue that brought up the thing on the opiates and the drugs and the addictions in this community.

1390
01:36:34,763 --> 01:36:39,927
[SPEAKER_19]: And the mayor pulled not only an end run, he tried to pull the rug right from under you to try to make it look like it's his deal now.

1391
01:36:40,228 --> 01:36:40,928
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's not right.

1392
01:36:40,988 --> 01:36:43,291
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Longo, you had the thing on 311.

1393
01:36:43,951 --> 01:36:45,573
[SPEAKER_19]: Nothing, no response to that at all.

1394
01:36:46,668 --> 01:36:49,810
[SPEAKER_19]: It's just, we could go on to each council and what they were here for.

1395
01:36:50,130 --> 01:36:51,231
[SPEAKER_19]: He's just not responding.

1396
01:36:51,631 --> 01:36:53,212
[SPEAKER_19]: And these resolutions are too important.

1397
01:36:53,693 --> 01:37:02,538
[SPEAKER_19]: So Mr. Clerk, my council colleagues, I'm asking that the clerk change his tracking system to include one extra column and that's the 10 day.

1398
01:37:02,919 --> 01:37:04,760
[SPEAKER_19]: Once the 10 days are up, at least we know it.

1399
01:37:05,000 --> 01:37:11,044
[SPEAKER_19]: And then the council at that point in time can either take its vote to override them or do what needs to be done.

1400
01:37:14,065 --> 01:37:16,226
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Pinto, all those in favor?

1401
01:37:16,246 --> 01:37:17,247
[SPEAKER_14]: Wait a minute, these people.

1402
01:37:17,687 --> 01:37:18,868
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry, Mr. Citizen.

1403
01:37:19,148 --> 01:37:20,769
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1404
01:37:21,289 --> 01:37:22,390
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1405
01:37:22,690 --> 01:37:24,852
[SPEAKER_17]: Robert Cappucci, 71 Evans Street.

1406
01:37:25,752 --> 01:37:28,454
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll be 45 this year.

1407
01:37:28,774 --> 01:37:30,975
[SPEAKER_17]: I grew up my whole life in Medford.

1408
01:37:32,636 --> 01:37:38,100
[SPEAKER_17]: Over the last few decades, I'm sorry, I hate to say it, but I'm seeing Medford deteriorate.

1409
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:41,482
[SPEAKER_17]: We've got all these wonderful resolutions that this council has offered.

1410
01:37:42,027 --> 01:37:57,910
[SPEAKER_17]: to combat things like string of robberies on Salem Street recently, this heroin addiction problem, the police department falling apart, the police force itself understaffed, the fire department doesn't have an internal email system.

1411
01:37:58,210 --> 01:38:02,091
[SPEAKER_17]: I was shocked when the president of the union said that a few weeks ago here.

1412
01:38:02,511 --> 01:38:11,053
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, we can just go down the list of things, and it all comes back to our strong Mayor Plan A charter.

1413
01:38:11,437 --> 01:38:20,901
[SPEAKER_17]: You can, with all due respect, Councilor Penter, you can put the 10-day line on it, but at the end of the day, the real power that this council has is on the budget and cutting the budgets.

1414
01:38:20,941 --> 01:38:33,327
[SPEAKER_17]: You can make resolutions and recommendations, but it's, and with all due respect to the mayor, I mean, I see him at events, he's a really nice guy, he always says hi to me, but it's just that office.

1415
01:38:33,708 --> 01:38:37,189
[SPEAKER_17]: There's too much concentrated power in one office.

1416
01:38:37,689 --> 01:38:40,331
[SPEAKER_17]: Now, I tried years ago with Dr. Sturela

1417
01:38:41,343 --> 01:38:45,186
[SPEAKER_17]: to get a petition going to have our charter reviewed.

1418
01:38:45,747 --> 01:38:51,331
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's been almost, what, 30 years, Councillor Marks, since our charter's been reviewed?

1419
01:38:51,852 --> 01:38:57,096
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, how many of these small businesses out here work under the same business model as 1986, 87, 88?

1420
01:38:58,677 --> 01:39:00,659
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think any of them.

1421
01:39:01,940 --> 01:39:07,825
[SPEAKER_17]: If this council has the power and authority to implement a charter review,

1422
01:39:08,315 --> 01:39:10,837
[SPEAKER_17]: It's long past due.

1423
01:39:11,037 --> 01:39:19,962
[SPEAKER_17]: I love Medford with all my heart, and I'm just seeing it change, and not for the better.

1424
01:39:20,002 --> 01:39:22,163
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't get me wrong, there's a lot of good things about Medford.

1425
01:39:22,464 --> 01:39:28,487
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a lot of great potential here, location to the city, right off the highway here.

1426
01:39:28,887 --> 01:39:33,810
[SPEAKER_17]: We could do so much for the businesses and the community of Medford.

1427
01:39:35,872 --> 01:39:37,973
[SPEAKER_17]: With all due respect, I know you folks work hard,

1428
01:39:38,323 --> 01:39:42,186
[SPEAKER_17]: But it makes a lot of us ask, why is this council one of the highest paid in the state?

1429
01:39:42,606 --> 01:39:45,768
[SPEAKER_17]: Why is the mayor one of the highest paid in the state?

1430
01:39:49,131 --> 01:39:56,356
[SPEAKER_17]: For all that money, it seems like, including yourselves, we should all be getting a little bit more.

1431
01:39:56,416 --> 01:40:03,340
[SPEAKER_17]: And all these resolutions that are coming down the pike, that are going unnoticed, unrecognized, unresponded to.

1432
01:40:04,461 --> 01:40:05,962
[SPEAKER_17]: With all due respect, again, to the mayor,

1433
01:40:07,510 --> 01:40:10,612
[SPEAKER_17]: What Councillor Camuso said a few weeks ago was spot on.

1434
01:40:10,893 --> 01:40:12,494
[SPEAKER_17]: It's leadership that's tired.

1435
01:40:12,994 --> 01:40:26,204
[SPEAKER_17]: And we need to review the charter of the city government here in Medford because it needs to be looked at and based on recommendations by the Charter Review Commission, it most likely probably should be changed.

1436
01:40:26,284 --> 01:40:32,088
[SPEAKER_17]: I think a lot of great testimony for that change was given tonight by the Honourable Robert M. Penta.

1437
01:40:32,409 --> 01:40:33,629
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much for your time.

1438
01:40:35,465 --> 01:40:37,166
[SPEAKER_17]: deeply take that under advisement.

1439
01:40:37,266 --> 01:40:37,566
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1440
01:40:37,586 --> 01:40:39,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much, Senator.

1441
01:40:39,748 --> 01:40:41,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Sir, please state your name and address for the record.

1442
01:40:41,889 --> 01:40:44,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave., Medford.

1443
01:40:45,031 --> 01:40:46,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I like that word, override, I heard.

1444
01:40:47,212 --> 01:40:48,092
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good one.

1445
01:40:49,133 --> 01:40:51,795
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been talking about public records requests to this council.

1446
01:40:52,255 --> 01:40:53,215
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor has emails.

1447
01:40:53,576 --> 01:40:54,436
[SPEAKER_04]: The mayor has notes.

1448
01:40:55,377 --> 01:40:59,279
[SPEAKER_04]: Start putting public records requests in and start requesting those notes, those documents.

1449
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:00,860
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very important.

1450
01:41:01,534 --> 01:41:02,535
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give you a quick story.

1451
01:41:02,715 --> 01:41:06,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Today, I went to the mayor's assistance office, very nice woman.

1452
01:41:07,198 --> 01:41:14,864
[SPEAKER_04]: She got to another woman who does the—when the mayor has the press conferences, she said, Mark is handling it, meaning Mark Rumley.

1453
01:41:14,904 --> 01:41:16,045
[SPEAKER_04]: So I went to Mark Rumley's office.

1454
01:41:16,105 --> 01:41:17,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, this is the third visit.

1455
01:41:18,387 --> 01:41:19,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark was in a meeting.

1456
01:41:19,768 --> 01:41:20,528
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked to Janice.

1457
01:41:20,568 --> 01:41:21,289
[SPEAKER_04]: She's very nice.

1458
01:41:22,309 --> 01:41:26,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Rumley got back to me and said, Peter Epstein is the attorney for the city.

1459
01:41:26,973 --> 01:41:29,575
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wrote back, Mark, you're not answering my question.

1460
01:41:29,735 --> 01:41:31,096
[SPEAKER_04]: When is the Comcast public hearing?

1461
01:41:31,446 --> 01:41:50,531
[SPEAKER_04]: So just me, a citizen, as the council president calls us, Mr. Citizen, yes, if the council can't get this, but think about this, I'm asking, that letter you saw from Comcast, it was eight months to a year ago that I started putting in public records requests, November 20th, and I finally got information on St.

1462
01:41:50,571 --> 01:41:51,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Paddy's Day.

1463
01:41:51,892 --> 01:41:59,754
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I asked in November, the letter came in in December, and you city councilors and all the citizens out there, Councilor Pinto's right.

1464
01:42:00,610 --> 01:42:02,311
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be a private detective around here.

1465
01:42:02,391 --> 01:42:04,152
[SPEAKER_04]: And today, I'm in the private detective mode.

1466
01:42:04,652 --> 01:42:05,413
[SPEAKER_04]: Comcast knows.

1467
01:42:05,493 --> 01:42:06,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Peter Epstein knows.

1468
01:42:06,734 --> 01:42:07,574
[SPEAKER_04]: You people all know.

1469
01:42:08,174 --> 01:42:12,897
[SPEAKER_04]: They are not responding to this Comcast public hearing because they don't want to have it.

1470
01:42:16,419 --> 01:42:18,521
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Penter, all those in favor.

1471
01:42:19,221 --> 01:42:20,762
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call vote has been requested.

1472
01:42:27,986 --> 01:42:29,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1473
01:42:35,025 --> 01:42:35,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Camuso?

1474
01:42:35,605 --> 01:42:35,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1475
01:42:36,786 --> 01:42:37,466
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Cavillo?

1476
01:42:37,506 --> 01:42:37,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1477
01:42:38,447 --> 01:42:39,007
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight?

1478
01:42:39,227 --> 01:42:39,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1479
01:42:39,968 --> 01:42:40,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Longo Kern?

1480
01:42:40,808 --> 01:42:40,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1481
01:42:41,789 --> 01:42:42,309
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks?

1482
01:42:42,329 --> 01:42:42,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1483
01:42:43,790 --> 01:42:44,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Penta?

1484
01:42:44,350 --> 01:42:44,451
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1485
01:42:45,931 --> 01:42:46,752
[SPEAKER_09]: President DelaRusso?

1486
01:42:46,812 --> 01:42:47,112
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1487
01:42:47,132 --> 01:42:49,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Seven in the affirmative, none negative.

1488
01:42:49,133 --> 01:42:52,155
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes unanimously.

1489
01:42:52,175 --> 01:42:57,518
[SPEAKER_14]: 15-323 offered by Councilor Penta.

1490
01:42:58,179 --> 01:43:03,902
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the continued lack of the city's public safety action after having been

1491
01:43:04,283 --> 01:43:21,109
[SPEAKER_14]: put on notice for well over three weeks regarding its downtown lighting and the chronic power outage problems, once again, having occurred this past week in Medford Square, costing the businesses thousands in loss of revenue, employee time, and loss of product.

1492
01:43:21,609 --> 01:43:31,393
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is at least the third time within the past year this loss of electricity has occurred, be it further resolved that a representative from National Grid and the mayor's office

1493
01:43:31,930 --> 01:43:58,303
[SPEAKER_14]: needs to appear before the council to address this matter and address what upgrades are needed, when it will be completed, and will businesses be reimbursed for loss of revenue and product, as well as the ongoing kiosk fiasco that continues to upset customers in small business locations throughout our city.

1494
01:43:58,724 --> 01:43:59,644
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penta.

1495
01:44:00,024 --> 01:44:01,365
[SPEAKER_19]: On this matter, Mr. President,

1496
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:05,281
[SPEAKER_19]: There are six street lights that are out in the heart of Medford Square.

1497
01:44:05,301 --> 01:44:11,762
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, you have to be blind, or maybe you will be because... Visually impaired.

1498
01:44:11,822 --> 01:44:13,802
[SPEAKER_19]: Visually impaired, or whatever you want to call it.

1499
01:44:14,382 --> 01:44:17,343
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know what the mayor doesn't see that everyone else can see.

1500
01:44:18,003 --> 01:44:21,603
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe he doesn't go out at nighttime, or maybe he doesn't go through Medford Square.

1501
01:44:21,943 --> 01:44:28,365
[SPEAKER_19]: Problem being, everyone that does go to the square, it's a public safety hazard, it's a public safety risk.

1502
01:44:29,245 --> 01:44:30,445
[SPEAKER_19]: Once again, this past week,

1503
01:44:31,307 --> 01:44:32,888
[SPEAKER_19]: Electricity went out in Medford Square.

1504
01:44:33,669 --> 01:44:39,052
[SPEAKER_19]: Many businesses were affected by this, affected to the point that it's not the first time that this has happened.

1505
01:44:39,573 --> 01:44:46,898
[SPEAKER_19]: And as a result of the businesses being out and lost employee time and loss of product, again, the employees were not notified.

1506
01:44:46,918 --> 01:44:48,058
[SPEAKER_19]: There has been no updates.

1507
01:44:48,719 --> 01:44:49,940
[SPEAKER_19]: You just have to figure this out.

1508
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:56,944
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think when you hear all the sirens going around on a particular morning trying to figure out what it is, was it a bank robbery or was it something?

1509
01:44:57,625 --> 01:44:58,725
[SPEAKER_19]: It was the lights that were out.

1510
01:44:59,346 --> 01:45:00,927
[SPEAKER_19]: Also, those lights that were out

1511
01:45:01,837 --> 01:45:06,399
[SPEAKER_19]: I believe the same situation happened again today when the electricity went down at the McGlynn School.

1512
01:45:07,159 --> 01:45:19,244
[SPEAKER_19]: And as a result of the electricity going down, I don't know if it was an extended period of time or what have you, I was led to believe and I thought that these schools all had backup generators for the purposes of if they lost the electricity.

1513
01:45:19,304 --> 01:45:20,064
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I don't know.

1514
01:45:20,564 --> 01:45:26,046
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a couple of parents called up and they were upset over the fact of the matter is that, you know, this took place today.

1515
01:45:26,847 --> 01:45:30,028
[SPEAKER_19]: Why and how it happened, I don't know, but apparently it did.

1516
01:45:31,146 --> 01:45:42,014
[SPEAKER_19]: Back in, I think it was 2001 or 2003, if the city remembers correctly, I think it was in June or July, there was an extreme power outage in the city, and it was down for an extensive period of time.

1517
01:45:42,594 --> 01:45:52,742
[SPEAKER_19]: And National Grid came in, and I believe that it had something to do somewhere off of, I can't think of the name of the street, where they have their transmission lines.

1518
01:45:53,182 --> 01:45:58,326
[SPEAKER_19]: And they came in there and they put a brand new electrical service into the city of Medford, Mr. President.

1519
01:45:58,766 --> 01:45:59,427
[SPEAKER_19]: And what they did,

1520
01:45:59,884 --> 01:46:03,466
[SPEAKER_19]: And I believe they put a corollary line that was next to it.

1521
01:46:03,486 --> 01:46:10,931
[SPEAKER_19]: So just in case, the outage because of the use of electricity, I believe it was a hot summer, this would not happen again.

1522
01:46:10,951 --> 01:46:12,572
[SPEAKER_19]: It would just jump to this other line.

1523
01:46:13,132 --> 01:46:16,154
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, whether this happened at the school today or not, I don't know.

1524
01:46:16,654 --> 01:46:20,756
[SPEAKER_19]: Whether all the businesses or how many businesses got affected in Medford Square, I don't know.

1525
01:46:21,117 --> 01:46:28,481
[SPEAKER_19]: But it's apparently, you know, when people call and express their concern as to why this is happening, and they can't get an answer, and it's going to be corrected,

1526
01:46:29,027 --> 01:46:30,828
[SPEAKER_19]: You have to deal with the business in and of itself.

1527
01:46:30,908 --> 01:46:34,770
[SPEAKER_19]: Was there a loss of product, loss of employee time, a loss of business?

1528
01:46:36,091 --> 01:46:41,353
[SPEAKER_19]: And the overtime that the police department had to pay to go over there now is direct to traffic and to move people around.

1529
01:46:42,214 --> 01:46:50,618
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, you take all of that, and you just add on one more effect, one more effect that's affecting the people here, and that's the kiosk and the square once again.

1530
01:46:51,299 --> 01:46:53,119
[SPEAKER_19]: And what's going on, I don't know.

1531
01:46:53,620 --> 01:46:54,880
[SPEAKER_19]: But this was one heck of a week.

1532
01:46:55,621 --> 01:46:57,922
[SPEAKER_19]: Because no sooner did we meet this past Tuesday night,

1533
01:46:58,295 --> 01:47:05,880
[SPEAKER_19]: Last Tuesday night, the very next day I'm in Medford Square and there's a gentleman at 634 trying to put money into a meter.

1534
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:10,302
[SPEAKER_19]: And I was there with my wife and we said to him, listen sir, you don't have to.

1535
01:47:10,943 --> 01:47:12,264
[SPEAKER_19]: It stops at six o'clock.

1536
01:47:12,744 --> 01:47:13,585
[SPEAKER_19]: He says, I don't know that.

1537
01:47:13,925 --> 01:47:15,526
[SPEAKER_19]: No sign said that, okay?

1538
01:47:17,007 --> 01:47:18,287
[SPEAKER_19]: Six o'clock, eight to six.

1539
01:47:18,848 --> 01:47:19,688
[SPEAKER_19]: No sign said that.

1540
01:47:19,728 --> 01:47:20,829
[SPEAKER_19]: This was 634.

1541
01:47:21,750 --> 01:47:22,530
[SPEAKER_19]: I have another one.

1542
01:47:23,871 --> 01:47:24,811
[SPEAKER_19]: I have another one here.

1543
01:47:24,851 --> 01:47:26,212
[SPEAKER_19]: This one here is dated on 324.

1544
01:47:30,303 --> 01:47:36,286
[SPEAKER_19]: 738, supposed to start at 8 o'clock in the morning, 738 AM, giving out tickets.

1545
01:47:36,986 --> 01:47:41,749
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, people who are paying, anyone who might be paying right now, you have to realize something.

1546
01:47:42,009 --> 01:47:43,209
[SPEAKER_19]: It's 8 to 6 in the morning.

1547
01:47:43,269 --> 01:47:44,430
[SPEAKER_19]: It became effective March 15.

1548
01:47:45,210 --> 01:47:46,911
[SPEAKER_19]: That's when the Traffic Commission voted upon it.

1549
01:47:47,191 --> 01:47:50,012
[SPEAKER_19]: That's when our city solicitor said it was legal and we could do it.

1550
01:47:50,252 --> 01:47:56,115
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's when the bounty hunters from Tennessee said it's OK, then we're going to go with these new laws.

1551
01:47:56,475 --> 01:47:58,776
[SPEAKER_19]: So every dime and every quarter that they're collecting

1552
01:47:59,132 --> 01:48:01,373
[SPEAKER_19]: is I would say it's right now it's illegal.

1553
01:48:01,914 --> 01:48:07,877
[SPEAKER_19]: They are wrongly collecting and taking money out of that, out of those meters from people that are going there.

1554
01:48:10,138 --> 01:48:19,564
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Caviello, you said on December 23rd in your resolution that you wanted a 60-day report, a financial report as to what they were doing, effective when it becomes operative.

1555
01:48:20,084 --> 01:48:23,926
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Knight, that was your term, when it becomes operative.

1556
01:48:24,162 --> 01:48:25,002
[SPEAKER_19]: And we agreed to that.

1557
01:48:25,382 --> 01:48:27,143
[SPEAKER_19]: January 15th is when they went online.

1558
01:48:27,923 --> 01:48:31,163
[SPEAKER_19]: March 15th has come and gone, and we have received absolutely nothing.

1559
01:48:31,223 --> 01:48:34,164
[SPEAKER_19]: Today is March 31st, nothing, zero.

1560
01:48:36,164 --> 01:48:52,467
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, again, this past week on Riverside Avenue, not Riverside Avenue, the ring road, excuse me, where the ring road is, once again, that truck that they own, those bounty hunters from Tennessee,

1561
01:48:53,407 --> 01:49:00,269
[SPEAKER_19]: who park their truck illegally, illegally on the ring road, and they have the audacity to go out there and give tickets.

1562
01:49:00,870 --> 01:49:03,070
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not marked like it's supposed to be in the back.

1563
01:49:03,831 --> 01:49:14,514
[SPEAKER_19]: They're giving out tickets erroneously, because if people are getting there before 7, strike that, before 8, and after 6 at night, they're still tagging them and giving them tickets.

1564
01:49:14,894 --> 01:49:16,715
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Camuso, they want to go back.

1565
01:49:18,104 --> 01:49:19,125
[SPEAKER_19]: Remember what we talked about?

1566
01:49:19,565 --> 01:49:24,490
[SPEAKER_19]: They thought it was going to be a great idea, putting the $5 thing down there and place that road by Winthrop Street.

1567
01:49:25,651 --> 01:49:27,332
[SPEAKER_19]: Now we're down to one, with a main plate.

1568
01:49:27,713 --> 01:49:30,936
[SPEAKER_19]: A main plate, okay, the other guy's on vacation.

1569
01:49:31,256 --> 01:49:34,979
[SPEAKER_19]: A main plate of a guy sitting down there, okay, and that's all that they're getting.

1570
01:49:36,240 --> 01:49:40,444
[SPEAKER_19]: Those cars that were parking there have now filtered their way into the West Mefford area.

1571
01:49:40,985 --> 01:49:42,486
[SPEAKER_19]: Go to the downtown West Mefford Square.

1572
01:49:45,067 --> 01:49:46,427
[SPEAKER_19]: Warren Street and all the side street.

1573
01:49:46,847 --> 01:49:48,228
[SPEAKER_19]: That's where the cars are parking.

1574
01:49:48,588 --> 01:49:50,448
[SPEAKER_19]: Go to West Medford and strike that.

1575
01:49:50,468 --> 01:49:55,049
[SPEAKER_19]: You go to Medford Square, the people, they say, oh yeah, the spots are there.

1576
01:49:55,629 --> 01:49:58,730
[SPEAKER_19]: The spots are there because people don't want to pay to put their money into the quarter.

1577
01:49:59,150 --> 01:50:01,211
[SPEAKER_19]: Go into CVS and talk to the people there.

1578
01:50:01,571 --> 01:50:09,272
[SPEAKER_19]: They're actually having fights with people who are in the armory parking in the CVS parking lot, which that's not their parking lot.

1579
01:50:09,292 --> 01:50:12,333
[SPEAKER_19]: Because people don't want to pay to put that quarter in there.

1580
01:50:12,713 --> 01:50:14,135
[SPEAKER_19]: I was talking to a dentist's office.

1581
01:50:14,435 --> 01:50:15,536
[SPEAKER_19]: These two women that were in there.

1582
01:50:15,676 --> 01:50:18,379
[SPEAKER_19]: I was in the eye doctor today.

1583
01:50:18,459 --> 01:50:28,468
[SPEAKER_19]: Four people in the last two days basically saying, you know, we're not coming back to the square because, you know, it's bad enough you can't figure out where the kiosk goes and where it's supposed to be.

1584
01:50:28,929 --> 01:50:30,970
[SPEAKER_19]: Five or six cars up, five or six cars back.

1585
01:50:31,631 --> 01:50:33,893
[SPEAKER_19]: But how do you go there and put the money in there?

1586
01:50:34,153 --> 01:50:37,757
[SPEAKER_19]: How do you know when you go to a doctor or a dentist you're not going to be longer than what they expect it to be?

1587
01:50:38,561 --> 01:50:43,064
[SPEAKER_19]: The stupidest thing of this whole thing, Councilor Camoso, I'm going to go back to what you originally said in the beginning.

1588
01:50:43,745 --> 01:50:48,128
[SPEAKER_19]: If in fact the mayor had meters put in, people would understand what a meter looks like.

1589
01:50:48,148 --> 01:50:49,689
[SPEAKER_19]: They would know how to put the money in the meter.

1590
01:50:50,010 --> 01:50:51,811
[SPEAKER_19]: These kiosks are just doing damage.

1591
01:50:51,871 --> 01:50:52,972
[SPEAKER_19]: Go to the gentleman.

1592
01:50:54,943 --> 01:50:55,243
[SPEAKER_19]: Pardon me?

1593
01:50:55,963 --> 01:50:57,424
[SPEAKER_19]: Boston's doing 1,000 new meters.

1594
01:50:57,464 --> 01:50:59,304
[SPEAKER_19]: But remember the new meters that Boston is doing.

1595
01:51:00,024 --> 01:51:02,665
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't give them any compliments, because they have figured this thing out.

1596
01:51:02,725 --> 01:51:11,946
[SPEAKER_19]: If it's prime time of the day, and that metered spot is something that they need, they can raise the price on those meters mechanically, technology, from where they are.

1597
01:51:12,006 --> 01:51:19,068
[SPEAKER_19]: So you could pay a quarter or one minute for 15 minutes, and you could pay a quarter for five minutes if they decide that that's the route that they want to go.

1598
01:51:20,066 --> 01:51:23,847
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I have a resolution on here, as you know.

1599
01:51:24,467 --> 01:51:37,432
[SPEAKER_19]: What I would like to do is to take my other resolution that is, it was from last week, 15-307, take that off the table, and I would like to make a motion, take the motion from that, Mr. President.

1600
01:51:37,452 --> 01:51:46,675
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. President, we have Councilor Blumel who wanted to speak next.

1601
01:51:48,804 --> 01:52:02,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, with regards to the parking program, I think we need to sit down as soon as possible with the Chief of Police, somebody from Republic, whether it's at a Committee of the Whole meeting.

1602
01:52:03,118 --> 01:52:04,579
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some serious issues.

1603
01:52:04,599 --> 01:52:09,964
[SPEAKER_14]: Let me communicate from the Mayor's office regarding setting up that meeting.

1604
01:52:10,345 --> 01:52:12,647
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to call for a Committee of the Whole meeting next week.

1605
01:52:13,230 --> 01:52:26,760
[SPEAKER_14]: which will include members of the traffic commission and members of the administration who are key to this and representative Nash of the Republican parking.

1606
01:52:27,701 --> 01:52:28,361
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be great.

1607
01:52:28,401 --> 01:52:36,728
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we're all getting the emails, the complaints, the concerns, and it just seems like Republic really, really, really needs to get it together.

1608
01:52:37,728 --> 01:52:42,612
[SPEAKER_03]: There was three people waiting in line for a kiosk and I got calls that they're standing there giving

1609
01:52:43,065 --> 01:52:47,088
[SPEAKER_03]: tickets out to the people that are actually waiting in line for the kiosk.

1610
01:52:47,108 --> 01:52:53,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I also got complaints with regards to the kiosk in front of Alamo Roast Beef, Cosmopolitan Realty.

1611
01:52:54,873 --> 01:52:57,915
[SPEAKER_03]: They're giving tickets even though people are paying for time.

1612
01:52:58,096 --> 01:53:06,341
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the people are fighting with the actual person giving a ticket, saying, look at it, it's five, I have till 5.50, yet he's giving them a ticket at 5.30.

1613
01:53:06,922 --> 01:53:09,784
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's just some serious, serious problems.

1614
01:53:10,184 --> 01:53:11,385
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bad enough to get a ticket.

1615
01:53:12,110 --> 01:53:22,392
[SPEAKER_03]: if you don't pay, if you went over or you're stuck in a doctor's office, to actually pay and get a ticket or to be in line to pay and get a ticket while you're standing there.

1616
01:53:22,832 --> 01:53:28,973
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people are getting apologized to by the actual parking enforcement officials.

1617
01:53:29,533 --> 01:53:37,354
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to have Republic get a grip and everybody be on the same page and run this program.

1618
01:53:37,754 --> 01:53:39,355
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this program's tough enough.

1619
01:53:40,575 --> 01:53:41,795
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to run it properly.

1620
01:53:42,765 --> 01:53:45,447
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to run it properly and we need to give recommendations.

1621
01:53:45,527 --> 01:53:54,292
[SPEAKER_03]: We've helped change the hours, reduce the hours by two hours a day, but more needs to be done or this isn't gonna work and our businesses are gonna suffer.

1622
01:53:56,254 --> 01:53:57,595
[SPEAKER_14]: Councillor Marks, wish to speak?

1623
01:53:57,875 --> 01:54:04,059
[SPEAKER_16]: Just if I could briefly, Mr. President, on the two different points that Councillor Penta raised in his motion.

1624
01:54:04,959 --> 01:54:12,104
[SPEAKER_16]: I think from National Grid, we should also get back, I think it was two years ago, Councillor Penta, when the last outage, was it two years ago?

1625
01:54:13,329 --> 01:54:17,992
[SPEAKER_16]: that they said it was a transformer, a faulty transformer, and that they were upgrading it.

1626
01:54:18,432 --> 01:54:25,055
[SPEAKER_16]: As you probably recall, too, we have a problem with the signal lights down in the square, too, and that was being upgraded at the same time.

1627
01:54:25,535 --> 01:54:34,519
[SPEAKER_16]: But if we can get a report back from National Grid, this frequency is far too often on Riverside Avenue Square, and it poses a real hardship on the business owners.

1628
01:54:35,020 --> 01:54:40,502
[SPEAKER_16]: And secondly, Mr. President, I was told that they had to hold off work until the 300-pound

1629
01:54:42,665 --> 01:54:52,227
[SPEAKER_16]: the cement planter, which was placed strategically over the metal grate in the sidewalk that leads to the transformer underground was moved.

1630
01:54:52,888 --> 01:55:00,469
[SPEAKER_16]: So whoever put these planters in the square, put one over the access box into the transformer.

1631
01:55:00,910 --> 01:55:09,292
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think the city should look in the rest of the length of the square to see if any of these giant planters are placed on an access box.

1632
01:55:11,514 --> 01:55:14,595
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Pentland has been mentioning this about the kiosk.

1633
01:55:14,836 --> 01:55:23,639
[SPEAKER_16]: It's unacceptable to have no hours of operation listed, or I should say hours of operation that are no longer in use.

1634
01:55:24,300 --> 01:55:27,321
[SPEAKER_16]: And in reality, it's robbery.

1635
01:55:27,801 --> 01:55:28,382
[SPEAKER_16]: It really is.

1636
01:55:28,762 --> 01:55:29,942
[SPEAKER_16]: There's no other way to call it.

1637
01:55:29,982 --> 01:55:35,625
[SPEAKER_16]: If you know that you're charging for a time that you're not supposed to be charging for, that's robbery.

1638
01:55:36,445 --> 01:55:38,926
[SPEAKER_16]: That's white collar robbery.

1639
01:55:39,406 --> 01:55:40,427
[SPEAKER_14]: If a businessman

1640
01:55:41,265 --> 01:55:46,986
[SPEAKER_14]: did something contrary to what was advertised, they'd be charged by the Federal Trade Commission.

1641
01:55:47,887 --> 01:55:50,487
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know how they're allowed to get away with that.

1642
01:55:51,127 --> 01:55:51,787
[SPEAKER_16]: I really don't.

1643
01:55:52,388 --> 01:56:03,590
[SPEAKER_16]: And I don't know why this administration who signed the contract isn't standing up on behalf of not only every resident, but anyone that comes into our community and say, you know what, enough's enough.

1644
01:56:04,190 --> 01:56:06,331
[SPEAKER_16]: The hours were changed to have ample opportunity.

1645
01:56:06,671 --> 01:56:10,832
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Caviello talked about having the signage

1646
01:56:11,733 --> 01:56:17,115
[SPEAKER_16]: regarding the times to be put on the kiosk itself so people can clearly see it.

1647
01:56:17,435 --> 01:56:28,439
[SPEAKER_16]: He also talked about having it so you could see each kiosk from a distance, having some type of flag, something that shows where the kiosk are.

1648
01:56:28,839 --> 01:56:36,281
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Camuso mentioned about changing the color of the tickets that they're giving out from white to a red or an orange ticket.

1649
01:56:37,462 --> 01:56:40,923
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I just don't see anything happening, Mr. President, with this program.

1650
01:56:41,776 --> 01:56:51,725
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and it really frustrates me when I see residents being tagged, uh, or having to put money in a meter that the hours of operation have changed.

1651
01:56:52,806 --> 01:56:54,047
[SPEAKER_16]: It really frustrates me.

1652
01:56:54,627 --> 01:56:57,109
[SPEAKER_16]: And, um, you know, something needs to be done immediately.

1653
01:56:57,770 --> 01:57:01,934
[SPEAKER_16]: And, uh, we, we may get to the point where we need to tell people, stop feeding the meters.

1654
01:57:02,654 --> 01:57:06,958
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, it may, it may have to come a groundswell, say stop feeding these meters until this

1655
01:57:07,567 --> 01:57:14,573
[SPEAKER_16]: company is able to get their business in order, I don't think they should be charging, Mr. President.

1656
01:57:14,593 --> 01:57:15,154
[SPEAKER_16]: I really don't.

1657
01:57:16,117 --> 01:57:18,158
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we were sold a bill of goods.

1658
01:57:18,178 --> 01:57:23,299
[SPEAKER_16]: These machines were going to be able to put money in with your iPhone, this, that.

1659
01:57:23,839 --> 01:57:27,720
[SPEAKER_16]: We sold a bill of goods, and meanwhile, they can't change the hour of operation.

1660
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:30,721
[SPEAKER_16]: They can't indicate on the screen, hey, now it's 8 to 6.

1661
01:57:31,541 --> 01:57:32,561
[SPEAKER_16]: It used to be 7 to 7.

1662
01:57:33,382 --> 01:57:39,683
[SPEAKER_16]: That, to me, seems like a basic, you know, key entry that you plug in the central computer, and it goes to all kiosks.

1663
01:57:40,204 --> 01:57:41,404
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't understand what's happening.

1664
01:57:42,184 --> 01:57:42,785
[SPEAKER_16]: I really don't.

1665
01:57:43,045 --> 01:57:43,745
[SPEAKER_16]: It's frustrating.

1666
01:57:44,145 --> 01:57:48,208
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would hope, Mr. President, under your leadership that we get this meeting immediately.

1667
01:57:48,688 --> 01:57:50,749
[SPEAKER_16]: And if the mayor doesn't want to attend, good luck to him.

1668
01:57:51,290 --> 01:57:54,491
[SPEAKER_16]: But we'll call all the other parties together, Mr. President.

1669
01:57:54,852 --> 01:57:55,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1670
01:57:55,352 --> 01:57:55,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1671
01:57:56,673 --> 01:57:57,473
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Camuso.

1672
01:57:58,054 --> 01:57:59,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1673
01:58:00,135 --> 01:58:05,578
[SPEAKER_05]: I do know that just from firsthand experience that they can be reprogrammed and they are programmed right now.

1674
01:58:06,418 --> 01:58:09,020
[SPEAKER_05]: So at seven o'clock, they don't accept any more money.

1675
01:58:10,300 --> 01:58:21,087
[SPEAKER_05]: 15 minutes of 7, quarter of 7 the other day, the machine would only take one quarter from me on Saturday evening because it was still programmed to 7 o'clock rather than 6 o'clock, but it didn't allow me to put in anything after 7.

1676
01:58:21,987 --> 01:58:26,770
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's definitely the information technology side.

1677
01:58:26,790 --> 01:58:27,771
[SPEAKER_05]: It just has to be adjusted.

1678
01:58:28,551 --> 01:58:35,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what we should also ask the city administration to put out a reverse 911 call advising the entire community

1679
01:58:36,025 --> 01:58:39,446
[SPEAKER_05]: That the meters are now in effect until 6 p.m.

1680
01:58:39,926 --> 01:59:01,634
[SPEAKER_05]: With the new revised hours so that people it's one way to get it get it out there quick a big blast to the community and And then word of mouth and everything else will take over from all the businesses in our business districts But that's an effective way to get it out there at least Real quick to as many households as we can until the signs of change as councillor mock stated I mean even

1681
01:59:03,483 --> 01:59:05,924
[SPEAKER_05]: I was trying to be helpful to someone the other day in West Medford.

1682
01:59:06,404 --> 01:59:13,829
[SPEAKER_05]: The gentleman was a Saturday night, my wife and I were on the way to Medford Square, and there was a guy in West Medford, 6.30, putting his money in the machine.

1683
01:59:15,490 --> 01:59:22,415
[SPEAKER_05]: And I turned, we pulled over, the machine's on, sign right here says 7 o'clock, they're going to Bistro 5 or something, they're all dressed up.

1684
01:59:23,936 --> 01:59:29,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not gonna argue with the guy, I'm trying to do him a favor, he's getting argumentative with me that I'm telling him that the thing's off at 6, so.

1685
01:59:30,080 --> 01:59:31,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Meantime, I come down the square,

1686
01:59:32,233 --> 01:59:37,034
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just go up to see if it will accept the money, because this has been a topic that's been discussed here at the council.

1687
01:59:37,334 --> 01:59:42,355
[SPEAKER_05]: And it did take my money until 7 o'clock, and then it shut off, maximum amount of time allowed.

1688
01:59:43,035 --> 01:59:45,795
[SPEAKER_05]: So it can be done, if we can get an update.

1689
01:59:45,895 --> 01:59:52,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully it's done prior to the meeting you're going to call next week for reprogramming these machines, and also reverse 911 call to get it out there.

1690
01:59:53,557 --> 01:59:55,377
[SPEAKER_16]: Point of information, Mr. President.

1691
01:59:55,597 --> 01:59:56,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Point of information, Councilor Marks.

1692
01:59:57,337 --> 02:00:01,798
[SPEAKER_16]: Considering, Mr. President, that this particular company has the plates,

1693
02:00:03,122 --> 02:00:07,905
[SPEAKER_16]: of everyone that fed the meter from six to seven, it can reimburse these people.

1694
02:00:08,005 --> 02:00:17,712
[SPEAKER_16]: I would offer that as, as a motion that, uh, since this was implemented, that people receive reimbursement if they fed the meter from six to seven, Mr. President.

1695
02:00:18,012 --> 02:00:20,474
[SPEAKER_16]: And it's at no fault of the residents of this community.

1696
02:00:20,874 --> 02:00:25,738
[SPEAKER_16]: It's the fault of, uh, Republic and this administration too, Mr. President.

1697
02:00:26,098 --> 02:00:31,962
[SPEAKER_14]: So, so on the main motion of the reverse to, I'm sorry, Penta,

1698
02:00:32,688 --> 02:00:41,996
[SPEAKER_14]: for approval amended by Councillor Marks, Councillor Camuso and again by Councillors Marks and Vice President Lungo Kern.

1699
02:00:42,136 --> 02:00:46,280
[SPEAKER_05]: I can support that but I think they purge all the information according to the contract.

1700
02:00:46,320 --> 02:00:48,241
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to purge anything that's not a violation.

1701
02:00:49,382 --> 02:00:52,704
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll support it in theory, but I would be surprised if they can actually do it.

1702
02:00:52,724 --> 02:00:54,184
[SPEAKER_05]: But I understand why you want to do it.

1703
02:00:54,845 --> 02:01:00,307
[SPEAKER_16]: I would doubt if I could, I would doubt that they're purging anything if they're not able to turn the machines off in the right time.

1704
02:01:00,347 --> 02:01:03,789
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm not sure what they're doing to be honest with you.

1705
02:01:03,829 --> 02:01:07,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information and councilor Camuso is all set.

1706
02:01:08,251 --> 02:01:08,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, yeah.

1707
02:01:08,851 --> 02:01:15,975
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we could ask the administration to do the 911 reverse 911 call as well as reprogram the machines, the company reprogrammed the machines.

1708
02:01:16,580 --> 02:01:19,861
[SPEAKER_05]: Fort Worth and refunds if you can do it.

1709
02:01:20,222 --> 02:01:21,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Carviello.

1710
02:01:21,902 --> 02:01:22,743
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1711
02:01:23,523 --> 02:01:31,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, now that snow is all gone, I think it's time that we stripe the parking spots where the parking is.

1712
02:01:32,086 --> 02:01:34,327
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the signs are very confusing.

1713
02:01:34,547 --> 02:01:36,108
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea where these free spots are.

1714
02:01:37,068 --> 02:01:38,189
[SPEAKER_07]: I look for them and I don't know.

1715
02:01:38,209 --> 02:01:41,810
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I've seen, I mean, I see 30 minutes pay meter.

1716
02:01:42,070 --> 02:01:45,572
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if that's, if I can park there for 30 minutes or I got to pay for 30 minutes.

1717
02:01:45,612 --> 02:01:45,752
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean,

1718
02:01:46,113 --> 02:01:49,036
[SPEAKER_07]: There's nothing that says free parking.

1719
02:01:50,297 --> 02:01:52,800
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll give you my own little story today.

1720
02:01:52,820 --> 02:01:59,386
[SPEAKER_07]: I was in the square, I went, I parked, and I come out and I see the gentleman standing at my car.

1721
02:02:01,068 --> 02:02:05,292
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of wait, and I look, I said, geez, I said, I look at my ticket, and I got a few more minutes left.

1722
02:02:05,833 --> 02:02:09,897
[SPEAKER_07]: So I walk up to the guy, and he's punching my thing in, he says,

1723
02:02:10,692 --> 02:02:12,113
[SPEAKER_07]: I said, listen, I still got a couple more minutes.

1724
02:02:12,193 --> 02:02:13,314
[SPEAKER_07]: He said, Oh yeah, I know.

1725
02:02:13,574 --> 02:02:16,015
[SPEAKER_07]: He was standing, he was waiting for my two minutes to expire.

1726
02:02:16,035 --> 02:02:17,216
[SPEAKER_07]: And then he was going to write me up a ticket.

1727
02:02:19,137 --> 02:02:22,219
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he was following me.

1728
02:02:22,520 --> 02:02:23,740
[SPEAKER_07]: The signs are confusing.

1729
02:02:24,741 --> 02:02:27,163
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, you know, they're, they're, they're, they're still saying seven to seven.

1730
02:02:27,183 --> 02:02:29,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, you don't know what spots are free.

1731
02:02:30,545 --> 02:02:34,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, you know, it's very confusing and I know they're still taking money on Sundays.

1732
02:02:34,287 --> 02:02:38,410
[SPEAKER_14]: Amended by councilor Caviello.

1733
02:02:40,116 --> 02:02:43,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight, point of further information, Councilor Banta.

1734
02:02:43,839 --> 02:02:48,163
[SPEAKER_19]: The sign here, Councilor Caviello, the sign says 30-minute limit parking.

1735
02:02:48,623 --> 02:02:49,324
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but is that free?

1736
02:02:49,544 --> 02:02:49,684
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1737
02:02:49,964 --> 02:02:52,366
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, those are the two- It says pay META.

1738
02:02:52,546 --> 02:03:02,034
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks to Councilor Marks, those are the two free 30-minute parking that at the last, I think it was March 3rd or March 15th at the Traffic Commission, they now put them in all four squares.

1739
02:03:02,415 --> 02:03:03,836
[SPEAKER_19]: So you see the signs there.

1740
02:03:03,856 --> 02:03:05,417
[SPEAKER_07]: But they say 30 minutes pay META.

1741
02:03:05,677 --> 02:03:06,738
[SPEAKER_19]: No, this says 30-minute parking.

1742
02:03:09,279 --> 02:03:11,361
[SPEAKER_19]: And then it says Monday through Saturday, 7 a.m.

1743
02:03:11,401 --> 02:03:12,922
[SPEAKER_19]: to 7 p.m.

1744
02:03:12,962 --> 02:03:14,163
[SPEAKER_07]: People think they gotta pay the meter.

1745
02:03:14,183 --> 02:03:14,964
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't say free.

1746
02:03:15,945 --> 02:03:17,966
[SPEAKER_07]: People are parking there and they're paying the meter.

1747
02:03:18,106 --> 02:03:19,348
[SPEAKER_19]: That's what a bounty hunter does.

1748
02:03:19,568 --> 02:03:21,289
[SPEAKER_19]: Gets as much as they can when they can.

1749
02:03:21,649 --> 02:03:23,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Pay the meter where it says pay the meter.

1750
02:03:23,851 --> 02:03:25,773
[SPEAKER_14]: Counselor Knight.

1751
02:03:30,017 --> 02:03:32,058
[SPEAKER_14]: Sir, you wish to address us.

1752
02:03:32,158 --> 02:03:33,700
[SPEAKER_14]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1753
02:03:33,720 --> 02:03:34,180
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening.

1754
02:03:34,240 --> 02:03:36,902
[SPEAKER_12]: Anthony D'Antonio, 12 Yale Street, Medford.

1755
02:03:38,352 --> 02:03:46,475
[SPEAKER_12]: The magic word I saw in Mr. Councilor Penta's motion was kiosk, and there's many problems with the parking program as it exists.

1756
02:03:46,535 --> 02:03:54,018
[SPEAKER_12]: However, all I'm here for right now, because it was an intro for me to come up here and speak, is a suggestion to the City Council.

1757
02:03:54,298 --> 02:03:57,959
[SPEAKER_12]: What I would like to see, you know we've had one bad winter.

1758
02:03:59,020 --> 02:04:02,241
[SPEAKER_12]: Everybody, every business owner has been affected one way or the other.

1759
02:04:02,801 --> 02:04:05,062
[SPEAKER_12]: We've had this parking program that's been implemented.

1760
02:04:05,522 --> 02:04:07,203
[SPEAKER_12]: The residents have been impacted by it.

1761
02:04:08,068 --> 02:04:16,132
[SPEAKER_12]: There isn't one business, 80% of the businesses out there have been affected negatively in remuneration for their work.

1762
02:04:16,252 --> 02:04:17,533
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's been terrible.

1763
02:04:18,293 --> 02:04:24,396
[SPEAKER_12]: I know some people in business, and they're hurting, and the winter didn't help, and the implementation of the parking program didn't help.

1764
02:04:25,657 --> 02:04:26,457
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a suggestion.

1765
02:04:28,498 --> 02:04:36,662
[SPEAKER_12]: Can this council, through a vote or whatever, say, okay, we've got a very special weekend coming up,

1766
02:04:37,799 --> 02:04:38,379
[SPEAKER_12]: What do we say?

1767
02:04:38,419 --> 02:04:48,766
[SPEAKER_12]: We knock off the parking enforcement Friday and Saturday so that the vendors and the businesses that do a lot of the business, especially on this coming holiday weekend, get a little bit back.

1768
02:04:48,786 --> 02:04:57,212
[SPEAKER_12]: I think the city owes it to them because you can't do anything about the snow, but we can certainly do something about this terribly implemented parking program because it wasn't ready.

1769
02:04:57,232 --> 02:04:58,473
[SPEAKER_12]: It was not ready for prime time.

1770
02:04:59,274 --> 02:05:05,578
[SPEAKER_12]: And if anybody should get a ticket, then on the, uh, onus of Republic that they,

1771
02:05:06,462 --> 02:05:13,126
[SPEAKER_12]: not only reimbursed, I just canceled the tickets out, but give the people a chance to do some shopping again.

1772
02:05:13,166 --> 02:05:16,207
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's like a ghost town out there, you know, on Saturday.

1773
02:05:16,528 --> 02:05:18,589
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, a week ago, we had the leprechaun race.

1774
02:05:18,609 --> 02:05:19,549
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a great cause.

1775
02:05:19,569 --> 02:05:31,116
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that's, I have no qualms with that, but maybe the next time, maybe do it on a Sunday or something, because that also affected the businesses because I didn't realize the enormity of the blockages to get into the square.

1776
02:05:31,216 --> 02:05:33,977
[SPEAKER_12]: Usually I can, I can get into the square by all the sides.

1777
02:05:33,997 --> 02:05:35,238
[SPEAKER_12]: They had everything blocked.

1778
02:05:36,594 --> 02:05:43,536
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a good event, but then again, it also affects other people, the same way as the bridge is going to affect a lot of the store owners.

1779
02:05:44,116 --> 02:05:47,137
[SPEAKER_12]: And I still want to see why they want to put the bridge there.

1780
02:05:48,538 --> 02:05:50,318
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to see where the safety issues are.

1781
02:05:50,598 --> 02:05:51,939
[SPEAKER_12]: Why are we letting buses go over it?

1782
02:05:51,999 --> 02:05:53,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Why are we letting trailer trucks go over it?

1783
02:05:54,219 --> 02:05:57,740
[SPEAKER_12]: There are safety issues there, but I think they can be corrected.

1784
02:05:57,941 --> 02:06:05,663
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to get too off the subject, but we ought to send state engineers over to Rome and have them take a look at the Coliseum, what they're doing in rebuilding the Coliseum.

1785
02:06:06,416 --> 02:06:07,717
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's incredible.

1786
02:06:08,057 --> 02:06:11,420
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't agree with what's going on with the state, with this program.

1787
02:06:11,440 --> 02:06:16,124
[SPEAKER_12]: But anyway, the thought was just to see if we can do something for the people this weekend.

1788
02:06:16,564 --> 02:06:19,607
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll have Barry Clemente give a little tune.

1789
02:06:20,808 --> 02:06:21,008
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1790
02:06:21,568 --> 02:06:21,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1791
02:06:22,009 --> 02:06:23,350
[SPEAKER_13]: Ma'am, you wish to address the council.

1792
02:06:23,590 --> 02:06:25,091
[SPEAKER_13]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1793
02:06:25,291 --> 02:06:25,712
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1794
02:06:25,772 --> 02:06:26,852
[SPEAKER_01]: Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

1795
02:06:27,273 --> 02:06:36,080
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to say two things, which is number one, how you can have a meeting without the principal person who signs the contracts

1796
02:06:36,530 --> 02:06:43,635
[SPEAKER_01]: is, you know, why are we doing this again where you're setting up the fall guy to be the chief of police again?

1797
02:06:44,016 --> 02:06:45,237
[SPEAKER_01]: So he takes all the heat.

1798
02:06:46,037 --> 02:06:52,182
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, I mean, I know why you guys know that you have to do it this way, but why are the people putting up with this?

1799
02:06:52,522 --> 02:06:56,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are the people not getting behind the chief of police and saying, look, he's got enough to do?

1800
02:06:57,699 --> 02:07:05,806
[SPEAKER_01]: doing his job, why isn't the mayor, who is the responsible party for this, the one taking the heat for his own program?

1801
02:07:05,866 --> 02:07:07,227
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the one that signed the contract.

1802
02:07:07,988 --> 02:07:08,288
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?

1803
02:07:08,869 --> 02:07:09,749
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just number one.

1804
02:07:10,210 --> 02:07:13,072
[SPEAKER_01]: And number two, because it's just not fair.

1805
02:07:13,092 --> 02:07:13,613
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not right.

1806
02:07:13,713 --> 02:07:15,114
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not the way it should be done.

1807
02:07:15,655 --> 02:07:17,436
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not fair as relative.

1808
02:07:20,263 --> 02:07:24,764
[SPEAKER_01]: The mayor uses his administration as the fall guys, and then he makes deals with them.

1809
02:07:26,064 --> 02:07:32,585
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people need to just start calling the mayor and tell him to show up to these meetings, because he's the one that signed the contract.

1810
02:07:32,965 --> 02:07:34,446
[SPEAKER_01]: He's the principal party here.

1811
02:07:34,866 --> 02:07:36,226
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't the chief of police.

1812
02:07:36,786 --> 02:07:40,247
[SPEAKER_01]: He has enough to do dealing with an understaffed police station.

1813
02:07:40,267 --> 02:07:42,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like, why is he doing the favors for the mayor?

1814
02:07:43,007 --> 02:07:48,348
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, because he's dealing with a building that's 50 years old, and he's dealing with an understaffed police department.

1815
02:07:49,134 --> 02:07:55,503
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, the other part of the problem that I see is why is Diane McLeod the ticket person?

1816
02:07:56,144 --> 02:08:00,230
[SPEAKER_01]: She's in charge of multiculturalism or whatever, diversity or something like that.

1817
02:08:01,030 --> 02:08:04,033
[SPEAKER_01]: What does diversity have to do with parking tickets?

1818
02:08:04,694 --> 02:08:09,338
[SPEAKER_01]: And why, again, did she take that responsibility on when it's completely non-related?

1819
02:08:10,039 --> 02:08:19,428
[SPEAKER_01]: Why isn't it in the position of the, I don't know, police department or something, put a captain on it, somebody that understands the policies of public parking.

1820
02:08:20,109 --> 02:08:25,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Put one of the captains on it, put, you know, something, I don't know, hire a guy.

1821
02:08:26,549 --> 02:08:28,310
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it, hire a person to do it.

1822
02:08:28,831 --> 02:08:33,034
[SPEAKER_01]: If that's what you want to do and you're going to make all this money, then make that part of the deal.

1823
02:08:33,194 --> 02:08:36,897
[SPEAKER_01]: Give them $20,000 a year part-time to take on parking tickets.

1824
02:08:37,398 --> 02:08:45,444
[SPEAKER_01]: But why is Diane McLeod, the diversity person in charge of ticket judgments, makes no sense?

1825
02:08:46,044 --> 02:08:48,566
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a reason for that behind the scenes that we don't know.

1826
02:08:48,947 --> 02:08:49,667
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I got to say.

1827
02:08:49,888 --> 02:08:50,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1828
02:08:52,750 --> 02:08:53,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, sir.

1829
02:08:53,771 --> 02:08:56,993
[SPEAKER_11]: You wish to address the council, please state your name and address for the record.

1830
02:08:57,533 --> 02:08:58,534
[SPEAKER_18]: My name is Michael Ruggiero.

1831
02:08:58,574 --> 02:08:59,894
[SPEAKER_18]: I live in 18 Pembroke Street.

1832
02:09:00,615 --> 02:09:21,288
[SPEAKER_18]: I would like to bring to the council's attention the part of the contract, the RFP attachment, page 17 report, subsection 16 AA, says that the Republic Parking has to provide daily, week, I'm quoting, daily, weekly, monthly, and annual field sortable reports

1833
02:09:22,000 --> 02:09:25,263
[SPEAKER_18]: summarizing all citation, boot, tow, collection, repayment activity.

1834
02:09:26,444 --> 02:09:33,590
[SPEAKER_18]: As of right now, according, if they have delayed that reporting for over 60 days, they are in violation of their contract.

1835
02:09:34,010 --> 02:09:36,513
[SPEAKER_18]: They only have 30 days to actually report that information.

1836
02:09:37,213 --> 02:09:48,203
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, under the signage section, also from the RFP attachment, they are required, under section 12, signage.

1837
02:09:49,420 --> 02:09:54,424
[SPEAKER_18]: They are required to replace or repair missing damage signs within 48 hours.

1838
02:09:55,125 --> 02:09:58,528
[SPEAKER_18]: So they are also responsible to maintain signs.

1839
02:09:59,528 --> 02:10:09,296
[SPEAKER_18]: If they are in violation of the contract, which appears to me, just from what we've heard and what's been said so far, then if they don't fix it in 30 days, they have to leave.

1840
02:10:09,997 --> 02:10:10,197
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks.

1841
02:10:19,698 --> 02:10:21,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Will the clerk please read the amendments back?

1842
02:10:22,220 --> 02:10:27,583
[SPEAKER_10]: The clerk is going to read the amendments back.

1843
02:10:29,584 --> 02:10:32,686
[SPEAKER_10]: So 15.323 is what we're working off of here, is that correct?

1844
02:10:32,726 --> 02:10:40,171
[SPEAKER_14]: We are dealing with 15.323 offered by Councilor Penta.

1845
02:10:40,311 --> 02:10:44,654
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have a reverse 9-1-1 amendment, a reprogramming amendment, a refunds amendment?

1846
02:10:45,677 --> 02:11:13,260
[SPEAKER_09]: uh... we get the reprogramming of the uh... kiosks and creating a refund uh... reshaping parking spots uh... let me see this one here is uh... more related to the electricity side uh... report back on the

1847
02:11:14,513 --> 02:11:29,484
[SPEAKER_09]: who is placing planters on the access boxes, and report back on the past outage at Riverside Avenue 2 years ago.

1848
02:11:43,267 --> 02:11:46,209
[SPEAKER_09]: That's on your regular resolution, isn't it?

1849
02:11:50,371 --> 02:11:52,872
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1850
02:11:52,912 --> 02:11:56,174
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Councillor Camuso.

1851
02:11:56,754 --> 02:12:00,816
[SPEAKER_05]: Could Councillor Penter introduce his resolutions by topic?

1852
02:12:00,856 --> 02:12:06,499
[SPEAKER_05]: Because first we've got the kiosk stuff, and then it's in with this one, and then we have the National Grid stuff.

1853
02:12:07,060 --> 02:12:11,222
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you be amenable to do that so we can... But it all happened this week.

1854
02:12:13,493 --> 02:12:41,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I understand but listen we did proper parliamentary procedure I must say so I would just rather vote on it it's like voting it just doesn't make sense the way we're taking a vote on this I'd like to at least break it down by topic you get National Grid you get the kiosks then you get the power outage it's we're all over the map here

1855
02:12:43,144 --> 02:12:44,685
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't we have something before us?

1856
02:12:44,765 --> 02:12:45,786
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's take it.

1857
02:12:46,206 --> 02:12:47,447
[SPEAKER_14]: We've gone through the amendments.

1858
02:12:48,087 --> 02:12:51,089
[SPEAKER_14]: So, on the motion of Councilor Pinto for approval.

1859
02:12:51,650 --> 02:12:52,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call.

1860
02:12:52,550 --> 02:12:55,332
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call vote has been requested by Councilor Camuso.

1861
02:12:56,072 --> 02:12:57,673
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1862

02:13:00,615 --> 02:13:01,416
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caviello.

[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1866
02:13:02,497 --> 02:13:03,077
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Knight.

1867
02:13:03,497 --> 02:13:04,598
[SPEAKER_10]: No, Mr. President.

1868
02:13:04,658 --> 02:13:09,101
[SPEAKER_10]: Please be recorded that I'm agreeing in theory, but I'm in opposition based on the language.

1869
02:13:10,181 --> 02:13:10,662
[SPEAKER_11]: So noted.

1870
02:13:12,625 --> 02:13:13,525
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have that Mr. Clerk?

1871
02:13:15,726 --> 02:13:16,706

02:13:20,186 --> 02:13:20,806
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Penta?

1876
02:13:20,966 --> 02:13:21,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1877
02:13:21,727 --> 02:13:22,567
[SPEAKER_09]: President Del Russo?

1878
02:13:23,507 --> 02:13:23,767
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1879
02:13:24,807 --> 02:13:36,129
[SPEAKER_14]: In the vote of five in the affirmative, two in the negative, the motion passes.

1880
02:13:36,169 --> 02:13:38,649
[SPEAKER_14]: Request of Councilor Penta to take 15307 off the table.

1881
02:13:42,337 --> 02:13:43,197
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1882
02:13:43,777 --> 02:13:45,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call has been requested on that.

1883
02:13:46,238 --> 02:13:49,498
[SPEAKER_14]: Roll call has been requested to take this item off the table.

1884
02:13:49,778 --> 02:13:53,419
[SPEAKER_05]: This was to suspend the contract last week.

1885
02:13:54,579 --> 02:13:56,639
[SPEAKER_14]: It was the motion to suspend the contract.

1886
02:13:57,480 --> 02:13:58,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Roll call to take it off the table.

1887
02:13:59,060 --> 02:14:05,561
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso to take the matter off the table, a yes vote would take it off the table.

1888
02:14:05,941 --> 02:14:07,461
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1889
02:14:08,021 --> 02:14:08,762
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Camuso?

1890
02:14:08,782 --> 02:14:09,062
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1891
02:14:09,942 --> 02:14:10,902
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Caviello?

1892
02:14:11,002 --> 02:14:11,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1893
02:14:12,078 --> 02:14:12,618

[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Lowell-Curry?

1896
02:14:15,841 --> 02:14:15,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1897
02:14:20,604 --> 02:14:21,225
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks?

1898
02:14:21,585 --> 02:14:21,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1899
02:14:22,206 --> 02:14:22,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Penta?

1900
02:14:22,746 --> 02:14:22,826
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1901
02:14:23,827 --> 02:14:24,687
[SPEAKER_09]: President DelaRusso?

1902
02:14:25,008 --> 02:14:25,188
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

1903
02:14:25,748 --> 02:14:27,750
[SPEAKER_14]: A vote of five in the affirmative, two in the negative.

1904
02:14:28,370 --> 02:14:29,451
[SPEAKER_14]: The matter is before us.

1905
02:14:32,593 --> 02:14:33,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Penta?

1906
02:14:34,014 --> 02:14:41,039
[SPEAKER_19]: Last week when we were discussing 15-307, there was a bunch of resolutions and amendments that were on there.

1907
02:14:43,121 --> 02:14:44,783
[SPEAKER_19]: One of the amendments reads as follows.

1908
02:14:44,843 --> 02:14:46,064
[SPEAKER_19]: It's offered by Councilor Knight.

1909
02:14:46,104 --> 02:14:56,313
[SPEAKER_19]: It says, amended by Councilor Knight, that a meeting be called with all the parties concerned as previously requested in 30 days and prior to that meeting within 14 days, the Council meeting to share their concerns, complaints, and recommendations.

1910
02:14:57,014 --> 02:15:00,497
[SPEAKER_19]: But if I understand it correctly, you, Mr. President, are going to be calling

1911
02:15:00,964 --> 02:15:02,445
[SPEAKER_19]: this meeting for next Tuesday night.

1912
02:15:02,505 --> 02:15:03,205
[SPEAKER_19]: Is that true?

1913
02:15:03,546 --> 02:15:05,647
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to probably do it for Wednesday night.

1914
02:15:05,707 --> 02:15:11,731
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have all the departments heads here and we're not at loggerheads with the council meeting itself.

1915
02:15:12,591 --> 02:15:15,413
[SPEAKER_03]: The 5.30 City Council meeting.

1916
02:15:15,713 --> 02:15:16,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry?

1917
02:15:16,133 --> 02:15:17,634
[SPEAKER_03]: 5.30 City Council meeting.

1918
02:15:18,375 --> 02:15:19,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Is next week?

1919
02:15:19,175 --> 02:15:19,636
[SPEAKER_03]: On Tuesday.

1920
02:15:20,256 --> 02:15:21,657
[SPEAKER_14]: Is on next Tuesday.

1921
02:15:21,677 --> 02:15:22,297
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's why.

1922
02:15:22,317 --> 02:15:24,759
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to be here.

1923
02:15:27,552 --> 02:15:31,014
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, I want to go to the amendments.

1924
02:15:51,816 --> 02:16:11,462
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'll be announcing, uh, by the end of this week, the, uh, schedule for the committee of the whole regarding, uh, the parking and inviting the, or requesting that the, uh, parking commission, uh, and others, uh, be present with us, uh, the floor to counsel Penta.

1925
02:16:11,802 --> 02:16:13,563
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to make sure everybody has enough time.

1926
02:16:13,583 --> 02:16:15,664
[SPEAKER_19]: So they can't say that they can't be here next week.

1927
02:16:16,024 --> 02:16:17,644
[SPEAKER_19]: They've got other commitments and stuff like that.

1928
02:16:18,144 --> 02:16:19,945
[SPEAKER_19]: So, um, with that being said,

1929
02:16:21,007 --> 02:16:42,656
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll be willing at this point in time to hold off on my resolution to opt out of the contract until that meeting takes place, but subsequent to that meeting, that resolution, Mr. President, I will once again reinduce that the city of Medford opt out of the, where's the wording here that says the following?

1930
02:16:43,896 --> 02:16:48,138
[SPEAKER_19]: It says, put it back on the table for the purposes of a vote.

1931
02:16:48,858 --> 02:16:48,958
[SPEAKER_19]: So.

1932
02:16:50,754 --> 02:16:51,654
[SPEAKER_19]: motion to table.

1933
02:16:52,274 --> 02:16:59,556
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I think it would be maybe just to leave this in the, we just took it off the table and we're going to put it back on the table.

1934
02:16:59,596 --> 02:17:04,576
[SPEAKER_19]: So that way there are parties that you want to put together at least have more than enough ample time.

1935
02:17:05,277 --> 02:17:10,157
[SPEAKER_19]: Everything that councilor Caviello was talking about these reports and everything, you know, and that, and that's it.

1936
02:17:11,398 --> 02:17:16,558
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm under the impression that the, uh, the per diem reports are generated automatically.

1937
02:17:16,638 --> 02:17:17,099
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.

1938
02:17:17,119 --> 02:17:18,459
[SPEAKER_14]: Go to the appropriate.

1939
02:17:18,479 --> 02:17:19,619
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we're not the, uh,

1940
02:17:20,328 --> 02:17:22,189
[SPEAKER_14]: organization that ought to receive them.

1941
02:17:22,269 --> 02:17:26,631
[SPEAKER_14]: So I mean, they're in the purview of enforcements or the police chief, and I'm sure.

1942
02:17:26,651 --> 02:17:28,872
[SPEAKER_19]: But you also have constant violations in the contract.

1943
02:17:28,932 --> 02:17:30,033
[SPEAKER_19]: And Mr. Leggero was correct.

1944
02:17:30,053 --> 02:17:32,174
[SPEAKER_19]: The two sites and sections that he announced.

1945
02:17:32,874 --> 02:17:41,058
[SPEAKER_19]: The fact that the cars aren't even.

1946
02:17:41,738 --> 02:17:42,719
[SPEAKER_19]: But we asked for them.

1947
02:17:44,639 --> 02:17:45,540
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1948
02:17:45,560 --> 02:17:49,422
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if they're our business, but in any event, there's a motion to put this back on the table.

1949
02:17:49,442 --> 02:17:50,102
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

1950
02:17:50,748 --> 02:17:51,488
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

1951
02:17:52,409 --> 02:17:53,249
[SPEAKER_14]: Back on the table.

1952
02:17:54,469 --> 02:17:57,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Revert back to the regular order of business.

1953
02:17:57,270 --> 02:17:58,370
[SPEAKER_14]: 15-3-28.

1954
02:17:58,390 --> 02:18:04,312
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh no, 15-3-24, offered by Councilor Caviello.

1955
02:18:05,053 --> 02:18:13,315
[SPEAKER_14]: Be it resolved that the Medford City Council offer condolences to the family of Sam Roslando, good man, who passed away after a long illness.

1956
02:18:13,835 --> 02:18:18,837
[SPEAKER_14]: Sam was longtime director of the Metro Youth Hockey and was active in other

1957
02:18:19,495 --> 02:18:24,179
[SPEAKER_14]: uh, various youth activities and, uh, quite the sailor.

1958
02:18:25,019 --> 02:18:25,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1959
02:18:25,780 --> 02:18:29,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, you know, those who knew Sam, um, I've known Sam for many years.

1960
02:18:29,403 --> 02:18:31,164
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, our kids grew up together.

1961
02:18:31,184 --> 02:18:35,547
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, uh, Paul and, uh, Councilor Camuso and Councilor Knight, they knew him from Utah.

1962
02:18:35,608 --> 02:18:40,051
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, he was the guy that started the concession stand on the rink when no one else wanted to do it.

1963
02:18:40,091 --> 02:18:43,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Sam took it on on his own and built it up into what it is today.

1964
02:18:43,674 --> 02:18:47,737
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, he was active in little league and law, anything to do with the kids.

1965
02:18:48,578 --> 02:18:51,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Sam was always there for her.

1966
02:18:51,301 --> 02:18:57,908
[SPEAKER_07]: He had an illness a couple of years ago that held him down, but he was an avid boater, and again, passed away last week.

1967
02:18:58,549 --> 02:19:00,571
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we could have a moment of silence for him.

1968
02:19:01,051 --> 02:19:01,372
[SPEAKER_14]: I appreciate it.

1969
02:19:01,392 --> 02:19:07,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Please stand for a moment of silence for the repose of the soul of Sam Roslando.

1970
02:19:22,704 --> 02:19:31,948
[SPEAKER_14]: 15-328 petition by Joe Viglione of 59 Garfield Avenue, Medford Mass to address the council about new community media platform.

1971
02:19:32,548 --> 02:19:33,489
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Viglione.

1972
02:19:34,389 --> 02:19:35,670
[SPEAKER_04]: Good evening, city council.

1973
02:19:36,450 --> 02:19:42,853
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, last Thursday was the final date of submission for a proposal for the access television station.

1974
02:19:47,195 --> 02:19:50,217
[SPEAKER_04]: I take that as a vote of, um, no confidence.

1975
02:19:51,097 --> 02:19:51,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh,

1976
02:19:51,927 --> 02:19:56,628
[SPEAKER_04]: On March 26th, only one entity submitted a proposal to City Hall.

1977
02:19:57,649 --> 02:20:03,350
[SPEAKER_04]: And I heard from an AXS TV veteran today that the other cities and towns around here are afraid of Medford.

1978
02:20:03,370 --> 02:20:05,111
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the exact terminology.

1979
02:20:05,131 --> 02:20:14,033
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, well, they should be afraid of the mayor because the restrictions being put on this new station are something that the old regime didn't have to adhere to.

1980
02:20:14,133 --> 02:20:20,695
[SPEAKER_04]: So while they've yet to be punished, we have these really strict rules for

1981
02:20:21,104 --> 02:20:22,164
[SPEAKER_04]: the next access station.

1982
02:20:22,184 --> 02:20:25,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I have a four-point plan for access TV in the city.

1983
02:20:26,745 --> 02:20:27,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Number one is education.

1984
02:20:29,185 --> 02:20:30,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Number two is community involvement.

1985
02:20:31,566 --> 02:20:36,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three is use of technology at home integrated with the TV station.

1986
02:20:37,147 --> 02:20:42,328
[SPEAKER_04]: And number four is recouping monies from the previous nonprofit, if any monies are due.

1987
02:20:43,808 --> 02:20:48,329
[SPEAKER_04]: The station is a hub, a meeting place for the arts community, for all the sports in town,

1988
02:20:48,900 --> 02:20:50,821
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear from so many people involved in sports.

1989
02:20:50,941 --> 02:20:57,163
[SPEAKER_04]: You know John from Medford, famous TV and radio calling host, host and caller.

1990
02:20:57,823 --> 02:21:03,566
[SPEAKER_04]: He's, he's, you know, number one, but there's Tony Bova's hockey games and Chris Donovan's out there.

1991
02:21:04,186 --> 02:21:05,326
[SPEAKER_04]: He came back very excited.

1992
02:21:05,346 --> 02:21:06,407
[SPEAKER_04]: He couldn't be here last week.

1993
02:21:06,427 --> 02:21:08,007
[SPEAKER_04]: He was doing his dad thing.

1994
02:21:08,427 --> 02:21:11,068
[SPEAKER_04]: He said he was very excited about the sports event he was at.

1995
02:21:11,789 --> 02:21:15,450
[SPEAKER_04]: These people are craving to put the sports of Medford

1996
02:21:16,962 --> 02:21:18,782
[SPEAKER_04]: on public access television.

1997
02:21:19,763 --> 02:21:28,204
[SPEAKER_04]: So when the city solicitor, who I think is a great guy, and we get along wonderfully, but I was in his office and he goes, Joe, you know, to me, public access is obsolete.

1998
02:21:28,224 --> 02:21:32,625
[SPEAKER_04]: And I quickly responded, Mark, education is never obsolete.

1999
02:21:32,685 --> 02:21:34,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I've said it here before.

2000
02:21:34,246 --> 02:21:34,886
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to say it again.

2001
02:21:34,946 --> 02:21:37,446
[SPEAKER_04]: This new media station is going to be heavy on education.

2002
02:21:38,126 --> 02:21:38,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Computers.

2003
02:21:39,607 --> 02:21:40,847
[SPEAKER_04]: In Stoneham, where I'm a member,

2004
02:21:41,520 --> 02:21:45,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Amy, the executive director, and she's also on the Mass Access board, and I'm a member of Mass Access.

2005
02:21:46,201 --> 02:21:56,204
[SPEAKER_04]: She goes to the senior center just about weekly, and they have laptop computers with the Final Cut Pro program, and she's at the senior center teaching the seniors of Stoneham.

2006
02:21:56,684 --> 02:22:00,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, as Access is flourishing in Newton, you cannot get a show on in Newton.

2007
02:22:01,706 --> 02:22:07,827
[SPEAKER_04]: Boston, Somerville, Cambridge, Burlington, Malden, it's flourishing.

2008
02:22:08,027 --> 02:22:10,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Here in Medford, the mayor will say, well, no one's interested.

2009
02:22:11,425 --> 02:22:12,486
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Your Honor.

2010
02:22:13,226 --> 02:22:14,928
[SPEAKER_04]: People have been beaten down.

2011
02:22:14,988 --> 02:22:15,868
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been ridiculed.

2012
02:22:15,888 --> 02:22:17,489
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been harassed, including counselors.

2013
02:22:18,550 --> 02:22:22,353
[SPEAKER_04]: And all we wanted to do was to do what happens in other communities.

2014
02:22:23,193 --> 02:22:25,295
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to bring that to Medford.

2015
02:22:26,155 --> 02:22:33,841
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm looking for anyone in the arts, anyone from any walk of life to support me, because we will build a new access station.

2016
02:22:33,861 --> 02:22:36,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, the mayor wanted a corporation already in place.

2017
02:22:37,816 --> 02:22:44,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I could have put the money down and built a corporation, but then if we don't get awarded the contract, I'm out all that money.

2018
02:22:44,861 --> 02:22:50,446
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was another restriction that really was kind of not Medford friendly.

2019
02:22:51,607 --> 02:22:55,510
[SPEAKER_04]: And the second part with my discussion with Mark Rumley was we're already paying for this.

2020
02:22:56,370 --> 02:23:01,254
[SPEAKER_04]: As a counselor noted earlier, this $300,000 or more, we're paying for this service.

2021
02:23:01,314 --> 02:23:05,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Now I'm here tonight because last week was the submission date.

2022
02:23:05,726 --> 02:23:09,569
[SPEAKER_04]: And Arthur DeLuca from the old regime was out there and he said, you are the only one.

2023
02:23:10,349 --> 02:23:12,090
[SPEAKER_04]: So I held back.

2024
02:23:12,150 --> 02:23:14,312
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to get Somerville involved and they were interested.

2025
02:23:15,652 --> 02:23:19,835
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, um, there were other entities that were interested.

2026
02:23:20,275 --> 02:23:24,018
[SPEAKER_04]: Malden was interested, but for some reason they backed off.

2027
02:23:24,098 --> 02:23:27,920
[SPEAKER_04]: So I waited till last minute cause I was trying to get corporations involved.

2028
02:23:28,821 --> 02:23:30,122
[SPEAKER_04]: The restrictions were too great.

2029
02:23:30,222 --> 02:23:35,365
[SPEAKER_04]: As I heard from an insider, they are afraid of Medford after all.

2030
02:23:36,013 --> 02:23:37,814
[SPEAKER_04]: of the horrible stuff that went down.

2031
02:23:37,854 --> 02:23:39,155
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just afraid to come in here.

2032
02:23:40,115 --> 02:23:49,860
[SPEAKER_04]: And the mayor likes that because when he goes up for election, November 3rd, in a little bit more than 200 days, Mr. D'Antonio won't be able to go on TV and talk about issues.

2033
02:23:50,100 --> 02:23:51,080
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no TV to go on.

2034
02:23:51,120 --> 02:23:51,841
[SPEAKER_04]: There's color bars.

2035
02:23:52,441 --> 02:24:01,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, if you read carefully the contract, and I urge all members of the city council to go down to the clerk's office and look at the Comcast Xfinity book.

2036
02:24:02,183 --> 02:24:06,329
[SPEAKER_04]: My reading of the contract is—now, correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think it was in there 10 years ago.

2037
02:24:07,010 --> 02:24:10,254
[SPEAKER_04]: Comcast has the right to take away a channel not being used.

2038
02:24:10,815 --> 02:24:13,058
[SPEAKER_04]: This is very, very suspicious.

2039
02:24:13,118 --> 02:24:14,720
[SPEAKER_04]: We need channel 3 for our access.

2040
02:24:14,760 --> 02:24:15,761
[SPEAKER_04]: We've suffered long enough.

2041
02:24:16,825 --> 02:24:17,645
[SPEAKER_04]: There should be hockey.

2042
02:24:18,106 --> 02:24:19,106
[SPEAKER_04]: There should be baseball.

2043
02:24:19,706 --> 02:24:24,149
[SPEAKER_04]: When you counselors bring our wonderful sports teams up here and congratulate them, think about this.

2044
02:24:24,969 --> 02:24:32,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you congratulating them, but I would also like to have DVDs of them performing on the football field, on the soccer field.

2045
02:24:32,513 --> 02:24:39,597
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would like those DVDs at the library because Burlington Public Library has my interview with Jojo White.

2046
02:24:39,637 --> 02:24:43,019
[SPEAKER_04]: He's my current show that's going out right now, Jojo White of the Boston Celtics.

2047
02:24:43,579 --> 02:24:44,699
[SPEAKER_04]: So I interviewed Jojo White.

2048
02:24:44,899 --> 02:24:45,780
[SPEAKER_04]: We taped his lecture.

2049
02:24:46,413 --> 02:24:48,553
[SPEAKER_04]: It was done along with Haverhill TV.

2050
02:24:50,154 --> 02:24:51,674
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is now at the Burlington Library.

2051
02:24:51,714 --> 02:24:54,674
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyone can walk into the Burlington Library, see the library lecture.

2052
02:24:56,035 --> 02:24:57,275
[SPEAKER_04]: It's on Burlington Cable right now.

2053
02:24:57,335 --> 02:24:58,355
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going up on Stoneham.

2054
02:24:58,395 --> 02:24:59,835
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going up to my 24 stations.

2055
02:24:59,895 --> 02:25:02,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be having hundreds of stations as I've joined Mass Access.

2056
02:25:02,916 --> 02:25:04,516
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we upload to Mass Access.

2057
02:25:05,036 --> 02:25:10,377
[SPEAKER_04]: Stations around the Commonwealth can now take my programming, download it, and broadcast it, or cable cast it.

2058
02:25:10,897 --> 02:25:13,418
[SPEAKER_04]: This is wonderful stuff that I want to teach this community.

2059
02:25:13,458 --> 02:25:15,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you know I've got close to 40 years in this.

2060
02:25:16,862 --> 02:25:19,643
[SPEAKER_04]: And I didn't want to run the access station.

2061
02:25:19,663 --> 02:25:21,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm only doing this as my civic duty.

2062
02:25:21,983 --> 02:25:23,563
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to help the whole community out.

2063
02:25:23,804 --> 02:25:24,944
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I'm doing it for.

2064
02:25:25,104 --> 02:25:28,345
[SPEAKER_04]: I want my show on the air, but no one else is doing it.

2065
02:25:28,405 --> 02:25:29,905
[SPEAKER_04]: I want everyone's show on the air.

2066
02:25:30,605 --> 02:25:31,725
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are my four points.

2067
02:25:31,765 --> 02:25:38,687
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will just wrap it up and just say the use of technology at home, the community involvement, the education.

2068
02:25:39,327 --> 02:25:43,908
[SPEAKER_04]: And the final thing I will say is in my hand today is the Lincam

2069
02:25:44,581 --> 02:25:47,082
[SPEAKER_04]: lawsuit, which goes to court April 2nd, Thursday.

2070
02:25:48,922 --> 02:25:53,724
[SPEAKER_04]: Chilling, if you read it, and I gave the city council, every member of the city council has four pages from this.

2071
02:25:53,844 --> 02:26:06,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I specifically want you and the mayor and Mark Rumley to look at the term fiduciary duty and read page 29, altering, defacing, destroying, transferring, or disposing of any records, books, accounts.

2072
02:26:06,568 --> 02:26:07,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, wait a minute.

2073
02:26:08,549 --> 02:26:09,770
[SPEAKER_04]: We know there were no meeting minutes.

2074
02:26:11,130 --> 02:26:13,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, law enforcement's looking at TV3, but here you go, people.

2075
02:26:14,396 --> 02:26:15,256
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the precedent.

2076
02:26:16,657 --> 02:26:21,119
[SPEAKER_04]: They have no books, and they think they can just walk away without telling the community what they did.

2077
02:26:21,779 --> 02:26:31,043
[SPEAKER_04]: If I have the honor of running this station, one of my priorities after the education is to try to recoup the monies and try to get to the bottom of the TV3 mess.

2078
02:26:31,784 --> 02:26:32,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

2079
02:26:32,764 --> 02:26:33,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President?

2080
02:26:34,185 --> 02:26:35,025
[SPEAKER_14]: Councillor Camuso.

2081
02:26:36,786 --> 02:26:39,867
[SPEAKER_05]: The gentleman just stated that the bid deadline, I believe, was last week.

2082
02:26:40,448 --> 02:26:41,008
[SPEAKER_05]: If we could ask

2083
02:26:41,882 --> 02:26:48,989
[SPEAKER_05]: the procurement department, as well as the solicitor, if there was any qualified bidders, number one, and who they were.

2084
02:26:49,670 --> 02:26:56,377
[SPEAKER_05]: If at this point, I'm assuming it's public record if the bids were opened and if they're qualified and responsive to move forward.

2085
02:26:57,117 --> 02:26:58,779
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of Councilor Camuso.

2086
02:26:59,460 --> 02:27:01,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Ma'am, please state your name and address.

2087
02:27:01,722 --> 02:27:02,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Jean Martin, 10 Cumming Street.

2088
02:27:02,943 --> 02:27:04,405
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to say a couple of things.

2089
02:27:04,970 --> 02:27:09,331
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, the city has been, I say this every time, the city's out.

2090
02:27:09,731 --> 02:27:10,612
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we've lost.

2091
02:27:10,992 --> 02:27:16,173
[SPEAKER_01]: We've lost a whole history of like 20 years of this city because of the debacle.

2092
02:27:16,313 --> 02:27:17,813
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was under the mayor's regime.

2093
02:27:18,874 --> 02:27:21,995
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually have to use that word because that's basically what it is.

2094
02:27:22,295 --> 02:27:23,435
[SPEAKER_01]: It's his word and that's it.

2095
02:27:24,035 --> 02:27:29,137
[SPEAKER_01]: But that said, I'm sorry to say these guys got away with it.

2096
02:27:29,537 --> 02:27:32,697
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a waste of time because there's no money to be gotten to go after these guys.

2097
02:27:33,178 --> 02:27:34,638
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sad that they got away with it.

2098
02:27:35,173 --> 02:27:45,201
[SPEAKER_01]: But the mayor is still the mayor, and the mayor is responsible for at least what goes forward from here, from today forward.

2099
02:27:45,602 --> 02:27:49,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Or when that whole thing was done, he's definitely responsible.

2100
02:27:49,645 --> 02:27:59,313
[SPEAKER_01]: And he should be responsible, and he should own up to what he did, that he was neglectful in oversight of that debacle that cost us a bad reputation.

2101
02:28:00,023 --> 02:28:07,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just in the city of Medford, but in Malden and Somerville and Winchester and all the surrounding communities, we have a bad rep.

2102
02:28:07,466 --> 02:28:09,207
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I just heard from Joe.

2103
02:28:09,647 --> 02:28:10,647
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a bad rep out there.

2104
02:28:11,288 --> 02:28:12,668
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to take a lot to repair it.

2105
02:28:13,028 --> 02:28:22,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if we have to hire a professional, no offense, I don't, Joe is too involved from the old times, but I hope he has a show on the new one.

2106
02:28:23,092 --> 02:28:24,493
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope he gets a show on the new one.

2107
02:28:25,113 --> 02:28:43,032
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think an outside person, somebody that is completely unbiased, doesn't know a thing about the past, completely fresh, a fresh set of eyes coming from maybe even outside the city, coming in, hire them to get this thing started, to get it up on the media that's now popular.

2108
02:28:43,352 --> 02:28:45,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe it's not TV, maybe it's computers.

2109
02:28:46,139 --> 02:28:50,700
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it is, whatever the new technology is, have them get it up and running.

2110
02:28:51,180 --> 02:28:54,601
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have to hire somebody from the city, let's do that to get it done.

2111
02:28:55,161 --> 02:28:55,461
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2112
02:28:55,581 --> 02:28:56,581
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, and welcome back.

2113
02:28:57,101 --> 02:28:57,961
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Caviello.

2114
02:28:58,722 --> 02:28:59,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

2115
02:28:59,422 --> 02:29:14,685
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, seeing that if the deadline comes and goes and we have nobody, I still can't understand why the city can't change direction and hire a person to run a non-profit station for the city of Medford.

2116
02:29:16,238 --> 02:29:20,422
[SPEAKER_07]: We have one of the largest colleges in the country at Emerson University.

2117
02:29:20,802 --> 02:29:23,584
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all they do is produce TV shows.

2118
02:29:23,644 --> 02:29:27,268
[SPEAKER_07]: They're a factory for actors and producers.

2119
02:29:27,608 --> 02:29:30,110
[SPEAKER_07]: Boston University has a huge program.

2120
02:29:30,751 --> 02:29:35,415
[SPEAKER_07]: This state is one of the most technology-savvy states in the country.

2121
02:29:36,455 --> 02:29:42,441
[SPEAKER_07]: Why can't we hire a person to run the station if we can't find the company?

2122
02:29:42,861 --> 02:29:43,922
[SPEAKER_07]: There's money there to pay

2123
02:29:45,319 --> 02:29:49,202
[SPEAKER_07]: a competent person, a decent salary to run the station, Mr. President.

2124
02:29:49,882 --> 02:29:52,404
[SPEAKER_07]: If we can't get a company to come in there and do it.

2125
02:29:52,824 --> 02:29:56,447
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, there's going to be people that know how to run non-profits.

2126
02:29:57,908 --> 02:29:58,869
[SPEAKER_07]: They do this for a living.

2127
02:29:59,529 --> 02:30:00,670
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Councilor Kerrio.

2128
02:30:01,071 --> 02:30:01,791
[SPEAKER_19]: Councilor Pinto.

2129
02:30:02,412 --> 02:30:07,496
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think it's a matter of getting a non-profit person to run it or a for-profit person to run it.

2130
02:30:09,157 --> 02:30:10,938
[SPEAKER_14]: Point of information, Councilor Caruso.

2131
02:30:11,539 --> 02:30:14,301
[SPEAKER_05]: Public access cannot be for-profit according to

2132
02:30:14,727 --> 02:30:15,868
[SPEAKER_05]: the federal standards.

2133
02:30:17,049 --> 02:30:20,671
[SPEAKER_05]: And we will have something in writing on that from our city solicitor, I'm sure.

2134
02:30:20,791 --> 02:30:21,892
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe I said it wrong.

2135
02:30:21,912 --> 02:30:30,198
[SPEAKER_19]: What I'm saying, whether you have a non-profit or a for-profit company come in here, not to run public, to run an access channel.

2136
02:30:30,218 --> 02:30:36,122
[SPEAKER_19]: With that being said, I mean, there's absolutely no transparency.

2137
02:30:36,162 --> 02:30:43,547
[SPEAKER_19]: This council just got through voting last week, and we all agreed to it, that they may not go forward and sign any contract with Comcast until a public hearing takes place.

2138
02:30:44,407 --> 02:30:51,588
[SPEAKER_19]: Now, if I heard the gentleman correctly today, he was told that a fellow by the name of Peter Epstein is the only person that deals with this on behalf of the city.

2139
02:30:51,648 --> 02:30:58,029
[SPEAKER_19]: No, it's been three, it's going on three weeks, three and a half weeks now since the last time I spoke to Mr. Epstein and he called me back.

2140
02:30:58,529 --> 02:31:01,630
[SPEAKER_19]: He said he has not heard anything from anybody here in the city of Medford.

2141
02:31:02,250 --> 02:31:03,310
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, today's March 31st.

2142
02:31:04,050 --> 02:31:12,792
[SPEAKER_19]: We're dealing with 18 days because according to, from the letter from Xfinity Comcast, they want this thing signed on it before the 18th of April.

2143
02:31:13,502 --> 02:31:16,524
[SPEAKER_19]: How it got into the building, and nobody knows how it got here.

2144
02:31:16,724 --> 02:31:18,205
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not time-stamped or anything.

2145
02:31:19,046 --> 02:31:19,306
[SPEAKER_19]: Pardon me?

2146
02:31:21,728 --> 02:31:22,248
[SPEAKER_19]: No, no, no, no.

2147
02:31:24,290 --> 02:31:24,810
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, it could be.

2148
02:31:25,470 --> 02:31:32,435
[SPEAKER_19]: But this letter was dated December 18, and it was hand-delivered by UPS to the city of Medford.

2149
02:31:32,455 --> 02:31:38,459
[SPEAKER_19]: So I'm quite sure if somebody wanted to go to UPS, if they'd be willing, they'd be willing to tell you who signed for it.

2150
02:31:38,860 --> 02:31:39,720
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's not the point.

2151
02:31:39,760 --> 02:31:42,082
[SPEAKER_19]: The fact of the matter is we just found this out last week.

2152
02:31:44,008 --> 02:31:45,329
[SPEAKER_19]: This is absolutely crazy.

2153
02:31:45,609 --> 02:31:49,611
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, we haven't had public access in the city, I think, since December or November of 2013.

2154
02:31:50,571 --> 02:31:56,754
[SPEAKER_19]: And that means the last quarter of 2013, all of 14, now coming into 15.

2155
02:31:57,454 --> 02:32:00,335
[SPEAKER_19]: And during that period of time, that's when Verizon came into the picture.

2156
02:32:00,795 --> 02:32:02,776
[SPEAKER_19]: So not only do we have Verizon, we have Xfinity.

2157
02:32:03,516 --> 02:32:06,998
[SPEAKER_19]: But unfortunately, just think about it.

2158
02:32:07,318 --> 02:32:12,640
[SPEAKER_19]: Who in their right mind would want to make a bid to put a public access station up at the high school in the back?

2159
02:32:13,037 --> 02:32:15,779
[SPEAKER_19]: in the back end of the building where it's not on a main street.

2160
02:32:16,060 --> 02:32:25,588
[SPEAKER_19]: The mayor didn't even listen to his own three-member person that he had a panel and powered from February to March of this past year, February to Memorial Day.

2161
02:32:26,608 --> 02:32:31,232
[SPEAKER_19]: And the first thing, it has to be in a centrally located position.

2162
02:32:31,773 --> 02:32:40,220
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, behind the high school, up in the high school is not a centrally located position, especially if you have to get off the bus and it's dark at night, there's no protection there.

2163
02:32:40,662 --> 02:32:41,663
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's not the fact.

2164
02:32:41,703 --> 02:32:47,426
[SPEAKER_19]: The fact of the matter is this, that we as a council do have a voice, and the voice is this.

2165
02:32:48,067 --> 02:32:50,808
[SPEAKER_19]: It's unfortunate, but maybe it's the only voice that you can do.

2166
02:32:51,248 --> 02:32:52,409
[SPEAKER_19]: You have injunctive relief.

2167
02:32:52,469 --> 02:32:55,211
[SPEAKER_19]: This council can go into a mode of injunctive relief.

2168
02:32:55,631 --> 02:33:00,434
[SPEAKER_19]: This council can get a hold of 10 rate payers and ask them to go into a mode of injunctive relief.

2169
02:33:01,255 --> 02:33:08,499
[SPEAKER_19]: This council can stop the mayor in his tracks at budget time because he has not listened to the biggest issues that this council has been able to talk about.

2170
02:33:09,012 --> 02:33:12,555
[SPEAKER_19]: The priority of this council 2014 was a new police station.

2171
02:33:12,875 --> 02:33:16,037
[SPEAKER_19]: That was his number one priority and all seven of us agreed upon it.

2172
02:33:16,297 --> 02:33:23,183
[SPEAKER_19]: And you haven't seen one thing from that guy across the hall to respond back to a new police station by this council or any citizens.

2173
02:33:23,723 --> 02:33:30,028
[SPEAKER_19]: His only comment was through Mrs. Burke when she was down here, maybe in seven years, in seven years.

2174
02:33:31,405 --> 02:33:37,767
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, we'll all be out of here, gone someplace, and who knows what the financial condition of the community is going to be.

2175
02:33:38,288 --> 02:33:38,748
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

2176
02:33:39,408 --> 02:33:39,988
[SPEAKER_19]: None of us know.

2177
02:33:40,228 --> 02:33:45,290
[SPEAKER_19]: But you have $7.5 million sitting in a Water and Sewer account, but no indication of where that money is going.

2178
02:33:45,930 --> 02:33:50,812
[SPEAKER_19]: If you get $300,000 in this particular account, no indication where that money is going.

2179
02:33:51,312 --> 02:33:53,093
[SPEAKER_19]: And if the gentleman at the podium is correct,

2180
02:33:53,609 --> 02:33:59,993
[SPEAKER_19]: that you can't find somebody who's reputable to build this station, then all we've done is absolutely nothing.

2181
02:34:00,813 --> 02:34:21,345
[SPEAKER_19]: And if I understand correctly, if Comcast has the availability through the contract that the mayor does sign to take that channel away from the city, well, where is the 5% worth of revenues that the city basically would have as it relates to the contract?

2182
02:34:22,030 --> 02:34:23,410
[SPEAKER_19]: That's the agreement, it's 5%.

2183
02:34:24,811 --> 02:34:33,373
[SPEAKER_19]: 3% goes to the city, 2% goes between public access, channel 16 and channel 15, which is the educational channel.

2184
02:34:34,313 --> 02:34:36,774
[SPEAKER_19]: This has been floundering way, way, way too long.

2185
02:34:37,554 --> 02:34:42,176
[SPEAKER_19]: The mayor has just been a constant refuser to participate with this council.

2186
02:34:42,516 --> 02:34:46,797
[SPEAKER_19]: He's been a constant refuser to be transparent with this council.

2187
02:34:47,357 --> 02:34:50,218
[SPEAKER_19]: He's been a constant refuser to want to be part

2188
02:34:50,628 --> 02:34:52,129
[SPEAKER_19]: of Medford's city government.

2189
02:34:52,930 --> 02:34:55,392
[SPEAKER_19]: This is not a dictatorship, this is not an emperorship.

2190
02:34:56,372 --> 02:35:00,375
[SPEAKER_19]: This is a group of elected officials that have to answer to the people.

2191
02:35:01,196 --> 02:35:03,778
[SPEAKER_19]: Every one of us have to answer to the people, including him.

2192
02:35:04,739 --> 02:35:08,682
[SPEAKER_19]: But so far, he's got a free ride because nobody wants the job maybe anymore.

2193
02:35:08,922 --> 02:35:15,967
[SPEAKER_19]: Because maybe everybody realizes that it's decent, that the job isn't worth it because of what they're gonna have to go through.

2194
02:35:16,487 --> 02:35:19,910
[SPEAKER_19]: The guy has never woke up in the morning, ever had to open a door,

2195
02:35:20,572 --> 02:35:29,277
[SPEAKER_19]: turn the key, hire employees, pay workman's comp, pay for the electric, pay for the gas, pay for everything that makes a business have to run.

2196
02:35:30,117 --> 02:35:40,203
[SPEAKER_19]: And then, at the same time, tries to tell the taxpayers of this community what they have to pay for and how they should be taxed continuously and continuously and without a voice.

2197
02:35:40,523 --> 02:35:41,384
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not fair.

2198
02:35:41,744 --> 02:35:42,444
[SPEAKER_19]: It's not right.

2199
02:35:43,245 --> 02:35:46,346
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I don't know where we can go with this.

2200
02:35:46,406 --> 02:35:49,368
[SPEAKER_19]: The council was as clear as a bell not to go forward.

2201
02:35:49,873 --> 02:35:52,495
[SPEAKER_19]: requesting the mayor not to go forward with a 10-year contract.

2202
02:35:53,156 --> 02:35:57,519
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, if he does go forward with a 10-year contract, again, the people of this community have been snickered.

2203
02:35:59,121 --> 02:36:00,462
[SPEAKER_19]: And, you know, where do we go?

2204
02:36:00,522 --> 02:36:02,444
[SPEAKER_19]: What do we tell the ratepayers of this community?

2205
02:36:02,924 --> 02:36:04,005
[SPEAKER_19]: What do we tell the citizens?

2206
02:36:04,585 --> 02:36:05,226
[SPEAKER_19]: What are we here for?

2207
02:36:06,090 --> 02:36:08,450
[SPEAKER_19]: if we can't do anything that makes any sense.

2208
02:36:09,051 --> 02:36:14,572
[SPEAKER_19]: This doesn't mean you have to be against him on everything, but it seems to be that way because he just doesn't want to talk to us.

2209
02:36:15,272 --> 02:36:17,232
[SPEAKER_19]: He just wants to talk to the newspaper.

2210
02:36:17,512 --> 02:36:19,332
[SPEAKER_19]: You have to find things out through the newspaper.

2211
02:36:20,093 --> 02:36:26,634
[SPEAKER_19]: Like today, he had to find out through the newspaper about the dog park that supposedly now looks like it's coming out of his grand scheme of things.

2212
02:36:27,274 --> 02:36:33,375
[SPEAKER_19]: That became a genesis of people that had dogs who were so upset not being able to have a dog park in the city of Medford.

2213
02:36:33,773 --> 02:36:39,096
[SPEAKER_19]: And every time they came up with the idea, oh, no, it's going to cost too much, $200,000, $300,000, whatever it might be.

2214
02:36:39,656 --> 02:36:46,920
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, if you do some work, as Councilor Marks and the committee did, and shop around, you will see that not only you can build a decent dog park, there are monies out there.

2215
02:36:47,700 --> 02:36:48,300
[SPEAKER_19]: And so be it.

2216
02:36:49,501 --> 02:36:50,021
[SPEAKER_19]: You know something?

2217
02:36:50,902 --> 02:36:52,563
[SPEAKER_19]: We talk about this stuff each and every week.

2218
02:36:53,303 --> 02:36:59,546
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the coup d'etat's going to come when we have that meeting toward the end of the month as it relates to the kiosk.

2219
02:36:59,566 --> 02:37:03,068
[SPEAKER_19]: We'll find out what this is all about, because businesses and the folks

2220
02:37:03,591 --> 02:37:05,112
[SPEAKER_19]: They're going to start to tell you that they're hurting.

2221
02:37:05,632 --> 02:37:10,175
[SPEAKER_19]: They're going to tell you that business is off and customers are leaving because of the craziness of the kiosk.

2222
02:37:10,395 --> 02:37:18,559
[SPEAKER_19]: And you're right, Councilor Caviello, when you turned around and you said, you put the money in the kiosk, you don't know where you're supposed to go, left, right, up or down, five or six spots, whatever it might be.

2223
02:37:19,740 --> 02:37:32,087
[SPEAKER_19]: But if they think they're going to go out of their way to mock and spot off the kiosk when the streets are in deplorable condition, the crosswalks don't even exist anymore, the potholes are beyond help, then there will be a problem around here.

2224
02:37:32,788 --> 02:37:35,850
[SPEAKER_19]: And that gentleman who's here, I don't think he's gone now, he's right.

2225
02:37:36,490 --> 02:37:40,392
[SPEAKER_19]: He's right on the RFP as it's being an amendment to the contract.

2226
02:37:41,252 --> 02:37:42,273
[SPEAKER_19]: They have obligations.

2227
02:37:42,613 --> 02:37:46,175
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think it was the lady who appeared here some two or three weeks ago who made the comment.

2228
02:37:46,515 --> 02:37:48,036
[SPEAKER_19]: She made the comment as clear as a bell.

2229
02:37:48,596 --> 02:37:51,778
[SPEAKER_19]: We can sue them, or we can get out of the contract, but there is an offset.

2230
02:37:51,798 --> 02:37:52,998
[SPEAKER_19]: And there are offsets to that.

2231
02:37:53,359 --> 02:38:00,342
[SPEAKER_19]: And the offsets to that whole contract are the failures and the intentional neglect and the results

2232
02:38:02,362 --> 02:38:08,367
[SPEAKER_19]: I call them the bounty hunters from Tennessee, them taking our money, running around and not adhering to the law.

2233
02:38:08,467 --> 02:38:10,288
[SPEAKER_19]: They can't even get their cars straight.

2234
02:38:10,549 --> 02:38:12,330
[SPEAKER_19]: They can't even get the details straight.

2235
02:38:13,271 --> 02:38:14,512
[SPEAKER_19]: And the police should be all over them.

2236
02:38:14,712 --> 02:38:18,215
[SPEAKER_19]: They should be out there towing their cars because they're supposed to be mocked.

2237
02:38:18,235 --> 02:38:22,578
[SPEAKER_19]: This week they're mocked on the ring road over there in a spot that they're not supposed to be.

2238
02:38:23,079 --> 02:38:24,320
[SPEAKER_19]: They've been in front of hydrants.

2239
02:38:25,340 --> 02:38:27,042
[SPEAKER_19]: They've been in front of handicapped spots.

2240
02:38:29,515 --> 02:38:30,776
[SPEAKER_19]: Mr. President, I don't know where we're going.

2241
02:38:30,916 --> 02:38:33,638
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, this is frustration talking here right now, as you can tell.

2242
02:38:33,979 --> 02:38:35,120
[SPEAKER_19]: You got a new haircut, I can tell.

2243
02:38:35,380 --> 02:38:36,421
[SPEAKER_19]: But that's beside the point.

2244
02:38:36,801 --> 02:38:40,384
[SPEAKER_19]: The fact of the matter is... Thank you, and thank you to John DeVito.

2245
02:38:41,185 --> 02:38:42,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Counselor Camuso.

2246
02:38:43,567 --> 02:38:43,907
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2247
02:38:44,948 --> 02:38:50,973
[SPEAKER_05]: On the TV public access, people have referred this evening that there was one bid.

2248
02:38:51,333 --> 02:38:54,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we know who it is and who the board of directors are and stuff?

2249
02:38:54,676 --> 02:38:56,718
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we're going to ask the question, but does anyone have any idea?

2250
02:38:58,820 --> 02:39:01,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Winchester decided not to, all the local ones decided not to put in, right?

2251
02:39:01,962 --> 02:39:03,684
[SPEAKER_04]: All the local ones decided not to put in, okay.

2252
02:39:03,704 --> 02:39:09,749
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am that person, Mr. Camuso.

2253
02:39:09,769 --> 02:39:13,812
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the one who submitted a proposal because no one else would.

2254
02:39:14,032 --> 02:39:24,000
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm fighting this good fight and I'll do respect Jeannie, but after 40 years of this and all my connections in AXS TV, I can put together a great team instantly.

2255
02:39:24,400 --> 02:39:27,743
[SPEAKER_04]: All we need is the mayor to, and I think, I think it was Councilor Caravaglia, right?

2256
02:39:28,480 --> 02:39:29,301
[SPEAKER_04]: This is craziness.

2257
02:39:29,561 --> 02:39:31,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just reactivate MCC TV3.

2258
02:39:32,142 --> 02:39:33,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Give us the new nonprofit.

2259
02:39:33,303 --> 02:39:34,424
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to stay in forever.

2260
02:39:34,784 --> 02:39:36,765
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to do the Frank Polari thing of 28 years.

2261
02:39:37,166 --> 02:39:45,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to go and guide the ship and help get it started, because I got other things that I'm doing that I just want to get it up and started.

2262
02:39:45,191 --> 02:39:48,733
[SPEAKER_04]: But what I wanted to say, too, is this is happy anniversary, Mayor McGlynn.

2263
02:39:49,233 --> 02:39:51,755
[SPEAKER_04]: It was two years ago tonight and tomorrow that the color bars went up.

2264
02:39:52,306 --> 02:39:55,008
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a very important night here.

2265
02:39:55,869 --> 02:39:57,530
[SPEAKER_04]: Color bars, well, you're taking our money.

2266
02:39:58,050 --> 02:40:06,036
[SPEAKER_04]: You could have had Chris Donovan and I go to the head end and bring compact disc players and DVD players and broadcast sports and stuff.

2267
02:40:06,056 --> 02:40:06,956
[SPEAKER_04]: We would have done that for you.

2268
02:40:07,316 --> 02:40:09,858
[SPEAKER_04]: The proposals on your desk, Mark Rumley told me he gave it to you.

2269
02:40:10,279 --> 02:40:11,179
[SPEAKER_04]: We would have done that for you.

2270
02:40:11,459 --> 02:40:12,480
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have access.

2271
02:40:12,760 --> 02:40:14,201
[SPEAKER_04]: We could have used the high school channel.

2272
02:40:14,481 --> 02:40:15,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a lot of sports.

2273
02:40:15,342 --> 02:40:17,423
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a lot of Pat Fiorello shows we could air.

2274
02:40:17,944 --> 02:40:19,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Lots of good stuff, Your Honor.

2275
02:40:20,123 --> 02:40:35,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Two years ago tonight, it was December 17th, the last Ziggy Bush show aired, December 17th, 2012, and April Fool's Day 2013, happy April Fool's Day, your public access channel went off the air and it hasn't come back tonight.

2276
02:40:36,066 --> 02:40:36,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Two years.

2277
02:40:36,646 --> 02:40:38,606
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question for the gentleman that submitted a bid.

2278
02:40:39,846 --> 02:40:40,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir.

2279
02:40:42,587 --> 02:40:49,148
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you feel that if you're in charge of that access TV that the people would be coming out of the rafters to participate, Medford residents?

2280
02:40:49,418 --> 02:40:51,660
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sir, I do, because I have a program to do outreach.

2281
02:40:51,700 --> 02:40:53,241
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very good at outreach.

2282
02:40:53,562 --> 02:40:58,005
[SPEAKER_05]: But you were involved with a lot of the past TV3 stuff that was going on.

2283
02:40:58,286 --> 02:41:04,111
[SPEAKER_04]: I helped shut them down, and I'm proud of it, because it was—in fact, you benefited from TV3, sir.

2284
02:41:04,131 --> 02:41:07,133
[SPEAKER_04]: You benefited from a board member putting you on the air when he wasn't supposed to.

2285
02:41:07,614 --> 02:41:11,277
[SPEAKER_04]: So while your colleagues were being bashed, you never once defended them.

2286
02:41:11,737 --> 02:41:12,438
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't allow that.

2287
02:41:13,018 --> 02:41:15,160
[SPEAKER_04]: I will adhere to the rules, and I will be very transparent.

2288
02:41:15,797 --> 02:41:18,578
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to open it up and guide the ship and set the laws down.

2289
02:41:18,638 --> 02:41:20,219
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I want to walk away and do my show.

2290
02:41:20,239 --> 02:41:20,919
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you have to?

2291
02:41:20,939 --> 02:41:22,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I thought you can't do the show if you're a nonprofit.

2292
02:41:24,280 --> 02:41:25,940
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what the mayor's new thing is.

2293
02:41:25,960 --> 02:41:26,641
[SPEAKER_05]: That came up.

2294
02:41:26,741 --> 02:41:27,781
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you said it last week.

2295
02:41:28,861 --> 02:41:34,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody has said it last week that if you're the new board or the new nonprofit will not be able to produce their own shows.

2296
02:41:34,543 --> 02:41:41,646
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what Mayor McGlynn and Mark Rumley have put together for their proposal, which is why it scared everyone away, because you have to have people guiding the ship.

2297
02:41:41,986 --> 02:41:45,407
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to have people explaining, doing, showing how to do it.

2298
02:41:46,352 --> 02:41:50,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Unlike the previous regime, I don't run over to the senior center and put myself on TV.

2299
02:41:50,074 --> 02:41:52,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I usually get behind the camera and help the public.

2300
02:41:53,737 --> 02:41:54,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I've put Jeanne Martin on the air.

2301
02:41:54,977 --> 02:41:55,738
[SPEAKER_04]: I've put State Rep.

2302
02:41:55,758 --> 02:41:56,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul Donato on the air.

2303
02:41:56,698 --> 02:41:58,139
[SPEAKER_04]: I've put Paul Camuso on the air.

2304
02:41:58,179 --> 02:41:59,300
[SPEAKER_04]: I've put Bob Penter on the air.

2305
02:41:59,940 --> 02:42:02,162
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had Mayor Menino on the air.

2306
02:42:02,642 --> 02:42:05,003
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't need to be on TV.

2307
02:42:05,664 --> 02:42:07,985
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to not be at the council every week.

2308
02:42:08,265 --> 02:42:10,587
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to be behind the scenes at AXS TV.

2309
02:42:11,779 --> 02:42:13,079
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been doing it for 40 years, Paul.

2310
02:42:13,099 --> 02:42:14,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't need to be on the TV every week.

2311
02:42:16,000 --> 02:42:19,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Our community needs it, and I'm just here putting myself on the line.

2312
02:42:19,241 --> 02:42:23,323
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can pick me apart, you can throw rocks at me, but I'm trying to help my community.

2313
02:42:23,923 --> 02:42:25,744
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm asking legitimate questions, Joe.

2314
02:42:25,784 --> 02:42:27,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I can put a board together.

2315
02:42:27,684 --> 02:42:29,685
[SPEAKER_04]: I can put a board of directors together quickly.

2316
02:42:30,245 --> 02:42:34,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have the financial backing to get your nonprofit off the ground?

2317
02:42:34,767 --> 02:42:36,047
[SPEAKER_04]: I would go to businesses.

2318
02:42:36,427 --> 02:42:37,448
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do this, Paul.

2319
02:42:37,488 --> 02:42:38,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I can put it together.

2320
02:42:39,038 --> 02:42:39,739
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a non-profit.

2321
02:42:39,799 --> 02:42:42,161
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't accept money from businesses to... Wait a minute.

2322
02:42:42,541 --> 02:42:45,524
[SPEAKER_05]: You just said you're going to go to businesses to get the money to get your non-profit off the ground.

2323
02:42:45,544 --> 02:42:46,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what you said?

2324
02:42:46,305 --> 02:42:46,885
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.

2325
02:42:46,925 --> 02:42:51,890
[SPEAKER_04]: Our non-profit can be sponsored by businesses as TV3 was sponsored by businesses.

2326
02:42:52,451 --> 02:42:53,111
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very simple.

2327
02:42:53,151 --> 02:42:55,393
[SPEAKER_05]: So do you have the financial backing to get it off the ground?

2328
02:42:55,413 --> 02:42:56,314
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I'm asking.

2329
02:42:56,354 --> 02:42:57,355
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I do.

2330
02:42:57,375 --> 02:42:57,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2331
02:42:57,796 --> 02:43:00,198
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, if you received a bid,

2332
02:43:00,683 --> 02:43:01,764
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd be able to get it up and running?

2333
02:43:01,924 --> 02:43:03,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd put it up and running tomorrow.

2334
02:43:03,365 --> 02:43:04,325
[SPEAKER_04]: I've said this for years.

2335
02:43:04,365 --> 02:43:04,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Construction.

2336
02:43:04,946 --> 02:43:05,846
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do the construction.

2337
02:43:05,866 --> 02:43:06,327
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do everything.

2338
02:43:06,347 --> 02:43:07,528
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to do the construction.

2339
02:43:07,568 --> 02:43:09,329
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think the $300,000 is for?

2340
02:43:09,529 --> 02:43:10,910
[SPEAKER_04]: You think I'm going to pay for the construction?

2341
02:43:10,930 --> 02:43:12,271
[SPEAKER_04]: The construction's a whole separate bid.

2342
02:43:12,291 --> 02:43:13,151
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the city councilor.

2343
02:43:13,472 --> 02:43:14,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Why am I teaching you?

2344
02:43:15,413 --> 02:43:18,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Why am I teaching you that the Comcast contract is in?

2345
02:43:18,375 --> 02:43:19,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Why am I teaching you about the construction?

2346
02:43:20,016 --> 02:43:21,257
[SPEAKER_04]: That may have been paced for that.

2347
02:43:21,297 --> 02:43:22,898
[SPEAKER_05]: First of all, I'm asking legitimate questions.

2348
02:43:22,938 --> 02:43:24,319
[SPEAKER_05]: And because you don't like the questions.

2349
02:43:24,339 --> 02:43:25,940
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be prepared as a city councilor.

2350
02:43:25,960 --> 02:43:27,321
[SPEAKER_14]: You should know.

2351
02:43:27,401 --> 02:43:29,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's wrap this up.

2352
02:43:29,470 --> 02:43:33,132
[SPEAKER_04]: You should know as a city council that the mayor is paying for the infrastructure.

2353
02:43:33,312 --> 02:43:34,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely, it's a separate bid that went out.

2354
02:43:35,153 --> 02:43:38,555
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, I don't have to pay to get access to AV to put the equipment in.

2355
02:43:38,695 --> 02:43:39,676
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not coming out of my pocket.

2356
02:43:39,736 --> 02:43:43,358
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you need someone that knows how to design it and everything else to make it happen.

2357
02:43:43,378 --> 02:43:44,399
[SPEAKER_04]: I have all those people, Paul.

2358
02:43:44,739 --> 02:43:45,699
[SPEAKER_05]: I know how this works.

2359
02:43:45,719 --> 02:43:51,103
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, they're here every week with you, so I'm just sort of questioning the backing that you have as far as getting the job done.

2360
02:43:52,172 --> 02:43:53,473
[SPEAKER_05]: The job will be done instantly.

2361
02:43:53,653 --> 02:43:57,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, and the mayor doesn't, like I said, I have a motion and here's the other thing too.

2362
02:43:57,436 --> 02:43:58,597
[SPEAKER_05]: Happy anniversary color bar.

2363
02:43:58,617 --> 02:43:58,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2364
02:43:59,237 --> 02:43:59,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate that.

2365
02:44:00,478 --> 02:44:05,622
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the other thing, Mr. President, we're still waiting for our report back from the solicitor.

2366
02:44:05,662 --> 02:44:11,606
[SPEAKER_05]: If the funds can be used for upgrading technology in the community in lieu of the public access.

2367
02:44:12,047 --> 02:44:19,032
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we could maybe ask the city solicitor for an update on that, because, um, as amended by council, so all those in favor,

2368
02:44:20,028 --> 02:44:21,929
[SPEAKER_14]: On that motion, Councilor Pinto.

2369
02:44:22,030 --> 02:44:29,635
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't think you can, because the way this new contract is written or being amended, if it's not used for public access, then they have the right to take the channel back.

2370
02:44:29,655 --> 02:44:31,216
[SPEAKER_19]: It cannot be used.

2371
02:44:31,977 --> 02:44:35,159
[SPEAKER_19]: It's only to be used one of two ways, public access, or they take it back.

2372
02:44:35,199 --> 02:44:38,401
[SPEAKER_05]: But it also can be used for the education channel and the government channel, doesn't it?

2373
02:44:38,421 --> 02:44:39,802
[SPEAKER_19]: No, public access is PEG.

2374
02:44:40,042 --> 02:44:42,244
[SPEAKER_19]: It's public access, educational, and government.

2375
02:44:42,264 --> 02:44:48,268
[SPEAKER_05]: But we could do, if the city administration decided to, he could do EGG, get rid of the P and do EGG, educational and government.

2376
02:44:49,793 --> 02:44:51,194
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to read the contract the way it's written.

2377
02:44:51,474 --> 02:44:52,895
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm fully aware of the contract.

2378
02:44:53,335 --> 02:44:54,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Instead of peg, he could do egg.

2379
02:44:54,976 --> 02:44:56,857
[SPEAKER_05]: Educational in government, if we want it done.

2380
02:44:57,137 --> 02:44:59,539
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a motion on the floor by Councilor Camuso.

2381
02:44:59,779 --> 02:45:02,781
[SPEAKER_14]: Ma'am, we could just do briefly.

2382
02:45:05,022 --> 02:45:05,422
[SPEAKER_14]: Briefly.

2383
02:45:06,123 --> 02:45:06,523
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

2384
02:45:06,863 --> 02:45:07,964
[SPEAKER_01]: Gene Martington coming straight.

2385
02:45:07,984 --> 02:45:11,686
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to say, um, well, I disagree with Joe.

2386
02:45:12,434 --> 02:45:13,775
[SPEAKER_01]: on who should run the new station.

2387
02:45:14,116 --> 02:45:15,537
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give my props to Joe.

2388
02:45:15,737 --> 02:45:22,763
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that without Joe's efforts, we would still be dealing with that group of people that was a bunch of delinquents.

2389
02:45:23,204 --> 02:45:25,526
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just want to give my props to Joe for that.

2390
02:45:25,966 --> 02:45:30,690
[SPEAKER_01]: If it wasn't for him educating me on access TV, I wouldn't know any of that stuff.

2391
02:45:31,050 --> 02:45:32,331
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to thank him for that.

2392
02:45:32,512 --> 02:45:33,633
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give him his props for that.

2393
02:45:34,785 --> 02:45:35,165
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2394
02:45:36,285 --> 02:45:36,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

2395
02:45:37,125 --> 02:45:37,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

2396
02:45:37,605 --> 02:45:42,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, anyway, but anyway, um, I hope that, uh, we get a new station because the city deserves it.

2397
02:45:42,726 --> 02:45:43,046
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

2398
02:45:43,246 --> 02:45:43,587
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

2399
02:45:43,627 --> 02:45:47,687
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of, uh, Councilor Camuso as amended Councilor Knight.

2400
02:45:47,887 --> 02:45:50,148
[SPEAKER_14]: Will the clerk please read back the language of the resolution?

2401
02:45:52,608 --> 02:46:03,250
[SPEAKER_14]: The resolution asked by Councilor Camuso that, uh, uh, the purchasing, uh, agent, uh, update the council on who has made the bid for the contract.

2402
02:46:05,443 --> 02:46:08,304
[SPEAKER_14]: if there was a qualified responsive bid.

2403
02:46:09,025 --> 02:46:13,807
[SPEAKER_05]: And secondly, qualified and responsive bidders.

2404
02:46:14,487 --> 02:46:17,129
[SPEAKER_14]: Qualified and responsive bidders.

2405
02:46:17,449 --> 02:46:25,673
[SPEAKER_14]: And the other one is the update from the solicitor on the status of the money, the PEG monies.

2406
02:46:26,673 --> 02:46:28,914
[SPEAKER_14]: The status of the PEG monies from the city solicitor.

2407
02:46:29,274 --> 02:46:30,115
[SPEAKER_14]: Move the question, Mr. President.

2408
02:46:30,755 --> 02:46:32,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to move the questions.

2409
02:46:32,336 --> 02:46:33,136
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

2410
02:46:33,156 --> 02:46:33,216
[SPEAKER_14]: Aye.

2411
02:46:33,917 --> 02:46:34,677
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

2412
02:46:38,188 --> 02:46:44,951
[SPEAKER_14]: The records of the March 24, 2015 meeting were passed to the Honorable Counselor Camuso.

2413
02:46:45,431 --> 02:46:47,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Counselor, how did you find those records?

2414
02:46:47,612 --> 02:46:49,213
[SPEAKER_14]: I found them in order and I move approval.

2415
02:46:49,933 --> 02:46:53,094
[SPEAKER_14]: On a motion for approval, the records by Counselor Camuso.

2416
02:46:53,114 --> 02:46:53,854
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

2417
02:46:53,874 --> 02:46:54,595
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

2418
02:46:55,015 --> 02:46:55,955
[SPEAKER_14]: Motion passes.

[SPEAKER_14]: Motion to adjourn by Counselor Knight.

02:46:58,997 --> 02:46:59,757
[SPEAKER_14]: All those in favor?

2421
02:47:00,117 --> 02:47:00,957
[SPEAKER_14]: All those opposed?

2422
02:47:01,037 --> 02:47:01,698
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm opposed.

2423
02:47:01,718 --> 02:47:02,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Meeting adjourned.
