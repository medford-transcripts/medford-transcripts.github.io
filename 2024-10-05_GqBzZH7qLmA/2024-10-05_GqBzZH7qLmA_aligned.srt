42
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:55,211
on the motion of Councillor Knight to waive the reading in lieu of a brief synopsis provided by Vice-Chairman Behrs, seconded by- Second.

43
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:56,533
Vice-Chairman Behrs.

44
00:01:56,593 --> 00:01:57,574
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

45
00:02:00,877 --> 00:02:01,738
Vice-Chairman Behrs.

46
00:02:01,938 --> 00:02:02,218

00:02:03,059 --> 00:02:03,280
Yes.

49
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,761
Councillor Collins.

50
00:02:05,122 --> 00:02:05,342
Yes.

51
00:02:06,743 --> 00:02:07,484
Councillor Knight.

52
00:02:07,524 --> 00:02:07,804
Yes.

53
00:02:07,844 --> 00:02:08,425
Councillor Stroud.

54
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:08,905
Yes.

55
00:02:09,026 --> 00:02:09,606
Councillor Sagan.

56
00:02:09,927 --> 00:02:10,127
Yes.

57
00:02:11,893 --> 00:02:14,156
Yes, I'm in the affirmative, so your motion passes.

58
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:19,284
I will go to Vice President Behrs for a brief synopsis of the paper before us for this public hearing.

59
00:02:19,304 --> 00:02:20,205
Vice President Behrs.

60
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,267
Thank you, Madam President.

61
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:25,673
I believe this is the sixth public meeting we've now had on these items.

62
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:36,498
These are three amendments proposed to the city charter that with the approval of the council and the approval of the mayor would be submitted to the voters in November for their approval.

63
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:48,203
This first amendment would provide the city council with the authority to employ staff for research and legal consulting as needed.

64
00:02:49,764 --> 00:02:51,565
The second one would

65
00:02:52,263 --> 00:03:02,252
create a better budget plan and better budget process for the city of Medford by setting a formal date by which the mayor would be required to submit the annual budget.

66
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:19,443
The City Council would also have a formal date by which it would have to approve or otherwise act on the mayor's budget proposal, and it would also allow the City Council to have a real role in the budget process by reallocating funds between line items.

67
00:03:19,523 --> 00:03:25,406
Right now, the City Council can only approve a whole budget, reject a whole budget, or cut specific line items.

68
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:28,448
This would make the City Council a partner in the budget process.

69
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,259
But the city council could not increase the budget above the mayor's proposal.

70
00:03:34,642 --> 00:03:38,050
So those are the three amendments of the third amendment sorry the third amendment would.

71
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:48,557
make appointees of the mayor to municipal boards, committees, and commissions created by city ordinance or by state law, subject to confirmation of the council.

72
00:03:48,577 --> 00:03:59,943
Right now, the city council does not confirm any nominees to the boards, committees, and commissions that are created by ordinance or state law, unless otherwise required by the ordinance or by state law.

73
00:04:00,563 --> 00:04:01,304
So those are the three.

74
00:04:01,744 --> 00:04:03,164
I won't do the summary on the next two.

75
00:04:04,905 --> 00:04:06,086
Save us some time on that.

76
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:06,786
Thank you.

77
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:12,487
And I know there were some questions the last time for any amendments from legal counsel.

78
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:16,348
Are those included in what is on the agenda or is that something you need to make on the floor?

79
00:04:16,408 --> 00:04:23,550
Yes, the language reflects the motion from our May 9th meeting to incorporate the specific language changes from legal counsel.

80
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:34,892
And those were also, those changes are also in our packets this past weekend as a red line copy and were also sent out to counselors about a month ago when they came in from Attorney Goldberg.

81
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:40,551
So as this is a public hearing, I will take each, I will go to, sorry, we'll go to Councilor Collins.

82
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:42,172
Councilor Collins.

83
00:04:43,553 --> 00:04:44,353
Apologies, President Brown.

84
00:04:44,394 --> 00:04:45,775
I'm happy for you to open the meeting first.

85
00:04:49,157 --> 00:04:49,477
Thank you.

86
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,340
So as this is a public hearing, I'll take these papers one by one.

87
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,201
So we have paper 23-097.

88
00:04:55,221 --> 00:04:58,864
So this is the appointments by city council.

89
00:05:00,797 --> 00:05:06,079
enable the city council with many stipulations to secure legal services either by employment or on a contractual basis.

90
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:12,981
Such legal services shall be solely in the service of the council and make good research analysis drafting drafting assistance.

91
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:20,503
Was it anyone who would like me to read the full proposed amendments?

92
00:05:20,523 --> 00:05:26,565
Okay, so we'll open this portion of the public hearing if there is anyone who would like to speak in favor

93
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:31,335
of paper 23-097, either on Zoom or in person.

94
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:37,497
Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

95
00:05:38,198 --> 00:05:44,760
Is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of paper 23-097, either in person or on Zoom?

96
00:05:48,622 --> 00:05:51,903
Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

97
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:56,285
Any further discussion from the council or do I have a motion?

98
00:05:58,597 --> 00:05:59,299
Motion to approve.

99
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,854
I'll start going to Councilor Sang.

100
00:06:06,194 --> 00:06:20,504
I'll be brief because we've held meetings on this, and I wanted to reiterate that we've done our very best to engage the public in a rigorous process with this.

101
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:25,127
And I believe that to members of the public, the item at hand is pretty clear.

102
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:32,472
I especially get that sense from emails that I've gotten from constituents,

103
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:39,235
We've asked for feedback with gauge support, and we've gotten a lot of feedback in support.

104
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:46,418
Because this is an important vote, I wanted to quickly reiterate why I support this.

105
00:06:46,998 --> 00:06:50,419
First, I think it allows for a framework of cooperation.

106
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:58,382
And as the mayor said in our Tuesday meeting last week, that's a goal that we, that's something that we want to aspire to.

107
00:06:59,282 --> 00:07:00,023
from both sides.

108
00:07:00,984 --> 00:07:03,186
And it allows for that framework through good times and bad.

109
00:07:03,846 --> 00:07:06,389
Councillor Berry said something that stuck with me.

110
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:12,314
He said something along the lines of, we want to be writing the press releases with you guys, with the mayor.

111
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:20,782
And I just do believe that there's so much stronger of a message of political movement when we all work together.

112
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:25,044
and compromise and work together to get to a place where we like on the issues.

113
00:07:25,865 --> 00:07:27,426
But it's not just about the positives.

114
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:48,958
I believe that these amendments allow us to shoulder the burden of governance together, to make difficult choices together, and to do so in a more public, transparent format where we can explain the choices that we make to our residents as well, which I think is gonna be important in the years coming up, especially with the fiscal cliff that we've all been talking about.

115
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:55,045
What these amendments offer isn't that much different from what happens in other cities and other levels of government.

116
00:07:55,305 --> 00:07:56,687
People expect us to work together.

117
00:07:56,907 --> 00:08:01,212
They expect the legislative branch to have a role in these things.

118
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:06,459
And people are actually just confused why we don't do these things the way that we're proposing already.

119
00:08:09,802 --> 00:08:13,323
I see that in the survey results for the budget survey that I put out.

120
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:16,723
I believe that these amendments allow us to do our job.

121
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:19,304
Residents expect legislators to legislate.

122
00:08:19,744 --> 00:08:23,424
It's the central mission of our job and it's in the name.

123
00:08:23,524 --> 00:08:34,406
To all the residents who wonder why we don't move faster on issues, I believe while a lot of it is a need for process, a lot of it is also the lack of staff and researchers that we have.

124
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:37,067
These amendments allow us to

125
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,669
make it help us to help you.

126
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:41,951
They help us to do our job.

127
00:08:42,532 --> 00:08:45,154
I think that these amendments I'm going to close off here.

128
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:52,842
But by saying that, I think these amendments allow us to plan and longer term and increase transparency, it moves up the calendar.

129
00:08:54,684 --> 00:09:01,768
and I know that this is a stated goal of everyone on the city council and the mayor said that as well.

130
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:06,431
I think a prime example is in soliciting feedback from residents this time.

131
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:08,592
I think I have really

132
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:15,039
I think we've all talked about after school child care before on the council, but it is something that we need to tackle as a city.

133
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:27,412
And if we were able to engage residents at an earlier time, and we had more of a public facing process where the legislative could help the executive do that too, we would be able to

134
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:30,794
find a way to address it or start to address it in the budget.

135
00:09:31,214 --> 00:09:36,057
And so I think, you know, there are literally litany of reasons why I think everyone should support these amendments.

136
00:09:36,277 --> 00:09:44,823
But I think Councillor Bares for all the work that he's put into this, I think the rest of the council for being so patient and for for entertaining these ideas.

137
00:09:46,664 --> 00:09:47,925
Thank you, Councillor Collins.

138
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:51,678
Thank you, President Morrell.

139
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,703
I'm excited that we've gotten to the point tonight where we get to vote on these.

140
00:09:56,723 --> 00:10:08,174
I thank Vice President Behrs for noting that this is the sixth time that we've been able to meet and discuss these in public meetings so far this year and have the floor open for public comment and questions.

141
00:10:08,934 --> 00:10:15,160
But at the same time, you know, I want to reinforce for folks who are watching this meeting that this is the beginning of a process, not the end.

142
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:23,987
You know, should these pass, this would be no different from putting, for example, a debt exclusion on the ballot or putting a CPA amendment on the ballot, as was done several years ago.

143
00:10:24,668 --> 00:10:30,613
This leads it up to the voters to continue to discuss and consider and then place individual

144
00:10:31,313 --> 00:10:33,115
votes on these individual amendments.

145
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:41,222
I've said this before, but just to reiterate, you know, I think that these amendments would be additive for this whole community.

146
00:10:41,522 --> 00:10:51,610
Administrations change, but we always deserve a council that is truly empowered to represent our community members and act on their behalf, not just be a grandstanding body, not just be a rubber stamp.

147
00:10:53,451 --> 00:11:00,454
Right now, this council can't appropriate resources to ensure that the policies we do pass actually get enforced or if they are just left to gather dust.

148
00:11:01,114 --> 00:11:06,356
We can't hire staff to allow us to do our work confidently or effectively or with the resources that we need.

149
00:11:06,937 --> 00:11:12,419
We're not empowered to really collaborate with the administration to craft budgets that reflect what we hear from our constituents.

150
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:17,661
So to me, these are important because these amendments would leave the community with seven more avenues.

151
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:21,845
for meaningful representation in their city government, and that's really what it comes down to.

152
00:11:22,806 --> 00:11:27,370
The community's representatives should be able to actually materially represent them.

153
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:29,192
So this is about

154
00:11:30,413 --> 00:11:37,258
you know, just making some important targeted tweaks to our 40-year-old charter so that we can start working for a better community now.

155
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:46,064
Because I think that the work we have to do, the work that we've been trying to do, will be done better and faster with these amendments with a more balanced and collaborative government.

156
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:52,028
And I don't think that that can wait, you know, half a decade or more to be able to work more effectively for the constituents.

157
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:52,509
Thank you.

158
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:55,250
Thank you, Councilor Collins.

159
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,952
Any further discussion from the Council?

160
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:06,805
And just to reiterate, just so people, as Councilor Collins said, to make clear on the process, an affirmative vote from the council would result in this going to the mayor's desk.

161
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:08,866
It would then have to be approved by the mayor.

162
00:12:08,886 --> 00:12:15,369
It would be then vetted by the attorney general to then appear on the November ballot to be voted on by the voters.

163
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,850
So that's the process.

164
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,792
So this is, as Councilor Collins says, this is a step in the process.

165
00:12:19,812 --> 00:12:22,593
And if this is voted in the affirmative, nothing would change tonight.

166
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:27,556
It just moves it on to the mayor's desk, then to the AG if she votes affirmative, and then to the voters.

167
00:12:28,292 --> 00:12:31,394
So we have a motion from vicers and pairs to approve 23-097.

168
00:12:31,414 --> 00:12:40,920
And again, this is appointments by the city council with regards to securing legal services either by employment or on a contractual basis.

169
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,501
Do I have a second?

170
00:12:43,642 --> 00:12:44,662
Second.

171
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:46,523
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

172
00:12:48,485 --> 00:12:51,246
And do you want to wait the public comment period?

173
00:12:52,527 --> 00:12:52,687
Yes.

174
00:12:52,727 --> 00:12:52,927
Okay.

175
00:12:55,727 --> 00:12:59,709
Madam President, I'd advise against it on a matter that's as significant as enough as our charter.

176
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:01,850
Advise against?

177
00:13:02,271 --> 00:13:03,291
Waving the comment.

178
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:05,633
Okay, we'll keep the, okay.

179
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:09,435
So motion to approve pending the six-day public comment period.

180
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,821
Vice President Behrs.

181
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:20,761
Yes.

182
00:13:21,682 --> 00:13:22,222
Councilor Kerrio.

183
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:22,462
Yes.

184
00:13:22,482 --> 00:13:23,863
Councilor Collins.

185
00:13:26,808 --> 00:13:33,191
Yes, no, I mean, no, no, no, no.

186
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:33,671
Yes.

187
00:13:35,952 --> 00:13:36,192
Yes.

188
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:41,714
Yes, six in the affirmative one in the negative emotion passes.

189
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,715
Going to 23 dash 098.

190
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:50,913
notice of a public hearing.

191
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:58,397
The Medford City Council will hold a continued public hearing on the motion of Vice President Behrs to waive the reading.

192
00:13:59,678 --> 00:14:02,459
As we've already gotten a brief summary, so we'll waive the reading.

193
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:15,906
I will say that this paper is about the creation and approval of the municipal budget, and generally the mayor and city council of the city of Medford shall each have a role in the budget process, including the power to modify in whole or in part an appropriation order

194
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:26,580
or an item within the total amount of any appropriation order, clarify budgetary procedures, and take such other actions as are necessary to amend, approve, or disapprove the annual budget for the city.

195
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:35,003
Notwithstanding the first sentence of this section, however, the mayor shall have inclusive authority to originate an appropriation order, and it goes on for four more paragraphs.

196
00:14:35,623 --> 00:14:38,484
So I will open up the public hearing.

197
00:14:39,024 --> 00:14:45,447
Is there anyone who would like to speak in favor of 23-098, creation and approval of a municipal budget?

198
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:47,936
either on Zoom or in person.

199
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,659
Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

200
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:59,563
Is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of the paper before us, either on Zoom or in person?

201
00:15:01,604 --> 00:15:04,546
Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

202
00:15:05,714 --> 00:15:06,414
Vice President Behrs.

203
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:07,355
Thank you, Madam President.

204
00:15:07,475 --> 00:15:16,498
I'd just like to note that I've received at least 30 emails in the last three days supporting this paper among other budget requests, and I would move to approve.

205
00:15:16,518 --> 00:15:21,499
So we have a motion from Vice President Behrs.

206
00:15:23,727 --> 00:15:27,128
to approve pending the six-day power period, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

207
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:37,731
And again, this paper would follow the exact same process I outlined before, an approval by the council, sent to the mayor's desk, it would have to be vetted by the AG if she approves it, and then to the voters in November.

208
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:42,552
So on the motion of vices and fairs, as seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

209
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,135
Vice President Ferris.

210
00:15:53,195 --> 00:15:53,496
Yes.

211
00:15:55,617 --> 00:15:56,237
Councilor Kerrio.

212
00:15:56,277 --> 00:15:56,517
Yes.

213
00:15:56,997 --> 00:15:57,618
Councilor Collins.

214
00:15:58,678 --> 00:15:58,918
Yes.

215
00:15:59,779 --> 00:16:00,940
Councilor Knight.

216
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,020
Yes.

217
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,141
Councilor Scopelli.

218
00:16:03,281 --> 00:16:03,561
Yes.

219
00:16:04,381 --> 00:16:04,942
Councilor Sands.

220
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:05,702
Yes.

221
00:16:07,123 --> 00:16:07,643
President Morocco.

222
00:16:07,923 --> 00:16:08,143
Yes.

223
00:16:08,764 --> 00:16:11,205
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes.

224
00:16:11,225 --> 00:16:11,245
23-099.

225
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:16,558
Notice of a public hearing.

226
00:16:17,078 --> 00:16:26,586
The Medford City Council will hold a continued public hearing in the Howard F. Alden Chambers at Medford City Hall, 85 George B. Hassett Drive, Medford, and via Zoom on Tuesday, June 6th, 2023 at 7 p.m.

227
00:16:26,646 --> 00:16:33,212
A link will be posted no later than Friday, June 2nd, 2023, on a proposal from Councilor Isaac B. Zach Behrs.

228
00:16:33,412 --> 00:16:34,353
Motion to waive the reading.

229
00:16:34,633 --> 00:16:39,097
On the motion of Vice Mayor Behrs to waive the reading, seconded by Councilor Knight.

230
00:16:39,137 --> 00:16:40,058
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

231
00:16:49,273 --> 00:16:49,513
Yes.

232
00:16:49,573 --> 00:16:49,874
Yes.

233
00:16:49,914 --> 00:16:50,154
Yes.

234
00:17:02,458 --> 00:17:05,181
Yes, the full reading is waived.

235
00:17:05,281 --> 00:17:09,025
I will read that the paper before us to three dash 099.

236
00:17:09,426 --> 00:17:19,037
Generally, the mayor shall appoint subject to confirmation by the city council by majority vote on members of municipal boards, committees and commissions except the school committee officials appointed by the governor

237
00:17:19,517 --> 00:17:26,618
and assessors, if elected by a vote of the people, for whom no other method of appointment or selection is provided by city ordinance or general laws.

238
00:17:27,158 --> 00:17:31,799
All members of municipal boards, committees, and commissions shall serve terms as defined by city ordinance and general laws.

239
00:17:31,939 --> 00:17:35,340
All heads of departments shall be appointed by the mayor without confirmation of city council.

240
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,680
And that continues on.

241
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,260
I will continue the public hearing.

242
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:45,101
Is there anyone who would like to speak in favor of Q3-099 appointments by the mayor?

243
00:17:46,142 --> 00:17:47,062
Either in person or on Zoom.

244
00:17:50,374 --> 00:17:52,776
Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

245
00:17:53,136 --> 00:17:56,659
Is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of paper 23-099?

246
00:17:59,981 --> 00:18:02,903
Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

247
00:18:03,724 --> 00:18:05,065
Any further discussion from the council?

248
00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:09,047
Do I have a motion?

249
00:18:09,628 --> 00:18:12,250
Motion to approve pending the comment period.

250
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:18,854
On the motion of vicers and bearers to approve paper 23-099 pending the six-day public comment period.

251
00:18:20,956 --> 00:18:21,256
Second.

252
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:23,177
Councilor Collins.

253
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:30,339
And again, just to reiterate one last time, this approval by the council would set this to the mayor's desk.

254
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:36,461
If the mayor were to approve it, it would have to go to the attorney general and then appear before the voters in November.

255
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:40,442
So on the motion of Vice President Behrs as seconded by Councilor Collins.

256
00:18:40,622 --> 00:18:41,722
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

257
00:18:43,983 --> 00:18:44,623
Vice President Behrs.

258
00:18:44,663 --> 00:18:44,983
Yes.

259
00:18:45,484 --> 00:18:46,224
Councilor Kerrio.

260
00:18:46,284 --> 00:18:46,564
Yes.

261
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:47,844
Councilor Collins.

262
00:18:49,865 --> 00:18:50,045
Yes.

263
00:18:51,908 --> 00:18:52,368
Councilor Naito?

264
00:18:52,448 --> 00:18:54,569
Councilor Scarpelli?

265
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:54,929
Yes.

266
00:18:55,550 --> 00:18:56,130
Councilor Sands?

267
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:56,990
Yes.

268
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:58,711
Councilor Morocco?

269
00:18:58,991 --> 00:18:59,192
Yes.

270
00:18:59,432 --> 00:19:02,113
Six in the affirmative, one in the negative, the motion passes.

271
00:19:05,434 --> 00:19:10,117
Going to 23-287, notice of a public hearing.

272
00:19:11,137 --> 00:19:20,582
The Medford City Council will hold a continued public hearing in the Howard F. Alden Chambers of Medford City Hall, 85 George P. Hassett Drive, Medford via Zoom on Tuesday, June 6th at 7 p.m.

273
00:19:21,496 --> 00:19:49,187
A link to be posted no later than Friday, June 2, 2023 on a petition from Luis P. Santos, Oasis Restaurant, Silva & Content, LLC, 373 Main Street, Medford, Mass, 02155, for a special permit to amend its hours of operation in accordance with Medford Zoning Ordinance Chapter 94-7.2.1 to operate extended hours at its business at 373 Main Street, Medford, Mass, 02155, and said site being located in a Commercial 1 Zoning District C1 as follows.

274
00:19:49,714 --> 00:20:03,888
extended hours of operation requested 11pm through 1am Sunday through Saturday petition and plans may be seen in the office of the city clerk room 103 Medford City Hall Medford mass call 781-393-2425 for any accommodation slash aids.

275
00:20:03,948 --> 00:20:13,398
The city of Medford is an EOAA 504 employer by order of the city councilor council sign Adam L. Hardeby city clerk advertise in the Medford transcript and summerville journal

276
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:15,635
May 4 and May 11, 2023.

277
00:20:16,596 --> 00:20:22,562
If the petitioner wants to come forward from Oasis first so we can get, we'll hear from Oasis first, the petitioner.

278
00:20:24,263 --> 00:20:33,593
I know there had been some discussion as far as amending the hours you're seeking so if you want to just tell us about the petition and then we do also have legal counsel on as Councillor Scarpelli had requested.

279
00:20:33,693 --> 00:20:33,973
Thank you.

280
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:41,934
was a misunderstanding the first one we applied to one o'clock.

281
00:20:41,954 --> 00:20:45,676
So we're not really needing to one o'clock.

282
00:20:45,696 --> 00:20:55,864
Our main thing now is to have it licensed until midnight if we can, just in case something happens on Friday night and Saturday night.

283
00:20:56,504 --> 00:21:00,207
If there's a party that comes late, like 1030 or 1045, that happens all the time.

284
00:21:00,747 --> 00:21:06,751
If there's a group of large people, they're gonna stay past 11, like for maybe half an hour, for 15 minutes,

285
00:21:07,872 --> 00:21:09,792
I don't want to feel to operate illegal.

286
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:13,673
So if I could have until midnight, nothing's going to change.

287
00:21:13,753 --> 00:21:17,534
Our hours are going to stay the same during the week and Friday and Saturday.

288
00:21:18,074 --> 00:21:22,255
We have this license for 22 years, the common vehicle license until 11.

289
00:21:22,655 --> 00:21:24,295
So 11 is going to close anyway.

290
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:27,016
But I wanted to have the ability so people can stay in there.

291
00:21:27,316 --> 00:21:36,778
If there's a large group of people, if it's a small group, I'd rather to close and all my servers go home and my cooks go home.

292
00:21:37,378 --> 00:21:37,699
and the

293
00:21:53,735 --> 00:21:55,076
If I can, I thank you.

294
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:57,498
I know that we've been getting messages back and forth.

295
00:21:57,578 --> 00:22:01,101
And this is the reason why I asked for the extension.

296
00:22:01,341 --> 00:22:03,383
And I appreciate you working with the neighbors.

297
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:04,204
Yeah, we know.

298
00:22:04,244 --> 00:22:10,129
I know the neighbors are very happy with the the rules that you're putting in place your employees.

299
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:11,150
I think that's very important.

300
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,432
But so let's just so we can move forward.

301
00:22:13,472 --> 00:22:20,598
So you're asking for the extended hours until 12 o'clock just for Fridays and Saturdays and Wednesday night and Wednesday night special

302
00:22:21,438 --> 00:22:28,708
that we advertised, but we had a good meeting with the neighbors, and they're happy the way we talked.

303
00:22:28,788 --> 00:22:30,810
This is exactly what I was hoping for.

304
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:37,639
So if we're looking at the conversation we had back and forth with both everybody talking in favor for you and

305
00:22:39,111 --> 00:22:43,033
the respect that you have for the neighbors, the neighbors they have for you, my friend.

306
00:22:43,674 --> 00:22:51,039
So I would, I know we still have to move forward, but so to be clear, it's Wednesday, Fridays, and Saturdays until 12 o'clock.

307
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,760
Okay, thank you.

308
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,621
You're welcome, thank you.

309
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:55,443
And then did you have specific questions for Attorney Austin?

310
00:22:55,903 --> 00:23:01,747
Well, what the question was, if it was going to be, you know, if we were gonna deny it,

311
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:06,132
you know, in what grounds do we have to deny the special permit?

312
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:21,263
So I think that with this resolution, I know we'll hear from the residents, but if we don't see any conflicts, I appreciate the council for being here, but we wouldn't need their involvement because that answer would be new.

313
00:23:21,624 --> 00:23:22,104
So thank you.

314
00:23:22,604 --> 00:23:25,907
Okay, and as this is a public hearing, I have to take comments in a specific order.

315
00:23:25,927 --> 00:23:27,909
So I'm going to take comments.

316
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:31,511
in favor of the paper first, if there's, I'll open up.

317
00:23:31,531 --> 00:23:32,472
How do you know what I'm gonna say?

318
00:23:33,052 --> 00:23:34,193
You don't know if they're in favor or opposed?

319
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:34,693
You in favor?

320
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:35,074
Yeah.

321
00:23:35,354 --> 00:23:35,494
Okay.

322
00:23:35,534 --> 00:23:35,754
Okay.

323
00:23:35,954 --> 00:23:39,237
Yeah, it's just because it's a specific order for this type of hearing.

324
00:23:39,337 --> 00:23:40,918
So name and address.

325
00:23:41,018 --> 00:23:46,823
I'm Louise D'Antonio, 41 Dartmouth Street, which is perpendicular to Yale Street, and I've grown up in that neighborhood.

326
00:23:47,403 --> 00:23:48,765
I wanted to report on the meeting.

327
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:56,631
Despite what some people may have thought, we had a very vigorous, respectful meeting,

328
00:23:58,317 --> 00:24:05,078
All people at the meeting, including the mayor's representative from the Portuguese Brazilian council was present.

329
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:12,060
We were able to express our ideas, our thoughts, our concerns without being held back.

330
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,280
And it was a very honest, productive meeting.

331
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:24,742
We spoke about the hours, but one of the things that we all agreed upon was that

332
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:35,167
That area between 1130 and one o'clock, 1.30 in the afternoon has very little enforcement, parking enforcement.

333
00:24:35,627 --> 00:24:44,529
We also both agree that there has to be more enforcement in the evening in the parking lot at those late hours.

334
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,390
So we're going to try to make

335
00:24:47,969 --> 00:24:51,070
some contact with the police department or something.

336
00:24:51,550 --> 00:25:02,433
I don't know how many cars are available, but if you have a problem in a specific area at a specific time, that's when you send people down there.

337
00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:10,635
You don't wait until two hours later, drive down the street, see that there are no cars there, and then say, well, what's the problem?

338
00:25:11,715 --> 00:25:13,175
So... Ms.

339
00:25:13,195 --> 00:25:16,096
D'Antonio, if I can, I know I asked for

340
00:25:17,246 --> 00:25:37,745
for this meeting specifically because I didn't think that this was just the issue with just with oasis I think the enforcement was big so I recommended that we had legal counsel here, the police chief, the DPW traffic commission, I mean the traffic director as anybody else here.

341
00:25:39,732 --> 00:25:41,492
We should, I think we asked for the parking director also.

342
00:25:41,652 --> 00:25:43,013
And the parking director.

343
00:25:43,073 --> 00:25:45,513
We have the building commissioner here.

344
00:25:45,573 --> 00:25:46,193
I do not see.

345
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:48,414
Not the building, but really is really having.

346
00:25:48,794 --> 00:25:49,754
I think that's important.

347
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:54,475
One of the things I wanted to mention, we have no disagreement with the restaurants.

348
00:25:55,035 --> 00:25:55,655
Not at all.

349
00:25:56,275 --> 00:26:02,976
But a year ago, some residents in another part of the city complained about not being able to park on their street.

350
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:07,497
And then within a week, there were signs and barriers.

351
00:26:08,532 --> 00:26:13,645
Now that's a different section of the city, but they got a response very quickly.

352
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:16,433
So thank you for asking for that meeting.

353
00:26:18,055 --> 00:26:18,895
I look forward to that.

354
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,217
Yeah, well, I'm a little disappointed because we asked him to come tonight.

355
00:26:21,877 --> 00:26:28,881
And that was one of the reasons wasn't just, it wasn't just the community members and the business owners to talk and glad you did.

356
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:38,186
But the other reason why we call this because it was concerns of other issues that I think the enforcement was bringing in the negativity of the business owners

357
00:26:38,706 --> 00:26:56,586
where we have to make sure that there's a plan in place, whether it's signage, whether we talk to the traffic commission, and do residents only from certain times or set up, you know, patrols in the parking lot area, and around the same time is the closing of the establishment.

358
00:26:56,606 --> 00:26:59,209
So this is the these are the questions I wanted to ask

359
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:03,371
the the departments that are relevant to get us.

360
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:04,211
I agree.

361
00:27:04,251 --> 00:27:06,092
But the thing is, you can have a lot of signs.

362
00:27:06,132 --> 00:27:08,954
But if there's no enforcement, I don't science science.

363
00:27:09,234 --> 00:27:10,415
So thank you for your time.

364
00:27:10,475 --> 00:27:10,915
Thank you.

365
00:27:10,995 --> 00:27:11,495
Appreciate it.

366
00:27:11,815 --> 00:27:12,216
Thank you.

367
00:27:12,396 --> 00:27:15,437
And just the resolution we had was just about legal counsel.

368
00:27:15,457 --> 00:27:18,059
I think you may have mentioned that but they didn't put it in.

369
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:20,920
Okay, so I think that'll be something we'll have to follow through.

370
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,961
I think for the neighbors.

371
00:27:22,461 --> 00:27:27,404
I think the feedback that I got back from the neighbors was that, you know, really, is

372
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:45,937
is giving South Method the respect that they deserve and the residents there that they deserve, and making sure that there's some sort of a plan that the administration can work with the traffic department, the chief of police, and making sure that they step up dedicated patrols if that's what's needed in the evenings.

373
00:27:45,977 --> 00:27:52,742
But I think the piece that bothered me the most, the phone calls that I got, were the elderly neighbors that said that, you know,

374
00:27:53,482 --> 00:27:55,244
the blocking of the driveways.

375
00:27:55,964 --> 00:28:01,589
And to say that it was Oasis's fault, I didn't believe that.

376
00:28:01,689 --> 00:28:05,011
I think that the issue really is having the

377
00:28:08,197 --> 00:28:08,777
enforcement.

378
00:28:09,077 --> 00:28:12,839
And I think that we need to, you know, I know it's not a popular thing to do.

379
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:21,402
But when you throw a few tickets on a few cars, and somebody gets told because a senior citizen can't back up out of the driveway for an emergency reason.

380
00:28:21,842 --> 00:28:30,446
I think that's more important to me than any anybody's uncomfortable situation of going to get their their automobile out of impound because they didn't park and

381
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:32,527
a reasonable area.

382
00:28:32,547 --> 00:28:42,855
So I think that's something down the line we need to really call for a meeting, whether it be a committee of the whole or subcommittee on public safety, and really bring the neighbors back out.

383
00:28:42,995 --> 00:28:44,036
So thank you, Madam President.

384
00:28:44,636 --> 00:28:44,937
Thank you.

385
00:28:45,717 --> 00:28:48,479
Is there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of the petition?

386
00:28:48,499 --> 00:28:52,703
And that would be the owners if you want to speak in favor once more, if you want to just come up.

387
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:54,224
So you're in favor?

388
00:28:54,704 --> 00:28:55,065
Yes.

389
00:28:56,666 --> 00:28:57,927
Anyone else who would like to speak in favor?

390
00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:04,834
Seeing none, is there anyone else, anyone who would like to speak in opposition of the petition before us?

391
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:06,895
Please come up to the podium.

392
00:29:08,816 --> 00:29:15,098
Hi, my name is David Perella.

393
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:17,339
I'm at 16 Yale Street.

394
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,101
I would just like to go on record that I do oppose this.

395
00:29:24,862 --> 00:29:27,583
And I do think, so I've heard before that

396
00:29:28,571 --> 00:29:32,032
you can't come up with a reason why you would deny this.

397
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,152
Well, I can give you one reason.

398
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:39,313
I think you have an obligation to protect the quality of life of the residents.

399
00:29:41,394 --> 00:29:42,394
And it's that simple.

400
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:48,035
So I simply wanna go on record saying I do not support this and I hope that you will reconsider.

401
00:29:48,055 --> 00:29:50,096
Thank you.

402
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:50,796
Thank you.

403
00:29:50,816 --> 00:29:54,937
Is there anyone else who would like to speak in opposition either on Zoom or in person?

404
00:29:58,851 --> 00:30:02,916
Seeing none portion of the public hearing is closed any further discussion from the council.

405
00:30:04,858 --> 00:30:05,478
Councilor Carville.

406
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:06,900
Thank you.

407
00:30:07,861 --> 00:30:17,371
I would hope that I wasn't in on some of the meetings but I would hope that in the restaurant they will put some signs up for the customers to respect the neighborhood.

408
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:20,940
That's part of the discussion.

409
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:29,428
The part of the discussion with the owners, we're going to place signs not only in the facility, but also as they walk around toward the public parking area.

410
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:36,514
And I believe it's going to be in a few different languages, just for our Portuguese speaking patrons.

411
00:30:36,554 --> 00:30:37,595
So we appreciate that.

412
00:30:37,615 --> 00:30:42,320
And I think that's the, you know, and I appreciate that the general came up and talked about, you know.

413
00:30:44,329 --> 00:30:49,694
And maybe we should notify the other restaurants that are in that block also about what's happening.

414
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:51,296
He's not the only one there.

415
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:51,836
I agree.

416
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:53,578
I think that we should ask you.

417
00:30:53,658 --> 00:30:54,959
There's two other restaurants there.

418
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,461
Maybe you should be notified also.

419
00:30:57,317 --> 00:30:58,378
Maybe community development?

420
00:30:58,578 --> 00:30:58,778
Yeah.

421
00:30:59,118 --> 00:30:59,799
That's a good idea.

422
00:30:59,819 --> 00:30:59,919
Yes.

423
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:05,423
To reach out to Bocelli's and I think Mace Cafe stays open a little later.

424
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:20,575
So maybe reaching out to them, form a motion that maybe that the liaison to the businesses can reach out and see what they can do to make sure that they can post some signage or, you know, for their patrons to also respect that neighborhood.

425
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:21,736
Do you want to make that a B paper?

426
00:31:21,936 --> 00:31:22,377
Could you please?

427
00:31:22,397 --> 00:31:22,937
I'm sorry.

428
00:31:23,938 --> 00:31:25,899
So do you have that language, Mr. Clerk?

429
00:31:38,174 --> 00:31:47,777
So we have a B paper from Councillor Scarpelli to ask community development to reach out with signage for all of the restaurants in the area that utilize that parking lot.

430
00:31:48,777 --> 00:31:50,278
Do I have a second for that B paper?

431
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:54,779
That's right.

432
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:55,980
So we'll take the B paper first.

433
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,301
So on the motion of Councillor Scarpelli, seconded by Councillor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

434
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:03,042
And this is for the B paper, not the main petition.

435
00:32:04,543 --> 00:32:04,703
Yes.

436
00:32:04,723 --> 00:32:04,843
Yes.

437
00:32:04,963 --> 00:32:05,284
Yes.

438
00:32:05,844 --> 00:32:06,084
Yes.

439
00:32:06,744 --> 00:32:06,925
Yes.

440
00:32:07,165 --> 00:32:07,425
Yes.

441
00:32:07,585 --> 00:32:07,745
Yes.

442
00:32:27,453 --> 00:32:32,056
Second by, so we want to move approval of the amended.

443
00:32:32,536 --> 00:32:36,979
Monday, Friday, Saturday, the Wednesday, Friday, Saturday extended hours until midnight.

444
00:32:37,019 --> 00:32:37,380
Correct.

445
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,561
Correct.

446
00:32:39,601 --> 00:32:43,804
Thank you.

447
00:32:44,565 --> 00:32:45,766
And that is seconded by.

448
00:32:45,786 --> 00:32:49,468
Mr. Clark, please call the roll when you're ready.

449
00:32:57,777 --> 00:32:59,318
Yes.

450
00:33:00,058 --> 00:33:02,100
Yes.

451
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,641
Yes.

452
00:33:03,741 --> 00:33:04,001
Yes.

453
00:33:05,542 --> 00:33:05,822
Yes.

454
00:33:07,563 --> 00:33:07,763
Yes.

455
00:33:08,083 --> 00:33:12,906
Seven the affirmative zero negative the motion passes the petition is approved pending the six day public comment period.

456
00:33:14,147 --> 00:33:14,567
Thank you.

457
00:33:18,449 --> 00:33:20,410
Petitions presentations and similar papers.

458
00:33:22,443 --> 00:33:47,060
23 dash 321 petition for a common victors license by Ranga Narasimhan nine shadow lane and over mass 01810 for med sub LLC subway at 4110 Mystic Valley Parkway Medford mass oh 2155 representing med sub LLC district manager Manal Patel, I will go with the petitioner can come up, and I will also go to Councilor Scarpelli who is the chair of our licensing subcommittee.

459
00:33:49,762 --> 00:33:52,183
Want to tell us a little bit about the business.

460
00:33:52,223 --> 00:33:54,784
I mean, we're all familiar with Subway, but do you want to just tell us what you're seeking?

461
00:33:55,864 --> 00:33:59,066
Yeah, it's a fast food restaurant.

462
00:33:59,546 --> 00:34:05,228
We've been doing this one for close to 10 years now.

463
00:34:05,728 --> 00:34:09,609
And we have multiple locations.

464
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,630
And this one, we just started.

465
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:15,791
We took over from the previous owner.

466
00:34:16,091 --> 00:34:17,032
They're running the business.

467
00:34:18,072 --> 00:34:19,653
and we just took over this one.

468
00:34:19,673 --> 00:34:20,894
So it's nothing changed.

469
00:34:21,014 --> 00:34:22,594
Everything's going to be the same as it is.

470
00:34:22,614 --> 00:34:23,455
The hours are the same.

471
00:34:23,755 --> 00:34:25,856
It's not extended, correct, because that goes with the owner.

472
00:34:25,876 --> 00:34:29,918
So all this is just changing of ownership from one subway.

473
00:34:30,158 --> 00:34:30,358
Yes.

474
00:34:30,598 --> 00:34:30,758
Right.

475
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:31,939
The subway and Mystic Ave.

476
00:34:32,259 --> 00:34:32,479
Yes.

477
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:32,859
Okay.

478
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,621
And this is that you have only five employees that work for you?

479
00:34:36,782 --> 00:34:38,744
Yeah, it's like a few part timer.

480
00:34:38,964 --> 00:34:39,104
Yeah.

481
00:34:39,164 --> 00:34:42,287
And, like, you know, one is a free time.

482
00:34:42,407 --> 00:34:45,250
Okay, it's probably just what I just said.

483
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,652
Yeah, I'm sorry, Mr. So many mistakes.

484
00:34:46,832 --> 00:34:47,793
Yeah, I apologize.

485
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:49,615
Are we still going to honor the $5 for one.

486
00:34:57,703 --> 00:35:06,427
Madam President, I see everything in order, all paperwork's in order, so I would move approval after my colleagues have any comments.

487
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:07,227
Thank you.

488
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:09,148
Any further discussion from the council?

489
00:35:09,428 --> 00:35:13,289
Seeing none, so on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

490
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:14,490
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

491
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:15,910
Vice President Paris.

492
00:35:16,311 --> 00:35:16,611
Yes.

493
00:35:17,171 --> 00:35:17,731
Councilor Carviello.

494
00:35:17,771 --> 00:35:18,071
Yes.

495
00:35:18,371 --> 00:35:18,952
Councilor Collins.

496
00:35:19,632 --> 00:35:19,892
Yes.

497
00:35:20,832 --> 00:35:21,273
Councilor Naito.

498
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:21,933
Yes.

499
00:35:22,193 --> 00:35:22,913
Councilor Scarpelli.

500
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:23,574
Yes.

501
00:35:23,734 --> 00:35:24,294
Councilor Sanz.

502
00:35:26,795 --> 00:35:26,995
Yes.

503
00:35:29,316 --> 00:35:32,098
Yes, seven the affirmative zero negative the motion passes.

504
00:35:32,118 --> 00:35:32,918
Congratulations.

505
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:34,580
Thank you for being here so long.

506
00:35:36,281 --> 00:35:41,605
Going to motions, orders and resolutions 23 dash 313 offered by vice and bears.

507
00:35:42,185 --> 00:35:54,014
He is so resolved by the Metro City Council that the subcommittee on ordinances and rules need to consider an ordinance establishing a municipal compensation advisory board to consistently study the adequacy of compensation of all municipal officials

508
00:35:54,485 --> 00:36:01,611
and employees and create a report on a regular basis that is kept on file for the benefit of the public and the city's elected officials, vices and affairs.

509
00:36:01,851 --> 00:36:15,622
Thank you, Madam President, I'll be brief as I think this is relatively self explanatory, but something that we've been asking for, and it hasn't come to fruition yet, although our new HR director said they are working on it as a classification and compensation study.

510
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:34,784
This would actually create something that exists in several other communities, which is an advisory board to conduct such a study regularly and provide regular updates to make sure that the salaries offered to all municipal employees are competitive.

511
00:36:34,864 --> 00:36:39,467
So I would move to refer this to the subcommittee on ordinances and rules for further discussion.

512
00:36:40,008 --> 00:36:42,470
Any further discussion by the council?

513
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:47,318
On the motion of vice-president Behrs, seconded by Councilor Knight.

514
00:36:47,398 --> 00:36:48,419
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

515
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:58,307
Vice-president Behrs.

516
00:36:58,407 --> 00:36:58,667
Yes.

517
00:36:59,387 --> 00:37:00,028
Councilor Kerrio.

518
00:37:00,188 --> 00:37:00,508
Yes.

519
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:01,749
Councilor Collins.

520
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:02,550
Yes.

521
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,051
Councilor Knight.

522
00:37:04,191 --> 00:37:04,451
Yes.

523
00:37:04,771 --> 00:37:05,532
Councilor Scarpello.

524
00:37:05,752 --> 00:37:06,052
Yes.

525
00:37:06,373 --> 00:37:06,953
Councilor Santa.

526
00:37:07,473 --> 00:37:07,714
Yes.

527
00:37:09,035 --> 00:37:09,555
President Raul.

528
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:10,236
Yes.

529
00:37:10,356 --> 00:37:12,697
Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

530
00:37:14,435 --> 00:37:24,243
23 dash three one four offer by Councilor Scarpelli be it so resolved the Metro City Council invite residents and the city engineer to speak with the city council regarding safety issues when it comes to private ways Councilor Scarpelli.

531
00:37:24,623 --> 00:37:25,424
Thank you, Madam President.

532
00:37:25,964 --> 00:37:36,212
This came about when the resident came to us who's been on the list, who lives in a private way who who's lived there for a long time in the city.

533
00:37:37,032 --> 00:38:00,452
she planted a tree, a rooting tree in front of her establishment, her home, and she sat on the list for three years and was informed by a city engineer, I believe, and I was hoping he was here, but obviously he's not, that the city engineer has now followed through with the hard line, which is a law that the city does not maintain private ways.

534
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:09,001
I will tell you I received many phone calls concerning public safety when it comes to these decisions.

535
00:38:10,082 --> 00:38:16,484
We can understand when it comes to doing these bigger projects and understand our rules and regulations when it comes to private ways.

536
00:38:17,084 --> 00:38:30,210
We understand that one of the biggest reasons that we don't receive enough funding from the state or the federal government is because Medford has, what people don't realize, an abundance of private ways.

537
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:35,993
And it really hurts our bottom line when it comes to road work in our community.

538
00:38:36,593 --> 00:38:44,477
So if you talk to most people that own homes on private ways, they have a lot of pride and they maintain their homes.

539
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:55,323
And this one person who has a very dangerous lip now because of a rooting tree and has been on this list, had now been told that this would not work.

540
00:38:55,404 --> 00:38:57,545
And we need to clarify this because

541
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:04,731
The truth of the matter is, if someone does still trip and fall, the burden falls back on who?

542
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:06,232
Not the resident.

543
00:39:07,132 --> 00:39:11,115
It comes back to this council and the city and legal action.

544
00:39:11,735 --> 00:39:15,998
So if you see those suits that we've had in the past, 3,500, 5,500, these all add up to a pretty good number.

545
00:39:16,018 --> 00:39:17,299
But more importantly,

546
00:39:24,757 --> 00:39:32,284
I fear that it's going to be that elderly person that walks down that private way, smashes their head and God forbid passes.

547
00:39:33,145 --> 00:39:42,493
And I think this is something that to just be passive about changing this rule as a new new city engineer, and

548
00:39:43,191 --> 00:39:53,966
And I wish he was here because I'd like to ask him some questions that the residents that did reach out to him from what I've been told was that it was very arrogant in his presentation.

549
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:59,875
And to me as a city employee, municipal employee, that person works for the residents of the city.

550
00:40:00,885 --> 00:40:02,646
And I think that's the biggest piece.

551
00:40:02,686 --> 00:40:17,912
I think that we need to have guidelines set by this administration, really informing the people in the private ways of these rule changes or not to rule changes, but the the the persistence of following those rules now.

552
00:40:18,832 --> 00:40:21,353
Now, I got a phone call from another resident.

553
00:40:21,733 --> 00:40:25,655
And he said, Well, George, we live over here near Arthur Winthrop Street.

554
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:34,124
My neighbors and I, three years ago, followed the rule and we brought in a hot top company because the street was deplorable.

555
00:40:34,764 --> 00:40:42,786
And they talked to these professionals and said, because this isn't a major way, you should use this type of top, this type of patch.

556
00:40:43,386 --> 00:40:46,047
They repaved the whole street on their dime.

557
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:47,567
They did it right.

558
00:40:48,508 --> 00:40:53,589
And then they're upset now because during the Winthrop Street project,

559
00:40:54,925 --> 00:40:58,787
The city diverted all of the traffic where?

560
00:40:59,788 --> 00:41:01,069
Through this private way.

561
00:41:02,009 --> 00:41:12,196
Now, because of the hot top that was laid, because of the trucks that drove down that road consistently, their street is now in disarray.

562
00:41:13,316 --> 00:41:24,243
So their question that I wanted to ask the city engineer, if this is the case, what fair is fair, is the city now liable for repaving that street?

563
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:28,972
And that's a logical point.

564
00:41:29,773 --> 00:41:35,475
But again, when you're not talking, you're not communicating with your residents, this is a huge concern.

565
00:41:36,655 --> 00:41:38,616
So these are the things that are open-ended.

566
00:41:38,636 --> 00:41:54,703
And I would make the motion that we ask the city administration to please set up guidelines to re-educate our constituents on the follow through now of our new engineer and the policies that they're now following through or not following through.

567
00:41:55,852 --> 00:42:08,987
and the fact that what if the city is diverting the public traffic into their private ways and destroying these roadways that have just been paved?

568
00:42:09,788 --> 00:42:13,432
So I like to get these answered for these constituents because

569
00:42:15,224 --> 00:42:20,892
The next step is they said they would come here and the eight people that I did talk to said, you could use my name.

570
00:42:20,992 --> 00:42:25,177
And I said, you know what, let's see what the answers are in the follow through.

571
00:42:25,197 --> 00:42:27,681
Because I will tell you, for the residents that are listening,

572
00:42:28,773 --> 00:42:46,840
This is very frustrating for us because we ask these questions, not because we want to be rabble rousers because that's because this city administration has come up here and said, well, our, our, our directors, our directors in different departments are actually afraid to come to city council because of backlash or aggressive behavior.

573
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:52,462
And this is what we're putting office we're putting office to be their voice.

574
00:42:53,659 --> 00:43:00,743
And that's not an easy place to stand, but when you were elected or you're hired in a municipal field, that's part of your job.

575
00:43:01,763 --> 00:43:03,484
That's your, that's part of your job requirements.

576
00:43:03,544 --> 00:43:11,328
Come here and answer these questions so residents can understand what the process is.

577
00:43:11,868 --> 00:43:14,890
I'm just, I'm not sure if I heard councilor Scott Pelley right.

578
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:20,933
Is he saying that the staff of the mayor who came up here and said that she's holding people accountable?

579
00:43:21,915 --> 00:43:24,457
is scared to come before this council and be held accountable.

580
00:43:25,218 --> 00:43:37,747
That's what it sounds like to me Council Scott Pelley is that they're scared to come before the city council and be held accountable, but the mayor comes up here and beats her chest, saying how she's holding people accountable when she's getting dragged out of here and handcuffs and making them undergo psychological evaluations.

581
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:44,933
So I'm a little concerned about that and I thank the council for bringing that up and that's a very good point, but I know, and I'll end with this.

582
00:43:46,614 --> 00:43:53,929
I think we need more communication through the administration to really let our constituents know of these processes.

583
00:43:56,854 --> 00:43:59,616
When no one comes up to answer these questions, everything's left open-ended.

584
00:44:00,277 --> 00:44:07,502
And the frustration gets to a boiling point where we're seeing good people in this community putting for sale signs and moving out.

585
00:44:07,922 --> 00:44:09,904
And that I hate to see.

586
00:44:10,244 --> 00:44:13,046
And all it is sometimes is just simple conversation.

587
00:44:13,347 --> 00:44:17,069
You saw what we did tonight with a very, very, very

588
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:21,492
productive business in our city and neighbors that had an issue.

589
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:28,197
They got to sit down together because we opened the line of communication for them and they found the best avenue for both parties.

590
00:44:28,897 --> 00:44:33,941
So these are the things we need in our community and I think the city administration is really failing us.

591
00:44:34,001 --> 00:44:35,882
So thank you, Madam President.

592
00:44:42,045 --> 00:45:07,341
Thank you, President Morrell and I think the two specific questions that counselors are probably raised at the end are important ones to resurface for constituents I think if he's making a motion to have a committee of the whole on those two I think, I think that these are topics that we've talked about a lot this term already and I think that our city engineer and others in the engineering department have offered really helpful insight I mean just for me as an individual counselor and resident.

593
00:45:08,021 --> 00:45:11,064
The issue of how private ways interact with the rest of the city.

594
00:45:12,165 --> 00:45:20,712
Obviously, it's it's genuinely confusing and they've given us good counsel before and I think that sort of that causal chain like if this then what if you live on a private way.

595
00:45:21,393 --> 00:45:26,958
Clearly there's still more residents that we have to reach with that information I agree that we need a better communication strategy for that.

596
00:45:28,339 --> 00:45:32,343
I just wanted to raise you know I, I, I think that, um,

597
00:45:33,655 --> 00:45:34,096
Yeah, no.

598
00:45:34,657 --> 00:45:35,678
This is clearly an issue.

599
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:44,313
One, because it's come up again, because it's come up so many times before this term, whether we've been talking about in the chambers, and I know that I've had one-on-one conversations with residents.

600
00:45:45,463 --> 00:45:48,406
many times in my pretty short term so far.

601
00:45:48,426 --> 00:45:55,833
I've had to go to the engineer and ask him for insight that I then relay back to the residents just about the various issues involved in living on private ways.

602
00:45:55,873 --> 00:46:08,065
And the other thing that I think is important to note in this conversation in terms of, you know, what are the reasons that we're not serving our constituents and our constituents on private ways, you know, to the best of our ability is everybody is trying to

603
00:46:09,046 --> 00:46:11,410
make do with pretty scarce resources.

604
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:18,140
I remember one of the things that I've heard from members of our DPW staff and our engineer in the past is, you know,

605
00:46:18,896 --> 00:46:22,759
matters of public safety are always prioritized when possible.

606
00:46:22,899 --> 00:46:29,983
But our ceiling for what's possible is really low, and budgets are extremely tight when everybody's operating on skeleton resources.

607
00:46:30,564 --> 00:46:38,229
And I don't think that that is always the decision of individual staff people, but just operating in a very austere environment.

608
00:46:38,249 --> 00:46:46,574
So I think that's important to bring into conversation, because when we're talking about safety of our residents and safety of our residents in our private ways,

609
00:46:48,619 --> 00:47:02,460
The decisions that we make and the decisions that the administration makes about the resources that we have to deploy around our community in the interest of aesthetics and public safety, that trickles down to individual cases like this.

610
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:21,034
And so I think it's fair to say we need insight from this position specifically and that role specifically, but also to say, if we don't have resources to go around where most of the people who come to us with an issue on a private way leave that conversation disappointed, we need to take a hard look at our books and see what would it take to be able to better serve those residents.

611
00:47:21,094 --> 00:47:27,940
Because as I know, we've talked as a council about how expensive it is to bring a private way back into the public fold.

612
00:47:28,866 --> 00:47:39,050
Um, you know, those are residents that were that we are sort of agreeing to leave in that situation when we don't build towards a plan where we can bring those back under public jurisdiction.

613
00:47:39,511 --> 00:47:47,974
So I just wanted to raise the point that I think that this is this is part of the long term strategy to that we've been talking about all year is, you know, sort of lacking comprehensiveness.

614
00:47:48,714 --> 00:47:48,995
Thank you.

615
00:47:49,955 --> 00:47:50,975
Thank you, Councilor Carvio.

616
00:47:51,296 --> 00:47:51,976
Thank you.

617
00:47:51,996 --> 00:47:52,636
Thank you, Madam President.

618
00:47:52,656 --> 00:47:53,376
No, this is something.

619
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:56,955
that we get questions on all the time.

620
00:47:57,336 --> 00:48:06,398
But it seems like over the last year and a half is when these issues seem to come to a head.

621
00:48:07,778 --> 00:48:13,520
The TPW in the past has always maintained these roads for the people and the best they could.

622
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,641
They trimmed trees and they did whatever they could.

623
00:48:18,001 --> 00:48:22,702
Now we're at the point, since this new engineer is taking over and under the administration,

624
00:48:23,853 --> 00:48:29,741
We expect the people to pay for their own tree trimming, pay for their own street, pay for everything.

625
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:35,091
and I don't see them getting a reduction in their tax rate.

626
00:48:35,832 --> 00:48:41,014
They pay the same amount of taxes that everybody else in this room pays, and they're entitled to the same amount of services.

627
00:48:41,334 --> 00:48:50,517
Not what our engineer decides is his idea of services, because this has just started under this new watch in the last year and a half.

628
00:48:50,537 --> 00:48:59,681
So I thank Councilor Scott Pate for bringing this up, but this is, I say, this DPW has always taken care of these issues, and now they don't.

629
00:49:01,141 --> 00:49:01,982
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

630
00:49:03,102 --> 00:49:04,043
Thank you, Madam President.

631
00:49:04,143 --> 00:49:06,765
I don't think that the engineer is the bad guy in this situation.

632
00:49:06,845 --> 00:49:16,832
I think that the engineer is the fall guy, which is a difference because we've had previous administrations in this community that have allowed private ways to be provided with maintenance and services, okay?

633
00:49:17,152 --> 00:49:20,354
And the only thing that's different is the administration, right?

634
00:49:20,394 --> 00:49:22,395
So this is definitely an administrative prerogative.

635
00:49:22,936 --> 00:49:24,957
It's something that we're seeing come down from the top.

636
00:49:25,437 --> 00:49:29,160
It's not coming from the engineer across the city, it's coming from the boss, the mayor, all right?

637
00:49:30,037 --> 00:49:43,484
So when we talk about this resolution and we talk about the issues that Councilor Scott Pelli brings up, he says that the city is not maintaining private waste, which would infer that we're maintaining public waste, and we're not doing that either.

638
00:49:44,124 --> 00:49:59,252
But when we talk about the services that you're entitled to and receive access to as a resident on a private way, we talk about access to the public schools, access to public safety and first response, snow removal and trash removal.

639
00:50:01,773 --> 00:50:02,795
We don't get trees trimmed.

640
00:50:02,895 --> 00:50:04,057
We don't get sidewalks fixed.

641
00:50:04,097 --> 00:50:05,038
We don't get streets paved.

642
00:50:05,659 --> 00:50:07,122
What about the underground infrastructure?

643
00:50:07,843 --> 00:50:09,505
Is that the responsibility of the taxpayer?

644
00:50:09,546 --> 00:50:10,868
Is that the responsibility of the city?

645
00:50:13,092 --> 00:50:16,474
Okay, so where does it stop and where does it start is a big question.

646
00:50:17,135 --> 00:50:27,442
Now, I don't think people who live on private ways have a problem living on a private way, quite frankly, I don't think people that live on a private way would have a problem paying for some of these services that they want themselves.

647
00:50:28,282 --> 00:50:33,946
I think part of the problem is that they can't get anybody to provide them with help when they want to initiate their rights at City Hall.

648
00:50:34,707 --> 00:50:39,330
So if I lived on a private way and I said look at I want to put up a crash bar and I want to say resident access only.

649
00:50:40,612 --> 00:50:43,634
Say Wildwood Road, for example, right across the street from Medford High School.

650
00:50:43,855 --> 00:50:44,595
It's a private way.

651
00:50:45,256 --> 00:50:54,703
Why can't they put up, just like they have on Rosina Drive in the Heights, on Murray Hill Road in the Heights, a crash bar where cars can't drive down that street because it's a private way.

652
00:50:55,944 --> 00:50:57,265
And they can tell you when and when you can't.

653
00:50:57,845 --> 00:51:00,467
The fire department can still provide emergency access.

654
00:51:00,487 --> 00:51:02,188
The police department can still have emergency access.

655
00:51:02,228 --> 00:51:03,589
The MS can still have emergency access.

656
00:51:06,322 --> 00:51:20,572
and these residents that live on the streets that are abutting the Mystic Lakes complain year in and year out about the fact that neighborhoods being overrun and inundated by people that are parking on their private ways in front of their houses and their driveways and the like to access the Mystic Lakes.

657
00:51:22,313 --> 00:51:28,477
But the city doesn't provide them with the information or the tools necessary to protect themselves on their private way, but won't provide them the services either.

658
00:51:29,038 --> 00:51:30,078
It becomes very frustrating.

659
00:51:30,919 --> 00:51:33,761
And inaction is not an answer or a response.

660
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,481
to a circumstance in the community.

661
00:51:37,362 --> 00:51:46,910
So meetings are great, but ultimately we've had a number of meetings on this back in September and even previously, and we're still talking about it because there's been inaction.

662
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:52,394
And that's the difference between what makes a thriving community and what makes a failing community.

663
00:51:52,934 --> 00:52:02,382
So when we talk about the one thing that people want when they move into a city is they wanna make sure that their tax dollars stretch a long way, they get banked for their buck and they're provided with city services.

664
00:52:03,391 --> 00:52:08,075
We have over 30% of the streets in this community that are private ways and we're not providing those people with services.

665
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,137
Thus far, I feel as though we're failing them.

666
00:52:10,818 --> 00:52:22,128
We're failing them because we're not providing them with any recourse information or ability to enact or enact their rights or enable themselves to protect their, their investment in their future destiny in the community.

667
00:52:22,428 --> 00:52:23,069
Thank you, Madam President.

668
00:52:23,089 --> 00:52:23,910
Thank you.

669
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:25,171
President bears.

670
00:52:25,631 --> 00:52:27,393
Thank you, Madam President, I just wanted to note that.

671
00:52:28,215 --> 00:52:38,663
We did hold a meeting on private ways with the DPW commissioner on October 25th, 2022, and that recording is available through Medford Community Media.

672
00:52:38,843 --> 00:52:47,429
And there's also more information about the city's policies on private ways around enforcement on the city website and the police department website.

673
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:48,250
Thank you.

674
00:52:49,222 --> 00:52:54,727
And just go probably apologize was your motion to have a committee of the whole on this topic and invite the city engineer, or.

675
00:52:54,747 --> 00:53:03,754
Madam President, I think that the goal for this is really to educate the constituents, and

676
00:53:04,842 --> 00:53:10,125
And so I would like to see a community hall with those residents of private ways, get the word out.

677
00:53:10,205 --> 00:53:34,399
And I appreciate Councilor Knight and Councilor Baez sending that information, but when you are living to a certain standard here, and you've grown up in a private way or lived in a private way, and all of a sudden snap a finger, the way that you've lived your life, things have changed now, whether it's right, wrong or indifferent.

678
00:53:36,375 --> 00:53:51,809
The residents that live in those private ways have to be reeducated and really have to acknowledge what needs to be expected as they move on.

679
00:53:51,849 --> 00:53:54,391
If this is the way it goes, like Councillor Knight said,

680
00:53:55,478 --> 00:53:58,080
the I don't blame the city engineer in any way.

681
00:53:58,921 --> 00:54:04,906
I question his his behavior or his tone with what residents have told me.

682
00:54:04,926 --> 00:54:11,751
And you know, I'd like I said, if he was here, I'd love to ask him but but that's the what I question with our our city engineer.

683
00:54:12,192 --> 00:54:13,453
Again, my question is really

684
00:54:14,962 --> 00:54:18,843
you're making changes, sweeping changes that are really affecting our community.

685
00:54:19,624 --> 00:54:26,546
And especially when it comes to public safety, when people are expecting their sidewalks to get done.

686
00:54:26,566 --> 00:54:35,369
Because imagine if, like Councilor Knight said, you have a sidewalk that's panels lifted, you have an elderly parent that lives in your home with you.

687
00:54:36,069 --> 00:54:41,111
You're expecting the city to make these changes because they've been on this list, so they wait.

688
00:54:42,377 --> 00:54:45,204
Now all of a sudden they're told that after three years you're top of that list.

689
00:54:45,545 --> 00:54:48,492
They know we're not fixing it because you're a private way.

690
00:54:48,713 --> 00:54:49,715
We're changing our policy.

691
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:52,735
So that's the process.

692
00:54:52,775 --> 00:55:00,960
I think we need to meet with all of these departments and really set the tone with how to reeducate our private way residents.

693
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:13,748
And then maybe they have to answer some questions about legitimate questions that were brought about on detours and sending heavy trucking that ruined a street that has just been paved.

694
00:55:13,848 --> 00:55:16,029
So these are legitimate issues.

695
00:55:16,169 --> 00:55:17,290
So thank you, Madam President.

696
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:18,234
Thank you guys.

697
00:55:18,394 --> 00:55:38,740
President bears Thank you Madam President, and I just want to reiterate I don't disagree with that at all I think this actually really speaks to why it's so important that the mayor approves these charter ballot questions that we just move forward, and we implement the better budget plan because we need to have an honest conversation what is it going to cost to bring everything up to a state of good repair, what is it going to cost to bring all these private ways in the public domain.

698
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:40,860
and we need a plan for it.

699
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:44,861
And right now we don't even have the process to have the conversations to come up with a plan.

700
00:55:44,921 --> 00:55:49,843
So we're stuck with scheduling this meeting and that meeting and the police have a meeting and we had a subcommittee meeting.

701
00:55:49,883 --> 00:55:52,543
Now we have a committee, the whole meeting, but we need a budget plan.

702
00:55:53,143 --> 00:55:57,245
And so that's why I'm so glad that the council moved forward on these amendments.

703
00:55:57,365 --> 00:56:01,506
And I really hope that the mayor moves forward on them as well so that the voters can have a choice.

704
00:56:03,366 --> 00:56:04,186
Thank you, Vice President Farris.

705
00:56:04,306 --> 00:56:05,647
So we have a motion from

706
00:56:08,419 --> 00:56:10,940
We have a motion from apologies.

707
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:11,300
Okay.

708
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:17,581
We have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli for a committee of the whole to invite the city engineer as well as all residents.

709
00:56:17,681 --> 00:56:17,822
Okay.

710
00:56:18,022 --> 00:56:22,483
On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Carviello.

711
00:56:22,523 --> 00:56:24,243
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

712
00:56:40,245 --> 00:56:42,186
Vice President bears.

713
00:56:42,226 --> 00:56:42,446
Yes.

714
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:43,386
Yes.

715
00:56:44,106 --> 00:56:44,306
Yes.

716
00:56:45,267 --> 00:56:45,707
Yes.

717
00:56:45,827 --> 00:56:47,047
Yes.

718
00:56:47,107 --> 00:56:47,347
Yes.

719
00:56:47,767 --> 00:56:48,227
Yes.

720
00:56:48,828 --> 00:56:49,068
Yes.

721
00:56:50,148 --> 00:56:50,648
Yes.

722
00:56:50,828 --> 00:56:51,028
Yes.

723
00:56:51,108 --> 00:57:03,352
I'm in the affirmative zero negative the motion passes to three dash three to two offered by Councillor night be resolved in preparation for budget discussions at the city administration furnish the following information related to school spending.

724
00:57:04,055 --> 00:57:08,139
One, cost to date for the per diem payments made to David Murphy, former assistant superintendent.

725
00:57:08,359 --> 00:57:13,485
Two, cost of KP law investigation of the MHS softball team and results of findings of the investigation.

726
00:57:14,005 --> 00:57:20,011
Three, cost per week related for teachers covering hallway security details in MHS since the much publicized stabbing incident.

727
00:57:20,532 --> 00:57:25,877
Four, an explanation of the difference in duties and responsibilities of the following positions, data manager and data director.

728
00:57:26,483 --> 00:57:36,209
and read an explanation as to the reasoning behind the salary disparity between the positions and five costs and copy of the report performed by Welch et al relative to school safety and security.

729
00:57:36,269 --> 00:57:36,789
Councilor Knight.

730
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:38,591
Madam President, thank you very much.

731
00:57:38,811 --> 00:57:45,075
These are some items that have been popular fodder for discussion in our community over recent months.

732
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:50,378
Recently, the school department has met and they've discussed their budget priorities.

733
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:53,740
Looks like they're about eight or $900,000 short from where they'd like to be.

734
00:57:56,712 --> 00:58:04,416
I've always had an issue with the school committee and their ability to manage within their budget sometimes.

735
00:58:05,316 --> 00:58:10,018
I feel like sometimes you've got to make hard decisions, and that's what elected officials are putting these positions for.

736
00:58:10,878 --> 00:58:17,021
And when it comes time to tightening the belt and spending within your means, sometimes our school committee does not do that.

737
00:58:17,481 --> 00:58:20,122
And as a result, we see some wasteful spending.

738
00:58:21,022 --> 00:58:24,424
It's been brought to my attention that some of these cost items that are

739
00:58:25,224 --> 00:58:29,207
included in this list, Madam President, are reaching astronomical figures.

740
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:43,516
For example, it's my understanding that the cost for teachers covering hallway security duties is somewhere around $25,000 to $35,000 a week of ARPA money being spent for teachers to monitor the hallways up in Method High.

741
00:58:44,076 --> 00:58:45,297
So when we're talking about

742
00:58:46,999 --> 00:58:49,844
a school committee's professed shortfall of about $800,000.

743
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:55,915
Let's take a look at some of the spending that we're doing when we talk about the investigation into the NHL softball team.

744
00:58:56,015 --> 00:58:57,518
I know we have attorney Howard Greenspan

745
00:58:58,653 --> 00:59:00,894
as the school department's attorney who's on retainer.

746
00:59:01,274 --> 00:59:03,134
Did KP Law conduct the investigation?

747
00:59:03,314 --> 00:59:03,514
Why?

748
00:59:04,074 --> 00:59:05,775
Why did KP Law conduct the investigation?

749
00:59:05,815 --> 00:59:06,995
Was that a special contract?

750
00:59:07,075 --> 00:59:10,216
Was that something that fell outside the scope of our contract with KP Law?

751
00:59:10,576 --> 00:59:11,916
Is that something we're going to be assessed for?

752
00:59:12,116 --> 00:59:12,876
How much did it cost?

753
00:59:12,976 --> 00:59:14,457
What were the findings of the investigation?

754
00:59:14,917 --> 00:59:16,057
Was it a worthy expenditure?

755
00:59:16,457 --> 00:59:19,458
Should we have used internal counsel that we have on retainer or should we have gone outside?

756
00:59:20,513 --> 00:59:21,393
Is this wasteful spending?

757
00:59:22,034 --> 00:59:28,616
So Madam President, these are some things that I want to take a look at when we talk about the position of data manager and the position of data director.

758
00:59:29,516 --> 00:59:32,817
From what I understand, they have the exact same duties, responsibilities and functions.

759
00:59:33,477 --> 00:59:34,878
The only difference is the salary.

760
00:59:36,018 --> 00:59:42,201
the incumbent that's in the position is a female who's going to make $10,000 to $15,000 less than the new appointee who's a male.

761
00:59:42,822 --> 00:59:45,123
But their responsibilities and duties really aren't that different.

762
00:59:45,303 --> 00:59:46,483
So I want to know what's going on.

763
00:59:46,523 --> 00:59:50,305
Why is there such a disparity in the wages between these two positions?

764
00:59:50,506 --> 00:59:53,407
And why is there a need for two positions with duplicate duties?

765
00:59:55,028 --> 00:59:56,629
Also, you know,

766
00:59:57,753 --> 00:59:58,994
Medford High has been on the news a lot.

767
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:01,656
It's not for winning state championships, all right?

768
01:00:01,876 --> 01:00:04,058
It's because of violence in our school department.

769
01:00:04,718 --> 01:00:06,720
So the school department went and they hired a consultant.

770
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:10,523
They spent a lot of money on a consultant to file a report, and this report makes suggestions.

771
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:26,514
I want to know what these suggestions are, what the cost of the report was, and whether or not these suggestions are even being implemented, or whether it was just a, let's get us out of the news, hire a consultant to come in here and do a report, and then we can wave the report in the air and say, no, we did something, but not implement any of the changes that they've asked for.

772
01:00:27,737 --> 01:00:41,082
So when we talk about previous administration of the school department, and we talk about a gentleman like Mr. Belson, who'd come before us, and who would talk about school violence, well, Roy was one of the founders of the STARS program, right?

773
01:00:41,402 --> 01:00:47,304
The School Threat Assessment and Response System that's been implemented statewide, okay?

774
01:00:49,165 --> 01:00:54,307
That was in response to an issue back in the early 90s.

775
01:00:56,495 --> 01:01:06,202
What steps has this administration taken to put in something like a STARS program that would assess violence on our school systems and establish reasonable response?

776
01:01:09,224 --> 01:01:11,046
So these are some of the things that I have great concern about.

777
01:01:11,446 --> 01:01:15,389
We all talk about you can't put a price tag on public safety, but apparently you can't.

778
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:22,835
I mean, if this is any truth to this expenditure at $33,000 a week in APA funds being assigned for teachers to monitor the halls,

779
01:01:24,287 --> 01:01:31,690
I think that's gross negligence in terms of spending, and it's a gross negligence of the fiduciary responsibility of the stewards of our taxes.

780
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:33,830
So it's pretty self-explanatory.

781
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:39,272
When we get the answers to the questions, we'll be in a better position to figure out exactly what's going on here.

782
01:01:39,892 --> 01:01:44,894
This council's been asking now for financial data for three years, and we haven't been receiving it forthwith.

783
01:01:45,294 --> 01:01:53,537
So my hope was to put this on the agenda to give everybody ample notice and time to prepare it, to give it to us before our budget discussions finalize at the end of the month, Madam President.

784
01:01:53,999 --> 01:01:54,299
Thank you.

785
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:56,721
Any further discussion from the council?

786
01:01:59,744 --> 01:02:15,036
Seeing none, on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Kerrio, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

787
01:02:16,497 --> 01:02:17,317
Temporarily absent.

788
01:02:19,739 --> 01:02:19,799
No.

789
01:02:26,348 --> 01:02:26,808
That's right.

790
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:27,629
Yes.

791
01:02:28,569 --> 01:02:29,330
Yes.

792
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:31,051
Yes.

793
01:02:31,671 --> 01:02:31,911
Yes.

794
01:02:36,354 --> 01:02:36,594
Yes.

795
01:02:37,435 --> 01:02:43,639
So five in the affirmative one in the negative one absent motion passes to three.

796
01:02:44,659 --> 01:02:49,842
This is a paper that also includes vices and Pharisees out but I will keep going.

797
01:02:52,488 --> 01:02:53,168
Would you like me to wait?

798
01:02:53,389 --> 01:02:54,849
We'll survive without him, Madam President.

799
01:02:55,330 --> 01:02:55,550
Sorry?

800
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:56,531
We'll survive without him.

801
01:02:56,671 --> 01:02:56,931
Okay.

802
01:02:57,751 --> 01:03:02,855
It's a zoning paper, but 23-323 offered by Councilor Carvalho, Councilor Collins, and Vice President Behrs.

803
01:03:03,415 --> 01:03:07,458
Proposed amendments to the Medford zoning ordinance for June 2023.

804
01:03:07,698 --> 01:03:14,202
Number one, amend table of use and- Madam President, motion to waive the reading and refer to the CD board as pursuant to Massachusetts General Election Act 41A.

805
01:03:14,782 --> 01:03:15,563
Thank you.

806
01:03:15,723 --> 01:03:22,167
So we have a motion from Councilor Nye to waive the reading and refer to the CD board, seconded by-

807
01:03:23,743 --> 01:03:31,908
Councilor Carviello, any discussion before we take that vote as this is procedural to refer to the CD board per MGL?

808
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:43,615
Seeing none, we have to, so yeah, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll to move the reading and refer to the CD board.

809
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:54,400
Yes.

810
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:54,501
Yes.

811
01:04:01,085 --> 01:04:01,565
President?

812
01:04:01,845 --> 01:04:04,387
Yes, six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent.

813
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:05,068
The motion passes.

814
01:04:05,088 --> 01:04:06,749
The paper is referred to the CD board.

815
01:04:06,869 --> 01:04:10,131
On that point, Madam President, I'd just like to ask that the city clerk calendar this event.

816
01:04:10,591 --> 01:04:17,215
As we know, because this is a zoning change, it's pursuant to certain rules and regulations established by state law that create timelines for us to act.

817
01:04:18,296 --> 01:04:20,518
And if we don't act in time, then we got to start over from scratch.

818
01:04:20,538 --> 01:04:25,181
And this is a very important matter that I think we need to keep an eye on when we're coming into summer break.

819
01:04:25,221 --> 01:04:26,702
Sometimes these things fall off the shelf.

820
01:04:26,882 --> 01:04:30,244
So I just ask that the city clerk keep us in line to make sure that we do our job.

821
01:04:30,818 --> 01:04:31,098
Thank you.

822
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:35,502
And I do see just Director Hunt and City Planner Daniel Evans are also on a call.

823
01:04:35,542 --> 01:04:38,345
So they're also paying attention to that timeline, I'm sure.

824
01:04:40,727 --> 01:04:43,769
So I will go to, I'm gonna thumbs up from Director Hunt.

825
01:04:43,809 --> 01:04:45,251
So she is on it as well.

826
01:04:46,252 --> 01:04:47,773
So, I'm sorry.

827
01:04:47,793 --> 01:04:49,935
21, okay.

828
01:04:51,236 --> 01:04:51,897
Skipping ahead to page 21.

829
01:04:56,289 --> 01:05:03,273
vacations from the mayor to three dash 324 to Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council regarding donation acceptances.

830
01:05:03,874 --> 01:05:20,564
Dear President Morella members of the city council I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves under MGL chapter 44 section 53 a a donation of $500 from Boston Proud Corp for the use of pride and a donation of $350 for instigators from instigators LLC to the city for filming in the

831
01:05:21,447 --> 01:05:25,248
for filming in the upper city hall mall, a lot respectfully submitted.

832
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:26,389
Brianna Longo, current mayor.

833
01:05:28,229 --> 01:05:28,649
Madam president.

834
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:29,790
Councilor Knight.

835
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:36,452
If we could get a written explanation from the city administration as to why someone would pay us for the use of pride, because I'm not too sure what that means.

836
01:05:36,752 --> 01:05:37,653
Yeah.

837
01:05:38,053 --> 01:05:39,473
That would be great, but it's 500 bucks.

838
01:05:39,733 --> 01:05:41,334
I mean, total value of this paper is $850.

839
01:05:41,374 --> 01:05:43,054
You know what I mean?

840
01:05:43,134 --> 01:05:45,815
I move approval on the paper, but I would like a written explanation.

841
01:05:46,416 --> 01:05:47,656
So we have a motion to approve.

842
01:05:48,436 --> 01:05:50,197
So we have a motion.

843
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:54,812
Councilor Knight to approve as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

844
01:05:55,633 --> 01:05:56,893
Any further discussion from the council?

845
01:05:58,154 --> 01:05:59,155
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

846
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:09,981
Vice President Behrs.

847
01:06:10,021 --> 01:06:10,301
Yes.

848
01:06:10,862 --> 01:06:11,462
Councilor Kerrio.

849
01:06:11,482 --> 01:06:11,962
Yes.

850
01:06:12,563 --> 01:06:13,143
Councilor Collins.

851
01:06:13,743 --> 01:06:13,983
Yes.

852
01:06:15,344 --> 01:06:17,285
Councilor Scarpelli.

853
01:06:17,445 --> 01:06:17,666
Yes.

854
01:06:18,206 --> 01:06:18,706
Councilor Seng.

855
01:06:19,427 --> 01:06:19,607
Yes.

856
01:06:21,638 --> 01:06:24,359
Yes, 70% negative the motion passes.

857
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:28,582
Communications from city officers and employees.

858
01:06:29,523 --> 01:06:32,345
This actually has the same number as the previous I should have caught that.

859
01:06:33,165 --> 01:06:33,946
We'll just update that.

860
01:06:35,887 --> 01:06:50,637
Okay, 23 dash 324 and we will update that preliminary election September 12 motion to waive the reading and have the city clerk announced the dates as to when that early voting will be available on the motion of Council night to waive the reading and have the city clerk announced the

861
01:06:51,103 --> 01:06:56,747
dates as to when early voting will be available, seconded by... I'd extend that to both papers, Madam President.

862
01:06:56,767 --> 01:06:57,448
To both papers.

863
01:06:57,468 --> 01:07:02,172
So we'll have an overview from the city clerk on both papers.

864
01:07:06,415 --> 01:07:07,916
I'm sorry?

865
01:07:08,196 --> 01:07:09,197
From the elections manager?

866
01:07:11,079 --> 01:07:11,939
No.

867
01:07:11,959 --> 01:07:12,700
City clerk, okay.

868
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:13,361
So we have a motion.

869
01:07:13,401 --> 01:07:18,885
Not after the last... We have a motion from Councillor Knight and seconded by...

870
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:30,866
Councilor Scarpelli, I believe, to waive the reading and have just the City Clerk brief us on the dates for early voting and the municipal election.

871
01:07:31,127 --> 01:07:33,568
And I believe there's actually three papers.

872
01:07:37,391 --> 01:07:38,332
Actually no, that's a separate one.

873
01:07:38,392 --> 01:07:39,593
Okay, on those two papers.

874
01:07:40,614 --> 01:07:41,574
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

875
01:07:42,295 --> 01:07:42,655
There's a no.

876
01:07:50,753 --> 01:07:51,454
Councilor Nielsen.

877
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:52,274
Yes.

878
01:07:54,876 --> 01:07:55,317
Councilor Knight.

879
01:07:55,497 --> 01:07:55,737
Yes.

880
01:07:55,797 --> 01:07:57,298
Councilor Scarpelli.

881
01:07:57,458 --> 01:07:57,779
Yes.

882
01:07:58,439 --> 01:07:58,980
Councilor Sanchez.

883
01:07:59,560 --> 01:07:59,840
Yes.

884
01:08:01,422 --> 01:08:01,962
President Morrell.

885
01:08:02,803 --> 01:08:05,885
No, so five in the affirmative, two in the negative, motion passes.

886
01:08:06,065 --> 01:08:13,211
We were gonna waive the reading and have an update from the city clerk on the election dates that are before us in these papers.

887
01:08:16,914 --> 01:08:17,475
President Behrs.

888
01:08:18,453 --> 01:08:22,134
I respect what Councilor Knight's saying, but the city clerk's no longer involved in elections.

889
01:08:22,795 --> 01:08:27,176
I don't think we should try and do anything to not reinforce that they're separate offices.

890
01:08:29,097 --> 01:08:30,597
So that's just my opinion.

891
01:08:31,078 --> 01:08:31,778
Understood.

892
01:08:32,018 --> 01:08:40,281
I mean, we took the vote, the motion passed, we can have the clerk read the dates and then we can open up to participation on the paper.

893
01:08:40,441 --> 01:08:43,302
So if anyone else wants to speak.

894
01:08:44,642 --> 01:08:46,123
I mean, am I missing something here?

895
01:08:46,143 --> 01:08:48,965
All we're doing is announcing what the early voting dates are, because, you know what I mean?

896
01:08:48,985 --> 01:08:51,586
It seems like it's a pretty self-explanatory paper over there.

897
01:08:51,686 --> 01:08:53,988
All it is is a public service announcement, as far as I can tell, right?

898
01:08:54,328 --> 01:08:54,708
Understood.

899
01:08:54,968 --> 01:08:58,810
We'll have the clerk read, and then if anyone wants to speak on it as the candidate agenda item.

900
01:08:59,711 --> 01:09:11,898
For the preliminary election on September 12th, early voting dates, September 5th, which is a Tuesday from 8.30 to 4.30, September 6th, which is a Wednesday from 8.30 to 7.30,

901
01:09:13,794 --> 01:09:21,058
September 7th, a Thursday from 830 to 430 and September 8th, a Friday from 830 to 1230 p.m.

902
01:09:27,481 --> 01:09:30,643
That's the hours for the September election.

903
01:09:30,663 --> 01:09:40,228
Proposed hours for the November 7th election for early voting.

904
01:09:42,526 --> 01:09:43,727
Monday, October 30th from 8.30 to 4.30.

905
01:09:44,147 --> 01:09:45,027
Tuesday, October 31st from 8.30 to 4.30.

906
01:09:45,067 --> 01:09:47,009
Wednesday, November 1st from 8.30 to 7.30.

907
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:48,189
Thursday, November 2nd from 8.30 to 4.30 p.m.

908
01:09:48,209 --> 01:09:49,070
Any discussion from the council?

909
01:10:12,949 --> 01:10:14,170
Why is there no Saturdays here?

910
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:16,210
Is there a reason?

911
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:31,395
No, we've done it in the past on Saturdays.

912
01:10:31,955 --> 01:10:35,576
Saturdays when there are federal and state elections because it's a local election.

913
01:10:36,115 --> 01:10:43,919
We're trying to keep it during the week when we have staff in hand and keep the overtime hours down.

914
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,181
But we are not required.

915
01:10:46,401 --> 01:10:48,202
It's a courtesy to voters.

916
01:10:48,562 --> 01:10:54,005
The reason why this information is presented to you tonight is because it's an opt-in situation.

917
01:10:54,085 --> 01:11:00,969
So we're requesting that you accept our presentation on early voting hours, early voting person hours.

918
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:02,970
Thank you.

919
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:04,671
Vice President Behrs.

920
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:13,063
The paper before us has no language on it, legal or otherwise, saying it doesn't mean the City Council opt in to support early voting.

921
01:11:13,083 --> 01:11:16,384
It doesn't tell us when the dates are going to be.

922
01:11:16,824 --> 01:11:23,565
So from a legal standpoint, I mean, usually if there's an opt-in, there's some certain language that you need to adopt or support in order for an opt-in to happen.

923
01:11:24,725 --> 01:11:26,366
Are you able to offer clarity on that?

924
01:11:26,466 --> 01:11:28,166
Is this something that the Council needs to know?

925
01:11:28,206 --> 01:11:32,247
That's not the paper that's before us this evening.

926
01:11:32,807 --> 01:11:34,587
Sure, I can offer clarification.

927
01:11:35,588 --> 01:11:51,154
What we're doing is the Election Commission has approved within their meetings the dates of early voting, and as a courtesy to the board at the City Council, we're offering them the opportunity just to agree and accept that these are the dates that we're going to do.

928
01:11:51,695 --> 01:11:54,896
And if there were any questions, we would answer any questions about that at that time.

929
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:55,296
OK, thank you.

930
01:11:55,316 --> 01:11:55,976
So it's a courtesy.

931
01:11:56,016 --> 01:11:57,497
It's not something that would change anything.

932
01:11:57,517 --> 01:11:58,517
So we don't have to take any action.

933
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,962
There's a courtesy.

934
01:12:04,042 --> 01:12:08,206
It's not a necessary mechanism of government for us to take a vote for this to happen, right?

935
01:12:08,246 --> 01:12:10,368
It's going to happen no matter what.

936
01:12:10,989 --> 01:12:14,812
It's important, informative, and we also just appreciate you.

937
01:12:15,487 --> 01:12:17,168
accepting what we've presented to you.

938
01:12:17,188 --> 01:12:23,130
We don't have to write the board just an autonomous board that's made its determination and they're presenting us their findings.

939
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:25,451
I'm fine with that.

940
01:12:25,731 --> 01:12:27,032
Thank you.

941
01:12:27,272 --> 01:12:28,112
Thank you, Madam President.

942
01:12:28,172 --> 01:12:31,033
I for one, I'm not comfortable with not having Saturdays.

943
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:33,034
I think Saturdays are really important for early voting.

944
01:12:33,054 --> 01:12:35,695
I think we know municipal elections are the least

945
01:12:38,802 --> 01:12:42,085
I think we should give them the most opportunity to get people to vote.

946
01:12:43,206 --> 01:12:49,631
This is why I was so concerned with the budget presented to us for the election office because it sounds like we're trying not to spend more money this year.

947
01:12:49,651 --> 01:12:55,755
So we're not going to do early voting on Saturdays for municipal election when we're electing the mayor and the city council, the school committee.

948
01:12:56,716 --> 01:13:05,964
the three offices probably that actually impact residents' lives the most of any government office versus I'm pretty sure I know how Medford's gonna vote in November 2024 and 2026 and 2028.

949
01:13:06,024 --> 01:13:12,350
Hope, maybe I'm wrong, I don't know.

950
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:21,778
So I just feel really uncomfortable not having the Saturdays and

951
01:13:22,817 --> 01:13:29,963
I think we've done more, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe we've done more early voting for municipal elections in previous years than this amount that's being offered.

952
01:13:31,384 --> 01:13:38,389
So for state, I can't speak to early voting for municipal elections prior to this.

953
01:13:38,909 --> 01:13:51,619
I know that early voting with the state, they do give us requirements as to what we have to offer when it's a state and federal election required to do Saturdays and Sundays based on the population of the city of Metzger.

954
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:56,160
What I will offer to you is I understand that Saturdays are important.

955
01:13:56,220 --> 01:14:01,682
However, when we've done elections on Saturdays, they are lower turnouts.

956
01:14:02,642 --> 01:14:16,686
And so the idea is that if we keep the election availability during the week, as well as doing early voting via ballots, early mail to ballots, we actually may get the same amount of people as opposed to offering Saturday time.

957
01:14:18,004 --> 01:14:18,264
Okay.

958
01:14:18,404 --> 01:14:18,645
Yeah.

959
01:14:18,705 --> 01:14:25,392
I mean, we definitely last general election offered five days early voting, including a Saturday as well as vote by mail.

960
01:14:25,973 --> 01:14:28,615
And I think we should at least continue with what we've done in the past.

961
01:14:29,536 --> 01:14:31,098
Is that for a municipal election?

962
01:14:31,118 --> 01:14:32,840
That was municipal election, November 2nd, 2021.

963
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:33,120
Okay.

964
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:33,481
Thank you.

965
01:14:38,718 --> 01:14:38,978
Thank you.

966
01:14:38,998 --> 01:14:44,684
I just wanted to add my voice to the choir supporting Saturday early voting dates.

967
01:14:44,905 --> 01:14:58,059
I mean, respectfully, I think it's really important for accessibility, and even if Saturday sees lower turnout, per se, a lot of those voters might only be able to vote on Saturday, or that might be the most

968
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,761
by far the most convenient option for them.

969
01:15:00,922 --> 01:15:05,925
And I wouldn't want to take that piece of our democracy away.

970
01:15:06,826 --> 01:15:14,851
And so anything we can do to sustain that, to keep that as an option, I think is really important.

971
01:15:14,871 --> 01:15:18,994
Thank you, Councillor Seng.

972
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:19,635
Councillor Collins.

973
01:15:21,336 --> 01:15:22,437
Thank you, President Morrell.

974
01:15:22,957 --> 01:15:23,598
I agree with that.

975
01:15:23,698 --> 01:15:27,880
I think that having a weekend opportunity is very important.

976
01:15:27,961 --> 01:15:29,962
You know, people have different schedules, different work schedules.

977
01:15:30,362 --> 01:15:34,065
I also want to note to Election Manager Ripley, I apologize.

978
01:15:34,105 --> 01:15:36,046
I think I misunderstood the previous motion we took.

979
01:15:36,066 --> 01:15:47,674
I certainly didn't want to preempt your office's opportunity to speak on the presentation that you've created, especially since this is an opportunity to get the word out to residents and voters about what to expect for our

980
01:15:49,221 --> 01:15:57,028
elections in September and November, so I know there's a lot of, you know, great kind of FAQ information submitted onto our agenda.

981
01:15:58,189 --> 01:16:09,839
Certainly, if there's anything more that you wanted to share or were planning to share relating to the Miss Paul elections, the sort of know before you go section, I'd certainly be eager to hear that from your office.

982
01:16:10,059 --> 01:16:10,360
Thank you.

983
01:16:12,021 --> 01:16:12,301
Thank you.

984
01:16:12,381 --> 01:16:12,882
Councilor Carvell.

985
01:16:13,397 --> 01:16:21,900
President, I'd make a motion that these papers be sent back to the commission for re-examination and reconsideration for Saturday voting.

986
01:16:25,095 --> 01:16:26,957
The paper requires an election from the council.

987
01:16:27,517 --> 01:16:27,878
Yeah.

988
01:16:27,918 --> 01:16:32,521
So my worst fear is Oh, well, I didn't get a chance to vote because early voting wasn't open on Wednesday, the 5th.

989
01:16:32,661 --> 01:16:34,103
Well, the city council approved the schedule.

990
01:16:34,383 --> 01:16:36,184
City Council has no authority on this whatsoever.

991
01:16:36,885 --> 01:16:39,227
So we can recommend that they open on Saturday.

992
01:16:39,247 --> 01:16:40,068
I don't have a problem with that.

993
01:16:40,408 --> 01:16:43,911
But in terms of supporting the plan and not supporting the plan, we don't have to do it.

994
01:16:43,951 --> 01:16:46,193
I don't think we should.

995
01:16:46,213 --> 01:16:50,096
We do have a motion on the floor before yours from Council night to receive a place on file.

996
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:56,772
Before we get to that, I just also want to add my voice to the chorus of just concerns about not having a Saturday voting.

997
01:16:56,832 --> 01:16:58,753
I think Councilor Sang made a really good point.

998
01:16:58,773 --> 01:17:03,797
I understand that it may be lower turnout numbers, but that may be the only date those people can vote.

999
01:17:03,897 --> 01:17:06,819
We don't know that, but I think it's really important to have.

1000
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:11,102
So it's something we have had in the past that people, you know, they may have voted that way.

1001
01:17:11,122 --> 01:17:15,204
They may have voted on Saturday two years ago, and they're counting on voting on Saturday this year.

1002
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:17,546
And to find out they can't, they may have missed their window.

1003
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:18,887
So I just want to add to that.

1004
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:23,876
So a motion from Councilor Knight to receive and place a file seconded by Vice President Behrs.

1005
01:17:24,696 --> 01:17:25,757
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1006
01:17:26,998 --> 01:17:27,818
Vice President Behrs?

1007
01:17:27,878 --> 01:17:27,998
Yes.

1008
01:17:28,919 --> 01:17:29,519
Councilor Kerrio?

1009
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:29,960
Yes.

1010
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:31,281
Councilor Collins?

1011
01:17:31,741 --> 01:17:31,941
Yes.

1012
01:17:34,163 --> 01:17:34,623
Councilor Knight?

1013
01:17:34,943 --> 01:17:35,263
Yes.

1014
01:17:35,623 --> 01:17:36,344
Councilor Scarpelli?

1015
01:17:36,644 --> 01:17:36,884
Yes.

1016
01:17:37,124 --> 01:17:37,665
Councilor Singh?

1017
01:17:38,505 --> 01:17:38,726
Yes.

1018
01:17:39,606 --> 01:17:40,126
President Morrell?

1019
01:17:40,347 --> 01:17:40,567
Yes.

1020
01:17:40,767 --> 01:17:42,908
Seven in favor, zero negative, the motion passes.

1021
01:17:43,389 --> 01:17:44,129
So that was 324 and 325 together.

1022
01:17:44,189 --> 01:17:44,689
We do also have 326.

1023
01:17:51,592 --> 01:17:59,254
So page paper 3.6 is just a listing of, you know, we're open seats for the 20 June 1st 2023.

1024
01:17:59,454 --> 01:18:03,634
Sorry, the date of submission is June 1st.

1025
01:18:03,654 --> 01:18:12,636
So the municipal election open seats for 2023 is City Council, seven seats, two year term, Mayor, one seat, two year term, and school committee, six seats, two years term.

1026
01:18:12,856 --> 01:18:13,516
President.

1027
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:19,571
just wanted to add a couple questions.

1028
01:18:19,652 --> 01:18:25,377
This is separate from the call to election, which you're gonna put before us at a later date to put this on the ballot.

1029
01:18:26,378 --> 01:18:27,399
Okay.

1030
01:18:28,399 --> 01:18:33,224
And sorry, I didn't ask it when you were talking about vote by mail, just a little bit ago.

1031
01:18:34,185 --> 01:18:42,632
We've had a relationship with the post office in Medford around vote by mail, the last few elections, given the just sheer volume.

1032
01:18:43,593 --> 01:18:45,774
in 2020, 2021, and 2022.

1033
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:48,276
What's the status of that relationship?

1034
01:18:49,937 --> 01:18:53,439
Is everything going to be in place for September and November?

1035
01:18:53,779 --> 01:18:57,281
And also, how has that been going with the census?

1036
01:18:57,321 --> 01:19:02,765
We touched on it last time we talked, but I just wanted to check on those two things really quick.

1037
01:19:03,285 --> 01:19:03,505
Sure.

1038
01:19:03,525 --> 01:19:09,969
So we have met with both the supervisor and the manager at the post office.

1039
01:19:10,009 --> 01:19:13,031
I met with them two weeks ago just to discuss what our needs were.

1040
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:22,115
The election calendar went out to them today just so that they're aware of when we're going to be sending things out and when we want to accept things in.

1041
01:19:24,337 --> 01:19:25,658
The gentleman's name is Brian.

1042
01:19:25,698 --> 01:19:27,339
Brian will be working closely with us.

1043
01:19:27,759 --> 01:19:39,426
We will have ID badges so that when we go over to the post office, the only people that can pick up elections materials will be someone in our office that has an ID badge and they're aware of those requirements.

1044
01:19:40,867 --> 01:19:42,388
When it comes to sending mail out,

1045
01:19:43,161 --> 01:19:48,305
We do now have these green tags that designate the envelopes as ballots.

1046
01:19:48,785 --> 01:19:53,788
Those are used across the state to ensure that the ballots are processed faster than other mail.

1047
01:19:54,369 --> 01:19:57,110
So that is something that was not in place and is now in place.

1048
01:19:57,451 --> 01:20:05,556
So what happens is, when we send ballots out, we wrap these green tags around the ballots, bring them to the post office, and they get processed more quickly.

1049
01:20:07,397 --> 01:20:07,698
Henry?

1050
01:20:08,641 --> 01:20:13,944
and the other commissioners will be assisting us when it comes to going to the post office if we need that.

1051
01:20:14,404 --> 01:20:22,147
The idea is that we should be able to do that ourselves within the office, within the, you know, just making sure we have coverage in the office and getting the balance.

1052
01:20:22,868 --> 01:20:23,568
Does that answer?

1053
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:27,210
Yeah, and just that arrangement's in place for the city census as well?

1054
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:27,850
It is, correct.

1055
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:27,990
Okay.

1056
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:36,534
Yep, it is all in place, and what we're doing is we're also prepping for the March election so the post office is aware of what our needs are for March as well.

1057
01:20:36,954 --> 01:20:37,655
Okay, thank you.

1058
01:20:38,671 --> 01:20:40,492
Can I bring up two things?

1059
01:20:40,592 --> 01:20:52,259
I don't know if it's appropriate or not, but I just want to make a reminder that the 13th, along with what we're talking about, the positions, the 13th is the day that nomination papers will be available in our office.

1060
01:20:52,699 --> 01:20:58,023
It's room 102, so please pass the word if people are going to be running for office to stop in.

1061
01:20:58,603 --> 01:21:02,105
The other thing is... I'm sorry?

1062
01:21:02,165 --> 01:21:03,386
They close on the 28th of July.

1063
01:21:07,249 --> 01:21:10,311
And that's the last date to pull papers?

1064
01:21:10,571 --> 01:21:12,893
That's the last day to submit papers to our office.

1065
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:15,295
The papers will be certified by August 8th.

1066
01:21:15,555 --> 01:21:16,516
What's the last day to pull?

1067
01:21:17,296 --> 01:21:18,137
The last day to pull?

1068
01:21:18,817 --> 01:21:20,298
Hold on, let me look at my notes here.

1069
01:21:21,459 --> 01:21:22,160
I apologize.

1070
01:21:25,262 --> 01:21:27,043
Ah, come on.

1071
01:21:28,104 --> 01:21:30,165
The last day to pick up nomination papers is July 21st.

1072
01:21:32,662 --> 01:21:46,174
As a reminder with regards to nomination papers, I just want to make sure that everybody remembers that if they have not returned their census, they need to return the postcard in order to be eligible to sign nomination papers.

1073
01:21:48,115 --> 01:21:52,039
We've sent out the mailing for the inactive voters for the census.

1074
01:21:52,099 --> 01:21:55,261
We just want to make sure people understand they have to sign something.

1075
01:21:55,642 --> 01:21:56,883
Otherwise, when they go to the polls,

1076
01:21:57,584 --> 01:21:57,744
on the

1077
01:22:18,812 --> 01:22:26,658
Now historically, up until Sandy Gale became the elections manager, we never had this issue with the census and with people getting pulled from the list and everything else.

1078
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:28,200
It's been a nightmare ever since.

1079
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:30,181
It's created a ton of problems in this community.

1080
01:22:30,521 --> 01:22:32,843
We've had people coming up here saying the elections have been raked.

1081
01:22:32,923 --> 01:22:43,131
I remember Richard Brady Daugherty up here screaming and yelling saying that the elections raked and Zach Baer's fault because he talked to Sandy and they were colluding to remove people from the rolls and everything else.

1082
01:22:44,172 --> 01:22:46,933
It's a bad practice, you know, it didn't have that didn't happen.

1083
01:22:46,973 --> 01:22:55,475
But that was the that was the general consensus throughout the community was that, you know, Zach was running around trying to control the voting.

1084
01:22:55,795 --> 01:23:06,158
But anyway, what I'm saying is, why don't we cool it on that a little bit, relax a little bit, because it does create a situation where a lot of people get frustrated and it creates voter apathy, where they don't want to come out and vote.

1085
01:23:06,698 --> 01:23:10,419
and they don't want to go and waste their time going through this ordeal of this.

1086
01:23:10,699 --> 01:23:16,101
I know the elections are great, but they're overwhelmed when they get in there and they got one person that says, what do you mean I can't vote?

1087
01:23:16,301 --> 01:23:18,802
Well, listen, I just talked to 4,000 people that can and you can't.

1088
01:23:18,902 --> 01:23:20,062
Like, sorry, what do you want me to tell you guys?

1089
01:23:20,082 --> 01:23:22,783
Today's the biggest day of the year for me, right?

1090
01:23:22,943 --> 01:23:24,363
And they don't get the attention that they deserve.

1091
01:23:24,383 --> 01:23:27,004
And then they have to come down to city hall and go back and go back to the back.

1092
01:23:27,264 --> 01:23:27,964
They're not going to vote.

1093
01:23:27,984 --> 01:23:29,105
They're just not going to do it.

1094
01:23:29,665 --> 01:23:32,986
So I'll reiterate the fact, I don't think it's the best practice.

1095
01:23:33,646 --> 01:23:35,887
I mean, it might be what you're required to do, what you can do.

1096
01:23:35,907 --> 01:23:38,348
I think it's what you can do, not necessarily what you're required to do.

1097
01:23:38,908 --> 01:23:43,709
But I don't think that it's working in favor of promoting full involvement in elections.

1098
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:44,690
Thank you, Councilor Newton.

1099
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:46,230
I think that's an important point, but I want to make sure.

1100
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:49,731
So you're talking about signing papers specifically?

1101
01:23:49,751 --> 01:23:50,392
Correct.

1102
01:23:50,612 --> 01:23:50,692
Yep.

1103
01:23:50,712 --> 01:23:53,133
I want to make sure that people are active voters.

1104
01:23:54,781 --> 01:23:57,943
If you don't mind, I would love to explain to you the process.

1105
01:23:58,823 --> 01:24:02,946
We are required by law to send the census out.

1106
01:24:02,986 --> 01:24:08,529
By June 15th, we are required to inactivate voters who have not returned their census.

1107
01:24:09,009 --> 01:24:18,054
We've moved our timeframe up so that we have plenty of time to let people know through the postcards that they needed to let us know that they're still living in Medford.

1108
01:24:19,446 --> 01:24:23,831
example, like I have to fill out a census, I'm on the ballot, and I gotta fill out a census every year.

1109
01:24:23,971 --> 01:24:25,674
And I can't vote for myself if I don't.

1110
01:24:26,074 --> 01:24:26,555
This is crazy.

1111
01:24:26,575 --> 01:24:30,379
I can't sign my own nomination papers if I don't fill out the census, but I'm an elected official in the community.

1112
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:32,883
To be an elected official, I believe I have to be a registered voter.

1113
01:24:33,543 --> 01:24:33,764
Right?

1114
01:24:33,824 --> 01:24:36,247
So I'm not a registered voter right now because I didn't fill out the census.

1115
01:24:36,607 --> 01:24:37,767
No, there's a difference.

1116
01:24:37,947 --> 01:24:39,148
I apologize.

1117
01:24:39,508 --> 01:24:42,469
So an active voter simply means you haven't returned your census.

1118
01:24:42,569 --> 01:24:48,851
And we do everything in our power to make sure that any inactive voters are notified that they're inactive.

1119
01:24:49,511 --> 01:24:55,253
And that when they go to the polls, we may try and make it as easy as possible for them to be able to just show their ID and vote.

1120
01:24:55,674 --> 01:24:56,314
Right.

1121
01:24:56,394 --> 01:24:59,335
And what I'm saying is that the past practice was never like this.

1122
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:02,656
And it was always very, it was always a lot easier than what's going on now.

1123
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:06,642
Now, if this is the way it's going to be, this is the way it's going to be, that's fine.

1124
01:25:07,283 --> 01:25:12,708
I'm just saying that I don't think it's necessarily conducive to promoting full involvement in elections.

1125
01:25:14,189 --> 01:25:14,449
Thank you.

1126
01:25:16,551 --> 01:25:17,832
Vice President Paris.

1127
01:25:18,693 --> 01:25:30,343
I'm a little concerned because what I'm hearing is if people didn't fill out their census and they sign a nomination form, then those signatures will not be valid for the purposes of nomination.

1128
01:25:31,283 --> 01:25:32,643
That is my understanding correct.

1129
01:25:33,623 --> 01:25:35,904
Sorry, go ahead.

1130
01:25:35,944 --> 01:25:37,164
You can ask your question.

1131
01:25:37,784 --> 01:25:41,125
How many census forms went out and how many have been returned?

1132
01:25:41,345 --> 01:25:44,185
23,000 census forms were sent out to the households in Medford.

1133
01:25:45,025 --> 01:25:47,586
We have received back about 17,000.

1134
01:25:48,106 --> 01:25:47,586
17,000?

1135
01:25:50,006 --> 01:25:54,567
Yes, we sent another 15,000 cards out to registered voters.

1136
01:25:55,087 --> 01:26:00,268
Some of those cards come back as PO returns because the people have moved and they haven't notified us.

1137
01:26:00,966 --> 01:26:03,808
We are following up as quickly as we can.

1138
01:26:04,528 --> 01:26:07,590
We've received about 4,000 returns on the postcards to date.

1139
01:26:08,751 --> 01:26:10,312
So, and we're still having them come in.

1140
01:26:10,672 --> 01:26:13,754
And people can, the cards can come in any time.

1141
01:26:13,774 --> 01:26:16,636
I mean, there's no drop dead date for the cards.

1142
01:26:16,676 --> 01:26:20,379
We just would like to have the cards sent in before the September election.

1143
01:26:21,553 --> 01:26:25,857
Got it, so you're expecting most people who are active voters now will be active voters on June 16th?

1144
01:26:26,238 --> 01:26:26,838
Absolutely.

1145
01:26:27,058 --> 01:26:35,367
Okay, could you just communicate that number to us to let us know how many people were inactivated once that's completed?

1146
01:26:36,928 --> 01:26:38,790
So people have already been inactivated.

1147
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:44,816
So if they didn't send their census in by April 25th, we then sent out postcards to 15,000 people.

1148
01:26:46,671 --> 01:26:49,493
And we've gotten back about 4,000 postcards.

1149
01:26:49,593 --> 01:26:52,876
So we're still working on getting them in.

1150
01:26:53,236 --> 01:26:54,557
We process them every day.

1151
01:26:54,937 --> 01:26:58,681
We did go to the post office to check and make sure that the post office was sending them to us.

1152
01:26:59,321 --> 01:27:04,445
We made sure that we had all our business reply mail money in place so that the postcards aren't delayed at all.

1153
01:27:05,026 --> 01:27:13,553
If you could just at whatever point you feel, either if it's June 16th or before then, communicate to the council through the clerk and the president.

1154
01:27:15,351 --> 01:27:20,813
how many, what percentage of registered voters in the city are active versus inactive and how many were made inactive this year?

1155
01:27:20,833 --> 01:27:26,114
The percentage, it could be the actual number, it could be both, but you know.

1156
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:28,815
So about 15,000 voters were made inactive.

1157
01:27:29,015 --> 01:27:30,075
And how many voters are there?

1158
01:27:30,095 --> 01:27:32,156
Councillor Knight.

1159
01:27:32,356 --> 01:27:33,076
How many voters are there?

1160
01:27:33,096 --> 01:27:37,017
There are, so there are.

1161
01:27:37,857 --> 01:27:38,717
Including the 15,000 hit the road.

1162
01:27:41,024 --> 01:27:42,424
I don't have the number in front of me.

1163
01:27:42,504 --> 01:27:45,245
I don't want to quote a number that I would give you incorrectly.

1164
01:27:45,265 --> 01:27:47,866
It's like a third that you threw out, right?

1165
01:27:47,906 --> 01:27:48,286
Mm-hmm.

1166
01:27:48,306 --> 01:27:51,227
So like 33% of the registered voters are no longer, are inactive now.

1167
01:27:51,367 --> 01:27:51,687
They're inactive.

1168
01:27:51,707 --> 01:27:52,887
Because they didn't send back a census.

1169
01:27:52,927 --> 01:27:54,768
But there's 4,000 that have sent it in.

1170
01:27:54,928 --> 01:27:56,048
So we've reduced that.

1171
01:27:56,068 --> 01:27:56,448
Yeah, right.

1172
01:27:56,468 --> 01:28:02,310
But I mean, ultimately, you took a third of the population from inactive.

1173
01:28:02,350 --> 01:28:05,011
Correct, as required.

1174
01:28:05,031 --> 01:28:06,211
A third of the voting population, 33%.

1175
01:28:06,451 --> 01:28:08,692
As required by a law, yes.

1176
01:28:08,892 --> 01:28:09,292
That's crazy.

1177
01:28:12,218 --> 01:28:15,020
So there were 15,000 who hadn't returned, who were registered.

1178
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,881
Now they returned their postcards, so it's down to 11,000?

1179
01:28:18,102 --> 01:28:18,482
Correct.

1180
01:28:18,802 --> 01:28:19,082
Okay.

1181
01:28:19,362 --> 01:28:19,703
Correct.

1182
01:28:20,863 --> 01:28:30,649
And just to give you a perspective, Somerville, when we inactivated our folks, they had a 30% return rate on their census.

1183
01:28:30,689 --> 01:28:32,350
So our census was higher than that.

1184
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:37,333
My experience with Somerville have always been they make things very difficult for anybody to do anything over there.

1185
01:28:38,654 --> 01:28:39,074
Fair enough.

1186
01:28:41,403 --> 01:28:46,485
And does SARA follow a similar policy as far as how quickly they inactivate people?

1187
01:28:46,925 --> 01:28:47,145
Yes.

1188
01:28:47,485 --> 01:28:47,645
Yeah.

1189
01:28:47,785 --> 01:28:50,646
Everybody has to be inactivated by early June.

1190
01:28:51,146 --> 01:28:53,327
And what I did- What happens if they're not?

1191
01:28:53,587 --> 01:28:54,567
Do they turn into a pumpkin?

1192
01:28:55,407 --> 01:28:57,908
If they're not inactivated, we're not in compliance.

1193
01:28:58,228 --> 01:28:58,828
And then what happens?

1194
01:29:01,349 --> 01:29:03,330
I don't know what the state does if we're not in compliance.

1195
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:09,912
I just would prefer to be in compliance because I think it's important that we follow the rules that are given to us.

1196
01:29:10,812 --> 01:29:12,493
to uphold the integrity of the election.

1197
01:29:13,053 --> 01:29:19,615
I understand your frustration with the- I mean, you can't just throw a third of the people in the community off the voter rolls.

1198
01:29:19,635 --> 01:29:20,815
You want to say that they can still vote?

1199
01:29:20,835 --> 01:29:22,175
Listen, you made them inactive voters.

1200
01:29:22,195 --> 01:29:24,296
They're going to show up at the polls and they're going to say, no, you can't vote.

1201
01:29:24,636 --> 01:29:26,657
Go stand in the corner and fill it out in the bad boy booth.

1202
01:29:27,177 --> 01:29:27,397
Right?

1203
01:29:27,497 --> 01:29:28,537
I mean, that's what happens, right?

1204
01:29:28,677 --> 01:29:31,078
So it's hard enough to get people to want to participate.

1205
01:29:31,178 --> 01:29:32,578
And I just think that this is a failed policy.

1206
01:29:32,598 --> 01:29:34,099
It's not your policy.

1207
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:35,179
It's just a failed policy.

1208
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:36,979
You're saying it's to comply with the state law.

1209
01:29:36,999 --> 01:29:38,160
I think that doesn't make any sense.

1210
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:38,660
It's crazy.

1211
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:44,082
It's crazy if you fall off the, if you don't fill out your census form, but they not send you an excise tax bill, pretty sure they do.

1212
01:29:44,102 --> 01:29:45,323
You know what I mean?

1213
01:29:45,663 --> 01:29:46,283
Pretty sure they do.

1214
01:29:46,303 --> 01:29:49,905
So they're going to take away your right to have a voice, but they're still going to tax you.

1215
01:29:50,005 --> 01:29:58,408
One thing that we've, one thing that we have implemented in order to make the affirmations for inactive voters easier is we just have a roster.

1216
01:29:58,789 --> 01:30:06,752
So people are just, you know, there's four boxes, sign your name, what's your address and write your hand, write your name so that we know who you are.

1217
01:30:07,668 --> 01:30:13,810
It makes it much faster than having people fill out two or three forms, which is why there has been past practice.

1218
01:30:15,031 --> 01:30:19,192
So we'll continue to- That was the past practice beginning within the last 36 months.

1219
01:30:20,693 --> 01:30:22,554
Well, we'll continue to approve that process.

1220
01:30:23,174 --> 01:30:23,514
Thank you.

1221
01:30:23,534 --> 01:30:29,836
So we have a motion from Councilor Knight to receive and place on file, seconded by- Second.

1222
01:30:30,837 --> 01:30:33,538
Vice Mayor Behrs, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1223
01:30:39,046 --> 01:30:39,346
Thank you.

1224
01:30:39,366 --> 01:30:39,827
Thank you.

1225
01:30:39,847 --> 01:30:39,947
Yes.

1226
01:30:40,047 --> 01:30:40,147
Yes.

1227
01:30:40,167 --> 01:30:40,287
Yes.

1228
01:30:40,307 --> 01:30:40,547
Yes.

1229
01:30:40,567 --> 01:30:40,727
Yes.

1230
01:30:40,827 --> 01:30:40,928
Yes.

1231
01:31:00,847 --> 01:31:10,670
Madam President, there's a paper that I submitted to be included in the record this evening, pursuant to communications from city offices and employees, which is the section of the agenda that we're into this evening.

1232
01:31:13,191 --> 01:31:14,812
What am I skipping something.

1233
01:31:16,876 --> 01:31:19,278
I received a correspondence today from the firefighters union.

1234
01:31:20,319 --> 01:31:25,243
And at our last meeting, I believe that I do have the right to initiate a point of personal privilege.

1235
01:31:26,944 --> 01:31:30,147
The mayor told me that I was being distruthful at the meeting the other night.

1236
01:31:30,787 --> 01:31:42,297
And this was the same meeting that the mayor said that she was very close to settling all the union contracts and that they were doing a great job and they were this close to settling all the contracts, including the fire contract.

1237
01:31:43,017 --> 01:31:49,264
And this evening, Madam President, in our mailboxes before the meeting, we received a correspondence from the fire union.

1238
01:31:50,485 --> 01:31:54,430
And what it says is this administration has been in office for three years and five months.

1239
01:31:55,731 --> 01:32:01,978
Local 1033, I'm sorry, local 1032, which is the Metro Firefighters Union, has been without a contract for 706 days.

1240
01:32:04,993 --> 01:32:12,717
The mayor spoke last week about how well negotiations were going with the fire department and that we were close to settling a contract.

1241
01:32:14,999 --> 01:32:15,839
I just want to repeat that.

1242
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:23,463
The mayor spoke last week about how well negotiations were going with the fire department and that we were close to settling a contract.

1243
01:32:24,944 --> 01:32:25,625
That was clear, right?

1244
01:32:26,485 --> 01:32:27,265
That's what the mayor said?

1245
01:32:27,486 --> 01:32:27,726
Okay.

1246
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:29,227
Well, this is what the union says.

1247
01:32:29,247 --> 01:32:33,029
This could not be any further from the truth.

1248
01:32:34,241 --> 01:32:43,727
the city is proposing in their budget double digit percentage raises to their non-union employees while unions in the city go years without a contract.

1249
01:32:45,789 --> 01:32:53,554
We have new hires to this day who still do not have health insurance through the city of Medford because of administrative errors.

1250
01:32:54,514 --> 01:32:59,718
The mayor's office represented that everybody was covered and that this problem was resolved.

1251
01:33:05,437 --> 01:33:16,165
There's another thing in this letter that I'd like to point out, Madam President, and that's that in this budget that the mayor has proposed, they're cutting two more firefighter positions.

1252
01:33:17,106 --> 01:33:21,970
At the same time, the mayor is putting out press releases boasting how the city of Medford is one of the fastest growing communities in the country.

1253
01:33:25,313 --> 01:33:28,115
So we have a communication here from employees of this city.

1254
01:33:30,337 --> 01:33:32,258
I'd ask that they be included in the record, Madam President.

1255
01:33:32,879 --> 01:33:33,939
It was addressed to this council.

1256
01:33:35,250 --> 01:33:37,832
It's highlighting issues and concerns that were brought up at last week's meeting.

1257
01:33:39,053 --> 01:33:46,259
And it addresses certain things that were said, and I think that it should be included as part of the record and ask my council colleagues to support me and having this letter included as part of the record.

1258
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:49,502
Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1259
01:33:49,562 --> 01:33:59,030
All right, we have a motion from Councilor Knight to include this letter in the record seconded by Vice President Beyers.

1260
01:33:59,070 --> 01:34:01,192
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1261
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:07,381
Yes.

1262
01:34:07,481 --> 01:34:07,761
Yes.

1263
01:34:07,881 --> 01:34:08,221
Yes.

1264
01:34:09,122 --> 01:34:09,322
Yes.

1265
01:34:09,382 --> 01:34:10,962
Public participation.

1266
01:34:11,022 --> 01:34:16,764
And we have some folks here from the HR Commission would like to speak.

1267
01:34:36,785 --> 01:34:39,348
Hi, Milva McDonald, 61 Monument Street.

1268
01:34:39,748 --> 01:34:41,650
Thank you for allowing me to speak tonight.

1269
01:34:43,091 --> 01:34:45,334
I'm the chair of the Medford Charter Study Committee.

1270
01:34:45,834 --> 01:34:56,044
As you know, charter review has been discussed in Medford for many years, and we are at an exciting moment right now with volunteer residents undertaking the task.

1271
01:34:56,705 --> 01:34:57,206
As we work

1272
01:34:57,826 --> 01:35:06,717
with the Collins Center for Public Management, a nonprofit entity out of UMass Boston that has guided many communities through the process of charter review.

1273
01:35:07,278 --> 01:35:16,269
We are examining the charter as a whole and learning, among other things, about how pieces interact with each other, best practices, and trends.

1274
01:35:17,419 --> 01:35:25,042
The goal is to propose a sturdy, fair, transparent charter that provides a strong framework for our city government in the long term.

1275
01:35:26,563 --> 01:35:33,246
This holistic look at the charter is especially important in Medford because of how much time has passed since the last review.

1276
01:35:34,186 --> 01:35:41,750
As the blueprint for how our city government operates, the charter is a vitally important document that affects every person who lives in our city.

1277
01:35:42,845 --> 01:36:00,802
Now, for the first time in decades, we are finally giving it a checkup, looking at our form of government, the balance of powers, the composition of our elected bodies, length and limits of terms for elected officials, budget procedures, mechanisms for citizen participation, and more.

1278
01:36:02,003 --> 01:36:09,088
I have heard this council reiterate many times that charter review should come from the people, and that is exactly what is happening.

1279
01:36:09,789 --> 01:36:14,032
We are all residents who volunteered for this task because we care about our city.

1280
01:36:14,913 --> 01:36:18,335
Our process prioritizes community engagement and input.

1281
01:36:18,856 --> 01:36:23,079
We will use the public feedback we collect to draft a proposal

1282
01:36:23,519 --> 01:36:29,325
that must make its way through several portals, including this council, before ever becoming official.

1283
01:36:29,965 --> 01:36:33,028
The final step is at the ballot box with the voters.

1284
01:36:33,629 --> 01:36:36,372
The voters, the people, will have the final say.

1285
01:36:37,652 --> 01:36:47,661
Our webpage at www.medfordmad.org slash charter study has a wealth of information, including a form inviting public feedback.

1286
01:36:48,522 --> 01:36:53,866
You will find us at Circle the Square in June, the Farmer's Market in August, and other events around the city.

1287
01:36:54,605 --> 01:36:57,068
We will also be circulating a survey very soon.

1288
01:36:58,169 --> 01:37:00,892
But the main reason I'm here is to extend an invitation.

1289
01:37:01,392 --> 01:37:09,221
We are especially excited about our first public information and listening session this Thursday, June 8th at 7 p.m.

1290
01:37:09,541 --> 01:37:11,423
right here in City Hall Chambers.

1291
01:37:12,244 --> 01:37:14,467
All are welcome and encouraged to join us.

1292
01:37:14,967 --> 01:37:15,688
It's going to be fun.

1293
01:37:16,869 --> 01:37:20,552
regardless of which are events or meetings you can or cannot attend.

1294
01:37:21,092 --> 01:37:31,440
Your voice is important, and we want to hear from you, the residents of our city and the leaders of our city about your thoughts, hopes and dreams for our municipal government.

1295
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:34,542
We hope to see you on Thursday evening right here.

1296
01:37:35,002 --> 01:37:35,443
Thank you.

1297
01:37:36,423 --> 01:37:36,743
Thank you.

1298
01:37:42,287 --> 01:37:44,409
Anyone else wish to speak for public participation?

1299
01:37:45,767 --> 01:37:47,467
either in person or on Zoom.

1300
01:37:53,168 --> 01:38:02,770
I have a motion to take 22-514 the outdoor dining ordinance off the table and approve for third reading.

1301
01:38:03,050 --> 01:38:10,292
We have a motion to take 22-514 the outdoor dining ordinance off the table for approval for third reading.

1302
01:38:10,932 --> 01:38:11,532
Do I have a second?

1303
01:38:11,552 --> 01:38:12,732
Second.

1304
01:38:13,950 --> 01:38:14,950
Second by Councilor Collins.

1305
01:38:15,011 --> 01:38:17,932
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll to take it off the table.

1306
01:38:22,754 --> 01:38:23,894
Sorry?

1307
01:38:24,174 --> 01:38:25,075
Take it off the table and approve.

1308
01:38:25,115 --> 01:38:26,976
Okay, a motion to take off the table and approve.

1309
01:38:27,676 --> 01:38:41,842
For those following along, this is just a number of updates to our outdoor dining ordinance, a lot of it in work with our building commissioner, some safety, some modernization, and just making it also accessible and friendly for the business community.

1310
01:38:42,598 --> 01:38:45,779
So on the motion versus and bear second by Councillor Collins.

1311
01:38:46,800 --> 01:38:46,900
Yes.

1312
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:47,040
Yes.

1313
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:47,160
Yes.

1314
01:38:47,180 --> 01:38:47,400
Yes.

1315
01:38:47,420 --> 01:38:47,540
Yes.

1316
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:47,780
Yes.

1317
01:38:48,560 --> 01:38:48,741
Yes.

1318
01:38:48,801 --> 01:38:48,921
Yes.

1319
01:38:48,941 --> 01:38:49,241
Yes.

1320
01:38:49,661 --> 01:38:49,941
Yes.

1321
01:38:50,541 --> 01:38:54,543
The motion passes for third reading.

1322
01:38:55,083 --> 01:38:58,785
Motion from Councillor Knight to adjourn.

1323
01:38:58,805 --> 01:39:01,646
Seconded by vice affairs.

1324
01:39:12,861 --> 01:39:13,782
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1325
01:39:16,785 --> 01:39:16,925
Yes.
