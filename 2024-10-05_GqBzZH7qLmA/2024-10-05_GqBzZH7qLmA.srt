[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

57
00:02:11,893 --> 00:02:14,156
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I'm in the affirmative, so your motion passes.

58
00:02:14,276 --> 00:02:19,284
[SPEAKER_14]: I will go to Vice President Bears for a brief synopsis of the paper before us for this public hearing.

59
00:02:19,304 --> 00:02:20,205
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Bears.

60
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:21,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

61
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:25,673
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe this is the sixth public meeting we've now had on these items.

62
00:02:26,414 --> 00:02:36,498
[SPEAKER_02]: These are three amendments proposed to the city charter that with the approval of the council and the approval of the mayor would be submitted to the voters in November for their approval.

63
00:02:37,839 --> 00:02:48,203
[SPEAKER_02]: This first amendment would provide the city council with the authority to employ staff for research and legal consulting as needed.

64
00:02:49,764 --> 00:02:51,565
[SPEAKER_02]: The second one would

65
00:02:52,263 --> 00:03:02,252
[SPEAKER_02]: create a better budget plan and better budget process for the city of Medford by setting a formal date by which the mayor would be required to submit the annual budget.

66
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:19,443
[SPEAKER_02]: The City Council would also have a formal date by which it would have to approve or otherwise act on the mayor's budget proposal, and it would also allow the City Council to have a real role in the budget process by reallocating funds between line items.

67
00:03:19,523 --> 00:03:25,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, the City Council can only approve a whole budget, reject a whole budget, or cut specific line items.

68
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:28,448
[SPEAKER_02]: This would make the City Council a partner in the budget process.

69
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:33,259
[SPEAKER_02]: But the city council could not increase the budget above the mayor's proposal.

70
00:03:34,642 --> 00:03:38,050
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the three amendments of the third amendment sorry the third amendment would.

71
00:03:39,233 --> 00:03:48,557
[SPEAKER_02]: make appointees of the mayor to municipal boards, committees, and commissions created by city ordinance or by state law, subject to confirmation of the council.

72
00:03:48,577 --> 00:03:59,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, the city council does not confirm any nominees to the boards, committees, and commissions that are created by ordinance or state law, unless otherwise required by the ordinance or by state law.

73
00:04:00,563 --> 00:04:01,304
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the three.

74
00:04:01,744 --> 00:04:03,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't do the summary on the next two.

75
00:04:04,905 --> 00:04:06,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Save us some time on that.

76
00:04:06,466 --> 00:04:06,786
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

77
00:04:06,966 --> 00:04:12,487
[SPEAKER_14]: And I know there were some questions the last time for any amendments from legal counsel.

78
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:16,348
[SPEAKER_14]: Are those included in what is on the agenda or is that something you need to make on the floor?

79
00:04:16,408 --> 00:04:23,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the language reflects the motion from our May 9th meeting to incorporate the specific language changes from legal counsel.

80
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:34,892
[SPEAKER_02]: And those were also, those changes are also in our packets this past weekend as a red line copy and were also sent out to Councilors about a month ago when they came in from Attorney Goldberg.

81
00:04:36,868 --> 00:04:40,551
[SPEAKER_14]: So as this is a public hearing, I will take each, I will go to, sorry, we'll go to Councilor Collins.

82
00:04:41,591 --> 00:04:42,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Collins.

83
00:04:43,553 --> 00:04:44,353
[SPEAKER_12]: Apologies, President Brown.

84
00:04:44,394 --> 00:04:45,775
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm happy for you to open the meeting first.

85
00:04:49,157 --> 00:04:49,477
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

86
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:53,340
[SPEAKER_14]: So as this is a public hearing, I'll take these papers one by one.

87
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:54,201
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have paper 23-097.

88
00:04:55,221 --> 00:04:58,864
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is the appointments by city council.

89
00:05:00,797 --> 00:05:06,079
[SPEAKER_14]: enable the city council with many stipulations to secure legal services either by employment or on a contractual basis.

90
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:12,981
[SPEAKER_14]: Such legal services shall be solely in the service of the council and make good research analysis drafting drafting assistance.

91
00:05:16,382 --> 00:05:20,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Was it anyone who would like me to read the full proposed amendments?

92
00:05:20,523 --> 00:05:26,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so we'll open this portion of the public hearing if there is anyone who would like to speak in favor

93
00:05:27,233 --> 00:05:31,335
[SPEAKER_14]: of paper 23-097, either on Zoom or in person.

94
00:05:35,076 --> 00:05:37,497
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

95
00:05:38,198 --> 00:05:44,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of paper 23-097, either in person or on Zoom?

96
00:05:48,622 --> 00:05:51,903
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

97
00:05:53,824 --> 00:05:56,285
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further discussion from the council or do I have a motion?

98
00:05:58,597 --> 00:05:59,299
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to approve.

99
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,854
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll start going to Councilor Tseng.

100
00:06:06,194 --> 00:06:20,504
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be brief because we've held meetings on this, and I wanted to reiterate that we've done our very best to engage the public in a rigorous process with this.

101
00:06:21,164 --> 00:06:25,127
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that to members of the public, the item at hand is pretty clear.

102
00:06:27,729 --> 00:06:32,472
[SPEAKER_01]: I especially get that sense from emails that I've gotten from constituents,

103
00:06:33,973 --> 00:06:39,235
[SPEAKER_01]: We've asked for feedback with gauge support, and we've gotten a lot of feedback in support.

104
00:06:40,876 --> 00:06:46,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is an important vote, I wanted to quickly reiterate why I support this.

105
00:06:46,998 --> 00:06:50,419
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I think it allows for a framework of cooperation.

106
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:58,382
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the mayor said in our Tuesday meeting last week, that's a goal that we, that's something that we want to aspire to.

107
00:06:59,282 --> 00:07:00,023
[SPEAKER_01]: from both sides.

108
00:07:00,984 --> 00:07:03,186
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allows for that framework through good times and bad.

109
00:07:03,846 --> 00:07:06,389
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Berry said something that stuck with me.

110
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:12,314
[SPEAKER_01]: He said something along the lines of, we want to be writing the press releases with you guys, with the mayor.

111
00:07:13,315 --> 00:07:20,782
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just do believe that there's so much stronger of a message of political movement when we all work together.

112
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:25,044
[SPEAKER_01]: and compromise and work together to get to a place where we like on the issues.

113
00:07:25,865 --> 00:07:27,426
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not just about the positives.

114
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:48,958
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that these amendments allow us to shoulder the burden of governance together, to make difficult choices together, and to do so in a more public, transparent format where we can explain the choices that we make to our residents as well, which I think is gonna be important in the years coming up, especially with the fiscal cliff that we've all been talking about.

115
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:55,045
[SPEAKER_01]: What these amendments offer isn't that much different from what happens in other cities and other levels of government.

116
00:07:55,305 --> 00:07:56,687
[SPEAKER_01]: People expect us to work together.

117
00:07:56,907 --> 00:08:01,212
[SPEAKER_01]: They expect the legislative branch to have a role in these things.

118
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:06,459
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are actually just confused why we don't do these things the way that we're proposing already.

119
00:08:09,802 --> 00:08:13,323
[SPEAKER_01]: I see that in the survey results for the budget survey that I put out.

120
00:08:14,443 --> 00:08:16,723
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that these amendments allow us to do our job.

121
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:19,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Residents expect legislators to legislate.

122
00:08:19,744 --> 00:08:23,424
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the central mission of our job and it's in the name.

123
00:08:23,524 --> 00:08:34,406
[SPEAKER_01]: To all the residents who wonder why we don't move faster on issues, I believe while a lot of it is a need for process, a lot of it is also the lack of staff and researchers that we have.

124
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:37,067
[SPEAKER_01]: These amendments allow us to

125
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,669
[SPEAKER_01]: make it help us to help you.

126
00:08:40,509 --> 00:08:41,951
[SPEAKER_01]: They help us to do our job.

127
00:08:42,532 --> 00:08:45,154
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that these amendments I'm going to close off here.

128
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:52,842
[SPEAKER_01]: But by saying that, I think these amendments allow us to plan and longer term and increase transparency, it moves up the calendar.

129
00:08:54,684 --> 00:09:01,768
[SPEAKER_01]: and I know that this is a stated goal of everyone on the city council and the mayor said that as well.

130
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:06,431
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a prime example is in soliciting feedback from residents this time.

131
00:09:07,051 --> 00:09:08,592
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I have really

132
00:09:09,773 --> 00:09:15,039
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've all talked about after school child care before on the council, but it is something that we need to tackle as a city.

133
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:27,412
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we were able to engage residents at an earlier time, and we had more of a public facing process where the legislative could help the executive do that too, we would be able to

134
00:09:28,092 --> 00:09:30,794
[SPEAKER_01]: find a way to address it or start to address it in the budget.

135
00:09:31,214 --> 00:09:36,057
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think, you know, there are literally litany of reasons why I think everyone should support these amendments.

136
00:09:36,277 --> 00:09:44,823
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think Councilor Bears for all the work that he's put into this, I think the rest of the council for being so patient and for for entertaining these ideas.

137
00:09:46,664 --> 00:09:47,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

138
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:51,678
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Morell.

139
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:56,703
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm excited that we've gotten to the point tonight where we get to vote on these.

140
00:09:56,723 --> 00:10:08,174
[SPEAKER_12]: I thank Vice President Bears for noting that this is the sixth time that we've been able to meet and discuss these in public meetings so far this year and have the floor open for public comment and questions.

141
00:10:08,934 --> 00:10:15,160
[SPEAKER_12]: But at the same time, you know, I want to reinforce for folks who are watching this meeting that this is the beginning of a process, not the end.

142
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:23,987
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, should these pass, this would be no different from putting, for example, a debt exclusion on the ballot or putting a CPA amendment on the ballot, as was done several years ago.

143
00:10:24,668 --> 00:10:30,613
[SPEAKER_12]: This leads it up to the voters to continue to discuss and consider and then place individual

144
00:10:31,313 --> 00:10:33,115
[SPEAKER_12]: votes on these individual amendments.

145
00:10:33,995 --> 00:10:41,222
[SPEAKER_12]: I've said this before, but just to reiterate, you know, I think that these amendments would be additive for this whole community.

146
00:10:41,522 --> 00:10:51,610
[SPEAKER_12]: Administrations change, but we always deserve a council that is truly empowered to represent our community members and act on their behalf, not just be a grandstanding body, not just be a rubber stamp.

147
00:10:53,451 --> 00:11:00,454
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, this council can't appropriate resources to ensure that the policies we do pass actually get enforced or if they are just left to gather dust.

148
00:11:01,114 --> 00:11:06,356
[SPEAKER_12]: We can't hire staff to allow us to do our work confidently or effectively or with the resources that we need.

149
00:11:06,937 --> 00:11:12,419
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not empowered to really collaborate with the administration to craft budgets that reflect what we hear from our constituents.

150
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:17,661
[SPEAKER_12]: So to me, these are important because these amendments would leave the community with seven more avenues.

151
00:11:18,301 --> 00:11:21,845
[SPEAKER_12]: for meaningful representation in their city government, and that's really what it comes down to.

152
00:11:22,806 --> 00:11:27,370
[SPEAKER_12]: The community's representatives should be able to actually materially represent them.

153
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:29,192
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is about

154
00:11:30,413 --> 00:11:37,258
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, just making some important targeted tweaks to our 40-year-old charter so that we can start working for a better community now.

155
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:46,064
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I think that the work we have to do, the work that we've been trying to do, will be done better and faster with these amendments with a more balanced and collaborative government.

156
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:52,028
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't think that that can wait, you know, half a decade or more to be able to work more effectively for the constituents.

157
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:52,509
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

158
00:11:52,529 --> 00:11:55,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Collins.

159
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,952
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further discussion from the Council?

160
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:06,805
[SPEAKER_14]: And just to reiterate, just so people, as Councilor Collins said, to make clear on the process, an affirmative vote from the council would result in this going to the mayor's desk.

161
00:12:06,825 --> 00:12:08,866
[SPEAKER_14]: It would then have to be approved by the mayor.

162
00:12:08,886 --> 00:12:15,369
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be then vetted by the attorney general to then appear on the November ballot to be voted on by the voters.

163
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:16,850
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's the process.

164
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:19,792
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is, as Councilor Collins says, this is a step in the process.

165
00:12:19,812 --> 00:12:22,593
[SPEAKER_14]: And if this is voted in the affirmative, nothing would change tonight.

166
00:12:22,633 --> 00:12:27,556
[SPEAKER_14]: It just moves it on to the mayor's desk, then to the AG if she votes affirmative, and then to the voters.

167
00:12:28,292 --> 00:12:31,394
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a motion from vicers and pairs to approve 23-097.

168
00:12:31,414 --> 00:12:40,920
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, this is appointments by the city council with regards to securing legal services either by employment or on a contractual basis.

169
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:42,501
[SPEAKER_14]: Do I have a second?

170
00:12:43,642 --> 00:12:44,662
[SPEAKER_14]: Second.

171
00:12:45,383 --> 00:12:46,523
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

172
00:12:48,485 --> 00:12:51,246
[SPEAKER_14]: And do you want to wait the public comment period?

173
00:12:52,527 --> 00:12:52,687
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

174
00:12:52,727 --> 00:12:52,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

175
00:12:55,727 --> 00:12:59,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Madam President, I'd advise against it on a matter that's as significant as enough as our charter.

176
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:01,850
[SPEAKER_14]: Advise against?

177
00:13:02,271 --> 00:13:03,291
[SPEAKER_06]: Waving the comment.

178
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:05,633
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, we'll keep the, okay.

179
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:09,435
[SPEAKER_14]: So motion to approve pending the six-day public comment period.

180
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Bears.

181
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:20,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

182
00:13:21,682 --> 00:13:22,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

183
00:13:22,262 --> 00:13:22,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

184
00:13:22,482 --> 00:13:23,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins.

185
00:13:26,808 --> 00:13:33,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, no, I mean, no, no, no, no.

186
00:13:33,371 --> 00:13:33,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

187
00:13:35,952 --> 00:13:36,192
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

188
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:41,714
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, six in the affirmative one in the negative emotion passes.

189
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,715
[SPEAKER_14]: Going to 23-098.

190
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:50,913
[SPEAKER_14]: notice of a public hearing.

191
00:13:50,933 --> 00:13:58,397
[SPEAKER_14]: The Medford City Council will hold a continued public hearing on the motion of Vice President Bears to waive the reading.

192
00:13:59,678 --> 00:14:02,459
[SPEAKER_14]: As we've already gotten a brief summary, so we'll waive the reading.

193
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:15,906
[SPEAKER_14]: I will say that this paper is about the creation and approval of the municipal budget, and generally the mayor and city council of the city of Medford shall each have a role in the budget process, including the power to modify in whole or in part an appropriation order

194
00:14:16,396 --> 00:14:26,580
[SPEAKER_14]: or an item within the total amount of any appropriation order, clarify budgetary procedures, and take such other actions as are necessary to amend, approve, or disapprove the annual budget for the city.

195
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:35,003
[SPEAKER_14]: Notwithstanding the first sentence of this section, however, the mayor shall have inclusive authority to originate an appropriation order, and it goes on for four more paragraphs.

196
00:14:35,623 --> 00:14:38,484
[SPEAKER_14]: So I will open up the public hearing.

197
00:14:39,024 --> 00:14:45,447
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there anyone who would like to speak in favor of 23-098, creation and approval of a municipal budget?

198
00:14:46,555 --> 00:14:47,936
[SPEAKER_14]: either on Zoom or in person.

199
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,659
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

200
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:59,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of the paper before us, either on Zoom or in person?

201
00:15:01,604 --> 00:15:04,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing none, this portion of the public hearing is closed.

202
00:15:05,714 --> 00:15:06,414
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Bears.

203
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:07,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

204
00:15:07,475 --> 00:15:16,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd just like to note that I've received at least 30 emails in the last three days supporting this paper among other budget requests, and I would move to approve.

205
00:15:16,518 --> 00:15:21,499
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a motion from Vice President Bears.

206
00:15:23,727 --> 00:15:27,128
[SPEAKER_14]: to approve pending the six-day power period, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

207
00:15:27,168 --> 00:15:37,731
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, this paper would follow the exact same process I outlined before, an approval by the council, sent to the mayor's desk, it would have to be vetted by the AG if she approves it, and then to the voters in November.

208
00:15:38,211 --> 00:15:42,552
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of vices and fairs, as seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

209
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Ferris.

237
00:17:19,517 --> 00:17:26,618
[SPEAKER_14]: and assessors, if elected by a vote of the people, for whom no other method of appointment or selection is provided by city ordinance or general laws.

238
00:17:27,158 --> 00:17:31,799
[SPEAKER_14]: All members of municipal boards, committees, and commissions shall serve terms as defined by city ordinance and general laws.

239
00:17:31,939 --> 00:17:35,340
[SPEAKER_14]: All heads of departments shall be appointed by the mayor without confirmation of city council.

240
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,680

00:18:08,227 --> 00:18:09,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Do I have a motion?

249
00:18:09,628 --> 00:18:12,250

00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:30,339
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, just to reiterate one last time, this approval by the council would set this to the mayor's desk.

254
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:36,461
[SPEAKER_14]: If the mayor were to approve it, it would have to go to the attorney general and then appear before the voters in November.

255
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:40,442
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of Vice President Bears as seconded by Councilor Collins.

285
00:21:07,872 --> 00:21:09,792
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to feel to operate illegal.

286
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:13,673
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I could have until midnight, nothing's going to change.

287
00:21:13,753 --> 00:21:17,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Our hours are going to stay the same during the week and Friday and Saturday.

288
00:21:18,074 --> 00:21:22,255
[SPEAKER_00]: We have this license for 22 years, the common vehicle license until 11.

289
00:21:22,655 --> 00:21:24,295
[SPEAKER_00]: So 11 is going to close anyway.

290
00:21:24,755 --> 00:21:27,016
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted to have the ability so people can stay in there.

291
00:21:27,316 --> 00:21:36,778
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a large group of people, if it's a small group, I'd rather to close and all my servers go home and my cooks go home.

292
00:21:37,378 --> 00:21:37,699
[SPEAKER_00]: and the

293
00:21:53,735 --> 00:21:55,076
[SPEAKER_03]: If I can, I thank you.

294
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:57,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that we've been getting messages back and forth.

295
00:21:57,578 --> 00:22:01,101
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the reason why I asked for the extension.

296
00:22:01,341 --> 00:22:03,383
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate you working with the neighbors.

297
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:04,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we know.

298
00:22:04,244 --> 00:22:10,129
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the neighbors are very happy with the the rules that you're putting in place your employees.

299
00:22:10,169 --> 00:22:11,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's very important.

300
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,432
[SPEAKER_03]: But so let's just so we can move forward.

301
00:22:13,472 --> 00:22:20,598
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're asking for the extended hours until 12 o'clock just for Fridays and Saturdays and Wednesday night and Wednesday night special

302
00:22:21,438 --> 00:22:28,708
[SPEAKER_00]: that we advertised, but we had a good meeting with the neighbors, and they're happy the way we talked.

303
00:22:28,788 --> 00:22:30,810
[SPEAKER_03]: This is exactly what I was hoping for.

304
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:37,639
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we're looking at the conversation we had back and forth with both everybody talking in favor for you and

305
00:22:39,111 --> 00:22:43,033
[SPEAKER_03]: the respect that you have for the neighbors, the neighbors they have for you, my friend.

306
00:22:43,674 --> 00:22:51,039
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would, I know we still have to move forward, but so to be clear, it's Wednesday, Fridays, and Saturdays until 12 o'clock.

307
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:51,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

308
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,621
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome, thank you.

309
00:22:53,041 --> 00:22:55,443
[SPEAKER_14]: And then did you have specific questions for Attorney Austin?

310
00:22:55,903 --> 00:23:01,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what the question was, if it was going to be, you know, if we were gonna deny it,

311
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:06,132
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in what grounds do we have to deny the special permit?

312
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:21,263
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that with this resolution, I know we'll hear from the residents, but if we don't see any conflicts, I appreciate the council for being here, but we wouldn't need their involvement because that answer would be new.

313
00:23:21,624 --> 00:23:22,104
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

314
00:23:22,604 --> 00:23:25,907
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, and as this is a public hearing, I have to take comments in a specific order.

315
00:23:25,927 --> 00:23:27,909
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to take comments.

316
00:23:29,029 --> 00:23:31,511
[SPEAKER_14]: in favor of the paper first, if there's, I'll open up.

317
00:23:31,531 --> 00:23:32,472
[SPEAKER_14]: How do you know what I'm gonna say?

318
00:23:33,052 --> 00:23:34,193
[SPEAKER_14]: You don't know if they're in favor or opposed?

319
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:34,693
[SPEAKER_03]: You in favor?

320
00:23:34,713 --> 00:23:35,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

321
00:23:35,354 --> 00:23:35,494
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

322
00:23:35,534 --> 00:23:35,754
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

323
00:23:35,954 --> 00:23:39,237
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's just because it's a specific order for this type of hearing.

324
00:23:39,337 --> 00:23:40,918
[SPEAKER_11]: So name and address.

325
00:23:41,018 --> 00:23:46,823
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm Louise D'Antonio, 41 Dartmouth Street, which is perpendicular to Yale Street, and I've grown up in that neighborhood.

326
00:23:47,403 --> 00:23:48,765
[SPEAKER_11]: I wanted to report on the meeting.

327
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:56,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Despite what some people may have thought, we had a very vigorous, respectful meeting,

328
00:23:58,317 --> 00:24:05,078
[SPEAKER_11]: All people at the meeting, including the mayor's representative from the Portuguese Brazilian council was present.

329
00:24:06,038 --> 00:24:12,060
[SPEAKER_11]: We were able to express our ideas, our thoughts, our concerns without being held back.

330
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:16,280
[SPEAKER_11]: And it was a very honest, productive meeting.

331
00:24:18,441 --> 00:24:24,742
[SPEAKER_11]: We spoke about the hours, but one of the things that we all agreed upon was that

332
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:35,167
[SPEAKER_11]: That area between 1130 and one o'clock, 1.30 in the afternoon has very little enforcement, parking enforcement.

333
00:24:35,627 --> 00:24:44,529
[SPEAKER_11]: We also both agree that there has to be more enforcement in the evening in the parking lot at those late hours.

334
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:46,390
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to try to make

335
00:24:47,969 --> 00:24:51,070
[SPEAKER_11]: some contact with the police department or something.

336
00:24:51,550 --> 00:25:02,433
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how many cars are available, but if you have a problem in a specific area at a specific time, that's when you send people down there.

337
00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:10,635
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't wait until two hours later, drive down the street, see that there are no cars there, and then say, well, what's the problem?

338
00:25:11,715 --> 00:25:13,175
[SPEAKER_11]: So... Ms.

339
00:25:13,195 --> 00:25:16,096
[SPEAKER_03]: D'Antonio, if I can, I know I asked for

340
00:25:17,246 --> 00:25:37,745
[SPEAKER_03]: for this meeting specifically because I didn't think that this was just the issue with just with oasis I think the enforcement was big so I recommended that we had legal counsel here, the police chief, the DPW traffic commission, I mean the traffic director as anybody else here.

341
00:25:39,732 --> 00:25:41,492
[SPEAKER_03]: We should, I think we asked for the parking director also.

342
00:25:41,652 --> 00:25:43,013
[SPEAKER_03]: And the parking director.

343
00:25:43,073 --> 00:25:45,513
[SPEAKER_14]: We have the building commissioner here.

344
00:25:45,573 --> 00:25:46,193
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not see.

345
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:48,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the building, but really is really having.

346
00:25:48,794 --> 00:25:49,754
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's important.

347
00:25:49,814 --> 00:25:54,475
[SPEAKER_11]: One of the things I wanted to mention, we have no disagreement with the restaurants.

348
00:25:55,035 --> 00:25:55,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Not at all.

349
00:25:56,275 --> 00:26:02,976
[SPEAKER_11]: But a year ago, some residents in another part of the city complained about not being able to park on their street.

350
00:26:04,076 --> 00:26:07,497
[SPEAKER_11]: And then within a week, there were signs and barriers.

351
00:26:08,532 --> 00:26:13,645
[SPEAKER_11]: Now that's a different section of the city, but they got a response very quickly.

352
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:16,433
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for asking for that meeting.

353
00:26:18,055 --> 00:26:18,895
[SPEAKER_11]: I look forward to that.

354
00:26:19,036 --> 00:26:21,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, I'm a little disappointed because we asked him to come tonight.

355
00:26:21,877 --> 00:26:28,881
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was one of the reasons wasn't just, it wasn't just the community members and the business owners to talk and glad you did.

356
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:38,186
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other reason why we call this because it was concerns of other issues that I think the enforcement was bringing in the negativity of the business owners

357
00:26:38,706 --> 00:26:56,586
[SPEAKER_03]: where we have to make sure that there's a plan in place, whether it's signage, whether we talk to the traffic commission, and do residents only from certain times or set up, you know, patrols in the parking lot area, and around the same time is the closing of the establishment.

358
00:26:56,606 --> 00:26:59,209
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is the these are the questions I wanted to ask

359
00:26:59,809 --> 00:27:03,371
[SPEAKER_03]: the the departments that are relevant to get us.

360
00:27:03,491 --> 00:27:04,211
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.

361
00:27:04,251 --> 00:27:06,092
[SPEAKER_11]: But the thing is, you can have a lot of signs.

362
00:27:06,132 --> 00:27:08,954
[SPEAKER_11]: But if there's no enforcement, I don't science science.

363
00:27:09,234 --> 00:27:10,415
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you for your time.

364
00:27:10,475 --> 00:27:10,915
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

365
00:27:10,995 --> 00:27:11,495
[SPEAKER_11]: Appreciate it.

366
00:27:11,815 --> 00:27:12,216
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

367
00:27:12,396 --> 00:27:15,437
[SPEAKER_14]: And just the resolution we had was just about legal counsel.

368
00:27:15,457 --> 00:27:18,059
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you may have mentioned that but they didn't put it in.

369
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:20,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I think that'll be something we'll have to follow through.

370
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:21,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I think for the neighbors.

371
00:27:22,461 --> 00:27:27,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the feedback that I got back from the neighbors was that, you know, really, is

372
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:45,937
[SPEAKER_03]: is giving South Method the respect that they deserve and the residents there that they deserve, and making sure that there's some sort of a plan that the administration can work with the traffic department, the chief of police, and making sure that they step up dedicated patrols if that's what's needed in the evenings.

373
00:27:45,977 --> 00:27:52,742
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think the piece that bothered me the most, the phone calls that I got, were the elderly neighbors that said that, you know,

374
00:27:53,482 --> 00:27:55,244
[SPEAKER_03]: the blocking of the driveways.

375
00:27:55,964 --> 00:28:01,589
[SPEAKER_03]: And to say that it was Oasis's fault, I didn't believe that.

376
00:28:01,689 --> 00:28:05,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the issue really is having the

377
00:28:08,197 --> 00:28:08,777
[SPEAKER_03]: enforcement.

378
00:28:09,077 --> 00:28:12,839
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that we need to, you know, I know it's not a popular thing to do.

379
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:21,402
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you throw a few tickets on a few cars, and somebody gets told because a senior citizen can't back up out of the driveway for an emergency reason.

380
00:28:21,842 --> 00:28:30,446
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's more important to me than any anybody's uncomfortable situation of going to get their their automobile out of impound because they didn't park and

381
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:32,527
[SPEAKER_03]: a reasonable area.

382
00:28:32,547 --> 00:28:42,855
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's something down the line we need to really call for a meeting, whether it be a committee of the whole or subcommittee on public safety, and really bring the neighbors back out.

383
00:28:42,995 --> 00:28:44,036
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, Madam President.

384
00:28:44,636 --> 00:28:44,937
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

385
00:28:45,717 --> 00:28:48,479
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of the petition?

386
00:28:48,499 --> 00:28:52,703
[SPEAKER_14]: And that would be the owners if you want to speak in favor once more, if you want to just come up.

387
00:28:53,583 --> 00:28:54,224
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're in favor?

388
00:28:54,704 --> 00:28:55,065
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

389
00:28:56,666 --> 00:28:57,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyone else who would like to speak in favor?

390
00:28:59,792 --> 00:29:04,834
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing none, is there anyone else, anyone who would like to speak in opposition of the petition before us?

391
00:29:05,954 --> 00:29:06,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Please come up to the podium.

392
00:29:08,816 --> 00:29:15,098
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi, my name is David Perella.

393
00:29:15,798 --> 00:29:17,339
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm at 16 Yale Street.

394
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:22,101
[SPEAKER_13]: I would just like to go on record that I do oppose this.

395
00:29:24,862 --> 00:29:27,583
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do think, so I've heard before that

396
00:29:28,571 --> 00:29:32,032
[SPEAKER_13]: you can't come up with a reason why you would deny this.

397
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:34,152
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I can give you one reason.

398
00:29:34,172 --> 00:29:39,313
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you have an obligation to protect the quality of life of the residents.

399
00:29:41,394 --> 00:29:42,394
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's that simple.

400
00:29:42,414 --> 00:29:48,035
[SPEAKER_13]: So I simply wanna go on record saying I do not support this and I hope that you will reconsider.

401
00:29:48,055 --> 00:29:50,096
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

402
00:29:50,416 --> 00:29:50,796
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

403
00:29:50,816 --> 00:29:54,937
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there anyone else who would like to speak in opposition either on Zoom or in person?

404
00:29:58,851 --> 00:30:02,916
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing none portion of the public hearing is closed any further discussion from the council.

405
00:30:04,858 --> 00:30:05,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello.

406
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:06,900
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

407
00:30:07,861 --> 00:30:17,371
[SPEAKER_15]: I would hope that I wasn't in on some of the meetings but I would hope that in the restaurant they will put some signs up for the customers to respect the neighborhood.

408
00:30:18,538 --> 00:30:20,940
[SPEAKER_03]: That's part of the discussion.

409
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:29,428
[SPEAKER_03]: The part of the discussion with the owners, we're going to place signs not only in the facility, but also as they walk around toward the public parking area.

410
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:36,514
[SPEAKER_03]: And I believe it's going to be in a few different languages, just for our Portuguese speaking patrons.

411
00:30:36,554 --> 00:30:37,595
[SPEAKER_03]: So we appreciate that.

412
00:30:37,615 --> 00:30:42,320
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's the, you know, and I appreciate that the general came up and talked about, you know.

413
00:30:44,329 --> 00:30:49,694
[SPEAKER_15]: And maybe we should notify the other restaurants that are in that block also about what's happening.

414
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:51,296
[SPEAKER_15]: He's not the only one there.

415
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:51,836
[SPEAKER_15]: I agree.

416
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:53,578
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that we should ask you.

417
00:30:53,658 --> 00:30:54,959
[SPEAKER_15]: There's two other restaurants there.

418
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,461
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe you should be notified also.

419
00:30:57,317 --> 00:30:58,378
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe community development?

420
00:30:58,578 --> 00:30:58,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

421
00:30:59,118 --> 00:30:59,799
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good idea.

422
00:30:59,819 --> 00:30:59,919
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

423
00:31:00,259 --> 00:31:05,423
[SPEAKER_03]: To reach out to Bocelli's and I think Mace Cafe stays open a little later.

424
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:20,575
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe reaching out to them, form a motion that maybe that the liaison to the businesses can reach out and see what they can do to make sure that they can post some signage or, you know, for their patrons to also respect that neighborhood.

425
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:21,736
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you want to make that a B paper?

426
00:31:21,936 --> 00:31:22,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you please?

427
00:31:22,397 --> 00:31:22,937
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

428
00:31:23,938 --> 00:31:25,899
[SPEAKER_14]: So do you have that language, Mr. Clerk?

429
00:31:38,174 --> 00:31:47,777
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a B paper from Councilor Scarpelli to ask community development to reach out with signage for all of the restaurants in the area that utilize that parking lot.

430
00:31:48,777 --> 00:31:50,278
[SPEAKER_14]: Do I have a second for that B paper?

431
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:54,779
[SPEAKER_14]: That's right.

432
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:55,980
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll take the B paper first.

433
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:01,301
[SPEAKER_14]: So on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

434
00:32:01,321 --> 00:32:03,042
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is for the B paper, not the main petition.

459
00:33:49,762 --> 00:33:52,183
[SPEAKER_14]: Want to tell us a little bit about the business.

460
00:33:52,223 --> 00:33:54,784
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we're all familiar with Subway, but do you want to just tell us what you're seeking?

461
00:33:55,864 --> 00:33:59,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's a fast food restaurant.

462
00:33:59,546 --> 00:34:05,228
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been doing this one for close to 10 years now.

463
00:34:05,728 --> 00:34:09,609
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have multiple locations.

464
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:12,630
[SPEAKER_10]: And this one, we just started.

465
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:15,791
[SPEAKER_10]: We took over from the previous owner.

466
00:34:16,091 --> 00:34:17,032
[SPEAKER_10]: They're running the business.

467
00:34:18,072 --> 00:34:19,653
[SPEAKER_10]: and we just took over this one.

468
00:34:19,673 --> 00:34:20,894
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's nothing changed.

469
00:34:21,014 --> 00:34:22,594
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything's going to be the same as it is.

470
00:34:22,614 --> 00:34:23,455
[SPEAKER_10]: The hours are the same.

471
00:34:23,755 --> 00:34:25,856
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not extended, correct, because that goes with the owner.

472
00:34:25,876 --> 00:34:29,918
[SPEAKER_03]: So all this is just changing of ownership from one subway.

473
00:34:30,158 --> 00:34:30,358
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

474
00:34:30,598 --> 00:34:30,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

475
00:34:30,778 --> 00:34:31,939

476
00:34:32,259 --> 00:34:32,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

477
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:32,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

478
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:35,621
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is that you have only five employees that work for you?

479
00:34:36,782 --> 00:34:38,744
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's like a few part timer.

480
00:34:38,964 --> 00:34:39,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

481
00:34:39,164 --> 00:34:42,287
[SPEAKER_10]: And, like, you know, one is a free time.

482
00:34:42,407 --> 00:34:45,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, it's probably just what I just said.

483
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:46,652
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm sorry, Mr. So many mistakes.

484
00:34:46,832 --> 00:34:47,793
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I apologize.

485
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:49,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Are we still going to honor the $5 for one.

486
00:34:57,703 --> 00:35:06,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam President, I see everything in order, all paperwork's in order, so I would move approval after my colleagues have any comments.

487
00:35:06,647 --> 00:35:07,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

488
00:35:07,667 --> 00:35:09,148
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further discussion from the council?

489
00:35:09,428 --> 00:35:13,289
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing none, so on the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

490
00:35:13,369 --> 00:35:14,490

493
00:35:17,171 --> 00:35:17,731
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

494
00:35:17,771 --> 00:35:18,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

495
00:35:18,371 --> 00:35:18,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins.

496
00:35:19,632 --> 00:35:19,892
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

497
00:35:20,832 --> 00:35:21,273

499
00:35:22,193 --> 00:35:22,913
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

500
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:23,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

501
00:35:23,734 --> 00:35:24,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng.

502
00:35:26,795 --> 00:35:26,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

503
00:35:29,316 --> 00:35:32,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, seven the affirmative zero negative the motion passes.

504
00:35:32,118 --> 00:35:32,918
[SPEAKER_14]: Congratulations.

505
00:35:32,958 --> 00:35:34,580
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for being here so long.

506
00:35:36,281 --> 00:35:41,605
[SPEAKER_14]: Going to motions, orders and resolutions 23-313 offered by vice and bears.

507
00:35:42,185 --> 00:35:54,014
[SPEAKER_14]: He is so resolved by the Metro City Council that the subcommittee on ordinances and rules need to consider an ordinance establishing a municipal compensation advisory board to consistently study the adequacy of compensation of all municipal officials

508
00:35:54,485 --> 00:36:01,611
[SPEAKER_14]: and employees and create a report on a regular basis that is kept on file for the benefit of the public and the city's elected officials, vices and affairs.

509
00:36:01,851 --> 00:36:15,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President, I'll be brief as I think this is relatively self explanatory, but something that we've been asking for, and it hasn't come to fruition yet, although our new HR director said they are working on it as a classification and compensation study.

510
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:34,784
[SPEAKER_02]: This would actually create something that exists in several other communities, which is an advisory board to conduct such a study regularly and provide regular updates to make sure that the salaries offered to all municipal employees are competitive.

511
00:36:34,864 --> 00:36:39,467
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would move to refer this to the subcommittee on ordinances and rules for further discussion.

512
00:36:40,008 --> 00:36:42,470
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further discussion by the council?

513
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:47,318
[SPEAKER_14]: On the motion of vice-president Bears, seconded by Councilor Knight.

514
00:36:47,398 --> 00:36:48,419
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

515
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:58,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice-president Bears.

516
00:36:58,407 --> 00:36:58,667
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

517
00:36:59,387 --> 00:37:00,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

518
00:37:00,188 --> 00:37:00,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

519
00:37:01,109 --> 00:37:01,749
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins.

520
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:02,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

521
00:37:02,570 --> 00:37:04,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

522
00:37:04,191 --> 00:37:04,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

523
00:37:04,771 --> 00:37:05,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpello.

524
00:37:05,752 --> 00:37:06,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

525
00:37:06,373 --> 00:37:06,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Santa.

526
00:37:07,473 --> 00:37:07,714
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

527
00:37:09,035 --> 00:37:09,555
[SPEAKER_04]: President Raul.

528
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:10,236
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

529
00:37:10,356 --> 00:37:12,697
[SPEAKER_14]: Seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

530
00:37:14,435 --> 00:37:24,243
[SPEAKER_14]: 23-three one four offer by Councilor Scarpelli be it so resolved the Metro City Council invite residents and the city engineer to speak with the city council regarding safety issues when it comes to private ways Councilor Scarpelli.

531
00:37:24,623 --> 00:37:25,424
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Madam President.

532
00:37:25,964 --> 00:37:36,212
[SPEAKER_03]: This came about when the resident came to us who's been on the list, who lives in a private way who who's lived there for a long time in the city.

533
00:37:37,032 --> 00:38:00,452
[SPEAKER_03]: she planted a tree, a rooting tree in front of her establishment, her home, and she sat on the list for three years and was informed by a city engineer, I believe, and I was hoping he was here, but obviously he's not, that the city engineer has now followed through with the hard line, which is a law that the city does not maintain private ways.

534
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:09,001
[SPEAKER_03]: I will tell you I received many phone calls concerning public safety when it comes to these decisions.

535
00:38:10,082 --> 00:38:16,484
[SPEAKER_03]: We can understand when it comes to doing these bigger projects and understand our rules and regulations when it comes to private ways.

536
00:38:17,084 --> 00:38:30,210
[SPEAKER_03]: We understand that one of the biggest reasons that we don't receive enough funding from the state or the federal government is because Medford has, what people don't realize, an abundance of private ways.

537
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:35,993
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really hurts our bottom line when it comes to road work in our community.

538
00:38:36,593 --> 00:38:44,477
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you talk to most people that own homes on private ways, they have a lot of pride and they maintain their homes.

539
00:38:44,658 --> 00:38:55,323
[SPEAKER_03]: And this one person who has a very dangerous lip now because of a rooting tree and has been on this list, had now been told that this would not work.

540
00:38:55,404 --> 00:38:57,545
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need to clarify this because

541
00:38:59,087 --> 00:39:04,731
[SPEAKER_03]: The truth of the matter is, if someone does still trip and fall, the burden falls back on who?

542
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:06,232
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the resident.

543
00:39:07,132 --> 00:39:11,115
[SPEAKER_03]: It comes back to this council and the city and legal action.

544
00:39:11,735 --> 00:39:15,998
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you see those suits that we've had in the past, 3,500, 5,500, these all add up to a pretty good number.

545
00:39:16,018 --> 00:39:17,299
[SPEAKER_03]: But more importantly,

546
00:39:24,757 --> 00:39:32,284
[SPEAKER_03]: I fear that it's going to be that elderly person that walks down that private way, smashes their head and God forbid passes.

547
00:39:33,145 --> 00:39:42,493
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this is something that to just be passive about changing this rule as a new new city engineer, and

548
00:39:43,191 --> 00:39:53,966
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wish he was here because I'd like to ask him some questions that the residents that did reach out to him from what I've been told was that it was very arrogant in his presentation.

549
00:39:54,727 --> 00:39:59,875
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me as a city employee, municipal employee, that person works for the residents of the city.

550
00:40:00,885 --> 00:40:02,646
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's the biggest piece.

551
00:40:02,686 --> 00:40:17,912
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that we need to have guidelines set by this administration, really informing the people in the private ways of these rule changes or not to rule changes, but the the the persistence of following those rules now.

552
00:40:18,832 --> 00:40:21,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I got a phone call from another resident.

553
00:40:21,733 --> 00:40:25,655
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, Well, George, we live over here near Arthur Winthrop Street.

554
00:40:26,342 --> 00:40:34,124
[SPEAKER_03]: My neighbors and I, three years ago, followed the rule and we brought in a hot top company because the street was deplorable.

555
00:40:34,764 --> 00:40:42,786
[SPEAKER_03]: And they talked to these professionals and said, because this isn't a major way, you should use this type of top, this type of patch.

556
00:40:43,386 --> 00:40:46,047
[SPEAKER_03]: They repaved the whole street on their dime.

557
00:40:46,947 --> 00:40:47,567
[SPEAKER_03]: They did it right.

558
00:40:48,508 --> 00:40:53,589
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they're upset now because during the Winthrop Street project,

559
00:40:54,925 --> 00:40:58,787
[SPEAKER_03]: The city diverted all of the traffic where?

560
00:40:59,788 --> 00:41:01,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Through this private way.

561
00:41:02,009 --> 00:41:12,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, because of the hot top that was laid, because of the trucks that drove down that road consistently, their street is now in disarray.

562
00:41:13,316 --> 00:41:24,243
[SPEAKER_03]: So their question that I wanted to ask the city engineer, if this is the case, what fair is fair, is the city now liable for repaving that street?

563
00:41:25,751 --> 00:41:28,972
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a logical point.

564
00:41:29,773 --> 00:41:35,475
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, when you're not talking, you're not communicating with your residents, this is a huge concern.

565
00:41:36,655 --> 00:41:38,616
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the things that are open-ended.

566
00:41:38,636 --> 00:41:54,703
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would make the motion that we ask the city administration to please set up guidelines to re-educate our constituents on the follow through now of our new engineer and the policies that they're now following through or not following through.

567
00:41:55,852 --> 00:42:08,987
[SPEAKER_03]: and the fact that what if the city is diverting the public traffic into their private ways and destroying these roadways that have just been paved?

568
00:42:09,788 --> 00:42:13,432
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like to get these answered for these constituents because

569
00:42:15,224 --> 00:42:20,892
[SPEAKER_03]: The next step is they said they would come here and the eight people that I did talk to said, you could use my name.

570
00:42:20,992 --> 00:42:25,177
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, you know what, let's see what the answers are in the follow through.

571
00:42:25,197 --> 00:42:27,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I will tell you, for the residents that are listening,

572
00:42:28,773 --> 00:42:46,840
[SPEAKER_03]: This is very frustrating for us because we ask these questions, not because we want to be rabble rousers because that's because this city administration has come up here and said, well, our, our, our directors, our directors in different departments are actually afraid to come to city council because of backlash or aggressive behavior.

573
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:52,462
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what we're putting office we're putting office to be their voice.

574
00:42:53,659 --> 00:43:00,743
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not an easy place to stand, but when you were elected or you're hired in a municipal field, that's part of your job.

575
00:43:01,763 --> 00:43:03,484
[SPEAKER_03]: That's your, that's part of your job requirements.

576
00:43:03,544 --> 00:43:11,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Come here and answer these questions so residents can understand what the process is.

577
00:43:11,868 --> 00:43:14,890
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just, I'm not sure if I heard councilor Scarpelli right.

578
00:43:14,910 --> 00:43:20,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Is he saying that the staff of the mayor who came up here and said that she's holding people accountable?

579
00:43:21,915 --> 00:43:24,457
[SPEAKER_07]: is scared to come before this council and be held accountable.

580
00:43:25,218 --> 00:43:37,747
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it sounds like to me Council Scarpelli is that they're scared to come before the city council and be held accountable, but the mayor comes up here and beats her chest, saying how she's holding people accountable when she's getting dragged out of here and handcuffs and making them undergo psychological evaluations.

581
00:43:38,248 --> 00:43:44,933
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm a little concerned about that and I thank the council for bringing that up and that's a very good point, but I know, and I'll end with this.

582
00:43:46,614 --> 00:43:53,929
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need more communication through the administration to really let our constituents know of these processes.

583
00:43:56,854 --> 00:43:59,616
[SPEAKER_03]: When no one comes up to answer these questions, everything's left open-ended.

584
00:44:00,277 --> 00:44:07,502
[SPEAKER_03]: And the frustration gets to a boiling point where we're seeing good people in this community putting for sale signs and moving out.

585
00:44:07,922 --> 00:44:09,904
[SPEAKER_03]: And that I hate to see.

586
00:44:10,244 --> 00:44:13,046
[SPEAKER_03]: And all it is sometimes is just simple conversation.

587
00:44:13,347 --> 00:44:17,069
[SPEAKER_03]: You saw what we did tonight with a very, very, very

588
00:44:18,150 --> 00:44:21,492
[SPEAKER_03]: productive business in our city and neighbors that had an issue.

589
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:28,197
[SPEAKER_03]: They got to sit down together because we opened the line of communication for them and they found the best avenue for both parties.

590
00:44:28,897 --> 00:44:33,941
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the things we need in our community and I think the city administration is really failing us.

591
00:44:34,001 --> 00:44:35,882
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, Madam President.

592
00:44:42,045 --> 00:45:07,341
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Morell and I think the two specific questions that Councilors are probably raised at the end are important ones to resurface for constituents I think if he's making a motion to have a committee of the whole on those two I think, I think that these are topics that we've talked about a lot this term already and I think that our city engineer and others in the engineering department have offered really helpful insight I mean just for me as an individual Councilor and resident.

593
00:45:08,021 --> 00:45:11,064
[SPEAKER_12]: The issue of how private ways interact with the rest of the city.

594
00:45:12,165 --> 00:45:20,712
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, it's it's genuinely confusing and they've given us good counsel before and I think that sort of that causal chain like if this then what if you live on a private way.

595
00:45:21,393 --> 00:45:26,958
[SPEAKER_12]: Clearly there's still more residents that we have to reach with that information I agree that we need a better communication strategy for that.

596
00:45:28,339 --> 00:45:32,343
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to raise you know I, I, I think that, um,

597
00:45:33,655 --> 00:45:34,096
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, no.

598
00:45:34,657 --> 00:45:35,678
[SPEAKER_12]: This is clearly an issue.

599
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:44,313
[SPEAKER_12]: One, because it's come up again, because it's come up so many times before this term, whether we've been talking about in the chambers, and I know that I've had one-on-one conversations with residents.

600
00:45:45,463 --> 00:45:48,406
[SPEAKER_12]: many times in my pretty short term so far.

601
00:45:48,426 --> 00:45:55,833
[SPEAKER_12]: I've had to go to the engineer and ask him for insight that I then relay back to the residents just about the various issues involved in living on private ways.

602
00:45:55,873 --> 00:46:08,065
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other thing that I think is important to note in this conversation in terms of, you know, what are the reasons that we're not serving our constituents and our constituents on private ways, you know, to the best of our ability is everybody is trying to

603
00:46:09,046 --> 00:46:11,410
[SPEAKER_12]: make do with pretty scarce resources.

604
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:18,140
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember one of the things that I've heard from members of our DPW staff and our engineer in the past is, you know,

605
00:46:18,896 --> 00:46:22,759
[SPEAKER_12]: matters of public safety are always prioritized when possible.

606
00:46:22,899 --> 00:46:29,983
[SPEAKER_12]: But our ceiling for what's possible is really low, and budgets are extremely tight when everybody's operating on skeleton resources.

607
00:46:30,564 --> 00:46:38,229
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't think that that is always the decision of individual staff people, but just operating in a very austere environment.

608
00:46:38,249 --> 00:46:46,574
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that's important to bring into conversation, because when we're talking about safety of our residents and safety of our residents in our private ways,

609
00:46:48,619 --> 00:47:02,460
[SPEAKER_12]: The decisions that we make and the decisions that the administration makes about the resources that we have to deploy around our community in the interest of aesthetics and public safety, that trickles down to individual cases like this.

610
00:47:03,180 --> 00:47:21,034
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I think it's fair to say we need insight from this position specifically and that role specifically, but also to say, if we don't have resources to go around where most of the people who come to us with an issue on a private way leave that conversation disappointed, we need to take a hard look at our books and see what would it take to be able to better serve those residents.

611
00:47:21,094 --> 00:47:27,940
[SPEAKER_12]: Because as I know, we've talked as a council about how expensive it is to bring a private way back into the public fold.

612
00:47:28,866 --> 00:47:39,050
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, you know, those are residents that were that we are sort of agreeing to leave in that situation when we don't build towards a plan where we can bring those back under public jurisdiction.

613
00:47:39,511 --> 00:47:47,974
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to raise the point that I think that this is this is part of the long term strategy to that we've been talking about all year is, you know, sort of lacking comprehensiveness.

614
00:47:48,714 --> 00:47:48,995
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

615
00:47:49,955 --> 00:47:50,975
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Caraviello.

616
00:47:51,296 --> 00:47:51,976
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

617
00:47:51,996 --> 00:47:52,636
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, Madam President.

618
00:47:52,656 --> 00:47:53,376
[SPEAKER_15]: No, this is something.

619
00:47:55,375 --> 00:47:56,955
[SPEAKER_15]: that we get questions on all the time.

620
00:47:57,336 --> 00:48:06,398
[SPEAKER_15]: But it seems like over the last year and a half is when these issues seem to come to a head.

621
00:48:07,778 --> 00:48:13,520
[SPEAKER_15]: The TPW in the past has always maintained these roads for the people and the best they could.

622
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,641
[SPEAKER_15]: They trimmed trees and they did whatever they could.

623
00:48:18,001 --> 00:48:22,702
[SPEAKER_15]: Now we're at the point, since this new engineer is taking over and under the administration,

624
00:48:23,853 --> 00:48:29,741
[SPEAKER_15]: We expect the people to pay for their own tree trimming, pay for their own street, pay for everything.

625
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:35,091
[SPEAKER_15]: and I don't see them getting a reduction in their tax rate.

626
00:48:35,832 --> 00:48:41,014
[SPEAKER_15]: They pay the same amount of taxes that everybody else in this room pays, and they're entitled to the same amount of services.

627
00:48:41,334 --> 00:48:50,517
[SPEAKER_15]: Not what our engineer decides is his idea of services, because this has just started under this new watch in the last year and a half.

628
00:48:50,537 --> 00:48:59,681
[SPEAKER_15]: So I thank Councilor Scott Pate for bringing this up, but this is, I say, this DPW has always taken care of these issues, and now they don't.

629
00:49:01,141 --> 00:49:01,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

630
00:49:03,102 --> 00:49:04,043
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

631
00:49:04,143 --> 00:49:06,765
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think that the engineer is the bad guy in this situation.

632
00:49:06,845 --> 00:49:16,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that the engineer is the fall guy, which is a difference because we've had previous administrations in this community that have allowed private ways to be provided with maintenance and services, okay?

633
00:49:17,152 --> 00:49:20,354
[SPEAKER_07]: And the only thing that's different is the administration, right?

634
00:49:20,394 --> 00:49:22,395
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is definitely an administrative prerogative.

635
00:49:22,936 --> 00:49:24,957
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something that we're seeing come down from the top.

636
00:49:25,437 --> 00:49:29,160
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not coming from the engineer across the city, it's coming from the boss, the mayor, all right?

637
00:49:30,037 --> 00:49:43,484
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we talk about this resolution and we talk about the issues that Councilor Scarpelli brings up, he says that the city is not maintaining private waste, which would infer that we're maintaining public waste, and we're not doing that either.

638
00:49:44,124 --> 00:49:59,252
[SPEAKER_07]: But when we talk about the services that you're entitled to and receive access to as a resident on a private way, we talk about access to the public schools, access to public safety and first response, snow removal and trash removal.

639
00:50:01,773 --> 00:50:02,795
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't get trees trimmed.

640
00:50:02,895 --> 00:50:04,057
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't get sidewalks fixed.

641
00:50:04,097 --> 00:50:05,038
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't get streets paved.

642
00:50:05,659 --> 00:50:07,122
[SPEAKER_07]: What about the underground infrastructure?

643
00:50:07,843 --> 00:50:09,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the responsibility of the taxpayer?

644
00:50:09,546 --> 00:50:10,868
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that the responsibility of the city?

645
00:50:13,092 --> 00:50:16,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so where does it stop and where does it start is a big question.

646
00:50:17,135 --> 00:50:27,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, I don't think people who live on private ways have a problem living on a private way, quite frankly, I don't think people that live on a private way would have a problem paying for some of these services that they want themselves.

647
00:50:28,282 --> 00:50:33,946
[SPEAKER_07]: I think part of the problem is that they can't get anybody to provide them with help when they want to initiate their rights at City Hall.

648
00:50:34,707 --> 00:50:39,330
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I lived on a private way and I said look at I want to put up a crash bar and I want to say resident access only.

649
00:50:40,612 --> 00:50:43,634
[SPEAKER_07]: Say Wildwood Road, for example, right across the street from Medford High School.

650
00:50:43,855 --> 00:50:44,595
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a private way.

651
00:50:45,256 --> 00:50:54,703
[SPEAKER_07]: Why can't they put up, just like they have on Rosina Drive in the Heights, on Murray Hill Road in the Heights, a crash bar where cars can't drive down that street because it's a private way.

652
00:50:55,944 --> 00:50:57,265
[SPEAKER_07]: And they can tell you when and when you can't.

653
00:50:57,845 --> 00:51:00,467
[SPEAKER_07]: The fire department can still provide emergency access.

654
00:51:00,487 --> 00:51:02,188
[SPEAKER_07]: The police department can still have emergency access.

655
00:51:02,228 --> 00:51:03,589
[SPEAKER_07]: The MS can still have emergency access.

656
00:51:06,322 --> 00:51:20,572
[SPEAKER_07]: and these residents that live on the streets that are abutting the Mystic Lakes complain year in and year out about the fact that neighborhoods being overrun and inundated by people that are parking on their private ways in front of their houses and their driveways and the like to access the Mystic Lakes.

657
00:51:22,313 --> 00:51:28,477
[SPEAKER_07]: But the city doesn't provide them with the information or the tools necessary to protect themselves on their private way, but won't provide them the services either.

658
00:51:29,038 --> 00:51:30,078
[SPEAKER_07]: It becomes very frustrating.

659
00:51:30,919 --> 00:51:33,761
[SPEAKER_07]: And inaction is not an answer or a response.

660
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,481
[SPEAKER_07]: to a circumstance in the community.

661
00:51:37,362 --> 00:51:46,910
[SPEAKER_07]: So meetings are great, but ultimately we've had a number of meetings on this back in September and even previously, and we're still talking about it because there's been inaction.

662
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:52,394
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the difference between what makes a thriving community and what makes a failing community.

663
00:51:52,934 --> 00:52:02,382
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we talk about the one thing that people want when they move into a city is they wanna make sure that their tax dollars stretch a long way, they get banked for their buck and they're provided with city services.

664
00:52:03,391 --> 00:52:08,075
[SPEAKER_07]: We have over 30% of the streets in this community that are private ways and we're not providing those people with services.

665
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,137
[SPEAKER_07]: Thus far, I feel as though we're failing them.

666
00:52:10,818 --> 00:52:22,128
[SPEAKER_07]: We're failing them because we're not providing them with any recourse information or ability to enact or enact their rights or enable themselves to protect their, their investment in their future destiny in the community.

667
00:52:22,428 --> 00:52:23,069
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Madam President.

668
00:52:23,089 --> 00:52:23,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

669
00:52:24,490 --> 00:52:25,171
[SPEAKER_14]: President Bears.

670
00:52:25,631 --> 00:52:27,393
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President, I just wanted to note that.

671
00:52:28,215 --> 00:52:38,663
[SPEAKER_02]: We did hold a meeting on private ways with the DPW commissioner on October 25th, 2022, and that recording is available through Medford Community Media.

672
00:52:38,843 --> 00:52:47,429
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also more information about the city's policies on private ways around enforcement on the city website and the police department website.

673
00:52:48,010 --> 00:52:48,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

674
00:52:49,222 --> 00:52:54,727
[SPEAKER_14]: And just go probably apologize was your motion to have a committee of the whole on this topic and invite the city engineer, or.

675
00:52:54,747 --> 00:53:03,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Madam President, I think that the goal for this is really to educate the constituents, and

676
00:53:04,842 --> 00:53:10,125
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I would like to see a community hall with those residents of private ways, get the word out.

677
00:53:10,205 --> 00:53:34,399
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate Councilor Knight and Councilor Bears sending that information, but when you are living to a certain standard here, and you've grown up in a private way or lived in a private way, and all of a sudden snap a finger, the way that you've lived your life, things have changed now, whether it's right, wrong or indifferent.

678
00:53:36,375 --> 00:53:51,809
[SPEAKER_03]: The residents that live in those private ways have to be reeducated and really have to acknowledge what needs to be expected as they move on.

679
00:53:51,849 --> 00:53:54,391
[SPEAKER_03]: If this is the way it goes, like Councilor Knight said,

680
00:53:55,478 --> 00:53:58,080
[SPEAKER_03]: the I don't blame the city engineer in any way.

681
00:53:58,921 --> 00:54:04,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I question his his behavior or his tone with what residents have told me.

682
00:54:04,926 --> 00:54:11,751
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, I'd like I said, if he was here, I'd love to ask him but but that's the what I question with our our city engineer.

683
00:54:12,192 --> 00:54:13,453
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, my question is really

684
00:54:14,962 --> 00:54:18,843
[SPEAKER_03]: you're making changes, sweeping changes that are really affecting our community.

685
00:54:19,624 --> 00:54:26,546
[SPEAKER_03]: And especially when it comes to public safety, when people are expecting their sidewalks to get done.

686
00:54:26,566 --> 00:54:35,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Because imagine if, like Councilor Knight said, you have a sidewalk that's panels lifted, you have an elderly parent that lives in your home with you.

687
00:54:36,069 --> 00:54:41,111
[SPEAKER_03]: You're expecting the city to make these changes because they've been on this list, so they wait.

688
00:54:42,377 --> 00:54:45,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Now all of a sudden they're told that after three years you're top of that list.

689
00:54:45,545 --> 00:54:48,492
[SPEAKER_03]: They know we're not fixing it because you're a private way.

690
00:54:48,713 --> 00:54:49,715
[SPEAKER_03]: We're changing our policy.

691
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:52,735
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the process.

692
00:54:52,775 --> 00:55:00,960
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need to meet with all of these departments and really set the tone with how to reeducate our private way residents.

693
00:55:01,020 --> 00:55:13,748
[SPEAKER_03]: And then maybe they have to answer some questions about legitimate questions that were brought about on detours and sending heavy trucking that ruined a street that has just been paved.

694
00:55:13,848 --> 00:55:16,029
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are legitimate issues.

695
00:55:16,169 --> 00:55:17,290
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you, Madam President.

696
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:18,234
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you guys.

697
00:55:18,394 --> 00:55:38,740
[SPEAKER_02]: President Bears Thank you Madam President, and I just want to reiterate I don't disagree with that at all I think this actually really speaks to why it's so important that the mayor approves these charter ballot questions that we just move forward, and we implement the better budget plan because we need to have an honest conversation what is it going to cost to bring everything up to a state of good repair, what is it going to cost to bring all these private ways in the public domain.

698
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:40,860
[SPEAKER_02]: and we need a plan for it.

699
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:44,861
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now we don't even have the process to have the conversations to come up with a plan.

700
00:55:44,921 --> 00:55:49,843
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're stuck with scheduling this meeting and that meeting and the police have a meeting and we had a subcommittee meeting.

701
00:55:49,883 --> 00:55:52,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we have a committee, the whole meeting, but we need a budget plan.

702
00:55:53,143 --> 00:55:57,245
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's why I'm so glad that the council moved forward on these amendments.

703
00:55:57,365 --> 00:56:01,506
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really hope that the mayor moves forward on them as well so that the voters can have a choice.

704
00:56:03,366 --> 00:56:04,186
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Vice President Bears.

705
00:56:04,306 --> 00:56:05,647
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a motion from

706
00:56:08,419 --> 00:56:10,940
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a motion from apologies.

707
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:11,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

708
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:17,581
[SPEAKER_14]: We have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli for a committee of the whole to invite the city engineer as well as all residents.

709
00:56:17,681 --> 00:56:17,822
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

710
00:56:18,022 --> 00:56:22,483
[SPEAKER_04]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

711
00:56:22,523 --> 00:56:24,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

712
00:56:40,245 --> 00:56:42,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Bears.

713
00:56:42,226 --> 00:56:42,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

714
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:43,386
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

715
00:56:44,106 --> 00:56:44,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

716
00:56:45,267 --> 00:56:45,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

717
00:56:45,827 --> 00:56:47,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

718
00:56:47,107 --> 00:56:47,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

719
00:56:47,767 --> 00:56:48,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

720
00:56:48,828 --> 00:56:49,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

721
00:56:50,148 --> 00:56:50,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

722
00:56:50,828 --> 00:56:51,028
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

723
00:56:51,108 --> 00:57:03,352
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm in the affirmative zero negative the motion passes to three dash three to two offered by Councilor Knight be resolved in preparation for budget discussions at the city administration furnish the following information related to school spending.

724
00:57:04,055 --> 00:57:08,139
[SPEAKER_14]: One, cost to date for the per diem payments made to David Murphy, former assistant superintendent.

725
00:57:08,359 --> 00:57:13,485
[SPEAKER_14]: Two, cost of KP law investigation of the MHS softball team and results of findings of the investigation.

726
00:57:14,005 --> 00:57:20,011
[SPEAKER_14]: Three, cost per week related for teachers covering hallway security details in MHS since the much publicized stabbing incident.

727
00:57:20,532 --> 00:57:25,877
[SPEAKER_14]: Four, an explanation of the difference in duties and responsibilities of the following positions, data manager and data director.

728
00:57:26,483 --> 00:57:36,209
[SPEAKER_14]: and read an explanation as to the reasoning behind the salary disparity between the positions and five costs and copy of the report performed by Welch et al relative to school safety and security.

729
00:57:36,269 --> 00:57:36,789
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

730
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:38,591
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam President, thank you very much.

731
00:57:38,811 --> 00:57:45,075
[SPEAKER_07]: These are some items that have been popular fodder for discussion in our community over recent months.

732
00:57:46,896 --> 00:57:50,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Recently, the school department has met and they've discussed their budget priorities.

733
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:53,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks like they're about eight or $900,000 short from where they'd like to be.

734
00:57:56,712 --> 00:58:04,416
[SPEAKER_07]: I've always had an issue with the school committee and their ability to manage within their budget sometimes.

735
00:58:05,316 --> 00:58:10,018
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like sometimes you've got to make hard decisions, and that's what elected officials are putting these positions for.

736
00:58:10,878 --> 00:58:17,021
[SPEAKER_07]: And when it comes time to tightening the belt and spending within your means, sometimes our school committee does not do that.

737
00:58:17,481 --> 00:58:20,122
[SPEAKER_07]: And as a result, we see some wasteful spending.

738
00:58:21,022 --> 00:58:24,424
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been brought to my attention that some of these cost items that are

739
00:58:25,224 --> 00:58:29,207
[SPEAKER_07]: included in this list, Madam President, are reaching astronomical figures.

740
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:43,516
[SPEAKER_07]: For example, it's my understanding that the cost for teachers covering hallway security duties is somewhere around $25,000 to $35,000 a week of ARPA money being spent for teachers to monitor the hallways up in Method High.

741
00:58:44,076 --> 00:58:45,297
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we're talking about

742
00:58:46,999 --> 00:58:49,844
[SPEAKER_07]: a school committee's professed shortfall of about $800,000.

743
00:58:49,984 --> 00:58:55,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's take a look at some of the spending that we're doing when we talk about the investigation into the NHL softball team.

744
00:58:56,015 --> 00:58:57,518
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we have attorney Howard Greenspan

745
00:58:58,653 --> 00:59:00,894
[SPEAKER_07]: as the school department's attorney who's on retainer.

746
00:59:01,274 --> 00:59:03,134
[SPEAKER_07]: Did KP Law conduct the investigation?

747
00:59:03,314 --> 00:59:03,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

748
00:59:04,074 --> 00:59:05,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Why did KP Law conduct the investigation?

749
00:59:05,815 --> 00:59:06,995
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that a special contract?

750
00:59:07,075 --> 00:59:10,216
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that something that fell outside the scope of our contract with KP Law?

751
00:59:10,576 --> 00:59:11,916
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that something we're going to be assessed for?

752
00:59:12,116 --> 00:59:12,876
[SPEAKER_07]: How much did it cost?

753
00:59:12,976 --> 00:59:14,457
[SPEAKER_07]: What were the findings of the investigation?

754
00:59:14,917 --> 00:59:16,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Was it a worthy expenditure?

755
00:59:16,457 --> 00:59:19,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Should we have used internal counsel that we have on retainer or should we have gone outside?

756
00:59:20,513 --> 00:59:21,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Is this wasteful spending?

757
00:59:22,034 --> 00:59:28,616
[SPEAKER_07]: So Madam President, these are some things that I want to take a look at when we talk about the position of data manager and the position of data director.

758
00:59:29,516 --> 00:59:32,817
[SPEAKER_07]: From what I understand, they have the exact same duties, responsibilities and functions.

759
00:59:33,477 --> 00:59:34,878
[SPEAKER_07]: The only difference is the salary.

760
00:59:36,018 --> 00:59:42,201
[SPEAKER_07]: the incumbent that's in the position is a female who's going to make $10,000 to $15,000 less than the new appointee who's a male.

761
00:59:42,822 --> 00:59:45,123
[SPEAKER_07]: But their responsibilities and duties really aren't that different.

762
00:59:45,303 --> 00:59:46,483
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to know what's going on.

763
00:59:46,523 --> 00:59:50,305
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is there such a disparity in the wages between these two positions?

764
00:59:50,506 --> 00:59:53,407
[SPEAKER_07]: And why is there a need for two positions with duplicate duties?

765
00:59:55,028 --> 00:59:56,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, you know,

766
00:59:57,753 --> 00:59:58,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Medford High has been on the news a lot.

767
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:01,656
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not for winning state championships, all right?

768
01:00:01,876 --> 01:00:04,058
[SPEAKER_07]: It's because of violence in our school department.

769
01:00:04,718 --> 01:00:06,720
[SPEAKER_07]: So the school department went and they hired a consultant.

770
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:10,523
[SPEAKER_07]: They spent a lot of money on a consultant to file a report, and this report makes suggestions.

771
01:00:11,483 --> 01:00:26,514
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to know what these suggestions are, what the cost of the report was, and whether or not these suggestions are even being implemented, or whether it was just a, let's get us out of the news, hire a consultant to come in here and do a report, and then we can wave the report in the air and say, no, we did something, but not implement any of the changes that they've asked for.

772
01:00:27,737 --> 01:00:41,082
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we talk about previous administration of the school department, and we talk about a gentleman like Mr. Belson, who'd come before us, and who would talk about school violence, well, Roy was one of the founders of the STARS program, right?

773
01:00:41,402 --> 01:00:47,304
[SPEAKER_07]: The School Threat Assessment and Response System that's been implemented statewide, okay?

774
01:00:49,165 --> 01:00:54,307
[SPEAKER_07]: That was in response to an issue back in the early 90s.

775
01:00:56,495 --> 01:01:06,202
[SPEAKER_07]: What steps has this administration taken to put in something like a STARS program that would assess violence on our school systems and establish reasonable response?

776
01:01:09,224 --> 01:01:11,046
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are some of the things that I have great concern about.

777
01:01:11,446 --> 01:01:15,389
[SPEAKER_07]: We all talk about you can't put a price tag on public safety, but apparently you can't.

778
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:22,835
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if this is any truth to this expenditure at $33,000 a week in APA funds being assigned for teachers to monitor the halls,

779
01:01:24,287 --> 01:01:31,690
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's gross negligence in terms of spending, and it's a gross negligence of the fiduciary responsibility of the stewards of our taxes.

780
01:01:32,210 --> 01:01:33,830
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's pretty self-explanatory.

781
01:01:33,870 --> 01:01:39,272
[SPEAKER_07]: When we get the answers to the questions, we'll be in a better position to figure out exactly what's going on here.

782
01:01:39,892 --> 01:01:44,894
[SPEAKER_07]: This council's been asking now for financial data for three years, and we haven't been receiving it forthwith.

783
01:01:45,294 --> 01:01:53,537
[SPEAKER_07]: So my hope was to put this on the agenda to give everybody ample notice and time to prepare it, to give it to us before our budget discussions finalize at the end of the month, Madam President.

784
01:01:53,999 --> 01:01:54,299
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

785
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:56,721
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further discussion from the council?

786
01:01:59,744 --> 01:02:15,036
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing none, on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

787
01:02:16,497 --> 01:02:17,317
[SPEAKER_14]: Temporarily absent.

788
01:02:19,739 --> 01:02:19,799
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

789
01:02:26,348 --> 01:02:26,808
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

790
01:02:27,349 --> 01:02:27,629
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

791
01:02:28,569 --> 01:02:29,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

792
01:02:29,430 --> 01:02:31,051
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

793
01:02:31,671 --> 01:02:31,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

794
01:02:36,354 --> 01:02:36,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

795
01:02:37,435 --> 01:02:43,639
[SPEAKER_14]: So five in the affirmative one in the negative one absent motion passes to three.

796
01:02:44,659 --> 01:02:49,842
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a paper that also includes vices and Pharisees out but I will keep going.

797
01:02:52,488 --> 01:02:53,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Would you like me to wait?

798
01:02:53,389 --> 01:02:54,849
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll survive without him, Madam President.

799
01:02:55,330 --> 01:02:55,550
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry?

800
01:02:55,770 --> 01:02:56,531
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll survive without him.

801
01:02:56,671 --> 01:02:56,931
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

802
01:02:57,751 --> 01:03:02,855
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a zoning paper, but 23-323 offered by Councilor Caraviello, Councilor Collins, and Vice President Bears.

803
01:03:03,415 --> 01:03:07,458
[SPEAKER_14]: Proposed amendments to the Medford zoning ordinance for June 2023.

804
01:03:07,698 --> 01:03:14,202
[SPEAKER_07]: Number one, amend table of use and- Madam President, motion to waive the reading and refer to the CD board as pursuant to Massachusetts General Election Act 41A.

805
01:03:14,782 --> 01:03:15,563
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

806
01:03:15,723 --> 01:03:22,167
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a motion from Councilor Knight to waive the reading and refer to the CD board, seconded by-

807
01:03:23,743 --> 01:03:31,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviello, any discussion before we take that vote as this is procedural to refer to the CD board per MGL?

808
01:03:34,950 --> 01:03:43,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Seeing none, we have to, so yeah, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll to move the reading and refer to the CD board.

809
01:03:54,220 --> 01:03:54,400
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

810
01:03:54,420 --> 01:03:54,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

811
01:04:01,085 --> 01:04:01,565
[SPEAKER_04]: President?

812
01:04:01,845 --> 01:04:04,387
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, six in the affirmative, zero in the negative, one absent.

813
01:04:04,407 --> 01:04:05,068
[SPEAKER_14]: The motion passes.

814
01:04:05,088 --> 01:04:06,749
[SPEAKER_14]: The paper is referred to the CD board.

815
01:04:06,869 --> 01:04:10,131
[SPEAKER_07]: On that point, Madam President, I'd just like to ask that the city clerk calendar this event.

816
01:04:10,591 --> 01:04:17,215
[SPEAKER_07]: As we know, because this is a zoning change, it's pursuant to certain rules and regulations established by state law that create timelines for us to act.

817
01:04:18,296 --> 01:04:20,518
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we don't act in time, then we got to start over from scratch.

818
01:04:20,538 --> 01:04:25,181
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a very important matter that I think we need to keep an eye on when we're coming into summer break.

819
01:04:25,221 --> 01:04:26,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Sometimes these things fall off the shelf.

820
01:04:26,882 --> 01:04:30,244
[SPEAKER_07]: So I just ask that the city clerk keep us in line to make sure that we do our job.

821
01:04:30,818 --> 01:04:31,098
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

822
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:35,502
[SPEAKER_14]: And I do see just Director Hunt and City Planner Daniel Evans are also on a call.

823
01:04:35,542 --> 01:04:38,345
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're also paying attention to that timeline, I'm sure.

824
01:04:40,727 --> 01:04:43,769
[SPEAKER_14]: So I will go to, I'm gonna thumbs up from Director Hunt.

825
01:04:43,809 --> 01:04:45,251
[SPEAKER_14]: So she is on it as well.

826
01:04:46,252 --> 01:04:47,773
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I'm sorry.

827
01:04:47,793 --> 01:04:49,935
[SPEAKER_14]: 21, okay.

828
01:04:51,236 --> 01:04:51,897
[SPEAKER_14]: Skipping ahead to page 21.

829
01:04:56,289 --> 01:05:03,273
[SPEAKER_14]: vacations from the mayor to three dash 324 to Honorable President and members of the Medford City Council regarding donation acceptances.

830
01:05:03,874 --> 01:05:20,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Dear President Morella members of the city council I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves under MGL chapter 44 section 53 a a donation of $500 from Boston Proud Corp for the use of pride and a donation of $350 for instigators from instigators LLC to the city for filming in the

01:05:21,447 --> 01:05:25,248
[SPEAKER_14]: for filming in the upper city hall mall, a lot respectfully submitted.

832
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:26,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Breanna Lungo-Koehn mayor.

833
01:05:28,229 --> 01:05:28,649
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam president.

834
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:29,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight.

835
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:36,452
[SPEAKER_07]: If we could get a written explanation from the city administration as to why someone would pay us for the use of pride, because I'm not too sure what that means.

836
01:05:36,752 --> 01:05:37,653
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

837
01:05:38,053 --> 01:05:39,473
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be great, but it's 500 bucks.

838
01:05:39,733 --> 01:05:41,334
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, total value of this paper is $850.

839
01:05:41,374 --> 01:05:43,054
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

840
01:05:43,134 --> 01:05:45,815
[SPEAKER_07]: I move approval on the paper, but I would like a written explanation.

841
01:05:46,416 --> 01:05:47,656
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a motion to approve.

842
01:05:48,436 --> 01:05:50,197
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a motion.

843
01:05:51,150 --> 01:05:54,812
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Knight to approve as amended by Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

844
01:05:55,633 --> 01:05:56,893
[SPEAKER_14]: Any further discussion from the council?

845
01:05:58,154 --> 01:05:59,155
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

846
01:06:09,341 --> 01:06:09,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Bears.

847
01:06:10,021 --> 01:06:10,301
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

848
01:06:10,862 --> 01:06:11,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello.

849
01:06:11,482 --> 01:06:11,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

850
01:06:12,563 --> 01:06:13,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins.

851
01:06:13,743 --> 01:06:13,983
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

852
01:06:15,344 --> 01:06:17,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

853
01:06:17,445 --> 01:06:17,666
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

854
01:06:18,206 --> 01:06:18,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng.

855
01:06:19,427 --> 01:06:19,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

856
01:06:21,638 --> 01:06:24,359
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, 70% negative the motion passes.

857
01:06:25,860 --> 01:06:28,582
[SPEAKER_14]: Communications from city officers and employees.

858
01:06:29,523 --> 01:06:32,345
[SPEAKER_14]: This actually has the same number as the previous I should have caught that.

859
01:06:33,165 --> 01:06:33,946
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll just update that.

860
01:06:35,887 --> 01:06:50,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, 23-324 and we will update that preliminary election September 12 motion to waive the reading and have the city clerk announced the dates as to when that early voting will be available on the motion of Council night to waive the reading and have the city clerk announced the

861
01:06:51,103 --> 01:06:56,747
[SPEAKER_14]: dates as to when early voting will be available, seconded by... I'd extend that to both papers, Madam President.

862
01:06:56,767 --> 01:06:57,448
[SPEAKER_14]: To both papers.

863
01:06:57,468 --> 01:07:02,172
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll have an overview from the city clerk on both papers.

864
01:07:06,415 --> 01:07:07,916
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sorry?

865
01:07:08,196 --> 01:07:09,197
[SPEAKER_14]: From the elections manager?

866
01:07:11,079 --> 01:07:11,939
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

867
01:07:11,959 --> 01:07:12,700
[SPEAKER_14]: City clerk, okay.

868
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:13,361
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a motion.

869
01:07:13,401 --> 01:07:18,885
[SPEAKER_14]: Not after the last... We have a motion from Councilor Knight and seconded by...

870
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:30,866
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Scarpelli, I believe, to waive the reading and have just the City Clerk brief us on the dates for early voting and the municipal election.

871
01:07:31,127 --> 01:07:33,568
[SPEAKER_14]: And I believe there's actually three papers.

872
01:07:37,391 --> 01:07:38,332
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually no, that's a separate one.

873
01:07:38,392 --> 01:07:39,593
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, on those two papers.

874
01:07:40,614 --> 01:07:41,574
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

875
01:07:42,295 --> 01:07:42,655
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a no.

876
01:07:50,753 --> 01:07:51,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Nielsen.

877
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:52,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

878
01:07:54,876 --> 01:07:55,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight.

879
01:07:55,497 --> 01:07:55,737
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

880
01:07:55,797 --> 01:07:57,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli.

881
01:07:57,458 --> 01:07:57,779
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

882
01:07:58,439 --> 01:07:58,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng.

883
01:07:59,560 --> 01:07:59,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

884
01:08:01,422 --> 01:08:01,962
[SPEAKER_04]: President Morell.

885
01:08:02,803 --> 01:08:05,885
[SPEAKER_14]: No, so five in the affirmative, two in the negative, motion passes.

886
01:08:06,065 --> 01:08:13,211
[SPEAKER_14]: We were gonna waive the reading and have an update from the city clerk on the election dates that are before us in these papers.

887
01:08:16,914 --> 01:08:17,475
[SPEAKER_14]: President Bears.

888
01:08:18,453 --> 01:08:22,134
[SPEAKER_02]: I respect what Councilor Knight's saying, but the city clerk's no longer involved in elections.

889
01:08:22,795 --> 01:08:27,176
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we should try and do anything to not reinforce that they're separate offices.

890
01:08:29,097 --> 01:08:30,597
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's just my opinion.

891
01:08:31,078 --> 01:08:31,778
[SPEAKER_14]: Understood.

892
01:08:32,018 --> 01:08:40,281
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we took the vote, the motion passed, we can have the clerk read the dates and then we can open up to participation on the paper.

893
01:08:40,441 --> 01:08:43,302
[SPEAKER_14]: So if anyone else wants to speak.

894
01:08:44,642 --> 01:08:46,123
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, am I missing something here?

895
01:08:46,143 --> 01:08:48,965
[SPEAKER_07]: All we're doing is announcing what the early voting dates are, because, you know what I mean?

896
01:08:48,985 --> 01:08:51,586
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems like it's a pretty self-explanatory paper over there.

897
01:08:51,686 --> 01:08:53,988
[SPEAKER_07]: All it is is a public service announcement, as far as I can tell, right?

898
01:08:54,328 --> 01:08:54,708
[SPEAKER_14]: Understood.

899
01:08:54,968 --> 01:08:58,810
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll have the clerk read, and then if anyone wants to speak on it as the candidate agenda item.

900
01:08:59,711 --> 01:09:11,898
[SPEAKER_04]: For the preliminary election on September 12th, early voting dates, September 5th, which is a Tuesday from 8.30 to 4.30, September 6th, which is a Wednesday from 8.30 to 7.30,

901
01:09:13,794 --> 01:09:21,058
[SPEAKER_04]: September 7th, a Thursday from 830 to 430 and September 8th, a Friday from 830 to 1230 p.m.

902
01:09:27,481 --> 01:09:30,643
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the hours for the September election.

903
01:09:30,663 --> 01:09:40,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Proposed hours for the November 7th election for early voting.

904
01:09:42,526 --> 01:09:43,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Monday, October 30th from 8.30 to 4.30.

905
01:09:44,147 --> 01:09:45,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Tuesday, October 31st from 8.30 to 4.30.

906
01:09:45,067 --> 01:09:47,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Wednesday, November 1st from 8.30 to 7.30.

907
01:09:47,049 --> 01:09:48,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Thursday, November 2nd from 8.30 to 4.30 p.m.

908
01:09:48,209 --> 01:09:49,070
[SPEAKER_04]: Any discussion from the council?

909
01:10:12,949 --> 01:10:14,170
[SPEAKER_15]: Why is there no Saturdays here?

910
01:10:15,590 --> 01:10:16,210
[SPEAKER_15]: Is there a reason?

911
01:10:16,390 --> 01:10:31,395
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we've done it in the past on Saturdays.

912
01:10:31,955 --> 01:10:35,576
[SPEAKER_09]: Saturdays when there are federal and state elections because it's a local election.

913
01:10:36,115 --> 01:10:43,919
[SPEAKER_09]: We're trying to keep it during the week when we have staff in hand and keep the overtime hours down.

914
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:46,181
[SPEAKER_09]: But we are not required.

915
01:10:46,401 --> 01:10:48,202
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a courtesy to voters.

916
01:10:48,562 --> 01:10:54,005
[SPEAKER_09]: The reason why this information is presented to you tonight is because it's an opt-in situation.

917
01:10:54,085 --> 01:11:00,969
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're requesting that you accept our presentation on early voting hours, early voting person hours.

918
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:02,970
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

919
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:04,671
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Bears.

920
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:13,063
[SPEAKER_07]: The paper before us has no language on it, legal or otherwise, saying it doesn't mean the City Council opt in to support early voting.

921
01:11:13,083 --> 01:11:16,384
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't tell us when the dates are going to be.

922
01:11:16,824 --> 01:11:23,565
[SPEAKER_07]: So from a legal standpoint, I mean, usually if there's an opt-in, there's some certain language that you need to adopt or support in order for an opt-in to happen.

923
01:11:24,725 --> 01:11:26,366
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you able to offer clarity on that?

924
01:11:26,466 --> 01:11:28,166
[SPEAKER_14]: Is this something that the Council needs to know?

925
01:11:28,206 --> 01:11:32,247
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not the paper that's before us this evening.

926
01:11:32,807 --> 01:11:34,587
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, I can offer clarification.

927
01:11:35,588 --> 01:11:51,154
[SPEAKER_09]: What we're doing is the Election Commission has approved within their meetings the dates of early voting, and as a courtesy to the board at the City Council, we're offering them the opportunity just to agree and accept that these are the dates that we're going to do.

928
01:11:51,695 --> 01:11:54,896
[SPEAKER_09]: And if there were any questions, we would answer any questions about that at that time.

929
01:11:54,936 --> 01:11:55,296
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, thank you.

930
01:11:55,316 --> 01:11:55,976
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a courtesy.

931
01:11:56,016 --> 01:11:57,497
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not something that would change anything.

932
01:11:57,517 --> 01:11:58,517
[SPEAKER_06]: So we don't have to take any action.

933
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:03,962
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a courtesy.

934
01:12:04,042 --> 01:12:08,206
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a necessary mechanism of government for us to take a vote for this to happen, right?

935
01:12:08,246 --> 01:12:10,368
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to happen no matter what.

936
01:12:10,989 --> 01:12:14,812
[SPEAKER_09]: It's important, informative, and we also just appreciate you.

937
01:12:15,487 --> 01:12:17,168
[SPEAKER_09]: accepting what we've presented to you.

938
01:12:17,188 --> 01:12:23,130
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't have to write the board just an autonomous board that's made its determination and they're presenting us their findings.

939
01:12:23,190 --> 01:12:25,451
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm fine with that.

940
01:12:25,731 --> 01:12:27,032
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

941
01:12:27,272 --> 01:12:28,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Madam President.

942
01:12:28,172 --> 01:12:31,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I for one, I'm not comfortable with not having Saturdays.

943
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:33,034
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Saturdays are really important for early voting.

944
01:12:33,054 --> 01:12:35,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we know municipal elections are the least

945
01:12:38,802 --> 01:12:42,085
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we should give them the most opportunity to get people to vote.

946
01:12:43,206 --> 01:12:49,631
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why I was so concerned with the budget presented to us for the election office because it sounds like we're trying not to spend more money this year.

947
01:12:49,651 --> 01:12:55,755
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not going to do early voting on Saturdays for municipal election when we're electing the mayor and the city council, the school committee.

948
01:12:56,716 --> 01:13:05,964
[SPEAKER_02]: the three offices probably that actually impact residents' lives the most of any government office versus I'm pretty sure I know how Medford's gonna vote in November 2024 and 2026 and 2028.

949
01:13:06,024 --> 01:13:12,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope, maybe I'm wrong, I don't know.

950
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:21,778
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just feel really uncomfortable not having the Saturdays and

951
01:13:22,817 --> 01:13:29,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've done more, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe we've done more early voting for municipal elections in previous years than this amount that's being offered.

952
01:13:31,384 --> 01:13:38,389
[SPEAKER_09]: So for state, I can't speak to early voting for municipal elections prior to this.

953
01:13:38,909 --> 01:13:51,619
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that early voting with the state, they do give us requirements as to what we have to offer when it's a state and federal election required to do Saturdays and Sundays based on the population of the city of Metzger.

954
01:13:52,239 --> 01:13:56,160
[SPEAKER_09]: What I will offer to you is I understand that Saturdays are important.

955
01:13:56,220 --> 01:14:01,682
[SPEAKER_09]: However, when we've done elections on Saturdays, they are lower turnouts.

956
01:14:02,642 --> 01:14:16,686
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the idea is that if we keep the election availability during the week, as well as doing early voting via ballots, early mail to ballots, we actually may get the same amount of people as opposed to offering Saturday time.

957
01:14:18,004 --> 01:14:18,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

958
01:14:18,404 --> 01:14:18,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

959
01:14:18,705 --> 01:14:25,392
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we definitely last general election offered five days early voting, including a Saturday as well as vote by mail.

960
01:14:25,973 --> 01:14:28,615
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we should at least continue with what we've done in the past.

961
01:14:29,536 --> 01:14:31,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that for a municipal election?

962
01:14:31,118 --> 01:14:32,840
[SPEAKER_02]: That was municipal election, November 2nd, 2021.

963
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:33,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

964
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:33,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

965
01:14:38,718 --> 01:14:38,978
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

966
01:14:38,998 --> 01:14:44,684
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to add my voice to the choir supporting Saturday early voting dates.

967
01:14:44,905 --> 01:14:58,059
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, respectfully, I think it's really important for accessibility, and even if Saturday sees lower turnout, per se, a lot of those voters might only be able to vote on Saturday, or that might be the most

968
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,761
[SPEAKER_01]: by far the most convenient option for them.

969
01:15:00,922 --> 01:15:05,925
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wouldn't want to take that piece of our democracy away.

970
01:15:06,826 --> 01:15:14,851
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anything we can do to sustain that, to keep that as an option, I think is really important.

971
01:15:14,871 --> 01:15:18,994
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

972
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:19,635
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Collins.

973
01:15:21,336 --> 01:15:22,437
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, President Morell.

974
01:15:22,957 --> 01:15:23,598
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree with that.

975
01:15:23,698 --> 01:15:27,880
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that having a weekend opportunity is very important.

976
01:15:27,961 --> 01:15:29,962
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, people have different schedules, different work schedules.

977
01:15:30,362 --> 01:15:34,065
[SPEAKER_12]: I also want to note to Election Manager Ripley, I apologize.

978
01:15:34,105 --> 01:15:36,046
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I misunderstood the previous motion we took.

979
01:15:36,066 --> 01:15:47,674
[SPEAKER_12]: I certainly didn't want to preempt your office's opportunity to speak on the presentation that you've created, especially since this is an opportunity to get the word out to residents and voters about what to expect for our

980
01:15:49,221 --> 01:15:57,028
[SPEAKER_12]: elections in September and November, so I know there's a lot of, you know, great kind of FAQ information submitted onto our agenda.

981
01:15:58,189 --> 01:16:09,839
[SPEAKER_12]: Certainly, if there's anything more that you wanted to share or were planning to share relating to the Miss Paul elections, the sort of know before you go section, I'd certainly be eager to hear that from your office.

982
01:16:10,059 --> 01:16:10,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

983
01:16:12,021 --> 01:16:12,301
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

984
01:16:12,381 --> 01:16:12,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Caraviellol.

985
01:16:13,397 --> 01:16:21,900
[SPEAKER_15]: President, I'd make a motion that these papers be sent back to the commission for re-examination and reconsideration for Saturday voting.

986
01:16:25,095 --> 01:16:26,957
[SPEAKER_07]: The paper requires an election from the council.

987
01:16:27,517 --> 01:16:27,878
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

988
01:16:27,918 --> 01:16:32,521
[SPEAKER_07]: So my worst fear is Oh, well, I didn't get a chance to vote because early voting wasn't open on Wednesday, the 5th.

989
01:16:32,661 --> 01:16:34,103
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the city council approved the schedule.

990
01:16:34,383 --> 01:16:36,184
[SPEAKER_07]: City Council has no authority on this whatsoever.

991
01:16:36,885 --> 01:16:39,227
[SPEAKER_07]: So we can recommend that they open on Saturday.

992
01:16:39,247 --> 01:16:40,068
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a problem with that.

993
01:16:40,408 --> 01:16:43,911
[SPEAKER_07]: But in terms of supporting the plan and not supporting the plan, we don't have to do it.

994
01:16:43,951 --> 01:16:46,193
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we should.

995
01:16:46,213 --> 01:16:50,096
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have a motion on the floor before yours from Council night to receive a place on file.

996
01:16:50,648 --> 01:16:56,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Before we get to that, I just also want to add my voice to the chorus of just concerns about not having a Saturday voting.

997
01:16:56,832 --> 01:16:58,753
[SPEAKER_14]: I think Councilor Tseng made a really good point.

998
01:16:58,773 --> 01:17:03,797
[SPEAKER_14]: I understand that it may be lower turnout numbers, but that may be the only date those people can vote.

999
01:17:03,897 --> 01:17:06,819
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't know that, but I think it's really important to have.

1000
01:17:07,039 --> 01:17:11,102
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's something we have had in the past that people, you know, they may have voted that way.

1001
01:17:11,122 --> 01:17:15,204
[SPEAKER_14]: They may have voted on Saturday two years ago, and they're counting on voting on Saturday this year.

1002
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:17,546
[SPEAKER_14]: And to find out they can't, they may have missed their window.

1003
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:18,887
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just want to add to that.

1004
01:17:19,593 --> 01:17:23,876
[SPEAKER_14]: So a motion from Councilor Knight to receive and place a file seconded by Vice President Bears.

1005
01:17:24,696 --> 01:17:25,757
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1006
01:17:26,998 --> 01:17:27,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Bears?

1007
01:17:27,878 --> 01:17:27,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1008
01:17:28,919 --> 01:17:29,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Caraviello?

1009
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:29,960
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1010
01:17:30,580 --> 01:17:31,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Collins?

1011
01:17:31,741 --> 01:17:31,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1012
01:17:34,163 --> 01:17:34,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Knight?

1013
01:17:34,943 --> 01:17:35,263
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1014
01:17:35,623 --> 01:17:36,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1015
01:17:36,644 --> 01:17:36,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1016
01:17:37,124 --> 01:17:37,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Tseng?

1017
01:17:38,505 --> 01:17:38,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1018
01:17:39,606 --> 01:17:40,126
[SPEAKER_04]: President Morell?

1019
01:17:40,347 --> 01:17:40,567
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1020
01:17:40,767 --> 01:17:42,908
[SPEAKER_14]: Seven in favor, zero negative, the motion passes.

1021
01:17:43,389 --> 01:17:44,129
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was 324 and 325 together.

1022
01:17:44,189 --> 01:17:44,689
[SPEAKER_14]: We do also have 326.

1023
01:17:51,592 --> 01:17:59,254
[SPEAKER_14]: So page paper 3.6 is just a listing of, you know, we're open seats for the 20 June 1st 2023.

1024
01:17:59,454 --> 01:18:03,634
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, the date of submission is June 1st.

1025
01:18:03,654 --> 01:18:12,636
[SPEAKER_14]: So the municipal election open seats for 2023 is City Council, seven seats, two year term, Mayor, one seat, two year term, and school committee, six seats, two years term.

1026
01:18:12,856 --> 01:18:13,516
[SPEAKER_05]: President.

1027
01:18:17,950 --> 01:18:19,571
[SPEAKER_02]: just wanted to add a couple questions.

1028
01:18:19,652 --> 01:18:25,377
[SPEAKER_02]: This is separate from the call to election, which you're gonna put before us at a later date to put this on the ballot.

1029
01:18:26,378 --> 01:18:27,399
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1030
01:18:28,399 --> 01:18:33,224
[SPEAKER_02]: And sorry, I didn't ask it when you were talking about vote by mail, just a little bit ago.

1031
01:18:34,185 --> 01:18:42,632
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had a relationship with the post office in Medford around vote by mail, the last few elections, given the just sheer volume.

1032
01:18:43,593 --> 01:18:45,774
[SPEAKER_02]: in 2020, 2021, and 2022.

1033
01:18:46,455 --> 01:18:48,276
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the status of that relationship?

1034
01:18:49,937 --> 01:18:53,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Is everything going to be in place for September and November?

1035
01:18:53,779 --> 01:18:57,281
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, how has that been going with the census?

1036
01:18:57,321 --> 01:19:02,765
[SPEAKER_02]: We touched on it last time we talked, but I just wanted to check on those two things really quick.

1037
01:19:03,285 --> 01:19:03,505
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

1038
01:19:03,525 --> 01:19:09,969
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have met with both the supervisor and the manager at the post office.

1039
01:19:10,009 --> 01:19:13,031
[SPEAKER_09]: I met with them two weeks ago just to discuss what our needs were.

1040
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:22,115
[SPEAKER_09]: The election calendar went out to them today just so that they're aware of when we're going to be sending things out and when we want to accept things in.

1041
01:19:24,337 --> 01:19:25,658
[SPEAKER_09]: The gentleman's name is Brian.

1042
01:19:25,698 --> 01:19:27,339
[SPEAKER_09]: Brian will be working closely with us.

1043
01:19:27,759 --> 01:19:39,426
[SPEAKER_09]: We will have ID badges so that when we go over to the post office, the only people that can pick up elections materials will be someone in our office that has an ID badge and they're aware of those requirements.

1044
01:19:40,867 --> 01:19:42,388
[SPEAKER_09]: When it comes to sending mail out,

1045
01:19:43,161 --> 01:19:48,305
[SPEAKER_09]: We do now have these green tags that designate the envelopes as ballots.

1046
01:19:48,785 --> 01:19:53,788
[SPEAKER_09]: Those are used across the state to ensure that the ballots are processed faster than other mail.

1047
01:19:54,369 --> 01:19:57,110
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is something that was not in place and is now in place.

1048
01:19:57,451 --> 01:20:05,556
[SPEAKER_09]: So what happens is, when we send ballots out, we wrap these green tags around the ballots, bring them to the post office, and they get processed more quickly.

1049
01:20:07,397 --> 01:20:07,698
[SPEAKER_09]: Henry?

1050
01:20:08,641 --> 01:20:13,944
[SPEAKER_09]: and the other commissioners will be assisting us when it comes to going to the post office if we need that.

1051
01:20:14,404 --> 01:20:22,147
[SPEAKER_09]: The idea is that we should be able to do that ourselves within the office, within the, you know, just making sure we have coverage in the office and getting the balance.

1052
01:20:22,868 --> 01:20:23,568
[SPEAKER_09]: Does that answer?

1053
01:20:23,708 --> 01:20:27,210
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and just that arrangement's in place for the city census as well?

1054
01:20:27,230 --> 01:20:27,850
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, correct.

1055
01:20:27,890 --> 01:20:27,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1056
01:20:28,170 --> 01:20:36,534
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep, it is all in place, and what we're doing is we're also prepping for the March election so the post office is aware of what our needs are for March as well.

1057
01:20:36,954 --> 01:20:37,655
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thank you.

1058
01:20:38,671 --> 01:20:40,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I bring up two things?

1059
01:20:40,592 --> 01:20:52,259
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if it's appropriate or not, but I just want to make a reminder that the 13th, along with what we're talking about, the positions, the 13th is the day that nomination papers will be available in our office.

1060
01:20:52,699 --> 01:20:58,023
[SPEAKER_09]: It's room 102, so please pass the word if people are going to be running for office to stop in.

1061
01:20:58,603 --> 01:21:02,105
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing is... I'm sorry?

1062
01:21:02,165 --> 01:21:03,386
[SPEAKER_09]: They close on the 28th of July.

1063
01:21:07,249 --> 01:21:10,311
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the last date to pull papers?

1064
01:21:10,571 --> 01:21:12,893
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the last day to submit papers to our office.

1065
01:21:12,993 --> 01:21:15,295
[SPEAKER_09]: The papers will be certified by August 8th.

1066
01:21:15,555 --> 01:21:16,516
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the last day to pull?

1067
01:21:17,296 --> 01:21:18,137
[SPEAKER_09]: The last day to pull?

1068
01:21:18,817 --> 01:21:20,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Hold on, let me look at my notes here.

1069
01:21:21,459 --> 01:21:22,160
[SPEAKER_09]: I apologize.

1070
01:21:25,262 --> 01:21:27,043
[SPEAKER_09]: Ah, come on.

1071
01:21:28,104 --> 01:21:30,165
[SPEAKER_09]: The last day to pick up nomination papers is July 21st.

1072
01:21:32,662 --> 01:21:46,174
[SPEAKER_09]: As a reminder with regards to nomination papers, I just want to make sure that everybody remembers that if they have not returned their census, they need to return the postcard in order to be eligible to sign nomination papers.

1073
01:21:48,115 --> 01:21:52,039
[SPEAKER_09]: We've sent out the mailing for the inactive voters for the census.

1074
01:21:52,099 --> 01:21:55,261
[SPEAKER_09]: We just want to make sure people understand they have to sign something.

1075
01:21:55,642 --> 01:21:56,883
[SPEAKER_09]: Otherwise, when they go to the polls,

1076
01:21:57,584 --> 01:21:57,744
[SPEAKER_07]: on the

1077
01:22:18,812 --> 01:22:26,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Now historically, up until Sandy Gale became the elections manager, we never had this issue with the census and with people getting pulled from the list and everything else.

1078
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:28,200
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a nightmare ever since.

1079
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:30,181
[SPEAKER_07]: It's created a ton of problems in this community.

1080
01:22:30,521 --> 01:22:32,843
[SPEAKER_07]: We've had people coming up here saying the elections have been raked.

1081
01:22:32,923 --> 01:22:43,131
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember Richard Brady Daugherty up here screaming and yelling saying that the elections raked and Zach Baer's fault because he talked to Sandy and they were colluding to remove people from the rolls and everything else.

1082
01:22:44,172 --> 01:22:46,933
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a bad practice, you know, it didn't have that didn't happen.

1083
01:22:46,973 --> 01:22:55,475
[SPEAKER_07]: But that was the that was the general consensus throughout the community was that, you know, Zach was running around trying to control the voting.

1084
01:22:55,795 --> 01:23:06,158
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, what I'm saying is, why don't we cool it on that a little bit, relax a little bit, because it does create a situation where a lot of people get frustrated and it creates voter apathy, where they don't want to come out and vote.

1085
01:23:06,698 --> 01:23:10,419
[SPEAKER_07]: and they don't want to go and waste their time going through this ordeal of this.

1086
01:23:10,699 --> 01:23:16,101
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the elections are great, but they're overwhelmed when they get in there and they got one person that says, what do you mean I can't vote?

1087
01:23:16,301 --> 01:23:18,802
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, listen, I just talked to 4,000 people that can and you can't.

1088
01:23:18,902 --> 01:23:20,062
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, sorry, what do you want me to tell you guys?

1089
01:23:20,082 --> 01:23:22,783
[SPEAKER_07]: Today's the biggest day of the year for me, right?

1090
01:23:22,943 --> 01:23:24,363
[SPEAKER_07]: And they don't get the attention that they deserve.

1091
01:23:24,383 --> 01:23:27,004
[SPEAKER_07]: And then they have to come down to city hall and go back and go back to the back.

1092
01:23:27,264 --> 01:23:27,964
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not going to vote.

1093
01:23:27,984 --> 01:23:29,105
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just not going to do it.

1094
01:23:29,665 --> 01:23:32,986
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'll reiterate the fact, I don't think it's the best practice.

1095
01:23:33,646 --> 01:23:35,887
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it might be what you're required to do, what you can do.

1096
01:23:35,907 --> 01:23:38,348
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's what you can do, not necessarily what you're required to do.

1097
01:23:38,908 --> 01:23:43,709
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't think that it's working in favor of promoting full involvement in elections.

1098
01:23:44,110 --> 01:23:44,690
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Newton.

1099
01:23:44,710 --> 01:23:46,230
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's an important point, but I want to make sure.

1100
01:23:46,270 --> 01:23:49,731
[SPEAKER_14]: So you're talking about signing papers specifically?

1101
01:23:49,751 --> 01:23:50,392
[SPEAKER_14]: Correct.

1102
01:23:50,612 --> 01:23:50,692
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

1103
01:23:50,712 --> 01:23:53,133
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to make sure that people are active voters.

1104
01:23:54,781 --> 01:23:57,943
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't mind, I would love to explain to you the process.

1105
01:23:58,823 --> 01:24:02,946
[SPEAKER_09]: We are required by law to send the census out.

1106
01:24:02,986 --> 01:24:08,529
[SPEAKER_09]: By June 15th, we are required to inactivate voters who have not returned their census.

1107
01:24:09,009 --> 01:24:18,054
[SPEAKER_09]: We've moved our timeframe up so that we have plenty of time to let people know through the postcards that they needed to let us know that they're still living in Medford.

1108
01:24:19,446 --> 01:24:23,831
[SPEAKER_07]: example, like I have to fill out a census, I'm on the ballot, and I gotta fill out a census every year.

1109
01:24:23,971 --> 01:24:25,674
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can't vote for myself if I don't.

1110
01:24:26,074 --> 01:24:26,555
[SPEAKER_07]: This is crazy.

1111
01:24:26,575 --> 01:24:30,379
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't sign my own nomination papers if I don't fill out the census, but I'm an elected official in the community.

1112
01:24:30,660 --> 01:24:32,883
[SPEAKER_07]: To be an elected official, I believe I have to be a registered voter.

1113
01:24:33,543 --> 01:24:33,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

1114
01:24:33,824 --> 01:24:36,247
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm not a registered voter right now because I didn't fill out the census.

1115
01:24:36,607 --> 01:24:37,767
[SPEAKER_09]: No, there's a difference.

1116
01:24:37,947 --> 01:24:39,148
[SPEAKER_07]: I apologize.

1117
01:24:39,508 --> 01:24:42,469
[SPEAKER_09]: So an active voter simply means you haven't returned your census.

1118
01:24:42,569 --> 01:24:48,851
[SPEAKER_09]: And we do everything in our power to make sure that any inactive voters are notified that they're inactive.

1119
01:24:49,511 --> 01:24:55,253
[SPEAKER_09]: And that when they go to the polls, we may try and make it as easy as possible for them to be able to just show their ID and vote.

1120
01:24:55,674 --> 01:24:56,314
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1121
01:24:56,394 --> 01:24:59,335
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I'm saying is that the past practice was never like this.

1122
01:24:59,375 --> 01:25:02,656
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was always very, it was always a lot easier than what's going on now.

1123
01:25:04,100 --> 01:25:06,642
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if this is the way it's going to be, this is the way it's going to be, that's fine.

1124
01:25:07,283 --> 01:25:12,708
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just saying that I don't think it's necessarily conducive to promoting full involvement in elections.

1125
01:25:14,189 --> 01:25:14,449
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1126
01:25:16,551 --> 01:25:17,832
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice President Paris.

1127
01:25:18,693 --> 01:25:30,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little concerned because what I'm hearing is if people didn't fill out their census and they sign a nomination form, then those signatures will not be valid for the purposes of nomination.

1128
01:25:31,283 --> 01:25:32,643
[SPEAKER_09]: That is my understanding correct.

1129
01:25:33,623 --> 01:25:35,904
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, go ahead.

1130
01:25:35,944 --> 01:25:37,164
[SPEAKER_09]: You can ask your question.

1131
01:25:37,784 --> 01:25:41,125
[SPEAKER_02]: How many census forms went out and how many have been returned?

1132
01:25:41,345 --> 01:25:44,185
[SPEAKER_09]: 23,000 census forms were sent out to the households in Medford.

1133
01:25:45,025 --> 01:25:47,586
[SPEAKER_09]: We have received back about 17,000.

1134
01:25:48,106 --> 01:25:47,586
17,000?

1135
01:25:50,006 --> 01:25:54,567
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, we sent another 15,000 cards out to registered voters.

1136
01:25:55,087 --> 01:26:00,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of those cards come back as PO returns because the people have moved and they haven't notified us.

1137
01:26:00,966 --> 01:26:03,808
[SPEAKER_09]: We are following up as quickly as we can.

1138
01:26:04,528 --> 01:26:07,590
[SPEAKER_09]: We've received about 4,000 returns on the postcards to date.

1139
01:26:08,751 --> 01:26:10,312
[SPEAKER_09]: So, and we're still having them come in.

1140
01:26:10,672 --> 01:26:13,754
[SPEAKER_09]: And people can, the cards can come in any time.

1141
01:26:13,774 --> 01:26:16,636
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's no drop dead date for the cards.

1142
01:26:16,676 --> 01:26:20,379
[SPEAKER_09]: We just would like to have the cards sent in before the September election.

1143
01:26:21,553 --> 01:26:25,857
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it, so you're expecting most people who are active voters now will be active voters on June 16th?

1144
01:26:26,238 --> 01:26:26,838
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely.

1145
01:26:27,058 --> 01:26:35,367
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, could you just communicate that number to us to let us know how many people were inactivated once that's completed?

1146
01:26:36,928 --> 01:26:38,790
[SPEAKER_09]: So people have already been inactivated.

1147
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:44,816
[SPEAKER_09]: So if they didn't send their census in by April 25th, we then sent out postcards to 15,000 people.

1148
01:26:46,671 --> 01:26:49,493
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've gotten back about 4,000 postcards.

1149
01:26:49,593 --> 01:26:52,876
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're still working on getting them in.

1150
01:26:53,236 --> 01:26:54,557
[SPEAKER_09]: We process them every day.

1151
01:26:54,937 --> 01:26:58,681
[SPEAKER_09]: We did go to the post office to check and make sure that the post office was sending them to us.

1152
01:26:59,321 --> 01:27:04,445
[SPEAKER_09]: We made sure that we had all our business reply mail money in place so that the postcards aren't delayed at all.

1153
01:27:05,026 --> 01:27:13,553
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could just at whatever point you feel, either if it's June 16th or before then, communicate to the council through the clerk and the president.

1154
01:27:15,351 --> 01:27:20,813
[SPEAKER_02]: how many, what percentage of registered voters in the city are active versus inactive and how many were made inactive this year?

1155
01:27:20,833 --> 01:27:26,114
[SPEAKER_02]: The percentage, it could be the actual number, it could be both, but you know.

1156
01:27:26,474 --> 01:27:28,815
[SPEAKER_09]: So about 15,000 voters were made inactive.

1157
01:27:29,015 --> 01:27:30,075
[SPEAKER_02]: And how many voters are there?

1158
01:27:30,095 --> 01:27:32,156
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knight.

1159
01:27:32,356 --> 01:27:33,076
[SPEAKER_07]: How many voters are there?

1160
01:27:33,096 --> 01:27:37,017
[SPEAKER_09]: There are, so there are.

1161
01:27:37,857 --> 01:27:38,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Including the 15,000 hit the road.

1162
01:27:41,024 --> 01:27:42,424
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have the number in front of me.

1163
01:27:42,504 --> 01:27:45,245
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to quote a number that I would give you incorrectly.

1164
01:27:45,265 --> 01:27:47,866
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a third that you threw out, right?

1165
01:27:47,906 --> 01:27:48,286
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

1166
01:27:48,306 --> 01:27:51,227
[SPEAKER_07]: So like 33% of the registered voters are no longer, are inactive now.

1167
01:27:51,367 --> 01:27:51,687
[SPEAKER_07]: They're inactive.

1168
01:27:51,707 --> 01:27:52,887
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they didn't send back a census.

1169
01:27:52,927 --> 01:27:54,768
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's 4,000 that have sent it in.

1170
01:27:54,928 --> 01:27:56,048
[SPEAKER_09]: So we've reduced that.

1171
01:27:56,068 --> 01:27:56,448
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, right.

1172
01:27:56,468 --> 01:28:02,310
[SPEAKER_07]: But I mean, ultimately, you took a third of the population from inactive.

1173
01:28:02,350 --> 01:28:05,011
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct, as required.

1174
01:28:05,031 --> 01:28:06,211
[SPEAKER_07]: A third of the voting population, 33%.

1175
01:28:06,451 --> 01:28:08,692
[SPEAKER_09]: As required by a law, yes.

1176
01:28:08,892 --> 01:28:09,292
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy.

1177
01:28:12,218 --> 01:28:15,020
[SPEAKER_02]: So there were 15,000 who hadn't returned, who were registered.

1178
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they returned their postcards, so it's down to 11,000?

1179
01:28:18,102 --> 01:28:18,482
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

1180
01:28:18,802 --> 01:28:19,082
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1181
01:28:19,362 --> 01:28:19,703
[SPEAKER_09]: Correct.

1182
01:28:20,863 --> 01:28:30,649
[SPEAKER_09]: And just to give you a perspective, Somerville, when we inactivated our folks, they had a 30% return rate on their census.

1183
01:28:30,689 --> 01:28:32,350
[SPEAKER_09]: So our census was higher than that.

1184
01:28:32,750 --> 01:28:37,333
[SPEAKER_07]: My experience with Somerville have always been they make things very difficult for anybody to do anything over there.

1185
01:28:38,654 --> 01:28:39,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Fair enough.

1186
01:28:41,403 --> 01:28:46,485
[SPEAKER_14]: And does SARA follow a similar policy as far as how quickly they inactivate people?

1187
01:28:46,925 --> 01:28:47,145
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1188
01:28:47,485 --> 01:28:47,645
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1189
01:28:47,785 --> 01:28:50,646
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody has to be inactivated by early June.

1190
01:28:51,146 --> 01:28:53,327
[SPEAKER_09]: And what I did- What happens if they're not?

1191
01:28:53,587 --> 01:28:54,567
[SPEAKER_07]: Do they turn into a pumpkin?

1192
01:28:55,407 --> 01:28:57,908
[SPEAKER_09]: If they're not inactivated, we're not in compliance.

1193
01:28:58,228 --> 01:28:58,828
[SPEAKER_07]: And then what happens?

1194
01:29:01,349 --> 01:29:03,330
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know what the state does if we're not in compliance.

1195
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:09,912
[SPEAKER_09]: I just would prefer to be in compliance because I think it's important that we follow the rules that are given to us.

1196
01:29:10,812 --> 01:29:12,493
[SPEAKER_09]: to uphold the integrity of the election.

1197
01:29:13,053 --> 01:29:19,615
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand your frustration with the- I mean, you can't just throw a third of the people in the community off the voter rolls.

1198
01:29:19,635 --> 01:29:20,815
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to say that they can still vote?

1199
01:29:20,835 --> 01:29:22,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen, you made them inactive voters.

1200
01:29:22,195 --> 01:29:24,296
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to show up at the polls and they're going to say, no, you can't vote.

1201
01:29:24,636 --> 01:29:26,657
[SPEAKER_07]: Go stand in the corner and fill it out in the bad boy booth.

1202
01:29:27,177 --> 01:29:27,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Right?

1203
01:29:27,497 --> 01:29:28,537
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's what happens, right?

1204
01:29:28,677 --> 01:29:31,078
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's hard enough to get people to want to participate.

1205
01:29:31,178 --> 01:29:32,578
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just think that this is a failed policy.

1206
01:29:32,598 --> 01:29:34,099
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not your policy.

1207
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:35,179
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a failed policy.

1208
01:29:35,199 --> 01:29:36,979
[SPEAKER_07]: You're saying it's to comply with the state law.

1209
01:29:36,999 --> 01:29:38,160
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that doesn't make any sense.

1210
01:29:38,220 --> 01:29:38,660
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy.

1211
01:29:39,340 --> 01:29:44,082
[SPEAKER_07]: It's crazy if you fall off the, if you don't fill out your census form, but they not send you an excise tax bill, pretty sure they do.

1212
01:29:44,102 --> 01:29:45,323
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

1213
01:29:45,663 --> 01:29:46,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty sure they do.

1214
01:29:46,303 --> 01:29:49,905
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're going to take away your right to have a voice, but they're still going to tax you.

1215
01:29:50,005 --> 01:29:58,408
[SPEAKER_09]: One thing that we've, one thing that we have implemented in order to make the affirmations for inactive voters easier is we just have a roster.

1216
01:29:58,789 --> 01:30:06,752
[SPEAKER_09]: So people are just, you know, there's four boxes, sign your name, what's your address and write your hand, write your name so that we know who you are.

1217
01:30:07,668 --> 01:30:13,810
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes it much faster than having people fill out two or three forms, which is why there has been past practice.

1218
01:30:15,031 --> 01:30:19,192
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll continue to- That was the past practice beginning within the last 36 months.

1219
01:30:20,693 --> 01:30:22,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we'll continue to approve that process.

1220
01:30:23,174 --> 01:30:23,514
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1221
01:30:23,534 --> 01:30:29,836
[SPEAKER_14]: So we have a motion from Councilor Knight to receive and place on file, seconded by- Second.

1222
01:30:30,837 --> 01:30:33,538
[SPEAKER_14]: Vice Mayor Bears, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1223
01:30:39,046 --> 01:30:39,346
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1224
01:30:39,366 --> 01:30:39,827
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1225
01:30:39,847 --> 01:30:39,947
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1226
01:30:40,047 --> 01:30:40,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1227
01:30:40,167 --> 01:30:40,287
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1228
01:30:40,307 --> 01:30:40,547
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1229
01:30:40,567 --> 01:30:40,727
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1230
01:30:40,827 --> 01:30:40,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1231
01:31:00,847 --> 01:31:10,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Madam President, there's a paper that I submitted to be included in the record this evening, pursuant to communications from city offices and employees, which is the section of the agenda that we're into this evening.

1232
01:31:13,191 --> 01:31:14,812
[SPEAKER_14]: What am I skipping something.

1233
01:31:16,876 --> 01:31:19,278
[SPEAKER_07]: I received a correspondence today from the firefighters union.

1234
01:31:20,319 --> 01:31:25,243
[SPEAKER_07]: And at our last meeting, I believe that I do have the right to initiate a point of personal privilege.

1235
01:31:26,944 --> 01:31:30,147
[SPEAKER_07]: The mayor told me that I was being distruthful at the meeting the other night.

1236
01:31:30,787 --> 01:31:42,297
[SPEAKER_07]: And this was the same meeting that the mayor said that she was very close to settling all the union contracts and that they were doing a great job and they were this close to settling all the contracts, including the fire contract.

1237
01:31:43,017 --> 01:31:49,264
[SPEAKER_07]: And this evening, Madam President, in our mailboxes before the meeting, we received a correspondence from the fire union.

1238
01:31:50,485 --> 01:31:54,430
[SPEAKER_07]: And what it says is this administration has been in office for three years and five months.

1239
01:31:55,731 --> 01:32:01,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Local 1033, I'm sorry, local 1032, which is the Metro Firefighters Union, has been without a contract for 706 days.

1240
01:32:04,993 --> 01:32:12,717
[SPEAKER_07]: The mayor spoke last week about how well negotiations were going with the fire department and that we were close to settling a contract.

1241
01:32:14,999 --> 01:32:15,839
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to repeat that.

1242
01:32:16,960 --> 01:32:23,463
[SPEAKER_07]: The mayor spoke last week about how well negotiations were going with the fire department and that we were close to settling a contract.

1243
01:32:24,944 --> 01:32:25,625
[SPEAKER_07]: That was clear, right?

1244
01:32:26,485 --> 01:32:27,265
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what the mayor said?

1245
01:32:27,486 --> 01:32:27,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1246
01:32:28,126 --> 01:32:29,227
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, this is what the union says.

1247
01:32:29,247 --> 01:32:33,029
[SPEAKER_07]: This could not be any further from the truth.

1248
01:32:34,241 --> 01:32:43,727
[SPEAKER_07]: the city is proposing in their budget double digit percentage raises to their non-union employees while unions in the city go years without a contract.

1249
01:32:45,789 --> 01:32:53,554
[SPEAKER_07]: We have new hires to this day who still do not have health insurance through the city of Medford because of administrative errors.

1250
01:32:54,514 --> 01:32:59,718
[SPEAKER_07]: The mayor's office represented that everybody was covered and that this problem was resolved.

1251
01:33:05,437 --> 01:33:16,165
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another thing in this letter that I'd like to point out, Madam President, and that's that in this budget that the mayor has proposed, they're cutting two more firefighter positions.

1252
01:33:17,106 --> 01:33:21,970
[SPEAKER_07]: At the same time, the mayor is putting out press releases boasting how the city of Medford is one of the fastest growing communities in the country.

1253
01:33:25,313 --> 01:33:28,115
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have a communication here from employees of this city.

1254
01:33:30,337 --> 01:33:32,258
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd ask that they be included in the record, Madam President.

1255
01:33:32,879 --> 01:33:33,939
[SPEAKER_07]: It was addressed to this council.

1256
01:33:35,250 --> 01:33:37,832
[SPEAKER_07]: It's highlighting issues and concerns that were brought up at last week's meeting.

1257
01:33:39,053 --> 01:33:46,259
[SPEAKER_07]: And it addresses certain things that were said, and I think that it should be included as part of the record and ask my council colleagues to support me and having this letter included as part of the record.

1258
01:33:47,320 --> 01:33:49,502
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

1259
01:33:49,562 --> 01:33:59,030
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we have a motion from Councilor Knight to include this letter in the record seconded by Vice President Beyers.

1260
01:33:59,070 --> 01:34:01,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1261
01:34:07,141 --> 01:34:07,381
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1262
01:34:07,481 --> 01:34:07,761
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1263
01:34:07,881 --> 01:34:08,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1264
01:34:09,122 --> 01:34:09,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1265
01:34:09,382 --> 01:34:10,962
[SPEAKER_04]: Public participation.

1266
01:34:11,022 --> 01:34:16,764
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have some folks here from the HR Commission would like to speak.

1267
01:34:36,785 --> 01:34:39,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Milva McDonald, 61 Monument Street.

1268
01:34:39,748 --> 01:34:41,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for allowing me to speak tonight.

1269
01:34:43,091 --> 01:34:45,334
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the chair of the Medford Charter Study Committee.

1270
01:34:45,834 --> 01:34:56,044
[SPEAKER_08]: As you know, charter review has been discussed in Medford for many years, and we are at an exciting moment right now with volunteer residents undertaking the task.

1271
01:34:56,705 --> 01:34:57,206
[SPEAKER_08]: As we work

1272
01:34:57,826 --> 01:35:06,717
[SPEAKER_08]: with the Collins Center for Public Management, a nonprofit entity out of UMass Boston that has guided many communities through the process of charter review.

1273
01:35:07,278 --> 01:35:16,269
[SPEAKER_08]: We are examining the charter as a whole and learning, among other things, about how pieces interact with each other, best practices, and trends.

1274
01:35:17,419 --> 01:35:25,042
[SPEAKER_08]: The goal is to propose a sturdy, fair, transparent charter that provides a strong framework for our city government in the long term.

1275
01:35:26,563 --> 01:35:33,246
[SPEAKER_08]: This holistic look at the charter is especially important in Medford because of how much time has passed since the last review.

1276
01:35:34,186 --> 01:35:41,750
[SPEAKER_08]: As the blueprint for how our city government operates, the charter is a vitally important document that affects every person who lives in our city.

1277
01:35:42,845 --> 01:36:00,802
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, for the first time in decades, we are finally giving it a checkup, looking at our form of government, the balance of powers, the composition of our elected bodies, length and limits of terms for elected officials, budget procedures, mechanisms for citizen participation, and more.

1278
01:36:02,003 --> 01:36:09,088
[SPEAKER_08]: I have heard this council reiterate many times that charter review should come from the people, and that is exactly what is happening.

1279
01:36:09,789 --> 01:36:14,032
[SPEAKER_08]: We are all residents who volunteered for this task because we care about our city.

1280
01:36:14,913 --> 01:36:18,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Our process prioritizes community engagement and input.

1281
01:36:18,856 --> 01:36:23,079
[SPEAKER_08]: We will use the public feedback we collect to draft a proposal

1282
01:36:23,519 --> 01:36:29,325
[SPEAKER_08]: that must make its way through several portals, including this council, before ever becoming official.

1283
01:36:29,965 --> 01:36:33,028
[SPEAKER_08]: The final step is at the ballot box with the voters.

1284
01:36:33,629 --> 01:36:36,372
[SPEAKER_08]: The voters, the people, will have the final say.

1285
01:36:37,652 --> 01:36:47,661
[SPEAKER_08]: Our webpage at www.medfordmad.org slash charter study has a wealth of information, including a form inviting public feedback.

1286
01:36:48,522 --> 01:36:53,866
[SPEAKER_08]: You will find us at Circle the Square in June, the Farmer's Market in August, and other events around the city.

1287
01:36:54,605 --> 01:36:57,068
[SPEAKER_08]: We will also be circulating a survey very soon.

1288
01:36:58,169 --> 01:37:00,892
[SPEAKER_08]: But the main reason I'm here is to extend an invitation.

1289
01:37:01,392 --> 01:37:09,221
[SPEAKER_08]: We are especially excited about our first public information and listening session this Thursday, June 8th at 7 p.m.

1290
01:37:09,541 --> 01:37:11,423
[SPEAKER_08]: right here in City Hall Chambers.

1291
01:37:12,244 --> 01:37:14,467

1292
01:37:14,967 --> 01:37:15,688
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be fun.

1293
01:37:16,869 --> 01:37:20,552
[SPEAKER_08]: regardless of which are events or meetings you can or cannot attend.

1294
01:37:21,092 --> 01:37:31,440
[SPEAKER_08]: Your voice is important, and we want to hear from you, the residents of our city and the leaders of our city about your thoughts, hopes and dreams for our municipal government.

1295
01:37:32,100 --> 01:37:34,542
[SPEAKER_08]: We hope to see you on Thursday evening right here.

01:37:45,767 --> 01:37:47,467
[SPEAKER_14]: either in person or on Zoom.

1300
01:37:53,168 --> 01:38:02,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a motion to take 22-514 the outdoor dining ordinance off the table and approve for third reading.
