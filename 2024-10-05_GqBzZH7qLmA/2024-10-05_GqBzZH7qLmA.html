    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=131.893s">Yes,</a>  I'm in the affirmative, so your motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=134.276s">I</a>  will go to Vice President Bears for a brief synopsis of the paper before us for this public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=139.304s">Vice</a>  President Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=140.265s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=141.727s">I</a>  believe this is the sixth public meeting we've now had on these items. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=146.414s">These</a>  are three amendments proposed to the city charter that with the approval of the council and the approval of the mayor would be submitted to the voters in November for their approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=157.839s">This</a>  first amendment would provide the city council with the authority to employ staff for research and legal consulting as needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=169.764s">The</a>  second one would <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=172.263s">create</a>  a better budget plan and better budget process for the city of Medford by setting a formal date by which the mayor would be required to submit the annual budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=182.875s">The</a>  City Council would also have a formal date by which it would have to approve or otherwise act on the mayor's budget proposal, and it would also allow the City Council to have a real role in the budget process by reallocating funds between line items. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=199.523s">Right</a>  now, the City Council can only approve a whole budget, reject a whole budget, or cut specific line items. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=205.506s">This</a>  would make the City Council a partner in the budget process. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=209.55s">But</a>  the city council could not increase the budget above the mayor's proposal. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=214.642s">So</a>  those are the three amendments of the third amendment sorry the third amendment would. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=219.233s">make</a>  appointees of the mayor to municipal boards, committees, and commissions created by city ordinance or by state law, subject to confirmation of the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=228.577s">Right</a>  now, the city council does not confirm any nominees to the boards, committees, and commissions that are created by ordinance or state law, unless otherwise required by the ordinance or by state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=240.563s">So</a>  those are the three. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=241.744s">I</a>  won't do the summary on the next two. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=244.905s">Save</a>  us some time on that.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=246.466s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=246.966s">And</a>  I know there were some questions the last time for any amendments from legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=252.567s">Are</a>  those included in what is on the agenda or is that something you need to make on the floor?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=256.408s">Yes,</a>  the language reflects the motion from our May 9th meeting to incorporate the specific language changes from legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=264.09s">And</a>  those were also, those changes are also in our packets this past weekend as a red line copy and were also sent out to Councilors about a month ago when they came in from Attorney Goldberg.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=276.868s">So</a>  as this is a public hearing, I will take each, I will go to, sorry, we'll go to Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=281.591s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=283.553s">Apologies,</a>  President Brown. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=284.394s">I'm</a>  happy for you to open the meeting first.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=289.157s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=290.458s">So</a>  as this is a public hearing, I'll take these papers one by one. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=293.38s">So</a>  we have paper 23-097. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=295.221s">So</a>  this is the appointments by city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=300.797s">enable</a>  the city council with many stipulations to secure legal services either by employment or on a contractual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=307.479s">Such</a>  legal services shall be solely in the service of the council and make good research analysis drafting drafting assistance. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=316.382s">Was</a>  it anyone who would like me to read the full proposed amendments? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=320.523s">Okay,</a>  so we'll open this portion of the public hearing if there is anyone who would like to speak in favor <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=327.233s">of</a>  paper 23-097, either on Zoom or in person. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=335.076s">Seeing</a>  none, this portion of the public hearing is closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=338.198s">Is</a>  there anyone who would like to speak in opposition of paper 23-097, either in person or on Zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=348.622s">Seeing</a>  none, this portion of the public hearing is closed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=353.824s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council or do I have a motion?</p>

    <p>[Adam Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=358.597s">Motion</a>  to approve.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=359.319s">I'll</a>  start going to Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=366.194s">I'll</a>  be brief because we've held meetings on this, and I wanted to reiterate that we've done our very best to engage the public in a rigorous process with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=381.164s">And</a>  I believe that to members of the public, the item at hand is pretty clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=387.729s">I</a>  especially get that sense from emails that I've gotten from constituents, <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=393.973s">We've</a>  asked for feedback with gauge support, and we've gotten a lot of feedback in support. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=400.876s">Because</a>  this is an important vote, I wanted to quickly reiterate why I support this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=406.998s">First,</a>  I think it allows for a framework of cooperation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=410.479s">And</a>  as the mayor said in our Tuesday meeting last week, that's a goal that we, that's something that we want to aspire to. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=419.282s">from</a>  both sides. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=420.984s">And</a>  it allows for that framework through good times and bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=423.846s">Councilor</a>  Berry said something that stuck with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=427.41s">He</a>  said something along the lines of, we want to be writing the press releases with you guys, with the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=433.315s">And</a>  I just do believe that there's so much stronger of a message of political movement when we all work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=441.682s">and</a>  compromise and work together to get to a place where we like on the issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=445.865s">But</a>  it's not just about the positives. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=447.666s">I</a>  believe that these amendments allow us to shoulder the burden of governance together, to make difficult choices together, and to do so in a more public, transparent format where we can explain the choices that we make to our residents as well, which I think is gonna be important in the years coming up, especially with the fiscal cliff that we've all been talking about. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=470.099s">What</a>  these amendments offer isn't that much different from what happens in other cities and other levels of government. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=475.305s">People</a>  expect us to work together. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=476.907s">They</a>  expect the legislative branch to have a role in these things. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=481.733s">And</a>  people are actually just confused why we don't do these things the way that we're proposing already. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=489.802s">I</a>  see that in the survey results for the budget survey that I put out. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=494.443s">I</a>  believe that these amendments allow us to do our job. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=496.943s">Residents</a>  expect legislators to legislate. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=499.744s">It's</a>  the central mission of our job and it's in the name. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=503.524s">To</a>  all the residents who wonder why we don't move faster on issues, I believe while a lot of it is a need for process, a lot of it is also the lack of staff and researchers that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=515.867s">These</a>  amendments allow us to <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=518.227s">make</a>  it help us to help you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=520.509s">They</a>  help us to do our job. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=522.532s">I</a>  think that these amendments I'm going to close off here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=525.234s">But</a>  by saying that, I think these amendments allow us to plan and longer term and increase transparency, it moves up the calendar. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=534.684s">and</a>  I know that this is a stated goal of everyone on the city council and the mayor said that as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=541.788s">I</a>  think a prime example is in soliciting feedback from residents this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=547.051s">I</a>  think I have really <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=549.773s">I</a>  think we've all talked about after school child care before on the council, but it is something that we need to tackle as a city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=555.059s">And</a>  if we were able to engage residents at an earlier time, and we had more of a public facing process where the legislative could help the executive do that too, we would be able to <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=568.092s">find</a>  a way to address it or start to address it in the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=571.214s">And</a>  so I think, you know, there are literally litany of reasons why I think everyone should support these amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=576.277s">But</a>  I think Councilor Bears for all the work that he's put into this, I think the rest of the council for being so patient and for for entertaining

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=586.664s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=590.437s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=593.26s">I'm</a>  excited that we've gotten to the point tonight where we get to vote on these. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=596.723s">I</a>  thank Vice President Bears for noting that this is the sixth time that we've been able to meet and discuss these in public meetings so far this year and have the floor open for public comment and questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=608.934s">But</a>  at the same time, you know, I want to reinforce for folks who are watching this meeting that this is the beginning of a process, not the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=616.22s">You</a>  know, should these pass, this would be no different from putting, for example, a debt exclusion on the ballot or putting a CPA amendment on the ballot, as was done several years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=624.668s">This</a>  leads it up to the voters to continue to discuss and consider and then place individual <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=631.313s">votes</a>  on these individual amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=633.995s">I've</a>  said this before, but just to reiterate, you know, I think that these amendments would be additive for this whole community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=641.522s">Administrations</a>  change, but we always deserve a council that is truly empowered to represent our community members and act on their behalf, not just be a grandstanding body, not just be a rubber stamp. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=653.451s">Right</a>  now, this council can't appropriate resources to ensure that the policies we do pass actually get enforced or if they are just left to gather dust. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=661.114s">We</a>  can't hire staff to allow us to do our work confidently or effectively or with the resources that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=666.937s">We're</a>  not empowered to really collaborate with the administration to craft budgets that reflect what we hear from our constituents. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=673.299s">So</a>  to me, these are important because these amendments would leave the community with seven more avenues. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=678.301s">for</a>  meaningful representation in their city government, and that's really what it comes down to. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=682.806s">The</a>  community's representatives should be able to actually materially represent them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=688.431s">So</a>  this is about <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=690.413s">you</a>  know, just making some important targeted tweaks to our 40-year-old charter so that we can start working for a better community now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=697.558s">Because</a>  I think that the work we have to do, the work that we've been trying to do, will be done better and faster with these amendments with a more balanced and collaborative government. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=706.204s">And</a>  I don't think that that can wait, you know, half a decade or more to be able to work more effectively for the constituents. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=712.208s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=712.529s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=715.631s">Any</a>  further discussion from the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=718.46s">And</a>  just to reiterate, just so people, as Councilor Collins said, to make clear on the process, an affirmative vote from the council would result in this going to the mayor's desk. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=726.825s">It</a>  would then have to be approved by the mayor. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=728.886s">It</a>  would be then vetted by the attorney general to then appear on the November ballot to be voted on by the voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=735.91s">So</a>  that's the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=737.09s">So</a>  this is, as Councilor Collins says, this is a step in the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=739.812s">And</a>  if this is voted in the affirmative, nothing would change tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=742.633s">It</a>  just moves it on to the mayor's desk, then to the AG if she votes affirmative, and then to the voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=748.292s">So</a>  we have a motion from vicers and pairs to approve 23-097. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=751.414s">And</a>  again, this is appointments by the city council with regards to securing legal services either by employment or on a contractual basis. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=761.84s">Do</a>  I have a second? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=763.642s">Second.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=765.383s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=768.485s">And</a>  do you want to wait the public comment period? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=772.527s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=772.727s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=775.727s">Madam</a>  President, I'd advise against it on a matter that's as significant as enough as our charter.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=781.23s">Advise</a>  against?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=782.271s">Waving</a>  the comment.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=783.551s">Okay,</a>  we'll keep the, okay. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=785.853s">So</a>  motion to approve pending the six-day public comment period.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=916.518s">So</a>  we have a motion from Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=923.727s">to</a>  approve pending the six-day power period, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=927.168s">And</a>  again, this paper would follow the exact same process I outlined before, an approval by the council, sent to the mayor's desk, it would have to be vetted by the AG if she approves it, and then to the voters in November. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=938.211s">So</a>  on the motion of vices and fairs, as seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Luis Santos]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1341.438s">that</a>  we advertised, but we had a good meeting with the neighbors, and they're happy the way we talked.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1348.788s">This</a>  is exactly what I was hoping for. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1350.85s">So</a>  if we're looking at the conversation we had back and forth with both everybody talking in favor for you and <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1359.111s">the</a>  respect that you have for the neighbors, the neighbors they have for you, my friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1363.674s">So</a>  I would, I know we still have to move forward, but so to be clear, it's Wednesday, Fridays, and Saturdays until 12 o'clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1371.12s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1371.98s">You're</a>  welcome, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1373.041s">And</a>  then did you have specific questions for Attorney Austin?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1375.903s">Well,</a>  what the question was, if it was going to be, you know, if we were gonna deny it, <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1382.589s">you</a>  know, in what grounds do we have to deny the special permit? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1386.152s">So</a>  I think that with this resolution, I know we'll hear from the residents, but if we don't see any conflicts, I appreciate the council for being here, but we wouldn't need their involvement because that answer would be new. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1401.624s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1402.604s">Okay,</a>  and as this is a public hearing, I have to take comments in a specific order. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1405.927s">So</a>  I'm going to take comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1409.029s">in</a>  favor of the paper first, if there's, I'll open up. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1411.531s">How</a>  do you know what I'm gonna say? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1413.052s">You</a>  don't know if they're in favor or opposed?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1414.213s">You</a>  in favor?</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1414.713s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1415.354s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1415.534s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1415.954s">Yeah,</a>  it's just because it's a specific order for this type of hearing.</p>

    <p>[D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1419.337s">So</a>  name and address. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1421.018s">I'm</a>  Louise D'Antonio, 41 Dartmouth Street, which is perpendicular to Yale Street, and I've grown up in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1427.403s">I</a>  wanted to report on the meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1429.805s">Despite</a>  what some people may have thought, we had a very vigorous, respectful meeting, <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1438.317s">All</a>  people at the meeting, including the mayor's representative from the Portuguese Brazilian council was present. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1446.038s">We</a>  were able to express our ideas, our thoughts, our concerns without being held back. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1453.22s">And</a>  it was a very honest, productive meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1458.441s">We</a>  spoke about the hours, but one of the things that we all agreed upon was that <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1465.665s">That</a>  area between 1130 and one o'clock, 1.30 in the afternoon has very little enforcement, parking enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1475.627s">We</a>  also both agree that there has to be more enforcement in the evening in the parking lot at those late hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1485.03s">So</a>  we're going to try to make <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1487.969s">some</a>  contact with the police department or something. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1491.55s">I</a>  don't know how many cars are available, but if you have a problem in a specific area at a specific time, that's when you send people down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1502.733s">You</a>  don't wait until two hours later, drive down the street, see that there are no cars there, and then say, well, what's the problem? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1511.715s">So...</a>  Ms.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1513.195s">D'Antonio,</a>  if I can, I know I asked for <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1517.246s">for</a>  this meeting specifically because I didn't think that this was just the issue with just with oasis I think the enforcement was big so I recommended that we had legal counsel here, the police chief, the DPW traffic commission, I mean the traffic director as anybody else here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1539.732s">We</a>  should, I think we asked for the parking director also. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1541.652s">And</a>  the parking director.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1543.073s">We</a>  have the building commissioner here.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1545.573s">I</a>  do not see. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1546.213s">Not</a>  the building, but really is really having.</p>

    <p>[D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1548.794s">I</a>  think that's important. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1549.814s">One</a>  of the things I wanted to mention, we have no disagreement with the restaurants. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1555.035s">Not</a>  at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1556.275s">But</a>  a year ago, some residents in another part of the city complained about not being able to park on their street. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1564.076s">And</a>  then within a week, there were signs and barriers. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1568.532s">Now</a>  that's a different section of the city, but they got a response very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1574.006s">So</a>  thank you for asking for that meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1578.055s">I</a>  look forward to that.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1579.036s">Yeah,</a>  well, I'm a little disappointed because we asked him to come tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1581.877s">And</a>  that was one of the reasons wasn't just, it wasn't just the community members and the business owners to talk and glad you did. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1589.481s">But</a>  the other reason why we call this because it was concerns of other issues that I think the enforcement was bringing in the negativity of the business owners <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1598.706s">where</a>  we have to make sure that there's a plan in place, whether it's signage, whether we talk to the traffic commission, and do residents only from certain times or set up, you know, patrols in the parking lot area, and around the same time is the closing of the establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1616.606s">So</a>  this is the these are the questions I wanted to ask <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1619.809s">the</a>  the departments that are relevant to get us. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1623.491s">I</a>  agree.</p>

    <p>[D'Antonio]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1624.251s">But</a>  the thing is, you can have a lot of signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1626.132s">But</a>  if there's no enforcement, I don't science science. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1629.234s">So</a>  thank you for your time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1630.475s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1630.995s">Appreciate</a>  it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1631.815s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1632.396s">And</a>  just the resolution we had was just about legal counsel. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1635.457s">I</a>  think you may have mentioned that but they didn't put it in.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1638.119s">Okay,</a>  so I think that'll be something we'll have to follow through. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1640.94s">I</a>  think for the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1642.461s">I</a>  think the feedback that I got back from the neighbors was that, you know, really, is <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1648.104s">is</a>  giving South Method the respect that they deserve and the residents there that they deserve, and making sure that there's some sort of a plan that the administration can work with the traffic department, the chief of police, and making sure that they step up dedicated patrols if that's what's needed in the evenings. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1665.977s">But</a>  I think the piece that bothered me the most, the phone calls that I got, were the elderly neighbors that said that, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1673.482s">the</a>  blocking of the driveways. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1675.964s">And</a>  to say that it was Oasis's fault, I didn't believe that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1681.689s">I</a>  think that the issue really is having the <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1688.197s">enforcement.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1689.077s">And</a>  I think that we need to, you know, I know it's not a popular thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1693.359s">But</a>  when you throw a few tickets on a few cars, and somebody gets told because a senior citizen can't back up out of the driveway for an emergency reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1701.842s">I</a>  think that's more important to me than any anybody's uncomfortable situation of going to get their their automobile out of impound because they didn't park and <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1711.666s">a</a>  reasonable area. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1712.547s">So</a>  I think that's something down the line we need to really call for a meeting, whether it be a committee of the whole or subcommittee on public safety, and really bring the neighbors back out. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1722.995s">So</a>  thank you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1724.636s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1725.717s">Is</a>  there anyone else who would like to speak in favor of the petition? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1728.499s">And</a>  that would be the owners if you want to speak in favor once more, if you want to just come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1733.583s">So</a>  you're in favor?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1734.704s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1736.666s">Anyone</a>  else who would like to speak in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1739.792s">Seeing</a>  none, is there anyone else, anyone who would like to speak in opposition of the petition before us? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1745.954s">Please</a>  come up to the podium.</p>

    <p>[David Perella]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1748.816s">Hi,</a>  my name is David Perella. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1755.798s">I'm</a>  at 16 Yale Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1759.42s">I</a>  would just like to go on record that I do oppose this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1764.862s">And</a>  I do think, so I've heard before that <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1768.571s">you</a>  can't come up with a reason why you would deny this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1772.812s">Well,</a>  I can give you one reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1774.172s">I</a>  think you have an obligation to protect the quality of life of the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1781.394s">And</a>  it's that simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1782.414s">So</a>  I simply wanna go on record saying I do not support this and I hope that you will reconsider.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1788.055s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1790.816s">Is</a>  there anyone else who would like to speak in opposition either on Zoom or in person? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1798.851s">Seeing</a>  none portion of the public hearing is closed any further discussion from the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1804.858s">Councilor</a>  Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1806.159s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1807.861s">I</a>  would hope that I wasn't in on some of the meetings but I would hope that in the restaurant they will put some signs up for the customers to respect the neighborhood.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1818.538s">That's</a>  part of the discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1821.0s">The</a>  part of the discussion with the owners, we're going to place signs not only in the facility, but also as they walk around toward the public parking area. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1829.828s">And</a>  I believe it's going to be in a few different languages, just for our Portuguese speaking patrons. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1836.554s">So</a>  we appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1837.615s">And</a>  I think that's the, you know, and I appreciate that the general came up and talked about, you know.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1844.329s">And</a>  maybe we should notify the other restaurants that are in that block also about what's happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1850.115s">He's</a>  not the only one there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1851.316s">I</a>  agree. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1851.976s">I</a>  think that we should ask you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1853.658s">There's</a>  two other restaurants there. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1855.32s">Maybe</a>  you should be notified also.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1857.317s">Maybe</a>  community development? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1858.578s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1859.118s">That's</a>  a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1859.819s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1860.259s">To</a>  reach out to Bocelli's and I think Mace Cafe stays open a little later. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1865.463s">So</a>  maybe reaching out to them, form a motion that maybe that the liaison to the businesses can reach out and see what they can do to make sure that they can post some signage or, you know, for their patrons to also respect that neighborhood.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=1880.795s">Do</a>  you want to make that a B paper?</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2244.623s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2245.964s">This</a>  came about when the resident came to us who's been on the list, who lives in a private way who who's lived there for a long time in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2257.032s">she</a>  planted a tree, a rooting tree in front of her establishment, her home, and she sat on the list for three years and was informed by a city engineer, I believe, and I was hoping he was here, but obviously he's not, that the city engineer has now followed through with the hard line, which is a law that the city does not maintain private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2282.519s">I</a>  will tell you I received many phone calls concerning public safety when it comes to these decisions. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2290.082s">We</a>  can understand when it comes to doing these bigger projects and understand our rules and regulations when it comes to private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2297.084s">We</a>  understand that one of the biggest reasons that we don't receive enough funding from the state or the federal government is because Medford has, what people don't realize, an abundance of private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2311.21s">And</a>  it really hurts our bottom line when it comes to road work in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2316.593s">So</a>  if you talk to most people that own homes on private ways, they have a lot of pride and they maintain their homes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2324.658s">And</a>  this one person who has a very dangerous lip now because of a rooting tree and has been on this list, had now been told that this would not work. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2335.404s">And</a>  we need to clarify this because <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2339.087s">The</a>  truth of the matter is, if someone does still trip and fall, the burden falls back on who? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2345.511s">Not</a>  the resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2347.132s">It</a>  comes back to this council and the city and legal action. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2351.735s">So</a>  if you see those suits that we've had in the past, 3,500, 5,500, these all add up to a pretty good number. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2356.018s">But</a>  more importantly, <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2364.757s">I</a>  fear that it's going to be that elderly person that walks down that private way, smashes their head and God forbid passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2373.145s">And</a>  I think this is something that to just be passive about changing this rule as a new new city engineer, and <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2383.191s">And</a>  I wish he was here because I'd like to ask him some questions that the residents that did reach out to him from what I've been told was that it was very arrogant in his presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2394.727s">And</a>  to me as a city employee, municipal employee, that person works for the residents of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2400.885s">And</a>  I think that's the biggest piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2402.686s">I</a>  think that we need to have guidelines set by this administration, really informing the people in the private ways of these rule changes or not to rule changes, but the the the persistence of following those rules now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2418.832s">Now,</a>  I got a phone call from another resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2421.733s">And</a>  he said, Well, George, we live over here near Arthur Winthrop Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2426.342s">My</a>  neighbors and I, three years ago, followed the rule and we brought in a hot top company because the street was deplorable. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2434.764s">And</a>  they talked to these professionals and said, because this isn't a major way, you should use this type of top, this type of patch. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2443.386s">They</a>  repaved the whole street on their dime. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2446.947s">They</a>  did it right. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2448.508s">And</a>  then they're upset now because during the Winthrop Street project, <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2454.925s">The</a>  city diverted all of the traffic where? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2459.788s">Through</a>  this private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2462.009s">Now,</a>  because of the hot top that was laid, because of the trucks that drove down that road consistently, their street is now in disarray. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2473.316s">So</a>  their question that I wanted to ask the city engineer, if this is the case, what fair is fair, is the city now liable for repaving that street? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2485.751s">And</a>  that's a logical point. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2489.773s">But</a>  again, when you're not talking, you're not communicating with your residents, this is a huge concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2496.655s">So</a>  these are the things that are open-ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2498.636s">And</a>  I would make the motion that we ask the city administration to please set up guidelines to re-educate our constituents on the follow through now of our new engineer and the policies that they're now following through or not following through. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2515.852s">and</a>  the fact that what if the city is diverting the public traffic into their private ways and destroying these roadways that have just been paved? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2529.788s">So</a>  I like to get these answered for these constituents because <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2535.224s">The</a>  next step is they said they would come here and the eight people that I did talk to said, you could use my name. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2540.992s">And</a>  I said, you know what, let's see what the answers are in the follow through. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2545.197s">Because</a>  I will tell you, for the residents that are listening, <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2548.773s">This</a>  is very frustrating for us because we ask these questions, not because we want to be rabble rousers because that's because this city administration has come up here and said, well, our, our, our directors, our directors in different departments are actually afraid to come to city council because of backlash or aggressive behavior. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2567.54s">And</a>  this is what we're putting office we're putting office to be their voice. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2573.659s">And</a>  that's not an easy place to stand, but when you were elected or you're hired in a municipal field, that's part of your job. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2581.763s">That's</a>  your, that's part of your job requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2583.544s">Come</a>  here and answer these questions so residents can understand what the process is.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2591.868s">I'm</a>  just, I'm not sure if I heard councilor Scarpelli right. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2594.91s">Is</a>  he saying that the staff of the mayor who came up here and said that she's holding people accountable? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2601.915s">is</a>  scared to come before this council and be held accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2605.218s">That's</a>  what it sounds like to me Council Scarpelli is that they're scared to come before the city council and be held accountable, but the mayor comes up here and beats her chest, saying how she's holding people accountable when she's getting dragged out of here and handcuffs and making them undergo psychological evaluations. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2618.248s">So</a>  I'm a little concerned about that and I thank the council for bringing that up and that's a very good point, but I know, and I'll end with this.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2626.614s">I</a>  think we need more communication through the administration to really let our constituents know of these processes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2636.854s">When</a>  no one comes up to answer these questions, everything's left open-ended. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2640.277s">And</a>  the frustration gets to a boiling point where we're seeing good people in this community putting for sale signs and moving out. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2647.922s">And</a>  that I hate to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2650.244s">And</a>  all it is sometimes is just simple conversation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2653.347s">You</a>  saw what we did tonight with a very, very, very <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2658.15s">productive</a>  business in our city and neighbors that had an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2661.533s">They</a>  got to sit down together because we opened the line of communication for them and they found the best avenue for both parties. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2668.897s">So</a>  these are the things we need in our community and I think the city administration is really failing us. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2674.001s">So</a>  thank you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2682.045s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell and I think the two specific questions that Councilors are probably raised at the end are important ones to resurface for constituents I think if he's making a motion to have a committee of the whole on those two I think, I think that these are topics that we've talked about a lot this term already and I think that our city engineer and others in the engineering department have offered really helpful insight I mean just for me as an individual Councilor and resident. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2708.021s">The</a>  issue of how private ways interact with the rest of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2712.165s">Obviously,</a>  it's it's genuinely confusing and they've given us good counsel before and I think that sort of that causal chain like if this then what if you live on a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2721.393s">Clearly</a>  there's still more residents that we have to reach with that information I agree that we need a better communication strategy for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2728.339s">I</a>  just wanted to raise you know I, I, I think that, um, <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2733.655s">Yeah,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2734.657s">This</a>  is clearly an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2736.64s">One,</a>  because it's come up again, because it's come up so many times before this term, whether we've been talking about in the chambers, and I know that I've had one-on-one conversations with residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2745.463s">many</a>  times in my pretty short term so far. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2748.426s">I've</a>  had to go to the engineer and ask him for insight that I then relay back to the residents just about the various issues involved in living on private ways. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2755.873s">And</a>  the other thing that I think is important to note in this conversation in terms of, you know, what are the reasons that we're not serving our constituents and our constituents on private ways, you know, to the best of our ability is everybody is trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2769.046s">make</a>  do with pretty scarce resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2771.43s">I</a>  remember one of the things that I've heard from members of our DPW staff and our engineer in the past is, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2778.896s">matters</a>  of public safety are always prioritized when possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2782.899s">But</a>  our ceiling for what's possible is really low, and budgets are extremely tight when everybody's operating on skeleton resources. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2790.564s">And</a>  I don't think that that is always the decision of individual staff people, but just operating in a very austere environment. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2798.249s">So</a>  I think that's important to bring into conversation, because when we're talking about safety of our residents and safety of our residents in our private ways, <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2808.619s">The</a>  decisions that we make and the decisions that the administration makes about the resources that we have to deploy around our community in the interest of aesthetics and public safety, that trickles down to individual cases like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2823.18s">And</a>  so I think it's fair to say we need insight from this position specifically and that role specifically, but also to say, if we don't have resources to go around where most of the people who come to us with an issue on a private way leave that conversation disappointed, we need to take a hard look at our books and see what would it take to be able to better serve those residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2841.094s">Because</a>  as I know, we've talked as a council about how expensive it is to bring a private way back into the public fold. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2848.866s">Um,</a>  you know, those are residents that were that we are sort of agreeing to leave in that situation when we don't build towards a plan where we can bring those back under public jurisdiction. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2859.511s">So</a>  I just wanted to raise the point that I think that this is this is part of the long term strategy to that we've been talking about all year is, you know, sort of lacking comprehensiveness. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2868.714s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2869.955s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2871.296s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2871.996s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2872.656s">No,</a>  this is something. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2875.375s">that</a>  we get questions on all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2877.336s">But</a>  it seems like over the last year and a half is when these issues seem to come to a head. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2887.778s">The</a>  TPW in the past has always maintained these roads for the people and the best they could. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2893.8s">They</a>  trimmed trees and they did whatever they could. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2898.001s">Now</a>  we're at the point, since this new engineer is taking over and under the administration, <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2903.853s">We</a>  expect the people to pay for their own tree trimming, pay for their own street, pay for everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2912.11s">and</a>  I don't see them getting a reduction in their tax rate. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2915.832s">They</a>  pay the same amount of taxes that everybody else in this room pays, and they're entitled to the same amount of services. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2921.334s">Not</a>  what our engineer decides is his idea of services, because this has just started under this new watch in the last year and a half. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2930.537s">So</a>  I thank Councilor Scott Pate for bringing this up, but this is, I say, this DPW has always taken care of these issues, and now they don't.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2941.141s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2943.102s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2944.143s">I</a>  don't think that the engineer is the bad guy in this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2946.845s">I</a>  think that the engineer is the fall guy, which is a difference because we've had previous administrations in this community that have allowed private ways to be provided with maintenance and services, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2957.152s">And</a>  the only thing that's different is the administration, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2960.394s">So</a>  this is definitely an administrative prerogative. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2962.936s">It's</a>  something that we're seeing come down from the top. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2965.437s">It's</a>  not coming from the engineer across the city, it's coming from the boss, the mayor, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2970.037s">So</a>  when we talk about this resolution and we talk about the issues that Councilor Scarpelli brings up, he says that the city is not maintaining private waste, which would infer that we're maintaining public waste, and we're not doing that either. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=2984.124s">But</a>  when we talk about the services that you're entitled to and receive access to as a resident on a private way, we talk about access to the public schools, access to public safety and first response, snow removal and trash removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3001.773s">We</a>  don't get trees trimmed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3002.895s">We</a>  don't get sidewalks fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3004.097s">We</a>  don't get streets paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3005.659s">What</a>  about the underground infrastructure? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3007.843s">Is</a>  that the responsibility of the taxpayer? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3009.546s">Is</a>  that the responsibility of the city? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3013.092s">Okay,</a>  so where does it stop and where does it start is a big question. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3017.135s">Now,</a>  I don't think people who live on private ways have a problem living on a private way, quite frankly, I don't think people that live on a private way would have a problem paying for some of these services that they want themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3028.282s">I</a>  think part of the problem is that they can't get anybody to provide them with help when they want to initiate their rights at City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3034.707s">So</a>  if I lived on a private way and I said look at I want to put up a crash bar and I want to say resident access only. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3040.612s">Say</a>  Wildwood Road, for example, right across the street from Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3043.855s">It's</a>  a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3045.256s">Why</a>  can't they put up, just like they have on Rosina Drive in the Heights, on Murray Hill Road in the Heights, a crash bar where cars can't drive down that street because it's a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3055.944s">And</a>  they can tell you when and when you can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3057.845s">The</a>  fire department can still provide emergency access. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3060.487s">The</a>  police department can still have emergency access. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3062.228s">The</a>  MS can still have emergency access. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3066.322s">and</a>  these residents that live on the streets that are abutting the Mystic Lakes complain year in and year out about the fact that neighborhoods being overrun and inundated by people that are parking on their private ways in front of their houses and their driveways and the like to access the Mystic Lakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3082.313s">But</a>  the city doesn't provide them with the information or the tools necessary to protect themselves on their private way, but won't provide them the services either. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3089.038s">It</a>  becomes very frustrating. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3090.919s">And</a>  inaction is not an answer or a response. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3094.76s">to</a>  a circumstance in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3097.362s">So</a>  meetings are great, but ultimately we've had a number of meetings on this back in September and even previously, and we're still talking about it because there's been inaction. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3107.69s">And</a>  that's the difference between what makes a thriving community and what makes a failing community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3112.934s">So</a>  when we talk about the one thing that people want when they move into a city is they wanna make sure that their tax dollars stretch a long way, they get banked for their buck and they're provided with city services. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3123.391s">We</a>  have over 30% of the streets in this community that are private ways and we're not providing those people with services. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3128.416s">Thus</a>  far, I feel as though we're failing them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3130.818s">We're</a>  failing them because we're not providing them with any recourse information or ability to enact or enact their rights or enable themselves to protect their, their investment in their future destiny in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3142.428s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3143.089s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3144.49s">President</a>  Bears.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3145.631s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President, I just wanted to note that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3148.215s">We</a>  did hold a meeting on private ways with the DPW commissioner on October 25th, 2022, and that recording is available through Medford Community Media. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3158.843s">And</a>  there's also more information about the city's policies on private ways around enforcement on the city website and the police department website.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3168.01s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3169.222s">And</a>  just go probably apologize was your motion to have a committee of the whole on this topic and invite the city engineer, or.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3174.747s">Madam</a>  President, I think that the goal for this is really to educate the constituents, and <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3184.842s">And</a>  so I would like to see a community hall with those residents of private ways, get the word out. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3190.205s">And</a>  I appreciate Councilor Knight and Councilor Bears sending that information, but when you are living to a certain standard here, and you've grown up in a private way or lived in a private way, and all of a sudden snap a finger, the way that you've lived your life, things have changed now, whether it's right, wrong or indifferent. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3216.375s">The</a>  residents that live in those private ways have to be reeducated and really have to acknowledge what needs to be expected as they move on. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3231.849s">If</a>  this is the way it goes, like Councilor Knight said, <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3235.478s">the</a>  I don't blame the city engineer in any way. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3238.921s">I</a>  question his his behavior or his tone with what residents have told me. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3244.926s">And</a>  you know, I'd like I said, if he was here, I'd love to ask him but but that's the what I question with our our city engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3252.192s">Again,</a>  my question is really <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3254.962s">you're</a>  making changes, sweeping changes that are really affecting our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3259.624s">And</a>  especially when it comes to public safety, when people are expecting their sidewalks to get done. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3266.566s">Because</a>  imagine if, like Councilor Knight said, you have a sidewalk that's panels lifted, you have an elderly parent that lives in your home with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3276.069s">You're</a>  expecting the city to make these changes because they've been on this list, so they wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3282.377s">Now</a>  all of a sudden they're told that after three years you're top of that list. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3285.545s">They</a>  know we're not fixing it because you're a private way. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3288.713s">We're</a>  changing our policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3290.854s">So</a>  that's the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3292.775s">I</a>  think we need to meet with all of these departments and really set the tone with how to reeducate our private way residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3301.02s">And</a>  then maybe they have to answer some questions about legitimate questions that were brought about on detours and sending heavy trucking that ruined a street that has just been paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3313.848s">So</a>  these are legitimate issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3316.169s">So</a>  thank you, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3317.814s">Thank</a>  you guys.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3318.394s">President</a>  Bears Thank you Madam President, and I just want to reiterate I don't disagree with that at all I think this actually really speaks to why it's so important that the mayor approves these charter ballot questions that we just move forward, and we implement the better budget plan because we need to have an honest conversation what is it going to cost to bring everything up to a state of good repair, what is it going to cost to bring all these private ways in the public domain. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3339.74s">and</a>  we need a plan for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3340.98s">And</a>  right now we don't even have the process to have the conversations to come up with a plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3344.921s">So</a>  we're stuck with scheduling this meeting and that meeting and the police have a meeting and we had a subcommittee meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3349.883s">Now</a>  we have a committee, the whole meeting, but we need a budget plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3353.143s">And</a>  so that's why I'm so glad that the council moved forward on these amendments. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3357.365s">And</a>  I really hope that the mayor moves forward on them as well so that the voters can have a choice.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3363.366s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3364.306s">So</a>  we have a motion from <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3368.419s">We</a>  have a motion from apologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3370.98s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3371.32s">We</a>  have a motion from Councilor Scarpelli for a committee of the whole to invite the city engineer as well as all residents.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3457.27s">Madam</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3458.811s">These</a>  are some items that have been popular fodder for discussion in our community over recent months. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3466.896s">Recently,</a>  the school department has met and they've discussed their budget priorities. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3471.259s">Looks</a>  like they're about eight or $900,000 short from where they'd like to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3476.712s">I've</a>  always had an issue with the school committee and their ability to manage within their budget sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3485.316s">I</a>  feel like sometimes you've got to make hard decisions, and that's what elected officials are putting these positions for. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3490.878s">And</a>  when it comes time to tightening the belt and spending within your means, sometimes our school committee does not do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3497.481s">And</a>  as a result, we see some wasteful spending. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3501.022s">It's</a>  been brought to my attention that some of these cost items that are <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3505.224s">included</a>  in this list, Madam President, are reaching astronomical figures. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3509.247s">For</a>  example, it's my understanding that the cost for teachers covering hallway security duties is somewhere around $25,000 to $35,000 a week of ARPA money being spent for teachers to monitor the hallways up in Method High. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3524.076s">So</a>  when we're talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3526.999s">a</a>  school committee's professed shortfall of about $800,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3529.984s">Let's</a>  take a look at some of the spending that we're doing when we talk about the investigation into the NHL softball team. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3536.015s">I</a>  know we have attorney Howard Greenspan <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3538.653s">as</a>  the school department's attorney who's on retainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3541.274s">Did</a>  KP Law conduct the investigation? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3543.314s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3544.074s">Why</a>  did KP Law conduct the investigation? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3545.815s">Was</a>  that a special contract? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3547.075s">Was</a>  that something that fell outside the scope of our contract with KP Law? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3550.576s">Is</a>  that something we're going to be assessed for? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3552.116s">How</a>  much did it cost? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3552.976s">What</a>  were the findings of the investigation? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3554.917s">Was</a>  it a worthy expenditure? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3556.457s">Should</a>  we have used internal counsel that we have on retainer or should we have gone outside? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3560.513s">Is</a>  this wasteful spending? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3562.034s">So</a>  Madam President, these are some things that I want to take a look at when we talk about the position of data manager and the position of data director. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3569.516s">From</a>  what I understand, they have the exact same duties, responsibilities and functions. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3573.477s">The</a>  only difference is the salary. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3576.018s">the</a>  incumbent that's in the position is a female who's going to make $10,000 to $15,000 less than the new appointee who's a male. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3582.822s">But</a>  their responsibilities and duties really aren't that different. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3585.303s">So</a>  I want to know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3586.523s">Why</a>  is there such a disparity in the wages between these two positions? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3590.506s">And</a>  why is there a need for two positions with duplicate duties? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3595.028s">Also,</a>  you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3597.753s">Medford</a>  High has been on the news a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3599.054s">It's</a>  not for winning state championships, all right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3601.876s">It's</a>  because of violence in our school department. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3604.718s">So</a>  the school department went and they hired a consultant. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3607.08s">They</a>  spent a lot of money on a consultant to file a report, and this report makes suggestions. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3611.483s">I</a>  want to know what these suggestions are, what the cost of the report was, and whether or not these suggestions are even being implemented, or whether it was just a, let's get us out of the news, hire a consultant to come in here and do a report, and then we can wave the report in the air and say, no, we did something, but not implement any of the changes that they've asked for. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3627.737s">So</a>  when we talk about previous administration of the school department, and we talk about a gentleman like Mr. Belson, who'd come before us, and who would talk about school violence, well, Roy was one of the founders of the STARS program, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3641.402s">The</a>  School Threat Assessment and Response System that's been implemented statewide, okay? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3649.165s">That</a>  was in response to an issue back in the early 90s. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3656.495s">What</a>  steps has this administration taken to put in something like a STARS program that would assess violence on our school systems and establish reasonable response? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3669.224s">So</a>  these are some of the things that I have great concern about. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3671.446s">We</a>  all talk about you can't put a price tag on public safety, but apparently you can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3676.13s">I</a>  mean, if this is any truth to this expenditure at $33,000 a week in APA funds being assigned for teachers to monitor the halls, <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3684.287s">I</a>  think that's gross negligence in terms of spending, and it's a gross negligence of the fiduciary responsibility of the stewards of our taxes. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3692.21s">So</a>  it's pretty self-explanatory. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3693.87s">When</a>  we get the answers to the questions, we'll be in a better position to figure out exactly what's going on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3699.892s">This</a>  council's been asking now for financial data for three years, and we haven't been receiving it forthwith. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3705.294s">So</a>  my hope was to put this on the agenda to give everybody ample notice and time to prepare it, to give it to us before our budget discussions finalize at the end of the month, Madam President.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3713.999s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3715.54s">Any</a>  further discussion from the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3719.744s">Seeing</a>  none, on the motion of Councilor Knight, seconded by Councilor Caraviello, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=3736.497s">Temporarily</a>  absent.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4231.955s">Saturdays</a>  when there are federal and state elections because it's a local election. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4236.115s">We're</a>  trying to keep it during the week when we have staff in hand and keep the overtime hours down. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4245.08s">But</a>  we are not required. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4246.401s">It's</a>  a courtesy to voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4248.562s">The</a>  reason why this information is presented to you tonight is because it's an opt-in situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4254.085s">So</a>  we're requesting that you accept our presentation on early voting hours, early voting person hours.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4266.862s">The</a>  paper before us has no language on it, legal or otherwise, saying it doesn't mean the City Council opt in to support early voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4273.083s">It</a>  doesn't tell us when the dates are going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4276.824s">So</a>  from a legal standpoint, I mean, usually if there's an opt-in, there's some certain language that you need to adopt or support in order for an opt-in to happen.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4284.725s">Are</a>  you able to offer clarity on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4286.466s">Is</a>  this something that the Council needs to know?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4288.206s">That's</a>  not the paper that's before us this evening.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4292.807s">Sure,</a>  I can offer clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4295.588s">What</a>  we're doing is the Election Commission has approved within their meetings the dates of early voting, and as a courtesy to the board at the City Council, we're offering them the opportunity just to agree and accept that these are the dates that we're going to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4311.695s">And</a>  if there were any questions, we would answer any questions about that at that time.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4317.517s">So</a>  we don't have to take any action. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4321.32s">There's</a>  a courtesy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4324.042s">It's</a>  not a necessary mechanism of government for us to take a vote for this to happen, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4328.246s">It's</a>  going to happen no matter what.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4330.989s">It's</a>  important, informative, and we also just appreciate you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4335.487s">accepting</a>  what we've presented to you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4337.188s">We</a>  don't have to write the board just an autonomous board that's made its determination and they're presenting us their findings. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4343.19s">I'm</a>  fine with that.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4345.731s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4347.272s">Thank</a>  you, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4348.172s">I</a>  for one, I'm not comfortable with not having Saturdays. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4351.113s">I</a>  think Saturdays are really important for early voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4353.054s">I</a>  think we know municipal elections are the least <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4358.802s">I</a>  think we should give them the most opportunity to get people to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4363.206s">This</a>  is why I was so concerned with the budget presented to us for the election office because it sounds like we're trying not to spend more money this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4369.651s">So</a>  we're not going to do early voting on Saturdays for municipal election when we're electing the mayor and the city council, the school committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4376.716s">the</a>  three offices probably that actually impact residents' lives the most of any government office versus I'm pretty sure I know how Medford's gonna vote in November 2024 and 2026 and 2028. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4386.024s">Hope,</a>  maybe I'm wrong, I don't know. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4392.83s">So</a>  I just feel really uncomfortable not having the Saturdays and <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4402.817s">I</a>  think we've done more, correct me if I'm wrong, I believe we've done more early voting for municipal elections in previous years than this amount that's being offered.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4411.384s">So</a>  for state, I can't speak to early voting for municipal elections prior to this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4418.909s">I</a>  know that early voting with the state, they do give us requirements as to what we have to offer when it's a state and federal election required to do Saturdays and Sundays based on the population of the city of Metzger. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4432.239s">What</a>  I will offer to you is I understand that Saturdays are important. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4436.22s">However,</a>  when we've done elections on Saturdays, they are lower turnouts. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4442.642s">And</a>  so the idea is that if we keep the election availability during the week, as well as doing early voting via ballots, early mail to ballots, we actually may get the same amount of people as opposed to offering Saturday time.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4458.004s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4458.404s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4458.705s">I</a>  mean, we definitely last general election offered five days early voting, including a Saturday as well as vote by mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4465.973s">And</a>  I think we should at least continue with what we've done in the past.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4469.536s">Is</a>  that for a municipal election?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4471.118s">That</a>  was municipal election, November 2nd, 2021. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4472.88s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4473.14s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Justin Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4478.718s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4478.998s">I</a>  just wanted to add my voice to the choir supporting Saturday early voting dates. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4484.905s">I</a>  mean, respectfully, I think it's really important for accessibility, and even if Saturday sees lower turnout, per se, a lot of those voters might only be able to vote on Saturday, or that might be the most <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4498.8s">by</a>  far the most convenient option for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4500.922s">And</a>  I wouldn't want to take that piece of our democracy away. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4506.826s">And</a>  so anything we can do to sustain that, to keep that as an option, I think is really important.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4514.871s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4519.014s">Councilor</a>  Collins.</p>

    <p>[Kit Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4521.336s">Thank</a>  you, President Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4522.957s">I</a>  agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4523.698s">I</a>  think that having a weekend opportunity is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4527.961s">You</a>  know, people have different schedules, different work schedules. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4530.362s">I</a>  also want to note to Election Manager Ripley, I apologize. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4534.105s">I</a>  think I misunderstood the previous motion we took. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4536.066s">I</a>  certainly didn't want to preempt your office's opportunity to speak on the presentation that you've created, especially since this is an opportunity to get the word out to residents and voters about what to expect for our <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4549.221s">elections</a>  in September and November, so I know there's a lot of, you know, great kind of FAQ information submitted onto our agenda. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4558.189s">Certainly,</a>  if there's anything more that you wanted to share or were planning to share relating to the Miss Paul elections, the sort of know before you go section, I'd certainly be eager to hear that from your office. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4570.059s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4572.021s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4572.381s">Councilor</a>  Caraviellol.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4573.397s">President,</a>  I'd make a motion that these papers be sent back to the commission for re-examination and reconsideration for Saturday voting.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4585.095s">The</a>  paper requires an election from the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4587.517s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4587.918s">So</a>  my worst fear is Oh, well, I didn't get a chance to vote because early voting wasn't open on Wednesday, the 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4592.661s">Well,</a>  the city council approved the schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4594.383s">City</a>  Council has no authority on this whatsoever. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4596.885s">So</a>  we can recommend that they open on Saturday. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4599.247s">I</a>  don't have a problem with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4600.408s">But</a>  in terms of supporting the plan and not supporting the plan, we don't have to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4603.951s">I</a>  don't think we should.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4606.213s">We</a>  do have a motion on the floor before yours from Council night to receive a place on file. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4610.648s">Before</a>  we get to that, I just also want to add my voice to the chorus of just concerns about not having a Saturday voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4616.832s">I</a>  think Councilor Tseng made a really good point. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4618.773s">I</a>  understand that it may be lower turnout numbers, but that may be the only date those people can vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4623.897s">We</a>  don't know that, but I think it's really important to have. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4627.039s">So</a>  it's something we have had in the past that people, you know, they may have voted that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4631.122s">They</a>  may have voted on Saturday two years ago, and they're counting on voting on Saturday this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4635.364s">And</a>  to find out they can't, they may have missed their window. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4637.566s">So</a>  I just want to add to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4639.593s">So</a>  a motion from Councilor Knight to receive and place a file seconded by Vice President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4644.696s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4697.95s">just</a>  wanted to add a couple questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4699.652s">This</a>  is separate from the call to election, which you're gonna put before us at a later date to put this on the ballot. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4706.378s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4708.399s">And</a>  sorry, I didn't ask it when you were talking about vote by mail, just a little bit ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4714.185s">We've</a>  had a relationship with the post office in Medford around vote by mail, the last few elections, given the just sheer volume. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4723.593s">in</a>  2020, 2021, and 2022. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4726.455s">What's</a>  the status of that relationship? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4729.937s">Is</a>  everything going to be in place for September and November? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4733.779s">And</a>  also, how has that been going with the census? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4737.321s">We</a>  touched on it last time we talked, but I just wanted to check on those two things really quick.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4743.285s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4743.525s">So</a>  we have met with both the supervisor and the manager at the post office. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4750.009s">I</a>  met with them two weeks ago just to discuss what our needs were. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4753.59s">The</a>  election calendar went out to them today just so that they're aware of when we're going to be sending things out and when we want to accept things in. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4764.337s">The</a>  gentleman's name is Brian. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4765.698s">Brian</a>  will be working closely with us. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4767.759s">We</a>  will have ID badges so that when we go over to the post office, the only people that can pick up elections materials will be someone in our office that has an ID badge and they're aware of those requirements. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4780.867s">When</a>  it comes to sending mail out, <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4783.161s">We</a>  do now have these green tags that designate the envelopes as ballots. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4788.785s">Those</a>  are used across the state to ensure that the ballots are processed faster than other mail. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4794.369s">So</a>  that is something that was not in place and is now in place. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4797.451s">So</a>  what happens is, when we send ballots out, we wrap these green tags around the ballots, bring them to the post office, and they get processed more quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4807.397s">Henry?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4808.641s">and</a>  the other commissioners will be assisting us when it comes to going to the post office if we need that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4814.404s">The</a>  idea is that we should be able to do that ourselves within the office, within the, you know, just making sure we have coverage in the office and getting the balance. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4822.868s">Does</a>  that answer?</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4823.708s">Yeah,</a>  and just that arrangement's in place for the city census as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4827.23s">It</a>  is, correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4827.89s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4828.17s">Yep,</a>  it is all in place, and what we're doing is we're also prepping for the March election so the post office is aware of what our needs are for March as well.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4836.954s">Okay,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4838.671s">Can</a>  I bring up two things? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4840.592s">I</a>  don't know if it's appropriate or not, but I just want to make a reminder that the 13th, along with what we're talking about, the positions, the 13th is the day that nomination papers will be available in our office. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4852.699s">It's</a>  room 102, so please pass the word if people are going to be running for office to stop in. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4858.603s">The</a>  other thing is... I'm sorry? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4862.165s">They</a>  close on the 28th of July. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4867.249s">And</a>  that's the last date to pull papers? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4870.571s">That's</a>  the last day to submit papers to our office. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4872.993s">The</a>  papers will be certified by August 8th.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4917.584s">on</a>  the <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4938.812s">Now</a>  historically, up until Sandy Gale became the elections manager, we never had this issue with the census and with people getting pulled from the list and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4947.039s">It's</a>  been a nightmare ever since. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4948.26s">It's</a>  created a ton of problems in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4950.521s">We've</a>  had people coming up here saying the elections have been raked. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4952.923s">I</a>  remember Richard Brady Daugherty up here screaming and yelling saying that the elections raked and Zach Baer's fault because he talked to Sandy and they were colluding to remove people from the rolls and everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4964.172s">It's</a>  a bad practice, you know, it didn't have that didn't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4966.973s">But</a>  that was the that was the general consensus throughout the community was that, you know, Zach was running around trying to control the voting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4975.795s">But</a>  anyway, what I'm saying is, why don't we cool it on that a little bit, relax a little bit, because it does create a situation where a lot of people get frustrated and it creates voter apathy, where they don't want to come out and vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4986.698s">and</a>  they don't want to go and waste their time going through this ordeal of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4990.699s">I</a>  know the elections are great, but they're overwhelmed when they get in there and they got one person that says, what do you mean I can't vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4996.301s">Well,</a>  listen, I just talked to 4,000 people that can and you can't. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=4998.902s">Like,</a>  sorry, what do you want me to tell you guys? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5000.082s">Today's</a>  the biggest day of the year for me, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5002.943s">And</a>  they don't get the attention that they deserve. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5004.383s">And</a>  then they have to come down to city hall and go back and go back to the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5007.264s">They're</a>  not going to vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5007.984s">They're</a>  just not going to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5009.665s">So</a>  I'll reiterate the fact, I don't think it's the best practice. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5013.646s">I</a>  mean, it might be what you're required to do, what you can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5015.907s">I</a>  think it's what you can do, not necessarily what you're required to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5018.908s">But</a>  I don't think that it's working in favor of promoting full involvement in elections.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5030.612s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5030.712s">I</a>  want to make sure that people are active voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5034.781s">If</a>  you don't mind, I would love to explain to you the process. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5038.823s">We</a>  are required by law to send the census out. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5042.986s">By</a>  June 15th, we are required to inactivate voters who have not returned their census. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5049.009s">We've</a>  moved our timeframe up so that we have plenty of time to let people know through the postcards that they needed to let us know that they're still living in Medford.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5059.446s">example,</a>  like I have to fill out a census, I'm on the ballot, and I gotta fill out a census every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5063.971s">And</a>  I can't vote for myself if I don't. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5066.074s">This</a>  is crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5066.575s">I</a>  can't sign my own nomination papers if I don't fill out the census, but I'm an elected official in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5070.66s">To</a>  be an elected official, I believe I have to be a registered voter. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5073.543s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5073.824s">So</a>  I'm not a registered voter right now because I didn't fill out the census.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5076.607s">No,</a>  there's a difference.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5077.947s">I</a>  apologize.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5079.508s">So</a>  an active voter simply means you haven't returned your census. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5082.569s">And</a>  we do everything in our power to make sure that any inactive voters are notified that they're inactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5089.511s">And</a>  that when they go to the polls, we may try and make it as easy as possible for them to be able to just show their ID and vote.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5095.674s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5096.394s">And</a>  what I'm saying is that the past practice was never like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5099.375s">And</a>  it was always very, it was always a lot easier than what's going on now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5104.1s">Now,</a>  if this is the way it's going to be, this is the way it's going to be, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5107.283s">I'm</a>  just saying that I don't think it's necessarily conducive to promoting full involvement in elections.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5114.189s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5116.551s">Vice</a>  President Paris.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5118.693s">I'm</a>  a little concerned because what I'm hearing is if people didn't fill out their census and they sign a nomination form, then those signatures will not be valid for the purposes of nomination.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5131.283s">That</a>  is my understanding correct.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5133.623s">Sorry,</a>  go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5135.944s">You</a>  can ask your question.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5137.784s">How</a>  many census forms went out and how many have been returned?</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5141.345s">23,000</a>  census forms were sent out to the households in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5145.025s">We</a>  have received back about 17,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5150.006s">Yes,</a>  we sent another 15,000 cards out to registered voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5155.087s">Some</a>  of those cards come back as PO returns because the people have moved and they haven't notified us. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5160.966s">We</a>  are following up as quickly as we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5164.528s">We've</a>  received about 4,000 returns on the postcards to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5168.751s">So,</a>  and we're still having them come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5170.672s">And</a>  people can, the cards can come in any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5173.774s">I</a>  mean, there's no drop dead date for the cards. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5176.676s">We</a>  just would like to have the cards sent in before the September election.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5181.553s">Got</a>  it, so you're expecting most people who are active voters now will be active voters on June 16th?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5186.238s">Absolutely.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5187.058s">Okay,</a>  could you just communicate that number to us to let us know how many people were inactivated once that's completed?</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5196.928s">So</a>  people have already been inactivated. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5199.17s">So</a>  if they didn't send their census in by April 25th, we then sent out postcards to 15,000 people. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5206.671s">And</a>  we've gotten back about 4,000 postcards. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5209.593s">So</a>  we're still working on getting them in. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5213.236s">We</a>  process them every day. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5214.937s">We</a>  did go to the post office to check and make sure that the post office was sending them to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5219.321s">We</a>  made sure that we had all our business reply mail money in place so that the postcards aren't delayed at all.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5225.026s">If</a>  you could just at whatever point you feel, either if it's June 16th or before then, communicate to the council through the clerk and the president. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5235.351s">how</a>  many, what percentage of registered voters in the city are active versus inactive and how many were made inactive this year? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5240.833s">The</a>  percentage, it could be the actual number, it could be both, but you know.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5246.474s">So</a>  about 15,000 voters were made inactive.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5249.015s">And</a>  how many voters are there?</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5250.095s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5252.356s">How</a>  many voters are there?</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5253.096s">There</a>  are, so there are.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5257.857s">Including</a>  the 15,000 hit the road.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5261.024s">I</a>  don't have the number in front of me. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5262.504s">I</a>  don't want to quote a number that I would give you incorrectly.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5265.265s">It's</a>  like a third that you threw out, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5267.906s">Mm-hmm.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5268.306s">So</a>  like 33% of the registered voters are no longer, are inactive now. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5271.367s">They're</a>  inactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5271.707s">Because</a>  they didn't send back a census.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5272.927s">But</a>  there's 4,000 that have sent it in. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5274.928s">So</a>  we've reduced that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5276.068s">Yeah,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5276.468s">But</a>  I mean, ultimately, you took a third of the population from inactive. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5282.35s">Correct,</a>  as required. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5285.031s">A</a>  third of the voting population, 33%.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5286.451s">As</a>  required by a law, yes.</p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5288.892s">That's</a>  crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5292.218s">So</a>  there were 15,000 who hadn't returned, who were registered. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5295.6s">Now</a>  they returned their postcards, so it's down to 11,000?</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5298.102s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Zac Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5298.802s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5299.362s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5300.863s">And</a>  just to give you a perspective, Somerville, when we inactivated our folks, they had a 30% return rate on their census. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5310.689s">So</a>  our census was higher than that.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5312.75s">My</a>  experience with Somerville have always been they make things very difficult for anybody to do anything over there.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5318.654s">Fair</a>  enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5321.403s">And</a>  does SARA follow a similar policy as far as how quickly they inactivate people?</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5326.925s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5327.485s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5327.785s">Everybody</a>  has to be inactivated by early June. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5331.146s">And</a>  what I did- What happens if they're not?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5333.587s">Do</a>  they turn into a pumpkin?</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5335.407s">If</a>  they're not inactivated, we're not in compliance.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5338.228s">And</a>  then what happens?</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5341.349s">I</a>  don't know what the state does if we're not in compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5343.41s">I</a>  just would prefer to be in compliance because I think it's important that we follow the rules that are given to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5350.812s">to</a>  uphold the integrity of the election.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5353.053s">I</a>  understand your frustration with the- I mean, you can't just throw a third of the people in the community off the voter rolls. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5359.635s">You</a>  want to say that they can still vote? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5360.835s">Listen,</a>  you made them inactive voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5362.195s">They're</a>  going to show up at the polls and they're going to say, no, you can't vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5364.636s">Go</a>  stand in the corner and fill it out in the bad boy booth. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5367.177s">Right?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5367.497s">I</a>  mean, that's what happens, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5368.677s">So</a>  it's hard enough to get people to want to participate. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5371.178s">And</a>  I just think that this is a failed policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5372.598s">It's</a>  not your policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5374.159s">It's</a>  just a failed policy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5375.199s">You're</a>  saying it's to comply with the state law. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5376.999s">I</a>  think that doesn't make any sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5378.22s">It's</a>  crazy. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5379.34s">It's</a>  crazy if you fall off the, if you don't fill out your census form, but they not send you an excise tax bill, pretty sure they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5384.102s">You</a>  know what I mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5385.663s">Pretty</a>  sure they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5386.303s">So</a>  they're going to take away your right to have a voice, but they're still going to tax you.</p>

    <p>[Elections Manager]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5390.005s">One</a>  thing that we've, one thing that we have implemented in order to make the affirmations for inactive voters easier is we just have a roster. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5398.789s">So</a>  people are just, you know, there's four boxes, sign your name, what's your address and write your hand, write your name so that we know who you are. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5407.668s">It</a>  makes it much faster than having people fill out two or three forms, which is why there has been past practice.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5415.031s">So</a>  we'll continue to- That was the past practice beginning within the last 36 months.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5420.693s">Well,</a>  we'll continue to approve that process. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5423.174s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5423.534s">So</a>  we have a motion from Councilor Knight to receive and place on file, seconded by- Second. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5430.837s">Vice</a>  Mayor Bears, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5439.046s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5439.366s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5439.847s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5440.047s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5440.167s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5440.307s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5440.567s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5476.876s">I</a>  received a correspondence today from the firefighters union. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5480.319s">And</a>  at our last meeting, I believe that I do have the right to initiate a point of personal privilege. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5486.944s">The</a>  mayor told me that I was being distruthful at the meeting the other night. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5490.787s">And</a>  this was the same meeting that the mayor said that she was very close to settling all the union contracts and that they were doing a great job and they were this close to settling all the contracts, including the fire contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5503.017s">And</a>  this evening, Madam President, in our mailboxes before the meeting, we received a correspondence from the fire union. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5510.485s">And</a>  what it says is this administration has been in office for three years and five months. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5515.731s">Local</a>  1033, I'm sorry, local 1032, which is the Metro Firefighters Union, has been without a contract for 706 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5524.993s">The</a>  mayor spoke last week about how well negotiations were going with the fire department and that we were close to settling a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5534.999s">I</a>  just want to repeat that. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5536.96s">The</a>  mayor spoke last week about how well negotiations were going with the fire department and that we were close to settling a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5544.944s">That</a>  was clear, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5546.485s">That's</a>  what the mayor said? <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5547.486s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5548.126s">Well,</a>  this is what the union says. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5549.247s">This</a>  could not be any further from the truth. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5554.241s">the</a>  city is proposing in their budget double digit percentage raises to their non-union employees while unions in the city go years without a contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5565.789s">We</a>  have new hires to this day who still do not have health insurance through the city of Medford because of administrative errors. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5574.514s">The</a>  mayor's office represented that everybody was covered and that this problem was resolved. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5585.437s">There's</a>  another thing in this letter that I'd like to point out, Madam President, and that's that in this budget that the mayor has proposed, they're cutting two more firefighter positions. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5597.106s">At</a>  the same time, the mayor is putting out press releases boasting how the city of Medford is one of the fastest growing communities in the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5605.313s">So</a>  we have a communication here from employees of this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5610.337s">I'd</a>  ask that they be included in the record, Madam President. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5612.879s">It</a>  was addressed to this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5615.25s">It's</a>  highlighting issues and concerns that were brought up at last week's meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5619.053s">And</a>  it addresses certain things that were said, and I think that it should be included as part of the record and ask my council colleagues to support me and having this letter included as part of the record.</p>

    <p>[Nicole Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5627.32s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5629.562s">All</a>  right, we have a motion from Councilor Knight to include this letter in the record seconded by Vice President Beyers. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5639.07s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, please call the roll.</p>

    <p>[Milva McDonald]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5676.785s">Hi,</a>  Milva McDonald, 61 Monument Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5679.748s">Thank</a>  you for allowing me to speak tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5683.091s">I'm</a>  the chair of the Medford Charter Study Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5685.834s">As</a>  you know, charter review has been discussed in Medford for many years, and we are at an exciting moment right now with volunteer residents undertaking the task. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5696.705s">As</a>  we work <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5697.826s">with</a>  the Collins Center for Public Management, a nonprofit entity out of UMass Boston that has guided many communities through the process of charter review. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5707.278s">We</a>  are examining the charter as a whole and learning, among other things, about how pieces interact with each other, best practices, and trends. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5717.419s">The</a>  goal is to propose a sturdy, fair, transparent charter that provides a strong framework for our city government in the long term. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5726.563s">This</a>  holistic look at the charter is especially important in Medford because of how much time has passed since the last review. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5734.186s">As</a>  the blueprint for how our city government operates, the charter is a vitally important document that affects every person who lives in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5742.845s">Now,</a>  for the first time in decades, we are finally giving it a checkup, looking at our form of government, the balance of powers, the composition of our elected bodies, length and limits of terms for elected officials, budget procedures, mechanisms for citizen participation, and more. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5762.003s">I</a>  have heard this council reiterate many times that charter review should come from the people, and that is exactly what is happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5769.789s">We</a>  are all residents who volunteered for this task because we care about our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5774.913s">Our</a>  process prioritizes community engagement and input. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5778.856s">We</a>  will use the public feedback we collect to draft a proposal <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5783.519s">that</a>  must make its way through several portals, including this council, before ever becoming official. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5789.965s">The</a>  final step is at the ballot box with the voters. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5793.629s">The</a>  voters, the people, will have the final say. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5797.652s">Our</a>  webpage at www.medfordmad.org slash charter study has a wealth of information, including a form inviting public feedback. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5808.522s">You</a>  will find us at Circle the Square in June, the Farmer's Market in August, and other events around the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5814.605s">We</a>  will also be circulating a survey very soon. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5818.169s">But</a>  the main reason I'm here is to extend an invitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5821.392s">We</a>  are especially excited about our first public information and listening session this Thursday, June 8th at 7 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5829.541s">right</a>  here in City Hall Chambers. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5832.244s">All</a>  are welcome and encouraged to join us. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5834.967s">It's</a>  going to be fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5836.869s">regardless</a>  of which are events or meetings you can or cannot attend. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5841.092s">Your</a>  voice is important, and we want to hear from you, the residents of our city and the leaders of our city about your thoughts, hopes and dreams for our municipal government. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5852.1s">We</a>  hope to see you on Thursday evening right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5855.002s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/GqBzZH7qLmA&t=5856.423s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
