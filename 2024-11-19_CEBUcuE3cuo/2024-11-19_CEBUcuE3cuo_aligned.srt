Present.

12
00:00:19,218 --> 00:00:19,918

00:00:20,198 --> 00:00:20,579

00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:24,660
Present.

18
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,021
Please rise and exclude the plaque.

19
00:00:27,502 --> 00:00:37,514
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

20
00:00:37,534 --> 00:00:45,844
Pursuant to Governor Baker's March 12, 2020 order,

21
00:00:48,711 --> 00:00:58,316
of the open meeting law, ADA section 18 and the governor's March 15, 2020 order imposing strict limitation on the number of people that may gather in one place.

22
00:00:58,857 --> 00:01:05,100
This meeting of the Memphis City Council will be conducted via remote participation to the greatest extent possible.

23
00:01:06,081 --> 00:01:17,227
Specific information and the general guidelines for remote participation by members and of the public and parties with the right or requirement to attend this meeting can be found on the City of Memphis website

24
00:01:18,313 --> 00:01:20,855

00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:30,903
For accessing for this meeting, members of the public who wish to listen or watch the meeting may do so by accessing the meeting link contained herein.

27
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:41,011
via technological means.

28
00:01:41,472 --> 00:01:55,293
In the event we were able to do so, despite best efforts, we will post on the City of Medford or the Medford community website an audio or video recording transcript or other comprehensive record of proceedings as soon as possible after the meeting.

29
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:10,372
OK, before we start, I have a letter to read it to the record from the Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General.

30
00:02:11,733 --> 00:02:25,120
On or about June 25, 2020, a complaint was filed by Linda Julian with the Memphis City Council alleging a violation of the Open Meeting Law, Chapter 38, Section 18-25, General Law, Chapter 38, Section 23B, 940,

31
00:02:32,655 --> 00:02:37,118
Our office received the response from the council on July 14th, 2020.

32
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:53,092
After 30 days have passed since the complaint was filed with the public body, but within 90 days from the date of the alleged violation, a complaint may be filed with the division of open government for review, general law 30A section 23B 940-29056.

33
00:02:53,112 --> 00:02:54,813
We sent you an email on July 27th,

34
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:14,601
2020 saying that if we did not receive the original complaint and a request from you by September 18, 2020, we would presume the action taken by the council was sufficient and would close this file.

35
00:03:15,522 --> 00:03:20,547
Our office currently has no record of a request for further review from you in this matter.

36
00:03:20,627 --> 00:03:23,350
Therefore, we now consider this matter closed.

37
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:30,036
Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or if you believe anything stated in this letter to be accurate.

38
00:03:30,196 --> 00:03:34,000
Erica Warren, Massachusetts Office of the Attorney General.

39
00:03:34,020 --> 00:03:36,182
Mr. Clerk, if you could please read that into the records.

40
00:03:37,243 --> 00:03:38,264
Put it into the records.

41
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:43,278
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

42
00:03:43,298 --> 00:03:44,739
Mr. President, before you call for that?

43
00:03:45,379 --> 00:03:46,080
Vice President Mox.

44
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,341
I'm sorry, Councilor Mox.

45
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:49,162
Would I get a promotion?

46
00:03:49,182 --> 00:03:49,382
Yes.

47
00:03:49,702 --> 00:03:50,843
That's great.

48
00:03:50,883 --> 00:03:51,464
What does it pay?

49
00:03:52,044 --> 00:03:52,945
That's great.

50
00:03:54,066 --> 00:04:03,273
Mr. President, two weeks ago, this council voted unanimously to ask that we receive a weekly update from the Board of Health Director regarding phase one.

51
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:07,774
and phase two rollouts of the state and city vaccination.

52
00:04:07,874 --> 00:04:08,394
That is correct.

53
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:20,358
Mr. President, I would ask that every week prior to the motions, orders, and resolutions that we receive the update from the Director of the Board of Health.

54
00:04:21,018 --> 00:04:23,239
And I was wondering if she's on the call tonight, Mr. President.

55
00:04:31,263 --> 00:04:36,908
I do not see her on the call here.

56
00:04:36,928 --> 00:04:42,492
I do not, Councilor Moxley, she is not on the call.

57
00:04:45,355 --> 00:04:49,078
Okay, do we have anyone from the city administration on?

58
00:04:53,401 --> 00:04:55,383
We do not have anybody from the administration either.

59
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:07,336
So Mr. President, it was, I believe it was several months back, the council requested a monthly update.

60
00:05:08,237 --> 00:05:17,984
And now with the vaccination rollout and the importance of getting our seniors and first responders vaccinated,

61
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:21,747
that we requested that we receive weekly updates, Mr. President.

62
00:05:22,127 --> 00:05:23,708
I don't think that's a lot to ask.

63
00:05:24,329 --> 00:05:28,032
As we all know, this is an evolving subject.

64
00:05:28,432 --> 00:05:29,533
Every day it changes.

65
00:05:29,874 --> 00:05:31,375
New information comes out every day.

66
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:37,180
We heard today that potentially schools will be back sometime in April for the elementary schools.

67
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,701
on a full-time basis.

68
00:05:39,062 --> 00:05:46,851
So this is something very important, Mr. President, that we receive updates as well as the general public be informed, Mr. President.

69
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:49,014
And this is one avenue to do so.

70
00:05:49,034 --> 00:05:51,397
I'm not saying that this is the only avenue.

71
00:05:51,697 --> 00:05:52,498
It's one avenue.

72
00:05:52,878 --> 00:05:54,560
I am extremely disappointed

73
00:05:55,462 --> 00:06:03,031
that there is no one on from the Board of Health to give this council and give the residents of the community update.

74
00:06:03,092 --> 00:06:10,742
Mr. President, I still am receiving calls from seniors that are looking to get into the system.

75
00:06:11,202 --> 00:06:26,231
are waiting for the city of Method to open their site, which we heard now is probably not going to happen because they're going to more of a group effort with Melrose and Malden, Mr. President.

76
00:06:26,732 --> 00:06:39,580
But there are many seniors, I believe we got statistics, there are over 4,500 seniors that are over 75 that would be eligible for the injection, Mr. President, that live in the city of Method.

77
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:45,084
And it's important that we know, Mr. President, the outreach that's happening in this community.

78
00:06:45,845 --> 00:06:47,346
Are seniors being contacted?

79
00:06:47,746 --> 00:06:49,548
Are there a list?

80
00:06:49,648 --> 00:06:55,132
Is there a current list that the city of Method is working off of?

81
00:06:55,172 --> 00:06:56,333
What type of outreach?

82
00:06:56,413 --> 00:06:57,634
Are they reaching out to seniors?

83
00:06:57,955 --> 00:07:06,362
We can identify, we don't have to get into medical issues, Mr. President, but we can identify the population that's eligible.

84
00:07:06,742 --> 00:07:18,125
Now it's open for residents 65 to 74 that may have some other associated health risk also, Mr. President, and how many thousands more Method residents are eligible.

85
00:07:18,825 --> 00:07:24,026
I keep on getting phone calls from residents saying they can't make it to these other large state sites.

86
00:07:24,526 --> 00:07:27,627
They just don't have the bandwidth to get out to these sites.

87
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:32,430
And we're asking our most vulnerable population to go out to these mega sites.

88
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,412
They don't have the ability to get there.

89
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:43,079
They don't have the ability to stand in maybe hour long lines, which I had witnessed myself, Mr. President, over at Fenway Park.

90
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:48,681
Our long line, Mr. President, I think that's asking a lot of our seniors.

91
00:07:49,121 --> 00:07:51,802
And all we're asking for is a weekly update.

92
00:07:52,142 --> 00:07:59,144
So I would hope, Mr. President, if they're not on the call tonight, if they don't jump on tonight, that next Tuesday that we take up this again.

93
00:08:00,004 --> 00:08:03,347
before motions, orders, and resolutions are called, Mr. President.

94
00:08:03,487 --> 00:08:12,574
I will reach out to the board tomorrow to make sure that they either send us out a report or make sure that they're here for next week.

95
00:08:12,594 --> 00:08:13,335
No, no, no.

96
00:08:13,455 --> 00:08:14,836
I want someone, Mr. President.

97
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:15,917
We voted to have an update.

98
00:08:15,937 --> 00:08:17,578
I will make sure that someone is here next week.

99
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:19,419
Someone physically here to speak to us.

100
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:26,965
I don't think we're asking a lot of one of our department heads during a pandemic to give us an update, Mr. President.

101
00:08:27,085 --> 00:08:27,386
Thank you.

102
00:08:28,146 --> 00:08:29,488
Scott, I thank you for bringing this up.

103
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:30,869
Uh, Council marks.

104
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:37,015
I, too, prepared to just ask a simple question that had a few phone calls this weekend.

105
00:08:37,035 --> 00:08:40,839
I heard the rollout at the Andrews and all the volunteers were amazing.

106
00:08:41,424 --> 00:08:58,058
the program was a great turnout, but the confusion that I heard from many constituents after the fact that we're bringing their parents or trying to find appointments, that they saw a lot of, or they talked to a lot of people that weren't from the city of Medford.

107
00:08:58,698 --> 00:08:59,679
So that was a confusion.

108
00:08:59,719 --> 00:09:03,903
The confusion was they were told that people from Malden and Melrose

109
00:09:04,603 --> 00:09:04,883
were.

110
00:09:04,903 --> 00:09:12,773
And that should be something we should have someone from the administration or the Board of Health just to explain to our constituents what the benefit

111
00:09:14,077 --> 00:09:22,399
what the benefit by having a consolidated effort, like maybe that we can go to Melrose-Wakefield Method residents or vice versa, we don't know that.

112
00:09:23,059 --> 00:09:26,400
At least that's what the communications I got back from a few seniors.

113
00:09:26,420 --> 00:09:34,862
So if we can ask the Department of Health to have that answer ready for next week, I think to be helpful.

114
00:09:34,882 --> 00:09:35,222
Thank you.

115
00:09:35,342 --> 00:09:43,104
I will make sure that someone from the Board of Health is here next week to answer the questions in every week until

116
00:09:44,064 --> 00:09:45,465
until this is passed.

117
00:09:47,205 --> 00:09:47,526
Thank you.

118
00:09:47,646 --> 00:09:48,766
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

119
00:09:50,087 --> 00:10:04,813
Motions, orders, and resolutions 21069 offered by Vice President Knight, be it resolved that the Method City Council extend its deep and sincere condolences to the family of John Spike Lawless on his recent passing.

120
00:10:04,873 --> 00:10:05,574
Vice President Knight.

121
00:10:05,954 --> 00:10:07,595
Mr. President, thank you very much.

122
00:10:07,615 --> 00:10:08,235
Just recently,

123
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:10,636
friend Spike Law was passed away.

124
00:10:11,117 --> 00:10:14,759
Any of us that knew Spike knew what a great gentleman he was.

125
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:23,345
Cambridge firefighter retired established an organization to provide support among fellow firefighters for post-traumatic stress syndrome for

126
00:10:24,767 --> 00:10:32,035
Tragedies seen in the line of duty well before mental health was something that was talked about, Mr. President, a pioneer in the field of mental health and counseling.

127
00:10:32,976 --> 00:10:36,319
Mr. Lawless would be a fixture at St.

128
00:10:36,359 --> 00:10:43,307
Rayfield's Parish, West Medford Hillside, Little League, or bopping around town, down in West Medford Square, getting his Dunkin' Donuts.

129
00:10:44,117 --> 00:10:45,918
Um, and just recently we lost him.

130
00:10:46,318 --> 00:10:48,919
He's gone on to a better place, but he will be sadly missing Mr President.

131
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:55,861
He was a great father, a great friend, and he's someone that really give a lot to this community.

132
00:10:56,381 --> 00:11:01,683
And as we've all said before, um, each week we have condolences on the

133
00:11:03,214 --> 00:11:03,674
agenda.

134
00:11:04,595 --> 00:11:08,957
And each week it's a person that gave so much of themselves to making Medford a great place.

135
00:11:09,357 --> 00:11:15,301
And there's such a concern about when that next generation and next crop is going to come up and fill their shoes.

136
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:20,684
And if anybody is going to try to fill the shoes of Spike Lawless, they've got some pretty big shoes to fill, Mr. President.

137
00:11:21,024 --> 00:11:26,407
So I'd ask my colleagues to support this resolution in offering condolences to the family during this difficult time.

138
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:28,308
Thank you, Vice President.

139
00:11:30,282 --> 00:11:35,624
Okay, on the motion by Vice President Zain, seconded by Councilor Falco.

140
00:11:36,805 --> 00:11:39,446
Will you please rise and take a moment of silence.

141
00:11:54,372 --> 00:11:55,413
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

142
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,110
Councilor Behrs.

143
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:00,970
Yes.

144
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:02,671
Councilor Falco.

145
00:12:02,811 --> 00:12:03,051
Yes.

146
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:04,632
Vice President Knight.

147
00:12:04,712 --> 00:12:04,992
Yes.

148
00:12:05,232 --> 00:12:05,772
Councilor Marks.

149
00:12:06,072 --> 00:12:06,312
Yes.

150
00:12:06,752 --> 00:12:07,332
Councilor Morrell.

151
00:12:07,633 --> 00:12:07,853
Yes.

152
00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:09,533
Councilor Scarpelli.

153
00:12:09,793 --> 00:12:10,033
Yes.

154
00:12:10,093 --> 00:12:10,854
President Kerrio.

155
00:12:11,134 --> 00:12:11,354
Yes.

156
00:12:11,394 --> 00:12:12,734
So the affirmative motion passes.

157
00:12:12,754 --> 00:12:17,036
21070 offered by Councilor Behrs.

158
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:37,047
be resolved by the Memphis City Council that the city administration building department and health department provide an update on the complaints and inspections process for reporting health and safety issues for tenants and meet with the council to address ongoing problems and improve the system going forward.

159
00:12:37,067 --> 00:12:37,728
Councilor Best.

160
00:12:38,628 --> 00:12:39,569
Thank you, Mr. President.

161
00:12:39,709 --> 00:12:42,512
I put this resolution forward for a few reasons.

162
00:12:43,212 --> 00:12:43,733
One of them is

163
00:12:44,357 --> 00:12:49,780
the message we received from residents of the alpha management building at 53 to 63 Bellsway West.

164
00:12:50,120 --> 00:13:00,165
Um, but I'm also, since that came out, spoken with a lot of residents who have had some issues reporting, um, you know, health or safety concerns to the city and getting, uh, units inspected.

165
00:13:00,985 --> 00:13:10,350
Um, so I put this forward because, you know, we really need to make sure the city is fulfilling the responsibility that we have for inspections around safe and healthy housing.

166
00:13:11,159 --> 00:13:12,980
Um, we had made some initial progress.

167
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:24,589
Um, I spoke to the city administration last week, um, making it clear on the city website, how to report, um, a complaint and requested inspection, which we can now do, uh, through the online permitting service.

168
00:13:24,689 --> 00:13:27,031
So that is one item that has been improved.

169
00:13:27,651 --> 00:13:37,658
Um, but we do need to do more to make sure that the city has an effective, responsive and transparent system, uh, for making sure that residents can get health and safety inspections.

170
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:38,339
Um, so.

171
00:13:39,082 --> 00:13:43,224
I'm hoping we can look at the issue as a council and take action as the city.

172
00:13:44,084 --> 00:13:50,247
And I'm happy to report this either to the housing subcommittee or committee of the whole, whatever my fellow councilors would prefer.

173
00:13:51,307 --> 00:13:51,647
Thank you.

174
00:13:52,548 --> 00:13:54,249
Motion for the housing subcommittee, Mr. President.

175
00:13:55,149 --> 00:13:58,771
On the motion by Councilor Naif to refer this to the housing subcommittee.

176
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:01,692
Any further discussion on this?

177
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:13,662
Okay, on the motion by Councilor Behrs, seconded by Vice President Knight to refer this to the subcommittee on housing.

178
00:14:13,682 --> 00:14:14,963
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

179
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:18,206
Councilor Behrs?

180
00:14:18,786 --> 00:14:19,006
Yes.

181
00:14:19,987 --> 00:14:20,688
Councilor Falco?

182
00:14:20,848 --> 00:14:21,048
Yes.

183
00:14:21,428 --> 00:14:22,169
Vice President Knight?

184
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:22,549
Yes.

185
00:14:22,789 --> 00:14:23,389
Councilor Marks?

186
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:23,950
Yes.

187
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:24,891
Councilor Morrell?

188
00:14:25,211 --> 00:14:25,451
Yes.

189
00:14:26,452 --> 00:14:27,232
Councilor Scarpelli?

190
00:14:27,653 --> 00:14:27,973
Yes.

191
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:28,833
President Kerrio?

192
00:14:29,114 --> 00:14:30,815
Yes, I'm in the affirmative, motion passes.

193
00:14:32,632 --> 00:14:47,743
21701 offered by Councilor Baez, be it resolved by the Memphis City Council that the city administration through the building department and health department address the serious health and safety problems reported by residents at Alpha Management Properties on Fellsway West.

194
00:14:48,144 --> 00:14:48,804
Councilor Baez.

195
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:50,766
Thank you, Mr. President.

196
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:52,347
Along a similar vein,

197
00:14:53,043 --> 00:15:04,367
This is specifically requesting an update on the issues at 5363 Fells Way West, and I'm hoping to get that update promptly so residents can make sure they're living in safe and healthy conditions.

198
00:15:05,367 --> 00:15:05,987
Thank you.

199
00:15:06,187 --> 00:15:06,927
And I move approval.

200
00:15:08,948 --> 00:15:10,008
Any further discussion on that?

201
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:11,909
Hearing and seeing none.

202
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:17,831
On the motion by Councilor Beers, seconded by Vice President Knight.

203
00:15:18,831 --> 00:15:20,191
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

204
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:21,072
Councilor Beers?

205
00:15:21,672 --> 00:15:21,852
Yes.

206
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:23,560
Councilor Falco?

207
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:23,940
Yes.

208
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:24,941
Vice President Knight?

209
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:25,661
Yes.

210
00:15:25,961 --> 00:15:26,561
Councilor Marks?

211
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:27,061
Yes.

212
00:15:27,341 --> 00:15:28,022
Councilor Morrell?

213
00:15:28,342 --> 00:15:28,562
Yes.

214
00:15:29,522 --> 00:15:30,322
Councilor Scarpelli?

215
00:15:30,482 --> 00:15:30,742
Yes.

216
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:31,823
President Caravaglia?

217
00:15:31,863 --> 00:15:32,043
Yes.

218
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:33,603
Seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

219
00:15:34,484 --> 00:15:36,624
21072, offered by Councilor Bez.

220
00:15:37,365 --> 00:15:48,008
Being resolved by the Memphis City Council, that the city administration submit public comments to the FAA regarding airplane noise reduction prior to the March 15th deadline for submission.

221
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:48,988
Councilor Bez.

222
00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:51,089
Thank you, Mr. President.

223
00:15:52,218 --> 00:16:07,222
As I think we're all very aware, airplane noise has been a severe issue across Medford, especially since the FAA implemented new flight path rules that really channel most of the traffic leaving Logan Airport to the north, right over Medford's residential neighborhoods.

224
00:16:07,902 --> 00:16:21,005
There is a new federal administration with President Biden, Secretary of Transportation Buttigieg, and there is a public comment period currently open at the FAA to allow input around airplane noise.

225
00:16:22,715 --> 00:16:34,259
And I would like the city administration to submit public comments to that public comment period, indicating that we need relief from the excessive airplane noise that we're seeing in Medford.

226
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:35,940
And I move approval.

227
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:37,400
Thank you, Councilor Behrs.

228
00:16:37,981 --> 00:16:38,681
Councilor Morrell.

229
00:16:39,301 --> 00:16:40,141
Thank you, Mr. President.

230
00:16:40,501 --> 00:16:42,522
And I want to thank Councilor Behrs for bringing this forward.

231
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:50,145
I was able to attend one of the recent community meetings that the FAA hosted earlier this month

232
00:16:50,693 --> 00:17:18,796
And I was very dismayed to see representatives from the FAA kind of discount a lot of the very legitimate complaints and issues that people in Medford and surrounding communities have, citing that, you know, planes are quieter and ignoring the fact of why Medford is in such a difficult spot with the RNAV change and the constant onslaught and planes going over the same path over and over and over that it doesn't matter if they're a little bit quieter than they were in 1970 when you have, you know, one every minute.

233
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:19,803
That doesn't matter.

234
00:17:19,863 --> 00:17:31,611
So I thank Councilor Behrs for bringing this forward because clearly this agency really needs to hear from voices in Medford and beyond that this is a real problem and not something that they can ignore or try to explain away anymore.

235
00:17:31,812 --> 00:17:34,393
So thanks to Councilor Behrs and this has my support.

236
00:17:35,114 --> 00:17:45,561
And we do have some responses from the mayor in your package this week from both the FAA and different other departments.

237
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:48,463
So there is a response.

238
00:17:49,663 --> 00:17:50,384
Any further questions?

239
00:17:50,524 --> 00:17:58,327
I'd like to amend the paper to request that a copy be forwarded to Massport and CAC reps, so that they're aware of the council action.

240
00:17:58,608 --> 00:17:59,128
As amended.

241
00:17:59,988 --> 00:18:00,969
To forward a copy.

242
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:01,609
Okay.

243
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:04,431
On the motion by Councilor Behrs.

244
00:18:04,631 --> 00:18:05,151
Second.

245
00:18:05,651 --> 00:18:06,932
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

246
00:18:10,374 --> 00:18:11,974
As amended by Councilor Knight.

247
00:18:14,175 --> 00:18:15,656
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

248
00:18:17,517 --> 00:18:18,137
Councilor Behrs.

249
00:18:18,758 --> 00:18:18,958
Yes.

250
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:20,658
Councilor Falcone.

251
00:18:20,718 --> 00:18:20,958
Yes.

252
00:18:21,418 --> 00:18:21,899
Vice President.

253
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:22,479
Yes.

254
00:18:22,739 --> 00:18:23,340
Councilmarks.

255
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:24,080
Yes.

256
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:24,981
Councilor Morrell.

257
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:25,701
Yes.

258
00:18:27,042 --> 00:18:27,803
Councilor Scarpelli.

259
00:18:27,963 --> 00:18:28,263
Yes.

260
00:18:28,663 --> 00:18:29,364
President Caravaglia.

261
00:18:29,464 --> 00:18:29,664
Yes.

262
00:18:30,244 --> 00:18:31,625
Motion passes.

263
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:48,697
21073 offered by Councilor Morrell being so resolved that the city administration provide an update to the city council on CARES Act expenditures used for contract tracing, vaccination, and other COVID related expenses as referenced

264
00:18:49,194 --> 00:18:50,995
in the Q2 Finance Update.

265
00:18:51,015 --> 00:18:51,735
Councilor Morrell.

266
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:53,716
Thank you, Mr. President.

267
00:18:53,776 --> 00:19:07,481
As this resolution indicates, this is something that was raised at the Q2 meeting last week, I believe, where we had a brief overview slide that referenced $2.1 million of CARES Act funding that had not been yet specifically assigned or allocated by city departments.

268
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:16,344
And I'm just requesting that we get an update on how this is being spent for the purposes which were referenced, which was COVID-related spending, vaccination and contact tracing,

269
00:19:17,086 --> 00:19:20,289
The chief of staff did note that things change so frequently.

270
00:19:20,349 --> 00:19:25,633
This is something that's hard to, I guess, give a long-term or really looking forward report on.

271
00:19:25,973 --> 00:19:32,719
So I'm just asking that we get an up-to-date report on this as soon as possible, as we know where this money is proposed to be going.

272
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:33,879
And I move approval.

273
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,481
Thank you.

274
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:36,562
Second.

275
00:19:36,622 --> 00:19:38,543
Any further discussion, please?

276
00:19:38,563 --> 00:19:41,626
The motion by Councilor Morrell, seconded by Councilor Bares.

277
00:19:41,666 --> 00:19:42,786
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

278
00:19:44,448 --> 00:19:45,048
Councilor Bares.

279
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:45,729
Yes.

280
00:19:46,937 --> 00:19:47,618
Councilor Felco.

281
00:19:47,658 --> 00:19:47,918
Yes.

282
00:19:48,278 --> 00:19:49,059
Vice President Knight.

283
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,479
Yes.

284
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:50,460
Councilor Marks.

285
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:50,800
Yes.

286
00:19:51,181 --> 00:19:51,821
Councilor Morrell.

287
00:19:52,141 --> 00:19:52,382
Yes.

288
00:19:53,382 --> 00:19:54,143
Councilor Scarpelli.

289
00:19:54,363 --> 00:19:54,603
Yes.

290
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:55,644
President Kerrio.

291
00:19:55,684 --> 00:20:00,528
Yes, seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

292
00:20:00,548 --> 00:20:11,718
21074, offered by Councilor Scarpelli, being resolved that our city, state, and federal leaders stand together and express the urgency of making our teachers a priority for COVID vaccinations.

293
00:20:12,098 --> 00:20:13,019
Councilor Scarpelli.

294
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:14,020
Thank you, Mr. President.

295
00:20:14,828 --> 00:20:31,311
There's been a lot of movement, especially in the last 24 hours with the governor proclaiming and the head of the board of education that we're going to, at least for the younger grades, to full in-school learning for our elementary school students.

296
00:20:31,451 --> 00:20:42,553
And did a little research and just seeing the support of many different medical professionals talking about the,

297
00:20:45,038 --> 00:20:55,709
the safety of our children and that they are limited in transmitting the virus.

298
00:20:56,029 --> 00:20:59,733
But I think the biggest concern is our teachers.

299
00:21:00,895 --> 00:21:04,138
Sometimes it's a more elderly population and

300
00:21:04,851 --> 00:21:08,292
Our veteran teachers are afraid to come back, and we can understand why.

301
00:21:08,992 --> 00:21:10,272
We do want to get back to school.

302
00:21:10,492 --> 00:21:15,773
I'm one of the parents that want to see teachers back in the classroom, but this is a simple fix.

303
00:21:17,893 --> 00:21:29,975
If we moved all of our first responders to the front of the line, and we want to reopen our schools, there's no reason why we shouldn't have our teachers moved right to that front of that line.

304
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,436
So it's a little disheartening.

305
00:21:33,587 --> 00:21:41,290
The good news, I can go get my vaccine shot because I'm a little overweight.

306
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:53,356
I don't know if you noticed that, but that's a positive, but our teachers that are going to be educating our students need to feel comfortable and safe.

307
00:21:53,916 --> 00:22:02,960
And I think it's important that we start putting our teachers as a priority and that we reach out to all of our team members and government

308
00:22:03,663 --> 00:22:08,566
and really stress the governor that the teachers need to be put to the head of the line.

309
00:22:08,626 --> 00:22:22,056
So I ask this for my colleagues to support, and I hope that we can move quickly to try to get this important demographic taken care of.

310
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:22,876
Our teachers need it.

311
00:22:22,896 --> 00:22:23,316
Thank you.

312
00:22:23,897 --> 00:22:24,477
Councilor Beasley.

313
00:22:25,998 --> 00:22:26,979
Thank you, Mr. President.

314
00:22:27,019 --> 00:22:30,541
I wanna thank Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on our agenda tonight.

315
00:22:31,462 --> 00:22:32,703
I think this is really essential

316
00:22:33,136 --> 00:22:48,023
I think we've actually heard from most, if not all teachers and teachers unions as well, that they would like to have a good plan in place to get back into the classroom and start addressing some of the mental health impacts that have happened with schools being closed for so long.

317
00:22:49,584 --> 00:22:52,485
But it is also simultaneously very frustrating.

318
00:22:52,525 --> 00:23:00,709
There's a study out today that says the main driver of COVID spread in schools is the adults, the educators, not the students.

319
00:23:02,292 --> 00:23:15,899
However, the CDC is saying it's safe to be in the building if you have social distancing, if you have masking, if you can follow these safety protocols, which kind of conflicts with the idea of going back five days a week with everybody in the classroom.

320
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:21,582
It's very difficult to follow social distancing and safety protocols if you have 30 students in a single classroom.

321
00:23:22,163 --> 00:23:29,167
So I really think it's more essential than ever that teachers are moved to the front of this list, especially if the governor's proposals

322
00:23:30,517 --> 00:23:32,879
for April reopening start to go forward.

323
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,803
So thank you, Councilor Scarpelli, and I second your motion.

324
00:23:37,204 --> 00:23:37,524
Thank you.

325
00:23:38,906 --> 00:23:39,586
Councilor Falco.

326
00:23:39,767 --> 00:23:40,668
Thank you, Mr. President.

327
00:23:40,688 --> 00:23:43,430
I also want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward.

328
00:23:44,051 --> 00:23:45,132
Very important issue.

329
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:52,540
You know, Desi's pushing for full-time return to in-school, full return to in-person learning.

330
00:23:53,331 --> 00:23:57,952
And this can't be achieved without significant changes in our social distancing guidelines.

331
00:23:58,632 --> 00:24:03,934
And we know that adults more often are seriously affected by the coronavirus.

332
00:24:04,514 --> 00:24:10,575
And we need to ensure that they, our teachers, are vaccinated before they return to the classroom full time.

333
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:13,996
Teachers want to be in person with their students teaching.

334
00:24:14,656 --> 00:24:16,316
Your parents want their children at school.

335
00:24:16,957 --> 00:24:21,678
We need to make sure that teachers have the ability to get vaccinated.

336
00:24:21,838 --> 00:24:23,118
Teachers are essential.

337
00:24:25,481 --> 00:24:30,402
The protection of their health needs to be prioritized and they do need to be vaccinated.

338
00:24:32,703 --> 00:24:45,705
If you take a look around our country, there are 28 states that have prioritized teacher vaccination and the state of Massachusetts still has not prioritized teacher vaccinations.

339
00:24:47,106 --> 00:24:48,846
It's kind of like almost a recurring theme.

340
00:24:48,926 --> 00:24:52,907
I feel like the state of Massachusetts is trailing from behind and usually

341
00:24:54,068 --> 00:24:58,449
In most other instances, we're at the top of the pack, we're at the front of the pack, we're leading the way.

342
00:24:58,469 --> 00:25:01,410
And I feel like time after time now we're falling behind.

343
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:07,713
And I think this is an issue where we're not, we should be up in front, we should be getting our teachers vaccinated and we're not.

344
00:25:08,493 --> 00:25:12,634
So I thank Councilor Scott Pelley for bringing this forward, and I would also move approval.

345
00:25:12,934 --> 00:25:13,274
Thank you.

346
00:25:13,454 --> 00:25:13,835
Thank you.

347
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:14,575
Councilor Morocco.

348
00:25:16,235 --> 00:25:17,016
Thank you, Mr. President.

349
00:25:17,036 --> 00:25:20,937
I also wanna thank Councilor Scott Pelley for introducing this and for his prescience.

350
00:25:21,811 --> 00:25:28,074
seeing the news coming out at the state level today being more important than ever, this being more important than ever.

351
00:25:28,094 --> 00:25:35,357
I know, just echoing what's already been said, is I know students want to get back, I know teachers want to get back, and they want to do so safely.

352
00:25:35,377 --> 00:25:42,221
I do just also want to note that, as I understand this, school committee passed a resolution to this effect earlier this month.

353
00:25:42,721 --> 00:25:48,584
So if this passes the council, I think it's a great effort in showing a united front and united voices pushing for this.

354
00:25:49,952 --> 00:25:52,454
This has my support, and again, thanks to Councilor Scarpelli.

355
00:25:54,255 --> 00:25:54,676
Thank you.

356
00:25:55,496 --> 00:26:01,621
On the motion by Councilor Behrs, I'm assuming, by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Behrs.

357
00:26:02,182 --> 00:26:03,483
Mr. Clerk, please call the motion.

358
00:26:03,503 --> 00:26:04,944
Councilor Moxley, do you want to speak?

359
00:26:04,964 --> 00:26:05,904
Just briefly, Mr. President.

360
00:26:05,945 --> 00:26:07,526
I'm sorry, Councilor Moxley.

361
00:26:07,586 --> 00:26:08,266
Thank you, Mr. President.

362
00:26:08,286 --> 00:26:12,850
I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli and the comments of my colleagues.

363
00:26:13,517 --> 00:26:20,822
I fully agree with teachers should be listed as essential workers.

364
00:26:21,562 --> 00:26:30,007
They are essential workers when they're dealing in teaching our kids and by no stretch of the imagination, so they could be considered otherwise.

365
00:26:30,928 --> 00:26:42,995
It was stated by the governor just recently that the inability for them to have the visibility of how many injections they're gonna get in from the state

366
00:26:43,357 --> 00:26:53,341
on a weekly basis is the inhibitor right now with rolling this out to teachers and to other people that may be in need of the injection.

367
00:26:54,021 --> 00:27:05,626
And the governor was requesting that the federal government give at least a three or four week window on what we're gonna get for vaccinations, the number of vaccinations.

368
00:27:05,946 --> 00:27:09,648
And that'll enable us at our sites, our mass vaccination sites,

369
00:27:10,112 --> 00:27:19,514
to roll this out more effectively and efficiently and be able to have people book one, two, three, four weeks out at a time, which is currently not happening right now.

370
00:27:19,894 --> 00:27:38,257
So some of its logistics, Mr. President, and I would ask as part of this that we also send a correspondence to our federal delegation asking that they at least give some more visibility and insight on the number of injections we're gonna get as a state

371
00:27:38,650 --> 00:27:46,337
So when we roll out our plan, that we're able to plan for it and book residents and teachers in advance, Mr. President.

372
00:27:46,718 --> 00:27:52,423
I would also ask that the school committee show leadership.

373
00:27:53,064 --> 00:27:56,347
And once again, Mr. President, meet in a public setting.

374
00:27:57,146 --> 00:28:03,270
You know, we're going to be asking teachers, we're going to be asking students to get back into the classroom, Mr. President.

375
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:10,795
And I think it's only appropriate that the school committee lead by example, Mr. President, and have their meetings held in a public setting.

376
00:28:11,115 --> 00:28:11,475
Thank you.

377
00:28:13,016 --> 00:28:13,737
Thank you.

378
00:28:15,258 --> 00:28:20,041
On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelli, seconded by Councilor Baird.

379
00:28:20,061 --> 00:28:21,242
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

380
00:28:23,703 --> 00:28:24,864
As amended by Councilor Marx.

381
00:28:26,808 --> 00:28:27,428
Councilor Beres.

382
00:28:29,829 --> 00:28:33,971
What's the amendment from Councilor Marks, just so I'm aware?

383
00:28:34,251 --> 00:28:35,231
I believe there are two.

384
00:28:35,951 --> 00:28:41,994
Correspondence to the federal delegation requesting more insight on the number of vaccinations that are gonna be available in Massachusetts.

385
00:28:42,494 --> 00:28:44,895
The number of vaccinations in advance.

386
00:28:45,255 --> 00:28:45,755
In advance.

387
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:47,676
That will be available.

388
00:28:48,036 --> 00:28:49,336
That'll help for planning.

389
00:28:50,817 --> 00:28:53,978
And then was your request to the school committee, was that also an amendment?

390
00:28:54,218 --> 00:28:55,839
That wasn't an amendment, that was just a comment.

391
00:28:58,078 --> 00:28:58,778
So that was the yes.

392
00:29:01,859 --> 00:29:02,539
Councilor Falcone.

393
00:29:02,999 --> 00:29:03,259
Yes.

394
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:04,800
Vice President Knight.

395
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:06,420
Councilor Marks.

396
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:06,980
Yes.

397
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:08,600
Councilor Morrell.

398
00:29:08,961 --> 00:29:09,241
Yes.

399
00:29:10,301 --> 00:29:11,041
Councilor Scarpelli.

400
00:29:11,281 --> 00:29:11,621
Yes.

401
00:29:11,861 --> 00:29:12,661
President Kerrio.

402
00:29:12,841 --> 00:29:13,062
Yes.

403
00:29:13,162 --> 00:29:15,022
I mean affirmative motion passes.

404
00:29:18,103 --> 00:29:21,924
21075 offered by Councilor Falcone, Councilor Scarpelli.

405
00:29:23,564 --> 00:29:27,905
We resolved that the parks department in conjunction with the recreation department

406
00:29:28,355 --> 00:29:32,516
retrofit each city tennis courts for pickleball use.

407
00:29:32,656 --> 00:29:33,476
Councilor Falco.

408
00:29:34,196 --> 00:29:35,396
Thank you, Mr. President.

409
00:29:35,416 --> 00:29:39,877
I received a number of calls over the past week regarding pickleball.

410
00:29:39,977 --> 00:29:44,398
Pickleball is gaining a lot of popularity.

411
00:29:44,638 --> 00:29:48,519
It's been around for many years, but I think in our area, it's gaining popularity.

412
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:54,260
And from what I've been told, it's gaining a lot of popularity with our senior residents.

413
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:59,512
similar to tennis, but not quite like tennis, it's similar to tennis.

414
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:05,075
And like I said, it's become very popular.

415
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:09,137
But currently our parks are lined for pickleball.

416
00:30:09,297 --> 00:30:19,483
So what this resolution is, is actually it's an attempt to basically have our parks lined for pickleball use.

417
00:30:20,573 --> 00:30:22,974
I watched a meeting that was held by the administration last week.

418
00:30:23,034 --> 00:30:25,995
It was an update with regards to our parks and open space.

419
00:30:26,755 --> 00:30:32,957
And I believe one of the courts at Duggar Park is going to be lined for pickleball sometime in the future.

420
00:30:32,977 --> 00:30:43,901
And it was also recommended that when Carr Park is reconstructed or renovated, that they will have some sort of a pickleball court for use.

421
00:30:44,627 --> 00:30:55,970
know, if you take a look at the city of Medford, you know, we have many parks, many parks throughout our community, and all different sections of the city, all different neighborhoods, and we pride ourselves on our parks and open space.

422
00:30:56,710 --> 00:31:07,232
And, you know, so what this resolution is, it's basically a proposal that all of our tennis courts be lined to retrofitted so that they can be used for pickleball.

423
00:31:07,252 --> 00:31:12,834
The way I look at it is this would open up use for pickleball and make our our

424
00:31:18,451 --> 00:31:23,612
it would give the availability for people to play pickleball in any neighborhood, not just have to go to one particular park.

425
00:31:24,573 --> 00:31:31,714
And one of the people that he did talk to, he had also mentioned that, they felt that there should be more programming for seniors.

426
00:31:31,774 --> 00:31:37,776
And I think this is a great opportunity to have programming for our seniors and to have pickleball throughout the city of Medford.

427
00:31:38,556 --> 00:31:41,157
So when I asked that my counselors,

428
00:31:41,957 --> 00:31:47,898
support this resolution, and I know Councilor Scott Pelli has a few words to say about this as well.

429
00:31:47,918 --> 00:31:51,199
So at this point, I'd turn it over to my council colleague, Councilor Scott.

430
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:52,619
Councilor Scott Pelli.

431
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:58,120
Thank you, Mr. President, and thanks, Councilor Falco, for really putting this issue forward.

432
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:09,803
I think that, you know, in my field, we see, in recreation, we see how important it is, especially today with the pandemic, trying to get especially a demographic that's not being

433
00:32:10,543 --> 00:32:21,690
serviced in a sense as our seniors and finding recreational activities that are pretty inexpensive and an easy fix if you allow it.

434
00:32:23,030 --> 00:32:34,857
Talking to the director of recreation this past week, Kevin Bailey, I know we have a great and highly successful football program through recreation and an outside organization.

435
00:32:35,418 --> 00:32:39,020
And they really started groundswell here in our community

436
00:32:39,732 --> 00:32:46,173
like you're seeing in other communities that are giving constituents an opportunity to play.

437
00:32:46,233 --> 00:33:03,417
What that has also happened is that recreation organized program is great, but what we're seeing is we're seeing constituents that just want to go down the park and bring their paddles and go over to a tennis court and just have a pickup game.

438
00:33:03,857 --> 00:33:07,418
So with that, what Councilor Falco is mentioning,

439
00:33:08,733 --> 00:33:37,503
You know, I know that we heard some concerns that if you paint the courts, you know, that it'll affect X, Y, and Z, but just like other sports and other sports facilities, there's a way to do that where you are using temporary paint, using a different color, so you're really not affecting the tennis court itself, but also giving an opportunity for, you know, our participants in pickleball

440
00:33:37,916 --> 00:33:40,377
to have an opportunity to play in their neighborhood.

441
00:33:41,938 --> 00:33:56,683
So I think that we can end up becoming the Mecca of pickleball here in Medford will be the talk of every town and there'll be pickleball played across the land.

442
00:33:58,284 --> 00:34:06,587
So, but I know that, you know, another option that if we can look at too, I know that some communities

443
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:10,435
participate in pickleball on turf fields.

444
00:34:11,656 --> 00:34:15,399
It's recommended to play on, from what I was told, on the tennis courts.

445
00:34:15,459 --> 00:34:26,048
But if you see that it's really growing to that extent, there's other areas that we can facilitate pickleball courts.

446
00:34:26,088 --> 00:34:29,451
But again, this is great.

447
00:34:29,491 --> 00:34:35,536
We started off with what we're seeing in our community with a bocce court that needs to be revisited a little bit.

448
00:34:36,047 --> 00:34:39,348
maybe take up the sand to put some stone dust, I guess, Mr. President.

449
00:34:39,868 --> 00:34:58,652
But I think that when you're adding these type of recreational activities, the people that in the past have been pushing aside, you know, I remember when our seniors only recreational activity was walking around Meadowblend Mall 455 times and then getting a coffee in the food court.

450
00:34:58,712 --> 00:35:03,273
But, you know, this is what our constituents are asking for.

451
00:35:03,333 --> 00:35:03,913
And I think that,

452
00:35:04,842 --> 00:35:08,864
I appreciate Councilor Falco to bring this forward so we can help this move along.

453
00:35:08,925 --> 00:35:12,447
And like I said, this isn't a big budget issue.

454
00:35:12,827 --> 00:35:16,469
This could be a very easy fix and it should be celebrated.

455
00:35:16,509 --> 00:35:17,029
So thank you.

456
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:18,110
Thank you.

457
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:18,891
Councilor Morocco.

458
00:35:20,992 --> 00:35:21,752
Thank you, Mr. President.

459
00:35:21,772 --> 00:35:26,815
Yeah, I just wanted to confirm if I could through the chair, I did some research on pickleball this weekend.

460
00:35:27,196 --> 00:35:30,297
And so I thank the councilors for the opportunity to do such.

461
00:35:30,638 --> 00:35:32,319
I just want to confirm, so this would just be,

462
00:35:33,381 --> 00:35:37,803
changing markings and paint, it doesn't have to change the netting at all through the chair?

463
00:35:38,923 --> 00:35:40,844
No, I don't play pickleball, so I don't know.

464
00:35:41,244 --> 00:35:43,605
No, you don't really, you don't have to.

465
00:35:44,706 --> 00:35:51,088
From what we gather, you don't have to, so I don't think it's something that's, it's, you know, it's that dire.

466
00:35:51,749 --> 00:35:52,089
Okay.

467
00:35:52,809 --> 00:35:54,029
I think it's appropriate.

468
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:55,510
Okay, thank you.

469
00:35:56,210 --> 00:35:57,491
I know we have some speakers.

470
00:35:57,571 --> 00:35:58,952
If I may, really quick.

471
00:36:00,782 --> 00:36:05,345
I believe there may be a few people that may want to speak on this issue on the call.

472
00:36:05,585 --> 00:36:11,789
Councilor Knight.

473
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:13,670
Thank you, Mr. President.

474
00:36:13,690 --> 00:36:16,312
I just wanted to thank my fellow colleagues for putting this on the agenda.

475
00:36:17,352 --> 00:36:19,574
And you know, if we paint these lines, the people will come.

476
00:36:19,674 --> 00:36:21,955
So I think that's a great way to think about it.

477
00:36:22,115 --> 00:36:23,536
And I'm fully in support of this.

478
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,818
I'm happy to defer to my fellow councilor.

479
00:36:26,658 --> 00:36:27,419
Mr. President Knight.

480
00:36:27,939 --> 00:36:29,200
Mr. President, thank you very much.

481
00:36:30,857 --> 00:36:34,518
Sure come a long way from playing street hockey at Playstead Park, huh?

482
00:36:35,019 --> 00:36:35,399
Wow.

483
00:36:35,919 --> 00:36:40,501
Sean Bates, Joe Sacco, David Sacco, Keith Tkachuk, Mike Morrison.

484
00:36:41,201 --> 00:36:46,363
I don't know of any famous pickleball players, Mr. President, but maybe Medford will be on the forefront of that as well.

485
00:36:47,524 --> 00:36:51,425
I've always been a strong supporter of expanding our recreational opportunities.

486
00:36:52,205 --> 00:36:57,107
And I've always been a strong supporter in providing various opportunities.

487
00:36:57,447 --> 00:36:58,868
And I don't understand why we can't make

488
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:12,991
The majority of our courts in this community are multifunctional, Mr. President, between tennis, badminton, street hockey, pickleball, or whatever it's called here, basketball, adjustable rims, that type of stuff, Mr. President.

489
00:37:13,211 --> 00:37:18,652
We have a plethora of parkland in this community, more so than our neighboring towns.

490
00:37:19,452 --> 00:37:25,173
And that provides us with a unique opportunity to really expand our recreational programming

491
00:37:25,717 --> 00:37:29,621
I'm very happy with the work that the Recreation Department has been doing, Mr. President.

492
00:37:29,921 --> 00:37:40,250
I would like to see maybe a adult basketball league, night league in the summer, a few things like that that I think could be real low-hanging fruit.

493
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:48,297
If you look at the success that they had over in Somerville with their Trump Field basketball league that they had over there for 40 years, the park was packed every single night.

494
00:37:48,317 --> 00:37:52,280
And I think that these are initiatives that we can pursue, and pickleball is one of them.

495
00:37:52,884 --> 00:37:54,665
So I thank my colleagues for putting this on.

496
00:37:55,266 --> 00:38:02,790
You know, I apologize to my street hockey playing friends that are going to be bumped off, bumped off our tennis courts, but this is something I support a lot of me.

497
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:03,671
I thank my colleagues.

498
00:38:04,652 --> 00:38:05,572
Thank you, Vice President.

499
00:38:05,993 --> 00:38:09,255
I see we have, Paul C has his hand up.

500
00:38:09,295 --> 00:38:11,236
Paul C, name and address of the record, please.

501
00:38:14,778 --> 00:38:15,158
Unmute.

502
00:38:15,899 --> 00:38:18,801
Getting used to this Zoom stuff, Mr. President.

503
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:21,863
Paul Camuso, 114 Lincoln Road, Medford, Mass.

504
00:38:23,453 --> 00:38:39,905
First of all, I want to thank Councilor Falco and Councilor Scott Pelli for putting this on, you know, as, as a former athlete at Medford High School, I love to see that we're trying diverse to diversify the athletic programs and the recreational programs in our community.

505
00:38:40,246 --> 00:38:42,167
Just a few years ago we were very lucky to.

506
00:38:43,208 --> 00:38:50,855
get the recreation department into full swing, you know, and to expand it to include more diverse opportunities for Medford residents.

507
00:38:51,176 --> 00:38:53,338
It's just a win-win, Mr. President.

508
00:38:54,038 --> 00:39:04,128
I really think that this is going to take off, you know, you look at the Barchi court, the old Italian Americans love Barchi for the most part, and a lot of other people are now becoming

509
00:39:04,608 --> 00:39:10,631
part of that bocce league at not only the boat club, but also the new bocce courts here in our community.

510
00:39:11,131 --> 00:39:21,895
For many, many years, people would go over to the Italian club over in Malden to participate in bocce and to see bocce and now pickleball come to fruition, I think it's a great opportunity for our residents.

511
00:39:22,555 --> 00:39:25,977
Furthermore, just on a side note, we have a lot of snowbirds in our community.

512
00:39:26,557 --> 00:39:33,581
The biggest voting blocks and the biggest group in this community, when you look at the numbers, are the senior citizens.

513
00:39:33,942 --> 00:39:38,925
And to give them more opportunity to enjoy their golden years of retirement, I think you have to do it.

514
00:39:39,305 --> 00:39:41,666
And I really appreciate you making an effort to put this in place.

515
00:39:42,587 --> 00:39:45,589
On another side note, my mom is a snowbird, as most of you know.

516
00:39:46,049 --> 00:39:51,632
And down in Naples, they actually have a tournament that brings in thousands upon thousands of people that play.

517
00:39:52,093 --> 00:39:54,734
And they actually set up professional pickleball courts.

518
00:39:54,834 --> 00:39:55,615
It's a big facility.

519
00:39:56,195 --> 00:40:12,339
And three years ago when I visited my mom, I never even heard of pickleball, but it certainly is something that's taken off, not only here, but down in Florida where the retirees go down and enjoy the nice warm winters that we unfortunately don't have up here.

520
00:40:12,759 --> 00:40:14,199
So I just wanted to go on record.

521
00:40:14,219 --> 00:40:21,881
If I could too, as a former member of the council and a parent of a student in the Medford Public Schools, I think it's very important.

522
00:40:21,921 --> 00:40:25,102
I used to put this on yearly when I was a member of your honorable body.

523
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:37,411
but I think the safety audit of all the parks to make sure, especially now, because once the parks are up and running, I think you're gonna have more people out there this year than ever due to the fact of the COVID-19 situation.

524
00:40:37,811 --> 00:40:50,300
So if you could, somebody think about putting on the agenda or making a paper to have the parks department do the safety audit, just to go through the entire facility structures and check all the nuts and bolts so that we can prevent injuries.

525
00:40:50,340 --> 00:40:50,781
I think it's a,

526
00:40:51,501 --> 00:41:01,966
no win, it's a win-win for the community and we can't go wrong when we're trying to provide safety to the senior citizens and in this particular case, the youth of our community.

527
00:41:02,046 --> 00:41:05,668
So once again, thank you to Councilor Falco and Councilor Scott Pelley.

528
00:41:06,349 --> 00:41:10,691
I like when you guys think outside the box, you get down there on Tuesday night and you do the people's business.

529
00:41:11,271 --> 00:41:13,232
So I really appreciate that.

530
00:41:13,612 --> 00:41:14,653
And on another note,

531
00:41:15,333 --> 00:41:16,614
You guys are showing leadership.

532
00:41:17,154 --> 00:41:28,821
You're showing people that the country can still move forward under this devastating vaccine program that's before us now in the COVID situation by showing up on Tuesday nights and getting the people's business done.

533
00:41:29,161 --> 00:41:32,243
The continuity of government has to be paramount.

534
00:41:33,323 --> 00:41:34,824
And the people that are there tonight are doing that.

535
00:41:34,884 --> 00:41:35,204
Thank you.

536
00:41:36,685 --> 00:41:37,706
Thank you, Mr. Musso.

537
00:41:38,466 --> 00:41:40,527
Any further questions from the public?

538
00:41:44,009 --> 00:41:44,890
I don't think I see any.

539
00:41:46,182 --> 00:41:52,223
Okay, Councilor Scott.

540
00:41:52,423 --> 00:42:13,728
If I can, if we can just amend the paper to, if we can call for a subcommittee meeting for Youth and Recreation Affairs, I think it'll be important that we can follow up with that with our Director of Recreation and also move forward some discussion before the budget and making sure that

541
00:42:14,767 --> 00:42:19,449
we have all of our ducks in a row when it comes to recreation in our community.

542
00:42:19,469 --> 00:42:19,929
So thank you.

543
00:42:20,769 --> 00:42:21,069
Thank you.

544
00:42:21,349 --> 00:42:25,871
Seeing that's such a big senior sport, maybe I should, I should be looking into it.

545
00:42:25,911 --> 00:42:28,592
Maybe it'll be my new next job.

546
00:42:31,253 --> 00:42:40,637
On to motion by Councilor Bailão and Councilor Scott Felly, as amended by Councilor Scott Felly, seconded by Councilor Marks.

547
00:42:40,657 --> 00:42:41,717
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

548
00:42:45,352 --> 00:42:45,912
Councilor Bears.

549
00:42:46,412 --> 00:42:46,692
Yes.

550
00:42:47,933 --> 00:42:48,633
Councilor Falco.

551
00:42:49,013 --> 00:42:49,233
Yes.

552
00:42:49,713 --> 00:42:50,474
Vice President Nights.

553
00:42:50,494 --> 00:42:50,814
Yes.

554
00:42:51,154 --> 00:42:51,754
Councilor Marks.

555
00:42:51,774 --> 00:42:52,134
Yes.

556
00:42:52,554 --> 00:42:53,174
Councilor Morrell.

557
00:42:53,535 --> 00:42:53,755
Yes.

558
00:42:54,735 --> 00:42:55,455
Councilor Scarpelli.

559
00:42:55,495 --> 00:42:55,855
Yes.

560
00:42:55,995 --> 00:42:56,796
President Caravaglia.

561
00:42:56,856 --> 00:43:01,717
Yes, seven affirmative motion passes.

562
00:43:01,737 --> 00:43:12,901
21-076 offered by Councilor Falco and President Caravaglia being resolved that the city administration develop a pilot program to resurface a portion of our roads using recycled asphalt.

563
00:43:13,581 --> 00:43:14,381
Councilor Falco.

564
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:18,111
Thank you, Mr. President.

565
00:43:19,592 --> 00:43:30,540
So, each of us has received many, many calls I think throughout the years, each and every one of us with regard to potholes, streets that are in disrepair.

566
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:37,946
And this year is a program that President Caviello and I learned about last year at a conference.

567
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:44,491
And what it is, is it basically takes recycled asphalt, and actually they use it to pave the street again.

568
00:43:46,405 --> 00:43:55,876
There are numerous benefits to the process, shorter construction times, it's easier to use around catch basins and manholes and water valves and whatnot.

569
00:43:56,437 --> 00:43:59,280
It lowers engineering and traffic control costs as well.

570
00:44:00,281 --> 00:44:04,587
Last week we received an update from a CFO for the city of Medford.

571
00:44:06,425 --> 00:44:11,448
to say the least, the 2022 city budget is going to be a challenge.

572
00:44:12,329 --> 00:44:25,917
So this option that myself and my colleague are putting forth tonight, I think it's just a way to think out of the box to see if there's some way that we can work together to move forward and get some of our streets paved at a reasonable cost.

573
00:44:26,077 --> 00:44:34,902
The city is struggling for money and revenue, but I think this might be an option to pave our streets or at least

574
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:40,966
come up with a pilot program, even if we try doing this to a few of our streets, we should at least try.

575
00:44:40,986 --> 00:44:47,591
And so it's just a cheaper alternative to paving our streets where we currently pave them.

576
00:44:47,671 --> 00:44:52,914
So I actually have additional information for anybody that wants to see it, they can make a copy.

577
00:44:54,015 --> 00:44:57,617
But at this point, I would ask for your support and I move approval.

578
00:44:59,629 --> 00:45:00,609
Thank you, Councilor Falcone.

579
00:45:00,669 --> 00:45:03,630
I want to thank Councilor Falcone again for bringing this forward.

580
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:06,391
This is something Councilor Falcone and I brought up last year also.

581
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:19,855
And again, the benefit of using our own recycled alcohol is normally, I don't know if anybody, but normally when they mill a street, they take it to a plant and they give it to them.

582
00:45:20,295 --> 00:45:21,775
We have to buy it back from them.

583
00:45:22,316 --> 00:45:26,917
So what these companies do is they do it right on site.

584
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:35,241
So as they're milling and grinding, they're making the asphalt right behind the truck, and it's coming right back out.

585
00:45:35,281 --> 00:45:38,062
So again, it was something that we brought up last year.

586
00:45:38,442 --> 00:45:39,462
It didn't really go anywhere.

587
00:45:39,502 --> 00:45:49,304
And I would hope that the administration and Mr. Cameron's look at this again, especially when money's tight, then money for roads.

588
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:54,865
And if we can do two roads for the price of one, I say that's what we need to do.

589
00:45:56,781 --> 00:45:58,782
It's time that this be looked at.

590
00:45:58,982 --> 00:46:02,524
And again, I hope that this gets looked at again this year.

591
00:46:02,825 --> 00:46:04,926
So I thank you, Councilor Falco and myself for bringing this up.

592
00:46:05,066 --> 00:46:05,386
Thank you.

593
00:46:06,927 --> 00:46:07,687
Any further discussion?

594
00:46:07,727 --> 00:46:08,268
Is it present?

595
00:46:08,948 --> 00:46:09,528
Councilor Box.

596
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:10,989
Thank you, Mr. President.

597
00:46:11,009 --> 00:46:16,793
I want to thank my two colleagues, Councilor Falco and Councilor President Gaviello for putting this on.

598
00:46:17,493 --> 00:46:26,138
As I've stated in the past, we put very little to almost no money to resurface our roads and the budget.

599
00:46:26,758 --> 00:46:33,442
So we rely heavily on chapter 90 money, which is about 980,000 a year we receive from the state.

600
00:46:33,962 --> 00:46:49,312
And when you have over 700, 800 streets in a community, you can imagine a 980,000 doesn't go too far in having a plan to resurface our roads.

601
00:46:49,772 --> 00:46:55,515
Councilor Knight offered something back, I think it was two years ago, maybe two years now.

602
00:46:56,846 --> 00:47:12,551
regarding having our streets inspected through this machine that would go and almost do like an x-ray of the roads, up and down the roads, and be able to give you a printout on what streets are in dire need to be repaired and so forth.

603
00:47:13,311 --> 00:47:24,074
And it sounded like a magnificent idea to at least understand 700 or 800 roads, what the condition is, how they're evaluated, and what priority they're put in.

604
00:47:24,487 --> 00:47:29,350
Because right now, I think it's just a matter of, you know, the squeaky wheel gets the oil.

605
00:47:29,970 --> 00:47:36,213
And I can tell you firsthand, I've lived on the street almost 30 years that hasn't been touched in 30 years.

606
00:47:37,314 --> 00:47:49,560
So I think looking at some of these innovative and creative ways of potentially, as you mentioned, Mr. President, having our dollar spread a little further and doing more roads per year.

607
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:52,982
And as Councilor Knight mentioned a while back by

608
00:47:53,772 --> 00:47:57,395
evaluating our streets to see where the priority roads are.

609
00:47:58,015 --> 00:48:05,240
I think that goes a long way in having an approach, a systematic approach to addressing what our needs are in the community, Mr. President.

610
00:48:05,841 --> 00:48:09,123
And so I support this paper wholeheartedly.

611
00:48:09,744 --> 00:48:13,446
I'd like to see even if we can roll it out to sidewalks as well.

612
00:48:13,486 --> 00:48:17,309
I know this substance could probably be used on sidewalks as well.

613
00:48:17,949 --> 00:48:21,292
And if that's the case, it may be a cost effective way

614
00:48:22,331 --> 00:48:31,259
handling some of the trip and falls that end up being lawsuits in a quicker and much more reasonable fashion, Mr. President.

615
00:48:31,299 --> 00:48:40,868
Councilor Marks, if you can recall, Councilor Falcone and myself also brought out a program for a company to come to the city that does that.

616
00:48:41,688 --> 00:48:44,591
They go out there and set your sidewalks.

617
00:48:45,152 --> 00:48:50,054
and they tell you which ones they can easily fix by either grinding or bringing them down to level.

618
00:48:51,055 --> 00:48:54,316
So again, this is something that's been brought up to the administration before.

619
00:48:54,836 --> 00:49:01,719
And if you do a little bit of work, this company's all here to do that stuff.

620
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:07,222
So again, there's no reason why we can't be looking into it, especially during these tough financial times.

621
00:49:08,903 --> 00:49:14,185
Okay, the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Marks.

622
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,936
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

623
00:49:20,518 --> 00:49:21,098
Councilor Behrs.

624
00:49:21,559 --> 00:49:21,859
Yes.

625
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,580
Councilor Fevella.

626
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:23,940
Yes.

627
00:49:24,481 --> 00:49:25,221
Vice President Knight.

628
00:49:25,661 --> 00:49:25,941
Yes.

629
00:49:26,222 --> 00:49:26,822
Councilor Marks.

630
00:49:27,062 --> 00:49:27,422
Yes.

631
00:49:27,723 --> 00:49:28,343
Councilor Morrell.

632
00:49:28,683 --> 00:49:29,003
Yes.

633
00:49:29,804 --> 00:49:30,584
Councilor Scarpelli.

634
00:49:30,684 --> 00:49:31,025
Yes.

635
00:49:31,425 --> 00:49:32,185
President Kerrio.

636
00:49:32,406 --> 00:49:32,666
Yes.

637
00:49:32,686 --> 00:49:33,646
Assembly affirmative.

638
00:49:34,047 --> 00:49:34,887
Motion passes.

639
00:49:34,907 --> 00:49:37,849
Okay.

640
00:49:37,989 --> 00:49:39,650
Communications with the city clerk 21077.

641
00:49:43,473 --> 00:49:47,636
City of Medford 2021 municipal election calendar.

642
00:49:52,900 --> 00:50:01,946
On the motion by Councilor Knight to have a brief synopsis by the clerk, seconded by Councilor Falco.

643
00:50:02,506 --> 00:50:03,767
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

644
00:50:04,788 --> 00:50:05,368
Councilor Behrs?

645
00:50:05,789 --> 00:50:06,049
Yes.

646
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:07,850
Councilor Falco?

647
00:50:07,950 --> 00:50:08,170
Yes.

648
00:50:09,031 --> 00:50:09,732
Vice President Knight?

649
00:50:09,952 --> 00:50:10,232
Yes.

650
00:50:10,512 --> 00:50:11,093
Councilor Marks?

651
00:50:11,113 --> 00:50:11,433
Yes.

652
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:12,473
Councilor Morrell?

653
00:50:12,814 --> 00:50:13,014
Yes.

654
00:50:13,842 --> 00:50:14,583
Councilor Scarpelli?

655
00:50:15,063 --> 00:50:15,403
Yes.

656
00:50:15,924 --> 00:50:16,684
President Caravaglia?

657
00:50:17,224 --> 00:50:17,485
Yes.

658
00:50:18,225 --> 00:50:19,386
Motion passes.

659
00:50:20,627 --> 00:50:23,049
Mr. Clerk, if you'd like to give a brief synopsis.

660
00:50:23,429 --> 00:50:23,909
Absolutely.

661
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:25,170
And I will be brief.

662
00:50:26,511 --> 00:50:30,134
As you're all aware, we have a minimum of two elections a year in Medford.

663
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:34,016
The elections in the evening year are set by the state.

664
00:50:36,198 --> 00:50:41,622
The elections in the odd years are set by the city clerk with the approval of the city council.

665
00:50:42,268 --> 00:50:55,633
So this is the preliminary, this is the get the ball rolling document to get us in a position to prepare and execute our elections for September, if it is necessary, and for November.

666
00:50:56,473 --> 00:51:08,297
And this document lays out all the important dates and times for that election, starting with the nomination papers in June, going all the way through the end of year campaign finance report in January of 2022.

667
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:15,195
Paul C has his hand up.

668
00:51:15,635 --> 00:51:17,655
Paul C, name and address of the record, please.

669
00:51:19,956 --> 00:51:20,516
Mr. President.

670
00:51:21,776 --> 00:51:22,596
I'm sorry, Councilor Bassett.

671
00:51:23,156 --> 00:51:23,536
Thank you.

672
00:51:23,697 --> 00:51:25,297
Just a couple of quick questions for the clerk.

673
00:51:27,737 --> 00:51:30,638
Are there any major departures on this calendar from previous years?

674
00:51:31,818 --> 00:51:32,999
There are no major departures.

675
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:34,119
I think

676
00:51:35,581 --> 00:51:45,189
Two years ago, the petitions were available, I believe on June 11th this year, they're June 8th, but we tracked previous years when we compiled this calendar.

677
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:53,757
We also conferred with Woburn and Somerville to make sure that we're all on the same page so that there's no confusion among voters.

678
00:51:55,078 --> 00:52:00,543
Great, and do you have any expectations or information around mail-in ballots and early voting?

679
00:52:01,723 --> 00:52:05,125
We're tracking that, but as you know, that could change daily.

680
00:52:05,165 --> 00:52:06,705
That's pending the legislature right now.

681
00:52:07,686 --> 00:52:18,911
We do expect an uptick in requests for absentee ballots, but we're gonna be following closely any legislation to mandate early voting this year.

682
00:52:20,051 --> 00:52:20,351
Thank you.

683
00:52:20,371 --> 00:52:31,196
And I just raised that point because it has been a priority of this council to have an elections coordinator hired by the city to take on the additional work of, you know,

684
00:52:32,527 --> 00:52:36,348
all of the elections that the clerk's office has been running and the registrar of voters has been running.

685
00:52:36,428 --> 00:52:38,368
So thank you for keeping an eye on it.

686
00:52:38,388 --> 00:52:42,349
And I just wanted to put that election coordinator idea out there once again.

687
00:52:42,929 --> 00:52:43,409
Thank you.

688
00:52:44,029 --> 00:52:53,832
And as you mentioned, the election coordinator, she's obviously working in a temporary role right now, but she was instrumental in helping us prepare this calendar.

689
00:52:54,552 --> 00:52:56,232
Yes, a permanent position.

690
00:52:56,452 --> 00:52:56,772
Thank you.

691
00:52:58,292 --> 00:52:58,613
Thank you.

692
00:52:59,713 --> 00:53:00,733
Paul C has his hand up.

693
00:53:02,794 --> 00:53:03,824
Name and address of the record, please.

694
00:53:05,443 --> 00:53:08,065
Paul Camuso, 114 Lincoln Road, Medford Mass.

695
00:53:08,105 --> 00:53:09,525
Thanks again, Mr. President.

696
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:12,307
Just I'd like to make a quick comment on the upcoming elections.

697
00:53:13,528 --> 00:53:24,854
We all know that with COVID and the last few election cycles, there's been some movement around the VFW is no longer a polling place, as well as some other minor moves.

698
00:53:25,175 --> 00:53:29,177
The temple, excuse me, not the temple, the American Legion.

699
00:53:29,837 --> 00:53:34,060
And I think it's important that you get the message out via all the communication

700
00:53:34,901 --> 00:53:35,462
that you can.

701
00:53:36,564 --> 00:53:40,512
Some people received ballots last election that didn't put in for a mail-in ballot like myself.

702
00:53:40,913 --> 00:53:43,278
I actually brought that to the attention of the city clerk at the time.

703
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:45,161
I just think there has to be a

704
00:53:46,267 --> 00:53:56,911
very good PR push to let everybody know what's going on, just because there's so many moving parts with COVID and the secretary of state just filed a bill for mail-in voting to become permanent.

705
00:53:57,231 --> 00:54:06,254
So whatever direction it goes in, I just think the public needs to know, because not everybody picks up the Boston Globe and reads the papers and does all their research.

706
00:54:06,274 --> 00:54:10,676
So it's incumbent upon this city to do that aspect of notifications, I believe.

707
00:54:14,197 --> 00:54:14,477
Thank you.

708
00:54:16,176 --> 00:54:22,341
Okay, the motion of approval by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelli.

709
00:54:22,361 --> 00:54:23,682
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

710
00:54:26,584 --> 00:54:27,325
Councilor Behrs?

711
00:54:27,705 --> 00:54:28,005
Yes.

712
00:54:29,586 --> 00:54:30,287
Councilor Fevella?

713
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:30,727
Yes.

714
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:31,868
Vice President Knight?

715
00:54:32,088 --> 00:54:32,389
Yes.

716
00:54:32,789 --> 00:54:33,369
Councilor Marks?

717
00:54:33,449 --> 00:54:33,890
Yes.

718
00:54:34,750 --> 00:54:38,053
Councilor Morales?

719
00:54:40,155 --> 00:54:40,395
Yes.

720
00:54:40,455 --> 00:54:40,935
Councilor Pelli?

721
00:54:40,955 --> 00:54:41,075
Yes.

722
00:54:41,095 --> 00:54:42,617
Yes, let me defer to motion passes.

723
00:54:43,397 --> 00:54:45,619
Excuse me, communications from the mayor.

724
00:54:46,778 --> 00:54:49,880
21037, February 16th, 2021.

725
00:54:50,581 --> 00:54:55,724
To President Richard Caravaglia and all members of the city council, from Mayor Brianne Leguere.

726
00:54:57,185 --> 00:54:58,206
Licensing of food trucks.

727
00:54:58,246 --> 00:55:08,313
Dear President Caravaglia and members of the Memphis City Council, I respectfully request that the Memphis City Council approve the following request for a food truck at the Andrews School.

728
00:55:08,593 --> 00:55:15,598
Due to COVID-19 pandemic, considering the city's temporary policies, limiting investor gatherings, the attached application

729
00:55:16,180 --> 00:55:22,364
includes some unique considerations which have been reviewed, approved by my office, as well as the Board of Health.

730
00:55:22,825 --> 00:55:28,909
This is a request for two trucks to be stationed at the Angel School for a pickup of pre-ordered dinner items.

731
00:55:29,069 --> 00:55:31,590
No conga game will be allowed as part of this plan.

732
00:55:32,331 --> 00:55:41,097
This is a request to reschedule the PTO fundraiser that had previously been scheduled for February 10th, that had to be rescheduled.

733
00:55:41,917 --> 00:55:42,518
Memphis Streets,

734
00:55:43,008 --> 00:55:46,730
Food Truck PTO fundraiser will be March 3rd, 2021.

735
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:50,232
Time will be four to seven o'clock, four to seven.

736
00:55:50,653 --> 00:55:52,494
And the setup begins at three o'clock PM.

737
00:55:52,814 --> 00:55:55,415
And the location will be at the Andrews School.

738
00:55:55,796 --> 00:55:57,256
Thank you for your consideration.

739
00:55:57,657 --> 00:55:59,858
Respectfully submitted, Mayor Brannon-Alongo-Kerr.

740
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:04,961
Councilor, Vice President Knight.

741
00:56:05,842 --> 00:56:07,062
Mr. President, thank you very much.

742
00:56:07,102 --> 00:56:10,484
This matter has been before our body on several occasions.

743
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:22,695
We took a look at it and we had some concern as to whether or not the city council should be approving an application for a permit where the entity would be doing business on school property.

744
00:56:22,975 --> 00:56:31,560
And we asked the school committee take a look through the application report back to us, whether or not it falls within their fundraising policy criteria.

745
00:56:32,501 --> 00:56:41,667
And looking at the applicant that's before us personally, I'm not too crazy about the idea of doing business with them, but I don't wanna stand in the way of the PTO getting the fundraiser

746
00:56:42,175 --> 00:56:42,876
under their belt.

747
00:56:43,556 --> 00:56:46,059
I wouldn't necessarily call this a fundraiser, Mr. President.

748
00:56:46,119 --> 00:56:55,208
I would call it the food truck provider jacking up their prices 16% and that 16% of sales being donated back to the school.

749
00:56:55,729 --> 00:56:58,491
I don't think that that's quite in the spirit of philanthropy.

750
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:06,019
However, as I stated, I don't want to get in the way of the PTO conducting

751
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:12,814
a fundraiser or an event to bring excitement about the return to their school and to raise much-needed funds.

752
00:57:14,516 --> 00:57:19,980
So, Mr. President, my concern now lies on the fact that we have an entity coming into the community.

753
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,601
They've asked for permits in the past.

754
00:57:21,641 --> 00:57:23,062
We've denied them permitting in the past.

755
00:57:24,343 --> 00:57:30,047
They're now pursuing permitting through our PTOs in our public schools, through our children.

756
00:57:31,888 --> 00:57:36,652
My concern is that this PTO fundraiser is no more than a data mining initiative.

757
00:57:37,289 --> 00:57:45,314
where they're going to be able to get people's personal information, emails, and the like, and then use that to begin a marketing campaign in the community, Mr. President.

758
00:57:45,334 --> 00:57:52,138
So I certainly have no problem approving this paper this evening for the simple fact that it's for the kids.

759
00:57:53,539 --> 00:58:04,765
However, I would like there to be requirements that no personal information or data be retained by the applicants following the conclusion of the event.

760
00:58:04,885 --> 00:58:06,366
Once they get paid, the party's over.

761
00:58:06,968 --> 00:58:12,572
And they're not going to be taking email addresses and emailing individuals in the community saying, do you want to be an ambassador?

762
00:58:12,592 --> 00:58:15,435
Do you want to have a food truck on your street?

763
00:58:15,635 --> 00:58:18,477
Use that as a form of solicitation, Mr. President.

764
00:58:18,817 --> 00:58:24,301
You know, to jack your prices up 18% and call that philanthropy and donation, I don't quite see it.

765
00:58:25,482 --> 00:58:27,404
In my world, when you give, you give.

766
00:58:28,244 --> 00:58:29,605
Sometimes that comes right off the top.

767
00:58:29,625 --> 00:58:33,428
You know, jack your prices up and then pass off your jacked up profits.

768
00:58:34,709 --> 00:58:35,650
They call that fundraising.

769
00:58:36,620 --> 00:58:47,304
So with that being said, Mr. President, I would move that the paper be approved with the following conditions, that no personal data be utilized or retained by the applicant following the conclusion of the event.

770
00:58:48,344 --> 00:58:49,044
Thank you, Vice President.

771
00:58:49,184 --> 00:58:50,045
Councilor Scarpelli.

772
00:58:50,165 --> 00:58:52,626
I would second that, Mr. President.

773
00:58:53,466 --> 00:58:53,866
Thank you.

774
00:58:53,886 --> 00:59:02,949
I said, I too understand that that was totally against us because of the implications to our brick and mortar businesses.

775
00:59:03,009 --> 00:59:04,410
And this is why I've been against the,

776
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:27,391
the food truck initiative until we have an understanding of where and when these outside businesses are coming into our community and not paying permit fees and not paying taxes and not going through the protocol that all of our brick and mortar businesses go through to survive, and especially at this time.

777
00:59:28,952 --> 00:59:34,775
I had a great discussion with Vivian Su after the event, after the meeting last few weeks ago.

778
00:59:35,692 --> 01:00:03,245
talk to a few of the business owners in our community that they are now touching base and understanding that we have brick and mortar businesses that would love to work as a fundraiser where 10% of the proceeds that go into that restaurant for that day, all the proceeds, that 10% of all people that go in there, not just the people from that school, would go directly to

779
01:00:03,994 --> 01:00:05,595
that fundraising organization.

780
01:00:05,655 --> 01:00:08,376
I think that's the true meaning of a true fundraiser.

781
01:00:08,416 --> 01:00:17,201
So again, that again shows the support of our brick and mortar businesses and what they're willing to give even during these tough times.

782
01:00:17,761 --> 01:00:22,764
They're still reaching into their pockets and wanting to help our children and our community.

783
01:00:22,804 --> 01:00:33,390
So again, I will support this initiative tonight because I think some of our PTO members were put in a very difficult position not understanding

784
01:00:34,558 --> 01:00:37,400
what was the movement with this.

785
01:00:37,521 --> 01:00:43,546
But to me, this is just a blatant effort of an end around where they came to us.

786
01:00:44,186 --> 01:00:45,347
We did not approve it.

787
01:00:46,288 --> 01:00:56,957
The person that was speaking from Watertown was moved with talking to principal and so on and so forth.

788
01:00:57,017 --> 01:00:59,599
And then this was born.

789
01:00:59,679 --> 01:01:02,842
So in a time where you're talking about probably one of the

790
01:01:03,450 --> 01:01:27,702
neediest communities, parts of our community that have got housing projects and where a lot of our kids that have need, their classmates are walking outside and paying 16 to 18% more for a meal and can't be part of that program because of what is a blown up payment system.

791
01:01:28,543 --> 01:01:31,865
I think it's truly unjust and not a,

792
01:01:33,553 --> 01:01:43,657
not of opportunity for those kids to be involved and do it right in front of them, in front of their faces really, really bothers me, but I will support this tonight and with a lot of questions.

793
01:01:43,698 --> 01:01:44,038
Thank you.

794
01:01:44,758 --> 01:01:45,818
Thank you, Councilor Scapelli.

795
01:01:45,858 --> 01:01:53,702
We have a name and address for the record, ma'am.

796
01:01:53,842 --> 01:01:55,243
Mr. Clerk, can you unmute him?

797
01:01:59,665 --> 01:01:59,885
Yes, hi.

798
01:02:01,353 --> 01:02:06,655
Good evening, everybody, and thank you, Mr. President.

799
01:02:08,136 --> 01:02:15,479
My name is Anne Marie Eidner, and I'm the blatant person that you're accusing of doing end runs.

800
01:02:15,659 --> 01:02:22,041
I'm more than happy to withdraw our application and to stay out of Medford.

801
01:02:22,642 --> 01:02:26,703
It was never our intent to do end runs around anybody.

802
01:02:26,763 --> 01:02:28,104
Nobody is making any money.

803
01:02:28,684 --> 01:02:30,745
The food trucks are all small businesses.

804
01:02:31,333 --> 01:02:37,958
They pay a permit fee, so they do everything that's required in order to be wherever they are.

805
01:02:37,978 --> 01:02:44,382
I think that the accusations that I'm hearing tonight are extremely unfair.

806
01:02:44,923 --> 01:02:47,745
No one is making money, no one.

807
01:02:48,785 --> 01:02:52,848
And I really, I'm really sorry.

808
01:02:53,769 --> 01:02:59,173
I believe the records we have, ma'am, we have that the prices were increased

809
01:02:59,798 --> 01:02:59,938
by 16%.

810
01:03:00,599 --> 01:03:01,640
Right.

811
01:03:02,721 --> 01:03:03,802
So you're not so.

812
01:03:04,423 --> 01:03:12,651
So obviously, so the understanding of a true fundraiser is leaving those prices where you have it, and then giving back to that community.

813
01:03:12,791 --> 01:03:16,435
But that's the that comes out of the trucks that doesn't come out of me.

814
01:03:16,976 --> 01:03:18,777
That comes out of what the trucks make.

815
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:22,121
Thank you.

816
01:03:22,241 --> 01:03:22,801
I'm sorry.

817
01:03:22,862 --> 01:03:23,242
I'm sorry, man.

818
01:03:24,567 --> 01:03:24,907
continue, please.

819
01:03:25,127 --> 01:03:26,809
I apologize for interrupting.

820
01:03:26,849 --> 01:03:33,214
But that's I think from the very beginning, this council has misunderstood our intentions.

821
01:03:33,775 --> 01:03:36,657
And I really am saddened by it.

822
01:03:37,378 --> 01:03:39,359
Really, we've worked extremely hard.

823
01:03:39,539 --> 01:03:41,281
I really apologize to Vivian.

824
01:03:42,101 --> 01:03:46,125
But I withdraw our offer to do this event.

825
01:03:47,272 --> 01:03:50,617
Um, I it's not it's not necessary.

826
01:03:50,737 --> 01:03:51,899
We don't have to do it.

827
01:03:52,400 --> 01:04:02,494
We wanted to do it as a way to and again, I can't increase the prices of the trucks if the trucks are going to not be able to pay for their food and their staff.

828
01:04:03,558 --> 01:04:05,500
So we don't make any money.

829
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:09,383
We make a small booking fee and that's all we make.

830
01:04:09,483 --> 01:04:12,285
We've generated thousands of dollars for PTOs.

831
01:04:12,845 --> 01:04:18,470
It started because we asked them how they were going to fundraise this year and they said they didn't have any idea.

832
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:20,810
So that's what we tried to do.

833
01:04:21,271 --> 01:04:23,931
If it doesn't work in Medford, we completely respect that.

834
01:04:24,371 --> 01:04:27,972
We apologize if we were not clear from the very beginning.

835
01:04:29,052 --> 01:04:37,034
We most of all apologize to the Andrews Middle School, but we don't think we should proceed with our request in the city of Medford.

836
01:04:38,475 --> 01:04:44,056
But ma'am, the paper has been written into the record and it cannot be withdrawn without a vote.

837
01:04:44,576 --> 01:04:46,016
So I just wanna let you know that.

838
01:04:46,657 --> 01:04:48,057
Okay, thank you.

839
01:04:50,781 --> 01:04:53,964
The mayor.

840
01:04:54,845 --> 01:04:55,606
Only the making good.

841
01:04:56,147 --> 01:04:58,329
I'm Vivian so would you like to speak.

842
01:04:59,670 --> 01:05:02,693
Vivian so please name and address of the record please.

843
01:05:03,220 --> 01:05:15,089
The ensue 93rd Street Medford mass president Thank you so much for having us here again I really appreciate hearing from Councilor night and Councilor Scott Scarpelli.

844
01:05:15,829 --> 01:05:25,417
I appreciate very much the time that you took after our last meeting, Mr Scarpelli to chat with me and to share your concerns.

845
01:05:26,317 --> 01:05:47,246
more deeply and to help me understand, better understand, I would very much enjoy having a further meeting to talk about the brick and mortar stores that are interested in hosting fundraisers at this time with us, because surely, once again, we realize that the PTOs are at a disadvantage due to COVID and this pandemic.

846
01:05:47,306 --> 01:05:51,889
So we are scratching our heads, trying to come up with creative ways.

847
01:05:54,270 --> 01:05:54,810
You know, we,

848
01:05:55,827 --> 01:06:04,472
We thought that a food truck fundraiser sounded like a good idea, something new, something innovative, something that we could do.

849
01:06:05,873 --> 01:06:09,375
But I understand all of the concerns.

850
01:06:09,895 --> 01:06:18,720
I was not there from the very beginning of the discussions that started months ago, so kind of jumping in in midstream.

851
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:24,523
But I appreciate hearing all sides, and I leave it at that.

852
01:06:26,517 --> 01:06:26,857
Thank you.

853
01:06:27,377 --> 01:06:28,197
Any further discussion?

854
01:06:29,258 --> 01:06:29,478
Okay.

Committee of hold will report the following.

875
01:07:14,678 --> 01:07:20,203
21-065 was the Q2 update done by a finance director Alicia Dudley.

876
01:07:20,724 --> 01:07:22,125
And she painted a picture

877
01:07:22,847 --> 01:07:27,088
of where we'll be going for the foreseeable future.

878
01:07:27,848 --> 01:07:37,331
And there's a little on the grim side, but hopefully we'll rebound and make some kind of comeback.

879
01:07:37,391 --> 01:07:45,693

01:10:14,484 --> 01:10:15,286
Councilor Scarpelli.

1049
01:10:15,467 --> 01:10:15,787

1050
01:10:16,028 --> 01:10:16,749
President Kerrio.

1051
01:10:16,870 --> 01:10:17,130
Yes.

1052
01:10:17,451 --> 01:10:20,338
Mr. President before you adjourn.

1053
01:10:21,970 --> 01:10:26,093
I want to wish a very special person a happy 29th birthday.

1054
01:10:26,954 --> 01:10:30,436
Carol Carviello, I believe, celebrated her 29th birthday.

1055
01:10:30,476 --> 01:10:39,183
We want to make sure that, you know, anybody that's been married to you as long as she's been alive has been pretty impressive.

1056
01:10:39,203 --> 01:10:40,184
So thank you.

1057
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:43,626
I'm a little disheartened you guys forgot my birthday last week.

1058
01:10:44,207 --> 01:10:45,548
Happy birthday, Carol.

1059
01:10:48,648 --> 01:10:51,250
I'll have the motion, but any other discussion?

1060
01:10:51,770 --> 01:10:53,852
I'll have the motion by Councilor Scott Kelly.

1061
01:10:54,192 --> 01:10:56,313
So Councilor Marks, do you want to say something?

1062
01:10:56,594 --> 01:10:57,554
I do, Mr. President.

1063
01:10:58,155 --> 01:11:09,524
Several weeks back, we had the Board of Health Director before us, and I believe it was Councilor Scott Kelly asked the Board of Health Director when we could start having the general public into the meeting.

1064
01:11:10,264 --> 01:11:17,690
And the Board of Health Director stated that as long as there's social distancing and all the CDC rules and regulations

1065
01:11:18,052 --> 01:11:22,775
or adhere to, we're fine to have members of the general public come up to our meeting.

1066
01:11:23,696 --> 01:11:33,982
Since then, we've had at least two that I can recall, maybe three people come before the council in person to publicly state their opinions on issues.

1067
01:11:34,703 --> 01:11:44,349
And Mr. President, I am dumbfounded why the building is still on lockdown while we have our meeting at seven o'clock here at City Hall.

1068
01:11:44,850 --> 01:11:46,951
So I would ask Mr. President respectfully

1069
01:11:47,381 --> 01:11:55,283
that these doors remain open during this council meeting, whereas we were given the green light by the Board of Health Director.

1070
01:11:55,783 --> 01:12:06,786
Of course, unless things have changed and we weren't notified, but then again, we wouldn't know that because the Board of Health Director hasn't appeared before this council at our request.

1071
01:12:07,286 --> 01:12:15,668
So I would ask Mr. President that these doors remain open for public input during the council meeting, Mr. President.

1072
01:12:16,765 --> 01:12:22,068
And as I mentioned, as long as social distancing and all the CDC requirements are adhered to.

1073
01:12:22,448 --> 01:12:27,970
And I will reach out to the chief of staff and the mayor tomorrow to address that subject.

1074
01:12:28,310 --> 01:12:37,915
On another matter, something we talked about last week and we had a member of the public here on the collection boxes at Wellington Circle.

1075
01:12:39,055 --> 01:12:45,358
I had the opportunity to go by on Thursday and the collection bins were overflowing.

1076
01:12:45,701 --> 01:12:46,821
And there was stuff on the sides.

1077
01:12:46,941 --> 01:12:55,063
And after doing a little bit of work, I was able to reach out to somebody from Standard Recycling to address the problem.

1078
01:12:55,663 --> 01:13:00,205
And when I spoke to the gentleman, told him that the things were full.

1079
01:13:00,765 --> 01:13:06,566
And he told me that he was unaware that we had a collection ordinance.

1080
01:13:06,886 --> 01:13:09,607
He has spoken with the building commissioner, Moki.

1081
01:13:10,107 --> 01:13:14,268
And on Saturday, he told us where he said, I'll have a truck out there on Saturday.

1082
01:13:14,740 --> 01:13:17,381
did have a truck out there on Saturday to empty the bins.

1083
01:13:17,781 --> 01:13:30,484
And he told me that he will be having a truck there this week to take the collection bins out of there until he conforms to the new ordinance.

1084
01:13:30,964 --> 01:13:39,586
And on another note, he also stated that he signed the lease with Kimco to rent that spot.

1085
01:13:39,646 --> 01:13:42,947
And I explained to him that he should maybe

1086
01:13:43,528 --> 01:13:50,492
Wait till he goes a little further to see where the council wants to go with that collection box.

1087
01:13:50,872 --> 01:13:52,152
So just a little update.

1088
01:13:52,773 --> 01:14:00,396
So I know Mr. Paul, he was here last week and since then it was full and I'm glad the gentleman came, he was very responsive, came right down and cleaned it up.

1089
01:14:00,617 --> 01:14:01,777
So I wanted to just say that.

1090
01:14:02,858 --> 01:14:07,300
So on the motion we adjourn by Councilor Falco, seconded by Councilor Marks.

1091
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:09,281
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1092
01:14:13,816 --> 01:14:14,357

1093
01:14:14,837 --> 01:14:15,117

1094

Councilor Fevella.

1095
01:14:17,860 --> 01:14:18,120
Yes.

1096
01:14:18,541 --> 01:14:19,261
Vice President Knight.

1097
01:14:19,762 --> 01:14:20,162
Yes.

1098
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:21,003
Councilor Marks.

1099
01:14:21,383 --> 01:14:21,804
Yes.

1100
01:14:22,064 --> 01:14:22,725
Councilor Morrell.

1101
01:14:23,105 --> 01:14:23,405
Yes.

1102
01:14:24,246 --> 01:14:25,047
Councilor Scarpelli.

1103
01:14:25,267 --> 01:14:25,548
Yes.

1104
01:14:25,728 --> 01:14:26,549
President Kerrio.

1105
01:14:26,769 --> 01:14:27,009
Yes.

1106
01:14:27,149 --> 01:14:28,571
I have a good evening.

1107
01:14:29,091 --> 01:14:30,292
We'll see everybody tomorrow night.
