1
00:00:00,131 --> 00:00:08,733
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone, thanks for tuning in to Solidarity Live, where we take questions and stories from the community in Somerville and Medford.

2
00:00:09,093 --> 00:00:12,954
[SPEAKER_01]: We bring in experts to talk about those issues, and then we work to solve those together.

3
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:17,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, I have on someone from the Welcome Project.

4
00:00:17,815 --> 00:00:25,657
[SPEAKER_01]: She's going to talk all about everything they do with our immigrant community and a specific fund that she's working with today.

5
00:00:25,677 --> 00:00:27,317
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to bring her right in.

6
00:00:27,337 --> 00:00:27,657
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is

7
00:00:29,898 --> 00:00:31,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me have her join us.

8
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:40,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, this is Kenya Alfaro of The Welcome Project.

9
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:42,424
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Kenya, you're live.

10
00:00:42,444 --> 00:00:44,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

11
00:00:44,105 --> 00:00:45,605
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, how are you?

12
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:49,727
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing well, as well as I guess you can be right now.

13
00:00:49,927 --> 00:00:50,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.

14
00:00:52,490 --> 00:01:03,334
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love for you to just tell us a little bit about what the Welcome Project does in general, and then specifically how you're dealing with COVID.

15
00:01:04,775 --> 00:01:05,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

16
00:01:05,175 --> 00:01:07,196
[SPEAKER_00]: So my name is Kenya Alfaro.

17
00:01:07,356 --> 00:01:10,017
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the Director of Parental Engagement at the Welcome Project.

18
00:01:10,644 --> 00:01:17,067
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're an immigrant nonprofit based in the city of Somerville, but we work with immigrants throughout the whole greater Boston region.

19
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:28,852
[SPEAKER_00]: And our mission is to build the collective power of immigrants so that they can participate in community decisions, whatever that might look like, whether it be cities or schools or their own neighborhoods.

20
00:01:29,552 --> 00:01:36,578
[SPEAKER_00]: And so usually what we would have kind of going on throughout the school year is an array of different programs.

21
00:01:36,618 --> 00:01:44,305
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our largest program is our adult ESOL program and we serve over 200 adult immigrants in those classes.

22
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:51,191
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an interpretation program for bilingual high school youth in both Medford and Somerville high school.

23
00:01:52,917 --> 00:02:03,604
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of different other youth programming that focus on K-8 students, whether it be cultural identity, and just kind of exploring what it means for them to be bicultural.

24
00:02:04,825 --> 00:02:11,729
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we act upon a lot of different organizing movements as well, like the Driver's License Campaign here in Massachusetts.

25
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:18,333
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a rapid response network serving to, you know, inform community members of any ICE activity as well.

26
00:02:18,693 --> 00:02:20,935
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just kind of like a quick snapshot of

27
00:02:21,278 --> 00:02:22,919
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, usually what we have going on.

28
00:02:23,359 --> 00:02:23,739
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

29
00:02:24,019 --> 00:02:33,363
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I will mention, I just got a comment from someone saying that there's a little bit of an echo, so I don't know if anybody's not muted or because we have people later in the show who are on right now.

30
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:36,332
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you can mute, that would be great.

31
00:02:36,412 --> 00:02:38,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully this problem will resolve.

32
00:02:40,575 --> 00:02:40,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

33
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:50,342
[SPEAKER_01]: So it sounds like you guys really have good insight into our immigrant population and how they're doing.

34
00:02:51,403 --> 00:03:01,050
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would love to hear as much as you can how our immigrant community is doing now during COVID.

35
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:20,268
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, yeah, so I think we've taken the past, I don't know how many days we've been in this situation, just to kind of assess some needs and figure out, you know, a lot of the first initial things we're finding out how our families that we were working with were doing.

36
00:03:21,228 --> 00:03:26,532
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it became, well, how are the rest of our immigrant families doing throughout these cities?

37
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:36,219
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, through the Welcome Project, we were hearing a lot of stories of folks losing their jobs, of folks kind of being getting worried about paying rent.

38
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,102
[SPEAKER_00]: Food access was becoming a really, really large issue.

39
00:03:40,843 --> 00:03:43,805
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, the city of Somerville, you know,

40
00:03:44,185 --> 00:03:48,649
[SPEAKER_00]: I think really stepped in and did a lot of things to provide some of those food resources.

41
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:54,433
[SPEAKER_01]: You're saying food resources are a problem because of just lack of funds, is that right?

42
00:03:54,593 --> 00:04:03,280
[SPEAKER_00]: It's lack of funds, but also, you know, at a certain point you also did have to, like really fast, you had to have a mask to go inside a grocery store and lots of people didn't have

43
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,124
[SPEAKER_00]: So they felt intimidated to go into grocery stores to go and get the supplies of food.

44
00:04:08,144 --> 00:04:15,250
[SPEAKER_00]: And so funding and kind of that fear of like going, what if people are going to judge me if I don't have the proper attire to go inside?

45
00:04:16,712 --> 00:04:26,841
[SPEAKER_00]: So those kind of were coming about just in the people that we were talking about, people that we were talking to, and that spurred us to, we had,

46
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,503
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it seems like you've frozen.

47
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:44,833
[SPEAKER_01]: So give me one second, everyone.

48
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:48,437
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like we had a little problem with Skype.

49
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:51,761
[SPEAKER_01]: Hang on.

50
00:05:22,544 --> 00:05:26,946
[SPEAKER_01]: We are just trying to get Kenya Alfaro back on from the Welcome Project.

51
00:05:35,131 --> 00:05:48,487
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go ahead and do what I can.

52
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:55,681
[SPEAKER_01]: to get Kenya back on, to get our folks from Tufts Mutual Aid back on.

53
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,463
[SPEAKER_01]: They are also, ah, great.

54
00:05:59,663 --> 00:06:03,044
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like, ah, we have everyone back, amazing.

55
00:06:03,684 --> 00:06:10,407
[SPEAKER_01]: So sorry about that, I do not know exactly what happened, but I lost all of you and my whole Skype went down.

56
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:13,548
[SPEAKER_01]: So I apologize, thanks everyone for sticking with us.

57
00:06:14,648 --> 00:06:15,449
[SPEAKER_01]: So Kenya.

58
00:06:17,091 --> 00:06:24,962
[SPEAKER_01]: You were talking about food resources and how the city of Somerville has really done some work there to make food resources available to people.

59
00:06:26,667 --> 00:06:27,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they did.

60
00:06:27,768 --> 00:06:32,070
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, the public schools, we were hearing a lot of families kind of going into the public schools.

61
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,733
[SPEAKER_00]: They did an amazing job at providing breakfast and lunch for a lot of families.

62
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:41,456
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the food pantries like started up and running and trying to really get some food out to families.

63
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:45,839
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was, I think we've heard that be an issue.

64
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:56,045
[SPEAKER_00]: And the calls I've been making maybe the past two weeks as well, I've been hearing a lot of people who are still worried about food in other cities, not in Somerville, but in other cities as well.

65
00:06:56,808 --> 00:06:57,809
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, yeah.

66
00:06:58,389 --> 00:07:10,596
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you know if folks in that community have been plugging into the Mutual Aid, so the Medford and Somerville Mutual Aid, or in any of the other cities' Mutual Aid projects?

67
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:13,800
[SPEAKER_00]: A few of them had.

68
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:19,961
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot who had not heard of mutual aids, nor did they understand the concept of a mutual aid, right?

69
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:24,143
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also, you know, like was learning about, okay, what does this mean?

70
00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:25,003
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it look like?

71
00:07:25,503 --> 00:07:31,945
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think the past two weeks that we've been, I've been making a lot more phone calls.

72
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:36,026
[SPEAKER_00]: My next question is, oh, did you know that you can also get food from other places?

73
00:07:36,146 --> 00:07:38,367
[SPEAKER_00]: And have you contacted mamas?

74
00:07:38,407 --> 00:07:39,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you contacted like,

75
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:48,489
[SPEAKER_00]: the Cambridge or Habitat, other mutual aid networks, to get them plugged into different resources so that they know that they're out there.

76
00:07:48,509 --> 00:08:00,091
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it comes, people are very surprised, at least the families that I work with, they're very surprised that someone's just gonna go deliver groceries to their front doorstep, but they're really, really appreciative of that as well.

77
00:08:00,811 --> 00:08:02,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, yeah.

78
00:08:02,432 --> 00:08:06,052
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have a particular fund that you administer, is that right?

79
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:07,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you wanna talk a little bit about that?

80
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:08,873
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.

81
00:08:10,647 --> 00:08:16,138
[SPEAKER_00]: The Immigrant Assistance Fund that we have running through the Whatcom Project right now, it is

82
00:08:17,926 --> 00:08:20,828
[SPEAKER_00]: We started, we had a donor who really wanted to help out.

83
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:25,511
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew that there were a lot of economic hardships and we knew that we wanted to help out.

84
00:08:25,571 --> 00:08:27,632
[SPEAKER_00]: We just didn't, we weren't sure how to do it.

85
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:33,896
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, there was the first step and more people wanted to see how they could help us and how they could donate and how they can help families.

86
00:08:33,976 --> 00:08:41,101
[SPEAKER_00]: And it quickly became something very, I guess, easy that we said we needed to do something, even if it's,

87
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:43,622
[SPEAKER_00]: providing a little bit of financial support.

88
00:08:44,163 --> 00:08:51,347
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this fund is open to immigrant families in Somerville, Medford, Cambridge, Everett, and Malden.

89
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:56,151
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically those areas, we know that Somerville does have some support services, but

90
00:08:57,131 --> 00:09:08,236
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of students who come from those different cities, and we really wanted to make sure that if our students are coming from those, that means that there are other families who are also in those cities who might also be needing some resources.

91
00:09:09,336 --> 00:09:15,559
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we really wanted to be the outreach where in some cities there might not be as much support as maybe Somerville has.

92
00:09:15,599 --> 00:09:19,581
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanted to make sure that at least families could have a little bit of something through us.

93
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:24,705
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, it's a very simple, I guess, quick application.

94
00:09:24,785 --> 00:09:27,367
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a name and a phone number with language preference.

95
00:09:27,447 --> 00:09:29,409
[SPEAKER_00]: And we give folks a call back.

96
00:09:29,489 --> 00:09:30,790
[SPEAKER_00]: We ask a few questions.

97
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:33,612
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, we kind of see how we can support them.

98
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:44,541
[SPEAKER_00]: As we tell a lot of the families, it's not a lot of money that we are able to support them, but it helps with a little bit that they might be having and then connecting them through different resources throughout.

99
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:49,785
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think, you know, a lot of the fund and the phone calls, you know, the communication with families is,

100
00:09:50,265 --> 00:09:59,950
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, we're providing them some financial support that they might need, but also it's about connecting them to different community resources that they might not be aware are there.

101
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:01,891
[SPEAKER_00]: And that just might be for many different reasons.

102
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:05,513
[SPEAKER_00]: It just may be communication, it be like language barriers or whatever it might be.

103
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:16,359
[SPEAKER_00]: So this fund is just there to give a little, to just give a little, a partial little cushion for any expenses that they see for themselves and for their families, really.

104
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:16,459
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

105
00:10:18,077 --> 00:10:24,640
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just remind people that if you have any questions, you can just put those in the comment box and we can pull those right in.

106
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:31,784
[SPEAKER_01]: In your outreach, you guys must have a lot of languages on hand, I imagine.

107
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:38,427
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're calling through people, how many different languages do you have to rely on to reach out to people?

108
00:10:39,668 --> 00:10:40,168
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

109
00:10:40,488 --> 00:10:45,691
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a native Spanish speaker, so I do basically all of the Spanish intakes.

110
00:10:46,747 --> 00:10:50,050
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second language, the highest need that we had was Portuguese.

111
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:57,896
[SPEAKER_00]: And we, because we have an interpreters program within our organization, our interpreters have been able to help out in Portuguese.

112
00:10:58,857 --> 00:11:02,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Spanish and Portuguese have been the highest needs right now.

113
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:09,225
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some for Creole, which as well, we also have some interpreters and some other volunteers who were able to help.

114
00:11:10,206 --> 00:11:14,069
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have some families that we work with who are higher, like English,

115
00:11:15,931 --> 00:11:18,473
[SPEAKER_00]: confident and so they have also been helping us.

116
00:11:18,494 --> 00:11:22,498
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been able to stipend them and they've been helping us as well with some of these calls.

117
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:27,851
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really thanks to the interpreters.

118
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:34,396
[SPEAKER_00]: I've rediscovered three-way calls again, which I had to Google how to do a three-way call.

119
00:11:35,216 --> 00:11:52,269
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even though like our staff internally who are making the phone calls might not have all of those languages, we do have, you know, our mission within the Welcome Project, because it supports all of these programs, allows us then to have that language capacity to be able to reach out to as many families as we have.

120
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, that is great.

121
00:11:54,132 --> 00:11:55,934
[SPEAKER_01]: And are there ways that people can help?

122
00:11:56,054 --> 00:11:58,697
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it sounds like people can donate to that fund specifically.

123
00:11:58,717 --> 00:12:05,646
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fund, I assume, is directly related to COVID, and it started with COVID, and so it really has to do with that.

124
00:12:05,786 --> 00:12:08,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there other ways in addition to that that people can help?

125
00:12:10,738 --> 00:12:16,182
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as of right now, the donating to the fund is really, really amazing for us.

126
00:12:16,642 --> 00:12:22,066
[SPEAKER_00]: We're always looking for, in-house we don't have folks who can help us maybe with like graphics.

127
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:33,575
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anyone is like volunteering for graphics or for media or photography or whatever it is, we're always kind of looking for ways for folks to help us create something that could give us a bigger outreach as well.

128
00:12:34,095 --> 00:12:43,937
[SPEAKER_00]: So volunteering, there are a lot of skill sets that we wish we could have at the Wellcome Project, and sometimes it just takes that one reaching out to us and saying, hey, I have this skill set.

129
00:12:44,277 --> 00:12:45,417
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any need?

130
00:12:45,577 --> 00:12:46,597
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you like any of this?

131
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:47,997
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually we do.

132
00:12:48,197 --> 00:12:49,738
[SPEAKER_00]: We need some support in that.

133
00:12:49,798 --> 00:12:51,818
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's another way as well.

134
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:55,439
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but like you said, this fund really came out because of COVID.

135
00:12:56,499 --> 00:13:02,960
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to make sure that we are able to just keep sustaining this fund as much as possible.

136
00:13:03,660 --> 00:13:09,064
[SPEAKER_00]: then I would say about donating to this fund is also a huge, huge, huge way to help us.

137
00:13:09,745 --> 00:13:16,510
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, any other idea that you have, you know, we have people approach us of, do you need art supplies for families?

138
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:26,478
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, yeah, we'll take some, we'll deliver them, you know, we'll kind of do like anything that's out of the box and creative, we will probably find a way that we can kind of use these volunteer opportunities.

139
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:27,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, good.

140
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:30,481
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like at one point there was a need for masks.

141
00:13:30,622 --> 00:13:30,862
[SPEAKER_01]: I know

142
00:13:31,623 --> 00:13:36,588
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a lot of folks and mamas are excited to make masks, so I don't know if that's something that people still need.

143
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:44,115
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, with this whole new rule in Somerville, we're kind of really trying to assess what that means.

144
00:13:46,037 --> 00:13:55,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's be clear, there's a new law in Somerville saying that when out of your house, you must wear a mask, and there is a fine, up to $300, I think, fine related to that.

145
00:13:55,827 --> 00:14:14,849
[SPEAKER_00]: Right and so we're you know we're trying to kind of assess what that looks like and if people are even hearing that news because a lot of this news does go out through any communication like city communication and a lot of our families aren't actually subscribed to that nor do they feel comfortable subscribing to those email communications or even phone call communications.

146
00:14:14,869 --> 00:14:15,670
[SPEAKER_00]: So

147
00:14:17,811 --> 00:14:39,020
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been asking whenever people tell me like oh I haven't been going to the groceries I try to ask them is it because what is it like do you need a mask and I've had a few people who have said yeah I would like a face covering and I would like a mask but we're not entirely sure how we would even get them those to them quite yet so we are trying to brainstorm and really rethink what this

148
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:47,343
[SPEAKER_00]: what this order, what this law means for our families and the impact that it's going to have on them and also accessing other different resources, basic, basic resources.

149
00:14:48,243 --> 00:14:49,364
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might be a need.

150
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:55,106
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, there's some things that we don't even think about on the spot that someone could email us and say, hey, did you think about this?

151
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,326
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you know if you need this?

152
00:14:56,406 --> 00:14:58,327
[SPEAKER_00]: And we might actually need it.

153
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:00,388
[SPEAKER_00]: We just haven't actually thought about it in the moment.

154
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:10,366
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, do you wanna give just a little plug for like how people can find you, how people can donate to the fund or help out in other ways?

155
00:15:10,746 --> 00:15:12,388
[SPEAKER_01]: Like specifically, like what's the website and?

156
00:15:13,108 --> 00:15:13,729
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.

157
00:15:14,209 --> 00:15:17,752
[SPEAKER_00]: So folks can visit our website, it's welcomeproject.org.

158
00:15:18,793 --> 00:15:22,676
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can find information about us and other programs that we have as well.

159
00:15:23,476 --> 00:15:27,099
[SPEAKER_00]: We are thinking about potentially doing things virtually this summer.

160
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:31,863
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things that we're always looking for are ESOL teachers or folks to help us with our like

161
00:15:33,044 --> 00:15:40,028
[SPEAKER_00]: our camp or after school programming, that website will kind of give you more of a better overview, I think, of what we do.

162
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:54,797
[SPEAKER_00]: If you would like to donate, there's also a little blue button on the top right corner as well that you can donate, or you can also find out a bit more information about our fund right there as well, or any other resources regarding COVID in multiple cities as well.

163
00:15:55,641 --> 00:15:55,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

164
00:15:56,101 --> 00:15:56,862
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

165
00:15:56,962 --> 00:15:58,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Great work that you guys are doing.

166
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:02,587
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful to have you on and keep us updated.

167
00:16:02,627 --> 00:16:07,651
[SPEAKER_01]: Let us know as things change, if there are more needs and other ways that people can help.

168
00:16:08,512 --> 00:16:08,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

169
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:10,834
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having me.

170
00:16:10,854 --> 00:16:11,034
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

171
00:16:11,094 --> 00:16:11,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Great to have you.
