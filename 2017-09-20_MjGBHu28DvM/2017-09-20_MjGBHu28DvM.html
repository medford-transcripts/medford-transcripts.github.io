    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2388.348s">Anita</a>  Flater, 5 High Street, United of Massachusetts, 02155.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2391.389s">And</a>  you were the owner, correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2394.19s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2394.99s">I'm</a>  the managing director of Ultimate Tango. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2399.115s">We</a>  want to speak in favor of that and we basically want to express or explain the reasons why we need these extra hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2406.757s">So</a>  Argentine tango is not simply just a dance, it's the whole culture that basically teaches people how to behave in public places when there is a dance involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2419.4s">and</a>  also involves different customs and habits of the cultural behavior between lady and the gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2428.004s">So</a>  we have this, besides just teaching simply the tango during our regular classes, we also have these gatherings that are called milonga, where people come and practice their dance, but also meet socially. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2442.551s">So</a>  those gatherings in Boston area are happening every day in different studios. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2449.995s">And</a>  right now the only day that is not occupied is Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2453.897s">So</a>  our starting day where we would like to use this additional two hours of business being open would be Sunday to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2465.844s">We</a>  will not initially use any other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2469.446s">So</a>  it will be once a week on Sunday when people will come at 9 o'clock for the special event and stay until 1 o'clock to dance. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2479.654s">Those</a>  milongas have special settings. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2481.836s">It's</a>  the gathering when people can sit, talk between each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2487.019s">They</a>  usually come as a couple, husband and wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2490.622s">people</a>  who are together, or sometimes come the whole families and they sit together. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2494.425s">There</a>  is a special code of dress, there is a special code of invitation, how to invite lady for dance. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2500.449s">There</a>  is a special code how many dances they dance together. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2503.431s">There</a>  is a lot of different little customs that people who dance tango, they know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2508.695s">And</a>  of course, some of you participated in our opening night, so you're kind of familiar how it looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2515.811s">So</a>  there is no kind of like a wild party settings. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2520.935s">The</a>  music is very mild. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2522.597s">People</a>  behave actually very, very politely. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2524.999s">They</a>  care for the ladies, they care for the partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2527.821s">They</a>  walk them in, they walk them to the car, so it's very safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2530.803s">I</a>  explained all that to Mr. Sacco, the chief of police, who had a little doubt and he seemed to be understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2539.77s">how</a>  it looks like, and we also invited him over, so that's why he now supports our application too. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2546.695s">And</a>  that's pretty much it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2549.437s">Yeah,</a>  this is very much, I mean, one of the reasons also we have the event start by 9pm, because as we say, there are quite a lot of events happening during the week, you know, so this Sunday, there are another two studios who organized <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2564.355s">two</a>  more practicals in different hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2566.336s">If</a>  we don't want to conflict, you know, the business, we want to respect the hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2570.777s">The</a>  only hour we can start it will be like at 9 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2574.138s">And</a>  because we finish also our lessons around 6 p.m., some people coming from New York and from different areas far away, and they want to just go home, maybe with the family, you know, take a shower, get ready for coming back to the party. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2587.081s">Before</a>  they coming back, sometimes, you know, driving 45 minutes, some people driving one hour, and be in the studio just for <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2593.85s">And</a>  also in Argentina the milonga is 24 hours, so people just keep dancing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2598.612s">It's</a>  a kind of ritual. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2600.013s">In</a>  Argentina we dance very much all day long, from 10 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2602.574s">to</a>  6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2602.834s">sometimes,</a>  longer.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2626.355s">We</a>  also believe we will not interfere with anybody because it's a business area and also our music is really mild, like nobody even hear it outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2637.644s">And</a>  since most people drive and there's plenty of parking here and it's a business district, most businesses are already closed, only two restaurants open till 11, then I don't think we're gonna collide with anybody specifically.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2653.738s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2656.024s">Come</a>  through the gate.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2658.427s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2661.109s">I've</a>  reviewed the paperwork and the paperwork appears to be in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2665.092s">I've</a>  noticed a couple of concessions that the applicant has made. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2668.314s">Initially,</a>  the request was to stay open till 4 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2671.837s">Sunday</a>  evenings. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2673.338s">Chief</a>  Sacco wasn't too fond of that idea and has approved a restriction of operation till 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2679.842s">That's</a>  something that he feels as though he's comfortable with. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2682.765s">Also,</a>  I've noticed that the petitioner has agreed to have the doors locked at 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2687.828s">And</a>  no one will be allowed to enter the facility unless they're buzzed in through an intercom system that they have there, which also has a camera capability so that they'll know who's outside the door so that random people won't be wandering in off the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2700.306s">I</a>  do have a question for the petitioners. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2702.008s">Is</a>  there going to be any live music?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2708.087s">No,</a>  there is only going to be recorded music.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2712.171s">Mr.</a>  President, the paperwork is in order and everything appears to be signed off on by other heads in the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2718.717s">So</a>  with that being said, I see no reason in the way of this approval.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2722.861s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2724.262s">I</a>  think my first question you answered the sound will be mild, so you won't be able to have sound barriers around your facility.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2736.639s">Yeah,</a>  the sound of the rectangular is very mild music. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2739.482s">It</a>  doesn't get out. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2741.524s">Even</a>  the restaurant actors or us, we did a check sound with them, and they don't hear nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2747.709s">If</a>  we try to put on the maximum that we could use in it, and it doesn't get out.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2761.318s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2761.778s">And</a>  my second question, if you are going to be open until one and people will be dancing since nine, what are you doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2768.862s">What</a>  will there be for food and beverage?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2775.402s">During</a>  regular milongas we do not provide any food or beverage, just drinking water. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2782.646s">So</a>  no, sometimes, like we had an opening night, we did have a little snack to cheer people up, but normally no, there is no food provided by us, just drinking water.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2794.476s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2810.666s">Economic</a>  Development Committee, which takes care of signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2814.688s">We've</a>  worked in several subcommittee meetings with the proprietors of this group quite intimately over the past few months, and I have to say that they've been the most congenial people. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2830.256s">They've</a>  been compliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2832.297s">to</a>  any of our requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2834.139s">They've</a>  certainly made the effort to, and they have, attended all the meetings when we've scheduled them, which, as we all know, can be cumbersome for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2843.667s">And</a>  so if they're traveling from other towns to come in, they've been great people and <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2851.225s">As</a>  a fellow business person here in Medford, I'm delighted to have them operating in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2860.31s">They'll</a>  bring something new and diverse to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2863.412s">It's</a>  something positive and energetic. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2865.914s">And</a>  so I welcome this request and lend my voice of approval to it, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[I5lIrWN8Vh8_SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2877.947s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2878.987s">Once</a>  again, Dominic Camara, Chamber of Commerce, Governmental Affairs Committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2883.29s">And</a>  I'd like to say that I was fortunate enough with several other people to have visited the Tango Studio when they first opened it up about roughly a month ago, when they inaugurated and sort of cut the ribbons symbolically, if nothing else. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2897.136s">And</a>  I was very, very enthralled. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2898.997s">I</a>  was very happy to see the operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2901.218s">It's</a>  beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2901.938s">It's</a>  downstairs at 5 High Street, for those of you who may not realize where the <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2906.201s">position</a>  of the place and that's where the old channel three thing used to be and it's very very nice very professional and so on and I gotta tell you with all the tango that was playing and so on and these two can dance oh my god <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2923.819s">And</a>  so when we left, myself and the other two or three guests that we went to visit that night, by the time I got up to the lobby, you couldn't hear a note of the music because it's downstairs, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2933.764s">So</a>  even if it's loud and whatever it is, you're never going to hear anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2937.345s">So</a>  disturbance is not an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2938.566s">But</a>  here's the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2941.227s">that</a>  you can bring to Medford Square is a desirable thing to have and to wish for. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2946.491s">So</a>  I hope that another store like this opens up and wants to be open until 2 o'clock, let alone 1, you know, when the time comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2952.375s">And</a>  that's pretty much what I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2954.116s">And</a>  I welcome them in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2956.098s">I</a>  think they're wonderful, professional people, and they're so talented. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2959.1s">And</a>  I have nothing but happiness for them.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2961.622s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2962.602s">And</a>  I for one can say I was there that night that they opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2965.184s">I</a>  was very impressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2966.506s">The</a>  men were dressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2967.226s">The</a>  women were dressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2968.607s">The</a>  dancing was outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2970.209s">And</a>  like Mr. Kamara said, when I went down to the bottom floor there, I could barely hear the music in the hallway. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2977.975s">But</a>  again, she's promised that she can teach me how to tango. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2980.697s">Anybody</a>  can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2983.298s">But</a>  again, I welcome them. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2985.42s">And</a>  I think the studio was very, very nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2988.682s">And</a>  it's very impressive what I saw that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2990.523s">If</a>  they weren't dressed, we'd be in trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2992.044s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2992.584s">We</a>  wouldn't give up hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2994.926s">Move</a>  approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2999.528s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor De La Russa. <a

href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3010.034s">I'll</a>  be down for those dance lessons. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3020.266s">Okay.</a>  <a

Ashland Street will require grinding and inlaying the trench from centerline to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3133.469s">The</a>  trench paving of Salem Street will be asphalt-based

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3270.107s">Okay,</a>  could you please explain your project there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3272.92s">In</a>  this project, we have a request from the Century Bank to provide service. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3276.502s">We're</a>  basically going to be coming out of Ashland Street with two new conduits and trenching down Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3283.905s">Originally,</a>  the Century Bank is the customer, but in doing this project, we'll also be able to provide services to the customers on the odd side of Salem Street in conjunction with service getting down to the Century Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3300.658s">I</a>  did submit yesterday, a little bit late in the afternoon, a preliminary traffic plan for review. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3307.303s">I</a>  don't know if we've had time to review that or not, but if approved, we will work with the city engineer to revise that as needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3314.648s">Those</a>  maps?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3317.37s">Those</a>  full maps? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3318.191s">I</a>  think everybody has their maps with them.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3325.597s">Mr.</a>  President? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3329.139s">Mr.</a>  President? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3336.793s">I</a>  have a few questions about just the project in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3341.798s">So</a>  if you could just let us know and let people watching at home know, how long do you think this project is going to take?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3350.586s">That's</a>  going to depend upon the street opening permit and when the work would be allowed if approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3357.112s">I</a>  know that's a heavy congested area. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3361.243s">Depending</a>  upon the digging and the amount of utilities, there's a few things based off of the engineer's comments that we're going to need to address prior to the work once we get that taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3370.891s">I</a>  would say the work would probably take a week, maybe a little bit longer, again, depending upon the digging and the working hours.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3379.338s">And</a>  do you think some of this work will be done at night, or is it mostly to working hours?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3384.65s">Again,</a>  it all depends on how that, on what the city engineer believe, when they issue the permit, if it's gonna be required night work or day work. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3393.112s">It</a>  may make sense to do it at night and we may be able to get more work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3396.533s">I</a>  just don't know what the working hours would be, what would be approved.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3401.434s">And</a>  could you tell us, let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3407.657s">Basically,</a>  with regard to the sidewalks, you're going to be, I think, ripping up a few sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3412.607s">You're</a>  going to be, can you tell us a little bit about, you know, how many sidewalks you're going to rip up? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3418.13s">You're</a>  going to be replacing them with cements? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3420.492s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3420.932s">And</a>  can you tell us, is it two sidewalks, or do you know how many?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3426.097s">I</a>  believe there's three vault locations in the sidewalk there, and I think, I believe, I haven't been out there in a while looking at this, but I believe there's at least two panels getting to where the vault locations, so there's roughly around eight panels total that would need to be replaced in kind.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3443.451s">And</a>  they'll be replaced with concrete?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3445.132s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3446.512s">And</a>  can you tell us, with regard to Ashland Street, what would be the impact on the neighborhood with regard to people being able to access their driveways? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3456.56s">Are</a>  they going to be having problems accessing their driveways?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3459.662s">Not</a>  at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3460.123s">The</a>  first utility pole that we're going to is basically at the corner of Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3464.746s">So</a>  there'd probably be just a couple of parking spaces from the first utility pole down to Salem Street that would be impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3471.311s">And</a>  that work there is probably only going to take a day or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3474.935s">They</a>  would excavate the trench, install the conduit, and backfill it, you know, the same day or night, whatever the case may be.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3482.683s">And</a>  with regard to, you know, we've had a lot of talk during these hearings with regard to paving and how you're going to pave the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3492.794s">needs</a>  to be paid once you're done, you know, opening up the street and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3497.198s">And,</a>  you know, this has been a point of contention with anyone that opens up the street is over time, a lot of these holes, they sink and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3505.987s">And</a>  I noticed that, you know, you're going to be making a payment to the city in lieu of the final payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3512.594s">So</a>  is that payment going to be, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3516.965s">reimbursement</a>  from curb to curb paving or is that going to be just a reimbursement for the section that you cut open?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3525.03s">I'm</a>  not too sure about the reimbursement on the paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3527.632s">I</a>  just recently saw this this morning and only had a short amount of time to kind of circulate this around, but I did see that there was some requirements in there on Ashland Street specifically to pave from the center line of the road to the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3541.843s">So</a>  I'm not sure if the city typically does that paving or if we bring our contractor in. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3546.244s">That's</a>  all something that we would have to work out when the street opening permit was issued.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3553.907s">So</a>  I guess regardless of who's doing the paving, it looks like you're going to be reimbursing for the paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3560.029s">So</a>  I guess my question is basically, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3563.615s">are</a>  you going to be reimbursing for curb to curb? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3566.356s">It</a>  sounds like enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3567.156s">It</a>  sounds like it's going to be maybe just for the sections that you are going to be opening up.</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3571.678s">Based</a>  off of what I saw on this, on the recommendations from the engineer, I can agree to be able to provide this customer service this year and keep the ball kind of moving forward to be able to do the work this excavation season. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3586.023s">I</a>  can agree to these stipulations here that the city engineer had wrote in the agenda.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3594.253s">I</a>  think that might be a little bit of a point of contention. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3597.935s">I</a>  mean, just because I know that we have other utilities have been opening up roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3603.717s">The</a>  last meeting we had, we had a number of utilities that came before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3607.919s">And</a>  they basically promised that they would pave curve to curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3614.242s">And</a>  I feel like we're always setting precedent by doing this now. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3618.144s">And</a>  in some ways, I feel like almost all utilities that come <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3626.65s">colleagues</a>  may have a further comment on that but I just think that we need to make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3635.233s">I</a>  see curb-to-curb repaving, I think it's a necessity just because we have so many, you know, I look at Salem Street, I mean, I think this is a good project, without a doubt, but I look at Salem Street, and that is a heavily traversed street, on a daily basis, and I can easily see, you know, if you're just going to be repairing patches, or even half the road, I could definitely see that being torn up over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3659.668s">It's</a>  a big cut through the street methods because community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3663.55s">And</a>  so I think curve to curve paving would be something that we should look at.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3673.758s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3676.187s">And</a>  first of all, I'd like to say, as someone who's been on the council a number of years, the lack of Wi-Fi in many sections of our downtown business district has always been a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3688.353s">And</a>  I'm glad to see this project moving forward, and I'm glad to hear that this will not only benefit Century Bank, but many other businesses in that Salem Street area. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3699.319s">We</a>  also had a petition three or four weeks back from Comcast to bring Wi-Fi into the old armory building. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3709.282s">And</a>  I know that's under unfinished business, but that's also a section of the square that lacks Wi-Fi. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3717.664s">And</a>  I'm glad to see this finally moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3721.02s">The</a>  question I had, and I think Councilor Falco touched upon it, is of recent the Council has been requesting that projects not be repaved just by trench work, but curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3737.436s">an</a>  issue of contention among this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3740.459s">And</a>  we've had some utility companies that have been willing to step forward and do curb-to-curb, knowing that, in my opinion, that's the best and most efficient way of putting back a street so we don't have to worry about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3756.954s">And</a>  the question I have on this particular proposal <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3760.797s">It</a>  does mention on Ashland Street, which is a highly traveled road also, as a cut through, it says center line to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3770.924s">And</a>  right now, I really would prefer curb to curb on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3776.148s">And</a>  it goes on to say in the last paragraph, it says the city will determine what the need is to replace, and Comcast will either replace or refund the replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3788.236s">What</a>  exactly does that language mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3790.319s">That</a>  doesn't really say much to me.</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3792.542s">That's</a>  something that the city engineer wrote in, so I'm not really sure on clarification on that myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3799.25s">Typically,</a>  we do all our own paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3802.414s">Typically,</a>  we repave the trench. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3806.683s">If</a>  it's a two foot wide trench, we would go two feet on either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3809.665s">But</a>  in this case, it sounds like the engineer wants us to go to the center line of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3813.988s">So</a>  therefore, you would do a temporary patch, then we would bring our contractor back in and then pay from the curb to the center line. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3821.573s">Or</a>  I'm not sure on her, I need to get clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3824.875s">If</a>  we do the temporary patch and then the city brings in their own contractor to do that curb to the center line.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3833.028s">Okay,</a>  and the way I read it is a little different. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3836.091s">I</a>  read it as the city will determine how these streets will be put back. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3840.855s">And</a>  not just whether Comcast will do the work or the city will do the work, but whether it would be curb to curb, centerline to curb, and the city will make that determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3850.739s">And</a>  I think as a member of the council, before we take a vote, we need to know what the parameter is on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3859.943s">And</a>  do you have the ability tonight to make a decision for curb to curb?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3865.545s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3866.746s">And</a>  if that is a request of you tonight, you'd be able to make that?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3869.767s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3870.587s">So</a>  I would put that, Mr. President, as a form of a motion on this paper that all work be done curb-to-curb based on the representative from Comcast on this particular project.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3884.242s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3885.864s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3886.284s">Councilor</a>  Dyke.</p>

    <p>[Brian Dugdale]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3888.327s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3889.944s">Very</a>  difficult for us to sit here and vote on a special permit when we don't have a traffic plan that's for us to review, that there's no clear and concise project schedule as to when this work is going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3902.952s">And</a>  the petitioner comes forward, and they've met their obligations that's been issued by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3908.155s">But</a>  the city engineer has certain criteria and certain parameters that she'd like to see met. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3912.818s">But</a>  before we issue the permit, I think these are things that we also need to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3915.419s">I</a>  mean, we need to know if there's network that's going to be going on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3918.081s">We</a>  need to know if it's going to take eight months for them to fix this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3920.423s">We've</a>  entered into a situation where we have a project with a construction schedule in Medford where the Craddock Bridge, and it's been going on for three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3928.168s">But</a>  we don't know what the construction schedule is. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3930.229s">Now,</a>  it's 160 feet of conduit that's going to be delayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3933.431s">I</a>  think it's important that we deliver Wi-Fi to the business district in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3937.074s">I</a>  think that's going to be a key component for us to help revitalize the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3950.845s">We</a>  need to embrace technology if we're going to be able to do a better job in Medford Square and fill in those stores and making sure that it's a vibrant place that people want to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3958.367s">So</a>  with that being said, I don't have so much problem with the petition or the request that's being made, but I do have a little bit of problem with the information that's provided us from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3965.95s">And</a>  I'd like to see it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3967.79s">You</a>  know, I think Councilor Marks is on the right track. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3971.211s">I</a>  mean, we want to see the curbs paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3973.292s">We</a>  want to see it paved curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3974.692s">That's</a>  been something we've been hounding on for four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3976.953s">It's</a>  a pet peeve of mine when I go down these neighborhood streets and I see French work and grounded inlay work that isn't completed or is completed shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3984.938s">Sometimes</a>  it seems more so that public utility companies that provide gas and electricity than Comcast are more focused on getting the next shovel in the ground than they are about coming back and repairing the damage that they've done in the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3997.965s">So</a>  that's one of the concerns that I have, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3999.887s">Certainly,</a>  I think it's a noble cause, and I think it's a great idea and a great way for us to expand opportunities and methods of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4007.111s">I'm</a>  just a little bit concerned about the fact that we're not being provided with enough information for us to see a full picture, and we're being asked to vote on a special permit this evening without knowing exactly what direction this project is going to go and what to expect after the issuance of the permit.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4021.971s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4022.331s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4023.352s">Mr.</a>  President, I want to thank Councilor Knight for his insight on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4027.975s">A</a>  couple of things were mentioned here tonight, and a couple of things have been sort of brought to light as far as where the community stands on a number of things over this past week, only confirming some of the work that I've been doing for well over a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4044.826s">First,</a>  let me say this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4047.675s">I</a>  think this is a good measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4048.975s">We</a>  need it in the square and Comcast needs to get this work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4054.696s">They're</a>  the primary provider here in the city of Medford and people need this service. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4062.578s">I'm</a>  looking at the language in this petition and what it says to me is that the city engineer has finally gone and she's doing something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4075.752s">to</a>  decide the extent to which that any of these utility operators are going to have to repair our streets and that they're going to be directed by the office of the engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4091.844s">And</a>  if it's curb to curb that the engineer determines is needed, then that's what they're going to provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4098.288s">And</a>  I think we need to have a motion <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4100.83s">an</a>  amendment to this paper that the City Council understands that the language herein, this petition, for this public hearing and to have this work done, is saying that the City Engineer of the City of Medford will determine how much repair work has to be done to these streets and if it is curb to curb, that Comcast understands that and will fund <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4130.43s">the</a>  City of Medford and or their contractor to provide that type of repair to the streets for the people of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4139.817s">Traffic</a>  plans, traffic, digging up sales. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4147.72s">10</a>  of my 12 years on the Council, I've been involved in at least two plans for the revitalization of Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4155.167s">We</a>  had an unveiling to the general public last week of the redevelopment plan that has been presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4167.142s">not</a>  engraved in granite, but pretty close by the MAPC, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, which advises communities in the greater Boston area about planning and development. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4180.013s">We</a>  had several private contractors over the years advise the cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4184.637s">The</a>  plan has had its fits and starts, but we're on the verge of doing something right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4193.524s">And</a>  one of the things that came out of the meeting this past week <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4196.408s">from</a>  citizens of Medford, from people who are eager to see us get going, is that we have to shake it up and make ourselves a little uncomfortable to get things going. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4207.273s">And</a>  one of the things that this project could enable us to do is see what it's like to tighten things up on Salem Street, to use that type of work as a diversion of traffic so the people of Winchester can stop using <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4224.622s">Salem</a>  Street, High Street, and Winthrop Street as their private superhighway. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4230.023s">And</a>  let them find another way. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4231.863s">Let</a>  them go up 93 and get off at Highland Ave, right in their own backyards, rather than going through our backyards and front yards. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4239.305s">So</a>  if it's going to tighten things up on Salem Street for some of the people that use it as their cutthroat to Winchester or to Arlington, all the best to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4251.367s">Let's</a>  look at this, let the engineering department and the community development department <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4260.953s">experiment</a>  with some of the things that were presented to us in this meeting as part of this plan so we can get a feel for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4268.579s">And</a>  I think the citizens of Medford will benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4271.12s">They're</a>  going to benefit from getting this work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4273.482s">Hopefully,</a>  they'll get in there, get it done, and get lost, and give us the service that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4279.566s">And</a>  Mr. President, I'm ready to vote for this and approve for it tonight. <a

you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4287.816s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4288.697s">Thank</a>  my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4289.458s">I</a>  think everybody has brought up some valid points and issues, concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4293.961s">I</a>  appreciate Dave from Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4295.923s">I</a>  don't believe Comcast has any issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4300.607s">I</a>  have any issues with Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4301.868s">I</a>  think you've done your due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4303.709s">I</a>  think that the questions that were brought about this evening, I think that we've <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4310.014s">echo</a>  this my first meeting here at the council and what our roadways and sidewalks are looking at looking like with our utilities after they come in and use Medford for what they want and then just take off I think not I think excluding Comcast because they think that the conversation that we've had and the response that <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4330.3s">You</a>  put forth as your company. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4331.841s">I</a>  think that's been very receptive But I do echo what a few of my colleagues are saying in Which is the biggest point is City engineer we can talk going back and forth about voting and not voting I see but I think that you know my recommendation will be just to table this and have an emergency meeting with the city engineer and <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4354.869s">to</a>  get these questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4358.472s">Traffic</a>  plan, the positive aspect of bringing Wi-Fi in the square, that's a basic necessity I think everybody in our community should have, especially in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4372.003s">But</a>  understanding that how many neighbors will be making sure that they've been notified, both on Ashland and our businesses up and down Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4385.373s">I</a>  don't want to delay this, I want to push it forward, but at the same time I think we need to have these questions answered by our city engineer and her department. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4396.342s">So</a>  I find it, I want to move forward for our businesses and our community, but at the same <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4405.43s">I</a>  think that my colleagues have brought some valid points, unless we have some answers from our city side, and that's our engineer, about a traffic study, our timeline when we're doing the construction, our notification of our neighbors and our business owners, making sure that they were notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4426.342s">making</a>  sure that the pedestrians that are walking those sidewalks during that construction, that it's a safe, traversed area because it does go to one of the busiest bus stops in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4441.398s">If</a>  I could, is there a way through the chair that we can call for a meeting as soon as possible with the city engineer? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4449.325s">Well,</a>  then my motion tonight would be to table and then move forward with trying to get the engineer and moving this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4459.234s">I</a>  don't want to delay it, so it does fall into construction questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4463.297s">but</a>  moving it to get these answers, these questions answered and then hopefully be back at the table by next week and get all these answers that we need that we can bring to our constituents and make sure that the job goes without any issues and it's brought back to <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4481.123s">you</a>  know, with what we've set as a standard here as a council for all of our utilities that we're saying curb to curb and making sure that the construction timeline and notifications are done properly and thoroughly.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4497.968s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4499.209s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4502.75s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4503.97s">I</a>  just want to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4506.208s">I</a>  understand what my colleagues are saying, but did I hear you say you would do curb-to-curb?</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4510.912s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4512.754s">And</a>  if I could also say, I mean, we're open to doing the work at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4516.477s">We</a>  just need to know if we're allowed to do the work at night, what would be the working hours, and then I would be able to give you a schedule to say.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4522.982s">Point</a>  of information, if I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4524.283s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4525.084s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4525.584s">This</a>  is the frustrating part. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4527.866s">This</a>  is something that the engineer, that we should have had from the engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4531.149s">This</a>  is something that you, as the contractor, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4534.632s">for</a>  Comcast, the business owner of Comcast doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4538.256s">So</a>  that's my frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4539.398s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4548.283s">If</a>  it wasn't such a busy thoroughfare in one of our main roads, I'd be ready to approve tonight, especially where you said curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4555.205s">But</a>  if we're going to meet on it next Tuesday at, say, 6 o'clock, if we could just get a copy in by Friday of the traffic plans.</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4562.426s">I</a>  do have a traffic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4563.747s">I</a>  did submit it electronically yesterday, and you probably didn't get it in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4567.248s">And</a>  I do have a copy with me, but I only have one copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4569.928s">Is</a>  this it, Dick? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4572.029s">No,</a>  this isn't the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4573.769s">This</a>  is what you said? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4574.609s">That's</a>  the traffic.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4575.41s">Yeah,</a>  that's the traffic.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4578.314s">We've</a>  got an e-mail.</p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4580.415s">So</a>  again, that all hinges on, I mean, that may change if it's night work. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4584.176s">I</a>  mean, we'd probably be able to get a lot more work done if it's at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4588.137s">But</a>  I need to know, again, the working hours and what would be allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4591.238s">And</a>  if we're going to notify the abutters, I'll need to give them some sort of a schedule.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4595.879s">And</a>  I have it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4597.64s">I</a>  was looking at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4598.26s">It</a>  didn't look like the directions aren't on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4600.621s">But</a>  it does say where the cones will be placed, the signs, the work zone, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4604.922s">So</a>  I guess we do need probably some more clarification of where traffic's going to be diverted. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4610.194s">My</a>  last comment is that we, within our meeting, if we do meet on this, hopefully within the week, that we discuss what the standards are going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4618.882s">I</a>  know I had mentioned a month ago we were requesting curb-to-curb from one company and then with the other company we weren't requesting curb-to-curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4632.533s">So</a>  I just think we need to figure out a way that, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4635.02s">figure</a>  out what we want as a group collectively of going forward for all utility companies so we do it fairly and we require the same thing from every single company. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4645.782s">And</a>  I think the way we're on track with obviously making our streets be repaired much better than they have been and where things are sinking and dipping. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4656.984s">So</a>  I think we're on the right track. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4658.285s">I</a>  just think we need to have a discussion <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4661.357s">in</a>  committee on where we're going with this and make sure our city engineer is on board and thinks it's feasible.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4667.912s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4669.513s">Mr.</a>  President, I don't think that the rub lies with the petitioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4672.075s">I</a>  think that the rub lies with some of the information that we've received. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4676.097s">I</a>  think that we've held a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4677.758s">We've</a>  heard that there's really no outcry of opposition to the approval of this permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4682.781s">I</a>  think that really the issue is whether or not we as a council this evening are comfortable approving this permit with the contingencies that the traffic engineer, I mean that the city engineer submit the traffic mitigation plan and submit the traffic on the project work schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4696.97s">to</a>  the Council for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4698.452s">So</a>  we could this evening, Mr. President, approve the permit with the contingencies that the traffic plan and the schedule of work be submitted to the Council for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4709.062s">So</a>  if the permit can be approved provided that those materials come into the Council and we approve those. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4714.407s">Just</a>  an option, just a way for us to maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4717.25s">move</a>  this along. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4717.95s">I</a>  don't think the problem lies with the gentleman from Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4720.091s">As</a>  I said, we just need a little bit more information to feel comfortable moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4723.613s">We</a>  could approve the permit with the contingencies that the city engineer provided us with the traffic mitigation plan and with the concise work schedule for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4731.097s">And</a>  upon our approval, the permit will be issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4733.158s">But</a>  we don't need to bring the gentleman back. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4734.499s">I</a>  don't think we need to even have another public hearing on the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4736.66s">We</a>  can just ask that material to be forwarded to us and then vote as to whether or not we're comfortable issuing the permit at a later date.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4743.006s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4743.806s">Mr.</a>  President, I think Councilor Knight is right, if I understood him, in that my amendment was to clarify this language as we're clarifying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4755.512s">If</a>  we accept this amendment, we've clarified it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4758.493s">We</a>  want, and I think if we can understand a consensus that's come out of our <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4763.9s">discussions</a>  over the past year or two where this has become such a problem is that the engineer needs to supervise this better, these types of projects better, and hold the contractors accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4780.254s">And</a>  it seems to me the way I read this language <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4784.164s">here</a>  in what she's added is that she's gotten it and she's doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4789.427s">And</a>  I'm comfortable letting the engineering department determine with the contractor the scope to which the repairs need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4801.933s">So</a>  if the engineer believes that it serves the people of Medford best, that it be curb to curb, then she's going to demand that of these contractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4811.537s">Quite</a>  frankly, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4812.758s">I'm</a>  not qualified. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4814.12s">I'm</a>  not an engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4815.641s">I'm</a>  not a construction person. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4817.723s">I</a>  can shovel snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4819.405s">I'm</a>  pretty good with leaves. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4821.868s">Every</a>  morning you'll see me at 6, between 6 and 7, sweeping cigarette butts in front of my office. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4828.662s">That's</a>  the scope of my construction skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4831.324s">But</a>  the engineer and her staff understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4836.368s">This</a>  is their profession. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4838.449s">And</a>  it seems to me, again, that they've gotten what they've asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4843.333s">And</a>  I think we should allow them, I don't think it would be wise on our part to mandate extremes where they're not necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4852.9s">I</a>  think that the construction people need to be aware that National's Ridge had some serious problems historically in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4862.909s">So</a>  I think you're aware of that, that there's been some problems over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4867.613s">And</a>  as far as the traffic plane goes, if the engineer and the police department has signed off on that, that's never been our area of <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4878.161s">approval,</a>  and certainly day-to-day will mandate how the traffic needs to be dealt with, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4886.903s">So</a>  with the amendment that I've proposed, as I said earlier, I'm pleased and comfortable making an approval here, and I don't think we need to hold it up, nor do we need to have an emergency meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4901.927s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli has a motion.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4905.808s">If</a>  I can, I would rescind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4907.149s">I</a>  appreciate Councilor Knight and Councilor Dello Russo's initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4911.991s">I</a>  think that, again, my biggest concern is that what we set forth, I think, not only curb to curb, I appreciate that, move forward with that, but the idea of when the construction will, what's the timeline for the construction, and where the <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4929.869s">making</a>  sure that the neighbors were notified and having the understanding that personally I would rather see it done at night, especially if there isn't a residential area that's being, you know, if we could put that forward, the recommendation that it eliminates some of that congestion in Medford Square and to help our business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4952.923s">the</a>  neighbors in that area, I'd be willing to take that off and make that as part of the amendment that goes forth to the city engineer.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4962.205s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4963.146s">Councilor</a>  Layton.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4964.146s">So</a>  as I understand it, Mr. President, the matter is that right now before the council would be moving for approval of the permit with the contingency that the gentleman has agreed to a curb to curb repaving that the city solicitor, I mean, the city engineer is going to report back to us what the construction schedule is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4980.57s">And</a>  that the city engineer is going to also provide us with an updated traffic management plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4985.053s">And</a>  the council would also be issuing a recommendation that the work be done off hours during the evening as to not impact negatively the local businesses or the traffic flow in the area.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4996.38s">And</a>  the, if I can, the notification to the neighbors again that they are given, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5003.164s">the</a>  proper timeline so they can understand what's going on in that section.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5006.708s">Summarized</a>  perfectly.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5007.889s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5008.229s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[David McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5016.682s">David</a>  McKillip, 94 Rock Glen Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5019.723s">One</a>  of the things that I just want to kind of touch base on is the curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5023.946s">I</a>  think that Councilwoman Longo-Curran is 100% right, as well as Councilman Marks and a few others. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5030.989s">My</a>  recommendation on the curb to curb is that you folks get together and come up <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5042.947s">and</a>  project to project, it might not have the best resolution for one particular street. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5051.551s">So</a>  in other words, if they open up another section of a street and that opening might be four feet by six feet or five feet by eight feet, whatever it is, but there are four other openings on that street, that street has become a disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5065.056s">So</a>  I don't agree with the fact that we're getting a little bit better because some of those streets have anywhere from <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5070.818s">two</a>  and three patches to five and seven patches. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5073.859s">So</a>  I think having a parameter set up where that person or that company has to be responsible for a curb to curb based off of length, width, depth, and the amount of openings that have already occurred on that street is probably a better direction to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5089.126s">So</a>  it's now something that you can use as a guideline as opposed to going from project to project. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5094.712s">And</a>  I think that's something that you should do prior to making these decisions going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5100.017s">I</a>  agree with Councilor Scarpelli of tabling this item and considering that prior to making those decisions, even though that they've already agreed to curve to curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5110.827s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5111.988s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Costas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5117.413s">Hello,</a>  General Ancalastas, 25 Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5123.563s">I</a>  understand everybody's concerns, and they're all valid, street safety, the whole nine yards. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5128.747s">And</a>  we have to hold somebody accountable for something. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5133.391s">So</a>  I'm not going to disregard as being not important. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5137.375s">It</a>  is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5139.116s">But</a>  my part of Salem Street and behind Riverside Ave, we've been waiting a very, very long time for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5147.663s">Now,</a>  I went 30 years without anything but DSL. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5152.579s">Now</a>  we're fortunate enough that Verizon came in with Fiverr, and that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5157.74s">But</a>  at this point, they're the only game in town for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5161.341s">So</a>  whatever they want, if we need a high-speed internet, we're going to go to Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5165.802s">I</a>  do have Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5168.263s">Comcast</a>  has done their homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5170.403s">They</a>  signed up a whole lot of businesses that would be interested in going to Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5176.225s">And</a>  the savings is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5178.205s">So</a>  what I don't want to see happen is as much as <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5181.839s">All</a>  these details are important. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5183.06s">I</a>  don't want to see Medford Square end up being kind of like, you know, a tug of war. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5189.462s">Well,</a>  we're going to hold Medford Square hostage until everything is where it's supposed to be exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5195.425s">And</a>  in the meantime, us businesses on the square, we're just going to keep paying the higher rate to Verizon waiting for, you know, our expenditure to do what they need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5204.189s">So</a>  whatever the council can do to move this along quicker, and I like the idea of the approval and then <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5211.972s">if</a>  you're satisfied with what they submit, you know, move forward and not come back to another public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5218.317s">So</a>  please, you know, let's move this along as quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5221.28s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5222.521s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5223.742s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5253.232s">I</a>  would ask if we could do it within the next 14 days rather than a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5257.075s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5258.536s">I</a>  do believe we had that meeting already. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5259.817s">We</a>  posed a series of questions to the city solicitor as to whether or not we could restrict the number of permits that are issued in the year, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5266.181s">I</a>  think that maybe we want to reiterate our need for a response to that paper as well.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5271.098s">And</a>  I think we need to go one step further and create guidelines amongst the seven of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5275.02s">And</a>  I don't think that was specifically done at the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5278.021s">And</a>  I agree, we do have unanswered questions that, um, there are a lot of things we asked Cassandra or Cassandra's office to be able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5285.604s">And</a>  I think that's important to get some answers so we can regulate the companies and the work they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5290.326s">Mr.</a>  Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5290.626s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5291.026s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Dave Flewelling]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5382.57s">Yeah,</a>  I didn't think that it was curb-to-curb, I thought it was half.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5457.087s">It</a>  was tabled based on a roll call vote, four in the affirmative, three in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5463.531s">I</a>  believe it was tabled for the purpose of receiving the answers to the questions that we had posed to the administration, but it doesn't say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5469.935s">It</a>  just says upon motion to table a roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5474.538s">And</a>  it's not reflecting.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5476.74s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5479.161s">I</a>  happen to recall the discussion from three, four weeks ago <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5486.333s">even</a>  though I don't remember what I had for dinner last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5489.536s">I</a>  do recall that discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5492.199s">And</a>  at the time, the gentleman from Comcast, when we asked him if he could do a curb-to-curb, said he didn't have the authority to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5502.067s">So</a>  we asked him to go back and find out if that was in the specs to do curb-to-curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5508.033s">So</a>  I think that's where we left off, because that particular night, as you recall, we also asked <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5513.237s">another</a>  utility company, and they agreed to do curb-to-curb, but they had someone in the room that had the ability to make that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5519.399s">So</a>  I don't know if this gentleman for the High Street project, which is going into the armory, I believe it's for a medical business that's in the armory that needs internet access. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5532.084s">So</a>  maybe if we can pose that question to the gentleman.</p>

    <p>[Paul Mochi]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5937.076s">Yes,</a>  Councilor Lungo-Koehn, there was a reason why it took so long. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5943.604s">to</a>  Hawaii, and during that time, we were in the process of contacting a management company, which took quite a while, and what ended up happening, we had to put a lien on the house, and it took several, after the lien was put on, the vendor took several months to give us his invoice, and then once we got the invoice, we had to wait another several months for the attorney that closed on the property to pay, to give us a check for the lien that we had placed on the property.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5972.622s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5972.823s">Mr.</a>  President? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5975.041s">Mr.</a>  Moore, you said that the Thompson Plumbing Company went out to this site twice? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5981.325s">Two</a>  separate occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5982.846s">And</a>  the total bill was only $545? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5985.248s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5985.628s">That's</a>  quite a deal.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6045.542s">Alicia</a>  Hunt, 41 Watson Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6046.643s">So</a>  basically, this is, sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6053.643s">I</a>  expected to have it all read, so I am going to summarize it for you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6058.688s">This</a>  is a request for $348,336 from Free Cash, the information you typically request is there in the paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6063.132s">The</a>  first $256,000 is to upgrade the lights at the Andrews School to controllable LED lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6078.325s">This</a>  is a natural next step after the other work that we've done in the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6082.247s">You</a>  might be aware that last winter we did the Curtis Tops to LED lights interior. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6087.049s">We</a>  did some of the hallways and some other LED light projects at the schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6091.191s">This</a>  is the direction that the industry is moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6094.013s">Our</a>  DPW was built with all LED lights as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6099.335s">This</a>  particular project is being, I'm asking for this money to do this project at this time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6104.737s">because</a>  this will serve as the city's match to a grant the state that we and B2Q Consulting received from the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6113.981s">So</a>  the lighting project on its own makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6117.782s">It'll</a>  save the city about $22,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6121.423s">But</a>  if we do it at this time, we can use it as our share on this grant project. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6127.766s">The</a>  grant is to do electricity peak demand reduction, and it's a pilot for the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6134.375s">So</a>  basically, the state gave B2Q and the city money to work on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6139.778s">The</a>  grant itself is $478,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6144.6s">And</a>  as well, National Grid is very interested in how this would work. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6148.722s">And</a>  they have committed $125,000 of technical assistance time on this specific project. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6156.466s">And</a>  the project would actually run in the Andrews School and the DPW. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6161.622s">We'll</a>  get additionally, they'll be upgrading the controls in the schools and the DPW to be able to control the lights in both of those buildings through our computer system, as well as doing additional upgrades to the heating and cooling system and their controls, how we run it, energy efficiency. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6180.117s">It</a>  is also likely that we would get revenue from the demand response program. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6184.621s">The</a>  amount of that revenue is very dependent on <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6187.843s">The</a>  whole process, we're still doing the feasibility part of it that determines how much electricity we would actually produce through these programs during peak demand time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6199.406s">That's</a>  one piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6200.826s">The</a>  other part of the money is $83,000 that would serve as a match for another grant that we received from the Department of Energy Resources that would add battery and the ability to run solar off grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6215.91s">to</a>  the DPW and the Andrews School. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6218.231s">And</a>  as you know, we're in the process of putting solar on the DPWs. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6221.212s">This</a>  adds battery to that.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6222.573s">Excuse</a>  me.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6223.373s">Yeah?</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6224.033s">Can</a>  you repeat the figure you just said?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6226.094s">So</a>  which, OK.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6228.015s">The</a>  amount awarded by the grant from the Department of Energy?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6230.356s">So</a>  the first grant is $478,688. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6232.517s">No,</a>  no. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6234.337s">The</a>  second grant, I'm asking for $83,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6243.503s">I</a>  can be more specific. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6244.963s">$83,336</a>  serves as a match. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6246.264s">It</a>  is 10% of the grant amount. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6247.364s">Hold</a>  on a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6248.724s">Because</a>  we have it as $833,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6249.805s">No,</a>  the grant is $833,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6250.625s">Yes,</a>  so the grant is an $833,000 and change grant.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6252.685s">And</a>  so our match is 10% that we need to have in hand as we begin the project.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6271.501s">So</a>  battery is very, very expensive to pair with solar, and we believe it's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6277.364s">It'll</a>  allow us to run these buildings off grid when the electricity is down, and the grant will pay for this battery that would go with both the solar systems, the one we're in the process of, and the one that is planned at the, that will be coming eventually, our future, we have to redo the roof at the Andrews School before we come forward with a solid proposal on solar for that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6301.26s">So</a>  that's the whole package altogether.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6303.841s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6304.482s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6305.382s">Councilor</a>  Falco. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6306.243s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6307.603s">And</a>  thank you for this report, Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6310.285s">Hunt</a>  and Superintendent Pendleton. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6313.066s">I</a>  think this is a great opportunity, and I think it's a great program. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6315.748s">And</a>  I'm glad to see that we're getting grant funding for this type of project. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6320.33s">Can</a>  you talk a little bit about the impact on the schools with regard to when this project will take place and how the students will be impacted?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6329.529s">Right,</a>  so the lighting project, it would be our intention to do it second shift, so they would be in there 3 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6337.654s">to</a>  11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6338.834s">in</a>  order to do that piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6341.616s">Solar,</a>  if and when we are able, so we'll need to do a new roof and solar. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6346.959s">My</a>  hope is that we could get something lined up for next summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6351.008s">But</a>  that is still the chunk to come. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6354.449s">The</a>  battery piece of it would actually be completely out of the way in the back area, not where students are. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6362.31s">There's</a>  a separate entrance into the electrical rooms where we have generators and HVAC equipment. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6368.411s">So</a>  the contractors, when they do do work, could work in that area without ever having to go into the main portion of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6377.292s">Or</a>  they could go in through the main portion, check in with the <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6380.813s">with</a>  the security, but then they would just traverse through the building and be in that back area and never have to actually be in student areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6390.161s">I</a>  also know the superintendent is here to speak to some of this as well.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6395.505s">If</a>  I may, what would be the duration of the project? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6398.227s">How</a>  long would it take to replace all the lights?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6401.963s">A</a>  couple of weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6403.364s">So</a>  I will tell you that this is a large project, so it would have to be bid out. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6407.085s">And</a>  part of the bidding out process is to ask the contractors, you know, how long will it take? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6411.887s">Because</a>  some contractors will put one crew on and do it over many weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6416.589s">Other</a>  contractors will say, I have 10 crews, and I'll get it done in three days. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6421.271s">So</a>  because it's going to be a project that would be bid out, I cannot tell you now. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6427.834s">And</a>  I can't bid it out until we're at that stage of the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6431.977s">is</a>  when we would have to schedule.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6434.199s">Mr.</a>  Superintendent, it sounds like there could be some workers in the building while the students are there, while the workers be quarried and whatnot.</p>

    <p>[Roy Belson]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6444.826s">If</a>  there is any time in which a worker is in the building, that worker would be quarried, even if he's working second shift, because there are programs that run in the afternoons. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6456.333s">So</a>  we would quarry anyone that might have the opportunity to be unsupervised with young people.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6462.508s">make</a>  sure that we're doing everything we can. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6465.532s">It's</a>  a pretty big project. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6468.236s">There'll</a>  be a lot of people in the building, so just want to make sure we're protecting our students. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6471.661s">So,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6478.589s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6480.89s">Alicia,</a>  regarding the paired battery storage, will we be able to accept additional electricity from the current windmill and also provide that to the battery storage?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6498.66s">The</a>  wind turbine is actually connected to the McGlynn School, not the Andrews School, so it would not be connected to this battery. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6508.398s">Right,</a>  but we couldn't connect one to the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6510.981s">I</a>  mean, the schools are on the same property, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6525.327s">The</a>  wind turbine doesn't make as much electricity compared to what a solar installation does to make it worth the amount of electrical work you would have to do to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6534.91s">There'd</a>  also be a lot of changes to the control system in order to take in that separate, very different input. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6545.203s">I</a>  hope that at some point in the future we'd be able to do a similar project at the McGlynn School, and at which point we would have the wind turbine. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6552.865s">We</a>  would also have the benefit of having done this project at the Andrew School first.</p>

    <p>[Clerk]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6559.206s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6562.027s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6562.307s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6563.607s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6563.967s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6565.427s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6566.428s">Hunt,</a>  thank you very much for your work. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6568.328s">I'm</a>  looking at this paper and reading what it says. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6573.218s">grant</a>  for this, grant for that, grant for this, and I know that those grants didn't write themselves, and I think that you deserve a lot of credit for going out there and finding the money. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6582.047s">So</a>  thank you very much for your effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6584.549s">In</a>  looking at this paper, I mean, we have $265,000 to upgrade the LED lights at the Andrews. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6591.295s">My</a>  math, as spooky as it is, would come back and show that we have about <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6596.08s">12-year</a>  return on our investment. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6598.221s">We're</a>  going to save about $22,000 a year if we convert to the LED lighting, and we'll be able to capture this investment within a period of about 12 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6607.268s">I</a>  also understand that this $83,000 is a 10% match on the battery, correct? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6609.489s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6609.75s">And</a>  if you add the $265,000 and the $83,000, we come up with a figure of $348,000. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6620.738s">So</a>  this appropriations are $348,000, but we're also looking at $100,000 grant. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6622.92s">A</a>  $478,000 grant? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6623.261s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6623.341s">A</a>  $125,000 grant? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6623.541s">So</a>  the $100,000 is</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6637.34s">There</a>  are two different numbers from National Grid. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6639.761s">One</a>  is an incentive for the lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6643.564s">So</a>  the lighting project is actually more expensive than this, so that comes in to offset the cost of the lighting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6650.428s">And</a>  the other is that National Grid will put technical assistance in to this project, which honestly, I feel is very notable that they've actually said that this project is interesting enough to them that they want to put that much of their own technical time <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6666.077s">which</a>  is a project to make this work. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6669.559s">But</a>  it's the equivalent of $125,000 in national grid time.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6674.242s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6675.163s">So,</a>  and looking at all the grant money or the matching funds that have been awarded to the city, how much money are we talking here?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6686.77s">I</a>  have not done that math. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6689.932s">So,</a>  but we're looking at like 833 and 478, so that's, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6694.451s">close</a>  to one plus the $100,000, on the order of $1.3 million of money that'll be coming into city buildings.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6702.836s">So</a>  this evening you're asking for us to make an investment of $348,000 so that we can get a return on that investment of over a million dollars?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6709.92s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6710.441s">I'm</a>  comfortable voting for this this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6712.122s">Thank</a>  you very much for your work, Mr. President, and for approval.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6716.204s">Councilor</a>  Lungo-Koehn. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6717.044s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6718.725s">Ms.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6720.066s">Huntwell,</a>  we have you before us, and we're talking about the Andrews School. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6723.453s">Can</a>  you give us an update on the test borings that were done very close to there and whether or not they were done behind the Andrews School, any results that may be coming back?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6732.298s">Right,</a>  so I do believe that there is a response in your packets that is from the motion prior about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6741.003s">I'm</a>  happy to speak to it for a minute or two. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6745.275s">I</a>  don't have the response that went to you in front of me, but we did the test scoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6751.757s">We</a>  found that there were two locations that had very high levels deep down. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6758.758s">One</a>  was, gosh, my brain is gonna stop on that, lead, and the other was very unusual, like, threw me for a loop. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6766.96s">I</a>  believe it was zinc, is that right, that's in there? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6770.321s">And</a>  I didn't even know prior that it could be contaminating. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6774.017s">And</a>  so those two locations, we need to do, so we did testing in the grid, and two spots showed up with high levels, and now we need to, oh, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6787.287s">I</a>  really appreciate that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6791.798s">I</a>  did not refresh myself on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6795.942s">Yes,</a>  zinc. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6797.663s">Sorry,</a>  it's such an odd thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6800.206s">I</a>  was not aware that zinc at a high level could be a soil contaminant until we got involved in this project. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6805.851s">So</a>  I always question myself when I say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6809.101s">So</a>  those two spots are very high and actually either have to be removed or we have to do extensive room reporting and testing to the state that would be extremely costly to removing those areas. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6821.609s">So</a>  we need to do testing around those locations to find out exactly so we know where there is a problem and we know these areas where there isn't and we want to test in closer to see how small of an area can we deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6835.658s">So</a>  it might be that we put <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6837.483s">you</a>  know, a bench and a paved area and a bench over the zinc location, or it may be that we dig a hole and dig it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6846.905s">And</a>  we need to, in order to do one of those things, do a little bit more testing to understand those locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6853.087s">We</a>  haven't yet tested on the other side of the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6857.469s">The</a>  lead level is actually very close to the sidewalk, and so as part of narrowing that, we are going to need to go on the other side of the sidewalk and do that testing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6867.236s">But</a>  we've sort of been waiting to get it all done at the same time and not do that separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6874.342s">There</a>  were two areas that had petroleum and PCBs, which we also have to do some further <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6881.407s">to</a>  understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6882.628s">The</a>  other thing that was notable that I mentioned in here, one of the other properties, they have had a problem with their groundwater that they are very aware of. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6893.436s">And</a>  one of the questions that had come up to me, and what prompted this testing partially in part was, was this problem in the groundwater under our property? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6905.164s">And</a>  we did not find any of that under our property. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6909.553s">So</a>  additionally, some of the area within the fence belongs to the Department of Conservation and Recreation, DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6916.823s">That</a>  area has been delineated. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6918.665s">We</a>  have not been doing testing on that area, but we are in close contact with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6923.031s">I,</a>  in fact, discussed that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6925.835s">with</a>  them today, and they're very interested in working with us to be able to do a solution that provides safety and protection to everybody, but is as minimal expense and actually impact to the area as possible. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6942.74s">And</a>  with their extensive experience in these sorts of problems, I think we're going to be able to do things a little bit better because they're going to be a partner with us on this.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6953.786s">Thank</a>  you very much for the update. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6955.428s">We</a>  do have it in our packet. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6957.81s">There</a>  are a number of parents that have been asking me questions, you know, so I wanted you to state it publicly. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6962.455s">And</a>  just so I have it clearly after reading it and after your explanation, test pourings were done at the clippership part section. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6969.722s">The</a>  lead and the zinc were found. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6971.279s">but</a>  there will be, as requested by the council, there will be some pourings on the other side of the walkway, which is behind Andrews, where the children play soccer and whatnot.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6980.986s">Right,</a>  so I do not anticipate that we would go up onto the soccer field. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6985.83s">We</a>  were able to find the records, so when those schools were built, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6990.557s">They</a>  found arsenic in that area, and the area was low enough that they were legally allowed to close the site without doing anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=6999.365s">But</a>  they came in and put clean fill over that whole area, but it was <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7006.05s">after</a>  the fact that the area was closed with the state as being acceptable as is, but then the city came in and put the clean fill on anyhow. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7016.701s">So</a>  the records on that and exactly the locations are a little different, but it's pretty clear to the eye that where the soccer field raises up is part of that area with the clean fill on top. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7028.812s">and</a>  which makes us very comfortable about that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7031.514s">And</a>  it's just the part that slopes down to the pathway where you might say, well, that doesn't look like there's clean fill on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7040.28s">And</a>  so that's where some of these borings are going to be.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7043.462s">And</a>  then can you just lastly just give us a time frame so we know when to request an update?</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7049.946s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7051.6s">So</a>  I'm hoping to do that over the next four to six weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7055.921s">Some</a>  of it is scheduling with the equipment that is necessary to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7063.384s">And</a>  finalizing it all. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7064.644s">We've</a>  been waiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7065.345s">Honestly,</a>  our point of contract at the state <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7069.566s">The</a>  Environmental Protection Office has been out for three weeks on leave, and we really wanted him to see our most recent report and discuss it with him, and he returned from leave yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7080.095s">So</a>  before I schedule the borings, I do want to review with him the results of our</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7115.826s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7116.227s">My</a>  colleague asked the questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7117.727s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7118.427s">Move</a>  approval, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7120.968s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor— Second. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7123.729s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor— Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7125.958s">Vice</a>  President Mox.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7126.718s">Just</a>  if we could, if we can also, while we have Alicia here, if you can give us just a brief update on where we stand with the lighting in the square.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7135.823s">So,</a>  the lighting of the square has been folded in with our larger city lighting project, and I actually spoke with our consultants at Lantham, oh my gosh, on Monday, yesterday, about the history of those lights, what are in those various fixtures, what we're looking for, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7156.155s">Based</a>  on what I've said and the observations, and I'd love feedback, but my impression is that most people are happy with the light levels at the Peace Garden. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7167.839s">Those</a>  are the same fixtures, but much brighter. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7171.24s">And</a>  so I believe that we'll be able, through this project, to install equivalent <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7179.006s">light</a>  bulbs, basically, from what's in the Peace Garden into the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7182.893s">For</a>  technical reasons, under an energy efficiency project, I could never put those in because it would be increasing the electricity that's used. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7193.318s">And</a>  that would fall outside of any kind of grant money I could do, or I would have to put that out to bid. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7199.541s">Under</a>  our larger lighting project, it's probably the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7204.183s">And</a>  that will increase the electricity usage on those lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7209.085s">But</a>  at this point, I think most people would agree that's the right thing to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7213.587s">And</a>  we'll be decreasing the light, the electricity usage throughout the rest of the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7219.997s">So</a>  that is our tentative plan, and I've asked them to get me that information. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7225.501s">concretely</a>  as quickly as possible to move that forward faster than the main project. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7231.545s">But</a>  I'm not sure what the timing on that would be and whether there's an appetite for coming forward with a request for just that chunk of money separate from the main lighting project.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7243.652s">Originally,</a>  it started off as a standalone project.</p>

    <p>[Alicia Hunt]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7246.054s">Yes,</a>  it did. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7246.934s">And</a>  we were trying to make it an energy efficiency project that we could procure through energy <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7253.599s">through</a>  the Green Communities Act at the state level and you can't do it in an energy-efficient manner and fix the light levels there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7725.663s">Thank</a>  you, Brian. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7726.564s">As</a>  Mr. Dundale just presented, we're here for the application, once again, for extension of the hours of operation, specifically the special use permit modification on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7738.353s">And</a>  with that, currently it's allowed, as the council knows, 7 AM to 11 PM. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7743.377s">With</a>  consideration of the weather in the Northeast, of the states here obviously, as well as the traffic in the area, we're seeking an extension on either end by simply one hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7755.904s">That</a>  being allowing 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7758.386s">till</a>  midnight hours of operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7761.367s">Hours</a>  of operation meaning allowing the store to be open for the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7766.533s">With</a>  that, understanding and speaking to the residents, more specifically the residents of Mystic Condos right behind us, as noted by the council on the 815th, the question I think was raised, have we reached out? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7781.478s">And</a>  in fact, we had reached out and had communications prior to that to a representative of the condo. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7786.54s">As</a>  of today, we've had conversations with representative of the condo. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7791.442s">recognizing</a>  their adjacent neighbors, being a good neighbor, and in the culture of a community partner, both on the business level, where we've reached out, even as of recent of August 15th, we've invited and had a special meeting with local leaders of the community, the school superintendent, United Way Food Bank, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7811.277s">food</a>  bank, et cetera, recognizing that we are part of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7816.278s">We</a>  are in this fine community and are very respectful for that and are involved across the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7826.86s">So</a>  as we are engaged with the community through the community leaders, we are also respective of our neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7832.881s">Therefore,</a>  the reach out, once again, prior to the August 15th and up as of late yesterday. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7839.822s">And</a>  as Mr. Dugdale noted, we will self-restrict overnight deliveries, mimicking the hours of operations for the board to grant the application request. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7850.685s">With</a>  that, I'd be glad to address any questions from the council.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7855.167s">Councilwoman</a>  O'Connor.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7856.307s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7858.468s">If</a>  you or Brian could go over the no overnight loading deliveries, scaled loading, landscaping, if you just could go into more detail. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7869.412s">Because</a>  the only complaints or questions that I've received from the residents that live behind there are worries about overnight deliveries, the noise, obviously, how the property looks. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7884.201s">But</a>  other than that, I really haven't. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7886.002s">I</a>  want to just make sure those are addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7887.963s">If</a>  you could just give hours in regards to those.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7890.625s">So</a>  it's very simplistic here again. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7894.13s">The</a>  application, and that's the beauty of it, currently 7-11 store operations allowing our customers to come into the store with consideration of many families have two of the adults working in the family, school activities. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7911.101s">And</a>  just a desire to get into the store and do shopping on the way to work or after work and allows them that flexibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7918.489s">So</a>  here again, the key point is hours of operations of the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7922.693s">Tied</a>  in with that, we will self-restrict out of consideration to the neighbors and not have tractor trailer deliveries at the rear of the store from midnight till 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7932.222s">in</a>  the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7934.458s">As</a>  far as the property here again, New England Development has committed to, as evidenced by Mr. Dugdale's statements there, that they are committed to a number of additional landscaping treatments at the rear of the store, the property line, the fencing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7950.806s">including</a>  access across the driveway to the condo development. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7955.849s">As</a>  far as the site overall itself, I think that speaks for itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7959.312s">As</a>  Mr. Dugtel had made presentation, it's a very beautiful upgrade from what the development had been. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7967.677s">I</a>  hope that addresses your question.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7970.439s">Vice</a>  President Maxt. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7972.667s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7974.048s">And</a>  by no way am I speaking on behalf of the residents of Mr. Condos. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7980.912s">However,</a>  the phone calls that I received from residents mainly were regarding the deliveries. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=7990.598s">And</a>  there's roughly 132 units that directly face the rear of your establishment. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8000.319s">And</a>  I would say within approximately 200 feet from the rear of where deliveries will take place, give or take. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8009.905s">And</a>  I think the concern that I've been hearing from residents is, and I appreciate the fact that you're saying no overnights, but when a truck rolls up at 11, 11.30, quarter or 12, to me, that's a late hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8025.075s">Or</a>  when it rolls up at 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8026.896s">in</a>  the morning, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8029.55s">That's</a>  an early hour, and I can appreciate the fact that you have sealed loading docks, and you're taking steps to minimize the noise impact of the Mystic condo residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8043.998s">However,</a>  in my opinion, in order for this to be acceptable to Wegmans, who we welcome you to the community, I look forward to shopping in Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8053.984s">I</a>  currently have to go out to Burlington now, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8056.165s">to</a>  shop at Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8057.646s">And</a>  we welcome you here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8059.226s">The</a>  residents that I've spoken with in the condos also are eager to shop in your facility. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8066.069s">But</a>  the concern is the deliveries. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8068.81s">And</a>  I would ask that the deliveries be limited not to just your hours of operation, but to hours that are acceptable to, even though you're in a commercial zoned area, to residential abutters. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8085.498s">And</a>  that would be my first point, if you're willing to make a concession. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8090.737s">on</a>  those particular hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8093.258s">And</a>  knowing that, you know, that's the heart of a business, deliveries, and I understand that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8099.601s">So</a>  that would be my first. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8101.102s">The</a>  second point residents have noticed that I spoke with was having nothing to do with delivery trucks, but the exhaust unit on top of your building, which is the size of a small bus. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8115.788s">And</a>  recently that exhaust unit has been functioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8119.233s">I</a>  don't know if they're testing it or what's going on, but it emits a rather loud and frequent noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8127.885s">And</a>  I was wondering if there's any consideration to put additional buffers. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8133.392s">I</a>  know with other business establishments, we just had something on Riverside Ave, Smashburger, and a few other establishments that had something similar, not to the size that you have for exhaust, and they were able to put noise buffers to mitigate some of the noise for area residents that were roughly in the same proximity. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8153.116s">I</a>  was wondering if you could speak on that also. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8155.277s">So</a>  it would be limiting the delivery hours, not to just your hours of operation, but to extend it further. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8161.998s">and</a>  also the exhaust on top of the building.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8164.879s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8165.399s">Let</a>  me work backwards on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8166.639s">Certainly,</a>  as far as the rooftop units, we use state-of-the-art units. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8171.12s">We</a>  offer to this council, and certainly to the building department and any professionals they have on staff, we can certainly review with the town engineer, here again, through you, with you, the specific specifications of those units, and if there's the possibility to look at possible mitigation measures on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8189.555s">As</a>  far as the deliveries, we are not speaking a large number of tractor trailers from 11 to midnight, or between 11 and midnight and 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8198.802s">in</a>  the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8199.723s">We're</a>  talking one, two at the extreme, and the standard time of year, and that's once seven days a week. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8208.91s">So</a>  we're talking one tractor trailer, the anomaly of two at that one hour at the extreme and one hour in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8215.515s">And</a>  here again, we will be in compliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8218.44s">We're</a>  committed to it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8219.461s">We</a>  are in all communities being in compliance with town codes, city codes, or noise ordinances in this particular case. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8226.471s">And</a>  we have, the city council has, that <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8230.828s">if</a>  you will, that safeguard to come to us and saying you're in violation. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8236.173s">But</a>  quite frankly, before that happens, we'll be the first to hear in our store operations, our store managers. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8242.979s">This</a>  is not the first store we're adjacent to a residential unit. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8247.023s">We</a>  have at least a dozen of them in our chains. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8249.505s">And</a>  we have worked through many issues, if there were issues to begin with. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8253.849s">And</a>  that's where we would offer, here again, self-restricted overnight deliveries, but keep up to midnight, with the understanding that it would be one, two, at the extreme as far as the anomaly, and that is in that particular hour, at the end and at the beginning. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8271.115s">And</a>  here again, it comes to, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8274.063s">It</a>  does come down to the basics of the weather and transportation and the overload of the highways. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8280.949s">These</a>  tractor trailers are coming from Rochester, New York. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8283.371s">It's</a>  six plus hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8285.392s">So</a>  we have the folks that are familiar or in the business themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8290.036s">I'm</a>  not telling them anything new. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8291.898s">The</a>  logistics on getting stuff from a warehouse into a truck, 300 miles away, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8304.217s">There's</a>  six hours away. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8305.358s">It's</a>  very difficult, and it's a challenging month of flexibility. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8309.6s">That</a>  will allow us as a free board, and where we can, we will try to keep it to 11 and not 5 to 12 or 11.45. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8318.925s">Our</a>  intent is not to push it to the limits, but give a little latitude to remain a flexible, productive, successful business for the benefit, obviously, our business and then the community.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8333.802s">So</a>  from what I'm hearing from you, and I appreciate the flexibility, but not at the expense of the residents that live within 200 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8343.094s">And</a>  I appreciate the fact that these trucks are going to be coming from Rochester, New York, the fact that there's New England weather involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8350.564s">and</a>  so forth, and that makes me even feel more comfortable with my decision not to go right to midnight, because I think what we're going to end up seeing, and I've been doing this for a number of years, is that we're going to see the later deliveries, and we're going to see the 11, 30, 12 o'clock, a truck shows up at midnight, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8372.442s">or</a>  10 past midnight with $300,000 worth of filet mignon, I'm sure you're going to unload it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8379.787s">I</a>  can commit to Mr. Councilman and to this council and to the community, we would self-restrict on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8385.63s">We</a>  start hearing those concerns, our tractor trailer drivers, if that starts happening, we will be the first to rein that in. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8393.635s">And</a>  adjusted accordingly, but that's where we're asking for that flexibility under the recognition. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8398.642s">We</a>  are a partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8400.064s">We</a>  are a community neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8402.848s">We</a>  ask for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8406.214s">assistance,</a>  if you will, and allow that flexibility here again, recognizing we understand code, we understand noise ordinance, we understand and respect the neighbors, and we will not be doing the 12 o'clock, 1145. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8419.765s">It</a>  will not be creeped. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8421.146s">If</a>  that happens, we'll be the first to cut back on it.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8424.257s">And</a>  you realize this is a special permit, so even the fact that you understand code and noise ordinances, you're asking to work outside of the operating parameters of the current noise ordinances.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8435.749s">What</a>  I'm saying is an overlay on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8437.491s">I'm</a>  respectful of what we're saying is. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8440.093s">I</a>  certainly understand that, yes, and I'm not trying to end around the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8444.755s">I'm</a>  recognizing that we understand the rules and regulations just as throughout the construction that we have to abide by, you know, building codes, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8454.34s">The</a>  same thing once we're up and operating. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8456.341s">We</a>  understand and respect, quite frankly, and understand and we will comply. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8461.483s">if</a>  not self-restricted, if there's little missteps, we are the first to react to the positive in reaction to the community, more specifically the town and the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8471.766s">You</a>  have our commitment.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8474.047s">Mr.</a>  President, just if I could, and I know some residents are probably going to want to speak from the Mr. Condos, my support for any special permit tonight, and I just want the gentleman who I respect and <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8488.087s">thank</a>  the business for coming into our community, that my stance is going to remain the same, that the hours of operation for delivery should at the very least coincide with current ordinances and not the extended permit which you're requesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8505.22s">And</a>  if that is something that you can work with and compromise, then as a member of the council, you'll have my vote tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8513.006s">Otherwise,</a>  I think <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8515.648s">At</a>  least from my standpoint, I can't support it.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8518.971s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8519.992s">Mr.</a>  Pierce, you have a store in Chestnut Hill. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8523.014s">We</a>  do. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8524.115s">That</a>  has apartments that are closer than what are here in Midwood. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8528.918s">How</a>  have you dealt with that situation?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8532.961s">Here</a>  again, we're committed as we are in this community to that community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8536.004s">And</a>  it's restricted from midnight to 6 AM.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8539.206s">And</a>  you've had no problems in Chestnut Hill?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8542.189s">That's</a>  my understanding, correct.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8546.641s">If</a>  I can, thank you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8548.922s">I</a>  know in the past this council has looked at different concerns and issues like this and not holding Wegmans back, but could we do a 90 day trial period and move from there to see if that <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8567.4s">In</a>  that 90 days, if those 200 abutters feel that we report back to those neighbors, and if it's something that it has been a distraction, that we re-evaluate.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8581.35s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8586.153s">Councilor</a>  Layton. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8587.094s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8589.855s">This</a>  is a situation that is very similar to the situation we faced at the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8595.262s">where</a>  we had a business that was seeking a special permit that directly abutted a residential property that was multi-family use. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8604.288s">Now,</a>  we have Wegmans, and Wegmans has been a great partner of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8607.11s">I'm</a>  not going to say they haven't been. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8608.371s">Wegmans</a>  has done a great job in redeveloping that parcel and giving it a new, fresh look from that old, tired, and drawn-out look that was the Meadowbrook Mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8617.532s">But</a>  we also have an opportunity this evening to protect the quality of life of 132 residents whose homes face this building and face this street, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8627.136s">I,</a>  for one, am a little concerned about an application for a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8632.258s">And</a>  Wegmans coming here and asking us to offer it when they really haven't been in operation for too long, as it is right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8640.241s">And</a>  the 132 residents that units face this property haven't really gotten the full picture of what it's going to be like when Wegmans is in operation, whether or not the hours of operation is 7 in the morning until 11 at night or 6 in the morning until midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8653.808s">One</a>  of the concerns that I might have is we say, OK, here's your special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8658.59s">You</a>  guys can go until 12 o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8660.251s">And</a>  you can go until 12 o'clock at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8662.372s">Something</a>  I'm not too crazy about at this point in time, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8666.096s">And</a>  what happens is the residents come back and say Wegmans has been in operation now for 180 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8671.701s">And</a>  over the last 180 days, at 9.30 at night, 55 trucks pull up, and they make more noise than we could ever deal with. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8678.027s">We</a>  have the opportunity, because this is a special permit, to put certain restrictions and certain parameters on the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8684.142s">Some</a>  of those restrictions that we could put in would be that signs are posted visibly at the access points that say no loading after certain hours or during certain hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8691.885s">And</a>  those hours could be whatever this council sees fit, whatever this council deems appropriate, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8696.827s">Whereas</a>  this is a special permit, and I believe it's <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8700.108s">Governed</a>  under Chapter 48 of the General Laws, Section 9, we have 90 days to act on the request once it's perfected and comes to our body. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8706.77s">And</a>  I think it might make sense for us to table this matter and wait 90 days and see what happens with Wegmans when they're in operation so that the residents have a better idea of what it is that they're dealing with, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8716.194s">Ultimately,</a>  we're in a situation right now where we have a new, fresh business in the community, and they're a great partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8720.319s">They</a>  are a great partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8721.621s">But</a>  I think that the first job that we have in the City Council, number one, is to keep our streets safe, and number two is to protect the integrity and the quality of life of the taxpaying residents that reside here, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8730.952s">And</a>  I think it's very important for us to recognize the fact that the condo market in the city of Medford is, through the roof, skyrocketing hot right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8738.517s">The</a>  residents in these condominiums pay a ton of money in taxes, as does Wegmans, Mr. President, as does Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8743.68s">But</a>  I think that the residents have to come first. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8746.102s">And</a>  I think that this is something that needs a longer and hotter look, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8749.264s">We</a>  need to determine what the impact is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8751.645s">And</a>  maybe we should look at that impact in the first 90 days of their operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8755.047s">Right</a>  now, we have a permit that's in front of us that's saying, will you let us be open longer? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8759.33s">Why</a>  don't we say, well, think about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8761.171s">Let's</a>  see what happens over the next 90 days, as opposed to putting contingencies and parameters on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8766.173s">Why</a>  don't we see what happens over the next 90 days? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8768.334s">Let</a>  these residents get a taste of what's going on over there, so when they come back to us with their concerns, they have a little bit more of an informed opinion and a little bit more of an understanding of what it's really like, so that they can tell us what it's really like, because none of us live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8780.94s">They</a>  live there every day, and they're the ones that are going to have to deal with this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8784.162s">So,</a>  well, you know, the partnership in the community is excellent, and we certainly appreciate the fundings that they've donated for the Clippership Connector and so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8791.648s">It's</a>  the people that live in this community that make this community great, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8794.57s">We</a>  need to protect them. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8795.912s">So</a>  my recommended course of action would be tabling this matter for 90 days, as outlined by the general laws, which is well within our scope and authority, and seeing what happens over the next 90 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8806.56s">two</a>  or three months during the regular hours of operation of 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8809.904s">to</a>  11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8811.085s">so</a>  that we can determine whether or not there are additional parameters that need to be put on the special permit outside of the 11 o'clock hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8817.653s">Never</a>  mind granting it until 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8819.135s">Maybe</a>  they come for a special permit and say we want our hours of operation to be x, y, and z. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8823.059s">But</a>  all the residents are very upset that the deliveries that happen at a certain time, during jeopardy, I don't know, for whatever reason, whatever problems that the residents have with deliveries happening, whether the volume is high, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8833.185s">We</a>  have an opportunity to protect these residents, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8835.467s">And</a>  I think that the proper course of action this evening would be to table the matter.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8841.93s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8843.391s">I'd</a>  just be interested in hearing from the residents, if anybody would like to add. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8848.48s">And</a>  they have made concessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8850.021s">Wigmans</a>  has made concessions. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8851.723s">There's</a>  been suggestions on the floor, but I think it's important to hear from those that live there.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8856.887s">Any</a>  residents would like to speak on this matter, please step forward.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8863.492s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8864.773s">Hi,</a>  Bill Barabino. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8865.734s">I</a>  live at Mystic Valley Parkway, 390 Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8870.457s">And</a>  I can say, I joined the, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8874.212s">commerce</a>  there in supporting this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8876.614s">I</a>  think this is gonna be, Wegmans is a beautiful building. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8879.997s">It's</a>  amazing on the outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8881.759s">I</a>  myself and my wife went to the Burlington store just to check it out because we got the Wegmans fever. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8889.026s">And</a>  I met the owner, not the owner, but the store manager, Kevin, he was here a minute ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8897.754s">Very</a>  kind, very, very nice people. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8900.587s">So,</a>  however, I think Wegmans, as it stands right now, as it's set up, it's gonna be damaging, and it's gonna be simply destructive to 39020 Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8916.1s">In</a>  particular, I think what you find is the west-facing side. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8919.964s">And</a>  the reason why is basically, and I have a packet in front of you, I don't know if you've gotten to it, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8926.549s">Essentially</a>  what you have is a 390-20 Mystic Valley Parkway is a very large 11-story, 265 units. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8932.932s">I</a>  know you're familiar with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8934.373s">But</a>  it's large and it's brick. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8936.514s">And</a>  then you have Wegmans and the whole Mystic Valley Parkway Mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8941.577s">And</a>  what that is is also a very large brick building. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8946.299s">Or</a>  it's cement or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8949.22s">What</a>  you have, it develops as an echo chamber, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8952.982s">It's</a>  an echo chamber in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8954.602s">And</a>  in fact, they've even made another road, which has sort of taken out some vegetation as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8961.125s">So</a>  it's probably even slightly even louder than it was. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8964.906s">But</a>  what you have is now an echo chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8967.207s">And</a>  the shipping lanes are in that echo chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8973.068s">So</a>  everything you hear about the trucks is spot on, spot on, everybody who has mentioned that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8978.97s">Yes,</a>  it's a big problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8980.67s">So</a>  the shipping lanes, the reason why this place is defective is because the shipping lanes go right through the back, right in between that echo chamber. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8990.893s">For</a>  example, when something travels in between, it's loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8994.296s">For</a>  example, trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8995.517s">Trucks</a>  have to go through there, they go through there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8997.479s">Trucks</a>  are loud for all the reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=8999.281s">The</a>  gate drops, the doors shut, and the engines, the brakes go. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9007.168s">But</a>  the biggest thing, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9009.745s">The</a>  biggest thing is when the reverse lights go on. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9013.907s">So</a>  as you're probably well aware, and it's probably come up before, the reverse alarms, when a truck, any truck reverses, the alarms go off. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9022.87s">It's</a>  federal law. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9023.55s">They</a>  have to have those alarms. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9024.951s">They</a>  make a loud noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9029.254s">Those</a>  alarms that you hear, first of all, at night, it's dead quiet there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9034.64s">At</a>  night, you don't even hear the traffic unless you're up front. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9037.824s">But</a>  in that echo chamber, you hear those alarms. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9041.487s">And</a>  those alarms, those reverse alarms, most pungent, those are at about between 97 and 112 decibels. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9051.112s">That's</a>  how loud they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9052.193s">That's</a>  basically the study show. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9055.756s">97</a>  between 112. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9056.416s">Now,</a>  to give you an example of decibels, a turboprop airplane taking off at 200 feet away is 118 decibels on takeoff. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9069.927s">So</a>  it's that explosive, that noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9072.93s">And</a>  I don't think that's taking into consideration the echo. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9075.952s">Now,</a>  what happens when those alarms go off? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9080.035s">I</a>  wake up. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9081.056s">And</a>  so when I wake up, I can't sleep, or I at least get up for a period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9085.68s">And</a>  then when I get up, if I can't sleep there, then the whole purpose of my home is no longer there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9093.607s">And</a>  what I have is now, I own a piece of brick, and I own some sheetrock in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9098.691s">I</a>  don't own a home, because I can't live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9101.447s">Fortunately,</a>  for me, and I think for some of the people here, is I know that the city council, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9111.063s">can</a>  protect my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9113.184s">And</a>  I know I can possibly have a partner here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9116.606s">And</a>  that is because in 2014, I came before the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9120.588s">I</a>  just happened to be here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9122.089s">It</a>  was exactly the same issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9123.73s">It</a>  was a special permit in Kohl's. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9126.592s">Kohl's,</a>  because of the special permit, and you could put conditions on it, I simply came up and said, you know, there's a couple trucks and the reverse alarms. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9135.757s">And</a>  because I think Kohl's at the time, they wanted just to operate 24 hours a day. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9141.065s">And</a>  that's essentially what Wegmans is to us, because I think the most part, if it's during any time you're sleeping, forget it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9147.286s">But</a>  what they want in 2014 is just to operate six days, 24 hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9153.728s">And</a>  right here, right at the podium, I was so impressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9156.248s">I</a>  hadn't been in one of these before. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9158.769s">We</a>  solved it right there with the attorney. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9160.469s">And</a>  you guys, ladies and gentlemen, both came in and said, we sat there, went back and forth, and eventually you put a prohibition. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9167.67s">You</a>  said, listen, 11 to seven, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9170.708s">You're</a>  not driving trucks, and you also put some, I think, some police presence and different things, which hadn't even come to my mind, but in the knowledge and wisdom of the board, you addressed it, you protected the community, you protected me. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9187.023s">Now,</a>  fortunately, as Councilor Knight had mentioned, people don't know what's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9194.479s">There's</a>  been construction, the construction has been pretty good, and I've gone out and talked to them, and there's been some missteps, well at least I can tell you, I don't know if they're missteps, but I can tell you at least three events in the last two months that document in my affidavit, and also give you some supporting evidence. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9212.026s">But</a>  I can tell you that, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9216.515s">We</a>  don't really know what's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9217.936s">The</a>  building's up. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9218.916s">It's</a>  nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9219.596s">We</a>  haven't seen a truck, really. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9221.357s">I</a>  mean, you've got some pick up and some that sort of thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9224.098s">We're</a>  not ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9224.818s">So</a>  I know you've saved certainly my family. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9231.721s">And</a>  I think it's going to be a lot in 2014. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9233.302s">I</a>  think it's going to be a lot different now. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9238.144s">I'm</a>  asking for three things. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9240.064s">So</a>  I'm asking for three things, and I think that, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9244.618s">we</a>  can coexist with Wegmans, and I think embrace them and have a great welcoming to Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9251.223s">And</a>  those three things are, which have somewhat been mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9254.906s">One</a>  is that you limit the operation of the vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9259.629s">So</a>  that's really, I think, is going to be the operation of the back of Wegmans, the vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9264.793s">So</a>  that's number one, the operation of the back of the vehicles. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9269.116s">When</a>  those alarms go off, I think it's fair, we want, I think you need to get eight hours of sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9273.762s">If</a>  we know that they're gonna, you've acknowledged to me before that they can be bothersome, we're gonna restrict them. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9279.549s">So</a>  we should give at least eight hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9282.871s">So</a>  I'm suggesting, I've talked to the attorney, the morning hours are more important to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9288.713s">Personally,</a>  I get up at 6.30, I don't wanna speak for everyone else, but my sense is, start at 7 or even 6, but let's just get to bed, because you gotta go to sleep to get to work. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9301.077s">And</a>  I know for me, I go to bed at 9.30, and as counsel has mentioned, I'm not sure exactly who, but when we were talking about it before, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9312.33s">I</a>  would be, when they start operating, I would be sitting, waiting, because I go to bed about 9, 30, 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9319.153s">I</a>  would be sitting, waiting for them to stop operations to go to sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9324.155s">That's</a>  what I would be doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9325.576s">So</a>  to think one's rolling in. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9327.637s">Now,</a>  so I said one, the hours of operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9330.238s">Two,</a>  the other thing is they also have 24 hour, they also have 24 hour trash pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9338.141s">Now,</a>  that's an accelerated noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9340.682s">It's</a>  actually as you get the reverse lights. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9342.762s">24</a>  hours, it's minus 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9344.643s">I've</a>  talked to the building department. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9346.743s">The</a>  building department, they're allowed to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9349.004s">That</a>  24, that is a disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9351.104s">438,</a>  I've been out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9352.545s">I</a>  talked to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9353.405s">Apparently,</a>  they're allowed to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9355.586s">And</a>  it just scrapes the metal right off. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9357.606s">I</a>  mean, there's nothing else to do but go over there because I'm awake. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9362.113s">Now,</a>  I've talked to Kevin, and this is an important point, and I think he's mentioned it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9368.936s">The</a>  question is, we want to partner with web, because we don't want to interfere with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9372.378s">I</a>  can tell, and I know, Mr. President, you were very supportive and you've been very communicative. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9378.22s">You've</a>  answered as best as you can all my concerns, and everybody has, and I acknowledge that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9384.363s">I</a>  have not been ignored by anybody, and I thank you for that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9389.626s">The</a>  last thing I have is oversight because whatever restriction you have that restriction has to be like that is it and you don't get in and I feel bad for some person driving from Maine. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9403.847s">We</a>  need to know that that's it, that's bedtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9406.93s">That's</a>  the rules, that's bedtime. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9408.512s">My</a>  suggestion, six, seven, whatever it is they start, but let us get to bed, and you have to give us eight hours of sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9418.203s">Now,</a>  the only thing I mentioned, and I'm gonna close is, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9421.747s">I've</a>  spoke to, in terms of controlling deliveries, I took time off of my schedule, and I went to the alcohol meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9429.831s">And</a>  now the question was, they wanted special permits. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9432.412s">Now,</a>  I listened to the questions, and it was very probing questions of all the councils. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9438.114s">They're</a>  going to have end caps. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9439.315s">They're</a>  going to sell alcohol at the end. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9441.556s">They're</a>  going to have, I think, something like 10,000 square feet.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9446.453s">That</a>  is a separate commission that doesn't fall under our purview.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_08]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9450.017s">And</a>  I'm going to close right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9452.62s">I</a>  would just say that at that meeting, you were very generous with your time there and you were now. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9460.59s">But</a>  I would just close with <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9463.766s">I</a>  met with, I didn't object, and I conditioned my objection solely on deliveries. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9471.571s">And</a>  when Kevin gave me his card, which is in your packet, he told me, we control deliveries. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9478.936s">It's</a>  not an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9480.157s">I</a>  spoke to the attorney, I spoke to Kevin. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9482.478s">It</a>  made me feel good. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9483.899s">And</a>  it also, additionally, it also is reinforced by the fact that <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9491.209s">They</a>  come all the way from Maine. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9492.99s">So</a>  I think it's really scheduled, but really I just want to, um, you know, be able to go to sleep on time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9500.394s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9500.854s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9502.975s">Anyone</a>  else? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9503.475s">Let's</a>  speak.</p>

    <p>[John Costas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9505.476s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9507.818s">John</a>  Costas, 25 Salem street. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9509.979s">Um,</a>  past president of the chamber of commerce, current board member of the chamber of commerce, but I'm not speaking here for the chamber of commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9517.903s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9519.326s">Wegmans</a>  is a huge operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9523.149s">We</a>  all enjoy large operations in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9527.793s">The</a>  property tax they're paying, and what they're going to do financially for the city at twice the residential, I mean, what is the answer? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9538.601s">In</a>  other words, why did we allow Wegmans to build all the Meadow Glen Mall? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9543.365s">When</a>  Meadow Glen Mall went out of business, we should have said, tear it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9548.125s">There's</a>  residential condos, no matter what we do, unless we put a tiny modern pub store there, you shouldn't have Wegmans there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9556.968s">However,</a>  we had Meadow Glen Mall for 35 years there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9562.75s">I</a>  understand there's noises, but for the people that are gonna complain about the noises at 1130 at night, you're gonna have people that work nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9572.694s">They're</a>  gonna complain, I don't want you unloading your trucks, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9576.612s">11</a>  o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9578.034s">I</a>  gotta sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9579.415s">I</a>  work nights again. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9582.238s">What</a>  are you gonna do? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9583.739s">It's</a>  a big operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9585.601s">They</a>  can't be accommodating every single little rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9589.104s">And</a>  if the city and the residents have issues with these corporations, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9593.452s">then</a>  do not allow any large corporations to open up in this city anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9599.376s">If</a>  you're not a tiny operation, you're not going to sell alcohol, you're not going to have tractor-trailers, you're welcome in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9607.281s">But</a>  if you're a big company that's going to generate a thousand jobs, get lost. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9612.645s">We</a>  don't want you here because you're too close to residential condos or apartments or whatever. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9618.93s">Case</a>  in point, the doggy daycare thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9621.552s">So</a>  what is the answer when you get residential next to commercial industrial property? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9626.556s">I</a>  mean, we can't keep coming and complaining and saying, listen, I don't want this business here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9632.821s">I</a>  can't sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9633.501s">I</a>  don't want this business here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9635.723s">Again,</a>  we should not have let them open if everybody's going to complain about their operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9641.963s">I</a>  mean, they have good neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9645.184s">They're</a>  going to generate all this revenue for us, all this job opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9650.467s">What</a>  else is the answer to them? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9652.427s">I</a>  mean, let's not make business difficult for business to survive in this community and put a whole lot of restrictions on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9660.791s">Try</a>  to find an answer, but they're good people. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9663.912s">And</a>  I think they have a lot to offer this community in addition to twice the property</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9677.877s">Good</a>  evening, name and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_23]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9679.637s">Hi,</a>  Tina Caruso, Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9682.938s">I</a>  am the president of the chamber, and I'm representing the Chamber of Commerce. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9687.619s">And</a>  I just want to take a moment of your time just to give you our view on the support for Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9695.321s">Since</a>  the announcement of Wegmans coming to Medford, they have generously donated to many local organizations and events. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9703.843s">And</a>  it's all throughout the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9706.078s">but</a>  also they're present. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9708.499s">They</a>  don't just write a check and walk away. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9710.799s">They</a>  show up. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9713.92s">By</a>  changing the work hours, they're meeting the needs of our community, the part of the community that has to be in work super early and those that work very late. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9725.823s">They're</a>  also hiring locally, part-time as well as full-time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9731.664s">Think</a>  of the effect that that extra one hour <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9735.913s">can</a>  have on one part-time employee, it's about $3,000 a year. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9741.638s">And</a>  I think of my daughter and I say, oh boy, she could really use that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9748.304s">All</a>  these types of things, along with the other things that have already been said, are helping our local economy in Medven. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9758.738s">As</a>  a strong contributor to the economic climate in our city, it would be beneficial to support Wegmans in their request. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9767.366s">Thank</a>  you so much for your time.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9769.208s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[I5lIrWN8Vh8_SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9772.611s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9774.608s">Donovan</a>  Kamara, Chamber of Commerce, Co-Chair of the Governmental Affairs Committee for the Chamber, and a very happy resident of the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9783.694s">Actually,</a>  before I make the comments about Whitewater, I'd like to say how happy I am to return to Medford High School after 33 glorious years of having taught the likes of George Scarpelli and Adam Knight at this wonderful high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9797.162s">So</a>  it's nice to be back. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9798.302s">I</a>  feel at home. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9800.757s">I</a>  would like to strongly echo everything that Madam President of the Chamber just said and John Costas, although I am extremely empathetic that the gentleman spoke just before them. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9811.57s">I</a>  think it's important to get a good night's sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9814.834s">I</a>  think it's important for me. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9816.396s">I</a>  live on Lawrence Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9817.998s">And</a>  on any given morning from, let's say, September to June, I hear nothing but beep, beep, beep, because this high school has cursed me for the past 40 years that I've been living there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9827.703s">Why?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9827.923s">Because</a>  they have to get to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9829.744s">And</a>  it's a hell of a noise out there in the morning for 10 months out of the year. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9833.705s">But</a>  I chose to live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9835.386s">I</a>  love where I live. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9836.567s">The</a>  woods are in the back, so it's quiet in the back, but lots of noise in the front. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9840.229s">So</a>  I accommodated myself to having lived there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9842.249s">I</a>  made a choice. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9843.849s">I</a>  also made a choice not to buy a condo in that particular complex years ago. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9847.734s">I</a>  could have when Murata first built it, you know. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9850.598s">And</a>  it's one of the busiest parkways in the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9854.092s">So</a>  that's a choice that we make, or we don't make. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9857.194s">But</a>  I feel bad. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9857.995s">I</a>  feel bad for the gentleman who says he wants to go to sleep at 9.30 at night or get a good night's sleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9862.198s">I</a>  do not. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9863.018s">So</a>  I would be strongly in favor, I am, as a member of the chamber and everything else, for their extended hours, assuming, of course, that some arrangements can be made, accommodations between the council, the neighbors, who should be respected, of course, and, naturally, the wakeman's itself. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9880.431s">It's</a>  a great institution. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9881.992s">I</a>  can't wait to go shopping there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9884.013s">I</a>  mean, we've got Bar Food Store in South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9886.476s">I</a>  love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9887.276s">We've</a>  got Whole Foods in the back, and now we have Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9890.139s">How</a>  lucky can this town get? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9892.101s">It's</a>  a beautiful, beautiful combination, and I'm happy that they're here, and I hope that a resolution that is happy to the neighbors and Wegmans and the council and everybody that wants to show up there is reached. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9902.712s">So</a>  I am strongly in favor of the extended hours.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9905.274s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9909.226s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[I5lIrWN8Vh8_SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9911.006s">Charlotte</a>  Scuderi, 283 High Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9914.667s">First</a>  of all, I want to say I'm happy to have Whitemans in our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9919.128s">They</a>  have an excellent reputation wherever they have come up. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9923.349s">And</a>  I think that extra hour isn't going to bother anybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9927.15s">I</a>  live on High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9928.33s">My</a>  trash gets picked up at 6 o'clock in the morning, and there's a lot of noise with the trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9933.631s">I</a>  chose to live there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9937.208s">I</a>  don't believe they're going to be having trash removed all day, all night. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9940.489s">That's</a>  not happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9941.929s">As</a>  far as the liquor, that's not happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9943.87s">The</a>  trucks coming in, delivering, I know they'll find an answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9948.471s">I</a>  think we should move ahead, give them the opportunity to show us what they can do. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9953.972s">And</a>  if there's a problem, address it after, not now. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9957.473s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9958.233s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9963.385s">Good</a>  evening.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_38]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9964.226s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9966.627s">Brice</a>  Cipriani, 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9968.388s">I'd</a>  like to start by saying thank you again for having us here this evening, and thanks to everyone that came out to speak on this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9977.934s">A</a>  lot of the items that I had in my notes were already addressed, so without risking repeating a lot of things, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9986.77s">Comments</a>  will be briefer than what I originally thought. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9989.571s">But</a>  it's also important for me to say that I think we all agree that we're welcoming white men into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=9996.514s">I</a>  also, and my family, also frequents the Burlington location. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10002.117s">And</a>  to have a location right next door within walking distance, we're thrilled about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10010.68s">I</a>  personally, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10013.612s">I</a>  am not in favor of the extended hours, but I want to be very specific that this is pertaining to the delivery, not the hours of operation of the store or what's going on in the front of the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10027.185s">We're</a>  fine with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10028.706s">But,</a>  again, that's my personal opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10031.547s">As</a>  a member of the Board of Trustees of the Condo Association, I have an obligation and a responsibility to the unit owners and address any concerns that they have. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10042.351s">So</a>  it's a balancing act. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10044.251s">We</a>  want to make sure that we're being good neighbors, welcoming Whiteman's into the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10050.013s">But</a>  we do have the concerns, again, specifically what's going on in the rear of the store. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10055.115s">As</a>  far as the hours of operation, store hours, that's fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10064.801s">In</a>  talking with some of the residents this evening, I think that we would be open. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10072.103s">to</a>  possibly considering a review and maybe readdressing the issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10078.169s">I</a>  will say one thing, that this morning, by coincidence, at 3.04 a.m., a truck pulled in to the back of Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10087.714s">and</a>  made a delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10089.815s">So</a>  I think that Wegmans should already be taking control of this, not once the store has this grand opening. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10096.318s">I</a>  think from the time that the shovel was put in the ground up until whenever they're gonna be in control of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10103.582s">And</a>  so 3 or 4 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10105.522s">I</a>  made a note of the time and I got up to see that truck making a delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10114.685s">even</a>  if we do allow a certain amount of time or a time window from seven in the morning, eight in the morning, nine in the morning until 10 o'clock at night, what is gonna happen? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10130.891s">Are</a>  those hours going to be extended because of unforeseen circumstances? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10135.813s">Are</a>  we gonna have trucks coming in earlier than the time that we do agree on, trucks staying later? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10143.107s">than</a>  the time we agree on. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10145.368s">So</a>  in wrapping everything up, I think that we would like to find a balance and we're not, we're not against having a review period and confirming that everything will be in line. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10160.113s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10160.813s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10163.174s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10163.634s">President</a>  Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10164.974s">Maybe</a>  we could get addressed the trash pickup.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_12]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10173.663s">Good</a>  evening, Elaine Mastracola, 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10178.185s">I</a>  live on the 9th floor, Overlooking Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10181.346s">I'm</a>  delighted that they're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10183.667s">I</a>  was thinking of going for a job. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10186.008s">I</a>  don't know if they hire old ladies, but I'm delighted they're there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10191.744s">But</a>  I respectfully submit that I would request we keep the status quo with the hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10199.231s">And</a>  if Wayman really cares about community, they will adhere to the 7 to 11 as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10204.455s">Thank</a>  you very much.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10215.034s">First,</a>  I'd like to express our appreciation for all the accolades from the various individuals that just came up before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10222.817s">As</a>  far as Ms. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10224.518s">Councilwoman,</a>  I'd be glad to address a number of the questions that were raised beyond the trash collection, if you'd like, but starting specifically that we do not have overnight pickup of refugees at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10236.922s">Great.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10237.342s">And</a>  I'd be glad to go down and support it from my best recall of the trustee.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10242.167s">I'm</a>  sorry, maybe not a pickup, but do they have a compactor that works?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10247.451s">Our</a>  compactor is up against the building and enclosed what we feed it from the inside of the store.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10253.377s">So</a>  there is no noise.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10254.237s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10254.838s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10255.178s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10256.499s">And</a>  once again, Mr. President, if you'd like, I can go down the list the best I can recall of the number of comments and questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10263.125s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10265.363s">So</a>  we just answered the refuge. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10266.705s">There</a>  is no overnight refuge or pickup. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10270.469s">As</a>  far as the security, we do have, in fact, a very intensive security staff supplemented by the police. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10280.882s">local</a>  police department that are in this and partial on the site for Wegmans specifically from 4 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10287.489s">to</a>  midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10288.15s">So</a>  here again and one just one other factor where Wegmans is helping the community out in the area of security well beyond just being here as a good neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10301.723s">In</a>  addition to that <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10306.376s">The</a>  backup alarms. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10307.637s">I</a>  mean, there is technology out there that you have more of a swish thing rather than the high audible that was referred to. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10314.181s">That's</a>  something that we can certainly look into. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10316.623s">And</a>  if it's available, which I believe the technology there, we can incorporate that into our program. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10323.997s">As</a>  far as condo values, our experience is, whether we're there before or after, when people know there's a wetness, the property values typically are increased. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10334.844s">We've</a>  never had any indication in the 93 stores we have that there's been a decrease in the values of real estate, more specifically residential, against us. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10344.471s">In</a>  fact, we've had places that we've been building, the condos came up after the fact, and they jumped in price, realizing that road use is coming into place. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10354.146s">As</a>  far as the use, obviously, we're a special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10358.287s">We</a>  understand that in an industrialized zone, a more intensive use than is technically permitted on this parcel. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10364.349s">We</a>  ask that that be a very key consideration in this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10371.432s">We</a>  need to remain competitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10379.594s">As</a>  you've probably read in the papers, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10382.383s">The</a>  grocery business is becoming more and more competitive for a number of reasons. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10387.505s">And</a>  this here is another factor that allows us to remain competitive and remain more flexible. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10392.926s">We've</a>  heard all the comments, and we respect very sincerely and deeply the comments made by councilmen and women, as well as the residents about the noise. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10402.089s">And</a>  that's here again, I cannot overemphasize our commitment <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10405.87s">to</a>  be in compliance with code, noise ordinance or otherwise, should there be an issue, we respect and expect and will deal responsibly to the town officials, whether it be here again the council or building inspector, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10424.376s">And</a>  we will have ongoing dialogue with the neighbors and take that into consideration. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10429.425s">The</a>  overall conclusion, though, in all of this, hearing the potential scenarios that were offered by both council as well as citizens, we ask that, at minimal, focusing on the central application, that we have the store open and operating from 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10448.2s">till</a>  midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10448.861s">We</a>  ask that be the key. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10450.962s">Should</a>  there be a desire to have some kind of restriction beyond our self-restriction of no overnight deliveries, then we bring the deliveries from 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10460.373s">to</a>  11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10463.531s">So</a>  this is a consideration for the board out of appreciation to all the comments and not to extend the meeting to the wee hours of the morning for the sake of obviously the council and the citizens. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10476.795s">But</a>  here again, one indication. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10478.535s">But</a>  to remain successful in a competitive market, we need to remain flexible. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10482.776s">We</a>  have to have the hours of operations. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10484.557s">It's</a>  very critical. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10485.837s">And</a>  there's no guarantee that just because we're Wegmans that we're successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10490.358s">Rochester</a>  knows very well the implications of not remaining competitive, not staying ahead of the eight ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10496.622s">Kodak</a>  has come and gone for all practical purposes. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10499.704s">Bauschenlam</a>  is fighting for its life. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10502.326s">Xerox</a>  has been split up. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10504.448s">Here's</a>  the point, you always have to be in front of the game, more ever flexible. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10510.384s">with</a>  respect for the community so you can give back to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10514.488s">There</a>  is no guarantee that we could be here if we're not successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10518.772s">So</a>  it's a benefit to them all, to the community, and certainly to our business. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10522.976s">I'll</a>  be glad to address any of the questions that I haven't been brought up. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10530.313s">As</a>  far as, here again, one other point that the store manager, Kevin Russell, pointed out to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10535.534s">If</a>  a trucker comes there and he's outside the hours or close to the hours, then he should not be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10540.955s">Because</a>  we're going to dictate, if we do have 11 to 12, you cannot come at 10 minutes of 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10547.136s">You</a>  cannot be there a quarter of, et cetera. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10549.857s">You</a>  have to leave the site now, go back to the throwaway, and station it there, wherever that weigh station is, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10556.534s">Number</a>  two, when our trucks come here, our cabs are turned off. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10561.878s">So</a>  that engine is not running. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10563.519s">I</a>  know there's some people who have thought, we've heard, expressed concerns about the cab running. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10568.002s">That</a>  engine is turned off as it comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10570.824s">The</a>  refrigeration units, when they're there, yes, they're on. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10573.525s">But</a>  they are no different than the refrigeration units that are on the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10577.128s">So</a>  in essence, it's the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10579.009s">mechanical</a>  operation that's on the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10581.33s">And</a>  I go back to the initial concern that was expressed by Mr. Councilman about the units on the HVAC units. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10588.171s">I'm</a>  not sure which particular unit that the individual was concerned about or which one the noise emanating has come from. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10595.613s">We</a>  will certainly work with the city, look at it, look at the specs, and if there's a mitigation measure, we would incorporate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10601.454s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10603.525s">Councilor</a>  Falwell. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10604.666s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10605.406s">I'm</a>  just curious. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10606.747s">As</a>  far as when the trucks come to make deliveries, will they be coming all in one direction? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10612.45s">Like,</a>  will they be coming from Locust Street or the parkway? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10615.211s">Which</a>  way would they be approaching the back of the building?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10618.453s">Quite</a>  frankly, I don't know if we have that specific on that, but Kevin might have more details.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10623.93s">Hi,</a>  folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10624.27s">Kevin</a>  Russell, store manager at Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10627.571s">What</a>  I envision, and I'm not a professional truck driver, but looking at the property, I would say the one that makes the most sense would come off Locust and go around the side of Marshalls and come across the back in that direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10639.354s">I'm</a>  not sure if they're on the Mystic Valley Parkway, if they could really turn a right. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10642.995s">It's</a>  pretty sharp. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10644.525s">And</a>  again, I mean, these folks are professionals, and they might be able to get it in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10648.508s">I</a>  couldn't do it, but I think it'll come around the backside. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10651.409s">And</a>  if we say that's the way you have to come, that's the way you come. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10653.631s">I</a>  was the store manager in Burlington, and I don't know if anybody's been up there and seen the third item project, but we said, let's not have trucks come in on first, second, or third. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10661.175s">We'll</a>  come in on fourth. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10662.957s">That</a>  way, they're able to navigate and negotiate much easier, and it's easier on the pavement, too, in an area like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10671.155s">That's</a>  what we do there.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10672.736s">I'm</a>  just thinking if you come around that side of the building, it probably might get a little bit quieter. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10677.577s">But</a>  so thank you for your answer. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10680.458s">Now,</a>  with regard to the compactor, I believe the compactor has some sort of, I think when you hit the button, it starts to compact. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10689.862s">Is</a>  that pretty loud? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10691.042s">I</a>  used to work in a store when I was back in college. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10693.683s">I</a>  knew that seemed to be pretty loud.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10697.042s">I</a>  personally don't believe that it's loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10698.964s">I've</a>  worked with wagons 31 years and used the compactor, I don't even know how many, probably hundreds of thousands of times. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10705.85s">It's</a>  louder on the inside because you're actually there with the mechanics. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10709.433s">When</a>  you hit that button, there's a big ram that pushes out and compacts the garbage. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10714.838s">On</a>  the outside, it's much different. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10717.149s">And</a>  last question.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10719.089s">We</a>  could certainly restrict the hours on that operationally wise.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10725.331s">Yeah,</a>  typically overnight we'll have grocery stocking that takes place and they're really generating cardboard, not waste. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10732.132s">So</a>  that goes inside a bale or inside the building that you wouldn't even know existed from the outside.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10736.593s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10737.894s">And</a>  as far as, actually no, you already answered the question.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10748.285s">Can</a>  you address the gentleman's comment, Mr. Cipriani's comment about the truck coming in at 3.05 this morning?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10757.408s">I'm</a>  not aware of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10758.109s">This</a>  is the first I've heard. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10759.589s">That's</a>  definitely a road tractor trailer. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10763.89s">I'd</a>  be surprised if we don't have a receiver that early in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10769.517s">We're</a>  not up in operation now, so I can't speak to who that was. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10772.678s">I</a>  know we did receive a number of complaints in talking to our construction folks. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10776.72s">We</a>  had received it from a number of the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10779.241s">But</a>  my understanding is those were construction vehicles as part of the overall site construction. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10785.223s">But</a>  I can assure you, again, that there are roads, in this particular case, especially coming down to the line with Petco opening up and Dixon, you know, we're coming down with the wire. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10794.971s">But</a>  that's an anomaly that something that, here again, if we hear something like that, it'll be shut down very quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10801.836s">It'll</a>  be addressed immediately.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_36]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10804.279s">I</a>  also wanted to mention that so the property really isn't turned over to us yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10808.281s">Yes,</a>  it will be us as of November, November 5th. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10810.863s">We'll</a>  run that building. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10812.444s">As</a>  you know, New England Development was the developer. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10815.105s">EMJ</a>  actually runs that construction site may have been something that they ordered in. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10819.708s">But</a>  as Art said, we don't have a receiver on that property until 7 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10824.898s">They</a>  may have had 28 cash registers come in from North Carolina. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10828.761s">They</a>  got here early, thought it was OK to park behind the store, pulled in. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10832.203s">I</a>  don't know if that unit continued to run. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10834.464s">I</a>  know nothing about that delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10835.985s">But</a>  I can guarantee you that if we say we won't have folks after 11 or before 6, it won't happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10843.269s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10847.132s">Further</a>  comments from the audience? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10850.173s">Yes,</a>  you may. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10852.887s">Name</a>  and address of the record.</p>

    <p>[Andrew Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10853.907s">Andrew</a>  Castagnetti, Cushman Street, Method, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10857.569s">Patiently,</a>  I've been listening, and I'd like to offer a few words, knowing that you can never satisfy all the people all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10867.333s">However,</a>  I believe that is still an industrial zone, not residential. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10873.136s">And</a>  also, the old saying goes, competition usually makes better business. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10878.796s">So</a>  the more competition, it would definitely be better for the consumer, I presume, lowering the prices, maybe stopping shop or lower the usury prices. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10889.618s">As</a>  a matter of fact, it might be a great idea to, instead of the 490 unit proposed development across the street, which is tied up in two or three lawsuits, that market basket goes in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10907.072s">and</a>  then we could really lower some prices. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10909.813s">Thank</a>  you for listening.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10911.674s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10920.379s">Come</a>  on down, Frank.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_09]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10923.541s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10924.861s">My</a>  name is Frank Bankey. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10926.302s">I</a>  am a trustee and I happen to be chairman of the board of trustees at 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway, which is the abutting property. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10935.047s">Um,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10937.413s">professor</a>  to speak for everybody in the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10941.856s">Nobody</a>  can. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10942.857s">Nobody</a>  has that authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10944.979s">I'm</a>  here to speak for myself, but I'll say one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10947.781s">I</a>  don't think anybody can dispute the fact that I get around the building probably more than anyone else because I happen to be retired and I know a lot of people and I do speak with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10957.548s">I</a>  can honestly say I have never had anybody say to me <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10961.591s">that</a>  they were against Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10963.632s">Welcome</a>  them with open arms. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10965.012s">We're</a>  excited to get them. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10966.773s">But</a>  there are some concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10969.154s">And</a>  some of those concerns would affect me because I am on the side that abuts the back of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10976.856s">Now</a>  today, the Honorable President of the Board made reference that one of the members of the Board of Trustees met with people from Wegmans, and that happened to be me. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10989.896s">We</a>  did have, I thought, a very productive meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=10994.78s">Many</a>  of the things, like we've heard about the great contributions that Wegmans has made to the community at large, but I'll tell you, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11002.25s">They</a>  were more than happy to support a resolution that the president of this city council is going to propose at the next meeting that I'm asking for his support. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11013.693s">And</a>  that is, I think the people who live in our building can appreciate the poor condition of the sidewalk in front of our building. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11021.895s">It's</a>  particularly that section that leads from our driveway over to Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11028.724s">There's</a>  a lack of adequate lighting, and the trees are overhanging. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11034.025s">Now,</a>  I today contacted the office of Senator Pat Jalen, who I've known for a long time, and I said that I would like to get some support from the local community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11043.927s">And</a>  your president, Timothy Boyd, jumped right on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11046.328s">He</a>  said, be glad to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11047.448s">I'll</a>  sponsor it for you at the next meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11049.608s">And</a>  the people from Wegmans, when I spoke with them, glad to do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11054.707s">That's</a>  what we want to be, is we want to be good neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11057.27s">We</a>  want it to be a two-way street. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11058.932s">We</a>  want to be able to go over and speak with the people there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11062.676s">A</a>  couple of other issues that came up. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11066.881s">You</a>  people are going to have, when I say you people, I mean Wegmans, is going to have 24-hour security. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11072.847s">Now</a>  that bolsters our security. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11076.131s">First</a>  day I took office as the chairman, I ordered the security guards at nighttime to make rounds of the building so that we have increased visibility with the security people. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11087.983s">And</a>  now if we have the, I understand that the people from <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11093.165s">Brinkman's</a>  are going to be outside as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11095.406s">So</a>  that gives us another degree of security. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11097.666s">I</a>  think at least on that side of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11100.587s">There</a>  have been some pretty good issues here raised tonight about the picking up of trash, and it is loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11105.008s">It</a>  is loud. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11106.889s">And</a>  I'm talking about the compressor that we have on our own property. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11110.51s">Certainly</a>  something can be done to probably abate that, whether there's some kind of muffler systems or whether <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11118.27s">We</a>  could have scheduled pickups during normal business hours, not through the night. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11122.254s">I</a>  understand that these types of things, according to the law, they're able to come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11127.219s">I</a>  know in Somerville that they have problems with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11129.561s">They</a>  can come in commercial people and empty dumpsters at all times of the day and night. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11136.788s">I</a>  came here tonight with the <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11139.765s">you</a>  know, expectation that you people were going to vote on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11143.706s">I</a>  have no problem with going with the normal scheduled hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11147.526s">I</a>  heard Councilor Knight come up with what I thought was a pretty good proposal and that was to put it on, I don't know if the correct term was to put it on the table or hold it in abeyance for a period of time so that if there are particular complaints, certainly people in my building are not bashful about expressing their complaints. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11166.796s">They</a>  would contact either, hopefully they would let us know on the board, but they would also contact Wegmans as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11174.339s">But</a>  I'm one person who is extremely excited and grateful to have this new business coming into our neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11182.561s">They've</a>  done a heck of a job on the front of that building, and when you think of what's left there, no disparaging Kohl's, but the way the brick and mortar stores are going, I don't know how much longer Kohl's is gonna last. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11193.365s">And</a>  if that falls under, and we didn't do anything about bringing white men in, we'd have a dust bowl over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11199.087s">We'd</a>  probably have cops down there all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11201.568s">Speaking</a>  of which, and I worked for the Somerville police for 28 years, if ever there was a violation of any kind that somebody suspects <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11212.232s">they</a>  should call the police, and the police will come down and stop the delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11217.175s">And</a>  also, when the police department responds to a call, they are required to keep a record of that call, so that if we came back in 30 days or 90 days, it's very simple to go down to the police station, any one of us, and ask for a copy of the calls that were received by the police for the response they had to May 39, to, wait, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11241.397s">So</a>  I don't want to be here and frustrate Wegmans from coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11246.183s">I</a>  think everybody here really is for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11248.627s">And</a>  I think with your cooperation, your guidance, I'm sure we can have a great relationship with them. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11254.855s">I</a>  know that I've spoken with them today. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11256.417s">They're</a>  going to do some. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11259.037s">shrubbery</a>  work for us, and they're going to help us out with some property concerns that we have. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11264.925s">Again,</a>  I'm excited about getting this front sidewalk fixed, and the trees trimmed, and adequate lighting, and it's going to be safe for people to go back and forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11274.759s">And</a>  in closing, I do want to thank you very much, Mr. President, and the honorable members of the board for allowing us to come here this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11283.781s">A</a>  little tough there during the beginning day, you know, with the long hearings there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11289.163s">But</a>  this was productive. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11290.683s">It</a>  was worth the wait. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11291.403s">But</a>  thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11293.624s">I</a>  was in this business. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11294.844s">I</a>  know how boring that is.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11305.733s">Mr.</a>  President, Council Members, if I might. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11308.195s">So</a>  we've heard a lot tonight from obviously the Council and the neighbors. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11314.02s">Here</a>  again, back to the original application asking for hours of operations 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11318.684s">to</a>  midnight. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11319.285s">We</a>  ask that that <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11321.137s">We</a>  voted on with consideration that we will not only self-restrict overnight, but if the board chooses to restrict deliveries between 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11331.606s">and</a>  6 p.m., that we feel <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11338.954s">We</a>  feel that that is a situation where it's very clear in its cast in stone where we heard the resonance, we respected the resonance primarily at the end of the night, end of the day, if you will. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11353.217s">Albeit</a>  it restricts us, and Corey Frank, I'll tell you the challenge is now here again, and not to belabor it, with the weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11358.54s">Ideally,</a>  we'd get both together with hours of operations, 6 to midnight, and deliveries, because the weather, and it's not something that I fabricate this, but we feel it's going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11369.745s">Possibly</a>  with the weather and traffic and then we don't want the frustration with the neighbors the council and certainly else but with that said We'd appreciate an offer if they would 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11380.273s">To</a>  midnight for hours of operation and then concurrent with that restrict of deliveries of tractor trailers in the back from 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11387.358s">Till</a>  6 a.m</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11390.32s">Councilor</a>  Layton.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11391.541s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11393.222s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11394.443s">Sir,</a>  can you please explain to me a little bit more about what Mr. Bakey was discussing, some of these contingencies and some of these commitments that you've made to the Condo Association over there, so we have a better understanding?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11404.851s">Yeah,</a>  I'll have to defer to Mr. Dugney. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11406.793s">I</a>  believe he's referring to site improvements, that New England development. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11409.955s">That's,</a>  once again, it's a tenant, so that was New England development.</p>

    <p>[Brian Dugdale]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11420.106s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11422.168s">Again,</a>  Brian Dugdale from Goulston Stores. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11426.051s">There</a>  were commitments that have been made. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11428.914s">I</a>  think we went through a lot of them previously in terms of there will be sealed loading docks. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11434.158s">In</a>  terms of the landscape offer, there will be additional planting that's done between <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11439.266s">the</a>  mall property and the condo property, as well as a fence that's going to gate off. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11444.829s">There's</a>  a, I don't want to get too lost in the weeds, but there's a driveway that leads right in between the two properties and there's an entrance. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11451.393s">That's</a>  going to be gated off to ensure that there'll be no truck access from the condo side. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11456.616s">Everything</a>  will be coming through the mall property. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11459.717s">We've</a>  agreed to give additional funding. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11461.138s">The</a>  amount's still to be determined, but that funding's going to be used to plant an additional layer of shrubs, buffer-type landscaping improvements on the condo side of the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11471.422s">In</a>  terms of security, I'm not sure that exactly it's going to be 24-hour security, but there is going to be security both through Wegmans and the mall. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11478.386s">There's</a>  going to be two layers of security, and there will be monitoring, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11482.447s">And</a>  Wegmans, correct me if I'm wrong, but 24-7 with cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11486.489s">And</a>  again, the other commitment, the two other commitments that were discussed, there will be a designated representative, so it's going to be very easy to get in touch with both the ownership of the mall as well as Wegmans to address any of these issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11498.934s">And</a>  then the other thing that we were talking about earlier is just the condition of the sidewalk. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11503.715s">Mr.</a>  Bakey was referring to. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11505.276s">It's</a>  along Mystic Valley Parkway, which unfortunately is owned by the Department of Conservation and Recreation. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11510.92s">So</a>  we don't have the ability to actually do those improvements, but we would be more than happy to support any sort of a resolution of this council or any actions taken by Mr. Bakey himself to try to get some sort of funding and attention on that matter.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11527.653s">The</a>  reason I ask, Mr. Dungill, is because I think that based upon what we're hearing from the residents, that they want to be a good neighbor. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11535.015s">They</a>  want to be a partner with Wegmans. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11537.096s">And</a>  I think they realize that Wegmans is going to be there for a long time, provided that they have tools to be successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11545.678s">Concessions</a>  that have been made, I think, are very important to gaining the support of the residents of 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway and their efforts to be in favor of extended hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11556.104s">And</a>  I was hoping maybe that we could get these criteria outlined so that we could include them as conditions in the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11563.348s">Because</a>  the way that I'm looking at it, I think, is that people don't seem to have too much concern over the front of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11568.811s">They're</a>  not too worried about the hours of operation being 6 o'clock in the morning till midnight in the front of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11573.274s">The</a>  concerns are really on the loading in the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11575.575s">And,</a>  you know, the request that's before us this evening is to allow a 6 to 12 operation in the front of the house and allow a 6 to 11 o'clock at night operation in the back of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11585.222s">I,</a>  for one, am a little bit more comfortable with the status quo operation in the back of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11590.961s">and</a>  with the 6 to 12 operation in the front of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11593.922s">But</a>  I think it would be very important that we get these criteria included. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11596.743s">I'd</a>  make the motion, Mr. President, to support the special permit, provided that there are restrictions that are placed upon it, one of them being that these special conditions and concessions that have been made by the developer and the condominium association are included as an addendum to the special permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11616.528s">that</a>  the hours are restricted for deliveries from status quo 7 to 11 in the back, and that we allow the permit to go forward for 6 to 12 in the front for the operations of the house, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11626.655s">I</a>  also have a concern about the permit being issued in perpetuity, and I think that there should be a review placed on it, and I also think that the permit should go with the petitioner and not the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11638.423s">So</a>  those are some of the concerns that I have, and I think that with these parameters, I'd be comfortable voting for this.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11649.266s">I</a>  think they're more concerned, it's probably the beginning hours more than the back hours for deliveries. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11655.615s">Because</a>  most of their break and things like that are all coming in the morning versus in the afternoon. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11661.844s">So</a>  I think they're concerned it's more of the. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11665.288s">The</a>  front of the hour versus the back of the hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11669.852s">I</a>  don't know if they want to address that.</p>

    <p>[Brian Dugdale]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11672.635s">Mr.</a>  President, I don't want to speak for Whiteman's, but just to be clear, we're happy to accommodate any of those conditions as part of the condition of the special permit, with that exception. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11681.142s">I</a>  think, again, I don't want to speak for Whiteman's, but I think I heard that 6 to 11 is what their request is now in terms of limiting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11687.368s">Mr.</a>  President?</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11692.047s">Could</a>  just a point of clarifications on Councilor Knights, if I may, Mr. President and Chair, to Councilor Knights' summation. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11702.61s">Now,</a>  I understood from the speakers and from the representatives of Westman that there seems to be a consensus that people would be all right with six to 11 in the back of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11716.273s">And</a>  your suggestion was that</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11721.557s">remains</a>  status quo.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11722.237s">That</a>  we have a review, that your suggestion is status quo, that we have a review, yes?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11729.221s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11729.941s">At</a>  what point?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11731.162s">30</a>  days.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11731.482s">30</a>  days. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11732.562s">30</a>  days. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11733.723s">And</a>  that we have, that it's tied only to weapons.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11740.006s">Only</a>  to weapons.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11740.466s">And</a>  not to the property.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11741.347s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11743.692s">Do</a>  I have those three points?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11745.033s">Those</a>  three points are correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11746.094s">Hours</a>  6 to 12 in the front of the house, 7 to 11 in the back of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11748.956s">The</a>  permit goes with the petitioner and not with the property. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11751.478s">And</a>  then the criteria that have been outlined and agreed upon between the two parties would be attached as an addendum to the special permit so that we know what's expected.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11758.303s">And</a>  the 30-day review?</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11760.144s">The</a>  30-day review, provided there's no problems with the deliveries. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11762.866s">Maybe</a>  we can look at extending the hours of deliveries and the hours of operation in the back of the house, provided that there's no problems from the deliveries during the status quo hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11772.873s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11774.054s">Thank</a>  you for your time.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11775.476s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11776.296s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11776.657s">I</a>  just also like it noted on the as a condition to make sure there's no trash pickup in the back during the evening hours, the night hours from at least 11 to 6 in the morning.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11789.877s">You</a>  would want to address that to the developer, because there are four other companies besides Wegmans that pick up trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11798.724s">Wegmans</a>  is saying that they will not have any trash pick up. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11801.726s">Again,</a>  that doesn't address the Dicks, Marshalls, Coles.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11805.168s">They're</a>  not before us right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11806.149s">Wegmans</a>  is before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11806.95s">I</a>  know, but Wegmans has said they will not have any trash pick up. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11809.271s">I</a>  don't know if we can make that a condition to make sure that stays that way.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11816.775s">And</a>  Mr. President, if I might, back to the 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11819.137s">hours</a>  of operation to midnight hours of operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11821.739s">We</a>  still, once again, request that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11824.22s">And</a>  then back to the deliveries, to the point of being freshness here again. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11827.943s">We're</a>  trying to get product, fresh product there, out there before our customers come in. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11833.387s">And</a>  that extra hour goes a long way to allow us to get a private. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11837.63s">And</a>  I think it was made mention that my ears heard, because I think some counsel <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11841.753s">folks</a>  that the residents seem to support the 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11845.595s">They</a>  definitely did not like the evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11848.337s">We</a>  heard that very loud and clear, not speaking for each and every one of the residents, but I thought that's what I heard and it's on record. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11855.881s">So</a>  we ask that that be modified for consideration of a 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11860.723s">to</a>  11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11861.884s">for</a>  the deliveries.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11865.126s">Through</a>  the chair, would you be willing to go to 10 p.m.? ?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11869.44s">That's</a>  taking a step backwards and really being problematic for operations to put them on. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11874.262s">We</a>  already have had, even last week, I've had conversations with our distribution transportation groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11881.024s">They</a>  are reconsidering all of Massachusetts and all the programs. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11884.225s">That's</a>  how strapped we are with the tight program of 7-Eleven. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11890.326s">That</a>  would be more than problematic. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11894.246s">Vice-President</a>  Moxx.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11895.927s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could, I think the compromise that the gentleman is stating from 6 to 11 is a compromise. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11906.452s">As</a>  Councilor Knight mentioned about putting a 30-day review <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11911.554s">And</a>  I'd like to see maybe a 30-, 60-, or 90-day review. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11913.455s">I'd</a>  like to see them all. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11915.957s">And</a>  then we can take a look at it to talk to the residents of Mr. Condos to see how it's working. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11923.522s">And</a>  the condition is only based on the reviews. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11928.686s">So</a>  if within 30 days, sir, if we get a number of complaints about the trucking and so forth, we can withdraw the extended</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11941.917s">not</a>  overstating my welcome, but any operation up and running, it takes time to get some of the bugs out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11950.899s">We</a>  have truckers coming into the site that haven't been here before. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11956.42s">We'd</a>  ask them further out than 30 days, whether it be 60 or 90, but just from a more practical, up and running sort of thing, versus out of the gate. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11965.462s">Hydrogen</a>  is obviously a here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11968.863s">We're</a>  going at a mile a minute sort of thing, with consideration of that factor, that we're going from zero. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11974.845s">And</a>  I trust you'll find from our other experiences with stores, it'll be very successful, thanks to the community, and hopefully, obviously, our customers, including the condo residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11986.309s">It</a>  will be going 100 miles an hour, all aspects of the operations, internal and external. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11992.472s">So</a>  we ask that, whether it be 60 or 90, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=11996.573s">30-day,</a>  we certainly respect the ultimate goal, but that's, from a very practical point of view, a challenge. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12003.078s">But</a>  at the same time, we're not surrendering at all the recognition that we have to be in compliance.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12009.143s">COPS</a>  on 9. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12011.004s">This</a>  brings me back to my initial point, Mr. President, when I first spoke on the topic. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12014.867s">We</a>  don't know what to expect down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12016.648s">So</a>  now we want to go from 7 to 11 to 6 to 12. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12021.072s">He</a>  just said, so we're going to be going 100 miles an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12023.293s">The</a>  first 30 days, it's probably going to be bumpy.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12025.655s">No,</a>  I didn't say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12026.997s">I</a>  said it's always a challenge and be very realistic. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12031.441s">I</a>  don't think in any kind of event, any kind of exercise, that giving due process consideration of practical time is somebody's up and running. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12042.012s">It's</a>  just a recognition of reality. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12044.935s">We</a>  are very successful in what we do, but I didn't want to have the town get a false read why anomalies without liars. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12053.899s">That's</a>  my point there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12055.079s">And</a>  I think as you give a little beyond 30 to 60, we're not trying to duck away from any responsibilities. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12061.262s">We're</a>  trying to fine tune our machine from day one, and we're not rated number one in the industry because we're <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12071.292s">across</a>  the board, but I think from the practical point of implementation, that's all I'm asking for a little free board there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12078.294s">We</a>  respect everything else that goes with that, and if it's 30 days, it's 30 days. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12082.255s">Certainly,</a>  in the end, we respect it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12084.716s">But</a>  that's all I'm asking for that point of view. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12086.776s">So</a>  if I might, from our point of view, if you could, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12089.737s">Again,</a>  summarizing, I think, what I've said to make sure I'm clear is that 6 to midnight for operations in front, like how you put that, very good. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12098.003s">The</a>  back is 6 to 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12100.185s">And</a>  then we ask, if not, if it's 60 or 90 would be considered. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12105.289s">But</a>  certainly, if 30 is 30, that's what it is.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12107.491s">Well,</a>  why don't we do both, Mr. President? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12108.952s">Because</a>  the residents are going to have to live there for the 30 days, and they're going to have to put up with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12112.734s">So</a>  why don't we bring them in at 30 and at 90? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12114.856s">So</a>  we can see if the kinks have worked out, if any issues are raised within 30 days that may be attributable. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12121.3s">A</a>  30-day review and a 90-day review.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12123.181s">60</a>  and six months. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12124.562s">We</a>  could do that too, but I mean... Let's do three reviews.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12127.264s">I'm</a>  all for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12129.865s">All</a>  for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12131.426s">I</a>  just want the flexibility to be able to address the residents' concerns and not have to wait 60 or 90 days to get them here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_17]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12139.597s">Once</a>  again, our preference is other, but certainly we respect the ultimate vote.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12145.328s">So</a>  I just want to make sure that we have this correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12147.813s">The</a>  front of the house. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12149.072s">will</a>  be able to operate from 6 to midnight, 6 to 12, correct?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12152.395s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12153.175s">And</a>  the rear of the house for the deliveries will be 6 to 11. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=12159.521s">The</a>  review would be on the back of the house would be in the 30 days, another review in 60 days, and a third review in 90 days.</p>
