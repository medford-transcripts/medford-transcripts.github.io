    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2388.348s">Anita</a>  Flater, 5 High Street, United of Massachusetts, 02155.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2391.389s">And</a>  you were the owner, correct?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2394.19s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2394.99s">I'm</a>  the managing director of Ultimate Tango. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2399.115s">We</a>  want to speak in favor of that and we basically want to express or explain the reasons why we need these extra hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2406.757s">So</a>  Argentine tango is not simply just a dance, it's the whole culture that basically teaches people how to behave in public places when there is a dance involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2419.4s">and</a>  also involves different customs and habits of the cultural behavior between lady and the gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2428.004s">So</a>  we have this, besides just teaching simply the tango during our regular classes, we also have these gatherings that are called milonga, where people come and practice their dance, but also meet socially. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2442.551s">So</a>  those gatherings in Boston area are happening every day in different studios. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2449.995s">And</a>  right now the only day that is not occupied is Sunday. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2453.897s">So</a>  our starting day where we would like to use this additional two hours of business being open would be Sunday to start. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2465.844s">We</a>  will not initially use any other day. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2469.446s">So</a>  it will be once a week on Sunday when people will come at 9 o'clock for the special event and stay until 1 o'clock to dance. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2479.654s">Those</a>  milongas have special settings. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2481.836s">It's</a>  the gathering when people can sit, talk between each other. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2487.019s">They</a>  usually come as a couple, husband and wife. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2490.622s">people</a>  who are together, or sometimes come the whole families and they sit together. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2494.425s">There</a>  is a special code of dress, there is a special code of invitation, how to invite lady for dance. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2500.449s">There</a>  is a special code how many dances they dance together. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2503.431s">There</a>  is a lot of different little customs that people who dance tango, they know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2508.695s">And</a>  of course, some of you participated in our opening night, so you're kind of familiar how it looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2515.811s">So</a>  there is no kind of like a wild party settings. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2520.935s">The</a>  music is very mild. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2522.597s">People</a>  behave actually very, very politely. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2524.999s">They</a>  care for the ladies, they care for the partners. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2527.821s">They</a>  walk them in, they walk them to the car, so it's very safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2530.803s">I</a>  explained all that to Mr. Sacco, the chief of police, who had a little doubt and he seemed to be understanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2539.77s">how</a>  it looks like, and we also invited him over, so that's why he now supports our application too. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2546.695s">And</a>  that's pretty much it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2549.437s">Yeah,</a>  this is very much, I mean, one of the reasons also we have the event start by 9pm, because as we say, there are quite a lot of events happening during the week, you know, so this Sunday, there are another two studios who organized <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2564.355s">two</a>  more practicals in different hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2566.336s">If</a>  we don't want to conflict, you know, the business, we want to respect the hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2570.777s">The</a>  only hour we can start it will be like at 9 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2574.138s">And</a>  because we finish also our lessons around 6 p.m., some people coming from New York and from different areas far away, and they want to just go home, maybe with the family, you know, take a shower, get ready for coming back to the party. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2587.081s">Before</a>  they coming back, sometimes, you know, driving 45 minutes, some people driving one hour, and be in the studio just for <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2593.85s">And</a>  also in Argentina the milonga is 24 hours, so people just keep dancing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2598.612s">It's</a>  a kind of ritual. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2600.013s">In</a>  Argentina we dance very much all day long, from 10 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2602.574s">to</a>  6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2602.834s">sometimes,</a>  longer.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2626.355s">We</a>  also believe we will not interfere with anybody because it's a business area and also our music is really mild, like nobody even hear it outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2637.644s">And</a>  since most people drive and there's plenty of parking here and it's a business district, most businesses are already closed, only two restaurants open till 11, then I don't think we're gonna collide with anybody specifically.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2653.738s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2656.024s">Come</a>  through the gate.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2658.427s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2661.109s">I've</a>  reviewed the paperwork and the paperwork appears to be in order. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2665.092s">I've</a>  noticed a couple of concessions that the applicant has made. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2668.314s">Initially,</a>  the request was to stay open till 4 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2671.837s">Sunday</a>  evenings. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2673.338s">Chief</a>  Sacco wasn't too fond of that idea and has approved a restriction of operation till 1 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2679.842s">That's</a>  something that he feels as though he's comfortable with. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2682.765s">Also,</a>  I've noticed that the petitioner has agreed to have the doors locked at 11 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2687.828s">And</a>  no one will be allowed to enter the facility unless they're buzzed in through an intercom system that they have there, which also has a camera capability so that they'll know who's outside the door so that random people won't be wandering in off the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2700.306s">I</a>  do have a question for the petitioners. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2702.008s">Is</a>  there going to be any live music?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2708.087s">No,</a>  there is only going to be recorded music.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2712.171s">Mr.</a>  President, the paperwork is in order and everything appears to be signed off on by other heads in the like. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2718.717s">So</a>  with that being said, I see no reason in the way of this approval.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2722.861s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2724.262s">I</a>  think my first question you answered the sound will be mild, so you won't be able to have sound barriers around your facility.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_00]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2736.639s">Yeah,</a>  the sound of the rectangular is very mild music. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2739.482s">It</a>  doesn't get out. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2741.524s">Even</a>  the restaurant actors or us, we did a check sound with them, and they don't hear nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2747.709s">If</a>  we try to put on the maximum that we could use in it, and it doesn't get out.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2761.318s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2761.778s">And</a>  my second question, if you are going to be open until one and people will be dancing since nine, what are you doing? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2768.862s">What</a>  will there be for food and beverage?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_35]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2775.402s">During</a>  regular milongas we do not provide any food or beverage, just drinking water. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2782.646s">So</a>  no, sometimes, like we had an opening night, we did have a little snack to cheer people up, but normally no, there is no food provided by us, just drinking water.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2794.476s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2810.666s">Economic</a>  Development Committee, which takes care of signs. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2814.688s">We've</a>  worked in several subcommittee meetings with the proprietors of this group quite intimately over the past few months, and I have to say that they've been the most congenial people. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2830.256s">They've</a>  been compliant. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2832.297s">to</a>  any of our requests. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2834.139s">They've</a>  certainly made the effort to, and they have, attended all the meetings when we've scheduled them, which, as we all know, can be cumbersome for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2843.667s">And</a>  so if they're traveling from other towns to come in, they've been great people and <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2851.225s">As</a>  a fellow business person here in Medford, I'm delighted to have them operating in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2860.31s">They'll</a>  bring something new and diverse to us. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2863.412s">It's</a>  something positive and energetic. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2865.914s">And</a>  so I welcome this request and lend my voice of approval to it, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2872.517s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2873.478s">Anyone</a>  else would like to speak in favor of this?</p>

    <p>[I5lIrWN8Vh8_SPEAKER_15]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2877.947s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2878.987s">Once</a>  again, Dominic Camara, Chamber of Commerce, Governmental Affairs Committees. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2883.29s">And</a>  I'd like to say that I was fortunate enough with several other people to have visited the Tango Studio when they first opened it up about roughly a month ago, when they inaugurated and sort of cut the ribbons symbolically, if nothing else. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2897.136s">And</a>  I was very, very enthralled. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2898.997s">I</a>  was very happy to see the operation. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2901.218s">It's</a>  beautiful. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2901.938s">It's</a>  downstairs at 5 High Street, for those of you who may not realize where the <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2906.201s">position</a>  of the place and that's where the old channel three thing used to be and it's very very nice very professional and so on and I gotta tell you with all the tango that was playing and so on and these two can dance oh my god <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2923.819s">And</a>  so when we left, myself and the other two or three guests that we went to visit that night, by the time I got up to the lobby, you couldn't hear a note of the music because it's downstairs, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2933.764s">So</a>  even if it's loud and whatever it is, you're never going to hear anything. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2937.345s">So</a>  disturbance is not an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2938.566s">But</a>  here's the bottom line. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2941.227s">that</a>  you can bring to Medford Square is a desirable thing to have and to wish for. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2946.491s">So</a>  I hope that another store like this opens up and wants to be open until 2 o'clock, let alone 1, you know, when the time comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2952.375s">And</a>  that's pretty much what I have to say. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2954.116s">And</a>  I welcome them in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2956.098s">I</a>  think they're wonderful, professional people, and they're so talented. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2959.1s">And</a>  I have nothing but happiness for them.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2961.622s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2962.602s">And</a>  I for one can say I was there that night that they opened. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2965.184s">I</a>  was very impressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2966.506s">The</a>  men were dressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2967.226s">The</a>  women were dressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2968.607s">The</a>  dancing was outstanding. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2970.209s">And</a>  like Mr. Kamara said, when I went down to the bottom floor there, I could barely hear the music in the hallway. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2977.975s">But</a>  again, she's promised that she can teach me how to tango. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2980.697s">Anybody</a>  can do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2983.298s">But</a>  again, I welcome them. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2985.42s">And</a>  I think the studio was very, very nice. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2988.682s">And</a>  it's very impressive what I saw that night. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2990.523s">If</a>  they weren't dressed, we'd be in trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2992.044s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2992.584s">We</a>  wouldn't give up hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2994.926s">Move</a>  approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=2999.528s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor De La Russa. <a

href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3010.034s">I'll</a>  be down for those dance lessons. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3020.266s">Okay.</a>  <a

Ashland Street will require grinding and inlaying the trench from centerline to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3133.469s">The</a>  trench paving of Salem Street will be asphalt-based

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3270.107s">Okay,</a>  could you please explain your project there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3272.92s">In</a>  this project, we have a request from the Century Bank to provide service. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3276.502s">We're</a>  basically going to be coming out of Ashland Street with two new conduits and trenching down Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3283.905s">Originally,</a>  the Century Bank is the customer, but in doing this project, we'll also be able to provide services to the customers on the odd side of Salem Street in conjunction with service getting down to the Century Bank. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3300.658s">I</a>  did submit yesterday, a little bit late in the afternoon, a preliminary traffic plan for review. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3307.303s">I</a>  don't know if we've had time to review that or not, but if approved, we will work with the city engineer to revise that as needed. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3314.648s">Those</a>  maps?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_21]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3317.37s">Those</a>  full maps?</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3318.191s">I</a>  think everybody has their maps with them.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3325.597s">Mr.</a>  President? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3329.139s">Mr.</a>  President? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3336.793s">I</a>  have a few questions about just the project in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3341.798s">So</a>  if you could just let us know and let people watching at home know, how long do you think this project is going to take?</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3350.586s">That's</a>  going to depend upon the street opening permit and when the work would be allowed if approved. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3357.112s">I</a>  know that's a heavy congested area. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3361.243s">Depending</a>  upon the digging and the amount of utilities, there's a few things based off of the engineer's comments that we're going to need to address prior to the work once we get that taken care of. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3370.891s">I</a>  would say the work would probably take a week, maybe a little bit longer, again, depending upon the digging and the working hours.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3379.338s">And</a>  do you think some of this work will be done at night, or is it mostly to working hours?</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3384.65s">Again,</a>  it all depends on how that, on what the city engineer believe, when they issue the permit, if it's gonna be required night work or day work. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3393.112s">It</a>  may make sense to do it at night and we may be able to get more work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3396.533s">I</a>  just don't know what the working hours would be, what would be approved.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3401.434s">And</a>  could you tell us, let's see. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3407.657s">Basically,</a>  with regard to the sidewalks, you're going to be, I think, ripping up a few sidewalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3412.607s">You're</a>  going to be, can you tell us a little bit about, you know, how many sidewalks you're going to rip up? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3418.13s">You're</a>  going to be replacing them with cements? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3420.492s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3420.932s">And</a>  can you tell us, is it two sidewalks, or do you know how many?</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3426.097s">I</a>  believe there's three vault locations in the sidewalk there, and I think, I believe, I haven't been out there in a while looking at this, but I believe there's at least two panels getting to where the vault locations, so there's roughly around eight panels total that would need to be replaced in kind.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3443.451s">And</a>  they'll be replaced with concrete?</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3445.132s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3446.512s">And</a>  can you tell us, with regard to Ashland Street, what would be the impact on the neighborhood with regard to people being able to access their driveways? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3456.56s">Are</a>  they going to be having problems accessing their driveways?</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3459.662s">Not</a>  at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3460.123s">The</a>  first utility pole that we're going to is basically at the corner of Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3464.746s">So</a>  there'd probably be just a couple of parking spaces from the first utility pole down to Salem Street that would be impacted. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3471.311s">And</a>  that work there is probably only going to take a day or so. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3474.935s">They</a>  would excavate the trench, install the conduit, and backfill it, you know, the same day or night, whatever the case may be.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3482.683s">And</a>  with regard to, you know, we've had a lot of talk during these hearings with regard to paving and how you're going to pave the work. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3492.794s">needs</a>  to be paid once you're done, you know, opening up the street and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3497.198s">And,</a>  you know, this has been a point of contention with anyone that opens up the street is over time, a lot of these holes, they sink and whatnot. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3505.987s">And</a>  I noticed that, you know, you're going to be making a payment to the city in lieu of the final payment. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3512.594s">So</a>  is that payment going to be, uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3516.965s">reimbursement</a>  from curb to curb paving or is that going to be just a reimbursement for the section that you cut open?</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3525.03s">I'm</a>  not too sure about the reimbursement on the paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3527.632s">I</a>  just recently saw this this morning and only had a short amount of time to kind of circulate this around, but I did see that there was some requirements in there on Ashland Street specifically to pave from the center line of the road to the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3541.843s">So</a>  I'm not sure if the city typically does that paving or if we bring our contractor in. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3546.244s">That's</a>  all something that we would have to work out when the street opening permit was issued.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3553.907s">So</a>  I guess regardless of who's doing the paving, it looks like you're going to be reimbursing for the paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3560.029s">So</a>  I guess my question is basically, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3563.615s">are</a>  you going to be reimbursing for curb to curb? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3566.356s">It</a>  sounds like enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3567.156s">It</a>  sounds like it's going to be maybe just for the sections that you are going to be opening up.</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3571.678s">Based</a>  off of what I saw on this, on the recommendations from the engineer, I can agree to be able to provide this customer service this year and keep the ball kind of moving forward to be able to do the work this excavation season. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3586.023s">I</a>  can agree to these stipulations here that the city engineer had wrote in the agenda.</p>

    <p>[John Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3594.253s">I</a>  think that might be a little bit of a point of contention. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3597.935s">I</a>  mean, just because I know that we have other utilities have been opening up roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3603.717s">The</a>  last meeting we had, we had a number of utilities that came before us. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3607.919s">And</a>  they basically promised that they would pave curve to curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3614.242s">And</a>  I feel like we're always setting precedent by doing this now. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3618.144s">And</a>  in some ways, I feel like almost all utilities that come <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3626.65s">colleagues</a>  may have a further comment on that but I just think that we need to make sure <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3635.233s">I</a>  see curb-to-curb repaving, I think it's a necessity just because we have so many, you know, I look at Salem Street, I mean, I think this is a good project, without a doubt, but I look at Salem Street, and that is a heavily traversed street, on a daily basis, and I can easily see, you know, if you're just going to be repairing patches, or even half the road, I could definitely see that being torn up over time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3659.668s">It's</a>  a big cut through the street methods because community. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3663.55s">And</a>  so I think curve to curve paving would be something that we should look at.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3673.758s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3676.187s">And</a>  first of all, I'd like to say, as someone who's been on the council a number of years, the lack of Wi-Fi in many sections of our downtown business district has always been a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3688.353s">And</a>  I'm glad to see this project moving forward, and I'm glad to hear that this will not only benefit Century Bank, but many other businesses in that Salem Street area. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3699.319s">We</a>  also had a petition three or four weeks back from Comcast to bring Wi-Fi into the old armory building. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3709.282s">And</a>  I know that's under unfinished business, but that's also a section of the square that lacks Wi-Fi. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3717.664s">And</a>  I'm glad to see this finally moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3721.02s">The</a>  question I had, and I think Councilor Falco touched upon it, is of recent the Council has been requesting that projects not be repaved just by trench work, but curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3737.436s">an</a>  issue of contention among this council. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3740.459s">And</a>  we've had some utility companies that have been willing to step forward and do curb-to-curb, knowing that, in my opinion, that's the best and most efficient way of putting back a street so we don't have to worry about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3756.954s">And</a>  the question I have on this particular proposal <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3760.797s">It</a>  does mention on Ashland Street, which is a highly traveled road also, as a cut through, it says center line to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3770.924s">And</a>  right now, I really would prefer curb to curb on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3776.148s">And</a>  it goes on to say in the last paragraph, it says the city will determine what the need is to replace, and Comcast will either replace or refund the replacement. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3788.236s">What</a>  exactly does that language mean? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3790.319s">That</a>  doesn't really say much to me.</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3792.542s">That's</a>  something that the city engineer wrote in, so I'm not really sure on clarification on that myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3799.25s">Typically,</a>  we do all our own paving. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3802.414s">Typically,</a>  we repave the trench. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3806.683s">If</a>  it's a two foot wide trench, we would go two feet on either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3809.665s">But</a>  in this case, it sounds like the engineer wants us to go to the center line of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3813.988s">So</a>  therefore, you would do a temporary patch, then we would bring our contractor back in and then pay from the curb to the center line. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3821.573s">Or</a>  I'm not sure on her, I need to get clarification. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3824.875s">If</a>  we do the temporary patch and then the city brings in their own contractor to do that curb to the center line.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3833.028s">Okay,</a>  and the way I read it is a little different. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3836.091s">I</a>  read it as the city will determine how these streets will be put back. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3840.855s">And</a>  not just whether Comcast will do the work or the city will do the work, but whether it would be curb to curb, centerline to curb, and the city will make that determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3850.739s">And</a>  I think as a member of the council, before we take a vote, we need to know what the parameter is on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3859.943s">And</a>  do you have the ability tonight to make a decision for curb to curb?</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3865.545s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3866.746s">And</a>  if that is a request of you tonight, you'd be able to make that?</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3869.767s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3870.587s">So</a>  I would put that, Mr. President, as a form of a motion on this paper that all work be done curb-to-curb based on the representative from Comcast on this particular project.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3884.242s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3885.864s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3886.284s">Councilor</a>  Dyke.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_33]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3888.327s">Mr.</a>  President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3889.944s">Very</a>  difficult for us to sit here and vote on a special permit when we don't have a traffic plan that's for us to review, that there's no clear and concise project schedule as to when this work is going to take place. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3902.952s">And</a>  the petitioner comes forward, and they've met their obligations that's been issued by the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3908.155s">But</a>  the city engineer has certain criteria and certain parameters that she'd like to see met. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3912.818s">But</a>  before we issue the permit, I think these are things that we also need to know. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3915.419s">I</a>  mean, we need to know if there's network that's going to be going on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3918.081s">We</a>  need to know if it's going to take eight months for them to fix this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3920.423s">We've</a>  entered into a situation where we have a project with a construction schedule in Medford where the Craddock Bridge, and it's been going on for three years. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3928.168s">But</a>  we don't know what the construction schedule is. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3930.229s">Now,</a>  it's 160 feet of conduit that's going to be delayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3933.431s">I</a>  think it's important that we deliver Wi-Fi to the business district in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3937.074s">I</a>  think that's going to be a key component for us to help revitalize the district. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3950.845s">We</a>  need to embrace technology if we're going to be able to do a better job in Medford Square and fill in those stores and making sure that it's a vibrant place that people want to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3958.367s">So</a>  with that being said, I don't have so much problem with the petition or the request that's being made, but I do have a little bit of problem with the information that's provided us from the administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3965.95s">And</a>  I'd like to see it, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3967.79s">You</a>  know, I think Councilor Marks is on the right track. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3971.211s">I</a>  mean, we want to see the curbs paved. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3973.292s">We</a>  want to see it paved curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3974.692s">That's</a>  been something we've been hounding on for four years. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3976.953s">It's</a>  a pet peeve of mine when I go down these neighborhood streets and I see French work and grounded inlay work that isn't completed or is completed shortly. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3984.938s">Sometimes</a>  it seems more so that public utility companies that provide gas and electricity than Comcast are more focused on getting the next shovel in the ground than they are about coming back and repairing the damage that they've done in the neighborhoods. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3997.965s">So</a>  that's one of the concerns that I have, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=3999.887s">Certainly,</a>  I think it's a noble cause, and I think it's a great idea and a great way for us to expand opportunities and methods of work. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4007.111s">I'm</a>  just a little bit concerned about the fact that we're not being provided with enough information for us to see a full picture, and we're being asked to vote on a special permit this evening without knowing exactly what direction this project is going to go and what to expect after the issuance of the permit.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4021.971s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4022.331s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4023.352s">Mr.</a>  President, I want to thank Councilor Knight for his insight on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4027.975s">A</a>  couple of things were mentioned here tonight, and a couple of things have been sort of brought to light as far as where the community stands on a number of things over this past week, only confirming some of the work that I've been doing for well over a decade. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4044.826s">First,</a>  let me say this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4047.675s">I</a>  think this is a good measure. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4048.975s">We</a>  need it in the square and Comcast needs to get this work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4054.696s">They're</a>  the primary provider here in the city of Medford and people need this service. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4062.578s">I'm</a>  looking at the language in this petition and what it says to me is that the city engineer has finally gone and she's doing something about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4075.752s">to</a>  decide the extent to which that any of these utility operators are going to have to repair our streets and that they're going to be directed by the office of the engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4091.844s">And</a>  if it's curb to curb that the engineer determines is needed, then that's what they're going to provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4098.288s">And</a>  I think we need to have a motion <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4100.83s">an</a>  amendment to this paper that the City Council understands that the language herein, this petition, for this public hearing and to have this work done, is saying that the City Engineer of the City of Medford will determine how much repair work has to be done to these streets and if it is curb to curb, that Comcast understands that and will fund <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4130.43s">the</a>  City of Medford and or their contractor to provide that type of repair to the streets for the people of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4139.817s">Traffic</a>  plans, traffic, digging up sales. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4147.72s">10</a>  of my 12 years on the Council, I've been involved in at least two plans for the revitalization of Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4155.167s">We</a>  had an unveiling to the general public last week of the redevelopment plan that has been presented. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4167.142s">not</a>  engraved in granite, but pretty close by the MAPC, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, which advises communities in the greater Boston area about planning and development. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4180.013s">We</a>  had several private contractors over the years advise the cities. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4184.637s">The</a>  plan has had its fits and starts, but we're on the verge of doing something right here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4193.524s">And</a>  one of the things that came out of the meeting this past week <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4196.408s">from</a>  citizens of Medford, from people who are eager to see us get going, is that we have to shake it up and make ourselves a little uncomfortable to get things going. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4207.273s">And</a>  one of the things that this project could enable us to do is see what it's like to tighten things up on Salem Street, to use that type of work as a diversion of traffic so the people of Winchester can stop using <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4224.622s">Salem</a>  Street, High Street, and Winthrop Street as their private superhighway. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4230.023s">And</a>  let them find another way. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4231.863s">Let</a>  them go up 93 and get off at Highland Ave, right in their own backyards, rather than going through our backyards and front yards. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4239.305s">So</a>  if it's going to tighten things up on Salem Street for some of the people that use it as their cutthroat to Winchester or to Arlington, all the best to them. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4251.367s">Let's</a>  look at this, let the engineering department and the community development department <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4260.953s">experiment</a>  with some of the things that were presented to us in this meeting as part of this plan so we can get a feel for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4268.579s">And</a>  I think the citizens of Medford will benefit. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4271.12s">They're</a>  going to benefit from getting this work done. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4273.482s">Hopefully,</a>  they'll get in there, get it done, and get lost, and give us the service that we need. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4279.566s">And</a>  Mr. President, I'm ready to vote for this and approve for it tonight. <a

you.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4287.816s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4288.697s">Thank</a>  my colleagues. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4289.458s">I</a>  think everybody has brought up some valid points and issues, concerns. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4293.961s">I</a>  appreciate Dave from Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4295.923s">I</a>  don't believe Comcast has any issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4300.607s">I</a>  have any issues with Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4301.868s">I</a>  think you've done your due diligence. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4303.709s">I</a>  think that the questions that were brought about this evening, I think that we've <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4310.014s">echo</a>  this my first meeting here at the council and what our roadways and sidewalks are looking at looking like with our utilities after they come in and use Medford for what they want and then just take off I think not I think excluding Comcast because they think that the conversation that we've had and the response that <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4330.3s">You</a>  put forth as your company. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4331.841s">I</a>  think that's been very receptive But I do echo what a few of my colleagues are saying in Which is the biggest point is City engineer we can talk going back and forth about voting and not voting I see but I think that you know my recommendation will be just to table this and have an emergency meeting with the city engineer and <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4354.869s">to</a>  get these questions answered. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4358.472s">Traffic</a>  plan, the positive aspect of bringing Wi-Fi in the square, that's a basic necessity I think everybody in our community should have, especially in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4372.003s">But</a>  understanding that how many neighbors will be making sure that they've been notified, both on Ashland and our businesses up and down Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4385.373s">I</a>  don't want to delay this, I want to push it forward, but at the same time I think we need to have these questions answered by our city engineer and her department. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4396.342s">So</a>  I find it, I want to move forward for our businesses and our community, but at the same <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4405.43s">I</a>  think that my colleagues have brought some valid points, unless we have some answers from our city side, and that's our engineer, about a traffic study, our timeline when we're doing the construction, our notification of our neighbors and our business owners, making sure that they were notified. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4426.342s">making</a>  sure that the pedestrians that are walking those sidewalks during that construction, that it's a safe, traversed area because it does go to one of the busiest bus stops in Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4441.398s">If</a>  I could, is there a way through the chair that we can call for a meeting as soon as possible with the city engineer? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4449.325s">Well,</a>  then my motion tonight would be to table and then move forward with trying to get the engineer and moving this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4459.234s">I</a>  don't want to delay it, so it does fall into construction questions. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4463.297s">but</a>  moving it to get these answers, these questions answered and then hopefully be back at the table by next week and get all these answers that we need that we can bring to our constituents and make sure that the job goes without any issues and it's brought back to <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4481.123s">you</a>  know, with what we've set as a standard here as a council for all of our utilities that we're saying curb to curb and making sure that the construction timeline and notifications are done properly and thoroughly.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4497.968s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4499.209s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4502.75s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4503.97s">I</a>  just want to be clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4506.208s">I</a>  understand what my colleagues are saying, but did I hear you say you would do curb-to-curb?</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4510.912s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4512.754s">And</a>  if I could also say, I mean, we're open to doing the work at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4516.477s">We</a>  just need to know if we're allowed to do the work at night, what would be the working hours, and then I would be able to give you a schedule to say.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4522.982s">Point</a>  of information, if I can. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4524.283s">Point</a>  of information. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4525.084s">I'm</a>  sorry. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4525.584s">This</a>  is the frustrating part. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4527.866s">This</a>  is something that the engineer, that we should have had from the engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4531.149s">This</a>  is something that you, as the contractor, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4534.632s">for</a>  Comcast, the business owner of Comcast doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4538.256s">So</a>  that's my frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4539.398s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4548.283s">If</a>  it wasn't such a busy thoroughfare in one of our main roads, I'd be ready to approve tonight, especially where you said curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4555.205s">But</a>  if we're going to meet on it next Tuesday at, say, 6 o'clock, if we could just get a copy in by Friday of the traffic plans.</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4562.426s">I</a>  do have a traffic plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4563.747s">I</a>  did submit it electronically yesterday, and you probably didn't get it in time. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4567.248s">And</a>  I do have a copy with me, but I only have one copy. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4569.928s">Is</a>  this it, Dick? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4572.029s">No,</a>  this isn't the traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4573.769s">This</a>  is what you said? <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4574.609s">That's</a>  the traffic.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4575.41s">Yeah,</a>  that's the traffic.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4578.314s">We've</a>  got an e-mail.</p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4580.415s">So</a>  again, that all hinges on, I mean, that may change if it's night work. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4584.176s">I</a>  mean, we'd probably be able to get a lot more work done if it's at night. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4588.137s">But</a>  I need to know, again, the working hours and what would be allowed. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4591.238s">And</a>  if we're going to notify the abutters, I'll need to give them some sort of a schedule.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4595.879s">And</a>  I have it too. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4597.64s">I</a>  was looking at it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4598.26s">It</a>  didn't look like the directions aren't on here. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4600.621s">But</a>  it does say where the cones will be placed, the signs, the work zone, things like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4604.922s">So</a>  I guess we do need probably some more clarification of where traffic's going to be diverted. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4610.194s">My</a>  last comment is that we, within our meeting, if we do meet on this, hopefully within the week, that we discuss what the standards are going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4618.882s">I</a>  know I had mentioned a month ago we were requesting curb-to-curb from one company and then with the other company we weren't requesting curb-to-curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4632.533s">So</a>  I just think we need to figure out a way that, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4635.02s">figure</a>  out what we want as a group collectively of going forward for all utility companies so we do it fairly and we require the same thing from every single company. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4645.782s">And</a>  I think the way we're on track with obviously making our streets be repaired much better than they have been and where things are sinking and dipping. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4656.984s">So</a>  I think we're on the right track. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4658.285s">I</a>  just think we need to have a discussion <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4661.357s">in</a>  committee on where we're going with this and make sure our city engineer is on board and thinks it's feasible.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4667.912s">Councilor</a>  Knight.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4669.513s">Mr.</a>  President, I don't think that the rub lies with the petitioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4672.075s">I</a>  think that the rub lies with some of the information that we've received. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4676.097s">I</a>  think that we've held a public hearing. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4677.758s">We've</a>  heard that there's really no outcry of opposition to the approval of this permit. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4682.781s">I</a>  think that really the issue is whether or not we as a council this evening are comfortable approving this permit with the contingencies that the traffic engineer, I mean that the city engineer submit the traffic mitigation plan and submit the traffic on the project work schedule. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4696.97s">to</a>  the Council for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4698.452s">So</a>  we could this evening, Mr. President, approve the permit with the contingencies that the traffic plan and the schedule of work be submitted to the Council for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4709.062s">So</a>  if the permit can be approved provided that those materials come into the Council and we approve those. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4714.407s">Just</a>  an option, just a way for us to maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4717.25s">move</a>  this along. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4717.95s">I</a>  don't think the problem lies with the gentleman from Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4720.091s">As</a>  I said, we just need a little bit more information to feel comfortable moving forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4723.613s">We</a>  could approve the permit with the contingencies that the city engineer provided us with the traffic mitigation plan and with the concise work schedule for approval. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4731.097s">And</a>  upon our approval, the permit will be issued. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4733.158s">But</a>  we don't need to bring the gentleman back. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4734.499s">I</a>  don't think we need to even have another public hearing on the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4736.66s">We</a>  can just ask that material to be forwarded to us and then vote as to whether or not we're comfortable issuing the permit at a later date.</p>

    <p>[Fred Dello Russo]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4743.006s">Councilor</a>  Dello Russo. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4743.806s">Mr.</a>  President, I think Councilor Knight is right, if I understood him, in that my amendment was to clarify this language as we're clarifying it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4755.512s">If</a>  we accept this amendment, we've clarified it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4758.493s">We</a>  want, and I think if we can understand a consensus that's come out of our <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4763.9s">discussions</a>  over the past year or two where this has become such a problem is that the engineer needs to supervise this better, these types of projects better, and hold the contractors accountable. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4780.254s">And</a>  it seems to me the way I read this language <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4784.164s">here</a>  in what she's added is that she's gotten it and she's doing that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4789.427s">And</a>  I'm comfortable letting the engineering department determine with the contractor the scope to which the repairs need to be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4801.933s">So</a>  if the engineer believes that it serves the people of Medford best, that it be curb to curb, then she's going to demand that of these contractors. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4811.537s">Quite</a>  frankly, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4812.758s">I'm</a>  not qualified. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4814.12s">I'm</a>  not an engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4815.641s">I'm</a>  not a construction person. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4817.723s">I</a>  can shovel snow. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4819.405s">I'm</a>  pretty good with leaves. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4821.868s">Every</a>  morning you'll see me at 6, between 6 and 7, sweeping cigarette butts in front of my office. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4828.662s">That's</a>  the scope of my construction skills. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4831.324s">But</a>  the engineer and her staff understand this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4836.368s">This</a>  is their profession. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4838.449s">And</a>  it seems to me, again, that they've gotten what they've asked. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4843.333s">And</a>  I think we should allow them, I don't think it would be wise on our part to mandate extremes where they're not necessary. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4852.9s">I</a>  think that the construction people need to be aware that National's Ridge had some serious problems historically in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4862.909s">So</a>  I think you're aware of that, that there's been some problems over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4867.613s">And</a>  as far as the traffic plane goes, if the engineer and the police department has signed off on that, that's never been our area of <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4878.161s">approval,</a>  and certainly day-to-day will mandate how the traffic needs to be dealt with, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4886.903s">So</a>  with the amendment that I've proposed, as I said earlier, I'm pleased and comfortable making an approval here, and I don't think we need to hold it up, nor do we need to have an emergency meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4901.927s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli has a motion.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4905.808s">If</a>  I can, I would rescind it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4907.149s">I</a>  appreciate Councilor Knight and Councilor Dello Russo's initiative. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4911.991s">I</a>  think that, again, my biggest concern is that what we set forth, I think, not only curb to curb, I appreciate that, move forward with that, but the idea of when the construction will, what's the timeline for the construction, and where the <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4929.869s">making</a>  sure that the neighbors were notified and having the understanding that personally I would rather see it done at night, especially if there isn't a residential area that's being, you know, if we could put that forward, the recommendation that it eliminates some of that congestion in Medford Square and to help our business owners. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4952.923s">the</a>  neighbors in that area, I'd be willing to take that off and make that as part of the amendment that goes forth to the city engineer.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4962.205s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4963.146s">Councilor</a>  Layton.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4964.146s">So</a>  as I understand it, Mr. President, the matter is that right now before the council would be moving for approval of the permit with the contingency that the gentleman has agreed to a curb to curb repaving that the city solicitor, I mean, the city engineer is going to report back to us what the construction schedule is going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4980.57s">And</a>  that the city engineer is going to also provide us with an updated traffic management plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4985.053s">And</a>  the council would also be issuing a recommendation that the work be done off hours during the evening as to not impact negatively the local businesses or the traffic flow in the area.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=4996.38s">And</a>  the, if I can, the notification to the neighbors again that they are given, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5003.164s">the</a>  proper timeline so they can understand what's going on in that section.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5006.708s">Summarized</a>  perfectly.</p>

    <p>[George Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5007.889s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5008.229s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[McKillop]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5016.682s">David</a>  McKillip, 94 Rock Glen Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5019.723s">One</a>  of the things that I just want to kind of touch base on is the curb to curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5023.946s">I</a>  think that Councilwoman Longo-Curran is 100% right, as well as Councilman Marks and a few others. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5030.989s">My</a>  recommendation on the curb to curb is that you folks get together and come up <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5042.947s">and</a>  project to project, it might not have the best resolution for one particular street. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5051.551s">So</a>  in other words, if they open up another section of a street and that opening might be four feet by six feet or five feet by eight feet, whatever it is, but there are four other openings on that street, that street has become a disaster. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5065.056s">So</a>  I don't agree with the fact that we're getting a little bit better because some of those streets have anywhere from <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5070.818s">two</a>  and three patches to five and seven patches. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5073.859s">So</a>  I think having a parameter set up where that person or that company has to be responsible for a curb to curb based off of length, width, depth, and the amount of openings that have already occurred on that street is probably a better direction to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5089.126s">So</a>  it's now something that you can use as a guideline as opposed to going from project to project. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5094.712s">And</a>  I think that's something that you should do prior to making these decisions going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5100.017s">I</a>  agree with Councilor Scarpelli of tabling this item and considering that prior to making those decisions, even though that they've already agreed to curve to curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5110.827s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5111.988s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[John Costas]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5117.413s">Hello,</a>  General Ancalastas, 25 Salem Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5123.563s">I</a>  understand everybody's concerns, and they're all valid, street safety, the whole nine yards. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5128.747s">And</a>  we have to hold somebody accountable for something. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5133.391s">So</a>  I'm not going to disregard as being not important. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5137.375s">It</a>  is very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5139.116s">But</a>  my part of Salem Street and behind Riverside Ave, we've been waiting a very, very long time for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5147.663s">Now,</a>  I went 30 years without anything but DSL. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5152.579s">Now</a>  we're fortunate enough that Verizon came in with Fiverr, and that's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5157.74s">But</a>  at this point, they're the only game in town for us. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5161.341s">So</a>  whatever they want, if we need a high-speed internet, we're going to go to Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5165.802s">I</a>  do have Verizon. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5168.263s">Comcast</a>  has done their homework. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5170.403s">They</a>  signed up a whole lot of businesses that would be interested in going to Comcast. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5176.225s">And</a>  the savings is great. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5178.205s">So</a>  what I don't want to see happen is as much as <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5181.839s">All</a>  these details are important. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5183.06s">I</a>  don't want to see Medford Square end up being kind of like, you know, a tug of war. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5189.462s">Well,</a>  we're going to hold Medford Square hostage until everything is where it's supposed to be exactly. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5195.425s">And</a>  in the meantime, us businesses on the square, we're just going to keep paying the higher rate to Verizon waiting for, you know, our expenditure to do what they need to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5204.189s">So</a>  whatever the council can do to move this along quicker, and I like the idea of the approval and then <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5211.972s">if</a>  you're satisfied with what they submit, you know, move forward and not come back to another public meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5218.317s">So</a>  please, you know, let's move this along as quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5221.28s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5222.521s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5223.742s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Richard Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5253.232s">I</a>  would ask if we could do it within the next 14 days rather than a month. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5257.075s">Point</a>  of information, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5258.536s">I</a>  do believe we had that meeting already. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5259.817s">We</a>  posed a series of questions to the city solicitor as to whether or not we could restrict the number of permits that are issued in the year, so on and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5266.181s">I</a>  think that maybe we want to reiterate our need for a response to that paper as well.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5271.098s">And</a>  I think we need to go one step further and create guidelines amongst the seven of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5275.02s">And</a>  I don't think that was specifically done at the last meeting. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5278.021s">And</a>  I agree, we do have unanswered questions that, um, there are a lot of things we asked Cassandra or Cassandra's office to be able to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5285.604s">And</a>  I think that's important to get some answers so we can regulate the companies and the work they do. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5290.326s">Mr.</a>  Clerk. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5290.626s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5291.026s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[TKixPlxrhGc_SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5382.57s">Yeah,</a>  I didn't think that it was curb-to-curb, I thought it was half.</p>

    <p>[Adam Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5457.087s">It</a>  was tabled based on a roll call vote, four in the affirmative, three in the negative. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5463.531s">I</a>  believe it was tabled for the purpose of receiving the answers to the questions that we had posed to the administration, but it doesn't say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5469.935s">It</a>  just says upon motion to table a roll call vote. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5474.538s">And</a>  it's not reflecting.</p>

    <p>[Michael Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5476.74s">Mr.</a>  President, if I could. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5479.161s">I</a>  happen to recall the discussion from three, four weeks ago <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5486.333s">even</a>  though I don't remember what I had for dinner last night. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5489.536s">I</a>  do recall that discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5492.199s">And</a>  at the time, the gentleman from Comcast, when we asked him if he could do a curb-to-curb, said he didn't have the authority to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5502.067s">So</a>  we asked him to go back and find out if that was in the specs to do curb-to-curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5508.033s">So</a>  I think that's where we left off, because that particular night, as you recall, we also asked <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5513.237s">another</a>  utility company, and they agreed to do curb-to-curb, but they had someone in the room that had the ability to make that decision. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5519.399s">So</a>  I don't know if this gentleman for the High Street project, which is going into the armory, I believe it's for a medical business that's in the armory that needs internet access. <a href="https://youtu.be/MjGBHu28DvM&t=5532.084s">So</a>  maybe if we can pose that question to the gentleman.</p>
