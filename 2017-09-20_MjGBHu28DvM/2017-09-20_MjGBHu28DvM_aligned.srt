1
00:35:04,788 --> 00:35:05,769
I need all that stuff.

2
00:35:05,789 --> 00:35:07,290
Did I get 300 buttons?

3
00:35:07,330 --> 00:35:08,731
Yeah, yeah.

4
00:35:08,811 --> 00:35:13,215
I said, right now, you're shooting for October 3rd.

5
00:35:13,255 --> 00:35:14,096
You know what I mean?

6
00:35:14,176 --> 00:35:19,641
If she gets me to the start, I'm going to wait a couple of weeks.

7
00:35:19,681 --> 00:35:23,504
She's had it for a while.

8
00:35:24,024 --> 00:35:27,988
So you're going to have to probably secure this for October 3rd.

9
00:35:29,004 --> 00:35:29,344

Dominic Kamara, 219 Lawrence Road, and I'm definitely in favor of this.

00:39:09,967 --> 00:39:10,567
Thank you very much.

Because, because, that's all we need to know.

You can after.

57
00:39:18,795 --> 00:39:21,037

58

Hearing and seeing none, that part of the meeting is closed.

59
00:39:26,042 --> 00:39:29,025
Is there anyone here in opposition to this hearing?

60
00:39:31,363 --> 00:39:35,924
Hearing and seeing none, that part of the meeting is closed.

61
00:39:38,545 --> 00:39:40,806
Those who would like to speak in favor, please step forward now.

62
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:42,606
Yeah, that would be it.

63
00:39:46,627 --> 00:39:47,688
Name and address of the record, please.

64
00:39:48,348 --> 00:39:51,209
Anita Flater, 5 High Street, United of Massachusetts, 02155.

65
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:54,030
And you were the owner, correct?

66
00:39:54,190 --> 00:39:54,430
Yes.

67
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:56,970
I'm the managing director of Ultimate Tango.

68
00:39:59,115 --> 00:40:06,217
We want to speak in favor of that and we basically want to express or explain the reasons why we need these extra hours.

69
00:40:06,757 --> 00:40:17,740
So Argentine tango is not simply just a dance, it's the whole culture that basically teaches people how to behave in public places when there is a dance involved.

70
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:27,504
and also involves different customs and habits of the cultural behavior between lady and the gentleman.

71
00:40:28,004 --> 00:40:42,171
So we have this, besides just teaching simply the tango during our regular classes, we also have these gatherings that are called milonga, where people come and practice their dance, but also meet socially.

72
00:40:42,551 --> 00:40:49,275
So those gatherings in Boston area are happening every day in different studios.

73
00:40:49,995 --> 00:40:53,397
And right now the only day that is not occupied is Sunday.

74
00:40:53,897 --> 00:41:05,664
So our starting day where we would like to use this additional two hours of business being open would be Sunday to start.

75
00:41:05,844 --> 00:41:08,546
We will not initially use any other day.

76
00:41:09,446 --> 00:41:18,613
So it will be once a week on Sunday when people will come at 9 o'clock for the special event and stay until 1 o'clock to dance.

77
00:41:19,654 --> 00:41:21,815
Those milongas have special settings.

78
00:41:21,836 --> 00:41:26,959
It's the gathering when people can sit, talk between each other.

79
00:41:27,019 --> 00:41:29,922
They usually come as a couple, husband and wife.

80
00:41:30,622 --> 00:41:34,405
people who are together, or sometimes come the whole families and they sit together.

81
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:40,129
There is a special code of dress, there is a special code of invitation, how to invite lady for dance.

82
00:41:40,449 --> 00:41:43,411
There is a special code how many dances they dance together.

83
00:41:43,431 --> 00:41:48,634
There is a lot of different little customs that people who dance tango, they know it.

84
00:41:48,695 --> 00:41:54,819
And of course, some of you participated in our opening night, so you're kind of familiar how it looks like.

85
00:41:55,811 --> 00:42:00,895
So there is no kind of like a wild party settings.

86
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,276
The music is very mild.

87
00:42:02,597 --> 00:42:04,959
People behave actually very, very politely.

88
00:42:04,999 --> 00:42:07,240
They care for the ladies, they care for the partners.

89
00:42:07,821 --> 00:42:10,743
They walk them in, they walk them to the car, so it's very safe.

90
00:42:10,803 --> 00:42:19,350
I explained all that to Mr. Sacco, the chief of police, who had a little doubt and he seemed to be understanding.

91
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:25,854
how it looks like, and we also invited him over, so that's why he now supports our application too.

92
00:42:26,695 --> 00:42:27,956
And that's pretty much it.

93
00:42:29,437 --> 00:42:43,427
Yeah, this is very much, I mean, one of the reasons also we have the event start by 9pm, because as we say, there are quite a lot of events happening during the week, you know, so this Sunday, there are another two studios who organized

94
00:42:44,355 --> 00:42:46,256
two more practicals in different hours.

95
00:42:46,336 --> 00:42:50,537
If we don't want to conflict, you know, the business, we want to respect the hour.

96
00:42:50,777 --> 00:42:53,938
The only hour we can start it will be like at 9 p.m.

97
00:42:54,138 --> 00:43:07,061
And because we finish also our lessons around 6 p.m., some people coming from New York and from different areas far away, and they want to just go home, maybe with the family, you know, take a shower, get ready for coming back to the party.

98
00:43:07,081 --> 00:43:12,983
Before they coming back, sometimes, you know, driving 45 minutes, some people driving one hour, and be in the studio just for

99
00:43:13,850 --> 00:43:18,452
And also in Argentina the milonga is 24 hours, so people just keep dancing.

100
00:43:18,612 --> 00:43:19,513
It's a kind of ritual.

101
00:43:20,013 --> 00:43:22,534
In Argentina we dance very much all day long, from 10 a.m.

102
00:43:22,574 --> 00:43:22,814
to 6 a.m.

103
00:43:22,834 --> 00:43:24,015
sometimes, longer.

104
00:43:46,355 --> 00:43:57,104
We also believe we will not interfere with anybody because it's a business area and also our music is really mild, like nobody even hear it outside.

105
00:43:57,644 --> 00:44:10,295
And since most people drive and there's plenty of parking here and it's a business district, most businesses are already closed, only two restaurants open till 11, then I don't think we're gonna collide with anybody specifically.

106
00:44:13,738 --> 00:44:13,998
Thank you.

107
00:44:16,024 --> 00:44:16,512
Come through the gate.

108
00:44:18,427 --> 00:44:19,908
Mr. President, thank you very much.

109
00:44:21,109 --> 00:44:23,871
I've reviewed the paperwork and the paperwork appears to be in order.

110
00:44:25,092 --> 00:44:28,174
I've noticed a couple of concessions that the applicant has made.

111
00:44:28,314 --> 00:44:31,797
Initially, the request was to stay open till 4 a.m.

112
00:44:31,837 --> 00:44:32,677
Sunday evenings.

113
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:39,802
Chief Sacco wasn't too fond of that idea and has approved a restriction of operation till 1 a.m.

114
00:44:39,842 --> 00:44:41,784
That's something that he feels as though he's comfortable with.

115
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:46,948
Also, I've noticed that the petitioner has agreed to have the doors locked at 11 p.m.

116
00:44:47,828 --> 00:44:59,124
And no one will be allowed to enter the facility unless they're buzzed in through an intercom system that they have there, which also has a camera capability so that they'll know who's outside the door so that random people won't be wandering in off the street.

117
00:45:00,306 --> 00:45:01,708
I do have a question for the petitioners.

118
00:45:02,008 --> 00:45:03,210
Is there going to be any live music?

119
00:45:08,087 --> 00:45:12,111
No, there is only going to be recorded music.

120
00:45:12,171 --> 00:45:17,736
Mr. President, the paperwork is in order and everything appears to be signed off on by other heads in the like.

121
00:45:18,717 --> 00:45:21,980
So with that being said, I see no reason in the way of this approval.

122
00:45:22,861 --> 00:45:23,962
Thank you.

123
00:45:24,262 --> 00:45:33,351
I think my first question you answered the sound will be mild, so you won't be able to have sound barriers around your facility.

124
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:39,462
Yeah, the sound of the rectangular is very mild music.

125
00:45:39,482 --> 00:45:40,843
It doesn't get out.

126
00:45:41,524 --> 00:45:47,689
Even the restaurant actors or us, we did a check sound with them, and they don't hear nothing.

127
00:45:47,709 --> 00:45:51,533
If we try to put on the maximum that we could use in it, and it doesn't get out.

128
00:46:01,318 --> 00:46:01,678
Thank you.

129
00:46:01,778 --> 00:46:08,842
And my second question, if you are going to be open until one and people will be dancing since nine, what are you doing?

130
00:46:08,862 --> 00:46:11,304
What will there be for food and beverage?

131
00:46:15,402 --> 00:46:20,965
During regular milongas we do not provide any food or beverage, just drinking water.

132
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:32,330
So no, sometimes, like we had an opening night, we did have a little snack to cheer people up, but normally no, there is no food provided by us, just drinking water.

133
00:46:34,476 --> 00:46:35,797
Thank you very much.

134
00:46:50,666 --> 00:46:54,008
Economic Development Committee, which takes care of signs.

135
00:46:54,688 --> 00:47:09,596
We've worked in several subcommittee meetings with the proprietors of this group quite intimately over the past few months, and I have to say that they've been the most congenial people.

136
00:47:10,256 --> 00:47:11,417
They've been compliant.

137
00:47:12,297 --> 00:47:13,619
to any of our requests.

138
00:47:14,139 --> 00:47:23,547
They've certainly made the effort to, and they have, attended all the meetings when we've scheduled them, which, as we all know, can be cumbersome for us.

139
00:47:23,667 --> 00:47:28,111
And so if they're traveling from other towns to come in, they've been great people and

140
00:47:31,225 --> 00:47:39,750
As a fellow business person here in Medford, I'm delighted to have them operating in our community.

141
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:42,652
They'll bring something new and diverse to us.

142
00:47:43,412 --> 00:47:45,493
It's something positive and energetic.

143
00:47:45,914 --> 00:47:51,817
And so I welcome this request and lend my voice of approval to it, Mr. President.

144
00:47:52,517 --> 00:47:52,898
Thank you.

145
00:47:53,478 --> 00:47:54,999
Anyone else would like to speak in favor of this?

146
00:47:57,947 --> 00:47:58,967
Name and address of the record, please.

147
00:47:58,987 --> 00:48:03,249
Once again, Dominic Camara, Chamber of Commerce, Governmental Affairs Committees.

148
00:48:03,290 --> 00:48:16,776
And I'd like to say that I was fortunate enough with several other people to have visited the Tango Studio when they first opened it up about roughly a month ago, when they inaugurated and sort of cut the ribbons symbolically, if nothing else.

149
00:48:17,136 --> 00:48:18,937
And I was very, very enthralled.

150
00:48:18,997 --> 00:48:21,158
I was very happy to see the operation.

151
00:48:21,218 --> 00:48:21,898
It's beautiful.

152
00:48:21,938 --> 00:48:25,480
It's downstairs at 5 High Street, for those of you who may not realize where the

153
00:48:26,201 --> 00:48:39,701
position of the place and that's where the old channel three thing used to be and it's very very nice very professional and so on and I gotta tell you with all the tango that was playing and so on and these two can dance oh my god

154
00:48:43,819 --> 00:48:53,744
And so when we left, myself and the other two or three guests that we went to visit that night, by the time I got up to the lobby, you couldn't hear a note of the music because it's downstairs, number one.

155
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:56,845
So even if it's loud and whatever it is, you're never going to hear anything.

156
00:48:57,345 --> 00:48:58,546
So disturbance is not an issue.

157
00:48:58,566 --> 00:48:59,446
But here's the bottom line.

158
00:49:01,227 --> 00:49:06,191
that you can bring to Medford Square is a desirable thing to have and to wish for.

159
00:49:06,491 --> 00:49:12,055
So I hope that another store like this opens up and wants to be open until 2 o'clock, let alone 1, you know, when the time comes.

160
00:49:12,375 --> 00:49:14,016
And that's pretty much what I have to say.

161
00:49:14,116 --> 00:49:15,817
And I welcome them in the city of Medford.

162
00:49:16,098 --> 00:49:18,579
I think they're wonderful, professional people, and they're so talented.

163
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,941
And I have nothing but happiness for them.

164
00:49:21,261 --> 00:49:21,541
Thank you.

165
00:49:21,622 --> 00:49:21,922
Thank you.

166
00:49:22,602 --> 00:49:25,084
And I for one can say I was there that night that they opened.

167
00:49:25,184 --> 00:49:26,486
I was very impressed.

168
00:49:26,506 --> 00:49:27,206
The men were dressed.

169
00:49:27,226 --> 00:49:27,987
The women were dressed.

170
00:49:28,607 --> 00:49:30,129
The dancing was outstanding.

171
00:49:30,209 --> 00:49:37,115
And like Mr. Kamara said, when I went down to the bottom floor there, I could barely hear the music in the hallway.

172
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:40,617
But again, she's promised that she can teach me how to tango.

173
00:49:40,697 --> 00:49:43,158
Anybody can do that.

174
00:49:43,298 --> 00:49:45,320
But again, I welcome them.

175
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:48,622
And I think the studio was very, very nice.

176
00:49:48,682 --> 00:49:50,503
And it's very impressive what I saw that night.

177
00:49:50,523 --> 00:49:52,024
If they weren't dressed, we'd be in trouble.

178
00:49:52,044 --> 00:49:52,544
That's right.

179
00:49:52,584 --> 00:49:54,846
We wouldn't give up hope.

180
00:49:54,926 --> 00:49:58,548
Move approval.

181
00:49:59,528 --> 00:50:01,330
On the motion by Councilor De La Russa.

182
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:01,710
Second.

183
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:03,411
Seconded by Councilor Knight.

184
00:50:03,511 --> 00:50:04,251
All those in favor.

185
00:50:04,552 --> 00:50:04,632
Aye.

186
00:50:05,909 --> 00:50:06,710
Motion passes.

187
00:50:07,251 --> 00:50:08,052
Thank you very much.

188
00:50:08,893 --> 00:50:09,994
And we'll hopefully be done.

189
00:50:10,034 --> 00:50:20,246
I'll be down for those dance lessons.

190
00:50:20,266 --> 00:50:20,767
Okay.

191
00:50:20,787 --> 00:50:20,827
7-17-617.

192
00:50:21,948 --> 00:50:24,931
Location of poles, attachment of fixtures, underground conduits.

193
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:35,307
We're hereby notified that by an order of the Memphis City Council, public hearing will be given at the Caron Theater in Memphis High School, 489 Winter Street, Memphis, Madison, 7 p.m.

194
00:50:35,928 --> 00:50:49,674
on Tuesday, September 19th, under petition by Comcast Cable Communications Management, LLC, for permission to lay and maintain underground conduits, manholes, handholes, vaults, and ladders with wires and cables,

195
00:50:50,114 --> 00:50:53,938
to be placed therein under the surface of the following public way.

196
00:50:54,698 --> 00:51:02,365
Several occasions to be placed in accordance with the plan titles proposed, Ashland and Salem Street, dated July 20th, 2017.

197
00:51:02,405 --> 00:51:02,906
Ashland Street.

198
00:51:06,552 --> 00:51:24,998
Starting at existing utility pole number 5143 on Asher Street, excavating in the roadway and placing two 4-inch PVC conduits 105 feet give or take to a proposed 24-inch by 36-inch vault located in the sidewalk on Salem Street.

199
00:51:25,587 --> 00:51:41,312
Salem Street from proposed vault number one, continuing with two four-inch PVC conduits, 160 feet, give or take, in the street to a proposed 24 by 36 vault located in the sidewalk.

200
00:51:42,327 --> 00:51:58,950
approved, chief engineer with a provision that prior to obtaining a trench permit from the city, Comcast shall submit a detailed traffic management plan to the engineering division and traffic division for review and approval.

201
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,111
Night work may be required.

202
00:52:01,811 --> 00:52:06,512
The impacted handicap access parking space will need to be relocated.

203
00:52:07,042 --> 00:52:13,409
Any work on Ashland Street will require grinding and inlaying the trench from centerline to curb.

204
00:52:13,469 --> 00:52:18,214
The trench paving of Salem Street will be asphalt-based coarse material.

205
00:52:18,274 --> 00:52:23,279
In addition, pavement will be made to the city in lieu of Comcast final pavement.

206
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:29,046
Sidewalk will be replaced in kind with curb removed and reset if necessary.

207
00:52:30,462 --> 00:52:34,804
Test pits, well in advance of the work, will be required at the crossing of Salem Street.

208
00:52:35,164 --> 00:52:45,748
Comcast plan shows that in electrical duct bank with no terminus minus, this must be corrected prior to conducting test pits.

209
00:52:46,408 --> 00:52:50,110
All city-owned sewer drain and water laterals must be shown as well.

210
00:52:50,550 --> 00:52:52,931
No city-owned or private utilities will be damaged.

211
00:52:53,513 --> 00:53:05,396
Water and sewer mains and services, for example, being crossed by the proposed conduit will be investigated by Comcast and the city in advance of the receipt of street opening permit.

212
00:53:05,756 --> 00:53:11,517
The city will determine which need to be replaced and Comcast will either replace or file a replacement.

213
00:53:12,137 --> 00:53:14,878
Proper vertical and horizontal clearances will be maintained.

214
00:53:15,437 --> 00:53:22,902
Overall, the contract shall utilize the city of Memphis standards and the manual of uniform traffic control devices as appropriate.

215
00:53:23,322 --> 00:53:25,163
Approved, Superintendent of Wires.

216
00:53:25,704 --> 00:53:27,144
Call 781-393-2425 for any accommodations.

217
00:53:27,164 --> 00:53:30,767
This is a public hearing.

218
00:53:31,207 --> 00:53:33,929
Those in favor of this, please step forward.

219
00:53:40,192 --> 00:53:41,853
Name and address of the record, please.

220
00:53:41,973 --> 00:53:45,674
Geron Costis, 25 Salem Street, owner of Metro Electronics.

221
00:53:46,634 --> 00:53:48,155
And definitely in favor of this.

222
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:48,735
Thank you.

223
00:53:49,035 --> 00:53:49,415
That's it.

224
00:53:50,136 --> 00:53:51,116
All right.

225
00:53:51,156 --> 00:53:54,137
Name and address of the record, please.

226
00:53:54,157 --> 00:53:56,138
Steve Forwell, Comcast Group in Massachusetts.

227
00:53:56,278 --> 00:53:57,398
I'm in favor of the project.

228
00:53:57,438 --> 00:53:57,678
Thank you.

229
00:53:57,698 --> 00:53:58,099
Thank you.

230
00:53:58,119 --> 00:53:59,239
To be able to provide a service.

231
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,500
Anyone else in favor of this project?

232
00:54:03,801 --> 00:54:06,882
Hearing and seeing none, we've closed that part of the meeting.

233
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:12,362
Anyone that is not in favor of this project, please step forward.

234
00:54:14,202 --> 00:54:17,483
Hearing and seeing none, we close that part of the meeting.

235
00:54:19,304 --> 00:54:21,665
If you, Mr. Comcast, if you could step forward.

236
00:54:21,685 --> 00:54:24,525
Mr. Comcast.

237
00:54:24,565 --> 00:54:24,946
Mr. Comcast.

238
00:54:26,606 --> 00:54:28,627
Name and address of the record base.

239
00:54:28,647 --> 00:54:29,807
Dave Walling, Comcast.

240
00:54:30,107 --> 00:54:32,088
Okay, could you please explain your project there.

241
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:36,482
In this project, we have a request from the Century Bank to provide service.

242
00:54:36,502 --> 00:54:42,804
We're basically going to be coming out of Ashland Street with two new conduits and trenching down Salem Street.

243
00:54:43,905 --> 00:54:57,731
Originally, the Century Bank is the customer, but in doing this project, we'll also be able to provide services to the customers on the odd side of Salem Street in conjunction with service getting down to the Century Bank.

244
00:55:00,658 --> 00:55:07,283
I did submit yesterday, a little bit late in the afternoon, a preliminary traffic plan for review.

245
00:55:07,303 --> 00:55:14,628
I don't know if we've had time to review that or not, but if approved, we will work with the city engineer to revise that as needed.

246
00:55:14,648 --> 00:55:15,889
Those maps?

247
00:55:17,370 --> 00:55:18,091
Those full maps?

248
00:55:18,191 --> 00:55:20,433
I think everybody has their maps with them.

249
00:55:25,597 --> 00:55:26,317
Mr. President?

250
00:55:29,139 --> 00:55:29,780
Mr. President?

251
00:55:36,793 --> 00:55:41,017
I have a few questions about just the project in general.

252
00:55:41,798 --> 00:55:49,525
So if you could just let us know and let people watching at home know, how long do you think this project is going to take?

253
00:55:50,586 --> 00:55:57,092
That's going to depend upon the street opening permit and when the work would be allowed if approved.

254
00:55:57,112 --> 00:55:59,374
I know that's a heavy congested area.

255
00:56:01,243 --> 00:56:10,871
Depending upon the digging and the amount of utilities, there's a few things based off of the engineer's comments that we're going to need to address prior to the work once we get that taken care of.

256
00:56:10,891 --> 00:56:18,457
I would say the work would probably take a week, maybe a little bit longer, again, depending upon the digging and the working hours.

257
00:56:19,338 --> 00:56:23,522
And do you think some of this work will be done at night, or is it mostly to working hours?

258
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:32,512
Again, it all depends on how that, on what the city engineer believe, when they issue the permit, if it's gonna be required night work or day work.

259
00:56:33,112 --> 00:56:36,433
It may make sense to do it at night and we may be able to get more work done.

260
00:56:36,533 --> 00:56:40,834
I just don't know what the working hours would be, what would be approved.

261
00:56:41,434 --> 00:56:44,835
And could you tell us, let's see.

262
00:56:47,657 --> 00:56:52,507
Basically, with regard to the sidewalks, you're going to be, I think, ripping up a few sidewalks.

263
00:56:52,607 --> 00:56:57,477
You're going to be, can you tell us a little bit about, you know, how many sidewalks you're going to rip up?

264
00:56:58,130 --> 00:57:00,192
You're going to be replacing them with cements?

265
00:57:00,492 --> 00:57:00,892
Yes.

266
00:57:00,932 --> 00:57:04,696
And can you tell us, is it two sidewalks, or do you know how many?

267
00:57:06,097 --> 00:57:22,230
I believe there's three vault locations in the sidewalk there, and I think, I believe, I haven't been out there in a while looking at this, but I believe there's at least two panels getting to where the vault locations, so there's roughly around eight panels total that would need to be replaced in kind.

268
00:57:23,451 --> 00:57:24,792
And they'll be replaced with concrete?

269
00:57:25,132 --> 00:57:25,272
Yes.

270
00:57:26,512 --> 00:57:36,540
And can you tell us, with regard to Ashland Street, what would be the impact on the neighborhood with regard to people being able to access their driveways?

271
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:39,102
Are they going to be having problems accessing their driveways?

272
00:57:39,662 --> 00:57:40,103
Not at all.

273
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:44,706
The first utility pole that we're going to is basically at the corner of Salem Street.

274
00:57:44,746 --> 00:57:50,791
So there'd probably be just a couple of parking spaces from the first utility pole down to Salem Street that would be impacted.

275
00:57:51,311 --> 00:57:54,915
And that work there is probably only going to take a day or so.

276
00:57:54,935 --> 00:58:00,301
They would excavate the trench, install the conduit, and backfill it, you know, the same day or night, whatever the case may be.

277
00:58:02,683 --> 00:58:11,132
And with regard to, you know, we've had a lot of talk during these hearings with regard to paving and how you're going to pave the work.

278
00:58:12,794 --> 00:58:16,418
needs to be paid once you're done, you know, opening up the street and whatnot.

279
00:58:17,198 --> 00:58:25,587
And, you know, this has been a point of contention with anyone that opens up the street is over time, a lot of these holes, they sink and whatnot.

280
00:58:25,987 --> 00:58:31,873
And I noticed that, you know, you're going to be making a payment to the city in lieu of the final payment.

281
00:58:32,594 --> 00:58:35,636
So is that payment going to be, uh,

282
00:58:36,965 --> 00:58:43,930
reimbursement from curb to curb paving or is that going to be just a reimbursement for the section that you cut open?

283
00:58:45,030 --> 00:58:47,512
I'm not too sure about the reimbursement on the paving.

284
00:58:47,632 --> 00:59:01,281
I just recently saw this this morning and only had a short amount of time to kind of circulate this around, but I did see that there was some requirements in there on Ashland Street specifically to pave from the center line of the road to the curb.

285
00:59:01,843 --> 00:59:06,224
So I'm not sure if the city typically does that paving or if we bring our contractor in.

286
00:59:06,244 --> 00:59:11,846
That's all something that we would have to work out when the street opening permit was issued.

287
00:59:13,907 --> 00:59:20,009
So I guess regardless of who's doing the paving, it looks like you're going to be reimbursing for the paving.

288
00:59:20,029 --> 00:59:22,450
So I guess my question is basically,

289
00:59:23,615 --> 00:59:26,276
are you going to be reimbursing for curb to curb?

290
00:59:26,356 --> 00:59:27,056
It sounds like enough.

291
00:59:27,156 --> 00:59:31,238
It sounds like it's going to be maybe just for the sections that you are going to be opening up.

292
00:59:31,678 --> 00:59:45,543
Based off of what I saw on this, on the recommendations from the engineer, I can agree to be able to provide this customer service this year and keep the ball kind of moving forward to be able to do the work this excavation season.

293
00:59:46,023 --> 00:59:51,405
I can agree to these stipulations here that the city engineer had wrote in the agenda.

294
00:59:54,253 --> 00:59:57,915
I think that might be a little bit of a point of contention.

295
00:59:57,935 --> 01:00:03,677
I mean, just because I know that we have other utilities have been opening up roads.

296
01:00:03,717 --> 01:00:07,899
The last meeting we had, we had a number of utilities that came before us.

297
01:00:07,919 --> 01:00:13,922
And they basically promised that they would pave curve to curve.

298
01:00:14,242 --> 01:00:18,024
And I feel like we're always setting precedent by doing this now.

299
01:00:18,144 --> 01:00:22,466
And in some ways, I feel like almost all utilities that come

300
01:00:26,650 --> 01:00:32,635
colleagues may have a further comment on that but I just think that we need to make sure

301
01:00:35,233 --> 01:00:58,245
I see curb-to-curb repaving, I think it's a necessity just because we have so many, you know, I look at Salem Street, I mean, I think this is a good project, without a doubt, but I look at Salem Street, and that is a heavily traversed street, on a daily basis, and I can easily see, you know, if you're just going to be repairing patches, or even half the road, I could definitely see that being torn up over time.

302
01:00:59,668 --> 01:01:02,850
It's a big cut through the street methods because community.

303
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:12,637
And so I think curve to curve paving would be something that we should look at.

304
01:01:13,758 --> 01:01:14,698
Thank you, Mr. President.

305
01:01:16,187 --> 01:01:27,353
And first of all, I'd like to say, as someone who's been on the council a number of years, the lack of Wi-Fi in many sections of our downtown business district has always been a concern.

306
01:01:28,353 --> 01:01:38,399
And I'm glad to see this project moving forward, and I'm glad to hear that this will not only benefit Century Bank, but many other businesses in that Salem Street area.

307
01:01:39,319 --> 01:01:48,442
We also had a petition three or four weeks back from Comcast to bring Wi-Fi into the old armory building.

308
01:01:49,282 --> 01:01:57,124
And I know that's under unfinished business, but that's also a section of the square that lacks Wi-Fi.

309
01:01:57,664 --> 01:02:00,325
And I'm glad to see this finally moving forward.

310
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:16,275
The question I had, and I think Councillor Falco touched upon it, is of recent the Council has been requesting that projects not be repaved just by trench work, but curb to curb.

311
01:02:17,436 --> 01:02:19,838
an issue of contention among this council.

312
01:02:20,459 --> 01:02:35,433
And we've had some utility companies that have been willing to step forward and do curb-to-curb, knowing that, in my opinion, that's the best and most efficient way of putting back a street so we don't have to worry about it.

313
01:02:36,954 --> 01:02:39,817
And the question I have on this particular proposal

314
01:02:40,797 --> 01:02:49,944
It does mention on Ashland Street, which is a highly traveled road also, as a cut through, it says center line to curb.

315
01:02:50,924 --> 01:02:55,567
And right now, I really would prefer curb to curb on that.

316
01:02:56,148 --> 01:03:07,456
And it goes on to say in the last paragraph, it says the city will determine what the need is to replace, and Comcast will either replace or refund the replacement.

317
01:03:08,236 --> 01:03:10,259
What exactly does that language mean?

318
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,121
That doesn't really say much to me.

319
01:03:12,542 --> 01:03:18,229
That's something that the city engineer wrote in, so I'm not really sure on clarification on that myself.

320
01:03:19,250 --> 01:03:21,253
Typically, we do all our own paving.

321
01:03:22,414 --> 01:03:24,917
Typically, we repave the trench.

322
01:03:26,683 --> 01:03:29,385
If it's a two foot wide trench, we would go two feet on either side.

323
01:03:29,665 --> 01:03:33,668
But in this case, it sounds like the engineer wants us to go to the center line of the road.

324
01:03:33,988 --> 01:03:41,013
So therefore, you would do a temporary patch, then we would bring our contractor back in and then pay from the curb to the center line.

325
01:03:41,573 --> 01:03:44,855
Or I'm not sure on her, I need to get clarification.

326
01:03:44,875 --> 01:03:51,320
If we do the temporary patch and then the city brings in their own contractor to do that curb to the center line.

327
01:03:53,028 --> 01:03:55,610
Okay, and the way I read it is a little different.

328
01:03:56,091 --> 01:04:00,154
I read it as the city will determine how these streets will be put back.

329
01:04:00,855 --> 01:04:10,083
And not just whether Comcast will do the work or the city will do the work, but whether it would be curb to curb, centerline to curb, and the city will make that determination.

330
01:04:10,739 --> 01:04:19,282
And I think as a member of the council, before we take a vote, we need to know what the parameter is on this.

331
01:04:19,943 --> 01:04:25,525
And do you have the ability tonight to make a decision for curb to curb?

332
01:04:25,545 --> 01:04:25,965
Yes.

333
01:04:26,746 --> 01:04:29,547
And if that is a request of you tonight, you'd be able to make that?

334
01:04:29,767 --> 01:04:29,947
Yes.

335
01:04:30,587 --> 01:04:43,061
So I would put that, Mr. President, as a form of a motion on this paper that all work be done curb-to-curb based on the representative from Comcast on this particular project.

336
01:04:44,242 --> 01:04:45,023
Thank you, Mr. President.

337
01:04:45,864 --> 01:04:46,264
Thank you.

338
01:04:46,284 --> 01:04:48,146
Councillor Dyke.

339
01:04:48,327 --> 01:04:48,967
Mr. President.

340
01:04:49,944 --> 01:05:02,832
Very difficult for us to sit here and vote on a special permit when we don't have a traffic plan that's for us to review, that there's no clear and concise project schedule as to when this work is going to take place.

341
01:05:02,952 --> 01:05:08,115
And the petitioner comes forward, and they've met their obligations that's been issued by the administration.

342
01:05:08,155 --> 01:05:11,897
But the city engineer has certain criteria and certain parameters that she'd like to see met.

343
01:05:12,818 --> 01:05:15,399
But before we issue the permit, I think these are things that we also need to know.

344
01:05:15,419 --> 01:05:17,801
I mean, we need to know if there's network that's going to be going on there.

345
01:05:18,081 --> 01:05:20,222
We need to know if it's going to take eight months for them to fix this.

346
01:05:20,423 --> 01:05:27,207
We've entered into a situation where we have a project with a construction schedule in Memphis where the Craddock Bridge, and it's been going on for three years.

347
01:05:28,168 --> 01:05:30,149
But we don't know what the construction schedule is.

348
01:05:30,229 --> 01:05:32,671
Now, it's 160 feet of conduit that's going to be delayed.

349
01:05:33,431 --> 01:05:37,054
I think it's important that we deliver Wi-Fi to the business district in Memphis Square.

350
01:05:37,074 --> 01:05:39,836
I think that's going to be a key component for us to help revitalize the district.

351
01:05:50,845 --> 01:05:58,187
We need to embrace technology if we're going to be able to do a better job in Memphis Square and fill in those stores and making sure that it's a vibrant place that people want to go.

352
01:05:58,367 --> 01:06:04,989
So with that being said, I don't have so much problem with the petition or the request that's being made, but I do have a little bit of problem with the information that's provided us from the administration.

353
01:06:05,950 --> 01:06:07,630
And I'd like to see it, Mr. President.

354
01:06:07,790 --> 01:06:11,171
You know, I think Councilor Marks is on the right track.

355
01:06:11,211 --> 01:06:13,172
I mean, we want to see the curbs paved.

356
01:06:13,292 --> 01:06:14,312
We want to see it paved curb to curb.

357
01:06:14,692 --> 01:06:16,313
That's been something we've been hounding on for four years.

358
01:06:16,953 --> 01:06:24,177
It's a pet peeve of mine when I go down these neighborhood streets and I see French work and grounded inlay work that isn't completed or is completed shortly.

359
01:06:24,938 --> 01:06:37,245
Sometimes it seems more so that public utility companies that provide gas and electricity than Comcast are more focused on getting the next shovel in the ground than they are about coming back and repairing the damage that they've done in the neighborhoods.

360
01:06:37,965 --> 01:06:39,806
So that's one of the concerns that I have, Mr. President.

361
01:06:39,887 --> 01:06:46,911
Certainly, I think it's a noble cause, and I think it's a great idea and a great way for us to expand opportunities and methods of work.

362
01:06:47,111 --> 01:07:00,760
I'm just a little bit concerned about the fact that we're not being provided with enough information for us to see a full picture, and we're being asked to vote on a special permit this evening without knowing exactly what direction this project is going to go and what to expect after the issuance of the permit.

363
01:07:01,971 --> 01:07:02,291
Thank you.

364
01:07:02,331 --> 01:07:03,032
Councilor Del Rosso.

365
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:07,054
Mr. President, I want to thank Councilor Knight for his insight on this.

366
01:07:07,975 --> 01:07:23,866
A couple of things were mentioned here tonight, and a couple of things have been sort of brought to light as far as where the community stands on a number of things over this past week, only confirming some of the work that I've been doing for well over a decade.

367
01:07:24,826 --> 01:07:25,647
First, let me say this.

368
01:07:27,675 --> 01:07:28,955
I think this is a good measure.

369
01:07:28,975 --> 01:07:34,256
We need it in the square and Comcast needs to get this work done.

370
01:07:34,696 --> 01:07:39,917
They're the primary provider here in the city of Medford and people need this service.

371
01:07:42,578 --> 01:07:52,140
I'm looking at the language in this petition and what it says to me is that the city engineer has finally gone and she's doing something about it.

372
01:07:55,752 --> 01:08:11,303
to decide the extent to which that any of these utility operators are going to have to repair our streets and that they're going to be directed by the office of the engineer.

373
01:08:11,844 --> 01:08:17,728
And if it's curb to curb that the engineer determines is needed, then that's what they're going to provide.

374
01:08:18,288 --> 01:08:20,090
And I think we need to have a motion

375
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:49,966
an amendment to this paper that the City Council understands that the language herein, this petition, for this public hearing and to have this work done, is saying that the City Engineer of the City of Medford will determine how much repair work has to be done to these streets and if it is curb to curb, that Comcast understands that and will fund

376
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:58,736
the City of Medford and or their contractor to provide that type of repair to the streets for the people of Medford.

377
01:08:59,817 --> 01:09:02,579
Traffic plans, traffic, digging up sales.

378
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:14,226
10 of my 12 years on the Council, I've been involved in at least two plans for the revitalization of Medford Square.

379
01:09:15,167 --> 01:09:25,656
We had an unveiling to the general public last week of the redevelopment plan that has been presented.

380
01:09:27,142 --> 01:09:39,092
not engraved in granite, but pretty close by the MAPC, the Metropolitan Area Planning Council, which advises communities in the greater Boston area about planning and development.

381
01:09:40,013 --> 01:09:43,656
We had several private contractors over the years advise the cities.

382
01:09:44,637 --> 01:09:51,843
The plan has had its fits and starts, but we're on the verge of doing something right here.

383
01:09:53,524 --> 01:09:55,926
And one of the things that came out of the meeting this past week

384
01:09:56,408 --> 01:10:06,573
from citizens of Medford, from people who are eager to see us get going, is that we have to shake it up and make ourselves a little uncomfortable to get things going.

385
01:10:07,273 --> 01:10:24,182
And one of the things that this project could enable us to do is see what it's like to tighten things up on Salem Street, to use that type of work as a diversion of traffic so the people of Winchester can stop using

386
01:10:24,622 --> 01:10:29,363
Salem Street, High Street, and Winthrop Street as their private superhighway.

387
01:10:30,023 --> 01:10:31,823
And let them find another way.

388
01:10:31,863 --> 01:10:38,745
Let them go up 93 and get off at Highland Ave, right in their own backyards, rather than going through our backyards and front yards.

389
01:10:39,305 --> 01:10:49,847
So if it's going to tighten things up on Salem Street for some of the people that use it as their cutthroat to Winchester or to Arlington, all the best to them.

390
01:10:51,367 --> 01:10:58,357
Let's look at this, let the engineering department and the community development department

391
01:11:00,953 --> 01:11:08,378
experiment with some of the things that were presented to us in this meeting as part of this plan so we can get a feel for it.

392
01:11:08,579 --> 01:11:10,720
And I think the citizens of Medford will benefit.

393
01:11:11,120 --> 01:11:13,142
They're going to benefit from getting this work done.

394
01:11:13,482 --> 01:11:18,966
Hopefully, they'll get in there, get it done, and get lost, and give us the service that we need.

395
01:11:19,566 --> 01:11:23,109
And Mr. President, I'm ready to vote for this and approve for it tonight.

396
01:11:23,629 --> 01:11:23,909
Thank you.

397
01:11:23,990 --> 01:11:24,850
With that amendment.

398
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:25,571
Thank you.

399
01:11:27,816 --> 01:11:28,657
Thank you, Mr. President.

400
01:11:28,697 --> 01:11:29,438
Thank my colleagues.

401
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:33,461
I think everybody has brought up some valid points and issues, concerns.

402
01:11:33,961 --> 01:11:35,723
I appreciate Dave from Comcast.

403
01:11:35,923 --> 01:11:40,587
I don't believe Comcast has any issues.

404
01:11:40,607 --> 01:11:41,788
I have any issues with Comcast.

405
01:11:41,868 --> 01:11:43,649
I think you've done your due diligence.

406
01:11:43,709 --> 01:11:49,514
I think that the questions that were brought about this evening, I think that we've

407
01:11:50,014 --> 01:12:09,540
echo this my first meeting here at the council and what our roadways and sidewalks are looking at looking like with our utilities after they come in and use Medford for what they want and then just take off I think not I think excluding Comcast because they think that the conversation that we've had and the response that

408
01:12:10,300 --> 01:12:11,821
You put forth as your company.

409
01:12:11,841 --> 01:12:34,689
I think that's been very receptive But I do echo what a few of my colleagues are saying in Which is the biggest point is City engineer we can talk going back and forth about voting and not voting I see but I think that you know my recommendation will be just to table this and have an emergency meeting with the city engineer and

410
01:12:34,869 --> 01:12:36,951
to get these questions answered.

411
01:12:38,472 --> 01:12:51,463
Traffic plan, the positive aspect of bringing Wi-Fi in the square, that's a basic necessity I think everybody in our community should have, especially in Memphis Square.

412
01:12:52,003 --> 01:13:03,072
But understanding that how many neighbors will be making sure that they've been notified, both on Ashland and our businesses up and down Salem Street.

413
01:13:05,373 --> 01:13:15,421
I don't want to delay this, I want to push it forward, but at the same time I think we need to have these questions answered by our city engineer and her department.

414
01:13:16,342 --> 01:13:23,988
So I find it, I want to move forward for our businesses and our community, but at the same

415
01:13:25,430 --> 01:13:44,312
I think that my colleagues have brought some valid points, unless we have some answers from our city side, and that's our engineer, about a traffic study, our timeline when we're doing the construction, our notification of our neighbors and our business owners, making sure that they were notified.

416
01:13:46,342 --> 01:13:58,461
making sure that the pedestrians that are walking those sidewalks during that construction, that it's a safe, traversed area because it does go to one of the busiest bus stops in Medford Square.

417
01:14:01,398 --> 01:14:09,265
If I could, is there a way through the chair that we can call for a meeting as soon as possible with the city engineer?

418
01:14:09,325 --> 01:14:19,214
Well, then my motion tonight would be to table and then move forward with trying to get the engineer and moving this forward.

419
01:14:19,234 --> 01:14:22,857
I don't want to delay it, so it does fall into construction questions.

420
01:14:23,297 --> 01:14:39,925
but moving it to get these answers, these questions answered and then hopefully be back at the table by next week and get all these answers that we need that we can bring to our constituents and make sure that the job goes without any issues and it's brought back to

421
01:14:41,123 --> 01:14:57,228
you know, with what we've set as a standard here as a council for all of our utilities that we're saying curb to curb and making sure that the construction timeline and notifications are done properly and thoroughly.

422
01:14:57,968 --> 01:14:58,769
Thank you.

423
01:14:59,209 --> 01:14:59,809
Mr. President.

424
01:15:02,750 --> 01:15:03,910
Thank you, President Carviello.

425
01:15:03,970 --> 01:15:04,751
I just want to be clear.

426
01:15:06,208 --> 01:15:10,512
I understand what my colleagues are saying, but did I hear you say you would do curb-to-curb?

427
01:15:10,912 --> 01:15:11,092
Yes.

428
01:15:12,754 --> 01:15:16,136
And if I could also say, I mean, we're open to doing the work at night.

429
01:15:16,477 --> 01:15:22,962
We just need to know if we're allowed to do the work at night, what would be the working hours, and then I would be able to give you a schedule to say.

430
01:15:22,982 --> 01:15:24,263
Point of information, if I can.

431
01:15:24,283 --> 01:15:25,044
Point of information.

432
01:15:25,084 --> 01:15:25,564
I'm sorry.

433
01:15:25,584 --> 01:15:27,486
This is the frustrating part.

434
01:15:27,866 --> 01:15:31,129
This is something that the engineer, that we should have had from the engineer.

435
01:15:31,149 --> 01:15:33,972
This is something that you, as the contractor,

436
01:15:34,632 --> 01:15:37,996
for Comcast, the business owner of Comcast doing that.

437
01:15:38,256 --> 01:15:39,358
So that's my frustration.

438
01:15:39,398 --> 01:15:40,499
So thank you.

439
01:15:48,283 --> 01:15:55,165
If it wasn't such a busy thoroughfare in one of our main roads, I'd be ready to approve tonight, especially where you said curb to curb.

440
01:15:55,205 --> 01:16:01,966
But if we're going to meet on it next Tuesday at, say, 6 o'clock, if we could just get a copy in by Friday of the traffic plans.

441
01:16:02,426 --> 01:16:03,687
I do have a traffic plan.

442
01:16:03,747 --> 01:16:07,228
I did submit it electronically yesterday, and you probably didn't get it in time.

443
01:16:07,248 --> 01:16:09,588
And I do have a copy with me, but I only have one copy.

444
01:16:09,928 --> 01:16:11,489
Is this it, Dick?

445
01:16:12,029 --> 01:16:13,749
No, this isn't the traffic.

446
01:16:13,769 --> 01:16:14,589
This is what you said?

447
01:16:14,609 --> 01:16:15,309
That's the traffic.

448
01:16:15,410 --> 01:16:16,510
Yeah, that's the traffic.

449
01:16:18,314 --> 01:16:18,883
We've got an e-mail.

450
01:16:20,415 --> 01:16:24,156
So again, that all hinges on, I mean, that may change if it's night work.

451
01:16:24,176 --> 01:16:27,657
I mean, we'd probably be able to get a lot more work done if it's at night.

452
01:16:28,137 --> 01:16:31,198
But I need to know, again, the working hours and what would be allowed.

453
01:16:31,238 --> 01:16:35,099
And if we're going to notify the abutters, I'll need to give them some sort of a schedule.

454
01:16:35,879 --> 01:16:37,620
And I have it too.

455
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:38,240
I was looking at it.

456
01:16:38,260 --> 01:16:40,541
It didn't look like the directions aren't on here.

457
01:16:40,621 --> 01:16:44,882
But it does say where the cones will be placed, the signs, the work zone, things like that.

458
01:16:44,922 --> 01:16:49,523
So I guess we do need probably some more clarification of where traffic's going to be diverted.

459
01:16:50,194 --> 01:16:58,721
My last comment is that we, within our meeting, if we do meet on this, hopefully within the week, that we discuss what the standards are going to be.

460
01:16:58,882 --> 01:17:12,513
I know I had mentioned a month ago we were requesting curb-to-curb from one company and then with the other company we weren't requesting curb-to-curb.

461
01:17:12,533 --> 01:17:14,355
So I just think we need to figure out a way that,

462
01:17:15,020 --> 01:17:25,702
figure out what we want as a group collectively of going forward for all utility companies so we do it fairly and we require the same thing from every single company.

463
01:17:25,782 --> 01:17:36,244
And I think the way we're on track with obviously making our streets be repaired much better than they have been and where things are sinking and dipping.

464
01:17:36,984 --> 01:17:38,265
So I think we're on the right track.

465
01:17:38,285 --> 01:17:39,905
I just think we need to have a discussion

466
01:17:41,357 --> 01:17:46,762
in committee on where we're going with this and make sure our city engineer is on board and thinks it's feasible.

467
01:17:47,912 --> 01:17:48,392
Councilor Knight.

468
01:17:49,513 --> 01:17:52,055
Mr. President, I don't think that the rub lies with the petitioner.

469
01:17:52,075 --> 01:17:55,557
I think that the rub lies with some of the information that we've received.

470
01:17:56,097 --> 01:17:57,718
I think that we've held a public hearing.

471
01:17:57,758 --> 01:18:01,641
We've heard that there's really no outcry of opposition to the approval of this permit.

472
01:18:02,781 --> 01:18:16,670
I think that really the issue is whether or not we as a council this evening are comfortable approving this permit with the contingencies that the traffic engineer, I mean that the city engineer submit the traffic mitigation plan and submit the traffic on the project work schedule.

473
01:18:16,970 --> 01:18:18,071
to the Council for approval.

474
01:18:18,452 --> 01:18:29,022
So we could this evening, Mr. President, approve the permit with the contingencies that the traffic plan and the schedule of work be submitted to the Council for approval.

475
01:18:29,062 --> 01:18:33,466
So if the permit can be approved provided that those materials come into the Council and we approve those.

476
01:18:34,407 --> 01:18:36,389
Just an option, just a way for us to maybe

477
01:18:37,250 --> 01:18:37,930
move this along.

478
01:18:37,950 --> 01:18:40,031
I don't think the problem lies with the gentleman from Comcast.

479
01:18:40,091 --> 01:18:43,293
As I said, we just need a little bit more information to feel comfortable moving forward.

480
01:18:43,613 --> 01:18:50,997
We could approve the permit with the contingencies that the city engineer provided us with the traffic mitigation plan and with the concise work schedule for approval.

481
01:18:51,097 --> 01:18:52,618
And upon our approval, the permit will be issued.

482
01:18:53,158 --> 01:18:54,479
But we don't need to bring the gentleman back.

483
01:18:54,499 --> 01:18:56,620
I don't think we need to even have another public hearing on the matter.

484
01:18:56,660 --> 01:19:01,222
We can just ask that material to be forwarded to us and then vote as to whether or not we're comfortable issuing the permit at a later date.

485
01:19:03,006 --> 01:19:03,786
Councilor Del Rosso.

486
01:19:03,806 --> 01:19:14,751
Mr. President, I think Councilor Knight is right, if I understood him, in that my amendment was to clarify this language as we're clarifying it.

487
01:19:15,512 --> 01:19:18,013
If we accept this amendment, we've clarified it.

488
01:19:18,493 --> 01:19:23,375
We want, and I think if we can understand a consensus that's come out of our

489
01:19:23,900 --> 01:19:39,714
discussions over the past year or two where this has become such a problem is that the engineer needs to supervise this better, these types of projects better, and hold the contractors accountable.

490
01:19:40,254 --> 01:19:43,157
And it seems to me the way I read this language

491
01:19:44,164 --> 01:19:48,906
here in what she's added is that she's gotten it and she's doing that.

492
01:19:49,427 --> 01:20:01,473
And I'm comfortable letting the engineering department determine with the contractor the scope to which the repairs need to be done.

493
01:20:01,933 --> 01:20:11,117
So if the engineer believes that it serves the people of Medford best, that it be curb to curb, then she's going to demand that of these contractors.

494
01:20:11,537 --> 01:20:12,298
Quite frankly,

495
01:20:12,758 --> 01:20:13,939
I'm not qualified.

496
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:15,281
I'm not an engineer.

497
01:20:15,641 --> 01:20:17,263
I'm not a construction person.

498
01:20:17,723 --> 01:20:19,005
I can shovel snow.

499
01:20:19,405 --> 01:20:21,347
I'm pretty good with leaves.

500
01:20:21,868 --> 01:20:26,693
Every morning you'll see me at 6, between 6 and 7, sweeping cigarette butts in front of my office.

501
01:20:28,662 --> 01:20:30,663
That's the scope of my construction skills.

502
01:20:31,324 --> 01:20:36,027
But the engineer and her staff understand this.

503
01:20:36,368 --> 01:20:37,709
This is their profession.

504
01:20:38,449 --> 01:20:42,692
And it seems to me, again, that they've gotten what they've asked.

505
01:20:43,333 --> 01:20:52,180
And I think we should allow them, I don't think it would be wise on our part to mandate extremes where they're not necessary.

506
01:20:52,900 --> 01:21:02,869
I think that the construction people need to be aware that National's Ridge had some serious problems historically in that area.

507
01:21:02,909 --> 01:21:07,012
So I think you're aware of that, that there's been some problems over there.

508
01:21:07,613 --> 01:21:16,080
And as far as the traffic plane goes, if the engineer and the police department has signed off on that, that's never been our area of

509
01:21:18,161 --> 01:21:26,483
approval, and certainly day-to-day will mandate how the traffic needs to be dealt with, Mr. President.

510
01:21:26,903 --> 01:21:41,446
So with the amendment that I've proposed, as I said earlier, I'm pleased and comfortable making an approval here, and I don't think we need to hold it up, nor do we need to have an emergency meeting.

511
01:21:41,927 --> 01:21:43,347
Councillor Scarfelli has a motion.

512
01:21:45,808 --> 01:21:47,069
If I can, I would rescind it.

513
01:21:47,149 --> 01:21:51,931
I appreciate Councilor Knight and Councilor De La Russo's initiative.

514
01:21:51,991 --> 01:22:09,000
I think that, again, my biggest concern is that what we set forth, I think, not only curb to curb, I appreciate that, move forward with that, but the idea of when the construction will, what's the timeline for the construction, and where the

515
01:22:09,869 --> 01:22:31,242
making sure that the neighbors were notified and having the understanding that personally I would rather see it done at night, especially if there isn't a residential area that's being, you know, if we could put that forward, the recommendation that it eliminates some of that congestion in Meffitt Square and to help our business owners.

516
01:22:32,923 --> 01:22:41,505
the neighbors in that area, I'd be willing to take that off and make that as part of the amendment that goes forth to the city engineer.

517
01:22:42,205 --> 01:22:42,545
Thank you.

518
01:22:43,146 --> 01:22:44,106
Councilor Layton.

519
01:22:44,146 --> 01:23:00,070
So as I understand it, Mr. President, the matter is that right now before the council would be moving for approval of the permit with the contingency that the gentleman has agreed to a curb to curb repaving that the city solicitor, I mean, the city engineer is going to report back to us what the construction schedule is going to be.

520
01:23:00,570 --> 01:23:04,673
And that the city engineer is going to also provide us with an updated traffic management plan.

521
01:23:05,053 --> 01:23:15,559
And the council would also be issuing a recommendation that the work be done off hours during the evening as to not impact negatively the local businesses or the traffic flow in the area.

522
01:23:16,380 --> 01:23:22,204
And the, if I can, the notification to the neighbors again that they are given, you know,

523
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:26,688
the proper timeline so they can understand what's going on in that section.

524
01:23:26,708 --> 01:23:27,809
Summarized perfectly.

525
01:23:27,889 --> 01:23:28,209
Thank you.

526
01:23:28,229 --> 01:23:28,530
Thank you.

527
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:28,810
Thank you.

528
01:23:28,990 --> 01:23:29,891
Thank you.

529
01:23:30,051 --> 01:23:31,172
I think somebody else would like to speak.

530
01:23:34,495 --> 01:23:35,596
Name and address on the record, please.

531
01:23:36,682 --> 01:23:38,623
David McKillip, 94 Rock Glen Road.

532
01:23:39,723 --> 01:23:43,585
One of the things that I just want to kind of touch base on is the curb to curb.

533
01:23:43,946 --> 01:23:50,209
I think that Councilwoman Longo-Curran is 100% right, as well as Councilman Marks and a few others.

534
01:23:50,989 --> 01:23:54,911
My recommendation on the curb to curb is that you folks get together and come up

535
01:24:02,947 --> 01:24:11,410
and project to project, it might not have the best resolution for one particular street.

536
01:24:11,551 --> 01:24:24,596
So in other words, if they open up another section of a street and that opening might be four feet by six feet or five feet by eight feet, whatever it is, but there are four other openings on that street, that street has become a disaster.

537
01:24:25,056 --> 01:24:30,278
So I don't agree with the fact that we're getting a little bit better because some of those streets have anywhere from

538
01:24:30,818 --> 01:24:33,459
two and three patches to five and seven patches.

539
01:24:33,859 --> 01:24:49,026
So I think having a parameter set up where that person or that company has to be responsible for a curb to curb based off of length, width, depth, and the amount of openings that have already occurred on that street is probably a better direction to go.

540
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:54,308
So it's now something that you can use as a guideline as opposed to going from project to project.

541
01:24:54,712 --> 01:24:59,997
And I think that's something that you should do prior to making these decisions going forward.

542
01:25:00,017 --> 01:25:10,807
I agree with Counselor Scarpelli of tabling this item and considering that prior to making those decisions, even though that they've already agreed to curve to curve.

543
01:25:10,827 --> 01:25:11,768
Thank you.

544
01:25:11,988 --> 01:25:12,328
Thank you.

545
01:25:15,651 --> 01:25:16,852
Name and address of the record, please.

546
01:25:17,413 --> 01:25:18,914
Hello, General Ancalastas, 25 Salem Street.

547
01:25:23,563 --> 01:25:28,667
I understand everybody's concerns, and they're all valid, street safety, the whole nine yards.

548
01:25:28,747 --> 01:25:32,190
And we have to hold somebody accountable for something.

549
01:25:33,391 --> 01:25:37,275
So I'm not going to disregard as being not important.

550
01:25:37,375 --> 01:25:38,376
It is very important.

551
01:25:39,116 --> 01:25:47,123
But my part of Salem Street and behind Riverside Ave, we've been waiting a very, very long time for this.

552
01:25:47,663 --> 01:25:51,427
Now, I went 30 years without anything but DSL.

553
01:25:52,579 --> 01:25:57,520
Now we're fortunate enough that Verizon came in with Fiverr, and that's great.

554
01:25:57,740 --> 01:26:00,461
But at this point, they're the only game in town for us.

555
01:26:01,341 --> 01:26:05,782
So whatever they want, if we need a high-speed internet, we're going to go to Verizon.

556
01:26:05,802 --> 01:26:06,922
I do have Verizon.

557
01:26:08,263 --> 01:26:09,723
Comcast has done their homework.

558
01:26:10,403 --> 01:26:15,625
They signed up a whole lot of businesses that would be interested in going to Comcast.

559
01:26:16,225 --> 01:26:17,445
And the savings is great.

560
01:26:18,205 --> 01:26:21,146
So what I don't want to see happen is as much as

561
01:26:21,839 --> 01:26:23,020
All these details are important.

562
01:26:23,060 --> 01:26:29,142
I don't want to see Medford Square end up being kind of like, you know, a tug of war.

563
01:26:29,462 --> 01:26:35,005
Well, we're going to hold Medford Square hostage until everything is where it's supposed to be exactly.

564
01:26:35,425 --> 01:26:44,089
And in the meantime, us businesses on the square, we're just going to keep paying the higher rate to Verizon waiting for, you know, our expenditure to do what they need to do.

565
01:26:44,189 --> 01:26:50,592
So whatever the council can do to move this along quicker, and I like the idea of the approval and then

566
01:26:51,972 --> 01:26:57,436
if you're satisfied with what they submit, you know, move forward and not come back to another public meeting.

567
01:26:58,317 --> 01:27:01,220
So please, you know, let's move this along as quickly.

568
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:02,000
I appreciate it.

569
01:27:02,521 --> 01:27:02,841
Thank you.

570
01:27:03,742 --> 01:27:04,082
Thank you.

571
01:27:06,284 --> 01:27:07,825
Move for approval as amended, Mr. President.

572
01:27:07,865 --> 01:27:09,606
Counselor Scarpelli has a motion to take.

573
01:27:09,646 --> 01:27:11,188
I believe I said it.

574
01:27:11,228 --> 01:27:14,891
Move on to the recommendations of Councilor Knight.

575
01:27:14,971 --> 01:27:16,232
Move for approval as amended.

576
01:27:16,272 --> 01:27:20,075
Motion by Councilor Knight for approval, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso.

577
01:27:20,115 --> 01:27:20,455
Mr. Clerk.

578
01:27:21,983 --> 01:27:24,425
Please call the roll.

579
01:27:24,645 --> 01:27:32,671
Just as a B paper, if we could set up a meeting within the next month to discuss standards and guidelines, I think that is important.

580
01:27:33,232 --> 01:27:37,055
I would ask if we could do it within the next 14 days rather than a month.

581
01:27:37,075 --> 01:27:38,115
Point of information, Mr. President.

582
01:27:38,536 --> 01:27:39,797
I do believe we had that meeting already.

583
01:27:39,817 --> 01:27:46,121
We posed a series of questions to the city solicitor as to whether or not we could restrict the number of permits that are issued in the year, so on and so forth.

584
01:27:46,181 --> 01:27:50,465
I think that maybe we want to reiterate our need for a response to that paper as well.

585
01:27:51,098 --> 01:27:54,940
And I think we need to go one step further and create guidelines amongst the seven of us.

586
01:27:55,020 --> 01:27:57,961
And I don't think that was specifically done at the last meeting.

587
01:27:58,021 --> 01:28:05,544
And I agree, we do have unanswered questions that, um, there are a lot of things we asked Cassandra or Cassandra's office to be able to do.

588
01:28:05,604 --> 01:28:10,306
And I think that's important to get some answers so we can regulate the companies and the work they do.

589
01:28:10,326 --> 01:28:10,606
Mr. Clerk.

590
01:28:10,626 --> 01:28:10,886
Yes.

591
01:28:11,026 --> 01:28:11,206
Yes.

592
01:28:20,905 --> 01:28:21,246
Yes.

593
01:28:21,426 --> 01:28:21,846
Yes.

594
01:28:22,046 --> 01:28:22,447
Yes.

595
01:28:22,507 --> 01:28:22,747
Yes.

596
01:28:23,228 --> 01:28:23,308
Yes.

597
01:28:23,348 --> 01:28:23,408
Yes.

598
01:28:42,575 --> 01:28:47,998
I know we have a paper that's been tabled 17-593.

599
01:28:48,199 --> 01:29:00,706
I believe that Comcast Cable Communications Management LLC High Street, the position High Street and Hillside Ave for intersection.

600
01:29:01,267 --> 01:29:06,570
I believe that we're waiting on a question that maybe could be answered to move this forward.

601
01:29:07,130 --> 01:29:09,472
I believe the question was that we were asking for

602
01:29:12,051 --> 01:29:13,232
We can't take it off the table.

603
01:29:14,253 --> 01:29:18,297
Motion by Councilman Scafelli to take this up 17-593 off the table.

604
01:29:18,898 --> 01:29:19,519
All those in favor?

605
01:29:19,539 --> 01:29:20,179
Aye.

606
01:29:20,420 --> 01:29:21,160
Motion passes.

607
01:29:21,801 --> 01:29:23,343
Thank you, Mr. President.

608
01:29:23,383 --> 01:29:27,687
Again, I apologize for jumping the gun, but I believe we're asking

609
01:29:29,165 --> 01:29:39,209
some clarification on this paper that we asked Comcast to report back to us to see if that job could be curb-to-curb also paving.

610
01:29:39,229 --> 01:29:41,790
So if you have any, can you respond to that?

611
01:29:42,570 --> 01:29:45,892
Yeah, I didn't think that it was curb-to-curb, I thought it was half.

612
01:29:58,635 --> 01:30:00,177
My recollection is curb to curb.

613
01:30:02,018 --> 01:30:03,259
We have a copy of the minutes, right?

614
01:30:03,279 --> 01:30:05,261
Could you, from the last meeting, cut the copy?

615
01:30:34,912 --> 01:30:36,853
17-593 Comcast Cable Communications Management, LLC, August 15, 2017.

616
01:30:55,966 --> 01:30:57,067
Mr. President, if I could.

617
01:30:57,087 --> 01:31:02,070
It was tabled based on a roll call vote, four in the affirmative, three in the negative.

618
01:31:03,531 --> 01:31:09,915
I believe it was tabled for the purpose of receiving the answers to the questions that we had posed to the administration, but it doesn't say that.

619
01:31:09,935 --> 01:31:14,518
It just says upon motion to table a roll call vote.

620
01:31:14,538 --> 01:31:15,679
And it's not reflecting.

621
01:31:16,740 --> 01:31:17,620
Mr. President, if I could.

622
01:31:19,161 --> 01:31:24,745
I happen to recall the discussion from three, four weeks ago

623
01:31:26,333 --> 01:31:28,515
even though I don't remember what I had for dinner last night.

624
01:31:29,536 --> 01:31:31,238
I do recall that discussion.

625
01:31:32,199 --> 01:31:41,407
And at the time, the gentleman from Comcast, when we asked him if he could do a curb-to-curb, said he didn't have the authority to do so.

626
01:31:42,067 --> 01:31:47,592
So we asked him to go back and find out if that was in the specs to do curb-to-curb.

627
01:31:48,033 --> 01:31:52,617
So I think that's where we left off, because that particular night, as you recall, we also asked

628
01:31:53,237 --> 01:31:58,939
another utility company, and they agreed to do curb-to-curb, but they had someone in the room that had the ability to make that decision.

629
01:31:59,399 --> 01:32:11,104
So I don't know if this gentleman for the High Street project, which is going into the armory, I believe it's for a medical business that's in the armory that needs internet access.

630
01:32:12,084 --> 01:32:16,446
So maybe if we can pose that question to the gentleman.

631
01:32:16,926 --> 01:32:18,467
For the record, Dave Walling, Comcast.

632
01:32:20,663 --> 01:32:26,364
I was going by the agenda from the trench to the curb.

633
01:32:27,084 --> 01:32:30,165
But again, if it's curb to curb, I can agree to curb to curb.

634
01:32:30,905 --> 01:32:38,907
And we'll work with the same as the other petition on the schedule, whether it be at night or we'll work on the traffic management plan.

635
01:32:40,327 --> 01:32:43,488
I know this customer is looking for the service, so I'm looking to move this forward.

636
01:32:43,508 --> 01:32:45,048
We don't want to slow it down.

637
01:32:45,068 --> 01:32:49,529
OK, if we can, on the motion that we move forward with the same stipulations.

638
01:32:50,609 --> 01:32:55,371
On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelley, seconded by Councilor Del Rosso.

639
01:32:55,431 --> 01:32:57,292
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

640
01:32:57,352 --> 01:33:01,433
Just for clarity, Mr. President, so paper 17593 is off the table.

641
01:33:01,513 --> 01:33:11,777
We're going to vote on this evening to issue a permit to dig a trench to access the armory building and the same contingencies that we had just voted on for the prior paper would be in place.

642
01:33:11,897 --> 01:33:16,719
Any contingencies that are on the other plan will be held to this standard also.

643
01:33:17,379 --> 01:33:19,640
And did we vote on the B paper?

644
01:33:22,309 --> 01:33:26,693
I thought it was part of it.

645
01:33:27,895 --> 01:33:33,240
On the motion by Councilor Scott Peli, seconded by Councilor DelaRusso, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

646
01:33:35,923 --> 01:33:36,784
Councilor DelaRusso?

647
01:33:36,944 --> 01:33:37,264
Yea.

648
01:33:37,785 --> 01:33:38,485
Councilor Falcone?

649
01:33:38,525 --> 01:33:38,746
Yes.

650
01:33:39,246 --> 01:33:39,687
Councilor Night?

651
01:33:39,727 --> 01:33:40,047
Yes.

652
01:33:40,567 --> 01:33:41,348
Councilor Kern?

653
01:33:41,388 --> 01:33:41,649
Yes.

654
01:33:42,229 --> 01:33:42,950
Vice President Marks?

655
01:33:42,990 --> 01:33:43,310
Yes.

656
01:33:43,671 --> 01:33:44,371
Councilor Scott Peli?

657
01:33:44,451 --> 01:33:44,672
Yes.

658
01:33:46,961 --> 01:33:49,082
7 in the affirmative, none in the negative.

659
01:33:49,402 --> 01:33:50,862
Motion ordinance passes.

660
01:33:50,962 --> 01:33:51,242
Thank you.

661
01:33:51,262 --> 01:33:52,502
Mr. President, we're in suspension.

662
01:33:52,522 --> 01:33:54,223
Can we take communications from the mayor?

663
01:33:54,263 --> 01:33:54,503
Paper 17649.

664
01:33:54,803 --> 01:34:05,945
Motion by Councilor Knight to take 17649, communications from the mayor.

665
01:34:06,265 --> 01:34:08,526
All in favor?

666
01:34:09,146 --> 01:34:09,426
Aye.

667
01:34:09,546 --> 01:34:10,366
Motion passes.

668
01:34:11,380 --> 01:34:13,001
Yeah, Mr. President and councilors.

669
01:34:13,401 --> 01:34:16,363
Mr. President, motion to waive the reading and have a representative from the administration.

670
01:34:16,403 --> 01:34:17,724
Give us a brief synopsis of the paper.

671
01:34:18,064 --> 01:34:18,524
Thank you.

672
01:34:19,125 --> 01:34:22,527
Even though we can't see your daily address on the record.

673
01:34:23,448 --> 01:34:23,948
Thank you.

674
01:34:24,648 --> 01:34:26,529
Frank Gilbert, Fire Chief, City of Medford.

675
01:34:26,549 --> 01:34:30,712
On 26 May.

676
01:34:32,373 --> 01:34:35,355
The request before you this evening, Mr. President, is for a

677
01:34:43,868 --> 01:34:51,110
and we're asking to approve payment of those five invoices with this year's appropriation.

678
01:34:53,230 --> 01:34:54,551
The amount totaling $4,362.25.

679
01:34:54,631 --> 01:34:57,011
Move approval.

680
01:34:57,031 --> 01:34:59,832
Councilor Lococo.

681
01:35:00,152 --> 01:35:04,193
Just through the chair, what were the invoices specifically?

682
01:35:04,573 --> 01:35:05,034
I'm sorry.

683
01:35:05,074 --> 01:35:06,894
A breakdown of what the invoices were for.

684
01:35:08,034 --> 01:35:10,235
Overhead door repairs on various stations.

685
01:35:16,083 --> 01:35:16,363
Thank you.

686
01:35:16,763 --> 01:35:19,244
Mr. President, if I may.

687
01:35:19,264 --> 01:35:23,005
Chief, have those door issues been rectified in their entirety?

688
01:35:23,426 --> 01:35:26,907
Have there been new doors placed in, or is it more of a patchwork repair type of deal?

689
01:35:26,927 --> 01:35:28,887
These are all just repairs, just various items.

690
01:35:33,029 --> 01:35:42,752
And if I may, Chief, would you be comfortable this evening giving us an update on the status of the relocation search committee for the training tower?

691
01:35:43,533 --> 01:35:44,033
Not at all.

692
01:35:51,132 --> 01:35:58,577
I believe we're much closer to acquiring the property that I've requested behind the VFW.

693
01:35:58,657 --> 01:36:00,499
Okay, so you've identified a site.

694
01:36:01,019 --> 01:36:02,460
Yes, I've identified a site.

695
01:36:02,861 --> 01:36:03,701
I wrote to the mayor.

696
01:36:04,262 --> 01:36:14,169
The mayor passed that along to our state representative, Mr. Donato, and he's been in touch with MassDOT, and they seem to be very receptive to us.

697
01:36:16,279 --> 01:36:16,939
Thank you, sir.

698
01:36:17,299 --> 01:36:18,159
Excellent, excellent.

699
01:36:18,339 --> 01:36:19,240
Great, thank you very much.

700
01:36:19,260 --> 01:36:20,220
You've been done.

701
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:21,660
One other item I just want to follow up on.

702
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:23,320
The turnoff key, has that been issued?

703
01:36:23,860 --> 01:36:24,240
I'm sorry?

704
01:36:24,260 --> 01:36:26,661
The second set of turnoff key, or is the second set of turnoff key have been issued?

705
01:36:26,761 --> 01:36:28,061
We're just waiting for delivery.

706
01:36:28,461 --> 01:36:29,561
Waiting for delivery, OK.

707
01:36:30,081 --> 01:36:30,641
Thank you very much.

708
01:36:30,661 --> 01:36:31,382
You're welcome.

709
01:36:31,882 --> 01:36:32,762
Councilor Del Rosso.

710
01:36:34,602 --> 01:36:37,123
Chief, thank you for your leadership of the department.

711
01:36:37,883 --> 01:36:39,263
You're a man who gets things done.

712
01:36:39,643 --> 01:36:41,143
Thank you, Councilor Del Rosso.

713
01:36:41,403 --> 01:36:41,743
Thank you.

714
01:36:42,703 --> 01:36:43,404
Move approval, Mr. President.

715
01:36:43,424 --> 01:36:45,404
Move the motion by Councilor Layton, seconded by?

716
01:37:01,162 --> 01:37:03,204
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.

717
01:37:26,530 --> 01:37:30,432
Move to suspend the rules and take 17650, Mr. President.

718
01:37:30,732 --> 01:37:30,432
17650.

719
01:37:30,772 --> 01:37:40,078
Mr. President, motion to waive the reading and have a representative from the administration give a brief synopsis of the paper.

720
01:37:47,917 --> 01:37:48,838
Thank you, Mr. President.

721
01:37:48,858 --> 01:37:49,799
Good evening, councillors.

722
01:37:49,839 --> 01:37:55,865
I'm here tonight to request approval for a bill we have from Jamie Thompson Plumbing.

723
01:37:55,885 --> 01:37:59,308
We got his site at 38 Circus Street.

724
01:37:59,368 --> 01:38:06,054
He was called out in November of 2015 on two separate calls on an emergency basis.

725
01:38:06,855 --> 01:38:11,640
There was a two-family dwelling, first floor was vacant, and on the second floor,

726
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:22,063
A single mother with three children, they had no hot water, so he had to go out, place a hot water line and hook that up to the second floor water line to give them the hot water.

727
01:38:22,903 --> 01:38:28,945
The next night, this all occurred because of a sewage backup that went in the house, caused several other problems.

728
01:38:28,985 --> 01:38:30,685
And the next night, he had a no heat call.

729
01:38:31,105 --> 01:38:37,367
He had to go out and fire up the boiler and restart it so this woman and her young children could have heat.

730
01:38:38,207 --> 01:38:46,431
And the total amount on these bills that we're requesting payment for is $545 for the plumbing work he did at this site.

731
01:38:46,891 --> 01:38:47,232
Thank you.

732
01:38:47,912 --> 01:38:48,632
Council Member Kern.

733
01:38:48,652 --> 01:38:51,714
If I may, through the chair, thank you, President Carviello.

734
01:38:51,734 --> 01:38:53,294
You said the bills were from 2015.

735
01:38:53,555 --> 01:38:56,576
Is there a reason why it's taken so long?

736
01:38:57,076 --> 01:39:00,638
Yes, Council Member Kern, there was a reason why it took so long.

737
01:39:03,604 --> 01:39:30,621
to Hawaii, and during that time, we were in the process of contacting a management company, which took quite a while, and what ended up happening, we had to put a lien on the house, and it took several, after the lien was put on, the vendor took several months to give us his invoice, and then once we got the invoice, we had to wait another several months for the attorney that closed on the property to pay, to give us a check for the lien that we had placed on the property.

738
01:39:32,622 --> 01:39:32,803
Thank you.

739
01:39:32,823 --> 01:39:33,083
Mr. President?

740
01:39:35,041 --> 01:39:40,685
Mr. Moore, you said that the Thompson Plumbing Company went out to this site twice?

741
01:39:41,325 --> 01:39:42,806
Two separate occasions.

742
01:39:42,846 --> 01:39:44,787
And the total bill was only $545?

743
01:39:45,248 --> 01:39:45,528
Yes.

744
01:39:45,628 --> 01:39:46,288
That's quite a deal.

745
01:39:47,529 --> 01:39:50,031
Relatively speaking, it's a very good price, yes.

746
01:39:51,012 --> 01:39:52,112
Move approval, Mr. President.

747
01:39:52,693 --> 01:39:54,074
On the motion by Councillor Neill.

748
01:39:55,334 --> 01:39:57,596
Seconded by Councillor McLaren.

749
01:39:59,237 --> 01:40:00,118
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

750
01:40:04,902 --> 01:40:05,783
Councilor De La Rucia?

751
01:40:06,003 --> 01:40:06,323
Yes.

752
01:40:06,843 --> 01:40:07,564
Councilor Falco?

753
01:40:07,664 --> 01:40:07,884
Yes.

754
01:40:08,845 --> 01:40:09,365
Councilor Nait?

755
01:40:09,745 --> 01:40:09,966
Yes.

756
01:40:10,526 --> 01:40:11,286
Councilor McKernan?

757
01:40:11,407 --> 01:40:11,627
Yes.

758
01:40:12,187 --> 01:40:12,908
Vice President Martz?

759
01:40:13,008 --> 01:40:13,328
Yes.

760
01:40:13,748 --> 01:40:14,509
Councilor Scarpelli?

761
01:40:14,669 --> 01:40:14,989
Yes.

762
01:40:15,509 --> 01:40:16,210
President Caviello?

763
01:40:16,470 --> 01:40:16,810
Yes.

764
01:40:17,451 --> 01:40:19,652
Seven in the affirmative, nine in the negative.

765
01:40:20,093 --> 01:40:23,295
Motion passes.

766
01:40:23,315 --> 01:40:23,775
17-652.

767
01:40:24,276 --> 01:40:25,256
Mr. President, City Council.

768
01:40:25,276 --> 01:40:30,020
Mr. President, motion to waive the reading and have a representative from the administration give a brief synopsis on the paper.

769
01:40:30,040 --> 01:40:32,942
On the motion by Councilor Nait, do we have a representative from

770
01:40:34,396 --> 01:40:36,557
We can't say it's a little hard to see over there, so we can't say.

771
01:40:36,577 --> 01:40:38,759
Alicia Hunt and Roy Bilson.

772
01:40:38,819 --> 01:40:39,419
It's Alicia Hunt.

773
01:40:40,359 --> 01:40:40,680
Thank you.

774
01:40:40,720 --> 01:40:41,900
Name and address of the record, please.

775
01:40:43,621 --> 01:40:44,782
Sorry.

776
01:40:45,542 --> 01:40:46,603
Alicia Hunt, 41 Watson Street, Medford.

777
01:40:46,643 --> 01:40:47,504
So basically, this is, sorry.

778
01:40:53,643 --> 01:40:57,827
I expected to have it all read, so I am going to summarize it for you.

779
01:40:58,688 --> 01:41:03,092
This is a request for $348,336 from Free Cash, the information you typically request is there in the paper.

780
01:41:03,132 --> 01:41:07,116
The first $256,000 is to upgrade the lights at the Andrews School to controllable LED lights.

781
01:41:18,325 --> 01:41:22,207
This is a natural next step after the other work that we've done in the schools.

782
01:41:22,247 --> 01:41:26,529
You might be aware that last winter we did the Curtis Tops to LED lights interior.

783
01:41:27,049 --> 01:41:30,731
We did some of the hallways and some other LED light projects at the schools.

784
01:41:31,191 --> 01:41:33,653
This is the direction that the industry is moving.

785
01:41:34,013 --> 01:41:37,675
Our DPW was built with all LED lights as well.

786
01:41:39,335 --> 01:41:44,258
This particular project is being, I'm asking for this money to do this project at this time.

787
01:41:44,737 --> 01:41:53,440
because this will serve as the city's match to a grant the state that we and B2Q Consulting received from the state.

788
01:41:53,981 --> 01:41:57,122
So the lighting project on its own makes sense.

789
01:41:57,782 --> 01:42:00,723
It'll save the city about $22,000 a year.

790
01:42:01,423 --> 01:42:07,146
But if we do it at this time, we can use it as our share on this grant project.

791
01:42:07,766 --> 01:42:13,668
The grant is to do electricity peak demand reduction, and it's a pilot for the state.

792
01:42:14,375 --> 01:42:18,977
So basically, the state gave B2Q and the city money to work on this.

793
01:42:19,778 --> 01:42:23,580
The grant itself is $478,000.

794
01:42:24,600 --> 01:42:28,562
And as well, National Grid is very interested in how this would work.

795
01:42:28,722 --> 01:42:35,926
And they have committed $125,000 of technical assistance time on this specific project.

796
01:42:36,466 --> 01:42:40,648
And the project would actually run in the Andrews School and the DPW.

797
01:42:41,622 --> 01:42:59,657
We'll get additionally, they'll be upgrading the controls in the schools and the DPW to be able to control the lights in both of those buildings through our computer system, as well as doing additional upgrades to the heating and cooling system and their controls, how we run it, energy efficiency.

798
01:43:00,117 --> 01:43:04,180
It is also likely that we would get revenue from the demand response program.

799
01:43:04,621 --> 01:43:07,263
The amount of that revenue is very dependent on

800
01:43:07,843 --> 01:43:18,606
The whole process, we're still doing the feasibility part of it that determines how much electricity we would actually produce through these programs during peak demand time.

801
01:43:19,406 --> 01:43:20,406
That's one piece of it.

802
01:43:20,826 --> 01:43:35,450
The other part of the money is $83,000 that would serve as a match for another grant that we received from the Department of Energy Resources that would add battery and the ability to run solar off grid.

803
01:43:35,910 --> 01:43:38,091
to the DPW and the Andrews School.

804
01:43:38,231 --> 01:43:41,172
And as you know, we're in the process of putting solar on the DPWs.

805
01:43:41,212 --> 01:43:42,513
This adds battery to that.

806
01:43:42,573 --> 01:43:42,773
Excuse me.

807
01:43:43,373 --> 01:43:43,573
Yeah?

808
01:43:44,033 --> 01:43:45,634
Can you repeat the figure you just said?

809
01:43:46,094 --> 01:43:47,975
So which, OK.

810
01:43:48,015 --> 01:43:50,336
The amount awarded by the grant from the Department of Energy?

811
01:43:50,356 --> 01:43:52,477
So the first grant is $478,688.

812
01:43:52,517 --> 01:43:53,397
No, no.

813
01:43:54,337 --> 01:43:55,378
The second grant, I'm asking for $83,000.

814
01:44:03,503 --> 01:44:04,943
I can be more specific.

815
01:44:04,963 --> 01:44:06,244
$83,336 serves as a match.

816
01:44:06,264 --> 01:44:07,264
It is 10% of the grant amount.

817
01:44:07,364 --> 01:44:08,704
Hold on a second.

818
01:44:08,724 --> 01:44:09,765
Because we have it as $833,000.

819
01:44:09,805 --> 01:44:10,585
No, the grant is $833,000.

820
01:44:10,625 --> 01:44:12,625
Yes, so the grant is an $833,000 and change grant.

821
01:44:12,685 --> 01:44:16,186
And so our match is 10% that we need to have in hand as we begin the project.

822
01:44:31,501 --> 01:44:37,344
So battery is very, very expensive to pair with solar, and we believe it's a good idea.

823
01:44:37,364 --> 01:45:00,755
It'll allow us to run these buildings off grid when the electricity is down, and the grant will pay for this battery that would go with both the solar systems, the one we're in the process of, and the one that is planned at the, that will be coming eventually, our future, we have to redo the roof at the Andrews School before we come forward with a solid proposal on solar for that building.

824
01:45:01,260 --> 01:45:03,141
So that's the whole package altogether.

825
01:45:03,841 --> 01:45:04,162
Thank you.

826
01:45:04,482 --> 01:45:04,942
Mr. President.

827
01:45:05,382 --> 01:45:05,903
Counselor Falco.

828
01:45:06,243 --> 01:45:07,583
Thank you, Mr. President.

829
01:45:07,603 --> 01:45:10,265
And thank you for this report, Ms.

830
01:45:10,285 --> 01:45:12,506
Hunt and Superintendent Pendleton.

831
01:45:13,066 --> 01:45:15,708
I think this is a great opportunity, and I think it's a great program.

832
01:45:15,748 --> 01:45:20,230
And I'm glad to see that we're getting grant funding for this type of project.

833
01:45:20,330 --> 01:45:28,755
Can you talk a little bit about the impact on the schools with regard to when this project will take place and how the students will be impacted?

834
01:45:29,529 --> 01:45:37,574
Right, so the lighting project, it would be our intention to do it second shift, so they would be in there 3 p.m.

835
01:45:37,654 --> 01:45:38,674
to 11 p.m.

836
01:45:38,834 --> 01:45:40,215
in order to do that piece of it.

837
01:45:41,616 --> 01:45:46,118
Solar, if and when we are able, so we'll need to do a new roof and solar.

838
01:45:46,959 --> 01:45:49,821
My hope is that we could get something lined up for next summer.

839
01:45:51,008 --> 01:45:53,969
But that is still the chunk to come.

840
01:45:54,449 --> 01:46:02,030
The battery piece of it would actually be completely out of the way in the back area, not where students are.

841
01:46:02,310 --> 01:46:07,931
There's a separate entrance into the electrical rooms where we have generators and HVAC equipment.

842
01:46:08,411 --> 01:46:16,772
So the contractors, when they do do work, could work in that area without ever having to go into the main portion of the building.

843
01:46:17,292 --> 01:46:19,813
Or they could go in through the main portion, check in with the

844
01:46:20,813 --> 01:46:30,141
with the security, but then they would just traverse through the building and be in that back area and never have to actually be in student areas.

845
01:46:30,161 --> 01:46:34,945
I also know the superintendent is here to speak to some of this as well.

846
01:46:35,505 --> 01:46:38,207
If I may, what would be the duration of the project?

847
01:46:38,227 --> 01:46:41,070
How long would it take to replace all the lights?

848
01:46:41,963 --> 01:46:42,823
A couple of weeks.

849
01:46:43,364 --> 01:46:46,665
So I will tell you that this is a large project, so it would have to be bid out.

850
01:46:47,085 --> 01:46:51,787
And part of the bidding out process is to ask the contractors, you know, how long will it take?

851
01:46:51,887 --> 01:46:56,129
Because some contractors will put one crew on and do it over many weeks.

852
01:46:56,589 --> 01:47:00,851
Other contractors will say, I have 10 crews, and I'll get it done in three days.

853
01:47:01,271 --> 01:47:07,033
So because it's going to be a project that would be bid out, I cannot tell you now.

854
01:47:07,834 --> 01:47:11,435
And I can't bid it out until we're at that stage of the project.

855
01:47:11,977 --> 01:47:13,998
is when we would have to schedule.

856
01:47:14,199 --> 01:47:23,485
Mr. Superintendent, it sounds like there could be some workers in the building while the students are there, while the workers be quarried and whatnot.

857
01:47:24,826 --> 01:47:35,673
If there is any time in which a worker is in the building, that worker would be quarried, even if he's working second shift, because there are programs that run in the afternoons.

858
01:47:36,333 --> 01:47:41,617
So we would quarry anyone that might have the opportunity to be unsupervised with young people.

859
01:47:42,508 --> 01:47:45,512
make sure that we're doing everything we can.

860
01:47:45,532 --> 01:47:48,216
It's a pretty big project.

861
01:47:48,236 --> 01:47:51,641
There'll be a lot of people in the building, so just want to make sure we're protecting our students.

862
01:47:51,661 --> 01:47:52,342
So, thank you.

863
01:47:58,589 --> 01:47:59,550
Thank you, Mr. President.

864
01:48:00,890 --> 01:48:17,620
Alicia, regarding the paired battery storage, will we be able to accept additional electricity from the current windmill and also provide that to the battery storage?

865
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:27,285
The wind turbine is actually connected to the McGlynn School, not the Andrews School, so it would not be connected to this battery.

866
01:48:28,398 --> 01:48:30,921
Right, but we couldn't connect one to the other.

867
01:48:30,981 --> 01:48:32,763
I mean, the schools are on the same property, right?

868
01:48:45,327 --> 01:48:54,509
The wind turbine doesn't make as much electricity compared to what a solar installation does to make it worth the amount of electrical work you would have to do to do that.

869
01:48:54,910 --> 01:49:01,371
There'd also be a lot of changes to the control system in order to take in that separate, very different input.

870
01:49:05,203 --> 01:49:12,805
I hope that at some point in the future we'd be able to do a similar project at the McGlynn School, and at which point we would have the wind turbine.

871
01:49:12,865 --> 01:49:18,086
We would also have the benefit of having done this project at the Andrew School first.

872
01:49:19,206 --> 01:49:19,586
Thank you.

873
01:49:22,027 --> 01:49:22,287
Thank you.

874
01:49:22,307 --> 01:49:23,247
Mr. President.

875
01:49:23,607 --> 01:49:23,947
Thank you.

876
01:49:23,967 --> 01:49:24,447
Mr. President.

877
01:49:25,427 --> 01:49:25,548
Ms.

878
01:49:26,428 --> 01:49:28,208
Hunt, thank you very much for your work.

879
01:49:28,328 --> 01:49:31,909
I'm looking at this paper and reading what it says.

880
01:49:33,218 --> 01:49:41,546
grant for this, grant for that, grant for this, and I know that those grants didn't write themselves, and I think that you deserve a lot of credit for going out there and finding the money.

881
01:49:42,047 --> 01:49:44,108
So thank you very much for your effort.

882
01:49:44,549 --> 01:49:50,515
In looking at this paper, I mean, we have $265,000 to upgrade the LED lights at the Andrews.

883
01:49:51,295 --> 01:49:55,499
My math, as spooky as it is, would come back and show that we have about

884
01:49:56,080 --> 01:49:57,441
12-year return on our investment.

885
01:49:58,221 --> 01:50:06,207
We're going to save about $22,000 a year if we convert to the LED lighting, and we'll be able to capture this investment within a period of about 12 years.

886
01:50:07,268 --> 01:50:09,469
I also understand that this $83,000 is a 10% match on the battery, correct?

887
01:50:09,489 --> 01:50:09,690
Right.

888
01:50:09,750 --> 01:50:12,171
And if you add the $265,000 and the $83,000, we come up with a figure of $348,000.

889
01:50:20,738 --> 01:50:22,900
So this appropriations are $348,000, but we're also looking at $100,000 grant.

890
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:23,221
A $478,000 grant?

891
01:50:23,261 --> 01:50:23,321
Yes.

892
01:50:23,341 --> 01:50:23,521
A $125,000 grant?

893
01:50:23,541 --> 01:50:23,741
So the $100,000 is

894
01:50:37,340 --> 01:50:39,561
There are two different numbers from National Grid.

895
01:50:39,761 --> 01:50:43,504
One is an incentive for the lighting.

896
01:50:43,564 --> 01:50:49,707
So the lighting project is actually more expensive than this, so that comes in to offset the cost of the lighting.

897
01:50:50,428 --> 01:51:05,697
And the other is that National Grid will put technical assistance in to this project, which honestly, I feel is very notable that they've actually said that this project is interesting enough to them that they want to put that much of their own technical time

898
01:51:06,077 --> 01:51:08,078
which is a project to make this work.

899
01:51:09,559 --> 01:51:13,962
But it's the equivalent of $125,000 in national grid time.

900
01:51:14,242 --> 01:51:14,482
Okay.

901
01:51:15,163 --> 01:51:24,409
So, and looking at all the grant money or the matching funds that have been awarded to the city, how much money are we talking here?

902
01:51:26,770 --> 01:51:29,212
I have not done that math.

903
01:51:29,932 --> 01:51:31,473
So, but we're looking at like 833 and 478, so that's,

904
01:51:34,451 --> 01:51:42,756
close to one plus the $100,000, on the order of $1.3 million of money that'll be coming into city buildings.

905
01:51:42,836 --> 01:51:49,620
So this evening you're asking for us to make an investment of $348,000 so that we can get a return on that investment of over a million dollars?

906
01:51:49,920 --> 01:51:50,080
Yes.

907
01:51:50,441 --> 01:51:51,961
I'm comfortable voting for this this evening.

908
01:51:52,122 --> 01:51:54,383
Thank you very much for your work, Mr. President, and for approval.

909
01:51:56,204 --> 01:51:56,964
Council Member Kern.

910
01:51:57,044 --> 01:51:58,445
Thank you, President Carviello.

911
01:51:58,725 --> 01:52:00,026
Ms.

912
01:52:00,066 --> 01:52:02,928
Huntwell, we have you before us, and we're talking about the Andrews School.

913
01:52:03,453 --> 01:52:11,958
Can you give us an update on the test borings that were done very close to there and whether or not they were done behind the Andrews School, any results that may be coming back?

914
01:52:12,298 --> 01:52:20,943
Right, so I do believe that there is a response in your packets that is from the motion prior about that.

915
01:52:21,003 --> 01:52:22,984
I'm happy to speak to it for a minute or two.

916
01:52:25,275 --> 01:52:31,156
I don't have the response that went to you in front of me, but we did the test scoring.

917
01:52:31,757 --> 01:52:38,718
We found that there were two locations that had very high levels deep down.

918
01:52:38,758 --> 01:52:46,940
One was, gosh, my brain is gonna stop on that, lead, and the other was very unusual, like, threw me for a loop.

919
01:52:46,960 --> 01:52:49,361
I believe it was zinc, is that right, that's in there?

920
01:52:50,321 --> 01:52:53,022
And I didn't even know prior that it could be contaminating.

921
01:52:54,017 --> 01:53:07,267
And so those two locations, we need to do, so we did testing in the grid, and two spots showed up with high levels, and now we need to, oh, thank you.

922
01:53:07,287 --> 01:53:08,828
I really appreciate that.

923
01:53:11,798 --> 01:53:13,400
I did not refresh myself on it.

924
01:53:15,942 --> 01:53:16,623
Yes, zinc.

925
01:53:17,663 --> 01:53:20,106
Sorry, it's such an odd thing.

926
01:53:20,206 --> 01:53:25,811
I was not aware that zinc at a high level could be a soil contaminant until we got involved in this project.

927
01:53:25,851 --> 01:53:27,693
So I always question myself when I say that.

928
01:53:29,101 --> 01:53:41,028
So those two spots are very high and actually either have to be removed or we have to do extensive room reporting and testing to the state that would be extremely costly to removing those areas.

929
01:53:41,609 --> 01:53:55,198
So we need to do testing around those locations to find out exactly so we know where there is a problem and we know these areas where there isn't and we want to test in closer to see how small of an area can we deal with.

930
01:53:55,658 --> 01:53:57,079
So it might be that we put

931
01:53:57,483 --> 01:54:06,485
you know, a bench and a paved area and a bench over the zinc location, or it may be that we dig a hole and dig it out.

932
01:54:06,905 --> 01:54:11,967
And we need to, in order to do one of those things, do a little bit more testing to understand those locations.

933
01:54:13,087 --> 01:54:15,988
We haven't yet tested on the other side of the sidewalk.

934
01:54:17,469 --> 01:54:26,536
The lead level is actually very close to the sidewalk, and so as part of narrowing that, we are going to need to go on the other side of the sidewalk and do that testing.

935
01:54:27,236 --> 01:54:33,481
But we've sort of been waiting to get it all done at the same time and not do that separately.

936
01:54:34,342 --> 01:54:39,506
There were two areas that had petroleum and PCBs, which we also have to do some further

937
01:54:41,407 --> 01:54:42,608
to understand.

938
01:54:42,628 --> 01:54:52,875
The other thing that was notable that I mentioned in here, one of the other properties, they have had a problem with their groundwater that they are very aware of.

939
01:54:53,436 --> 01:55:04,744
And one of the questions that had come up to me, and what prompted this testing partially in part was, was this problem in the groundwater under our property?

940
01:55:05,164 --> 01:55:07,846
And we did not find any of that under our property.

941
01:55:09,553 --> 01:55:15,681
So additionally, some of the area within the fence belongs to the Department of Conservation and Recreation, DCR.

942
01:55:16,823 --> 01:55:18,385
That area has been delineated.

943
01:55:18,665 --> 01:55:23,011
We have not been doing testing on that area, but we are in close contact with them.

944
01:55:23,031 --> 01:55:25,234
I, in fact, discussed that.

945
01:55:25,835 --> 01:55:42,100
with them today, and they're very interested in working with us to be able to do a solution that provides safety and protection to everybody, but is as minimal expense and actually impact to the area as possible.

946
01:55:42,740 --> 01:55:52,743
And with their extensive experience in these sorts of problems, I think we're going to be able to do things a little bit better because they're going to be a partner with us on this.

947
01:55:53,786 --> 01:55:55,408
Thank you very much for the update.

948
01:55:55,428 --> 01:55:56,829
We do have it in our packet.

949
01:55:57,810 --> 01:56:02,034
There are a number of parents that have been asking me questions, you know, so I wanted you to state it publicly.

950
01:56:02,455 --> 01:56:08,941
And just so I have it clearly after reading it and after your explanation, test pourings were done at the clippership part section.

951
01:56:09,722 --> 01:56:10,943
The lead and the zinc were found.

952
01:56:11,279 --> 01:56:20,886
but there will be, as requested by the council, there will be some pourings on the other side of the walkway, which is behind Andrews, where the children play soccer and whatnot.

953
01:56:20,986 --> 01:56:25,449
Right, so I do not anticipate that we would go up onto the soccer field.

954
01:56:25,830 --> 01:56:29,953
We were able to find the records, so when those schools were built,

955
01:56:30,557 --> 01:56:38,844
They found arsenic in that area, and the area was low enough that they were legally allowed to close the site without doing anything.

956
01:56:39,365 --> 01:56:44,989
But they came in and put clean fill over that whole area, but it was

957
01:56:46,050 --> 01:56:56,181
after the fact that the area was closed with the state as being acceptable as is, but then the city came in and put the clean fill on anyhow.

958
01:56:56,701 --> 01:57:08,293
So the records on that and exactly the locations are a little different, but it's pretty clear to the eye that where the soccer field raises up is part of that area with the clean fill on top.

959
01:57:08,812 --> 01:57:11,174
and which makes us very comfortable about that area.

960
01:57:11,514 --> 01:57:19,799
And it's just the part that slopes down to the pathway where you might say, well, that doesn't look like there's clean fill on there.

961
01:57:20,280 --> 01:57:23,042
And so that's where some of these borings are going to be.

962
01:57:23,462 --> 01:57:29,226
And then can you just lastly just give us a time frame so we know when to request an update?

963
01:57:29,946 --> 01:57:30,186
Right.

964
01:57:31,600 --> 01:57:35,441
So I'm hoping to do that over the next four to six weeks.

965
01:57:35,921 --> 01:57:41,723
Some of it is scheduling with the equipment that is necessary to do that.

966
01:57:43,384 --> 01:57:44,624
And finalizing it all.

967
01:57:44,644 --> 01:57:45,325
We've been waiting.

968
01:57:45,345 --> 01:57:48,986
Honestly, our point of contract at the state

969
01:57:49,566 --> 01:58:00,075
The Environmental Protection Office has been out for three weeks on leave, and we really wanted him to see our most recent report and discuss it with him, and he returned from leave yesterday.

970
01:58:00,095 --> 01:58:06,941
So before I schedule the borings, I do want to review with him the results of our

971
01:58:18,540 --> 01:58:19,340
Move approval.

972
01:58:20,641 --> 01:58:22,001
Thank you for following up on that.

973
01:58:22,862 --> 01:58:24,722
I appreciate it.

974
01:58:24,782 --> 01:58:25,603
It's you.

975
01:58:25,823 --> 01:58:26,463
Wow.

976
01:58:27,363 --> 01:58:27,883
It's zinc.

977
01:58:28,184 --> 01:58:33,826
It's zinc.

978
01:58:35,826 --> 01:58:36,186
Thank you.

979
01:58:36,227 --> 01:58:37,687
My colleague asked the questions.

980
01:58:37,727 --> 01:58:38,307
Thank you very much.

981
01:58:38,427 --> 01:58:40,948
Move approval, Mr. President.

982
01:58:40,968 --> 01:58:43,149
On the motion by Councillor— Second.

983
01:58:43,729 --> 01:58:45,250
Seconded by Councillor— Mr. President.

984
01:58:45,958 --> 01:58:46,638
Vice President Mox.

985
01:58:46,718 --> 01:58:54,262
Just if we could, if we can also, while we have Alicia here, if you can give us just a brief update on where we stand with the lighting in the square.

986
01:58:55,823 --> 01:59:15,032
So, the lighting of the square has been folded in with our larger city lighting project, and I actually spoke with our consultants at Lantham, oh my gosh, on Monday, yesterday, about the history of those lights, what are in those various fixtures, what we're looking for,

987
01:59:16,155 --> 01:59:27,359
Based on what I've said and the observations, and I'd love feedback, but my impression is that most people are happy with the light levels at the Peace Garden.

988
01:59:27,839 --> 01:59:30,480
Those are the same fixtures, but much brighter.

989
01:59:31,240 --> 01:59:37,282
And so I believe that we'll be able, through this project, to install equivalent

990
01:59:39,006 --> 01:59:42,873
light bulbs, basically, from what's in the Peace Garden into the square.

991
01:59:42,893 --> 01:59:52,329
For technical reasons, under an energy efficiency project, I could never put those in because it would be increasing the electricity that's used.

992
01:59:53,318 --> 01:59:58,961
And that would fall outside of any kind of grant money I could do, or I would have to put that out to bid.

993
01:59:59,541 --> 02:00:04,143
Under our larger lighting project, it's probably the right thing to do.

994
02:00:04,183 --> 02:00:08,685
And that will increase the electricity usage on those lights.

995
02:00:09,085 --> 02:00:13,567
But at this point, I think most people would agree that's the right thing to do.

996
02:00:13,587 --> 02:00:19,189
And we'll be decreasing the light, the electricity usage throughout the rest of the city.

997
02:00:19,997 --> 02:00:25,038
So that is our tentative plan, and I've asked them to get me that information.

998
02:00:25,501 --> 02:00:31,265
concretely as quickly as possible to move that forward faster than the main project.

999
02:00:31,545 --> 02:00:42,772
But I'm not sure what the timing on that would be and whether there's an appetite for coming forward with a request for just that chunk of money separate from the main lighting project.

1000
02:00:43,652 --> 02:00:45,934
Originally, it started off as a standalone project.

1001
02:00:46,054 --> 02:00:46,914
Yes, it did.

1002
02:00:46,934 --> 02:00:52,298
And we were trying to make it an energy efficiency project that we could procure through energy

1003
02:00:53,599 --> 02:01:01,085
through the Green Communities Act at the state level and you can't do it in an energy-efficient manner and fix the light levels there.

1004
02:01:02,606 --> 02:01:03,567
Thank you.

1005
02:01:04,488 --> 02:01:05,148
On the motion.

1006
02:01:07,010 --> 02:01:09,372
Mr. Klick, please call the roll.

1007
02:01:09,412 --> 02:01:09,532
Yes.

1008
02:01:09,552 --> 02:01:09,732
Yes.

1009
02:01:09,772 --> 02:01:09,932
Yes.

1010
02:01:09,972 --> 02:01:10,212
Yes.

1011
02:01:10,673 --> 02:01:10,953
Yes.

1012
02:01:20,910 --> 02:01:24,313
Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 9 in the negative.

1013
02:01:24,653 --> 02:01:25,534
Motion passed.

1014
02:01:25,574 --> 02:01:27,475
Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, if I could.

1015
02:01:27,495 --> 02:01:30,857
There's a gentleman that would like to speak.

1016
02:01:30,878 --> 02:01:34,961
There's this one person that would like to speak on his street.

1017
02:01:35,001 --> 02:01:38,043
It would be two minutes because the other topic is going to take a long time.

1018
02:01:49,859 --> 02:01:53,681
Uh, on the motion by council marks, that's on the rules.

1019
02:01:54,221 --> 02:01:55,441
We're already on the suspension, right?

1020
02:01:55,581 --> 02:01:55,861
Uh, no.

1021
02:01:55,921 --> 02:01:57,602
All right.

1022
02:01:59,503 --> 02:02:00,563
Name and address the record, please.

1023
02:02:02,604 --> 02:02:03,644
Thank you, Mr. President.

1024
02:02:03,965 --> 02:02:06,225
Robert Capucci, 71 Evans street.

1025
02:02:06,686 --> 02:02:17,530
And, uh, unfortunately I'm here again to address this council on the matter of, of the upkeep of, of Evans street, uh, spoken to for years about it at the council chambers.

1026
02:02:18,157 --> 02:02:28,444
at the last meeting across the courtyard, and here I am in the little theater addressing you again tonight, and I really hope to God this is the last time.

1027
02:02:30,626 --> 02:02:38,471
The last meeting, this council informed me, which I then informed my neighbors on Evans Street, that Evans Street wasn't on the list.

1028
02:02:39,072 --> 02:02:43,475
And then we came to find out that that was a miscommunication, that Evans Street was on the list.

1029
02:02:44,397 --> 02:02:53,879
And DPW workers came to Evans Street, and they mapped out with colored spray paint the water pipes on Evans Street that are going to be replaced.

1030
02:02:54,659 --> 02:03:04,141
And we were told, a friend of mine, one of my neighbors, Shauna Smith, has a friend in DPW who told her that work would begin on September 11th.

1031
02:03:04,721 --> 02:03:06,321
It's September 19th.

1032
02:03:06,441 --> 02:03:07,501
The work hasn't begun.

1033
02:03:08,201 --> 02:03:11,462
So my friend Shauna went on C-Click Fixed Sunday night.

1034
02:03:12,122 --> 02:03:18,166
to report to the city that Evans Street is one big pothole.

1035
02:03:18,826 --> 02:03:29,953
We come to find out there that the work wasn't started on September 11th, as promised, because the work order was assigned to the science department.

1036
02:03:32,281 --> 02:03:37,966
Terrible incompetence on the behalf of this mayoral administration, or it's on purpose.

1037
02:03:38,406 --> 02:03:41,529
We are at our wit's end on Evans Street.

1038
02:03:41,989 --> 02:03:49,375
And this is the proper format, I think, for the current mayoral administration, because it's all an act.

1039
02:03:49,696 --> 02:03:50,997
We're frustrated.

1040
02:03:51,397 --> 02:03:52,258
on Edmond Street.

1041
02:03:52,498 --> 02:03:53,539
Thank you, Mr. President.

1042
02:03:53,819 --> 02:03:54,200
Thank you.

1043
02:03:54,260 --> 02:03:55,521
Point of order, Mr. President.

1044
02:03:55,701 --> 02:03:57,363
Point of order, Councillor Del Rosso.

1045
02:03:57,383 --> 02:04:02,607
I wish that caution would be given as to making disparaging remarks.

1046
02:04:03,008 --> 02:04:04,289
Thank you, Councillor Del Rosso.

1047
02:04:05,167 --> 02:04:06,948
Mr. President, if I can address that.

1048
02:04:07,889 --> 02:04:23,300
It's disparaging for 30 houses on Evans Street to be paying taxes for the last 67 years in the tune of millions of dollars and not have proper basic services done for the residents of Evans Street.

1049
02:04:23,420 --> 02:04:24,681
That's disparaging.

1050
02:04:24,761 --> 02:04:25,761
Thank you, Mr. President.

1051
02:04:25,821 --> 02:04:26,422
Thank you.

1052
02:04:27,162 --> 02:04:29,004
We could just get an update through the chair on

1053
02:04:29,925 --> 02:04:33,466
What is the latest status of Evans Street?

1054
02:04:33,947 --> 02:04:35,527
Several weeks since we.

1055
02:04:36,127 --> 02:04:40,589
Resolution by Councilor Locario that we get an update on the status of Evans Street.

1056
02:04:42,350 --> 02:04:43,110
All those in favor.

1057
02:04:44,290 --> 02:04:44,971
Aye.

1058
02:04:45,831 --> 02:04:46,491
Motion passes.

1059
02:04:48,092 --> 02:04:51,893
Motion by Councilor Locario to take paper seven.

1060
02:05:02,639 --> 02:05:06,761
17, 5, 9, 0, 17, 5, 9, 0, off the table.

1061
02:05:07,721 --> 02:05:09,161
Motion to take that off the table.

1062
02:05:10,482 --> 02:05:12,183
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

1063
02:05:12,323 --> 02:05:15,304
All in favor, aye.

1064
02:05:15,444 --> 02:05:15,564
Aye.

1065
02:05:15,584 --> 02:05:19,965
17, 5, 9, 0, special permit hours for the Meadow Glen Mall Awakements.

1066
02:05:20,545 --> 02:05:24,627
Do we have a representative from Awakements here this evening to make a presentation?

1067
02:05:40,439 --> 02:05:40,799
Good evening.

1068
02:05:40,819 --> 02:05:42,120
Name and address of the record, please.

1069
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:44,401
Good evening, Mr. Council President.

1070
02:05:44,421 --> 02:05:46,302
Brian Dugdale from Goulston and Storrs.

1071
02:05:47,223 --> 02:05:51,225
Here on behalf of Medford Associates LLC, an affiliate of New England Development, owner of Medford.

1072
02:05:52,205 --> 02:05:54,046
And do we have a representative from Wakeman's here also?

1073
02:05:54,767 --> 02:05:55,527
We do.

1074
02:05:55,547 --> 02:05:56,828
Mr. Art Perez.

1075
02:05:57,188 --> 02:06:01,650
Good evening, Mr. President, members of the council.

1076
02:06:01,710 --> 02:06:03,191
Art Perez, Wakeman's Food Markets.

1077
02:06:04,612 --> 02:06:06,533
And do you have a presentation you'd like to make this evening?

1078
02:06:08,533 --> 02:06:09,254
We do, yes.

1079
02:06:09,394 --> 02:06:10,995
And then we'll start off with Mr. Dougdown.

1080
02:06:11,335 --> 02:06:11,475
OK.

1081
02:06:11,835 --> 02:06:12,136
Thank you.

1082
02:06:15,098 --> 02:06:15,518
Good evening.

1083
02:06:15,538 --> 02:06:17,599
Thank you, Mr. Council President and councillors.

1084
02:06:18,680 --> 02:06:23,243
My name is Brian Dugdale, again from Wilson and Storrs, on behalf of the owner of the Meadow Glen Mall.

1085
02:06:24,123 --> 02:06:29,167
We're here in connection with a request for extended hours at the mall, which is located in the city's industrial zoning district.

1086
02:06:30,075 --> 02:06:39,499
We have a detailed application on the record that goes through in detail each of the criteria for a special permit and how this request meets that criteria.

1087
02:06:39,519 --> 02:06:50,283
So what I'd like to do is just give a very quick introduction before Art from Wegmans comes back up and to give his explanation about Wegmans, its request, and to answer any questions the council might have.

1088
02:06:51,183 --> 02:06:55,885
So this request, which is to extend by just one hour in the morning and one hour in the evening,

1089
02:06:56,602 --> 02:07:00,224
was submitted in connection with substantial rehabilitation of the Meadow Glen Mall.

1090
02:07:01,105 --> 02:07:16,814
New England Development is extremely excited that this fall we'll be bringing forward not only Wegmans, but also Petco, Dick's Sporting Goods to support the existing coals and marshals that are located at the Meadow Glen Mall today.

1091
02:07:18,922 --> 02:07:20,404
New England Development is very excited.

1092
02:07:20,645 --> 02:07:25,452
The whole purpose of that redevelopment project was to bring forward tenants of the highest quality.

1093
02:07:25,512 --> 02:07:31,501
And Wegmans, if anybody's been to a Wegmans, you know that that supermarket is really top of the industry.

1094
02:07:32,506 --> 02:07:44,512
So we came before the city council on August 15th, at which time we were instructed to engage in further discussions with our immediately abutting neighbors to the east, the Mystic River Park condominiums.

1095
02:07:45,192 --> 02:07:51,995
We immediately engaged with the condo and had what we believe turned out to be productive conversations.

1096
02:07:53,096 --> 02:08:14,990
NED, together with Wegmans, as part of those discussions committed to do, that we heard their concerns about overnight loading, in particular, at evening hours, so New England Development and Wegmans committed to no overnight loading, sealed loading docks, a landscape buffer, fencing, and other funds for the condo to put even more landscape buffering on their side of the property.

1097
02:08:16,328 --> 02:08:25,653
In addition, there will be protocols for security and a designated representative at the shopping center to handle any concerns from any of the residents of the condo or otherwise.

1098
02:08:26,873 --> 02:08:35,337
So we're confident that the community overall, as well as our neighbors, are going to be happy with the changes that have come to fruition here at the Meadowlawn Mall.

1099
02:08:35,778 --> 02:08:37,058
And we're very excited to have Whiteman.

1100
02:08:37,078 --> 02:08:39,839
So with that, I'd like to turn it over to Mr. Perez.

1101
02:08:40,320 --> 02:08:40,600
Thank you.

1102
02:08:45,663 --> 02:08:46,344
Thank you, Brian.

1103
02:08:46,564 --> 02:08:57,693
As Mr. Dundale just presented, we're here for the application, once again, for extension of the hours of operation, specifically the special use permit modification on that.

1104
02:08:58,353 --> 02:09:01,936
And with that, currently it's allowed, as the council knows, 7 AM to 11 PM.

1105
02:09:03,377 --> 02:09:15,744
With consideration of the weather in the Northeast, of the states here obviously, as well as the traffic in the area, we're seeking an extension on either end by simply one hour.

1106
02:09:15,904 --> 02:09:18,025
That being allowing 6 a.m.

1107
02:09:18,386 --> 02:09:20,867
till midnight hours of operation.

1108
02:09:21,367 --> 02:09:25,470
Hours of operation meaning allowing the store to be open for the public.

1109
02:09:26,533 --> 02:09:41,078
With that, understanding and speaking to the residents, more specifically the residents of Mystic Condos right behind us, as noted by the council on the 815th, the question I think was raised, have we reached out?

1110
02:09:41,478 --> 02:09:45,800
And in fact, we had reached out and had communications prior to that to a representative of the condo.

1111
02:09:46,540 --> 02:09:50,662
As of today, we've had conversations with representative of the condo.

1112
02:09:51,442 --> 02:10:10,557
recognizing their adjacent neighbors, being a good neighbor, and in the culture of a community partner, both on the business level, where we've reached out, even as of recent of August 15th, we've invited and had a special meeting with local leaders of the community, the school superintendent, United Way Food Bank,

1113
02:10:11,277 --> 02:10:16,138
food bank, et cetera, recognizing that we are part of the community.

1114
02:10:16,278 --> 02:10:26,500
We are in this fine community and are very respectful for that and are involved across the board.

1115
02:10:26,860 --> 02:10:32,481
So as we are engaged with the community through the community leaders, we are also respective of our neighbors.

1116
02:10:32,881 --> 02:10:38,902
Therefore, the reach out, once again, prior to the August 15th and up as of late yesterday.

1117
02:10:39,822 --> 02:10:50,565
And as Mr. Dugdale noted, we will self-restrict overnight deliveries, mimicking the hours of operations for the board to grant the application request.

1118
02:10:50,685 --> 02:10:54,026
With that, I'd be glad to address any questions from the council.

1119
02:10:55,167 --> 02:10:55,907
Councilwoman O'Connor.

1120
02:10:56,307 --> 02:10:58,388
Thank you, Councilor Carviello.

1121
02:10:58,468 --> 02:11:08,691
If you or Brian could go over the no overnight loading deliveries, scaled loading, landscaping, if you just could go into more detail.

1122
02:11:09,412 --> 02:11:23,741
Because the only complaints or questions that I've received from the residents that live behind there are worries about overnight deliveries, the noise, obviously, how the property looks.

1123
02:11:24,201 --> 02:11:25,862
But other than that, I really haven't.

1124
02:11:26,002 --> 02:11:27,943
I want to just make sure those are addressed.

1125
02:11:27,963 --> 02:11:30,605
If you could just give hours in regards to those.

1126
02:11:30,625 --> 02:11:32,606
So it's very simplistic here again.

1127
02:11:34,130 --> 02:11:48,880
The application, and that's the beauty of it, currently 7-11 store operations allowing our customers to come into the store with consideration of many families have two of the adults working in the family, school activities.

1128
02:11:51,101 --> 02:11:57,888
And just a desire to get into the store and do shopping on the way to work or after work and allows them that flexibility.

1129
02:11:58,489 --> 02:12:01,852
So here again, the key point is hours of operations of the store.

1130
02:12:02,693 --> 02:12:12,202
Tied in with that, we will self-restrict out of consideration to the neighbors and not have tractor trailer deliveries at the rear of the store from midnight till 6 a.m.

1131
02:12:12,222 --> 02:12:12,683
in the morning.

1132
02:12:14,458 --> 02:12:30,106
As far as the property here again, New England Development has committed to, as evidenced by Mr. Dugdale's statements there, that they are committed to a number of additional landscaping treatments at the rear of the store, the property line, the fencing.

1133
02:12:30,806 --> 02:12:35,269
including access across the driveway to the condo development.

1134
02:12:35,849 --> 02:12:39,172
As far as the site overall itself, I think that speaks for itself.

1135
02:12:39,312 --> 02:12:46,176
As Mr. Dugtel had made presentation, it's a very beautiful upgrade from what the development had been.

1136
02:12:47,677 --> 02:12:49,579
I hope that addresses your question.

1137
02:12:50,439 --> 02:12:51,160
Vice President Maxt.

1138
02:12:52,667 --> 02:12:53,648
Thank you, Mr President.

1139
02:12:54,048 --> 02:13:00,332
And by no way am I speaking on behalf of the residents of Mr Condos.

1140
02:13:00,912 --> 02:13:09,457
However, the phone calls that I received from residents mainly were regarding the deliveries.

1141
02:13:10,598 --> 02:13:18,543
And there's roughly 132 units that directly face the rear of your establishment.

1142
02:13:20,319 --> 02:13:28,824
And I would say within approximately 200 feet from the rear of where deliveries will take place, give or take.

1143
02:13:29,905 --> 02:13:44,254
And I think the concern that I've been hearing from residents is, and I appreciate the fact that you're saying no overnights, but when a truck rolls up at 11, 11.30, quarter or 12, to me, that's a late hour.

1144
02:13:45,075 --> 02:13:46,696
Or when it rolls up at 6 a.m.

1145
02:13:46,896 --> 02:13:47,416
in the morning,

1146
02:13:49,550 --> 02:14:03,458
That's an early hour, and I can appreciate the fact that you have sealed loading docks, and you're taking steps to minimize the noise impact of the Mystic condo residents.

1147
02:14:03,998 --> 02:14:13,524
However, in my opinion, in order for this to be acceptable to Wegmans, who we welcome you to the community, I look forward to shopping in Wegmans.

1148
02:14:13,984 --> 02:14:15,485
I currently have to go out to Burlington now,

1149
02:14:16,165 --> 02:14:17,046
to shop at Wegmans.

1150
02:14:17,646 --> 02:14:18,966
And we welcome you here.

1151
02:14:19,226 --> 02:14:25,249
The residents that I've spoken with in the condos also are eager to shop in your facility.

1152
02:14:26,069 --> 02:14:28,550
But the concern is the deliveries.

1153
02:14:28,810 --> 02:14:44,457
And I would ask that the deliveries be limited not to just your hours of operation, but to hours that are acceptable to, even though you're in a commercial zoned area, to residential abutters.

1154
02:14:45,498 --> 02:14:50,032
And that would be my first point, if you're willing to make a concession.

1155
02:14:50,737 --> 02:14:52,178
on those particular hours.

1156
02:14:53,258 --> 02:14:58,821
And knowing that, you know, that's the heart of a business, deliveries, and I understand that.

1157
02:14:59,601 --> 02:15:00,622
So that would be my first.

1158
02:15:01,102 --> 02:15:14,529
The second point residents have noticed that I spoke with was having nothing to do with delivery trucks, but the exhaust unit on top of your building, which is the size of a small bus.

1159
02:15:15,788 --> 02:15:19,213
And recently that exhaust unit has been functioning.

1160
02:15:19,233 --> 02:15:26,884
I don't know if they're testing it or what's going on, but it emits a rather loud and frequent noise.

1161
02:15:27,885 --> 02:15:32,551
And I was wondering if there's any consideration to put additional buffers.

1162
02:15:33,392 --> 02:15:53,096
I know with other business establishments, we just had something on Riverside Ave, Smashburger, and a few other establishments that had something similar, not to the size that you have for exhaust, and they were able to put noise buffers to mitigate some of the noise for area residents that were roughly in the same proximity.

1163
02:15:53,116 --> 02:15:55,177
I was wondering if you could speak on that also.

1164
02:15:55,277 --> 02:16:01,438
So it would be limiting the delivery hours, not to just your hours of operation, but to extend it further.

1165
02:16:01,998 --> 02:16:04,639
and also the exhaust on top of the building.

1166
02:16:04,879 --> 02:16:05,079
Right.

1167
02:16:05,399 --> 02:16:06,599
Let me work backwards on that.

1168
02:16:06,639 --> 02:16:10,240
Certainly, as far as the rooftop units, we use state-of-the-art units.

1169
02:16:11,120 --> 02:16:28,643
We offer to this council, and certainly to the building department and any professionals they have on staff, we can certainly review with the town engineer, here again, through you, with you, the specific specifications of those units, and if there's the possibility to look at possible mitigation measures on that.

1170
02:16:29,555 --> 02:16:38,782
As far as the deliveries, we are not speaking a large number of tractor trailers from 11 to midnight, or between 11 and midnight and 6 a.m.

1171
02:16:38,802 --> 02:16:39,463
in the morning.

1172
02:16:39,723 --> 02:16:48,250
We're talking one, two at the extreme, and the standard time of year, and that's once seven days a week.

1173
02:16:48,910 --> 02:16:55,075
So we're talking one tractor trailer, the anomaly of two at that one hour at the extreme and one hour in the morning.

1174
02:16:55,515 --> 02:16:58,419
And here again, we will be in compliance.

1175
02:16:58,440 --> 02:16:59,321
We're committed to it.

1176
02:16:59,461 --> 02:17:05,750
We are in all communities being in compliance with town codes, city codes, or noise ordinances in this particular case.

1177
02:17:06,471 --> 02:17:08,935
And we have, the city council has, that

1178
02:17:10,828 --> 02:17:16,113
if you will, that safeguard to come to us and saying you're in violation.

1179
02:17:16,173 --> 02:17:22,199
But quite frankly, before that happens, we'll be the first to hear in our store operations, our store managers.

1180
02:17:22,979 --> 02:17:26,422
This is not the first store we're adjacent to a residential unit.

1181
02:17:27,023 --> 02:17:29,265
We have at least a dozen of them in our chains.

1182
02:17:29,505 --> 02:17:32,828
And we have worked through many issues, if there were issues to begin with.

1183
02:17:33,849 --> 02:17:50,754
And that's where we would offer, here again, self-restricted overnight deliveries, but keep up to midnight, with the understanding that it would be one, two, at the extreme as far as the anomaly, and that is in that particular hour, at the end and at the beginning.

1184
02:17:51,115 --> 02:17:52,295
And here again, it comes to,

1185
02:17:54,063 --> 02:18:00,909
It does come down to the basics of the weather and transportation and the overload of the highways.

1186
02:18:00,949 --> 02:18:03,331
These tractor trailers are coming from Rochester, New York.

1187
02:18:03,371 --> 02:18:04,692
It's six plus hours.

1188
02:18:05,392 --> 02:18:10,016
So we have the folks that are familiar or in the business themselves.

1189
02:18:10,036 --> 02:18:11,537
I'm not telling them anything new.

1190
02:18:11,898 --> 02:18:18,563
The logistics on getting stuff from a warehouse into a truck, 300 miles away,

1191
02:18:24,217 --> 02:18:25,338
There's six hours away.

1192
02:18:25,358 --> 02:18:29,580
It's very difficult, and it's a challenging month of flexibility.

1193
02:18:29,600 --> 02:18:38,345
That will allow us as a free board, and where we can, we will try to keep it to 11 and not 5 to 12 or 11.45.

1194
02:18:38,925 --> 02:18:51,972
Our intent is not to push it to the limits, but give a little latitude to remain a flexible, productive, successful business for the benefit, obviously, our business and then the community.

1195
02:18:53,802 --> 02:19:02,193
So from what I'm hearing from you, and I appreciate the flexibility, but not at the expense of the residents that live within 200 feet.

1196
02:19:03,094 --> 02:19:10,044
And I appreciate the fact that these trucks are going to be coming from Rochester, New York, the fact that there's New England weather involved.

1197
02:19:10,564 --> 02:19:31,742
and so forth, and that makes me even feel more comfortable with my decision not to go right to midnight, because I think what we're going to end up seeing, and I've been doing this for a number of years, is that we're going to see the later deliveries, and we're going to see the 11, 30, 12 o'clock, a truck shows up at midnight,

1198
02:19:32,442 --> 02:19:39,346
or 10 past midnight with $300,000 worth of filet mignon, I'm sure you're going to unload it.

1199
02:19:39,787 --> 02:19:45,190
I can commit to Mr. Councilman and to this council and to the community, we would self-restrict on that.

1200
02:19:45,630 --> 02:19:52,434
We start hearing those concerns, our tractor trailer drivers, if that starts happening, we will be the first to rein that in.

1201
02:19:53,635 --> 02:19:58,101
And adjusted accordingly, but that's where we're asking for that flexibility under the recognition.

1202
02:19:58,642 --> 02:19:59,563
We are a partner.

1203
02:20:00,064 --> 02:20:02,027
We are a community neighbor.

1204
02:20:02,848 --> 02:20:03,529
We ask for that.

1205
02:20:06,214 --> 02:20:18,844
assistance, if you will, and allow that flexibility here again, recognizing we understand code, we understand noise ordinance, we understand and respect the neighbors, and we will not be doing the 12 o'clock, 1145.

1206
02:20:19,765 --> 02:20:21,086
It will not be creeped.

1207
02:20:21,146 --> 02:20:23,288
If that happens, we'll be the first to cut back on it.

1208
02:20:24,257 --> 02:20:35,709
And you realize this is a special permit, so even the fact that you understand code and noise ordinances, you're asking to work outside of the operating parameters of the current noise ordinances.

1209
02:20:35,749 --> 02:20:37,451
What I'm saying is an overlay on that.

1210
02:20:37,491 --> 02:20:39,433
I'm respectful of what we're saying is.

1211
02:20:40,093 --> 02:20:44,375
I certainly understand that, yes, and I'm not trying to end around the special permit.

1212
02:20:44,755 --> 02:20:53,900
I'm recognizing that we understand the rules and regulations just as throughout the construction that we have to abide by, you know, building codes, et cetera.

1213
02:20:54,340 --> 02:20:56,301
The same thing once we're up and operating.

1214
02:20:56,341 --> 02:21:00,863
We understand and respect, quite frankly, and understand and we will comply.

1215
02:21:01,483 --> 02:21:10,766
if not self-restricted, if there's little missteps, we are the first to react to the positive in reaction to the community, more specifically the town and the council.

1216
02:21:11,766 --> 02:21:12,627
You have our commitment.

1217
02:21:14,047 --> 02:21:27,111
Mr. President, just if I could, and I know some residents are probably going to want to speak from the Mr. Condos, my support for any special permit tonight, and I just want the gentleman who I respect and

1218
02:21:28,087 --> 02:21:44,459
thank the business for coming into our community, that my stance is going to remain the same, that the hours of operation for delivery should at the very least coincide with current ordinances and not the extended permit which you're requesting.

1219
02:21:45,220 --> 02:21:52,605
And if that is something that you can work with and compromise, then as a member of the council, you'll have my vote tonight.

1220
02:21:53,006 --> 02:21:54,607
Otherwise, I think

1221
02:21:55,648 --> 02:21:57,830
At least from my standpoint, I can't support it.

1222
02:21:58,971 --> 02:21:59,471
Thank you.

1223
02:21:59,992 --> 02:22:02,534
Mr. Pierce, you have a store in Chestnut Hill.

1224
02:22:03,014 --> 02:22:03,895
We do.

1225
02:22:04,115 --> 02:22:08,858
That has apartments that are closer than what are here in Midwood.

1226
02:22:08,918 --> 02:22:12,821
How have you dealt with that situation?

1227
02:22:12,961 --> 02:22:15,944
Here again, we're committed as we are in this community to that community.

1228
02:22:16,004 --> 02:22:18,225
And it's restricted from midnight to 6 AM.

1229
02:22:19,206 --> 02:22:21,168
And you've had no problems in Chestnut Hill?

1230
02:22:22,189 --> 02:22:23,269
That's my understanding, correct.

1231
02:22:26,641 --> 02:22:28,401
If I can, thank you, Mr President.

1232
02:22:28,922 --> 02:22:46,628
I know in the past this council has looked at different concerns and issues like this and not holding Wegmans back, but could we do a 90 day trial period and move from there to see if that

1233
02:22:47,400 --> 02:23:01,330
In that 90 days, if those 200 abutters feel that we report back to those neighbors, and if it's something that it has been a distraction, that we re-evaluate.

1234
02:23:01,350 --> 02:23:05,312
Thank you.

1235
02:23:06,153 --> 02:23:07,054
Councilor Layton.

1236
02:23:07,094 --> 02:23:08,454
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1237
02:23:09,855 --> 02:23:14,779
This is a situation that is very similar to the situation we faced at the last meeting.

1238
02:23:15,262 --> 02:23:22,887
where we had a business that was seeking a special permit that directly abutted a residential property that was multi-family use.

1239
02:23:24,288 --> 02:23:27,050
Now, we have Wegmans, and Wegmans has been a great partner of the community.

1240
02:23:27,110 --> 02:23:28,271
I'm not going to say they haven't been.

1241
02:23:28,371 --> 02:23:36,537
Wegmans has done a great job in redeveloping that parcel and giving it a new, fresh look from that old, tired, and drawn-out look that was the Meadowbrook Mall.

1242
02:23:37,532 --> 02:23:45,535
But we also have an opportunity this evening to protect the quality of life of 132 residents whose homes face this building and face this street, Mr. President.

1243
02:23:47,136 --> 02:23:50,917
I, for one, am a little concerned about an application for a special permit.

1244
02:23:52,258 --> 02:23:57,860
And Wegmans coming here and asking us to offer it when they really haven't been in operation for too long, as it is right now.

1245
02:24:00,241 --> 02:24:12,287
And the 132 residents that units face this property haven't really gotten the full picture of what it's going to be like when Wegmans is in operation, whether or not the hours of operation is 7 in the morning until 11 at night or 6 in the morning until midnight.

1246
02:24:13,808 --> 02:24:18,350
One of the concerns that I might have is we say, OK, here's your special permit.

1247
02:24:18,590 --> 02:24:20,211
You guys can go until 12 o'clock at night.

1248
02:24:20,251 --> 02:24:21,612
And you can go until 12 o'clock at night.

1249
02:24:22,372 --> 02:24:25,055
Something I'm not too crazy about at this point in time, Mr. President.

1250
02:24:26,096 --> 02:24:31,461
And what happens is the residents come back and say Wegmans has been in operation now for 180 days.

1251
02:24:31,701 --> 02:24:37,666
And over the last 180 days, at 9.30 at night, 55 trucks pull up, and they make more noise than we could ever deal with.

1252
02:24:38,027 --> 02:24:43,692
We have the opportunity, because this is a special permit, to put certain restrictions and certain parameters on the special permit.

1253
02:24:44,142 --> 02:24:51,865
Some of those restrictions that we could put in would be that signs are posted visibly at the access points that say no loading after certain hours or during certain hours.

1254
02:24:51,885 --> 02:24:56,087
And those hours could be whatever this council sees fit, whatever this council deems appropriate, Mr. President.

1255
02:24:56,827 --> 02:24:59,408
Whereas this is a special permit, and I believe it's

1256
02:25:00,108 --> 02:25:06,510
Governed under Chapter 48 of the General Laws, Section 9, we have 90 days to act on the request once it's perfected and comes to our body.

1257
02:25:06,770 --> 02:25:15,133
And I think it might make sense for us to table this matter and wait 90 days and see what happens with Wegmans when they're in operation so that the residents have a better idea of what it is that they're dealing with, Mr. President.

1258
02:25:16,194 --> 02:25:20,299
Ultimately, we're in a situation right now where we have a new, fresh business in the community, and they're a great partner.

1259
02:25:20,319 --> 02:25:21,220
They are a great partner.

1260
02:25:21,621 --> 02:25:30,612
But I think that the first job that we have in the City Council, number one, is to keep our streets safe, and number two is to protect the integrity and the quality of life of the taxpaying residents that reside here, Mr. President.

1261
02:25:30,952 --> 02:25:37,836
And I think it's very important for us to recognize the fact that the condo market in the city of Medford is, through the roof, skyrocketing hot right now.

1262
02:25:38,517 --> 02:25:43,640
The residents in these condominiums pay a ton of money in taxes, as does Wegmans, Mr. President, as does Wegmans.

1263
02:25:43,680 --> 02:25:45,481
But I think that the residents have to come first.

1264
02:25:46,102 --> 02:25:49,224
And I think that this is something that needs a longer and hotter look, Mr. President.

1265
02:25:49,264 --> 02:25:51,505
We need to determine what the impact is going to be.

1266
02:25:51,645 --> 02:25:54,827
And maybe we should look at that impact in the first 90 days of their operation.

1267
02:25:55,047 --> 02:25:58,770
Right now, we have a permit that's in front of us that's saying, will you let us be open longer?

1268
02:25:59,330 --> 02:26:01,031
Why don't we say, well, think about it.

1269
02:26:01,171 --> 02:26:05,873
Let's see what happens over the next 90 days, as opposed to putting contingencies and parameters on it.

1270
02:26:06,173 --> 02:26:08,294
Why don't we see what happens over the next 90 days?

1271
02:26:08,334 --> 02:26:20,820
Let these residents get a taste of what's going on over there, so when they come back to us with their concerns, they have a little bit more of an informed opinion and a little bit more of an understanding of what it's really like, so that they can tell us what it's really like, because none of us live there.

1272
02:26:20,940 --> 02:26:23,502
They live there every day, and they're the ones that are going to have to deal with this.

1273
02:26:24,162 --> 02:26:31,308
So, well, you know, the partnership in the community is excellent, and we certainly appreciate the fundings that they've donated for the Clippership Connector and so on and so forth.

1274
02:26:31,648 --> 02:26:34,530
It's the people that live in this community that make this community great, Mr. President.

1275
02:26:34,570 --> 02:26:35,871
We need to protect them.

1276
02:26:35,912 --> 02:26:46,380
So my recommended course of action would be tabling this matter for 90 days, as outlined by the general laws, which is well within our scope and authority, and seeing what happens over the next 90 days.

1277
02:26:46,560 --> 02:26:49,884
two or three months during the regular hours of operation of 7 a.m.

1278
02:26:49,904 --> 02:26:50,705
to 11 p.m.

1279
02:26:51,085 --> 02:26:57,333
so that we can determine whether or not there are additional parameters that need to be put on the special permit outside of the 11 o'clock hour.

1280
02:26:57,653 --> 02:26:59,075
Never mind granting it until 12.

1281
02:26:59,135 --> 02:27:02,539
Maybe they come for a special permit and say we want our hours of operation to be x, y, and z.

1282
02:27:03,059 --> 02:27:13,145
But all the residents are very upset that the deliveries that happen at a certain time, during jeopardy, I don't know, for whatever reason, whatever problems that the residents have with deliveries happening, whether the volume is high, so on and so forth.

1283
02:27:13,185 --> 02:27:15,427
We have an opportunity to protect these residents, Mr. President.

1284
02:27:15,467 --> 02:27:21,390
And I think that the proper course of action this evening would be to table the matter.

1285
02:27:21,930 --> 02:27:23,311
Thank you, President Carviello.

1286
02:27:23,391 --> 02:27:27,794
I'd just be interested in hearing from the residents, if anybody would like to add.

1287
02:27:28,480 --> 02:27:29,821
And they have made concessions.

1288
02:27:30,021 --> 02:27:31,402
Wigmans has made concessions.

1289
02:27:31,723 --> 02:27:36,226
There's been suggestions on the floor, but I think it's important to hear from those that live there.

1290
02:27:36,887 --> 02:27:41,170
Any residents would like to speak on this matter, please step forward.

1291
02:27:43,492 --> 02:27:44,753
Name and address of the record, please.

1292
02:27:44,773 --> 02:27:45,614
Hi, Bill Barabino.

1293
02:27:45,734 --> 02:27:48,916
I live at Mystic Valley Parkway, 390 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1294
02:27:50,457 --> 02:27:52,579
And I can say, I joined the, uh,

1295
02:27:54,212 --> 02:27:56,514
commerce there in supporting this.

1296
02:27:56,614 --> 02:27:59,657
I think this is gonna be, Wegmans is a beautiful building.

1297
02:27:59,997 --> 02:28:01,579
It's amazing on the outside.

1298
02:28:01,759 --> 02:28:08,385
I myself and my wife went to the Burlington store just to check it out because we got the Wegmans fever.

1299
02:28:09,026 --> 02:28:16,513
And I met the owner, not the owner, but the store manager, Kevin, he was here a minute ago.

1300
02:28:17,754 --> 02:28:19,936
Very kind, very, very nice people.

1301
02:28:20,587 --> 02:28:35,400
So, however, I think Wegmans, as it stands right now, as it's set up, it's gonna be damaging, and it's gonna be simply destructive to 39020 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1302
02:28:36,100 --> 02:28:39,243
In particular, I think what you find is the west-facing side.

1303
02:28:39,964 --> 02:28:46,029
And the reason why is basically, and I have a packet in front of you, I don't know if you've gotten to it,

1304
02:28:46,549 --> 02:28:52,892
Essentially what you have is a 390-20 Mystic Valley Parkway is a very large 11-story, 265 units.

1305
02:28:52,932 --> 02:28:54,073
I know you're familiar with it.

1306
02:28:54,373 --> 02:28:55,654
But it's large and it's brick.

1307
02:28:56,514 --> 02:29:01,297
And then you have Wegmans and the whole Mystic Valley Parkway Mall.

1308
02:29:01,577 --> 02:29:05,579
And what that is is also a very large brick building.

1309
02:29:06,299 --> 02:29:08,600
Or it's cement or whatever.

1310
02:29:09,220 --> 02:29:12,701
What you have, it develops as an echo chamber, right?

1311
02:29:12,982 --> 02:29:14,502
It's an echo chamber in there.

1312
02:29:14,602 --> 02:29:21,105
And in fact, they've even made another road, which has sort of taken out some vegetation as well.

1313
02:29:21,125 --> 02:29:24,126
So it's probably even slightly even louder than it was.

1314
02:29:24,906 --> 02:29:26,687
But what you have is now an echo chamber.

1315
02:29:27,207 --> 02:29:32,708
And the shipping lanes are in that echo chamber.

1316
02:29:33,068 --> 02:29:38,630
So everything you hear about the trucks is spot on, spot on, everybody who has mentioned that.

1317
02:29:38,970 --> 02:29:40,650
Yes, it's a big problem.

1318
02:29:40,670 --> 02:29:48,933
So the shipping lanes, the reason why this place is defective is because the shipping lanes go right through the back, right in between that echo chamber.

1319
02:29:50,893 --> 02:29:54,236
For example, when something travels in between, it's loud.

1320
02:29:54,296 --> 02:29:55,397
For example, trucks.

1321
02:29:55,517 --> 02:29:57,099
Trucks have to go through there, they go through there.

1322
02:29:57,479 --> 02:29:59,221
Trucks are loud for all the reasons.

1323
02:29:59,281 --> 02:30:04,546
The gate drops, the doors shut, and the engines, the brakes go.

1324
02:30:07,168 --> 02:30:09,050
But the biggest thing,

1325
02:30:09,745 --> 02:30:13,827
The biggest thing is when the reverse lights go on.

1326
02:30:13,907 --> 02:30:22,830
So as you're probably well aware, and it's probably come up before, the reverse alarms, when a truck, any truck reverses, the alarms go off.

1327
02:30:22,870 --> 02:30:23,510
It's federal law.

1328
02:30:23,550 --> 02:30:24,911
They have to have those alarms.

1329
02:30:24,951 --> 02:30:26,171
They make a loud noise.

1330
02:30:29,254 --> 02:30:34,340
Those alarms that you hear, first of all, at night, it's dead quiet there.

1331
02:30:34,640 --> 02:30:37,063
At night, you don't even hear the traffic unless you're up front.

1332
02:30:37,824 --> 02:30:40,927
But in that echo chamber, you hear those alarms.

1333
02:30:41,487 --> 02:30:48,094
And those alarms, those reverse alarms, most pungent, those are at about between 97 and 112 decibels.

1334
02:30:51,112 --> 02:30:52,133
That's how loud they are.

1335
02:30:52,193 --> 02:30:55,476
That's basically the study show.

1336
02:30:55,756 --> 02:30:56,356
97 between 112.

1337
02:30:56,416 --> 02:31:09,407
Now, to give you an example of decibels, a turboprop airplane taking off at 200 feet away is 118 decibels on takeoff.

1338
02:31:09,927 --> 02:31:12,389
So it's that explosive, that noise.

1339
02:31:12,930 --> 02:31:15,132
And I don't think that's taking into consideration the echo.

1340
02:31:15,952 --> 02:31:19,955
Now, what happens when those alarms go off?

1341
02:31:20,035 --> 02:31:20,556
I wake up.

1342
02:31:21,056 --> 02:31:25,260
And so when I wake up, I can't sleep, or I at least get up for a period of time.

1343
02:31:25,680 --> 02:31:33,226
And then when I get up, if I can't sleep there, then the whole purpose of my home is no longer there.

1344
02:31:33,607 --> 02:31:38,471
And what I have is now, I own a piece of brick, and I own some sheetrock in Medford.

1345
02:31:38,691 --> 02:31:40,573
I don't own a home, because I can't live there.

1346
02:31:41,447 --> 02:31:48,073
Fortunately, for me, and I think for some of the people here, is I know that the city council,

1347
02:31:51,063 --> 02:31:52,744
can protect my family.

1348
02:31:53,184 --> 02:31:56,086
And I know I can possibly have a partner here.

1349
02:31:56,606 --> 02:32:00,328
And that is because in 2014, I came before the council.

1350
02:32:00,588 --> 02:32:02,009
I just happened to be here.

1351
02:32:02,089 --> 02:32:03,610
It was exactly the same issue.

1352
02:32:03,730 --> 02:32:06,012
It was a special permit in Kohl's.

1353
02:32:06,592 --> 02:32:15,737
Kohl's, because of the special permit, and you could put conditions on it, I simply came up and said, you know, there's a couple trucks and the reverse alarms.

1354
02:32:15,757 --> 02:32:20,120
And because I think Kohl's at the time, they wanted just to operate 24 hours a day.

1355
02:32:21,065 --> 02:32:27,046
And that's essentially what Wegmans is to us, because I think the most part, if it's during any time you're sleeping, forget it.

1356
02:32:27,286 --> 02:32:32,847
But what they want in 2014 is just to operate six days, 24 hours.

1357
02:32:33,728 --> 02:32:36,228
And right here, right at the podium, I was so impressed.

1358
02:32:36,248 --> 02:32:37,608
I hadn't been in one of these before.

1359
02:32:38,769 --> 02:32:40,409
We solved it right there with the attorney.

1360
02:32:40,469 --> 02:32:47,630
And you guys, ladies and gentlemen, both came in and said, we sat there, went back and forth, and eventually you put a prohibition.

1361
02:32:47,670 --> 02:32:49,071
You said, listen, 11 to seven,

1362
02:32:50,708 --> 02:33:05,381
You're not driving trucks, and you also put some, I think, some police presence and different things, which hadn't even come to my mind, but in the knowledge and wisdom of the board, you addressed it, you protected the community, you protected me.

1363
02:33:07,023 --> 02:33:14,029
Now, fortunately, as Councilor Knight had mentioned, people don't know what's coming.

1364
02:33:14,479 --> 02:33:31,786
There's been construction, the construction has been pretty good, and I've gone out and talked to them, and there's been some missteps, well at least I can tell you, I don't know if they're missteps, but I can tell you at least three events in the last two months that document in my affidavit, and also give you some supporting evidence.

1365
02:33:32,026 --> 02:33:33,006
But I can tell you that,

1366
02:33:36,515 --> 02:33:37,635
We don't really know what's coming.

1367
02:33:37,936 --> 02:33:38,836
The building's up.

1368
02:33:38,916 --> 02:33:39,356
It's nice.

1369
02:33:39,596 --> 02:33:41,297
We haven't seen a truck, really.

1370
02:33:41,357 --> 02:33:43,878
I mean, you've got some pick up and some that sort of thing.

1371
02:33:44,098 --> 02:33:44,718
We're not ready.

1372
02:33:44,818 --> 02:33:50,741
So I know you've saved certainly my family.

1373
02:33:51,721 --> 02:33:53,222
And I think it's going to be a lot in 2014.

1374
02:33:53,302 --> 02:33:55,763
I think it's going to be a lot different now.

1375
02:33:58,144 --> 02:33:59,184
I'm asking for three things.

1376
02:34:00,064 --> 02:34:02,225
So I'm asking for three things, and I think that,

1377
02:34:04,618 --> 02:34:10,923
we can coexist with Wegmans, and I think embrace them and have a great welcoming to Medford.

1378
02:34:11,223 --> 02:34:14,125
And those three things are, which have somewhat been mentioned.

1379
02:34:14,906 --> 02:34:19,009
One is that you limit the operation of the vehicles.

1380
02:34:19,629 --> 02:34:24,453
So that's really, I think, is going to be the operation of the back of Wegmans, the vehicles.

1381
02:34:24,793 --> 02:34:28,075
So that's number one, the operation of the back of the vehicles.

1382
02:34:29,116 --> 02:34:33,402
When those alarms go off, I think it's fair, we want, I think you need to get eight hours of sleep.

1383
02:34:33,762 --> 02:34:39,209
If we know that they're gonna, you've acknowledged to me before that they can be bothersome, we're gonna restrict them.

1384
02:34:39,549 --> 02:34:41,312
So we should give at least eight hours.

1385
02:34:42,871 --> 02:34:48,193
So I'm suggesting, I've talked to the attorney, the morning hours are more important to them.

1386
02:34:48,713 --> 02:35:00,657
Personally, I get up at 6.30, I don't wanna speak for everyone else, but my sense is, start at 7 or even 6, but let's just get to bed, because you gotta go to sleep to get to work.

1387
02:35:01,077 --> 02:35:10,520
And I know for me, I go to bed at 9.30, and as counsel has mentioned, I'm not sure exactly who, but when we were talking about it before,

1388
02:35:12,330 --> 02:35:18,793
I would be, when they start operating, I would be sitting, waiting, because I go to bed about 9, 30, 10.

1389
02:35:19,153 --> 02:35:23,775
I would be sitting, waiting for them to stop operations to go to sleep.

1390
02:35:24,155 --> 02:35:25,216
That's what I would be doing.

1391
02:35:25,576 --> 02:35:27,136
So to think one's rolling in.

1392
02:35:27,637 --> 02:35:30,138
Now, so I said one, the hours of operation.

1393
02:35:30,238 --> 02:35:35,660
Two, the other thing is they also have 24 hour, they also have 24 hour trash pickup.

1394
02:35:38,141 --> 02:35:40,582
Now, that's an accelerated noise.

1395
02:35:40,682 --> 02:35:42,742
It's actually as you get the reverse lights.

1396
02:35:42,762 --> 02:35:44,503
24 hours, it's minus 10.

1397
02:35:44,643 --> 02:35:46,723
I've talked to the building department.

1398
02:35:46,743 --> 02:35:48,624
The building department, they're allowed to do that.

1399
02:35:49,004 --> 02:35:51,084
That 24, that is a disaster.

1400
02:35:51,104 --> 02:35:52,505
438, I've been out there.

1401
02:35:52,545 --> 02:35:53,105
I talked to them.

1402
02:35:53,405 --> 02:35:55,326
Apparently, they're allowed to do that.

1403
02:35:55,586 --> 02:35:57,586
And it just scrapes the metal right off.

1404
02:35:57,606 --> 02:36:00,667
I mean, there's nothing else to do but go over there because I'm awake.

1405
02:36:02,113 --> 02:36:08,536
Now, I've talked to Kevin, and this is an important point, and I think he's mentioned it too.

1406
02:36:08,936 --> 02:36:11,938
The question is, we want to partner with web, because we don't want to interfere with them.

1407
02:36:12,378 --> 02:36:18,100
I can tell, and I know, Mr. President, you were very supportive and you've been very communicative.

1408
02:36:18,220 --> 02:36:24,343
You've answered as best as you can all my concerns, and everybody has, and I acknowledge that.

1409
02:36:24,363 --> 02:36:28,325
I have not been ignored by anybody, and I thank you for that.

1410
02:36:29,626 --> 02:36:41,898
The last thing I have is oversight because whatever restriction you have that restriction has to be like that is it and you don't get in and I feel bad for some person driving from Maine.

1411
02:36:43,847 --> 02:36:46,690
We need to know that that's it, that's bedtime.

1412
02:36:46,930 --> 02:36:48,232
That's the rules, that's bedtime.

1413
02:36:48,512 --> 02:36:57,823
My suggestion, six, seven, whatever it is they start, but let us get to bed, and you have to give us eight hours of sleep.

1414
02:36:58,203 --> 02:37:01,347
Now, the only thing I mentioned, and I'm gonna close is,

1415
02:37:01,747 --> 02:37:09,670
I've spoke to, in terms of controlling deliveries, I took time off of my schedule, and I went to the alcohol meeting.

1416
02:37:09,831 --> 02:37:12,372
And now the question was, they wanted special permits.

1417
02:37:12,412 --> 02:37:17,754
Now, I listened to the questions, and it was very probing questions of all the councils.

1418
02:37:18,114 --> 02:37:19,275
They're going to have end caps.

1419
02:37:19,315 --> 02:37:21,536
They're going to sell alcohol at the end.

1420
02:37:21,556 --> 02:37:23,556
They're going to have, I think, something like 10,000 square feet.

1421
02:37:26,453 --> 02:37:29,497
That is a separate commission that doesn't fall under our purview.

1422
02:37:30,017 --> 02:37:32,140
And I'm going to close right now.

1423
02:37:32,620 --> 02:37:39,869
I would just say that at that meeting, you were very generous with your time there and you were now.

1424
02:37:40,590 --> 02:37:42,051
But I would just close with

1425
02:37:43,766 --> 02:37:51,031
I met with, I didn't object, and I conditioned my objection solely on deliveries.

1426
02:37:51,571 --> 02:37:58,736
And when Kevin gave me his card, which is in your packet, he told me, we control deliveries.

1427
02:37:58,936 --> 02:37:59,877
It's not an issue.

1428
02:38:00,157 --> 02:38:02,218
I spoke to the attorney, I spoke to Kevin.

1429
02:38:02,478 --> 02:38:03,399
It made me feel good.

1430
02:38:03,899 --> 02:38:10,124
And it also, additionally, it also is reinforced by the fact that

1431
02:38:11,209 --> 02:38:12,530
They come all the way from Maine.

1432
02:38:12,990 --> 02:38:19,994
So I think it's really scheduled, but really I just want to, um, you know, be able to go to sleep on time.

1433
02:38:20,394 --> 02:38:20,714
Thank you.

1434
02:38:20,854 --> 02:38:21,274
Thank you.

1435
02:38:22,975 --> 02:38:23,455
Anyone else?

1436
02:38:23,475 --> 02:38:23,856
Let's speak.

1437
02:38:25,476 --> 02:38:27,798
Name and address of the record, please.

1438
02:38:27,818 --> 02:38:29,679
John Costas, 25 Salem street.

1439
02:38:29,979 --> 02:38:37,463
Um, past president of the chamber of commerce, current board member of the chamber of commerce, but I'm not speaking here for the chamber of commerce.

1440
02:38:37,903 --> 02:38:38,003
Um,

1441
02:38:39,326 --> 02:38:41,328
Wegmans is a huge operation.

1442
02:38:43,149 --> 02:38:46,211
We all enjoy large operations in the city.

1443
02:38:47,793 --> 02:38:58,161
The property tax they're paying, and what they're going to do financially for the city at twice the residential, I mean, what is the answer?

1444
02:38:58,601 --> 02:39:03,085
In other words, why did we allow Wegmans to build all the Meadow Glen Mall?

1445
02:39:03,365 --> 02:39:06,988
When Meadow Glen Mall went out of business, we should have said, tear it down.

1446
02:39:08,125 --> 02:39:16,388
There's residential condos, no matter what we do, unless we put a tiny modern pub store there, you shouldn't have Wegmans there.

1447
02:39:16,968 --> 02:39:20,690
However, we had Meadow Glen Mall for 35 years there.

1448
02:39:22,750 --> 02:39:31,894
I understand there's noises, but for the people that are gonna complain about the noises at 1130 at night, you're gonna have people that work nights.

1449
02:39:32,694 --> 02:39:35,735
They're gonna complain, I don't want you unloading your trucks,

1450
02:39:36,612 --> 02:39:37,513
11 o'clock in the morning.

1451
02:39:38,034 --> 02:39:38,995
I gotta sleep.

1452
02:39:39,415 --> 02:39:41,737
I work nights again.

1453
02:39:42,238 --> 02:39:43,139
What are you gonna do?

1454
02:39:43,739 --> 02:39:45,181
It's a big operation.

1455
02:39:45,601 --> 02:39:48,424
They can't be accommodating every single little rule.

1456
02:39:49,104 --> 02:39:52,768
And if the city and the residents have issues with these corporations,

1457
02:39:53,452 --> 02:39:58,696
then do not allow any large corporations to open up in this city anymore.

1458
02:39:59,376 --> 02:40:06,461
If you're not a tiny operation, you're not going to sell alcohol, you're not going to have tractor-trailers, you're welcome in Medford.

1459
02:40:07,281 --> 02:40:11,805
But if you're a big company that's going to generate a thousand jobs, get lost.

1460
02:40:12,645 --> 02:40:18,409
We don't want you here because you're too close to residential condos or apartments or whatever.

1461
02:40:18,930 --> 02:40:20,811
Case in point, the doggy daycare thing.

1462
02:40:21,552 --> 02:40:26,536
So what is the answer when you get residential next to commercial industrial property?

1463
02:40:26,556 --> 02:40:32,300
I mean, we can't keep coming and complaining and saying, listen, I don't want this business here.

1464
02:40:32,821 --> 02:40:33,481
I can't sleep.

1465
02:40:33,501 --> 02:40:34,802
I don't want this business here.

1466
02:40:35,723 --> 02:40:40,807
Again, we should not have let them open if everybody's going to complain about their operation.

1467
02:40:41,963 --> 02:40:45,124
I mean, they have good neighbors.

1468
02:40:45,184 --> 02:40:48,846
They're going to generate all this revenue for us, all this job opportunities.

1469
02:40:50,467 --> 02:40:52,187
What else is the answer to them?

1470
02:40:52,427 --> 02:41:00,671
I mean, let's not make business difficult for business to survive in this community and put a whole lot of restrictions on them.

1471
02:41:00,791 --> 02:41:03,372
Try to find an answer, but they're good people.

1472
02:41:03,912 --> 02:41:08,594
And I think they have a lot to offer this community in addition to twice the property

1473
02:41:17,877 --> 02:41:19,517
Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

1474
02:41:19,637 --> 02:41:22,138
Hi, Tina Caruso, Medford Square.

1475
02:41:22,938 --> 02:41:26,819
I am the president of the chamber, and I'm representing the Chamber of Commerce.

1476
02:41:27,619 --> 02:41:34,401
And I just want to take a moment of your time just to give you our view on the support for Wegmans.

1477
02:41:35,321 --> 02:41:42,582
Since the announcement of Wegmans coming to Medford, they have generously donated to many local organizations and events.

1478
02:41:43,843 --> 02:41:45,203
And it's all throughout the city.

1479
02:41:46,078 --> 02:41:48,259
but also they're present.

1480
02:41:48,499 --> 02:41:50,779
They don't just write a check and walk away.

1481
02:41:50,799 --> 02:41:52,239
They show up.

1482
02:41:53,920 --> 02:42:04,422
By changing the work hours, they're meeting the needs of our community, the part of the community that has to be in work super early and those that work very late.

1483
02:42:05,823 --> 02:42:10,744
They're also hiring locally, part-time as well as full-time.

1484
02:42:11,664 --> 02:42:14,485
Think of the effect that that extra one hour

1485
02:42:15,913 --> 02:42:21,518
can have on one part-time employee, it's about $3,000 a year.

1486
02:42:21,638 --> 02:42:26,863
And I think of my daughter and I say, oh boy, she could really use that.

1487
02:42:28,304 --> 02:42:37,493
All these types of things, along with the other things that have already been said, are helping our local economy in Medven.

1488
02:42:38,738 --> 02:42:46,906
As a strong contributor to the economic climate in our city, it would be beneficial to support Wegmans in their request.

1489
02:42:47,366 --> 02:42:48,628
Thank you so much for your time.

1490
02:42:49,208 --> 02:42:49,589
Thank you.

1491
02:42:52,611 --> 02:42:53,712
Name and address of the record, please.

1492
02:42:54,608 --> 02:43:03,093
Donovan Kamara, Chamber of Commerce, Co-Chair of the Governmental Affairs Committee for the Chamber, and a very happy resident of the city of Medford.

1493
02:43:03,694 --> 02:43:17,122
Actually, before I make the comments about Whitewater, I'd like to say how happy I am to return to Medford High School after 33 glorious years of having taught the likes of George Capelli and Adam Knight at this wonderful high school.

1494
02:43:17,162 --> 02:43:18,242
So it's nice to be back.

1495
02:43:18,302 --> 02:43:18,963
I feel at home.

1496
02:43:20,757 --> 02:43:31,550
I would like to strongly echo everything that Madam President of the Chamber just said and John Costas, although I am extremely empathetic that the gentleman spoke just before them.

1497
02:43:31,570 --> 02:43:34,814
I think it's important to get a good night's sleep.

1498
02:43:34,834 --> 02:43:36,316
I think it's important for me.

1499
02:43:36,396 --> 02:43:37,297
I live on Lawrence Road.

1500
02:43:37,998 --> 02:43:47,663
And on any given morning from, let's say, September to June, I hear nothing but beep, beep, beep, because this high school has cursed me for the past 40 years that I've been living there.

1501
02:43:47,703 --> 02:43:47,903
Why?

1502
02:43:47,923 --> 02:43:49,283
Because they have to get to the high school.

1503
02:43:49,744 --> 02:43:53,385
And it's a hell of a noise out there in the morning for 10 months out of the year.

1504
02:43:53,705 --> 02:43:54,766
But I chose to live there.

1505
02:43:55,386 --> 02:43:56,127
I love where I live.

1506
02:43:56,567 --> 02:43:59,588
The woods are in the back, so it's quiet in the back, but lots of noise in the front.

1507
02:44:00,229 --> 02:44:02,229
So I accommodated myself to having lived there.

1508
02:44:02,249 --> 02:44:02,810
I made a choice.

1509
02:44:03,849 --> 02:44:07,494
I also made a choice not to buy a condo in that particular complex years ago.

1510
02:44:07,734 --> 02:44:09,877
I could have when Murata first built it, you know.

1511
02:44:10,598 --> 02:44:13,221
And it's one of the busiest parkways in the state.

1512
02:44:14,092 --> 02:44:16,414
So that's a choice that we make, or we don't make.

1513
02:44:17,194 --> 02:44:17,955
But I feel bad.

1514
02:44:17,995 --> 02:44:22,138
I feel bad for the gentleman who says he wants to go to sleep at 9.30 at night or get a good night's sleep.

1515
02:44:22,198 --> 02:44:22,578
I do not.

1516
02:44:23,018 --> 02:44:40,090
So I would be strongly in favor, I am, as a member of the chamber and everything else, for their extended hours, assuming, of course, that some arrangements can be made, accommodations between the council, the neighbors, who should be respected, of course, and, naturally, the wakeman's itself.

1517
02:44:40,431 --> 02:44:41,511
It's a great institution.

1518
02:44:41,992 --> 02:44:43,353
I can't wait to go shopping there.

1519
02:44:44,013 --> 02:44:46,436
I mean, we've got Bar Food Store in South Medford.

1520
02:44:46,476 --> 02:44:46,936
I love it.

1521
02:44:47,276 --> 02:44:49,799
We've got Whole Foods in the back, and now we have Wegmans.

1522
02:44:50,139 --> 02:44:51,581
How lucky can this town get?

1523
02:44:52,101 --> 02:45:02,412
It's a beautiful, beautiful combination, and I'm happy that they're here, and I hope that a resolution that is happy to the neighbors and Wegmans and the council and everybody that wants to show up there is reached.

1524
02:45:02,712 --> 02:45:05,154
So I am strongly in favor of the extended hours.

1525
02:45:05,274 --> 02:45:05,615
Thank you.

1526
02:45:09,226 --> 02:45:10,366
Name and address of the record, please.

1527
02:45:11,006 --> 02:45:13,787
Charlotte Scuderi, 283 High Street, Medford.

1528
02:45:14,667 --> 02:45:18,388
First of all, I want to say I'm happy to have Whitemans in our city.

1529
02:45:19,128 --> 02:45:22,749
They have an excellent reputation wherever they have come up.

1530
02:45:23,349 --> 02:45:26,650
And I think that extra hour isn't going to bother anybody.

1531
02:45:27,150 --> 02:45:28,250
I live on High Street.

1532
02:45:28,330 --> 02:45:33,271
My trash gets picked up at 6 o'clock in the morning, and there's a lot of noise with the trucks.

1533
02:45:33,631 --> 02:45:34,672
I chose to live there.

1534
02:45:37,208 --> 02:45:40,449
I don't believe they're going to be having trash removed all day, all night.

1535
02:45:40,489 --> 02:45:41,389
That's not happening.

1536
02:45:41,929 --> 02:45:43,629
As far as the liquor, that's not happening.

1537
02:45:43,870 --> 02:45:48,331
The trucks coming in, delivering, I know they'll find an answer.

1538
02:45:48,471 --> 02:45:53,492
I think we should move ahead, give them the opportunity to show us what they can do.

1539
02:45:53,972 --> 02:45:56,592
And if there's a problem, address it after, not now.

1540
02:45:57,473 --> 02:45:57,833
Thank you.

1541
02:45:58,233 --> 02:45:58,553
Thank you.

1542
02:46:03,385 --> 02:46:03,825
Good evening.

1543
02:46:04,226 --> 02:46:06,567
Name and address of the record, please.

1544
02:46:06,627 --> 02:46:08,368
Brice Cipriani, 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1545
02:46:08,388 --> 02:46:17,074
I'd like to start by saying thank you again for having us here this evening, and thanks to everyone that came out to speak on this issue.

1546
02:46:17,934 --> 02:46:24,438
A lot of the items that I had in my notes were already addressed, so without risking repeating a lot of things,

1547
02:46:26,770 --> 02:46:28,871
Comments will be briefer than what I originally thought.

1548
02:46:29,571 --> 02:46:35,994
But it's also important for me to say that I think we all agree that we're welcoming white men into the community.

1549
02:46:36,514 --> 02:46:40,796
I also, and my family, also frequents the Burlington location.

1550
02:46:42,117 --> 02:46:50,660
And to have a location right next door within walking distance, we're thrilled about that.

1551
02:46:50,680 --> 02:46:52,421
I personally,

1552
02:46:53,612 --> 02:47:05,517
I am not in favor of the extended hours, but I want to be very specific that this is pertaining to the delivery, not the hours of operation of the store or what's going on in the front of the store.

1553
02:47:07,185 --> 02:47:08,046
We're fine with that.

1554
02:47:08,706 --> 02:47:11,187
But, again, that's my personal opinion.

1555
02:47:11,547 --> 02:47:21,830
As a member of the Board of Trustees of the Condo Association, I have an obligation and a responsibility to the unit owners and address any concerns that they have.

1556
02:47:22,351 --> 02:47:23,491
So it's a balancing act.

1557
02:47:24,251 --> 02:47:29,093
We want to make sure that we're being good neighbors, welcoming Whiteman's into the community.

1558
02:47:30,013 --> 02:47:34,575
But we do have the concerns, again, specifically what's going on in the rear of the store.

1559
02:47:35,115 --> 02:47:40,939
As far as the hours of operation, store hours, that's fine.

1560
02:47:44,801 --> 02:47:50,885
In talking with some of the residents this evening, I think that we would be open.

1561
02:47:52,103 --> 02:47:56,728
to possibly considering a review and maybe readdressing the issue.

1562
02:47:58,169 --> 02:48:06,538
I will say one thing, that this morning, by coincidence, at 3.04 a.m., a truck pulled in to the back of Wegmans.

1563
02:48:07,714 --> 02:48:08,575
and made a delivery.

1564
02:48:09,815 --> 02:48:16,298
So I think that Wegmans should already be taking control of this, not once the store has this grand opening.

1565
02:48:16,318 --> 02:48:23,301
I think from the time that the shovel was put in the ground up until whenever they're gonna be in control of this.

1566
02:48:23,582 --> 02:48:25,482
And so 3 or 4 a.m.

1567
02:48:25,522 --> 02:48:30,725
I made a note of the time and I got up to see that truck making a delivery.

1568
02:48:34,685 --> 02:48:50,851
even if we do allow a certain amount of time or a time window from seven in the morning, eight in the morning, nine in the morning until 10 o'clock at night, what is gonna happen?

1569
02:48:50,891 --> 02:48:55,753
Are those hours going to be extended because of unforeseen circumstances?

1570
02:48:55,813 --> 02:49:02,436
Are we gonna have trucks coming in earlier than the time that we do agree on, trucks staying later?

1571
02:49:03,107 --> 02:49:04,527
than the time we agree on.

1572
02:49:05,368 --> 02:49:18,272
So in wrapping everything up, I think that we would like to find a balance and we're not, we're not against having a review period and confirming that everything will be in line.

1573
02:49:20,113 --> 02:49:20,433
Thank you.

1574
02:49:20,813 --> 02:49:22,994
Thank you.

1575
02:49:23,174 --> 02:49:23,554
Thank you.

1576
02:49:23,634 --> 02:49:24,474
President Carviel.

1577
02:49:24,974 --> 02:49:27,295
Maybe we could get addressed the trash pickup.

1578
02:49:33,663 --> 02:49:37,525
Good evening, Elaine Mastracola, 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway.

1579
02:49:38,185 --> 02:49:40,606
I live on the 9th floor, Overlooking Wegmans.

1580
02:49:41,346 --> 02:49:43,647
I'm delighted that they're there.

1581
02:49:43,667 --> 02:49:45,708
I was thinking of going for a job.

1582
02:49:46,008 --> 02:49:51,110
I don't know if they hire old ladies, but I'm delighted they're there.

1583
02:49:51,744 --> 02:49:58,610
But I respectfully submit that I would request we keep the status quo with the hours.

1584
02:49:59,231 --> 02:50:04,395
And if Wayman really cares about community, they will adhere to the 7 to 11 as well.

1585
02:50:04,455 --> 02:50:05,236
Thank you very much.

1586
02:50:15,034 --> 02:50:22,197
First, I'd like to express our appreciation for all the accolades from the various individuals that just came up before us.

1587
02:50:22,817 --> 02:50:24,177
As far as Ms.

1588
02:50:24,518 --> 02:50:35,722
Councilwoman, I'd be glad to address a number of the questions that were raised beyond the trash collection, if you'd like, but starting specifically that we do not have overnight pickup of refugees at all.

1589
02:50:36,922 --> 02:50:37,322
Great.

1590
02:50:37,342 --> 02:50:42,047
And I'd be glad to go down and support it from my best recall of the trustee.

1591
02:50:42,167 --> 02:50:46,611
I'm sorry, maybe not a pickup, but do they have a compactor that works?

1592
02:50:47,451 --> 02:50:53,176
Our compactor is up against the building and enclosed what we feed it from the inside of the store.

1593
02:50:53,377 --> 02:50:54,197
So there is no noise.

1594
02:50:54,237 --> 02:50:54,558
Correct.

1595
02:50:54,838 --> 02:50:55,158
Thank you.

1596
02:50:55,178 --> 02:50:55,478
Thank you.

1597
02:50:56,499 --> 02:51:03,085
And once again, Mr. President, if you'd like, I can go down the list the best I can recall of the number of comments and questions.

1598
02:51:03,125 --> 02:51:03,265
Yeah.

1599
02:51:05,363 --> 02:51:06,685
So we just answered the refuge.

1600
02:51:06,705 --> 02:51:09,708
There is no overnight refuge or pickup.

1601
02:51:10,469 --> 02:51:20,302
As far as the security, we do have, in fact, a very intensive security staff supplemented by the police.

1602
02:51:20,882 --> 02:51:27,429
local police department that are in this and partial on the site for Wegmans specifically from 4 p.m.

1603
02:51:27,489 --> 02:51:28,050
to midnight.

1604
02:51:28,150 --> 02:51:39,361
So here again and one just one other factor where Wegmans is helping the community out in the area of security well beyond just being here as a good neighbor.

1605
02:51:41,723 --> 02:51:42,624
In addition to that

1606
02:51:46,376 --> 02:51:47,377
The backup alarms.

1607
02:51:47,637 --> 02:51:53,421
I mean, there is technology out there that you have more of a swish thing rather than the high audible that was referred to.

1608
02:51:54,181 --> 02:51:56,483
That's something that we can certainly look into.

1609
02:51:56,623 --> 02:52:02,968
And if it's available, which I believe the technology there, we can incorporate that into our program.

1610
02:52:03,997 --> 02:52:14,764
As far as condo values, our experience is, whether we're there before or after, when people know there's a wetness, the property values typically are increased.

1611
02:52:14,844 --> 02:52:24,411
We've never had any indication in the 93 stores we have that there's been a decrease in the values of real estate, more specifically residential, against us.

1612
02:52:24,471 --> 02:52:32,676
In fact, we've had places that we've been building, the condos came up after the fact, and they jumped in price, realizing that road use is coming into place.

1613
02:52:34,146 --> 02:52:37,387
As far as the use, obviously, we're a special permit.

1614
02:52:38,287 --> 02:52:44,329
We understand that in an industrialized zone, a more intensive use than is technically permitted on this parcel.

1615
02:52:44,349 --> 02:52:49,531
We ask that that be a very key consideration in this.

1616
02:52:51,432 --> 02:52:58,934
We need to remain competitive.

1617
02:52:59,594 --> 02:53:01,155
As you've probably read in the papers,

1618
02:53:02,383 --> 02:53:06,664
The grocery business is becoming more and more competitive for a number of reasons.

1619
02:53:07,505 --> 02:53:12,466
And this here is another factor that allows us to remain competitive and remain more flexible.

1620
02:53:12,926 --> 02:53:22,009
We've heard all the comments, and we respect very sincerely and deeply the comments made by councilmen and women, as well as the residents about the noise.

1621
02:53:22,089 --> 02:53:25,310
And that's here again, I cannot overemphasize our commitment

1622
02:53:25,870 --> 02:53:43,516
to be in compliance with code, noise ordinance or otherwise, should there be an issue, we respect and expect and will deal responsibly to the town officials, whether it be here again the council or building inspector, et cetera.

1623
02:53:44,376 --> 02:53:48,318
And we will have ongoing dialogue with the neighbors and take that into consideration.

1624
02:53:49,425 --> 02:54:08,060
The overall conclusion, though, in all of this, hearing the potential scenarios that were offered by both council as well as citizens, we ask that, at minimal, focusing on the central application, that we have the store open and operating from 6 a.m.

1625
02:54:08,200 --> 02:54:08,800
till midnight.

1626
02:54:08,861 --> 02:54:10,001
We ask that be the key.

1627
02:54:10,962 --> 02:54:20,353
Should there be a desire to have some kind of restriction beyond our self-restriction of no overnight deliveries, then we bring the deliveries from 6 a.m.

1628
02:54:20,373 --> 02:54:20,633
to 11 p.m.

1629
02:54:23,531 --> 02:54:36,474
So this is a consideration for the board out of appreciation to all the comments and not to extend the meeting to the wee hours of the morning for the sake of obviously the council and the citizens.

1630
02:54:36,795 --> 02:54:38,195
But here again, one indication.

1631
02:54:38,535 --> 02:54:42,396
But to remain successful in a competitive market, we need to remain flexible.

1632
02:54:42,776 --> 02:54:44,497
We have to have the hours of operations.

1633
02:54:44,557 --> 02:54:45,437
It's very critical.

1634
02:54:45,837 --> 02:54:49,518
And there's no guarantee that just because we're Wegmans that we're successful.

1635
02:54:50,358 --> 02:54:56,282
Rochester knows very well the implications of not remaining competitive, not staying ahead of the eight ball.

1636
02:54:56,622 --> 02:54:59,284
Kodak has come and gone for all practical purposes.

1637
02:54:59,704 --> 02:55:01,806
Bauschenlam is fighting for its life.

1638
02:55:02,326 --> 02:55:03,807
Xerox has been split up.

1639
02:55:04,448 --> 02:55:09,131
Here's the point, you always have to be in front of the game, more ever flexible.

1640
02:55:10,384 --> 02:55:13,667
with respect for the community so you can give back to the community.

1641
02:55:14,488 --> 02:55:18,332
There is no guarantee that we could be here if we're not successful.

1642
02:55:18,772 --> 02:55:21,855
So it's a benefit to them all, to the community, and certainly to our business.

1643
02:55:22,976 --> 02:55:26,440
I'll be glad to address any of the questions that I haven't been brought up.

1644
02:55:30,313 --> 02:55:34,854
As far as, here again, one other point that the store manager, Kevin Russell, pointed out to me.

1645
02:55:35,534 --> 02:55:40,915
If a trucker comes there and he's outside the hours or close to the hours, then he should not be there.

1646
02:55:40,955 --> 02:55:47,056
Because we're going to dictate, if we do have 11 to 12, you cannot come at 10 minutes of 12.

1647
02:55:47,136 --> 02:55:49,497
You cannot be there a quarter of, et cetera.

1648
02:55:49,857 --> 02:55:55,798
You have to leave the site now, go back to the throwaway, and station it there, wherever that weigh station is, number one.

1649
02:55:56,534 --> 02:56:00,997
Number two, when our trucks come here, our cabs are turned off.

1650
02:56:01,878 --> 02:56:03,459
So that engine is not running.

1651
02:56:03,519 --> 02:56:07,942
I know there's some people who have thought, we've heard, expressed concerns about the cab running.

1652
02:56:08,002 --> 02:56:10,063
That engine is turned off as it comes in.

1653
02:56:10,824 --> 02:56:13,485
The refrigeration units, when they're there, yes, they're on.

1654
02:56:13,525 --> 02:56:17,068
But they are no different than the refrigeration units that are on the building.

1655
02:56:17,128 --> 02:56:18,469
So in essence, it's the same.

1656
02:56:19,009 --> 02:56:21,009
mechanical operation that's on the building.

1657
02:56:21,330 --> 02:56:28,151
And I go back to the initial concern that was expressed by Mr. Councilman about the units on the HVAC units.

1658
02:56:28,171 --> 02:56:35,132
I'm not sure which particular unit that the individual was concerned about or which one the noise emanating has come from.

1659
02:56:35,613 --> 02:56:41,434
We will certainly work with the city, look at it, look at the specs, and if there's a mitigation measure, we would incorporate it.

1660
02:56:41,454 --> 02:56:41,974
Yes.

1661
02:56:43,525 --> 02:56:44,145
Councilor Falwell.

1662
02:56:44,666 --> 02:56:45,386
Thank you, Mr. President.

1663
02:56:45,406 --> 02:56:46,687
I'm just curious.

1664
02:56:46,747 --> 02:56:52,430
As far as when the trucks come to make deliveries, will they be coming all in one direction?

1665
02:56:52,450 --> 02:56:55,171
Like, will they be coming from Locust Street or the parkway?

1666
02:56:55,211 --> 02:56:57,732
Which way would they be approaching the back of the building?

1667
02:56:58,453 --> 02:57:03,195
Quite frankly, I don't know if we have that specific on that, but Kevin might have more details.

1668
02:57:03,930 --> 02:57:04,230
Hi, folks.

1669
02:57:04,270 --> 02:57:05,951
Kevin Russell, store manager at Wegmans.

1670
02:57:07,571 --> 02:57:18,694
What I envision, and I'm not a professional truck driver, but looking at the property, I would say the one that makes the most sense would come off Locust and go around the side of Marshalls and come across the back in that direction.

1671
02:57:19,354 --> 02:57:22,615
I'm not sure if they're on the Mystic Valley Parkway, if they could really turn a right.

1672
02:57:22,995 --> 02:57:23,735
It's pretty sharp.

1673
02:57:24,525 --> 02:57:28,448
And again, I mean, these folks are professionals, and they might be able to get it in there.

1674
02:57:28,508 --> 02:57:31,249
I couldn't do it, but I think it'll come around the backside.

1675
02:57:31,409 --> 02:57:33,511
And if we say that's the way you have to come, that's the way you come.

1676
02:57:33,631 --> 02:57:41,135
I was the store manager in Burlington, and I don't know if anybody's been up there and seen the third item project, but we said, let's not have trucks come in on first, second, or third.

1677
02:57:41,175 --> 02:57:41,976
We'll come in on fourth.

1678
02:57:42,957 --> 02:57:49,941
That way, they're able to navigate and negotiate much easier, and it's easier on the pavement, too, in an area like that.

1679
02:57:51,155 --> 02:57:51,855
That's what we do there.

1680
02:57:52,736 --> 02:57:57,497
I'm just thinking if you come around that side of the building, it probably might get a little bit quieter.

1681
02:57:57,577 --> 02:58:00,438
But so thank you for your answer.

1682
02:58:00,458 --> 02:58:09,762
Now, with regard to the compactor, I believe the compactor has some sort of, I think when you hit the button, it starts to compact.

1683
02:58:09,862 --> 02:58:10,742
Is that pretty loud?

1684
02:58:11,042 --> 02:58:13,663
I used to work in a store when I was back in college.

1685
02:58:13,683 --> 02:58:15,044
I knew that seemed to be pretty loud.

1686
02:58:17,042 --> 02:58:18,904
I personally don't believe that it's loud.

1687
02:58:18,964 --> 02:58:24,909
I've worked with wagons 31 years and used the compactor, I don't even know how many, probably hundreds of thousands of times.

1688
02:58:25,850 --> 02:58:29,093
It's louder on the inside because you're actually there with the mechanics.

1689
02:58:29,433 --> 02:58:34,778
When you hit that button, there's a big ram that pushes out and compacts the garbage.

1690
02:58:34,838 --> 02:58:36,200
On the outside, it's much different.

1691
02:58:37,149 --> 02:58:38,909
And last question.

1692
02:58:39,089 --> 02:58:44,371
We could certainly restrict the hours on that operationally wise.

1693
02:58:45,331 --> 02:58:51,652
Yeah, typically overnight we'll have grocery stocking that takes place and they're really generating cardboard, not waste.

1694
02:58:52,132 --> 02:58:56,353
So that goes inside a bale or inside the building that you wouldn't even know existed from the outside.

1695
02:58:56,593 --> 02:58:56,793
Okay.

1696
02:58:57,894 --> 02:59:03,195
And as far as, actually no, you already answered the question.

1697
02:59:08,285 --> 02:59:16,648
Can you address the gentleman's comment, Mr. Cipriani's comment about the truck coming in at 3.05 this morning?

1698
02:59:17,408 --> 02:59:18,049
I'm not aware of it.

1699
02:59:18,109 --> 02:59:19,569
This is the first I've heard.

1700
02:59:19,589 --> 02:59:22,470
That's definitely a road tractor trailer.

1701
02:59:23,890 --> 02:59:27,932
I'd be surprised if we don't have a receiver that early in the morning.

1702
02:59:29,517 --> 02:59:32,578
We're not up in operation now, so I can't speak to who that was.

1703
02:59:32,678 --> 02:59:36,680
I know we did receive a number of complaints in talking to our construction folks.

1704
02:59:36,720 --> 02:59:39,201
We had received it from a number of the neighbors.

1705
02:59:39,241 --> 02:59:44,663
But my understanding is those were construction vehicles as part of the overall site construction.

1706
02:59:45,223 --> 02:59:54,910
But I can assure you, again, that there are roads, in this particular case, especially coming down to the line with Petco opening up and Dixon, you know, we're coming down with the wire.

1707
02:59:54,971 --> 03:00:01,816
But that's an anomaly that something that, here again, if we hear something like that, it'll be shut down very quickly.

1708
03:00:01,836 --> 03:00:02,977
It'll be addressed immediately.

1709
03:00:04,279 --> 03:00:08,201
I also wanted to mention that so the property really isn't turned over to us yet.

1710
03:00:08,281 --> 03:00:10,823
Yes, it will be us as of November, November 5th.

1711
03:00:10,863 --> 03:00:11,683
We'll run that building.

1712
03:00:12,444 --> 03:00:14,805
As you know, New England Development was the developer.

1713
03:00:15,105 --> 03:00:19,608
EMJ actually runs that construction site may have been something that they ordered in.

1714
03:00:19,708 --> 03:00:23,030
But as Art said, we don't have a receiver on that property until 7 a.m.

1715
03:00:24,898 --> 03:00:28,621
They may have had 28 cash registers come in from North Carolina.

1716
03:00:28,761 --> 03:00:32,043
They got here early, thought it was OK to park behind the store, pulled in.

1717
03:00:32,203 --> 03:00:34,084
I don't know if that unit continued to run.

1718
03:00:34,464 --> 03:00:35,885
I know nothing about that delivery.

1719
03:00:35,985 --> 03:00:41,748
But I can guarantee you that if we say we won't have folks after 11 or before 6, it won't happen.

1720
03:00:43,269 --> 03:00:43,589
Thank you.

1721
03:00:47,132 --> 03:00:48,913
Further comments from the audience?

1722
03:00:50,173 --> 03:00:50,594
Yes, you may.

1723
03:00:52,887 --> 03:00:53,887
Name and address of the record.

1724
03:00:53,907 --> 03:00:56,629
Andrew Castanetti, Cushman Street, Method, Massachusetts.

1725
03:00:57,569 --> 03:01:06,333
Patiently, I've been listening, and I'd like to offer a few words, knowing that you can never satisfy all the people all the time.

1726
03:01:07,333 --> 03:01:11,975
However, I believe that is still an industrial zone, not residential.

1727
03:01:13,136 --> 03:01:17,638
And also, the old saying goes, competition usually makes better business.

1728
03:01:18,796 --> 03:01:29,038
So the more competition, it would definitely be better for the consumer, I presume, lowering the prices, maybe stopping shop or lower the usury prices.

1729
03:01:29,618 --> 03:01:45,302
As a matter of fact, it might be a great idea to, instead of the 490 unit proposed development across the street, which is tied up in two or three lawsuits, that market basket goes in there.

1730
03:01:47,072 --> 03:01:48,733
and then we could really lower some prices.

1731
03:01:49,813 --> 03:01:50,654
Thank you for listening.

1732
03:01:51,674 --> 03:02:00,359
Thank you.

1733
03:02:00,379 --> 03:02:01,219
Come on down, Frank.

1734
03:02:03,541 --> 03:02:04,661
Name and address of the record, please.

1735
03:02:04,861 --> 03:02:06,022
My name is Frank Bankey.

1736
03:02:06,302 --> 03:02:14,006
I am a trustee and I happen to be chairman of the board of trustees at 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway, which is the abutting property.

1737
03:02:15,047 --> 03:02:15,147
Um,

1738
03:02:17,413 --> 03:02:21,056
professor to speak for everybody in the building.

1739
03:02:21,856 --> 03:02:22,477
Nobody can.

1740
03:02:22,857 --> 03:02:24,018
Nobody has that authority.

1741
03:02:24,979 --> 03:02:27,300
I'm here to speak for myself, but I'll say one thing.

1742
03:02:27,781 --> 03:02:36,747
I don't think anybody can dispute the fact that I get around the building probably more than anyone else because I happen to be retired and I know a lot of people and I do speak with them.

1743
03:02:37,548 --> 03:02:41,031
I can honestly say I have never had anybody say to me

1744
03:02:41,591 --> 03:02:42,951
that they were against Wegmans.

1745
03:02:43,632 --> 03:02:44,992
Welcome them with open arms.

1746
03:02:45,012 --> 03:02:46,413
We're excited to get them.

1747
03:02:46,773 --> 03:02:48,453
But there are some concerns.

1748
03:02:49,154 --> 03:02:55,656
And some of those concerns would affect me because I am on the side that abuts the back of the building.

1749
03:02:56,856 --> 03:03:07,680
Now today, the Honorable President of the Board made reference that one of the members of the Board of Trustees met with people from Wegmans, and that happened to be me.

1750
03:03:09,896 --> 03:03:13,659
We did have, I thought, a very productive meeting.

1751
03:03:14,780 --> 03:03:21,306
Many of the things, like we've heard about the great contributions that Wegmans has made to the community at large, but I'll tell you,

1752
03:03:22,250 --> 03:03:32,812
They were more than happy to support a resolution that the president of this city council is going to propose at the next meeting that I'm asking for his support.

1753
03:03:33,693 --> 03:03:41,875
And that is, I think the people who live in our building can appreciate the poor condition of the sidewalk in front of our building.

1754
03:03:41,895 --> 03:03:47,616
It's particularly that section that leads from our driveway over to Wegmans.

1755
03:03:48,724 --> 03:03:53,585
There's a lack of adequate lighting, and the trees are overhanging.

1756
03:03:54,025 --> 03:04:03,347
Now, I today contacted the office of Senator Pat Jalen, who I've known for a long time, and I said that I would like to get some support from the local community.

1757
03:04:03,927 --> 03:04:06,248
And your president, Timothy Boyd, jumped right on it.

1758
03:04:06,328 --> 03:04:07,408
He said, be glad to do it.

1759
03:04:07,448 --> 03:04:09,048
I'll sponsor it for you at the next meeting.

1760
03:04:09,608 --> 03:04:12,929
And the people from Wegmans, when I spoke with them, glad to do it.

1761
03:04:14,707 --> 03:04:17,250
That's what we want to be, is we want to be good neighbors.

1762
03:04:17,270 --> 03:04:18,851
We want it to be a two-way street.

1763
03:04:18,932 --> 03:04:22,656
We want to be able to go over and speak with the people there.

1764
03:04:22,676 --> 03:04:24,738
A couple of other issues that came up.

1765
03:04:26,881 --> 03:04:31,125
You people are going to have, when I say you people, I mean Wegmans, is going to have 24-hour security.

1766
03:04:32,847 --> 03:04:35,550
Now that bolsters our security.

1767
03:04:36,131 --> 03:04:47,202
First day I took office as the chairman, I ordered the security guards at nighttime to make rounds of the building so that we have increased visibility with the security people.

1768
03:04:47,983 --> 03:04:51,586
And now if we have the, I understand that the people from

1769
03:04:53,165 --> 03:04:55,046
Brinkman's are going to be outside as well.

1770
03:04:55,406 --> 03:04:57,626
So that gives us another degree of security.

1771
03:04:57,666 --> 03:04:59,607
I think at least on that side of the building.

1772
03:05:00,587 --> 03:05:04,968
There have been some pretty good issues here raised tonight about the picking up of trash, and it is loud.

1773
03:05:05,008 --> 03:05:05,749
It is loud.

1774
03:05:06,889 --> 03:05:09,990
And I'm talking about the compressor that we have on our own property.

1775
03:05:10,510 --> 03:05:17,132
Certainly something can be done to probably abate that, whether there's some kind of muffler systems or whether

1776
03:05:18,270 --> 03:05:22,234
We could have scheduled pickups during normal business hours, not through the night.

1777
03:05:22,254 --> 03:05:27,139
I understand that these types of things, according to the law, they're able to come in.

1778
03:05:27,219 --> 03:05:29,521
I know in Somerville that they have problems with that.

1779
03:05:29,561 --> 03:05:36,768
They can come in commercial people and empty dumpsters at all times of the day and night.

1780
03:05:36,788 --> 03:05:38,950
I came here tonight with the

1781
03:05:39,765 --> 03:05:43,566
you know, expectation that you people were going to vote on it.

1782
03:05:43,706 --> 03:05:47,046
I have no problem with going with the normal scheduled hours.

1783
03:05:47,526 --> 03:06:05,930
I heard Councilor Knight come up with what I thought was a pretty good proposal and that was to put it on, I don't know if the correct term was to put it on the table or hold it in abeyance for a period of time so that if there are particular complaints, certainly people in my building are not bashful about expressing their complaints.

1784
03:06:06,796 --> 03:06:13,478
They would contact either, hopefully they would let us know on the board, but they would also contact Wegmans as well.

1785
03:06:14,339 --> 03:06:22,021
But I'm one person who is extremely excited and grateful to have this new business coming into our neighborhood.

1786
03:06:22,561 --> 03:06:32,605
They've done a heck of a job on the front of that building, and when you think of what's left there, no disparaging Kohl's, but the way the brick and mortar stores are going, I don't know how much longer Kohl's is gonna last.

1787
03:06:33,365 --> 03:06:39,047
And if that falls under, and we didn't do anything about bringing white men in, we'd have a dust bowl over there.

1788
03:06:39,087 --> 03:06:41,228
We'd probably have cops down there all the time.

1789
03:06:41,568 --> 03:06:51,452
Speaking of which, and I worked for the Somerville police for 28 years, if ever there was a violation of any kind that somebody suspects

1790
03:06:52,232 --> 03:06:56,655
they should call the police, and the police will come down and stop the delivery.

1791
03:06:57,175 --> 03:07:18,589
And also, when the police department responds to a call, they are required to keep a record of that call, so that if we came back in 30 days or 90 days, it's very simple to go down to the police station, any one of us, and ask for a copy of the calls that were received by the police for the response they had to May 39, to, wait,

1792
03:07:21,397 --> 03:07:25,823
So I don't want to be here and frustrate Wegmans from coming in.

1793
03:07:26,183 --> 03:07:27,966
I think everybody here really is for them.

1794
03:07:28,627 --> 03:07:34,795
And I think with your cooperation, your guidance, I'm sure we can have a great relationship with them.

1795
03:07:34,855 --> 03:07:36,397
I know that I've spoken with them today.

1796
03:07:36,417 --> 03:07:37,118
They're going to do some.

1797
03:07:39,037 --> 03:07:44,004
shrubbery work for us, and they're going to help us out with some property concerns that we have.

1798
03:07:44,925 --> 03:07:53,878
Again, I'm excited about getting this front sidewalk fixed, and the trees trimmed, and adequate lighting, and it's going to be safe for people to go back and forth.

1799
03:07:54,759 --> 03:08:03,381
And in closing, I do want to thank you very much, Mr. President, and the honorable members of the board for allowing us to come here this evening.

1800
03:08:03,781 --> 03:08:08,422
A little tough there during the beginning day, you know, with the long hearings there.

1801
03:08:09,163 --> 03:08:10,663
But this was productive.

1802
03:08:10,683 --> 03:08:11,383
It was worth the wait.

1803
03:08:11,403 --> 03:08:13,164
But thank you very much.

1804
03:08:13,624 --> 03:08:14,784
I was in this business.

1805
03:08:14,844 --> 03:08:15,624
I know how boring that is.

1806
03:08:25,733 --> 03:08:28,115
Mr. President, Council Members, if I might.

1807
03:08:28,195 --> 03:08:33,039
So we've heard a lot tonight from obviously the Council and the neighbors.

1808
03:08:34,020 --> 03:08:38,624
Here again, back to the original application asking for hours of operations 6 a.m.

1809
03:08:38,684 --> 03:08:39,225
to midnight.

1810
03:08:39,285 --> 03:08:40,145
We ask that that

1811
03:08:41,137 --> 03:08:51,186
We voted on with consideration that we will not only self-restrict overnight, but if the board chooses to restrict deliveries between 11 p.m.

1812
03:08:51,606 --> 03:08:53,068
and 6 p.m., that we feel

1813
03:08:58,954 --> 03:09:12,046
We feel that that is a situation where it's very clear in its cast in stone where we heard the resonance, we respected the resonance primarily at the end of the night, end of the day, if you will.

1814
03:09:13,217 --> 03:09:18,500
Albeit it restricts us, and Corey Frank, I'll tell you the challenge is now here again, and not to belabor it, with the weather.

1815
03:09:18,540 --> 03:09:28,745
Ideally, we'd get both together with hours of operations, 6 to midnight, and deliveries, because the weather, and it's not something that I fabricate this, but we feel it's going to happen.

1816
03:09:29,745 --> 03:09:40,253
Possibly with the weather and traffic and then we don't want the frustration with the neighbors the council and certainly else but with that said We'd appreciate an offer if they would 6 a.m.

1817
03:09:40,273 --> 03:09:47,338
To midnight for hours of operation and then concurrent with that restrict of deliveries of tractor trailers in the back from 11 p.m.

1818
03:09:47,358 --> 03:09:47,578
Till 6 a.m

1819
03:09:50,320 --> 03:09:51,441
Councillor Layton.

1820
03:09:51,541 --> 03:09:53,202
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

1821
03:09:53,222 --> 03:09:54,403
I appreciate it.

1822
03:09:54,443 --> 03:10:04,831
Sir, can you please explain to me a little bit more about what Mr. Bakey was discussing, some of these contingencies and some of these commitments that you've made to the Condo Association over there, so we have a better understanding?

1823
03:10:04,851 --> 03:10:06,773
Yeah, I'll have to defer to Mr. Dugney.

1824
03:10:06,793 --> 03:10:09,915
I believe he's referring to site improvements, that New England development.

1825
03:10:09,955 --> 03:10:13,538
That's, once again, it's a tenant, so that was New England development.

1826
03:10:20,106 --> 03:10:21,447
Thank you, Councilor.

1827
03:10:22,168 --> 03:10:23,989
Again, Brian Dugdale from Goulston Stores.

1828
03:10:26,051 --> 03:10:28,894
There were commitments that have been made.

1829
03:10:28,914 --> 03:10:34,138
I think we went through a lot of them previously in terms of there will be sealed loading docks.

1830
03:10:34,158 --> 03:10:38,382
In terms of the landscape offer, there will be additional planting that's done between

1831
03:10:39,266 --> 03:10:44,809
the mall property and the condo property, as well as a fence that's going to gate off.

1832
03:10:44,829 --> 03:10:51,373
There's a, I don't want to get too lost in the weeds, but there's a driveway that leads right in between the two properties and there's an entrance.

1833
03:10:51,393 --> 03:10:56,175
That's going to be gated off to ensure that there'll be no truck access from the condo side.

1834
03:10:56,616 --> 03:10:58,817
Everything will be coming through the mall property.

1835
03:10:59,717 --> 03:11:01,118
We've agreed to give additional funding.

1836
03:11:01,138 --> 03:11:10,542
The amount's still to be determined, but that funding's going to be used to plant an additional layer of shrubs, buffer-type landscaping improvements on the condo side of the property.

1837
03:11:11,422 --> 03:11:18,366
In terms of security, I'm not sure that exactly it's going to be 24-hour security, but there is going to be security both through Wegmans and the mall.

1838
03:11:18,386 --> 03:11:22,407
There's going to be two layers of security, and there will be monitoring, I believe.

1839
03:11:22,447 --> 03:11:24,668
And Wegmans, correct me if I'm wrong, but 24-7 with cameras.

1840
03:11:26,489 --> 03:11:38,873
And again, the other commitment, the two other commitments that were discussed, there will be a designated representative, so it's going to be very easy to get in touch with both the ownership of the mall as well as Wegmans to address any of these issues.

1841
03:11:38,934 --> 03:11:42,915
And then the other thing that we were talking about earlier is just the condition of the sidewalk.

1842
03:11:43,715 --> 03:11:44,936
Mr. Bakey was referring to.

1843
03:11:45,276 --> 03:11:50,880
It's along Mystic Valley Parkway, which unfortunately is owned by the Department of Conservation and Recreation.

1844
03:11:50,920 --> 03:12:06,410
So we don't have the ability to actually do those improvements, but we would be more than happy to support any sort of a resolution of this council or any actions taken by Mr. Bakey himself to try to get some sort of funding and attention on that matter.

1845
03:12:07,653 --> 03:12:14,595
The reason I ask, Mr. Dungill, is because I think that based upon what we're hearing from the residents, that they want to be a good neighbor.

1846
03:12:15,015 --> 03:12:16,876
They want to be a partner with Wegmans.

1847
03:12:17,096 --> 03:12:22,777
And I think they realize that Wegmans is going to be there for a long time, provided that they have tools to be successful.

1848
03:12:25,678 --> 03:12:35,544
Concessions that have been made, I think, are very important to gaining the support of the residents of 3920 Mystic Valley Parkway and their efforts to be in favor of extended hours.

1849
03:12:36,104 --> 03:12:42,388
And I was hoping maybe that we could get these criteria outlined so that we could include them as conditions in the special permit.

1850
03:12:43,348 --> 03:12:48,671
Because the way that I'm looking at it, I think, is that people don't seem to have too much concern over the front of the house.

1851
03:12:48,811 --> 03:12:52,814
They're not too worried about the hours of operation being 6 o'clock in the morning till midnight in the front of the house.

1852
03:12:53,274 --> 03:12:54,935
The concerns are really on the loading in the back.

1853
03:12:55,575 --> 03:13:04,361
And, you know, the request that's before us this evening is to allow a 6 to 12 operation in the front of the house and allow a 6 to 11 o'clock at night operation in the back of the house.

1854
03:13:05,222 --> 03:13:10,186
I, for one, am a little bit more comfortable with the status quo operation in the back of the house.

1855
03:13:10,961 --> 03:13:13,142
and with the 6 to 12 operation in the front of the house.

1856
03:13:13,922 --> 03:13:16,723
But I think it would be very important that we get these criteria included.

1857
03:13:16,743 --> 03:13:35,648
I'd make the motion, Mr. President, to support the special permit, provided that there are restrictions that are placed upon it, one of them being that these special conditions and concessions that have been made by the developer and the condominium association are included as an addendum to the special permit.

1858
03:13:36,528 --> 03:13:46,155
that the hours are restricted for deliveries from status quo 7 to 11 in the back, and that we allow the permit to go forward for 6 to 12 in the front for the operations of the house, Mr. President.

1859
03:13:46,655 --> 03:13:57,803
I also have a concern about the permit being issued in perpetuity, and I think that there should be a review placed on it, and I also think that the permit should go with the petitioner and not the property.

1860
03:13:58,423 --> 03:14:04,267
So those are some of the concerns that I have, and I think that with these parameters, I'd be comfortable voting for this.

1861
03:14:09,266 --> 03:14:15,575
I think they're more concerned, it's probably the beginning hours more than the back hours for deliveries.

1862
03:14:15,615 --> 03:14:21,643
Because most of their break and things like that are all coming in the morning versus in the afternoon.

1863
03:14:21,844 --> 03:14:24,147
So I think they're concerned it's more of the.

1864
03:14:25,288 --> 03:14:29,832
The front of the hour versus the back of the hour.

1865
03:14:29,852 --> 03:14:32,615
I don't know if they want to address that.

1866
03:14:32,635 --> 03:14:40,762
Mr. President, I don't want to speak for Whiteman's, but just to be clear, we're happy to accommodate any of those conditions as part of the condition of the special permit, with that exception.

1867
03:14:41,142 --> 03:14:47,348
I think, again, I don't want to speak for Whiteman's, but I think I heard that 6 to 11 is what their request is now in terms of limiting.

1868
03:14:47,368 --> 03:14:47,748
Mr. President?

1869
03:14:52,047 --> 03:15:00,129
Could just a point of clarifications on Councilor Nights, if I may, Mr. President and Chair, to Councilor Nights' summation.

1870
03:15:02,610 --> 03:15:15,353
Now, I understood from the speakers and from the representatives of Westman that there seems to be a consensus that people would be all right with six to 11 in the back of the house.

1871
03:15:16,273 --> 03:15:20,294
And your suggestion was that

1872
03:15:21,557 --> 03:15:22,217
remains status quo.

1873
03:15:22,237 --> 03:15:28,841
That we have a review, that your suggestion is status quo, that we have a review, yes?

1874
03:15:29,221 --> 03:15:29,461
Yes.

1875
03:15:29,941 --> 03:15:30,682
At what point?

1876
03:15:31,162 --> 03:15:31,462
30 days.

1877
03:15:31,482 --> 03:15:32,422
30 days.

1878
03:15:32,562 --> 03:15:33,703
30 days.

1879
03:15:33,723 --> 03:15:39,726
And that we have, that it's tied only to weapons.

1880
03:15:40,006 --> 03:15:40,446
Only to weapons.

1881
03:15:40,466 --> 03:15:41,307
And not to the property.

1882
03:15:41,347 --> 03:15:41,627
Correct.

1883
03:15:43,692 --> 03:15:44,793
Do I have those three points?

1884
03:15:45,033 --> 03:15:46,054
Those three points are correct.

1885
03:15:46,094 --> 03:15:48,916
Hours 6 to 12 in the front of the house, 7 to 11 in the back of the house.

1886
03:15:48,956 --> 03:15:51,077
The permit goes with the petitioner and not with the property.

1887
03:15:51,478 --> 03:15:58,223
And then the criteria that have been outlined and agreed upon between the two parties would be attached as an addendum to the special permit so that we know what's expected.

1888
03:15:58,303 --> 03:15:59,363
And the 30-day review?

1889
03:16:00,144 --> 03:16:02,826
The 30-day review, provided there's no problems with the deliveries.

1890
03:16:02,866 --> 03:16:12,213
Maybe we can look at extending the hours of deliveries and the hours of operation in the back of the house, provided that there's no problems from the deliveries during the status quo hours.

1891
03:16:12,873 --> 03:16:14,034
Thank you, Mr President.

1892
03:16:14,054 --> 03:16:15,456
Thank you for your time.

1893
03:16:15,476 --> 03:16:16,056
Thank you.

1894
03:16:16,296 --> 03:16:16,617
Thank you.

1895
03:16:16,657 --> 03:16:29,029
I just also like it noted on the as a condition to make sure there's no trash pickup in the back during the evening hours, the night hours from at least 11 to 6 in the morning.

1896
03:16:29,877 --> 03:16:37,683
You would want to address that to the developer, because there are four other companies besides Wegmans that pick up trash.

1897
03:16:38,724 --> 03:16:41,526
Wegmans is saying that they will not have any trash pick up.

1898
03:16:41,726 --> 03:16:45,108
Again, that doesn't address the Dicks, Marshalls, Coles.

1899
03:16:45,168 --> 03:16:46,129
They're not before us right now.

1900
03:16:46,149 --> 03:16:46,830
Wegmans is before us.

1901
03:16:46,950 --> 03:16:49,251
I know, but Wegmans has said they will not have any trash pick up.

1902
03:16:49,271 --> 03:16:53,394
I don't know if we can make that a condition to make sure that stays that way.

1903
03:16:56,775 --> 03:16:59,097
And Mr. President, if I might, back to the 6 a.m.

1904
03:16:59,137 --> 03:17:01,719
hours of operation to midnight hours of operation.

1905
03:17:01,739 --> 03:17:04,040
We still, once again, request that.

1906
03:17:04,220 --> 03:17:07,923
And then back to the deliveries, to the point of being freshness here again.

1907
03:17:07,943 --> 03:17:13,367
We're trying to get product, fresh product there, out there before our customers come in.

1908
03:17:13,387 --> 03:17:17,150
And that extra hour goes a long way to allow us to get a private.

1909
03:17:17,630 --> 03:17:21,253
And I think it was made mention that my ears heard, because I think some counsel

1910
03:17:21,753 --> 03:17:25,335
folks that the residents seem to support the 6 a.m.

1911
03:17:25,595 --> 03:17:28,297
They definitely did not like the evening.

1912
03:17:28,337 --> 03:17:35,260
We heard that very loud and clear, not speaking for each and every one of the residents, but I thought that's what I heard and it's on record.

1913
03:17:35,881 --> 03:17:40,243
So we ask that that be modified for consideration of a 6 a.m.

1914
03:17:40,723 --> 03:17:41,764
to 11 p.m.

1915
03:17:41,884 --> 03:17:42,844
for the deliveries.

1916
03:17:45,126 --> 03:17:47,387
Through the chair, would you be willing to go to 10 p.m.? ?

1917
03:17:49,440 --> 03:17:54,222
That's taking a step backwards and really being problematic for operations to put them on.

1918
03:17:54,262 --> 03:18:00,563
We already have had, even last week, I've had conversations with our distribution transportation groups.

1919
03:18:01,024 --> 03:18:04,185
They are reconsidering all of Massachusetts and all the programs.

1920
03:18:04,225 --> 03:18:08,126
That's how strapped we are with the tight program of 7-Eleven.

1921
03:18:10,326 --> 03:18:12,467
That would be more than problematic.

1922
03:18:14,246 --> 03:18:14,946
Vice-President Moxx.

1923
03:18:15,927 --> 03:18:24,991
Mr. President, if I could, I think the compromise that the gentleman is stating from 6 to 11 is a compromise.

1924
03:18:26,452 --> 03:18:30,754
As Councillor Knight mentioned about putting a 30-day review

1925
03:18:31,554 --> 03:18:33,395
And I'd like to see maybe a 30-, 60-, or 90-day review.

1926
03:18:33,455 --> 03:18:35,217
I'd like to see them all.

1927
03:18:35,957 --> 03:18:42,922
And then we can take a look at it to talk to the residents of Mr. Condos to see how it's working.

1928
03:18:43,522 --> 03:18:47,945
And the condition is only based on the reviews.

1929
03:18:48,686 --> 03:18:59,293
So if within 30 days, sir, if we get a number of complaints about the trucking and so forth, we can withdraw the extended

1930
03:19:01,917 --> 03:19:09,799
not overstating my welcome, but any operation up and running, it takes time to get some of the bugs out of it.

1931
03:19:10,899 --> 03:19:15,500
We have truckers coming into the site that haven't been here before.

1932
03:19:16,420 --> 03:19:25,242
We'd ask them further out than 30 days, whether it be 60 or 90, but just from a more practical, up and running sort of thing, versus out of the gate.

1933
03:19:25,462 --> 03:19:28,083
Hydrogen is obviously a here.

1934
03:19:28,863 --> 03:19:34,825
We're going at a mile a minute sort of thing, with consideration of that factor, that we're going from zero.

1935
03:19:34,845 --> 03:19:45,709
And I trust you'll find from our other experiences with stores, it'll be very successful, thanks to the community, and hopefully, obviously, our customers, including the condo residents.

1936
03:19:46,309 --> 03:19:52,452
It will be going 100 miles an hour, all aspects of the operations, internal and external.

1937
03:19:52,472 --> 03:19:54,192
So we ask that, whether it be 60 or 90,

1938
03:19:56,573 --> 03:20:03,038
30-day, we certainly respect the ultimate goal, but that's, from a very practical point of view, a challenge.

1939
03:20:03,078 --> 03:20:08,362
But at the same time, we're not surrendering at all the recognition that we have to be in compliance.

1940
03:20:09,143 --> 03:20:09,683
COPS on 9.

1941
03:20:11,004 --> 03:20:14,667
This brings me back to my initial point, Mr. President, when I first spoke on the topic.

1942
03:20:14,867 --> 03:20:16,168
We don't know what to expect down there.

1943
03:20:16,648 --> 03:20:20,091
So now we want to go from 7 to 11 to 6 to 12.

1944
03:20:21,072 --> 03:20:23,273
He just said, so we're going to be going 100 miles an hour.

1945
03:20:23,293 --> 03:20:24,975
The first 30 days, it's probably going to be bumpy.

1946
03:20:25,655 --> 03:20:26,837
No, I didn't say that.

1947
03:20:26,997 --> 03:20:31,101
I said it's always a challenge and be very realistic.

1948
03:20:31,441 --> 03:20:41,131
I don't think in any kind of event, any kind of exercise, that giving due process consideration of practical time is somebody's up and running.

1949
03:20:42,012 --> 03:20:44,254
It's just a recognition of reality.

1950
03:20:44,935 --> 03:20:53,299
We are very successful in what we do, but I didn't want to have the town get a false read why anomalies without liars.

1951
03:20:53,899 --> 03:20:54,999
That's my point there.

1952
03:20:55,079 --> 03:21:01,182
And I think as you give a little beyond 30 to 60, we're not trying to duck away from any responsibilities.

1953
03:21:01,262 --> 03:21:07,825
We're trying to fine tune our machine from day one, and we're not rated number one in the industry because we're

1954
03:21:11,292 --> 03:21:17,854
across the board, but I think from the practical point of implementation, that's all I'm asking for a little free board there.

1955
03:21:18,294 --> 03:21:22,215
We respect everything else that goes with that, and if it's 30 days, it's 30 days.

1956
03:21:22,255 --> 03:21:23,995
Certainly, in the end, we respect it.

1957
03:21:24,716 --> 03:21:26,736
But that's all I'm asking for that point of view.

1958
03:21:26,776 --> 03:21:28,857
So if I might, from our point of view, if you could,

1959
03:21:29,737 --> 03:21:37,583
Again, summarizing, I think, what I've said to make sure I'm clear is that 6 to midnight for operations in front, like how you put that, very good.

1960
03:21:38,003 --> 03:21:39,224
The back is 6 to 11.

1961
03:21:40,185 --> 03:21:45,229
And then we ask, if not, if it's 60 or 90 would be considered.

1962
03:21:45,289 --> 03:21:47,470
But certainly, if 30 is 30, that's what it is.

1963
03:21:47,491 --> 03:21:48,932
Well, why don't we do both, Mr. President?

1964
03:21:48,952 --> 03:21:52,594
Because the residents are going to have to live there for the 30 days, and they're going to have to put up with it.

1965
03:21:52,734 --> 03:21:54,055
So why don't we bring them in at 30 and at 90?

1966
03:21:54,856 --> 03:22:01,260
So we can see if the kinks have worked out, if any issues are raised within 30 days that may be attributable.

1967
03:22:01,300 --> 03:22:03,161
A 30-day review and a 90-day review.

1968
03:22:03,181 --> 03:22:03,781
60 and six months.

1969
03:22:04,562 --> 03:22:06,883
We could do that too, but I mean... Let's do three reviews.

1970
03:22:06,903 --> 03:22:06,883
30, 60, 90.

1971
03:22:07,264 --> 03:22:09,805
I'm all for it.

1972
03:22:09,865 --> 03:22:11,406
All for it.

1973
03:22:11,426 --> 03:22:17,070
I just want the flexibility to be able to address the residents' concerns and not have to wait 60 or 90 days to get them here.

1974
03:22:19,597 --> 03:22:24,928
Once again, our preference is other, but certainly we respect the ultimate vote.

1975
03:22:25,328 --> 03:22:27,112
So I just want to make sure that we have this correct.

1976
03:22:27,813 --> 03:22:28,475
The front of the house.

1977
03:22:29,072 --> 03:22:32,075
will be able to operate from 6 to midnight, 6 to 12, correct?

1978
03:22:32,395 --> 03:22:32,615
Correct.

1979
03:22:33,175 --> 03:22:37,359
And the rear of the house for the deliveries will be 6 to 11.

1980
03:22:39,521 --> 03:22:46,467
The review would be on the back of the house would be in the 30 days, another review in 60 days, and a third review in 90 days.

1981
03:22:46,547 --> 03:22:48,548
And again, that's the review of the back of the house.

1982
03:22:48,568 --> 03:22:49,269
The back of the house.

1983
03:22:49,349 --> 03:22:49,869
That's correct.

1984
03:22:49,989 --> 03:22:51,130
Thanks for that clarification.

1985
03:22:51,190 --> 03:22:51,831
The back of the house.

1986
03:22:51,851 --> 03:22:53,072
Mr. President, if I can point out,

1987
03:22:54,333 --> 03:22:59,897
holding this special permit solely to the company of wetlands, not to the property.

1988
03:23:00,538 --> 03:23:00,978
That's correct.

1989
03:23:01,458 --> 03:23:11,245
And, like I said... And the trash, President Lago-Kern, regarding the trash... Maybe the term we should use is no loading or unloading.

1990
03:23:11,265 --> 03:23:13,407
Yeah, there'll be no trash pickup during those...

1991
03:23:16,534 --> 03:23:19,875
This would be 30 days from when the store opens, correct?

1992
03:23:20,035 --> 03:23:20,315
Correct.

1993
03:23:20,835 --> 03:23:31,579
Mr. President, also a review of any potential mitigation regarding the exhaust, which the gentleman already said that they would review the exhaust on top of the building.

1994
03:23:31,879 --> 03:23:41,041
And as far as guidelines tonight, I mean, we can start with specifications, show that it's a state-of-the-art, and we can provide that to the council through engineering.

1995
03:23:41,121 --> 03:23:42,382
What's your preference on that?

1996
03:23:44,462 --> 03:23:48,163
In particular, mitigation regarding noise mitigation.

1997
03:23:48,744 --> 03:23:49,444
That's what I'm saying.

1998
03:23:49,564 --> 03:23:51,384
I'm sure the unit is state of the art.

1999
03:23:51,404 --> 03:23:53,825
I'm sure it's up to code.

2000
03:23:53,925 --> 03:23:54,165
Correct.

2001
03:23:54,225 --> 03:23:57,286
And so the point is, what is triggering the mitigation?

2002
03:23:57,346 --> 03:23:58,866
Because what's the threshold?

2003
03:23:58,946 --> 03:23:59,847
I guess that's what I'm doing.

2004
03:23:59,867 --> 03:24:02,587
So we'll comply with ordinances of the city.

2005
03:24:03,348 --> 03:24:07,389
And I don't know if it's how specific it is, quite frankly, because we haven't been asked to review that.

2006
03:24:07,889 --> 03:24:09,269
But we'll take a look at that.

2007
03:24:09,469 --> 03:24:12,050
I would say the mitigation is regarding any additional steps

2008
03:24:13,269 --> 03:24:20,256
And our building department would be aware of this, like we did on Riverside Ave, which is right around the corner from your current establishment.

2009
03:24:21,037 --> 03:24:29,847
We had a few food establishments go in that had a similar, actually much smaller, exhaust, and they were able to put some type of barrier.

2010
03:24:30,627 --> 03:24:32,529
around the particular system.

2011
03:24:33,070 --> 03:24:40,797
The system was state-of-the-art, it was very efficient, but this barrier helped with alleviating some of the noise potential.

2012
03:24:41,197 --> 03:24:43,199
So I would ask that that be reviewed.

2013
03:24:43,219 --> 03:24:48,124
We certainly will review it, yes, and we'll present that to the Council through them, however you prefer.

2014
03:24:48,184 --> 03:24:48,584
Thank you.

2015
03:24:49,605 --> 03:24:55,230
Move approval on the motion by Councilor Dela Russo, seconded by

2016
03:24:57,537 --> 03:25:00,618
The motion will be the front of the House 6 to 12.

2017
03:25:02,819 --> 03:25:12,041
Back of the House 6 to 11 with a review of the 6090 days to be no rubbish pick up and there will be a review of also of the ventilation.

2018
03:25:12,061 --> 03:25:13,802
This is correct.

2019
03:25:13,842 --> 03:25:19,463
We have everything in the system should get to it and the president is restricted to wagons only.

2020
03:25:26,364 --> 03:25:28,707
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

2021
03:25:30,288 --> 03:25:31,209
Councilor DelaRusso?

2022
03:25:31,390 --> 03:25:31,610
Yes.

2023
03:25:32,391 --> 03:25:33,132
Councilor Falco?

2024
03:25:33,252 --> 03:25:33,452
Yes.

2025
03:25:34,433 --> 03:25:35,054
Councilor Knight?

2026
03:25:36,936 --> 03:25:37,777
Councilor Long and Kern?

2027
03:25:37,877 --> 03:25:38,077
Yes.

2028
03:25:39,078 --> 03:25:39,839
Vice President Mox?

2029
03:25:39,899 --> 03:25:40,200
Yes.

2030
03:25:40,840 --> 03:25:41,661
Councilor Scarpelli?

2031
03:25:41,681 --> 03:25:41,942
Yes.

2032
03:25:42,622 --> 03:25:43,343
President Calviano?

2033
03:25:43,563 --> 03:25:43,804
Yes.

2034
03:25:44,404 --> 03:25:46,687
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

2035
03:25:47,596 --> 03:25:48,557
Motion passes.

2036
03:25:48,997 --> 03:25:49,738
Thank you very much.

2037
03:25:49,838 --> 03:25:52,101
If I could make one request on doing developments.

2038
03:25:52,641 --> 03:25:54,663
We're holding Wegmans to this high standard.

2039
03:25:55,884 --> 03:26:07,216
I hope that you'll do the same with your other five stores that are coming in and make sure that they comply to the same standards that we're holding Wegmans to.

2040
03:26:07,236 --> 03:26:07,556
Thank you.

2041
03:26:07,796 --> 03:26:10,118
And if I might, in closing, number one and two,

2042
03:26:11,379 --> 03:26:31,150
One woman that talked about being, working for Wegmans, we were rated number seven in the, by Fortune, best workplaces for women, number two on the Fortune list of best 100 countries, 100 businesses, number two behind Google and ahead of the Boston Consulting Group.

2043
03:26:32,655 --> 03:26:35,616
and number one in supermarkets in the nation, so.

2044
03:26:36,076 --> 03:26:36,396
Thank you.

2045
03:26:37,276 --> 03:26:40,637
Motion by Councilor Scott Pelli to revert back to regular business.

2046
03:26:40,978 --> 03:26:41,158
Aye.

2047
03:26:41,638 --> 03:26:42,058
All in favor?

2048
03:26:42,198 --> 03:26:42,358
Aye.

2049
03:26:42,458 --> 03:26:42,798
Recess.

2050
03:26:43,638 --> 03:26:48,580
Councilor Scott Pelli has requested a five-minute recess.

2051
03:26:49,220 --> 03:26:52,181
Mr. President, can I move to have the record reflect that I vote in favor of that last paper, please?

2052
03:26:52,601 --> 03:26:59,263
Mr. Clerk, if you could move to reflect the record, show that Councilor Layton is in favor of this motion.

2053
03:27:01,441 --> 03:27:02,484
and we'll take a five minute recess.

2054
03:28:15,012 --> 03:28:15,252
th th

2055
03:28:55,820 --> 03:28:57,141
Thank you.

2056
03:29:34,423 --> 03:29:34,703
I will.

2057
03:29:34,803 --> 03:29:36,083
All right, thank you.

2058
03:30:13,084 --> 03:30:13,504
Okay.

2059
03:31:24,269 --> 03:31:24,629
Thank you.

2060
03:31:54,483 --> 03:31:55,264
Thank you.

2061
03:32:54,871 --> 03:32:56,043
Thank you so much.

2062
03:33:25,963 --> 03:33:26,504
I can't see it.

2063
03:33:26,524 --> 03:33:27,264
I can't see it.

2064
03:33:52,682 --> 03:33:53,463
No, actually I'm not.

2065
03:33:53,623 --> 03:33:56,186
I'm a second person.

2066
03:33:56,366 --> 03:33:58,828
Now, you wear a blue suit and you think, man, this is a real attorney.

2067
03:33:58,948 --> 03:33:59,269
I know.

2068
03:33:59,289 --> 03:33:59,789
First year.

2069
03:33:59,869 --> 03:34:00,330
It's all right.

2070
03:34:00,370 --> 03:34:00,930
It's all right.

2071
03:34:00,950 --> 03:34:01,811
First year or 100 year?

2072
03:34:01,891 --> 03:34:02,352
What's the difference?

2073
03:34:02,372 --> 03:34:03,193
Where do you go to school?

2074
03:34:03,293 --> 03:34:04,234
I went to Georgetown.

2075
03:34:04,574 --> 03:34:04,814
Oh, nice.

2076
03:34:04,834 --> 03:34:05,975
But I'm from the area, so.

2077
03:34:06,196 --> 03:34:07,737
Where are you from?

2078
03:34:07,777 --> 03:34:08,718
I'm from Lowell.

2079
03:34:08,898 --> 03:34:09,139
Lowell?

2080
03:34:09,179 --> 03:34:09,279
OK.

2081
03:34:09,479 --> 03:34:09,699
Yes.

2082
03:34:09,799 --> 03:34:10,920
I mean, I'm northwest.

2083
03:34:11,201 --> 03:34:11,761
Admiral Keith?

2084
03:34:13,490 --> 03:34:14,531
I suppose, I think we're friends.

2085
03:34:14,551 --> 03:34:15,631
No, that's not fair.

2086
03:34:15,671 --> 03:34:16,892
Do you go to the library?

2087
03:34:17,332 --> 03:34:17,873
No, I don't.

2088
03:34:17,973 --> 03:34:18,813
I used to work there.

2089
03:34:18,833 --> 03:34:19,433
Oh, really?

2090
03:34:19,613 --> 03:34:20,694
Are you from there?

2091
03:34:20,994 --> 03:34:22,435
No, I'm from Bethel, obviously.

2092
03:34:22,555 --> 03:34:25,096
But, no, I used to represent, yeah.

2093
03:34:25,116 --> 03:34:29,339
We used to run a treatment plant.

2094
03:34:29,559 --> 03:34:29,879
Okay.

2095
03:34:30,279 --> 03:34:35,842
And the school custodians, the library aides, the school clerks, the cafeteria workers.

2096
03:34:36,023 --> 03:34:37,143
Do you think it has been?

2097
03:34:37,163 --> 03:34:37,703
No, it hasn't.

2098
03:34:41,277 --> 03:34:41,497
Yeah.

2099
03:34:59,690 --> 03:35:03,731
Patrick Javis was the Cambridge Region Latin basketball coach.

2100
03:35:04,012 --> 03:35:05,072
Patrick Ewing, you know what I mean?

2101
03:35:05,132 --> 03:35:06,733
And he ended up down there in Georgetown.

2102
03:35:06,913 --> 03:35:07,873
I chose Washington, rather.

2103
03:35:07,933 --> 03:35:10,474
My father and Mike played together in college at Northeastern.

2104
03:35:10,514 --> 03:35:11,274
They played against each other.

2105
03:35:11,314 --> 03:35:12,414
My father played at Summerline.

2106
03:35:12,475 --> 03:35:13,515
Mike played at Cambridgeside.

2107
03:35:14,055 --> 03:35:15,516
And then my father was a coach.

2108
03:35:15,736 --> 03:35:17,456
My father played at Northeastern.

2109
03:35:17,516 --> 03:35:18,837
And Javis played at Northeastern.

2110
03:35:18,877 --> 03:35:20,537
Well, they played together in college.

2111
03:35:20,837 --> 03:35:21,718
And my father graduated.

2112
03:35:21,738 --> 03:35:22,238
He graduated.

2113
03:35:22,278 --> 03:35:23,238
He went to Cambridge Region Latin.

2114
03:35:23,258 --> 03:35:24,179
My father went to Summerline.

2115
03:35:24,479 --> 03:35:25,399
He coached Patrick Ewing.

2116
03:35:25,799 --> 03:35:26,719
And he got the college job.

2117
03:35:32,284 --> 03:35:32,845
You must go on.

2118
03:35:32,865 --> 03:35:35,430
Phil Ronan, you know Phil Ronan?

2119
03:35:35,450 --> 03:35:36,672
His father was the principal of this school.

2120
03:35:56,552 --> 03:35:56,972
Yeah.

2121
03:35:56,992 --> 03:35:57,113
Yeah.

2122
03:36:30,724 --> 03:36:47,496
Mr. President, motion to return back to regular business.

2123
03:36:47,696 --> 03:36:53,680
Motion for suspension of the rules to take committee report of the side committee, Mr. President.

2124
03:36:54,953 --> 03:36:57,675
Motion by Councilor De La Russa to take 17651.

2125
03:36:57,715 --> 03:36:57,675
17651.

2126
03:37:00,197 --> 03:37:07,341
Subcommittee on Business and Economic Development.

2127
03:37:07,361 --> 03:37:11,364
I ask that Chairman Marks give a discourse on this matter.

2128
03:37:13,545 --> 03:37:15,386
Who is giving a discourse on this matter?

2129
03:37:15,426 --> 03:37:16,127
Chairman Marks.

2130
03:37:17,352 --> 03:37:23,574
Mr. Vice President, would you like to report on your Subcommittee on Business, Economic, Development, and Science meeting of September 6, 2017?

2131
03:37:24,214 --> 03:37:27,355
Yes, thank you, Mr. President.

2132
03:37:27,375 --> 03:37:31,556
The Subcommittee on Business, Economic, Development, and Science met September 6.

2133
03:37:32,516 --> 03:37:44,419
Attendees at the meeting was myself, Counselor Scott Pelley, Paul Mulkey, the Billing Commissioner, John Bevuso, Code Enforcement, Pastor Ferrier,

2134
03:37:46,887 --> 03:37:48,168
who's out in the audience.

2135
03:37:50,790 --> 03:38:01,656
Former President Robert Mayocko was president, and George, Rick Sackle was also president at the meeting, Mr. President.

2136
03:38:02,497 --> 03:38:11,163
The request that we had was for a sign, a denial for the invention, invention, invention,

2137
03:38:12,223 --> 03:38:14,904
Haitian Church 400 High Street.

2138
03:38:15,924 --> 03:38:18,044
The sign exceeded allowable size.

2139
03:38:18,945 --> 03:38:31,087
We met in subcommittee to discuss the request of illumination, which we recommend to this full council that the sign be turned off by 11 p.m.

2140
03:38:31,968 --> 03:38:36,129
Also the request for a message board on the sign.

2141
03:38:37,429 --> 03:38:41,350
We requested that it only be used for church

2142
03:38:42,230 --> 03:38:47,052
and educational notices, which we presented to the full council tonight.

2143
03:38:47,732 --> 03:38:57,856
And the frequency of the changing of the sign, which this council has debated over years, and the standard pretty much is four times per hour.

2144
03:38:58,336 --> 03:39:03,277
So we allow a 15-minute frequency of change for the signage.

2145
03:39:04,078 --> 03:39:10,380
And we ask that this paper be reported out favorably to the full council, Mr. President.

2146
03:39:11,197 --> 03:39:11,918
Councilor Scarpelli.

2147
03:39:12,138 --> 03:39:14,220
With the focus on just church business.

2148
03:39:15,841 --> 03:39:18,224
Church and educational notice and church business.

2149
03:39:18,284 --> 03:39:18,984
Thank you.

2150
03:39:21,046 --> 03:39:27,893
On the motion by President Box that this paper be re- You have a deadline?

2151
03:39:28,977 --> 03:39:31,077
You want to take up the other one?

2152
03:39:31,377 --> 03:39:34,558
Yes, 17-573 for global health care services, Mr. President.

2153
03:39:36,258 --> 03:39:40,859
This particular petitioner did not show up at the meeting, Mr. President.

2154
03:39:41,399 --> 03:39:47,941
And at the time, there was a motion during a subcommittee meeting that it would be received and placed on file.

2155
03:39:48,641 --> 03:39:50,121
So that would be the motion for paper 17-573.

2156
03:39:50,241 --> 03:39:51,701
Motion that the committee report

2157
03:39:57,060 --> 03:40:02,221
On the motion by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Marks, that the paper be adopted.

2158
03:40:04,041 --> 03:40:04,121
Aye.

2159
03:40:06,282 --> 03:40:07,702
All right.

2160
03:40:08,002 --> 03:40:08,742
Let's get back to 17.

2161
03:40:08,802 --> 03:40:14,483
Mr. President, we're under suspension.

2162
03:40:14,503 --> 03:40:17,784
Can we take paper 17-606 off the table?

2163
03:40:17,804 --> 03:40:20,644
17-606.

2164
03:40:20,884 --> 03:40:25,065
The recommendation for the sign for the Evangelical Occasion Church at 400 High Street.

2165
03:40:27,002 --> 03:40:30,423
Motion by Councilor Knight to take paper 17-606 off the table.

2166
03:40:30,504 --> 03:40:33,865
Moved and seconded by Councilor Dela Russo.

2167
03:40:33,945 --> 03:40:34,525
All in favor?

2168
03:40:35,145 --> 03:40:38,046
Aye.

2169
03:40:38,086 --> 03:40:42,568
Mr. President, I think Councilor Marks gave an excellent synopsis of what occurred at the subcommittee meeting.

2170
03:40:42,628 --> 03:40:45,169
I thank him and the other members of the subcommittee for their work.

2171
03:40:46,129 --> 03:40:50,931
Personally, I think this is a good way to make some concessions to a situation that had some concerns.

2172
03:40:51,919 --> 03:40:59,588
I'd just like to add that the permit expired with the petitioner, if my council colleagues would indulge me.

2173
03:40:59,908 --> 03:41:04,113
And also, we put a 90-day review on it, and I'd have no problem supporting this this evening, Mr. President.

2174
03:41:04,293 --> 03:41:11,802
I don't think I'd have a problem supporting it either way, but I have gotten some feedback from some abutters and residents in the neighborhood that did have some concern about the illumination and would like to see a review.

2175
03:41:14,480 --> 03:41:20,187
On the motion by Councillor Neill, seconded by Councillor— Mr. President, if I could.

2176
03:41:20,247 --> 03:41:20,948
Mr. Vice President.

2177
03:41:22,089 --> 03:41:26,875
I think those are excellent recommendations made by Councillor Neill.

2178
03:41:26,915 --> 03:41:31,841
The 90-day review, I think, is appropriate where this sign is illuminated.

2179
03:41:33,646 --> 03:41:47,911
I just want people in the viewing audience to realize there at one point there was two signs in front of the church, one off to the right and the main sign which we're dealing with, which is off to the left.

2180
03:41:48,791 --> 03:41:54,913
And that sign actually faces perpendicular to High Street.

2181
03:41:55,393 --> 03:41:57,414
So it doesn't face High Street.

2182
03:41:58,914 --> 03:42:00,815
And I just want people to realize that.

2183
03:42:01,277 --> 03:42:08,641
But I think that's an excellent recommendation with the permit to expire with this petitioner and the 90-day review.

2184
03:42:09,162 --> 03:42:10,342
I would support that, Mr. President.

2185
03:42:11,483 --> 03:42:13,164
Move approval as amended, Mr. President.

2186
03:42:13,684 --> 03:42:19,308
So, on the motion by Councilor Layton to move the committee report as amended.

2187
03:42:21,328 --> 03:42:22,470
No, the committee report's been adopted.

2188
03:42:22,490 --> 03:42:23,893
I want to move the paper out favorably.

2189
03:42:23,913 --> 03:42:29,903
17-606, approval for a special permit for the signed variance with both following criteria of the contingencies.

2190
03:42:30,183 --> 03:42:34,992
The AB&C that was established at the subcommittee, a 90-day review on the permit with the petitioner.

2191
03:42:36,926 --> 03:42:41,089
17606 is not on the table yet, Councillor.

2192
03:42:41,649 --> 03:42:43,090
We just adopted the committee report.

2193
03:42:43,130 --> 03:42:43,991
He asked to take it off.

2194
03:42:44,271 --> 03:42:51,416
We adopted the committee report and we took the paper up for the pastor and then we adopted the paper with those five restrictions.

2195
03:42:52,757 --> 03:42:54,558
Unfinished business, right?

2196
03:42:59,587 --> 03:43:01,489
Well, the committee report came out.

2197
03:43:02,069 --> 03:43:05,292
If I may, point of parliamentary procedure, Mr. President.

2198
03:43:06,033 --> 03:43:07,634
The committee report was reported out favorably.

2199
03:43:07,674 --> 03:43:08,134
That's paper 17651.

2200
03:43:08,175 --> 03:43:08,275
Right.

2201
03:43:08,535 --> 03:43:09,696
Paper 17651 contained two papers, 17606 and 17573.

2202
03:43:09,996 --> 03:43:11,377
The petition 17606 is the Evangelical Church.

2203
03:43:11,397 --> 03:43:13,459
But its entirety is the committee report.

2204
03:43:13,479 --> 03:43:13,539
Yes.

2205
03:43:13,559 --> 03:43:14,540
Which, regarding those provisions,

2206
03:43:26,110 --> 03:43:30,814
What you're doing is you're actually amending the committee report for 90 day review.

2207
03:43:30,954 --> 03:43:32,335
That's what you're doing.

2208
03:43:32,355 --> 03:43:35,338
90 day review and elimination.

2209
03:43:35,478 --> 03:43:36,078
Good point.

2210
03:43:36,098 --> 03:43:36,659
Good point.

2211
03:43:38,340 --> 03:43:41,283
On the motion by Councilor Knight as amended.

2212
03:43:41,723 --> 03:43:42,564
Roll call vote Mr. President.

2213
03:43:42,644 --> 03:43:45,767
Roll call vote has been requested by Vice President Mox.

2214
03:43:51,291 --> 03:43:52,152
Councilor Dela Russo.

2215
03:43:52,432 --> 03:43:52,532
Aye.

2216
03:43:53,393 --> 03:43:54,154
Councilor Falcone.

2217
03:43:54,294 --> 03:43:54,454
Yes.

2218
03:43:55,180 --> 03:43:55,460
Yes.

2219
03:43:55,521 --> 03:43:55,621
Yes.

2220
03:43:55,681 --> 03:43:55,961
Yes.

2221
03:43:55,981 --> 03:43:56,021
No.

2222
03:43:56,042 --> 03:43:57,364
Six of the affirmative.

2223
03:43:57,384 --> 03:43:59,347
One of the negative motion passes.

2224
03:44:08,957 --> 03:44:13,598
Motion to revert back to regular business.

2225
03:44:13,618 --> 03:44:25,201
17-634, offered by President Caravaglia and Councilor Layne, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council send its sincere condolences to the family of William Bill Quigley on his recent passing.

2226
03:44:25,261 --> 03:44:30,162
Bill was a lifelong Memphis resident and Navy veteran who served his country in World War II.

2227
03:44:30,622 --> 03:44:33,603
His presence in our community will be sorely missed.

2228
03:44:35,303 --> 03:44:38,850
I personally have known the Quigley family and Bill for many, many years.

2229
03:44:38,870 --> 03:44:41,415
He passed very quickly.

2230
03:44:44,465 --> 03:44:46,327
Good man, good family man, he will be missed.

2231
03:44:46,727 --> 03:44:47,848
Councillor Knight.

2232
03:44:47,908 --> 03:44:52,273
Mr. President, thank you very much and I'd just like to take a moment to offer my condolences to the Quigley family.

2233
03:44:52,913 --> 03:44:59,760
Bill was a great guy, you'd always see him down at Puppers wearing his hat and showing that he was a United States veteran proudly.

2234
03:45:00,141 --> 03:45:05,466
He and his sons would always go down for dinner, his grandson Michael and I were very good friends in high school, played lacrosse together.

2235
03:45:05,946 --> 03:45:07,106
It's very sad to see him go.

2236
03:45:07,146 --> 03:45:11,528
He was a good man, a good friend, and he's going to be sorely missed in this community because he was somebody that gave back.

2237
03:45:12,148 --> 03:45:14,648
So with that being said, Mr. President, I move for approval on the paper.

2238
03:45:14,668 --> 03:45:18,429
I ask my council colleagues to join us in offering our condolences to the Quigley family.

2239
03:45:41,250 --> 03:45:58,281
17-636, offered by President Caravaglia, be it resolved that the Medford City Council request that the tree warden, Aggie Tudin, attend the next city council meeting to explain the fungus that has affected hundreds of trees in Medford and offer a solution to what can be done to prevent this from happening again.

2240
03:45:58,301 --> 03:45:59,121
I know Ms.

2241
03:45:59,141 --> 03:46:07,246
Tudin was here earlier, but the meeting went on and she did have some explanations and she will be happy to come next week to offer

2242
03:46:10,125 --> 03:46:15,327
and explain what has happened to the trees and what can be done to hopefully stop this from happening again.

2243
03:46:15,347 --> 03:46:20,129
Motion by Councilor Dela Russo, seconded by Councilor— To table?

2244
03:46:20,409 --> 03:46:21,630
She'll be coming next week to speak.

2245
03:46:22,070 --> 03:46:23,930
So you're going to leave this on this table?

2246
03:46:24,371 --> 03:46:25,331
Yes.

2247
03:46:25,351 --> 03:46:26,291
The resolution is to ask her to come?

2248
03:46:26,311 --> 03:46:27,812
The resolution is to ask her to come next week.

2249
03:46:27,852 --> 03:46:28,832
Oh, perfect.

2250
03:46:28,892 --> 03:46:30,193
Seconded by Councilor McCurran.

2251
03:46:30,293 --> 03:46:30,953
All those in favor?

2252
03:46:32,053 --> 03:46:32,153
Aye.

2253
03:46:32,533 --> 03:46:33,354
Motion passes.

2254
03:46:34,463 --> 03:46:46,071
17-637, I'll invite Vice President Mox and Councilor Lockern to be resolved that the administration provide an update to the Memphis City Council with regards to the Hegner Center and what current and the future plans are.

2255
03:46:46,491 --> 03:46:47,232
Vice President Mox.

2256
03:46:48,252 --> 03:46:49,533
I'll yield to my colleague.

2257
03:46:49,573 --> 03:46:50,394
Councilor Lockern.

2258
03:46:51,194 --> 03:46:51,755
I'll be brief.

2259
03:46:51,815 --> 03:46:53,356
Thank you, President Carviello.

2260
03:46:53,936 --> 03:47:03,503
I believe the last time Councilor Mox and I brought this up at the request of a number of residents that live in the area and just inquiring what's going on with the Hegner Center,

2261
03:47:03,967 --> 03:47:04,688
was in June.

2262
03:47:05,388 --> 03:47:07,710
We asked just for an update from the administration.

2263
03:47:07,730 --> 03:47:11,492
I don't believe we got a detailed update that we were expecting.

2264
03:47:12,013 --> 03:47:18,817
I know that I did reach out to the chief of police at the time, and there was allowable use by the police department in that area.

2265
03:47:18,837 --> 03:47:20,458
I think it was some dog training going on.

2266
03:47:20,899 --> 03:47:28,104
And it almost seemed like that was going to be just temporary until a plan is put in place for the Hagner Center.

2267
03:47:28,524 --> 03:47:29,845
The city did acquire it.

2268
03:47:29,865 --> 03:47:32,927
And we as a council just want to know

2269
03:47:33,417 --> 03:47:34,258
What is the plan?

2270
03:47:35,058 --> 03:47:40,983
It's been mentioned that to have it as a possible art center, multiple uses for the city.

2271
03:47:41,003 --> 03:47:42,504
Are we going to redevelop it?

2272
03:47:42,524 --> 03:47:44,205
Can we afford to redevelop it?

2273
03:47:44,246 --> 03:47:45,627
But are we going to redevelop it?

2274
03:47:45,887 --> 03:47:46,367
What is the plan?

2275
03:47:47,848 --> 03:47:51,129
Simple question, can we just get an update on the Heckner Center?

2276
03:47:51,449 --> 03:47:52,990
There are neighbors that live in the area.

2277
03:47:53,190 --> 03:47:57,772
I know it has been cleaned up by the DPW, so the neighbors are very thankful for that.

2278
03:47:58,272 --> 03:48:01,933
But an ultimate plan, what is our yearly plan for this?

2279
03:48:01,953 --> 03:48:03,013
What is the five-year goal?

2280
03:48:03,073 --> 03:48:05,214
Do we have goals for this Heckner Center?

2281
03:48:05,854 --> 03:48:07,395
Is it included in the capital plan?

2282
03:48:07,415 --> 03:48:11,836
A number of questions that just need to be answered for us and for the residents.

2283
03:48:12,197 --> 03:48:12,557
Thank you.

2284
03:48:12,577 --> 03:48:12,897
Thank you.

2285
03:48:13,377 --> 03:48:14,118
Vice President Mox.

2286
03:48:14,718 --> 03:48:15,459
Thank you, Mr. President.

2287
03:48:15,499 --> 03:48:19,602
I want to thank Councilor Lungo Kern for co-sponsoring this resolution.

2288
03:48:20,342 --> 03:48:28,468
As the Councilor mentioned, there's been a lot of activity over the last several months there, and residents in the area are concerned what's going on.

2289
03:48:29,209 --> 03:48:35,554
And naturally, with the track record we have as a community on upkeeping our facilities,

2290
03:48:36,374 --> 03:48:40,178
they're concerned that this building not fall into disarray.

2291
03:48:40,698 --> 03:48:43,781
So that is why we offer this tonight, Mr. President.

2292
03:48:44,161 --> 03:48:46,363
We have a number of needs in this community.

2293
03:48:47,124 --> 03:48:55,271
Councilor Scott Peli will tell you with the new addition of a recreation department, this may be a great location for Method Recreation.

2294
03:48:56,011 --> 03:48:59,755
We currently don't have a home for Method Arts or Method Art Council.

2295
03:49:00,215 --> 03:49:02,297
That would be a great location, Mr. President.

2296
03:49:02,877 --> 03:49:18,224
in that area, and I would ask, Mr. President, that it was only roughly about a year, year and a half ago when the city administration sent a paper to this council requesting that we sell off the building.

2297
03:49:19,184 --> 03:49:21,805
And it was this council that stood up and said, wait a minute.

2298
03:49:22,486 --> 03:49:24,787
First of all, we leased this building out for $1.

2299
03:49:26,245 --> 03:49:37,071
And the stipulation was, if it was no longer gonna be used for the intended purpose, which was to assist people with disability, that it would revert back to the city.

2300
03:49:37,551 --> 03:49:49,598
So it was this council that halted the process, and thanks to City Solicitor Mark Rumley, we were able to get control back of the building, which in my opinion, was a step in the right direction.

2301
03:49:49,998 --> 03:49:52,039
Now we have to figure out what we're gonna do with the building.

2302
03:49:52,500 --> 03:49:54,821
So I support this resolution wholeheartedly,

2303
03:49:55,261 --> 03:49:56,562
and hope we can get an answer on this.

2304
03:50:20,517 --> 03:50:20,757
Yes.

2305
03:50:21,218 --> 03:50:21,378
Yes.

2306
03:50:21,398 --> 03:50:21,518
Yes.

2307
03:50:21,598 --> 03:50:21,738
Yes.

2308
03:50:21,818 --> 03:50:22,118
Yes.

2309
03:50:22,158 --> 03:50:22,318
Yes.

2310
03:50:22,358 --> 03:50:22,778
Yes.

2311
03:50:22,838 --> 03:50:23,019
Yes.

2312
03:50:23,039 --> 03:50:23,179
Yes.

2313
03:50:23,239 --> 03:50:23,319
Yes.

2314
03:50:23,339 --> 03:50:23,559
Yes.

2315
03:50:24,239 --> 03:50:24,339
Yes.

2316
03:50:24,359 --> 03:50:24,439
Yes.

2317
03:50:24,459 --> 03:50:24,539
Yes.

2318
03:50:24,579 --> 03:50:24,659
Yes.

2319
03:50:24,719 --> 03:50:24,960
Yes.

2320
03:50:25,100 --> 03:50:25,400
Yes.

2321
03:50:25,420 --> 03:50:25,480
Yes.

2322
03:50:25,800 --> 03:50:25,940
Yes.

2323
03:50:25,960 --> 03:50:26,060
Yes.

2324
03:50:26,100 --> 03:50:26,240
Yes.

2325
03:50:26,260 --> 03:50:26,440
Yes.

2326
03:50:26,460 --> 03:50:26,560
Yes.

2327
03:50:26,640 --> 03:50:26,901
Yes.

2328
03:50:26,921 --> 03:50:27,721
Yes.

2329
03:50:27,741 --> 03:50:27,821
Yes.

2330
03:50:27,841 --> 03:50:28,041
Yes.

2331
03:50:28,061 --> 03:50:28,261
Yes.

2332
03:50:28,582 --> 03:50:28,782
Yes.

2333
03:50:49,008 --> 03:51:05,350
of the historic district commission, whereas pursuant to city of Medford code of ordinances 48-546, the historic commission shall propose from time to time as the mayor deems appropriate the creation of additional historic districts

2334
03:51:05,742 --> 03:51:08,363
or changes to the existing historic districts.

2335
03:51:08,743 --> 03:51:23,208
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council request that the Memphis Historic District Commission examine the recommendations outlined in the Memphis Square Draft Master Plan and provide the council and the administration with an analysis on implementation.

2336
03:51:23,328 --> 03:51:24,008
Councilor Knight.

2337
03:51:24,449 --> 03:51:27,790
Mr. President, this is a rather self-explanatory resolution.

2338
03:51:28,710 --> 03:51:31,731
Ultimately, we spend lots and lots of money in this community on plans.

2339
03:51:32,411 --> 03:51:34,152
And we get plans and reports back,

2340
03:51:35,006 --> 03:51:37,729
One thing that I think we're not so strong at is implementation.

2341
03:51:38,309 --> 03:51:43,033
And this right here, Mr. President, is a measure that was outlined in the Medford Square Draft Master Plan.

2342
03:51:44,034 --> 03:51:48,158
And it calls for the establishment of Medford Square Historic District.

2343
03:51:48,738 --> 03:51:55,044
And I think that this is going to be a catalyst, Mr. President, in generating some interest in foot traffic down through Medford Square.

2344
03:51:55,084 --> 03:51:58,647
I think it's going to be something that's going to help us revitalize that

2345
03:52:01,065 --> 03:52:05,267
I don't want to say blighted business district, but business district in need of some resuscitation.

2346
03:52:06,028 --> 03:52:22,497
So with that being said, Mr. President, I'm asking my council colleagues to support the resolution asking for the Medford Historic District Commission to exercise their power established under the general laws and by city ordinance to provide the mayor with an analysis on the implementation thereof so that it can come to the council and then we can move forward on the matter.

2347
03:52:23,437 --> 03:52:44,991
In looking at this, Mr. President, and thinking about the situation in Medford Square and the status of the certain requests that come before this council, I also want to put forth a B paper asking that the Medford City Council place a moratorium on signed variances in the proposed Medford Square Historic District until the analysis is completed by the Medford Historic District Commission.

2348
03:52:45,311 --> 03:52:49,754
So with that being said, Mr. President, I'd ask my colleagues to support the A paper and the B paper moving forward.

2349
03:52:58,365 --> 03:52:59,665
If I may.

2350
03:52:59,705 --> 03:53:00,966
Thank you, President Carvio.

2351
03:53:01,026 --> 03:53:05,327
I think on the main motion, I think this is definitely a great resolve by Councilor Knight.

2352
03:53:05,347 --> 03:53:13,369
I think it's important that we get input from the Historic District Commission on which areas they believe should be designated historic.

2353
03:53:13,829 --> 03:53:21,811
I'm hoping that there's not obviously many changes and definitely not eliminations to any of our current historic districts.

2354
03:53:22,031 --> 03:53:27,872
And I don't think that's the premise of the resolution, although I did get a concerned citizen calling me about that.

2355
03:53:28,532 --> 03:53:29,914
Otherwise, I think it's a good resolve.

2356
03:53:30,094 --> 03:53:33,537
I think a moratorium is something that probably just needs a little bit more discussion.

2357
03:53:33,898 --> 03:53:42,447
It's a late hour, and I just would like to lay that B paper laid on the table for a week so we can wrap our minds around it.

2358
03:53:44,354 --> 03:54:04,548
And if I may, Mr. President, the reason that I bring the B paper forward is because if we're going to take a serious look at preserving the historic character of Memphis Square and the sub squares that have been identified in the master plan, then I think one thing that we need to do is make sure that we have some continuity and some compliance with our locally established ordinance.

2359
03:54:04,568 --> 03:54:05,849
We've been giving a lot of variances.

2360
03:54:06,169 --> 03:54:07,690
The Property 5 High Street comes to mind.

2361
03:54:08,350 --> 03:54:10,952
We've had how many requests for sign variances at that one property?

2362
03:54:10,992 --> 03:54:13,034
That's one of the keystone buildings in our square.

2363
03:54:13,494 --> 03:54:26,085
And the more times we issue permits for non-conforming use of signs, the less and less character we have down there, the less and less historic feel that we have down there, Mr. President.

2364
03:54:26,105 --> 03:54:28,267
So I think that it is time to take a look at that.

2365
03:54:28,307 --> 03:54:32,170
I certainly have no problem with Councilor Longo's recommendation that we deal with it at a later time.

2366
03:54:32,650 --> 03:54:34,211
However, it's something that I think is very important.

2367
03:54:34,271 --> 03:54:36,691
I think it's very important to the revitalization of our square.

2368
03:54:36,711 --> 03:54:39,772
I think it's very important to the aesthetic feel of our square.

2369
03:54:39,832 --> 03:54:49,516
And I think it's very important to us preserving our historic landmarks in the square and those items that people recognize from afar and have recognized from afar for many a year.

2370
03:54:50,096 --> 03:54:53,057
So with that being said, Mr. President, I withdraw the B paper.

2371
03:54:53,097 --> 03:54:54,937
I'll reintroduce that paper at a later date.

2372
03:54:54,957 --> 03:54:56,438
And I ask the move for approval on the A paper.

2373
03:54:57,078 --> 03:54:59,619
On the motion by Councilor Knight, seconded by

2374
03:55:00,652 --> 03:55:01,633
Councilor Dela Cruz.

2375
03:55:01,653 --> 03:55:02,633
Councilor DeFalco.

2376
03:55:03,454 --> 03:55:04,214
All those in favor?

2377
03:55:04,374 --> 03:55:04,794
Aye.

2378
03:55:05,095 --> 03:55:07,476
Motion passes.

2379
03:55:07,496 --> 03:55:09,617
17-640 offered by Councilor Longo-Kern.

2380
03:55:10,098 --> 03:55:16,121
Be it resolved that the Memphis City Council be updated with regards to the status of hiring of a traffic engineer.

2381
03:55:16,221 --> 03:55:17,262
Councilor Longo-Kern.

2382
03:55:17,682 --> 03:55:19,083
Thank you, President Carviello.

2383
03:55:19,303 --> 03:55:27,288
I'm not sure if my colleagues have any answers with regards to the traffic engineer, but it's something we did approve back in June with the fiscal

2384
03:55:28,888 --> 03:55:32,529
18 budget, and it's something that is desperately needed.

2385
03:55:32,629 --> 03:55:35,349
So I'm wondering if the hiring process has started.

2386
03:55:35,369 --> 03:55:36,129
Well, if I can.

2387
03:55:36,389 --> 03:55:37,950
Councilor Scarpelli.

2388
03:55:37,970 --> 03:55:56,833
The only reason why I can speak somewhat to this, my fellow council, that both the recreation and the assistant recreation director's position has been posted with the traffic engineer's position has been posted, and they're now accepting resumes

2389
03:55:57,533 --> 03:55:59,995
for all three positions, which is very exciting.

2390
03:56:00,715 --> 03:56:03,757
Mr. President, just just finish.

2391
03:56:03,797 --> 03:56:05,338
No, I think that that's great news.

2392
03:56:06,439 --> 03:56:07,259
I'm glad to hear it.

2393
03:56:07,299 --> 03:56:16,946
And I think it's extremely important, especially with the new plans or potential plans for Method Square, Mystic Ave and a number of other locations within the city.

2394
03:56:16,966 --> 03:56:21,929
And we need traffic engineer for the entire city complaints all the time about traffic.

2395
03:56:22,009 --> 03:56:23,570
And definitely it's a needed position.

2396
03:56:23,630 --> 03:56:25,771
So it's good to hear that it has been posted.

2397
03:56:26,412 --> 03:56:26,912
Mr. President,

2398
03:56:28,890 --> 03:56:30,472
Thank you, Mr. President.

2399
03:56:31,232 --> 03:56:33,734
As everyone knows, this is an issue that's near and dear to my heart.

2400
03:56:33,835 --> 03:56:41,421
I've sponsored a number of resolutions regarding a traffic engineer that was supported by this board unanimously and I'm happy that it's been included in the budget.

2401
03:56:41,882 --> 03:56:46,806
And I've been on top of this with regard to, I really want to see this happen.

2402
03:56:46,826 --> 03:56:51,831
And in the police community meetings that we have monthly, traffic always comes up.

2403
03:56:56,133 --> 03:56:58,495
we have a meeting in, traffic is always the number one issue.

2404
03:56:59,355 --> 03:57:02,997
So I've been in contact with the Chief of Staff on a regular basis just to get updates.

2405
03:57:03,557 --> 03:57:14,743
And what I can tell you is, just to give you a little bit more specifics, is that it's been posted on the Mass Municipal Association website, as well as the City of Medford website.

2406
03:57:14,763 --> 03:57:20,566
They've gone out to different colleges, WPI, University of Lowell, UMass Boston, Bentley.

2407
03:57:20,906 --> 03:57:22,567
So it's on numerous college websites.

2408
03:57:23,207 --> 03:57:38,218
websites and boards and they've also gone out to three engineering associations as well to post a position and they are currently screening resumes and people can still apply but it's definitely something that I know that they're working on.

2409
03:57:38,238 --> 03:57:48,545
Like I said, this is near and dear to my heart and I know I've been curious about it as well and that's just to give you an update with regard to where they are with regard to the hiring process.

2410
03:57:48,585 --> 03:57:49,686
Thank you.

2411
03:57:49,706 --> 03:57:50,026
Thank you.

2412
03:57:52,233 --> 03:57:53,554
On the motion by Councilor Kerr.

2413
03:57:56,236 --> 03:57:57,777
Seconded by Councilor Mox.

2414
03:57:57,937 --> 03:57:58,537
All those in favor?

2415
03:57:58,938 --> 03:57:59,038
Aye.

2416
03:57:59,518 --> 03:58:01,459
Motion is approved.

2417
03:58:01,479 --> 03:58:13,047
17-641 offered by Vice President Mox be it resolved that a citywide reverse 911 call be made alerting residents where to find contact info regarding airplane noise.

2418
03:58:13,487 --> 03:58:19,871
Additionally, that the city create boilerplate noise complaint letters on the city website for residents to use.

2419
03:58:19,911 --> 03:58:20,812
Vice President Mox.

2420
03:58:21,660 --> 03:58:22,641
Thank you, Mr. President.

2421
03:58:22,661 --> 03:58:29,929
I had the opportunity to attend the September 11th meeting at the South Memphis Fire Station.

2422
03:58:30,830 --> 03:58:43,643
And I just want to put out a special thank you to Luke Presner and Peter Hulk, who are the appointees to the MCAC, which is Mass Point Community Advisory Committee.

2423
03:58:44,243 --> 03:59:00,663
and they've done yeoman's work over the last several months in organizing and also having a seat at the table when decisions are being made at Massport to make sure that method is well represented and I can say unequivocally that is currently happening

2424
03:59:01,103 --> 03:59:03,384
which didn't happen for a number of years.

2425
03:59:04,144 --> 03:59:05,985
But it was well attended.

2426
03:59:06,025 --> 03:59:10,427
There probably was 80 to 100 people stuffed into that small room.

2427
03:59:11,208 --> 03:59:17,170
And there was a number of issues discussed, a number of concerns raised by residents.

2428
03:59:17,790 --> 03:59:20,992
And two particular ones that I raised tonight, Mr. President, is

2429
03:59:21,692 --> 03:59:38,360
that unless you've been following the issue, most residents that are experiencing this particular noise from airplanes on a consistent basis, early and both late in the evening, are unaware where to file complaints.

2430
03:59:38,840 --> 03:59:40,581
They're unaware what the next step is.

2431
03:59:41,201 --> 03:59:58,426
And I would ask that the city take its reverse 911 option and alert the 58,000 residents of Method where they can get this information and how to go about filing a complaint with Massport regarding the noise, Mr. President.

2432
03:59:59,018 --> 04:00:14,189
Also, it was recommended that let us be written to our congressional delegation and also to Massport regarding the noise and some of the other communities like Milton and other communities that have been very successful.

2433
04:00:14,870 --> 04:00:33,598
in kind of altering the air traffic over their communities have created these boilerplate letters that rather than having a citizen sit down and try to craft their own letter, they can go online and just pick out a letter, Mr. President, and send it to the congressional delegation or the Mass Board.

2434
04:00:33,918 --> 04:00:42,122
So I would ask that our city put on our website right now some boilerplate letters on behalf of the residents of this community.

2435
04:00:42,822 --> 04:00:56,166
There is currently, what we heard that night, MIT is currently doing a study that the city of Method will be able to use as an impact study on the air traffic over our community.

2436
04:00:56,946 --> 04:00:59,247
And I found it very interesting that

2437
04:01:00,687 --> 04:01:12,775
Some of the modifications that could be made to decrease the noise of our community is to have flight patents go out over the water rather than over the major communities.

2438
04:01:13,476 --> 04:01:22,822
And from what we heard from Peter and Luke is that sometimes these are decisions that are made by the actual pilot and not Logan.

2439
04:01:23,122 --> 04:01:28,266
Logan may recommend they go some way, but it's only a recommendation and maybe if we

2440
04:01:28,986 --> 04:01:40,089
The teeth in these patents, flight patents, will be able to divert some of this traffic out over the ocean where there will be less of an impact on our community.

2441
04:01:40,709 --> 04:01:52,072
Also, Mr. President, because East Boston and Winthrop and Revere have such an impact, when planes take off from Logan Airport, they're going at a much slower rate of speed.

2442
04:01:52,812 --> 04:01:58,933
And that lessens the impact of noise to East Boston, Winthrop, Revere.

2443
04:01:59,433 --> 04:02:06,675
However, once they take off at that slower rate of speed, to reach the altitude they need, they have to start picking up speed.

2444
04:02:07,075 --> 04:02:09,015
And that's when they're coming over the city of Method.

2445
04:02:09,376 --> 04:02:16,217
And that's when we're hearing the rumbling that these large jets are trying to pick up altitude.

2446
04:02:16,917 --> 04:02:25,225
And if they were able to take off a little quicker at Logan Airport, we may be able to alleviate some of the noise that we're considering.

2447
04:02:25,885 --> 04:02:29,528
However, that'll be more of an impact on East Boston and Winthrop and Revere.

2448
04:02:30,549 --> 04:02:40,979
So the MIT study is taking all this into consideration, flap deployment, modified acceleration, and a number of other issues, Mr. President.

2449
04:02:42,079 --> 04:02:45,501
It's fair to say that this is not an issue that's going to go away.

2450
04:02:45,922 --> 04:02:48,403
It's an issue of grave concern in this community.

2451
04:02:49,103 --> 04:02:52,665
And I would ask that the reverse 911 call go out.

2452
04:02:53,406 --> 04:02:57,208
I get calls for every particular road race and everything under the sun.

2453
04:02:57,708 --> 04:03:01,330
And this is an impact issue that affects the entire community.

2454
04:03:01,791 --> 04:03:03,852
And I think it's only appropriate we use our reverse.

2455
04:03:04,132 --> 04:03:10,017
9-1-1, and also to create the boilerplates to make it easier to file a complaint.

2456
04:03:10,677 --> 04:03:12,659
I looked up the complaints over the last several years.

2457
04:03:13,139 --> 04:03:26,670
It'll list all 60 or 70 communities that filed complaints, and I found it interesting, month after month, Method was in the top one, two, or three for number of complaints filed every month consistently.

2458
04:03:27,631 --> 04:03:40,456
So I think it shows you that this is an issue, Mr. President, and hopefully with the new representation we have now on the Community Advisory Committee, we're going to be able to get some results.

2459
04:03:41,597 --> 04:03:43,877
I'd like to concur with Vice President Marks.

2460
04:03:45,414 --> 04:03:55,841
that Peter and Luke, from having no representation, these two gentlemen in nine months have done more work than anyone can imagine.

2461
04:03:55,861 --> 04:04:02,885
I'll tell you, the knowledge that they've brought and the slides and the work they've done is just overwhelming.

2462
04:04:02,985 --> 04:04:10,230
And I think that if you listen to the people of Milton and these other cities that were there,

2463
04:04:11,103 --> 04:04:21,954
And the people from the MIT study says, you know, you have to stay on top of the FAA because the federal government allow the FAA to do these things.

2464
04:04:22,374 --> 04:04:32,724
So again, you know, you can send all the stuff you want to Massport and everywhere else, but it's our federal officials are the only ones who can stop this, and those are the ones

2465
04:04:33,693 --> 04:04:36,055
that we really need to hound to get this done.

2466
04:04:36,115 --> 04:04:39,217
And I say, we had some great representation there tonight.

2467
04:04:39,297 --> 04:04:45,201
I was there, Councilor De La Ruzo, Councilor Falco, Vice President Marx, we were there.

2468
04:04:45,882 --> 04:04:52,106
So we had good representation from our council to keep everybody abreast of what's happening there.

2469
04:04:52,967 --> 04:05:02,393
And again, Peter and Luke, those two men deserve a tremendous amount of respect in this community for the work that they've done in nine months.

2470
04:05:03,390 --> 04:05:04,171
Councilor Del Rosso.

2471
04:05:04,611 --> 04:05:06,052
Mr. President, thank you for that.

2472
04:05:06,672 --> 04:05:12,556
I too was very, very impressed with the amount of expertise that they've developed.

2473
04:05:13,216 --> 04:05:26,865
It's clear that the work of making headway with the FAA is going to be through contact

2474
04:05:27,577 --> 04:05:46,352
and petition to our federal delegation, to our representatives, to the House of Representatives, and also to our Senators, and through work in their offices, with the cooperation of Mass Watch at the FAA.

2475
04:05:46,392 --> 04:05:49,315
Because it seems to me from their presentations that

2476
04:05:52,077 --> 04:05:55,120
There's not going to be elimination of this noise.

2477
04:05:55,140 --> 04:06:08,372
There's going to have to be a way to find an equitable distribution of who's going to get some of the noise, some of the time.

2478
04:06:10,074 --> 04:06:16,200
And that's what we're going to have to live with, if I understood their presentations correctly.

2479
04:06:16,701 --> 04:06:21,846
But our efforts have to be focused, as you mentioned, on the federal level.

2480
04:06:22,687 --> 04:06:23,368
Councilor Belco.

2481
04:06:23,468 --> 04:06:24,529
Thank you, Mr. President.

2482
04:06:24,629 --> 04:06:27,532
I'd like to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

2483
04:06:29,381 --> 04:06:34,024
The meeting that Peter and Luke put on was a great meeting, great presentations.

2484
04:06:34,524 --> 04:06:35,945
They did one earlier in the spring.

2485
04:06:36,725 --> 04:06:46,811
Very informative, and it's nice to see that there are many people that are attending these meetings because it's a quality of life issue that impacts pretty much all the neighborhoods throughout our city.

2486
04:06:48,212 --> 04:06:55,976
But the most important thing that I really took out of this is really that it's a federal issue, and we really need to make sure that we contact

2487
04:06:57,654 --> 04:07:00,696
You know, Senator Markey, Senator Warren, Congresswoman Clark.

2488
04:07:00,876 --> 04:07:02,557
I mean, it's important.

2489
04:07:02,577 --> 04:07:10,923
They need to be involved in this, and we need to make sure that, you know, we have many people sending them letters so they know how we feel.

2490
04:07:11,323 --> 04:07:14,325
This is an issue that impacts all of us.

2491
04:07:14,605 --> 04:07:16,166
Like I said, it's a quality of life issue.

2492
04:07:16,186 --> 04:07:22,330
I think the boilerplate letters are a great idea, and it makes it easier for everyone.

2493
04:07:22,370 --> 04:07:24,291
So I support the resolution.

2494
04:07:24,572 --> 04:07:24,852
Thank you.

2495
04:07:27,377 --> 04:07:30,858
On the motion by Vice President Bach, seconded by Councilor Falco.

2496
04:07:31,758 --> 04:07:32,698
All those in favor?

2497
04:07:32,778 --> 04:07:32,858
Aye.

2498
04:07:33,118 --> 04:07:34,018
Motion passes.

2499
04:07:34,498 --> 04:07:36,339
I don't want to fall down the stairs.

2500
04:07:38,599 --> 04:07:39,399
Just really quick.

2501
04:07:39,419 --> 04:07:41,500
Sharma Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

2502
04:07:41,520 --> 04:07:45,921
A couple of important takeaways from that meeting for me were that we need to keep filing the complaints.

2503
04:07:46,341 --> 04:07:53,582
The volume of complaints are what our elected officials, our representatives, our senators use to show that our community is impacted.

2504
04:07:54,263 --> 04:07:59,185
So while it's great to write letters to our federal delegation, and I encourage you to write to Elizabeth Warren.

2505
04:07:59,225 --> 04:08:02,047
She is our representative on the Quiet Skies Caucus.

2506
04:08:02,207 --> 04:08:07,329
So that's in the federal level for making the skies quieter and more livable for all of us.

2507
04:08:07,729 --> 04:08:09,150
We need to keep filing the complaints.

2508
04:08:09,190 --> 04:08:10,931
Those are the numbers that they refer to.

2509
04:08:11,311 --> 04:08:17,934
If the complaints go down, that's how Milton got action was that their complaints were up, unique complaints, multiple complaints.

2510
04:08:18,415 --> 04:08:20,295
And that's what they're going to use for leverage.

2511
04:08:20,315 --> 04:08:21,956
So we need to keep filing those complaints.

2512
04:08:21,976 --> 04:08:22,857
So I hope that reverse 9-1-1

2513
04:08:23,848 --> 04:08:25,369
will get us some unique complaints.

2514
04:08:25,969 --> 04:08:26,889
Thank you.

2515
04:08:28,070 --> 04:08:28,810
Thank you.

2516
04:08:28,830 --> 04:08:30,270
17-642 offered by Councilor Langel-Kern.

2517
04:08:30,310 --> 04:08:40,274
Be it resolved that the administration look into purchasing flashing stop signs as a pilot program on at least 10 of our highly trafficked intersections.

2518
04:08:40,314 --> 04:08:41,254
Councilor Langel-Kern.

2519
04:08:41,534 --> 04:08:43,615
Thank you, President Carviello.

2520
04:08:43,835 --> 04:08:51,318
I put this on because as you drive through neighboring cities and towns, you always look at different ways

2521
04:08:52,458 --> 04:08:58,345
Cities and towns are trying to curb, obviously, speeding and create safer streets.

2522
04:08:59,186 --> 04:09:04,072
So I've had an interest in the last couple months since I've been seeing the flashing stop signs.

2523
04:09:04,152 --> 04:09:08,978
It definitely brings more attention to a stop sign, and it worked great from what I saw.

2524
04:09:08,998 --> 04:09:11,982
I was at the Traffic Commission meeting on Tuesday.

2525
04:09:12,361 --> 04:09:13,622
There are a number of issues on.

2526
04:09:13,982 --> 04:09:15,903
One specifically was on South Street.

2527
04:09:15,983 --> 04:09:21,707
There are a number of residents that are concerned with the traffic and the pedestrians crossing from the square.

2528
04:09:23,248 --> 04:09:27,991
There are three or four different crosswalks from both sides of South Street.

2529
04:09:28,632 --> 04:09:30,073
And I suggested this.

2530
04:09:30,133 --> 04:09:40,740
I said, have we looked into flashing stop signs, especially at the stop sign at Walnut and South, where you have hundreds of people going into the square and coming

2531
04:09:41,354 --> 04:09:43,737
heading into South Medford, crossing that roadway.

2532
04:09:43,757 --> 04:09:47,861
It's been busy the last, especially in the summer months.

2533
04:09:48,541 --> 04:09:56,209
And the chief of police said to me, stated to the residents that that's just something that needs to be, there needs to be funding allocated.

2534
04:09:56,229 --> 04:10:00,674
The traffic commission can't just vote to put a flashing stop sign in without the funding.

2535
04:10:00,754 --> 04:10:03,857
So I then put it on the council agenda.

2536
04:10:04,437 --> 04:10:11,867
Because I think it would be a great pilot program along with speed bumps and various crosswalks that we've been talking about for a long time.

2537
04:10:11,927 --> 04:10:19,557
But if we could investigate, see how much these flashing stop signs are and pilot them in a number of different highly trafficked areas.

2538
04:10:20,151 --> 04:10:25,073
busy intersections where there are a number of accidents, I think it would go a long way.

2539
04:10:25,113 --> 04:10:31,695
And I think it's just an addition to the new radar guns that we've all fought for and that we've received and are being put in place.

2540
04:10:32,255 --> 04:10:35,436
I believe new laser guns, new speed monitoring signs.

2541
04:10:35,776 --> 04:10:40,998
This is just another way to curb traffic, slow people down, make them realize there is a stop sign.

2542
04:10:41,038 --> 04:10:42,578
You need to stop for pedestrians.

2543
04:10:42,618 --> 04:10:45,199
You need to stop, obviously, for safety reasons.

2544
04:10:45,639 --> 04:10:47,480
And this is a way I think that will definitely help.

2545
04:10:48,001 --> 04:10:53,538
So if we could roll call vote on this and purchase, look into purchasing and purchase 10.

2546
04:10:55,118 --> 04:10:58,340
blinking stop signs, I think it will go a long way.

2547
04:10:58,380 --> 04:10:59,280
You can see how it does.

2548
04:10:59,880 --> 04:11:00,241
Thank you.

2549
04:11:00,261 --> 04:11:01,261
What a wonderful measure.

2550
04:11:01,301 --> 04:11:20,390
And I was pleased, I forget what venue it was in, but recently at some point this summertime, I believe I heard the mayor announce that she was pursuing this, this exploration and was working on it as an effort for traffic calming measures.

2551
04:11:21,130 --> 04:11:21,451
Thank you.

2552
04:11:22,491 --> 04:11:22,991
Councilor Knight.

2553
04:11:23,591 --> 04:11:25,672
Mr. President, I find this to be a great resolution.

2554
04:11:26,192 --> 04:11:33,555
I hope the councilor doesn't mind if I amend it and give 10 recommended intersections that we can place flashing stop signs at.

2555
04:11:34,015 --> 04:11:36,596
No, in all seriousness, this is a great resolution.

2556
04:11:36,656 --> 04:11:38,296
It's something that the community needs.

2557
04:11:39,077 --> 04:11:47,219
I was just sitting on Woburn Street the other day, and I watched five cars in a row going 35 miles an hour blow through a four-way stop sign, just one after another.

2558
04:11:47,239 --> 04:11:48,540
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

2559
04:11:49,540 --> 04:12:03,544
So it's getting to the point now where the cut through traffic is not only becoming a problem with congestion, but they're also getting pretty familiar and bold and almost have a contempt now for the rules of the road that we have here in our community, Mr. President.

2560
04:12:03,564 --> 04:12:04,664
So I think this is a great measure.

2561
04:12:04,704 --> 04:12:15,468
Anything that can raise awareness to drivers and bring some more controls to the area for pedestrian safety is something that I'll always support.

2562
04:12:15,668 --> 04:12:16,588
This is a great resolution.

2563
04:12:17,894 --> 04:12:19,055
Name and address of the record, please.

2564
04:12:19,855 --> 04:12:21,697
Andrew Castaneda, Cushing Street, 02155.

2565
04:12:22,697 --> 04:12:41,630
I want to thank Councilor Piano for bringing this resolution forward, especially when in 2001, I believe, we had a large meeting with the neighborhood crime watch at the old train station, I believe, on Washington Street, former Redskins building.

2566
04:12:42,711 --> 04:12:45,573
And that's when the new schools were opening, I believe.

2567
04:12:47,065 --> 04:13:06,394
And I asked the chief of police if he could get installed a push button stoplight so the children could cross Riverside Avenue onto the newly created Freedom Way, the two schools, Dr. Andrews and McGlynn.

2568
04:13:07,415 --> 04:13:11,537
And basically, his reply, I believe, was Andrew, that costs $100,000.

2569
04:13:14,364 --> 04:13:19,247
And I said, well, basically, I'm just asking for a push-button stop, not a full-fledged.

2570
04:13:19,267 --> 04:13:19,707
It cost $100,000.

2571
04:13:20,147 --> 04:13:26,171
So nothing has ever been put there except a crosswalk, I believe.

2572
04:13:26,191 --> 04:13:37,418
If I'm not mistaken, not long ago, within 12 months, on High Street, they put something in real quick when the child was almost hit by a car, they say.

2573
04:13:38,318 --> 04:13:41,260
And it's on High Street in front of this book school, I believe.

2574
04:13:43,487 --> 04:14:07,833
I would like to confide with Councilor Knight also, if I could have a request to put it there, because that crosswalk, the dangerous street, Riverside Avenue, and furthermore, it's used 12 months a year, not just for the school year, because of the park, footpath, bike paths, partial bike paths, soccer fields, et cetera, Little League.

2575
04:14:11,538 --> 04:14:12,739
for us.

2576
04:14:12,759 --> 04:14:14,941
Thank you.

2577
04:14:16,062 --> 04:14:17,042
Thank you, Mr. President.

2578
04:14:17,223 --> 04:14:19,625
And I want to thank Council Longo Kern for bringing this up.

2579
04:14:20,866 --> 04:14:26,971
I've been talking about traffic calming initiatives in this city for the better part of a lot of years.

2580
04:14:28,132 --> 04:14:40,662
But needless to say, Mr. President, I agree with this, but I think procedurally we have a commission that is responsible for signage in any traffic calming initiatives.

2581
04:14:41,222 --> 04:14:44,105
markings on roads, that is the Traffic Commission.

2582
04:14:44,726 --> 04:14:56,437
So I would respectfully ask my Council colleague if we can send this to the Traffic Commission, let them review the need for these particular flashing stop signs.

2583
04:14:57,017 --> 04:15:03,061
And then the request be sent to the administration for the purchasing based on their recommendation.

2584
04:15:03,502 --> 04:15:11,427
So I think this is kind of putting the cart before the horse, asking to purchase signs and not go through the appropriate body first.

2585
04:15:11,467 --> 04:15:13,889
So that's the only change I'd make.

2586
04:15:14,009 --> 04:15:15,690
I support this wholeheartedly.

2587
04:15:16,290 --> 04:15:17,491
I like the flashing signs.

2588
04:15:17,551 --> 04:15:19,132
I like raised crosswalks.

2589
04:15:19,573 --> 04:15:22,354
I like, you know, cutouts, bump outs.

2590
04:15:22,735 --> 04:15:24,376
I like all that traffic calming.

2591
04:15:25,637 --> 04:15:32,342
So that was the one thing I'd ask my council colleague, if she would amend it and send it to the Traffic Commission for us for their input.

2592
04:15:32,942 --> 04:15:34,864
I think maybe we could do both at the same time.

2593
04:15:34,884 --> 04:15:36,645
I think that's a good resolve.

2594
04:15:36,745 --> 04:15:41,329
Ask the administration to look into pricing and send it to the Traffic Commission.

2595
04:15:41,689 --> 04:15:48,494
When I was there on Tuesday, they said it seemed like that was something they would definitely want to implement, but didn't have the funding for it.

2596
04:15:48,594 --> 04:15:50,476
So I think sending it to the Traffic Commission,

2597
04:15:51,522 --> 04:15:58,922
figure out where the locations would be, because we'd all probably fight over, we'd want a hundred of them between the seven of us.

2598
04:15:59,504 --> 04:16:15,732
but if we could have them designate where these 10 spots would be or more if we can afford it and have the administration try to figure out how much they would cost and what funding we have and how many we could purchase, I think we could collectively be able to implement it within a reasonable amount of time.

2599
04:16:15,752 --> 04:16:20,394
So are you going to amend it to send it both to the administration and the traffic commission?

2600
04:16:20,434 --> 04:16:20,895
Yes, please.

2601
04:16:20,955 --> 04:16:21,835
Move approval.

2602
04:16:22,395 --> 04:16:27,118
On the motion that we send this vote to the administration,

2603
04:16:27,878 --> 04:16:29,639
in the traffic commission.

2604
04:16:30,440 --> 04:16:35,524
Motion has been on the motion of approval by Councilor DelaRusso, seconded by Councilor Langel-Kern.

2605
04:16:36,484 --> 04:16:37,205
All those in favor?

2606
04:16:37,385 --> 04:16:37,485
Aye.

2607
04:16:37,985 --> 04:16:38,806
Motion passes.

2608
04:16:38,826 --> 04:16:39,266
17-6.

2609
04:16:39,386 --> 04:16:45,951
Mr. President, just if I could, not to have any confusion, but I think we have to word it a little different.

2610
04:16:45,971 --> 04:16:54,317
If we're going to send the mayor a request to look into purchasing flashing stop signs, we're certainly not going to ask the traffic commission to look into purchasing

2611
04:16:55,012 --> 04:16:55,913
Flashing stop signs.

2612
04:16:55,933 --> 04:16:58,916
We're going to ask them to look into the feasibility.

2613
04:16:58,936 --> 04:17:00,738
And locations.

2614
04:17:01,259 --> 04:17:04,422
Feasibility and location.

2615
04:17:06,264 --> 04:17:07,465
If we could amend that, Mr. Clerk.

2616
04:17:07,565 --> 04:17:12,690
Mr. President, I think this is where it becomes important that we get the traffic engineer on board.

2617
04:17:12,730 --> 04:17:23,219
We get the traffic engineer on the payroll, because the traffic engineer is probably going to be the one that's going to be able to determine where the best locations are and where we're going to get the most bang for our buck and the most impact.

2618
04:17:23,239 --> 04:17:25,000
I think that's what Chief Sacco was saying to me.

2619
04:17:25,040 --> 04:17:28,083
And I think Chief Sacco is on the right track when he talks about that.

2620
04:17:28,163 --> 04:17:32,767
I mean, Chief Sacco, I think, is more excited than anybody to have a traffic engineer come on board here in the city.

2621
04:17:33,768 --> 04:17:46,354
for the last 20 somewhat years, he's been the one that's been wearing the badge that says this is where the stop sign goes, this is where the do not enter sign goes after the deliberations from the Traffic Commission.

2622
04:17:46,394 --> 04:17:49,356
So I think this traffic engineer is going to add some professionalism.

2623
04:17:49,396 --> 04:17:55,079
It's going to allow us to have some data-driven decision making, Mr. President, as opposed to some reactionary decision making.

2624
04:17:55,119 --> 04:17:56,079
So I'm looking forward to it.

2625
04:17:56,099 --> 04:17:57,540
But I think this, again, is a great resolve.

2626
04:17:58,220 --> 04:17:59,401
Council marks on the right track.

2627
04:17:59,441 --> 04:18:19,520
I mean we can ask the traffic commission they implement but on the locations I think really should be up to them in the traffic engineer the people that have the ability to make data during decisions All right, so as amended that change the wording all right 17 6 4 3 offered by president care of yellow be a resolved

2628
04:18:19,938 --> 04:18:25,182
that the Memphis City Council commend and congratulate Deacon Mark Rumley on his recent assignment to St.

2629
04:18:25,843 --> 04:18:29,245
Raphael's Parish by Archbishop Sean O'Malley.

2630
04:18:30,626 --> 04:18:38,052
It was announced a couple weeks ago that our city solicitor, Deacon Rumley, will be joining the staff at St.

2631
04:18:38,092 --> 04:18:45,638
Ray's, and I just wish him good luck on his new assignment there, and I know the people in the community were also excited about having him there also.

2632
04:18:46,539 --> 04:18:46,699
Yeah.

2633
04:18:47,619 --> 04:18:48,600
Receive a motion to receive.

2634
04:18:50,320 --> 04:18:53,624
Motion by Councilor Del Rosso, seconded by Councilor Scott Pelley.

2635
04:18:53,944 --> 04:18:54,605
All those in favor?

2636
04:18:54,765 --> 04:18:54,925
Aye.

2637
04:18:55,466 --> 04:18:57,528
Motion passes.

2638
04:18:57,548 --> 04:18:59,650
17-638 offered by Councilor Lococo and be it resolved.

2639
04:19:00,370 --> 04:19:09,055
that the Memphis City Council provide the criteria of how one can become a member of TV3 and how one can get a video aired on TV3.

2640
04:19:09,375 --> 04:19:10,275
Council Member O'Karen.

2641
04:19:10,836 --> 04:19:12,196
Thank you, President Carviello.

2642
04:19:12,276 --> 04:19:20,001
I'm actually asking that we be provided the criteria of how one can become a member of TV3 and get a video aired.

2643
04:19:20,181 --> 04:19:24,083
I think it's, people are very excited about TV3, it's opening.

2644
04:19:24,910 --> 04:19:26,711
And people also have questions.

2645
04:19:26,751 --> 04:19:31,333
There's been scuttlebutt of whether or not you need a quarter report filled out.

2646
04:19:31,514 --> 04:19:37,357
I think that's obviously something that may be needed because it is located within the high school.

2647
04:19:37,417 --> 04:19:39,898
So that's obviously understandable.

2648
04:19:40,298 --> 04:19:43,000
But if we could just get a list of what is going to be required.

2649
04:19:43,060 --> 04:19:45,621
Is it going to be a contract that's going to need to be signed?

2650
04:19:46,037 --> 04:19:47,817
How long will it take to be quarried?

2651
04:19:47,858 --> 04:19:49,498
When can you get a video aired?

2652
04:19:49,518 --> 04:19:52,339
And how will you be able to get a video aired?

2653
04:19:52,359 --> 04:19:53,919
I think that's important for the public to know.

2654
04:19:53,939 --> 04:19:58,800
Now that we have a new station, people really want to get involved.

2655
04:19:58,941 --> 04:20:03,362
And it's just common information that probably should be posted and figured out.

2656
04:20:03,382 --> 04:20:05,622
Name and address of the record, please.

2657
04:20:06,783 --> 04:20:07,643
Good evening, Councillors.

2658
04:20:07,703 --> 04:20:11,184
Ben Brown, station manager, City of Medford, Medford Community Media.

2659
04:20:12,826 --> 04:20:18,715
I brought with me mine, the form for how to get a show on the air.

2660
04:20:18,855 --> 04:20:22,741
It is several pages, and I apologize if it wasn't in your packet ahead of time.

2661
04:20:24,930 --> 04:20:27,892
Simply, to fill out, to get a show on the air, there is this form.

2662
04:20:27,972 --> 04:20:36,416
Once it's filled out, it does require a quarry form also to be submitted the first time the resident submits programming.

2663
04:20:37,877 --> 04:20:40,819
And after that, they can submit programming as many times as they like.

2664
04:20:40,839 --> 04:20:46,802
As far as becoming a member goes, we're gonna have an open house on October 15th from 10 to noon.

2665
04:20:47,642 --> 04:20:52,365
And we'll be signing members up then in a more official way.

2666
04:20:53,085 --> 04:20:54,488
It's over 15th, 10 to noon?

2667
04:20:54,868 --> 04:20:55,008
Yep.

2668
04:20:57,192 --> 04:21:05,144
And if I may, through the chair, the CORI form, once one does come in and fill it out, how long is the process to get that back and approved?

2669
04:21:06,046 --> 04:21:06,867
It's not long.

2670
04:21:08,042 --> 04:21:08,423
24 hours.

2671
04:21:08,443 --> 04:21:14,106
We normally wouldn't start airing programming the same hour that programming came in anyways.

2672
04:21:15,327 --> 04:21:19,270
We usually air schedules on a weekly basis.

2673
04:21:19,310 --> 04:21:22,412
So if you came in on Monday, it may not air until Friday.

2674
04:21:22,432 --> 04:21:26,555
That's just logistically the timing to get the programming in and started.

2675
04:21:27,095 --> 04:21:29,437
That's not to say it wouldn't happen faster than that, though.

2676
04:21:32,339 --> 04:21:36,782
And it does look like there's a contract here, producer agreement and indemnification.

2677
04:21:37,348 --> 04:21:40,331
And once that's signed, who's gonna keep hold of that?

2678
04:22:00,477 --> 04:22:09,762
I think we're just getting this, so I think that's, how can somebody, do they have to come in and apply to be a member, apply in person, or will this be online?

2679
04:22:09,863 --> 04:22:16,386
It will be online once the media center has a website, but that's a couple weeks-ish away.

2680
04:22:18,988 --> 04:22:21,609
But if anyone wants to email me, I'm happy to send it back to them.

2681
04:22:22,530 --> 04:22:24,091
And I have sent it back to a few people.

2682
04:22:25,877 --> 04:22:28,938
So have you had anybody sign the agreement and become members yet?

2683
04:22:29,338 --> 04:22:40,521
I've had one come back to me that's been fully signed, and I have a few others that are out now.

2684
04:22:43,782 --> 04:22:44,083
Thank you.

2685
04:22:44,683 --> 04:22:45,163
Councilor Day.

2686
04:22:46,100 --> 04:22:46,861
Ben, welcome aboard.

2687
04:22:47,381 --> 04:22:47,661
Thank you.

2688
04:22:47,781 --> 04:22:51,044
We've had the opportunity to see you at your finest hour.

2689
04:22:51,064 --> 04:22:54,566
We had a couple of council meetings over there in the media center, and things went well.

2690
04:22:54,646 --> 04:22:57,528
It's certainly a lot cooler in there than it is in here, and the lights aren't as bright.

2691
04:22:58,769 --> 04:23:11,799
But with that being said, can you tell us a little bit about your experience so far being there, based upon where you've been in the past and where you are now, what you think the direction the media center can go in, and what we should expect?

2692
04:23:12,628 --> 04:23:17,874
Sure, so I'm coming to Medford from the town of Brookline.

2693
04:23:18,555 --> 04:23:19,696
I was there for seven years.

2694
04:23:19,756 --> 04:23:22,499
Previous to that, I was in the city of Northampton.

2695
04:23:24,020 --> 04:23:32,670
In both the media centers that I worked in in the past, they've had a long record of being the media center for all three of the channels.

2696
04:23:33,310 --> 04:23:35,972
And Medford used to be known as TV3.

2697
04:23:37,033 --> 04:23:41,296
Now, I've been asked to help support all three of the channels.

2698
04:23:42,617 --> 04:23:47,761
And as part of that, we decided on the name Medford Community Media, as opposed to just TV3.

2699
04:23:49,122 --> 04:23:57,868
And going forward, I would hope that we could work to be a model of media centers around the state and around the country.

2700
04:23:58,467 --> 04:24:10,775
providing media training and education, providing some media literacy education, and as well as the normal public access programming that everyone has known and loves.

2701
04:24:12,736 --> 04:24:18,520
And in terms of programming right now, obviously the TV Guide right now.

2702
04:24:20,117 --> 04:24:23,398
Yeah, so there is... I'm a big Three Stooges fan.

2703
04:24:23,998 --> 04:24:25,798
There is some programming on the channel.

2704
04:24:25,918 --> 04:24:29,579
It's all educational programming and public domain movies.

2705
04:24:30,379 --> 04:24:40,661
There was one form that came back to me today that is a resident who makes both an English language and a Russian language program, interview program.

2706
04:24:41,401 --> 04:24:44,542
That'll be on within the next couple days.

2707
04:24:45,982 --> 04:24:51,926
There is a cooking show that has been requested be aired.

2708
04:24:52,547 --> 04:24:53,808
I haven't gotten the form back.

2709
04:24:53,888 --> 04:25:03,875
There's a music program that's been made in the city of Medford that's been requested, but I haven't received the form yet.

2710
04:25:04,915 --> 04:25:12,561
And other programming would be things like NASA TV and other news programs from around the country.

2711
04:25:13,261 --> 04:25:16,402
And where can an individual find out what's playing and when?

2712
04:25:16,982 --> 04:25:20,403
So right now, you can't because we don't have a website.

2713
04:25:20,483 --> 04:25:22,304
Once there's a website, it'll all be on our website.

2714
04:25:22,884 --> 04:25:32,927
My hope would be that in the future, there is a push for Comcast and Verizon to include the media centers as part of the electronic program guide.

2715
04:25:33,468 --> 04:25:40,770
And I would hope that we could adopt that in Medford soon, though it's a complex issue at the Comcast and Verizon level.

2716
04:25:41,430 --> 04:25:42,251
Great, awesome.

2717
04:25:42,291 --> 04:25:42,831
Thank you very much.

2718
04:25:42,851 --> 04:25:43,431
Keep up the good work.

2719
04:25:43,451 --> 04:25:44,192
The place looks great.

2720
04:25:44,832 --> 04:25:49,815
I think you're doing a great job.

2721
04:25:49,836 --> 04:25:50,336
Thank you.

2722
04:25:50,636 --> 04:25:51,196
Mr. President?

2723
04:25:51,356 --> 04:25:54,418
Mr. President?

2724
04:25:55,539 --> 04:25:56,800
Mr. President?

2725
04:25:56,880 --> 04:25:57,781
Thank you, Mr. President.

2726
04:25:58,701 --> 04:25:59,822
This question is for Ben.

2727
04:25:59,862 --> 04:26:05,566
Ben, I just had a question for you.

2728
04:26:05,626 --> 04:26:08,808
What involvement did you have in putting together this particular

2729
04:26:09,720 --> 04:26:10,921
application?

2730
04:26:11,081 --> 04:26:18,926
So there are some standard forms that are used in other centers around the state.

2731
04:26:19,767 --> 04:26:25,811
I took that and submitted it to the city.

2732
04:26:26,912 --> 04:26:33,537
So the original language is from me, but I'm not an attorney, and I don't represent one as the city.

2733
04:26:33,577 --> 04:26:37,579
So I couldn't venture to say that that's my writing up there.

2734
04:26:38,786 --> 04:26:48,853
So just if I can understand better, what was the discussion or thoughts regarding first-time submitters will be required to fill out a core reform?

2735
04:26:49,873 --> 04:26:53,055
I believe that has to do with the location of the media center.

2736
04:26:54,416 --> 04:27:01,061
So the fact that the media center is located at the high school, we're requesting core reforms?

2737
04:27:01,581 --> 04:27:02,281
I believe so, yes.

2738
04:27:03,042 --> 04:27:03,102
OK.

2739
04:27:03,817 --> 04:27:07,679
And I was under the impression that this had a separate entrance.

2740
04:27:08,459 --> 04:27:16,544
I was under the impression that the new media center would be used on off hours.

2741
04:27:17,844 --> 04:27:18,645
Is that not correct?

2742
04:27:19,905 --> 04:27:22,267
That is correct.

2743
04:27:22,387 --> 04:27:25,588
We are planning on having hours outside of the school day, yes.

2744
04:27:26,169 --> 04:27:27,089
OK.

2745
04:27:27,109 --> 04:27:30,431
Because I really have a concern with this.

2746
04:27:30,891 --> 04:27:32,612
And let me tell you what my concern is.

2747
04:27:33,441 --> 04:28:01,354
that if the requirement of a quarry is based on the fact that this is housed here at the high school, and the fact that we have outside non-resident organizations that are renting out our school facilities, and as far as I know, not required to fill out quarry forms that are occupying our school buildings,

2748
04:28:02,398 --> 04:28:16,648
How would that be any different than someone coming up here from the community that's in a room that's dedicated for that purpose with no access, the way I understand it, into the high school, then be required to fill out a core reform.

2749
04:28:17,228 --> 04:28:30,077
But if I live in Lexington, I can come up here on a Saturday, spend hours in the building, bring in rolling luggage with me, occupy classrooms under lock and key,

2750
04:28:31,497 --> 04:28:34,438
in a building that houses our students without a quarry check.

2751
04:28:34,778 --> 04:28:39,279
And this question may not be for you, it may be for the superintendent of schools.

2752
04:28:40,179 --> 04:28:45,780
I just, I wanna better understand why we're requiring a quarry for local access.

2753
04:28:46,380 --> 04:29:01,124
And if what you're telling me is because it's up at the high school, but then we have people renting out these buildings, numerous people renting out these buildings, and not requiring a quarry to be inside these buildings,

2754
04:29:02,365 --> 04:29:03,666
I have a concern.

2755
04:29:04,126 --> 04:29:05,686
I want to know what's going on here.

2756
04:29:05,786 --> 04:29:07,707
I unfortunately can't speak directly to that.

2757
04:29:08,027 --> 04:29:10,428
Um, I can only speak to the form.

2758
04:29:11,249 --> 04:29:18,652
Um, and you know, the form states that because it's located in the high school, that's why the court check is being requested.

2759
04:29:18,972 --> 04:29:26,915
So maybe the superintendent schools, I don't want to put you on the spot, Mr Bellson, but maybe maybe if you can answer that, you stay to the late hour.

2760
04:29:26,975 --> 04:29:27,095
So

2761
04:29:29,355 --> 04:29:34,398
So I'm here, Mr. Vice President, as tonight's security, because you were concerned about that.

2762
04:29:35,138 --> 04:29:35,739
I just wanted to make sure.

2763
04:29:35,899 --> 04:29:37,079
Oh, you're providing the security.

2764
04:29:37,280 --> 04:29:38,640
I'm wearing blue, so.

2765
04:29:39,881 --> 04:29:40,762
It's good to know.

2766
04:29:41,042 --> 04:29:41,742
It's good to know.

2767
04:29:42,202 --> 04:29:43,303
You feel safe?

2768
04:29:44,904 --> 04:29:45,304
We'll see.

2769
04:29:45,364 --> 04:29:46,025
What's your answer?

2770
04:29:46,105 --> 04:29:46,805
OK.

2771
04:29:47,666 --> 04:29:53,509
So we do quarry checks on everyone who has unsupervised contact with students.

2772
04:29:54,530 --> 04:29:58,612
And that's anyone who works here, a contractor, anyone who comes in like that.

2773
04:29:59,356 --> 04:30:09,265
Now, there is a dedicated door that you can't go from the studio into the high school once it's fully operational.

2774
04:30:09,285 --> 04:30:13,609
Obviously, we're still using it with students so they can go during the school day.

2775
04:30:14,289 --> 04:30:21,096
But there are any number of activities that students have that people coming up here in the afternoon might interact with them.

2776
04:30:21,840 --> 04:30:38,911
And so, you know, I think that the city, and you know, I don't have an objection to taking the extra step in making sure that anyone who might be up here frequently, who is moving around that area outside of the studio into the area, might find their way into the front door at a given time.

2777
04:30:39,811 --> 04:30:41,793
we check it out a little bit.

2778
04:30:42,233 --> 04:30:52,520
As far as other groups go, we've rented properties for years, and we haven't required it because generally they're under the supervision of people, and the people there are on a volunteer basis.

2779
04:30:53,061 --> 04:30:58,965
So it really isn't exactly the same thing, but it doesn't hurt to have the extra measure of precaution.

2780
04:31:00,105 --> 04:31:19,815
I'm just trying to figure out, Mr. Superintendent, if this is a new standard that we're implementing because the media centers up here at the high school, or for that reason, any other building, then why does it not trickle down to organizations that have full access to these buildings?

2781
04:31:20,675 --> 04:31:24,677
And why wouldn't we want to secure our buildings to that extent?

2782
04:31:25,657 --> 04:31:28,639
And are you willing to make that commitment?

2783
04:31:33,443 --> 04:31:34,504
Our students are here.

2784
04:31:34,924 --> 04:31:37,966
So if we had a coach, and they were coaching on the field, they'd be quarried.

2785
04:31:38,907 --> 04:31:44,450
If we have a rental out there, they're not our students.

2786
04:31:44,711 --> 04:31:47,713
So it's not unsupervised contact with students.

2787
04:31:48,153 --> 04:31:49,734
That's the requirement of the court.

2788
04:31:49,754 --> 04:31:52,916
Right, but they have access to our building.

2789
04:31:52,936 --> 04:31:55,618
Yeah, but access to the building isn't the standard.

2790
04:31:55,638 --> 04:31:57,319
There are people who have access to the building.

2791
04:31:57,559 --> 04:31:58,580
A parent comes up here.

2792
04:32:01,345 --> 04:32:02,826
get checked in, but they're not quarried.

2793
04:32:03,046 --> 04:32:04,728
So access to the building is one thing.

2794
04:32:05,008 --> 04:32:09,851
The standard for quarrying is unsupervised contact with students.

2795
04:32:10,472 --> 04:32:23,462
So for instance, on Saturdays, you know there's a program up here on Saturdays where hundreds of people, mostly from outside this community, come in and use the classrooms, use the facilities, use the cafeteria.

2796
04:32:24,302 --> 04:32:32,646
And in my opinion, you might say they're supervised by their own staff, not by our staff, by their own staff.

2797
04:32:33,066 --> 04:32:43,611
Why wouldn't that then trigger off this new requirement of being in a building unsupervised that, you know, could have a potential risk?

2798
04:32:44,211 --> 04:32:50,674
Look, you can have a person walking on the street and have them contact with someone who's inappropriate.

2799
04:32:51,695 --> 04:32:52,595
In this building,

2800
04:32:53,347 --> 04:33:07,912
When we have a rental, and we have a situation where people, let's say the Japanese language school, because that's the sanity reference you're making, they have their own students, they have their own people, they have their own coverages, they supervise their students.

2801
04:33:08,552 --> 04:33:10,433
We're not responsible for their students.

2802
04:33:11,883 --> 04:33:20,510
But anyone who works with our students, if we had an athletic team, if we had a club that met on the weekend, whoever is a supervisor has a glory check.

2803
04:33:20,810 --> 04:33:23,732
And on top of that, most instances has a fingerprint check.

2804
04:33:23,812 --> 04:33:32,920
But wouldn't we have a responsibility, Mr. Superintendent, to our students that attend the public schools, that whoever we're letting into the building,

2805
04:33:33,948 --> 04:33:37,270
rental, whatever the purpose, that we know who they are.

2806
04:33:37,871 --> 04:33:49,740
And the reason why you're requesting a quarry is to check the background of someone that's coming into the building, that's using the media center, and that you want to know who they are.

2807
04:33:49,980 --> 04:33:53,763
And you want to make sure that the quarry, because the quarry's for a reason.

2808
04:33:54,883 --> 04:33:58,306
You know, you're doing a background investigation on the person.

2809
04:33:58,706 --> 04:34:12,877
But then again, we're saying, we'll allow hundreds of people up here with luggage, wheeled in luggage, and access to every classroom in this community, in this school, and not have the same type of requirements.

2810
04:34:14,037 --> 04:34:15,719
I just don't understand.

2811
04:34:15,779 --> 04:34:18,861
I'm just trying to figure out what the policy and procedure is.

2812
04:34:19,241 --> 04:34:20,542
But you're making two different things.

2813
04:34:20,582 --> 04:34:26,226
So, for example, on parents night, parents come up for curriculum night, we don't quarry every parent who comes in the door.

2814
04:34:26,766 --> 04:34:28,648
I'm not talking about parents.

2815
04:34:28,688 --> 04:34:29,788
But they could.

2816
04:34:29,868 --> 04:34:30,909
A parent is a person.

2817
04:34:31,450 --> 04:34:34,932
I'm not talking about, you're talking about something that I'm not talking about.

2818
04:34:35,612 --> 04:34:38,493
I'm talking about the renting of our facilities.

2819
04:34:38,533 --> 04:34:44,274
You're talking about a type of person in the building, but there's all kinds of people who come into this building who are not quarried.

2820
04:34:44,794 --> 04:34:45,114
Right.

2821
04:34:45,174 --> 04:35:03,698
So if we're going to require a quarry for someone using a particular room, a media room, that doesn't have access to high school, maybe we should require a quarry for people that are coming into the building, that are renting the building, and not just this high school, as you know, other school facilities,

2822
04:35:04,258 --> 04:35:08,480
and make it so that we have a responsibility to safeguard our students.

2823
04:35:08,941 --> 04:35:15,344
Because, in my opinion, Mr. Superintendent, there's no way that we're supervising what's going on.

2824
04:35:15,664 --> 04:35:23,949
We're relying on people that are renting to make sure it's a secure atmosphere and make sure that our students are safe come Monday morning.

2825
04:35:24,469 --> 04:35:26,770
And that is a concern I have, Mr. Superintendent.

2826
04:35:27,070 --> 04:35:30,913
I understand what you're saying, but that's not the standard of Corey.

2827
04:35:32,294 --> 04:35:50,355
The Corey check requires when a person has unsupervised contact, a frequent visitor kind of thing, so if a person's going to use the media studio, and they're going to come up here more than once, I assume they're going to try to use the studio more than once, they're not becoming a member to only have one production or one activity.

2828
04:35:50,953 --> 04:35:56,234
So they're a frequent action person up here, and so it doesn't hurt to know who they are.

2829
04:35:56,654 --> 04:35:57,014
That's all.

2830
04:35:57,274 --> 04:35:59,475
Right, but it would be supervision, correct?

2831
04:35:59,635 --> 04:36:00,875
Is that studio left unmanned?

2832
04:36:00,895 --> 04:36:02,535
They won't be supervising students?

2833
04:36:03,195 --> 04:36:10,597
No, no, I'm talking if someone's gonna come up here and use the media center, is there not, Dan, someone that's gonna be supervising?

2834
04:36:10,617 --> 04:36:13,417
Or will that be unmanned?

2835
04:36:13,497 --> 04:36:14,097
They could.

2836
04:36:14,117 --> 04:36:17,018
I'm asking with all due respect to the gentleman.

2837
04:36:18,477 --> 04:36:20,198
Does your facility go unsupervised?

2838
04:36:20,278 --> 04:36:22,860
It will not go unsupervised to an extent.

2839
04:36:23,540 --> 04:36:31,045
I think the point is that they could walk out of the media center by accident, right?

2840
04:36:31,065 --> 04:36:33,146
They could walk into the front of the building.

2841
04:36:33,306 --> 04:36:36,668
They go out the main door of the studio.

2842
04:36:36,748 --> 04:36:44,313
So similar to the hundreds of people that come in here every Saturday, could walk into any area of the building.

2843
04:36:47,495 --> 04:36:49,976
Mr. Superintendent, I don't want to belabor the point.

2844
04:36:50,316 --> 04:37:00,162
I'm just trying to figure out if this is a new policy or procedure based on the fact that people coming up to the high school or any of our schools, I think it should be carried out across the board.

2845
04:37:00,183 --> 04:37:00,963
That's all I'm saying.

2846
04:37:01,904 --> 04:37:05,386
Now you're getting back to the parents again, and I'm talking about rentals.

2847
04:37:09,288 --> 04:37:12,409
I don't know how I can lay that out any easier.

2848
04:37:12,749 --> 04:37:14,190
Rentals and parents.

2849
04:37:26,035 --> 04:37:28,317
including everybody sitting around the table tonight.

2850
04:37:28,357 --> 04:37:31,419
Well, it doesn't seem like much thought went into this scoring process.

2851
04:37:32,140 --> 04:37:35,182
It seemed like it was just isolated to the media center.

2852
04:37:35,723 --> 04:37:36,904
And that's all I'm bringing up.

2853
04:37:37,004 --> 04:37:38,645
I just want to know what the thoughts are.

2854
04:37:38,945 --> 04:37:40,326
I wasn't involved in creating this.

2855
04:37:40,346 --> 04:37:42,028
So I just want to know what the thoughts are.

2856
04:37:42,048 --> 04:37:45,150
I don't think it's unreasonable if a person is going to be up here

2857
04:37:48,397 --> 04:37:50,877
and have access to a particular area of the building.

2858
04:37:51,638 --> 04:37:55,198
So the rentals we have are frequent rentals.

2859
04:37:55,838 --> 04:38:02,400
And some of these organizations have been renting for, I'd venture to say, 10, 15 years.

2860
04:38:02,420 --> 04:38:06,000
I don't know how much more frequent you can get than that, Mr. Superintendent.

2861
04:38:06,760 --> 04:38:07,540
And maybe longer.

2862
04:38:08,121 --> 04:38:13,722
And I never see a request to have other people storied that are using our buildings.

2863
04:38:13,742 --> 04:38:15,582
They're not working with our students directly.

2864
04:38:16,082 --> 04:38:18,545
working with their students, their population.

2865
04:38:18,905 --> 04:38:22,408
And someone going to the media room is not working with our students directly either.

2866
04:38:22,749 --> 04:38:23,369
They could.

2867
04:38:24,911 --> 04:38:26,933
All right, look, it's obviously a discussion.

2868
04:38:26,953 --> 04:38:28,935
All right, thank you.

2869
04:38:29,095 --> 04:38:30,796
Counselor DelaRusso.

2870
04:38:30,836 --> 04:38:32,278
Just one suggestion, please.

2871
04:38:33,419 --> 04:38:39,324
Motion that the city solicitor be sent this question

2872
04:38:39,985 --> 04:38:55,000
as to how this questionnaire developed and what the standard was used to institute the query and ask for an answer from the city solicitor.

2873
04:38:56,482 --> 04:38:57,683
This way we can get an answer.

2874
04:38:58,994 --> 04:39:03,436
rather than be swallowed up by endless speculation and debate.

2875
04:39:04,776 --> 04:39:06,197
What I'll do is respect that.

2876
04:39:06,237 --> 04:39:08,417
It's not speculation and debate.

2877
04:39:08,617 --> 04:39:14,880
If the gentleman had students in the public schools, he would be looking out for the safety of the students.

2878
04:39:15,160 --> 04:39:16,700
That's what my concern is, Mr. President.

2879
04:39:19,410 --> 04:39:22,452
Ben, if you could tell me, the Cori check is required.

2880
04:39:22,492 --> 04:39:24,353
What if the Cori check does not come back clean?

2881
04:39:24,453 --> 04:39:33,859
Is the person now precluded from being able to utilize the studio, or is it just so that you know that there is someone in there that might have a questionable background that needs to be monitored more closely?

2882
04:39:33,879 --> 04:39:37,421
The way the policy is written, they would be precluded from using the studio.

2883
04:39:38,122 --> 04:39:38,422
Thank you.

2884
04:39:41,424 --> 04:39:42,525
Name and address of the record, please.

2885
04:39:42,545 --> 04:39:42,925
I'm sorry.

2886
04:40:01,449 --> 04:40:09,717
Number two, we had Mr. Brown come up here and talk about the father of this producer's agreement and the demarcation for it.

2887
04:40:10,157 --> 04:40:11,098
Have you been quarry checked?

2888
04:40:12,680 --> 04:40:13,200
Have you passed?

2889
04:40:14,161 --> 04:40:14,461
OK.

2890
04:40:15,382 --> 04:40:15,802
He speaks.

2891
04:40:17,744 --> 04:40:17,985
No.

2892
04:40:18,965 --> 04:40:20,126
The question becomes this.

2893
04:40:21,268 --> 04:40:22,288
He's running the program.

2894
04:40:22,329 --> 04:40:23,189
He's quarry checked.

2895
04:40:23,650 --> 04:40:23,730
OK.

2896
04:40:26,633 --> 04:40:28,134
cities and towns, they don't have this.

2897
04:40:28,674 --> 04:40:39,398
And the question that it boils down to, if in fact, as the superintendent alluded to, these are unsupervised contact with students.

2898
04:40:40,238 --> 04:40:46,520
Counselor Farquhar, you mentioned the question when we were doing the LED lights for the Andrews School.

2899
04:40:46,640 --> 04:40:51,322
I think the comment was that the second shift of the people in the building, they will be

2900
04:40:54,112 --> 04:41:03,618
So if we're going to follow this train of thought, maybe you or the council should get a notice that who the people were, and were they query checked, and did they pass.

2901
04:41:03,819 --> 04:41:05,660
Just making the comment is one thing.

2902
04:41:06,380 --> 04:41:08,502
And the superintendent is absolutely right.

2903
04:41:09,082 --> 04:41:13,365
You guys up here tonight, you shouldn't even be here because you haven't been query checked.

2904
04:41:13,745 --> 04:41:14,946
This is public access.

2905
04:41:15,006 --> 04:41:17,388
This is a Medford City Council meeting.

2906
04:41:17,408 --> 04:41:18,508
It's public access.

2907
04:41:18,548 --> 04:41:19,549
The people can see it.

2908
04:41:19,789 --> 04:41:23,312
They can come in and they can talk the same way you can too.

2909
04:41:24,481 --> 04:41:26,722
So you've got to follow the same rules.

2910
04:41:27,543 --> 04:41:32,285
You, in essence, are producing your own show, which is the Memphis City Council.

2911
04:41:33,166 --> 04:41:47,274
Now when you talk about, I think it's section, I believe it's number five, it says here that the producer acknowledges that there's a possibility that the producer will have direct and unsupervised contact with children.

2912
04:41:47,374 --> 04:41:49,375
Okay, we'll give you a grant to that.

2913
04:41:50,468 --> 04:41:58,977
But if I never walk into this building and I send you something through the mail to have it played, are you going to play it without having the car rechecked?

2914
04:42:01,919 --> 04:42:02,560
Can you answer that?

2915
04:42:02,580 --> 04:42:05,423
If you can't answer it, just say yes or no.

2916
04:42:06,004 --> 04:42:06,624
I can't answer it.

2917
04:42:06,664 --> 04:42:09,147
I would have to go back to the city and ask.

2918
04:42:10,382 --> 04:42:12,103
And that's where the problem begins.

2919
04:42:12,343 --> 04:42:13,704
You have to go back to the city.

2920
04:42:14,064 --> 04:42:18,626
Here's the gentleman who's the manager of the station, and these questions should be all readily available.

2921
04:42:18,966 --> 04:42:23,468
You know, there are things on here that talk about what can and cannot be played.

2922
04:42:23,808 --> 04:42:35,053
It talks about, in section 4D, materials that contain bias, motivated threats, intimidation, and coercion that interfere with a person's civil rights.

2923
04:42:36,287 --> 04:42:42,811
Well, I can attest to the fact that I was a product of the former, Channel 3.

2924
04:42:42,851 --> 04:42:45,212
They did all of those things to me.

2925
04:42:46,092 --> 04:42:48,914
And now they're putting it in here, and I'm glad to see that it's in here.

2926
04:42:49,274 --> 04:42:52,696
Because there's a civil rights section in here for the violation of any of those things.

2927
04:42:53,196 --> 04:43:02,762
And there's also a section here as it relates to what can and cannot be shown, as it relates to obscenities and without getting into the graphics of each and every one of the words.

2928
04:43:03,797 --> 04:43:14,786
There I think you might have an issue as it relates to constitutional rights as to when and how it can be spoken and what time of the program, morning, noon, and night, it can be played.

2929
04:43:15,547 --> 04:43:24,895
There's also a section here regarding you or anyone who's listening or anyone in this audience who decides to become a producer by giving something.

2930
04:43:29,027 --> 04:43:36,952
If you give them something and they lose it, they destroy it or what have you, they're not responsible unless it was gross negligence on their part.

2931
04:43:37,712 --> 04:43:48,718
But if you were to borrow something from Channel 3 and there was something wrong and some damage took place, you would be culpably liable financially and otherwise.

2932
04:43:49,498 --> 04:43:50,839
That's what this agreement says, Mr. Bennett.

2933
04:43:57,623 --> 04:44:08,109
I really think what you really need to ask is, there are some people who might want to just come in and say, there's a community section in here on cable television.

2934
04:44:08,429 --> 04:44:16,614
They may want to come in, I don't know what the terminology might be, they may want to show a birthday party, or they may want to show a wedding, or whatever it may be, just a one-shot deal.

2935
04:44:17,595 --> 04:44:22,558
And for that one-shot deal, and coming in that entrance over there, not coming in the non-school hours,

2936
04:44:23,255 --> 04:44:27,419
You're telling that person, call them a producer, that they have to get a Corby check.

2937
04:44:28,299 --> 04:44:29,520
A cousin of mine, you're absolutely right.

2938
04:44:29,921 --> 04:44:31,742
You really need to know the genesis behind this.

2939
04:44:31,782 --> 04:44:33,844
No city in town around this has this.

2940
04:44:34,885 --> 04:44:35,606
This is crazy.

2941
04:44:36,386 --> 04:44:39,609
This is not making any sense at all, is to go through this.

2942
04:44:39,649 --> 04:44:41,891
This is going to really stifle free speech.

2943
04:44:42,071 --> 04:44:44,493
This is going to stifle your election coming up right now.

2944
04:44:45,732 --> 04:44:53,666
for reelection and any new candidate running, is you're going to have to get a corporate check to walk into that room, submit a tape, whatever it might be.

2945
04:44:54,227 --> 04:44:55,148
Now you think about it.

2946
04:44:56,170 --> 04:44:57,512
You've served all these years.

2947
04:44:59,019 --> 04:45:03,262
And now you have to submit a quarterly check to get into your local public access channel.

2948
04:45:03,983 --> 04:45:05,063
It makes no sense at all.

2949
04:45:05,764 --> 04:45:08,366
To me, I think it's an administrative discrimination point.

2950
04:45:09,246 --> 04:45:11,748
I don't think the administration has the right to do this.

2951
04:45:12,469 --> 04:45:16,311
I think the city solicitor needs to come and present his argument before you.

2952
04:45:17,392 --> 04:45:21,035
And the only person that can change this, the only person that can change this,

2953
04:45:30,554 --> 04:45:40,101
you are on public access right now, and you guys and gals are producers because you're making this show, you're producing your comments, you're producing your votes.

2954
04:45:40,941 --> 04:45:49,147
But to get over on that other side of the room and to be there and have your voice heard as an announcement, you'd have to become a producer, you'd have to come and get a Corby check.

2955
04:45:49,587 --> 04:45:53,870
And that'll stifle free speech and free access in the city of Medford.

2956
04:45:54,671 --> 04:45:55,011
Thank you.

2957
04:45:56,172 --> 04:45:56,552
Thank you.

2958
04:45:58,513 --> 04:45:59,134
Move approval.

2959
04:46:00,667 --> 04:46:01,948
Name and address of the record, please.

2960
04:46:02,168 --> 04:46:07,373
Hey, my name is Joe Villione, 59 Garfield Ave, and I just rushed here from band practice.

2961
04:46:07,933 --> 04:46:08,934
We play once a year.

2962
04:46:09,735 --> 04:46:13,017
Inside this phone's one of the best bands in New England, my band.

2963
04:46:13,438 --> 04:46:18,262
And the key here is this, more than the Corey check, which is

2964
04:46:24,838 --> 04:46:26,981
I've been in access television since 1979.

2965
04:46:27,622 --> 04:46:30,365
In America, I'm one of the oldest producers.

2966
04:46:30,746 --> 04:46:31,907
I produce over in Somerville.

2967
04:46:32,027 --> 04:46:33,629
Ben Brown has five of my shows.

2968
04:46:34,030 --> 04:46:40,118
So he played Steve Katz's formality, great show, but he's Heming and Haring about playing my show, and it's like,

2969
04:46:41,309 --> 04:46:44,575
You know, I've got Gilbert Gottfried on, and Ray Manzarek at the doors.

2970
04:46:44,615 --> 04:46:46,939
You want me to go down to the thousands of people I've had on?

2971
04:46:46,959 --> 04:46:50,485
You know, tomorrow I've got Gentle Giant, a band that opened for Jethro Tull.

2972
04:46:50,885 --> 04:46:53,570
Last week I had Jethro Tull's Martin Barron.

2973
04:46:53,910 --> 04:46:54,772
So, I'm a fan.

2974
04:46:56,615 --> 04:46:58,036
But I do community work.

2975
04:46:58,577 --> 04:47:19,316
So my great community work for the Kitty Connection, which I do a lot of work for Marie, and I'm going to continue to, is stifled not only by the Corey check, but there's another element to that contract which threatens to sue you if, oh, someone thinks you've intimidated a witness, and God knows I prevailed in court over that when someone fraudulently sued me.

2976
04:47:20,985 --> 04:47:22,586
You know, that's the kind of thing that can happen.

2977
04:47:22,626 --> 04:47:29,831
So if you do a show and someone doesn't like that, you say, oh, I saw the city council president skip out on a vote to pay the part, which I did.

2978
04:47:30,532 --> 04:47:37,217
If you say that on TV, the city council president could probably sue me because he doesn't like what I said, but he'd be wrong in doing that.

2979
04:47:37,237 --> 04:47:38,078
It's my free speech.

2980
04:47:38,558 --> 04:47:40,439
So then you have to pay for your attorney.

2981
04:47:40,779 --> 04:47:45,283
And in the contract, you must pay for the city hall's attorney if my reading is correct.

2982
04:47:45,783 --> 04:47:47,043
What planet are we on?

2983
04:47:47,384 --> 04:47:51,165
I'm one of the oldest producers in the history of friggin' public access.

2984
04:47:51,605 --> 04:47:52,885
Pardon my friggin' French.

2985
04:47:53,506 --> 04:47:59,948
And I've seen many a producer's indemnification agreement, and this is wholesale censorship.

2986
04:48:00,328 --> 04:48:06,250
And may I quote the city solicitor, I would find the city squelching free speech.

2987
04:48:07,094 --> 04:48:07,674
Repugnant.

2988
04:48:08,615 --> 04:48:10,776
Mr. Rumley, you're the author of censorship.

2989
04:48:10,796 --> 04:48:12,037
What are you talking about?

2990
04:48:12,837 --> 04:48:15,319
Now, I believe in public access.

2991
04:48:15,719 --> 04:48:21,422
So if a grandma wants to do a cooking show, you insult her by cory-checking her.

2992
04:48:21,462 --> 04:48:22,203
Who's she going to hurt?

2993
04:48:22,483 --> 04:48:22,963
Number one.

2994
04:48:23,544 --> 04:48:34,190
Number two, to have a grandma sign this thing, and if someone's just deciding they're going to be a bully, and they don't like her grandson or her husband, and they sue her,

2995
04:48:35,140 --> 04:48:49,750
That poor family has to go through what I've gone through, paying thousands of dollars in legal bills, because I've fought for public access harder than any person in Medford for the past 15 years, and the 600 grand we have came because I kept the fight alive.

2996
04:48:50,251 --> 04:48:56,755
And then a city councilor came in, and Doreen Wade came in, and we brought down TV3, and that's why the 600 grand.

2997
04:48:57,036 --> 04:48:59,197
You want to talk about someone who's really upset?

2998
04:48:59,537 --> 04:49:02,820
Because I've given a quarter of my life to Medford.

2999
04:49:04,426 --> 04:49:06,667
And I've given thousands of dollars in legal bills.

3000
04:49:06,727 --> 04:49:07,228
And I win.

3001
04:49:07,288 --> 04:49:11,050
I won against the TV station manager in Superior Court.

3002
04:49:11,390 --> 04:49:13,411
I got a restraining order on the next manager.

3003
04:49:13,851 --> 04:49:18,154
And if I have to file restraining orders on the mayor and the new manager, so be it.

3004
04:49:18,554 --> 04:49:19,955
My show has to be played.

3005
04:49:20,035 --> 04:49:21,076
You have my show.

3006
04:49:21,696 --> 04:49:22,757
I've done nothing wrong.

3007
04:49:22,857 --> 04:49:23,877
I'm a good human being.

3008
04:49:24,157 --> 04:49:25,078
How dare you?

3009
04:49:25,498 --> 04:49:28,240
How dare you not play my show in this city?

3010
04:49:29,323 --> 04:49:40,730
My God, I have sweat blood for public access TV, and I will not be intimidated and bullied and dragged into court by people who aren't even fit to shine my shoes.

3011
04:49:42,511 --> 04:49:44,412
And I will see them in court in another venue.

3012
04:49:44,933 --> 04:49:46,994
Now, I want the access, I want it now.

3013
04:49:47,574 --> 04:49:51,637
The candidates running for office are being denied.

3014
04:49:52,617 --> 04:49:54,899
They were denied the primary election.

3015
04:49:54,919 --> 04:49:58,201
So all the incumbents came in, including Mrs. Cuno,

3016
04:49:59,759 --> 04:50:03,901
But the people that don't get the traction did not get it.

3017
04:50:04,841 --> 04:50:11,885
While I've been fighting day after day after day to get public access in this city, I will not stand for it.

3018
04:50:12,345 --> 04:50:15,567
And if I had to sue a smirking De La Ruzo, I will sue him.

3019
04:50:16,547 --> 04:50:18,048
I'm tired, I'm fed up.

3020
04:50:19,000 --> 04:50:21,702
You, Mr. De La Russo, said we need a young man to do access.

3021
04:50:21,762 --> 04:50:24,244
No, Mr. De La Russo, I'm the authority here.

3022
04:50:24,804 --> 04:50:25,865
You know about undertaking.

3023
04:50:25,965 --> 04:50:27,186
I know about public access.

3024
04:50:27,666 --> 04:50:28,487
I am the authority.

3025
04:50:28,787 --> 04:50:34,891
We need an older person that knows public access, that knows the rules, and that wants to facilitate programming.

3026
04:50:34,911 --> 04:50:35,632
That's his job.

3027
04:50:36,332 --> 04:50:38,054
Outreach is his job.

3028
04:50:38,374 --> 04:50:42,977
And that contract, that indemnification agreement, is the antithesis of outreach.

3029
04:50:43,978 --> 04:50:46,700
I just played in one of the best rock and roll bands in Boston.

3030
04:50:47,798 --> 04:50:49,179
just now, and I have to come over here.

3031
04:50:49,239 --> 04:50:50,300
Johnny Byers called me.

3032
04:50:50,561 --> 04:50:52,983
That poor kid wants to put his sports show on the air.

3033
04:50:53,003 --> 04:50:53,984
We are denying him now.

3034
04:50:54,704 --> 04:50:57,307
Anyone who subscribes to this is denying him now.

3035
04:50:59,569 --> 04:51:00,970
This has to end.

3036
04:51:01,150 --> 04:51:02,051
It has to end now.

3037
04:51:02,151 --> 04:51:05,694
And if I have to file an injunction, so help me God, I will.

3038
04:51:07,116 --> 04:51:08,257
I'm pretty good in the courtroom.

3039
04:51:10,120 --> 04:51:12,322
as someone here knows very well.

3040
04:51:13,322 --> 04:51:17,886
And I will not stand for this and the smirking and the censorship at this very city council.

3041
04:51:18,166 --> 04:51:19,627
So let's have access to TV.

3042
04:51:20,047 --> 04:51:22,729
If Ben Brown can't answer the questions, he should just quit.

3043
04:51:23,369 --> 04:51:26,672
He couldn't tell me how a Verizon contract works.

3044
04:51:27,092 --> 04:51:29,354
So I sent him to Hingham and I sent him Malden.

3045
04:51:29,674 --> 04:51:31,475
I'm only music director over in

3046
04:51:32,916 --> 04:51:38,959
I'm Malden's live on tape, and I'm music director over at Boston Free Radio, and I do my show in Somerville.

3047
04:51:38,979 --> 04:51:43,900
So why should I be denied a show when I do it in Somerville, when I have six memberships?

3048
04:51:44,241 --> 04:51:51,684
When you could learn so much from me, young man, you could learn so much from me, but you'd rather take the blood money and censor us.

3049
04:51:52,144 --> 04:51:53,444
So that's what I have to say tonight.

3050
04:51:54,325 --> 04:51:56,566
You want to know about AXS TV, give me a call.

3051
04:51:56,626 --> 04:51:57,306
You know where I am.

3052
04:51:58,076 --> 04:52:05,342
We're going to have access to TV, we're not going to have censorship, and Stephanie Burt will be held accountable if this nonsense continues.

3053
04:52:06,202 --> 04:52:07,764
So help me God.

3054
04:52:08,344 --> 04:52:10,586
Mr. President, a couple of questions for the gentleman at the podium.

3055
04:52:10,646 --> 04:52:15,650
It sounds like, based upon the presentation, that you haven't signed the producer in indemnification form.

3056
04:52:16,650 --> 04:52:17,131
Is that correct?

3057
04:52:17,331 --> 04:52:17,471
Yep.

3058
04:52:18,232 --> 04:52:22,175
And if you did, you'd be subjecting yourself to a Corey check, is that correct?

3059
04:52:22,980 --> 04:52:24,542
Well, the Cori check, who cares?

3060
04:52:24,642 --> 04:52:28,687
What I'm more concerned about, sir... Just bear with me for a minute.

3061
04:52:28,707 --> 04:52:30,069
City Hall has my Cori, come on.

3062
04:52:30,109 --> 04:52:31,651
Just bear with me for a second, sir.

3063
04:52:32,913 --> 04:52:36,657
You'd have to take a Cori check if you signed up for the producer identification form, right?

3064
04:52:36,677 --> 04:52:36,858
Who cares?

3065
04:52:36,938 --> 04:52:37,759
It's not a big deal.

3066
04:52:37,799 --> 04:52:38,620
Can you pass the Cori check?

3067
04:52:40,308 --> 04:52:40,908
Of course I can.

3068
04:52:40,989 --> 04:52:42,770
You can't pass the Cori Check.

3069
04:52:42,830 --> 04:52:44,371
Unlike you, Mr. Knight, I think I can.

3070
04:52:44,551 --> 04:52:45,252
I'm worried about you.

3071
04:52:45,272 --> 04:52:46,253
I'm not worried about you.

3072
04:52:46,293 --> 04:52:47,134
I'm concerned about you.

3073
04:52:47,334 --> 04:52:48,855
I actually worked for the school department for a couple of years.

3074
04:52:48,875 --> 04:52:49,255
I know you do.

3075
04:52:49,275 --> 04:52:50,136
I think that you should be.

3076
04:52:50,176 --> 04:52:51,157
I've actually passed the Cori Check.

3077
04:52:51,177 --> 04:52:55,981
I think, you know, when people put signs against bus stops, people should be held accountable.

3078
04:52:56,361 --> 04:52:57,982
You break the rules, I play by the rules.

3079
04:52:58,062 --> 04:52:58,703
Exactly.

3080
04:52:58,723 --> 04:53:01,785
And I want to thank Councilor Brianna Longo-Curran for putting this on the thing.

3081
04:53:01,806 --> 04:53:05,749
But the thing that concerns me is not the Cori Check and you trying to embarrass people all the time.

3082
04:53:05,769 --> 04:53:06,930
Mr. President, I do believe I have the floor.

3083
04:53:06,950 --> 04:53:08,151
You ignorant person.

3084
04:53:08,171 --> 04:53:09,332
I do believe I have the floor, Mr. President.

3085
04:53:10,112 --> 04:53:11,795
Councilor Night has the floor, Mr. Miglione.

3086
04:53:12,135 --> 04:53:12,296
Hmm?

3087
04:53:12,776 --> 04:53:14,839
Councilor Night has the floor at the particular moment.

3088
04:53:15,320 --> 04:53:16,481
Was he congratulating someone?

3089
04:53:17,002 --> 04:53:17,743
Or did someone die?

3090
04:53:17,763 --> 04:53:20,367
I'm congratulating you on your excellent presentation this evening.

3091
04:53:20,407 --> 04:53:22,470
I do appreciate you coming out here this evening.

3092
04:53:22,550 --> 04:53:23,832
It's been very enlightening.

3093
04:53:23,892 --> 04:53:24,453
What are they called?

3094
04:53:25,671 --> 04:53:30,472
We're called Love and Flame, and we were one of Boston's five best bands in Playboy magazine, 1978.

3095
04:53:30,732 --> 04:53:32,153
That's a good year.

3096
04:53:32,173 --> 04:53:34,133
That's the year I was born.

3097
04:53:34,153 --> 04:53:35,154
That's the year I was born.

3098
04:53:35,974 --> 04:53:42,536
Well, I know a little bit more about dancing on stage, too, so I think I gave a pretty good performance here tonight, after I sang all Lou Reed's songs on my own.

3099
04:53:42,596 --> 04:53:43,876
Sounds like you had a good night.

3100
04:53:43,916 --> 04:53:44,556
Congratulations.

3101
04:53:44,596 --> 04:53:44,916
I really do.

3102
04:53:44,956 --> 04:53:46,597
The band is unbelievable.

3103
04:53:46,617 --> 04:53:46,957
Thank you.

3104
04:53:46,977 --> 04:53:50,958
It's nice of you to come up here and put that aside, to come up here and share with us, so I do appreciate that, Mr.

3105
04:53:51,178 --> 04:53:54,142
You know, I wish I could teach you how to talk in a mic, too, Ms.

3106
04:53:54,382 --> 04:53:54,983
Lindahl.

3107
04:53:55,083 --> 04:53:56,205
You talk way too fast.

3108
04:53:56,265 --> 04:53:57,286
You have to articulate.

3109
04:53:58,925 --> 04:54:04,689
Mr. President, this is bringing me to my point, Mr. President.

3110
04:54:04,989 --> 04:54:07,091
I fail to see how this is helping move Medford forward.

3111
04:54:07,951 --> 04:54:13,275
I'll move Medford forward with Kitty Connection and with all the personality stuff I do with people on the street.

3112
04:54:13,395 --> 04:54:14,356
I want to help the city.

3113
04:54:14,836 --> 04:54:15,677
I want to help the city.

3114
04:54:15,957 --> 04:54:17,038
I don't congratulate people.

3115
04:54:17,078 --> 04:54:18,138
I work hard for people.

3116
04:54:18,419 --> 04:54:18,779
Keep it up.

3117
04:54:19,339 --> 04:54:20,660
I congratulate you for your hard work.

3118
04:54:20,680 --> 04:54:24,843
But the thing that worries me is not the quarry check as much as the legal aspect of that.

3119
04:54:25,423 --> 04:54:27,325
That is the thing that worries me, Mr. Knight.

3120
04:54:27,845 --> 04:54:29,505
The quarry check, City Hall has my quarry.

3121
04:54:29,646 --> 04:54:30,266
Who's getting home?

3122
04:54:30,766 --> 04:54:31,326
I don't know.

3123
04:54:31,386 --> 04:54:32,386
I was just asking a question.

3124
04:54:32,626 --> 04:54:33,647
I was in court with someone.

3125
04:54:33,747 --> 04:54:34,327
Of course they do.

3126
04:54:34,727 --> 04:54:35,927
But that doesn't worry me.

3127
04:54:35,947 --> 04:54:38,088
What worries me, what concerns me is more lawsuits.

3128
04:54:38,788 --> 04:54:41,429
Because you shouldn't go to Access and be sued like TV3 did.

3129
04:54:41,509 --> 04:54:43,189
And that's what Mrs. Burke is setting up here.

3130
04:54:43,889 --> 04:54:44,410
And it's wrong.

3131
04:54:44,690 --> 04:54:49,151
And I'm trying to facilitate programming for 60,000 people in Medford, and I want to help the candidates out.

3132
04:54:49,591 --> 04:54:54,072
Mr. McKillip, Cheryl Rodriguez, Ray Scarfo, they all deserve Access TV.

3133
04:54:54,172 --> 04:54:57,013
Without this hassle, the quarry thing is kind of like a stumbling block.

3134
04:55:00,095 --> 04:55:03,478
I don't find it to be scary either, that's why I was just trying to get a little bit more clarity.

3135
04:55:03,498 --> 04:55:06,680
You and I aren't scared, but Mr. Knight, I've got one question for you.

3136
04:55:07,321 --> 04:55:13,425
If you and I aren't scared, is it possible that the other 60,000 people might be scared by a court of change?

3137
04:55:13,645 --> 04:55:14,246
I really don't know.

3138
04:55:14,646 --> 04:55:16,147
I can't speak for 60,000 people.

3139
04:55:16,227 --> 04:55:19,730
I've been doing outreach for people, and I think it would scare them.

3140
04:55:20,050 --> 04:55:23,133
It doesn't scare me or you, but it would scare the community, and that's not right.

3141
04:55:23,173 --> 04:55:31,061
It doesn't sound very scary to me, but I do appreciate Councilman Longocare bringing this matter forward, and I do appreciate Mr. Brown for being up here this evening as well, because I think he did a great presentation.

3142
04:55:31,681 --> 04:55:33,223
So thank you very much, Mr. McMahon.

3143
04:55:34,384 --> 04:55:35,545
Name and address of the record, please.

3144
04:55:37,126 --> 04:55:38,548
David McKillop, 94 Rockland Road.

3145
04:55:47,851 --> 04:55:56,053
Basically, I had a couple of conversations with Ben Brown, and a couple of really great conversations.

3146
04:55:57,073 --> 04:56:02,775
I believe that Ben has a long road ahead of him in the respect of trying to get TV3 up and running.

3147
04:56:02,895 --> 04:56:07,656
I agree with him in one respect, that there should be some modicum

3148
04:56:09,797 --> 04:56:13,400
independence from the city, although it can't be completely.

3149
04:56:13,420 --> 04:56:21,184
It should be a non-profit organization with a board of directors and I believe hopefully someday we'll get there and that will help in that respect.

3150
04:56:21,605 --> 04:56:31,231
As far as the Corey check goes, the conversations that Ben and I had, because I believe all candidates, both incumbent and ones that are running for positions,

3151
04:56:31,953 --> 04:56:36,754
are very excited about the opportunity of Medford Media.

3152
04:56:37,214 --> 04:56:38,655
Am I saying it correct, Ben?

3153
04:56:38,675 --> 04:56:39,315
Medford Media.

3154
04:56:40,655 --> 04:56:44,116
I think everybody should be excited about it, as well as the community itself.

3155
04:56:44,796 --> 04:56:50,178
However, when I had those conversations, what I was asking Ben is, how do we get involved in it?

3156
04:56:50,258 --> 04:56:51,858
How do we get to be a part of it?

3157
04:56:52,158 --> 04:56:57,840
The first conversation was based off of this contract that City Solicitor Rumley had

3158
04:56:59,140 --> 04:57:03,222
Ben did call me and tell me that he finally got it in his hands, whatever that time frame was.

3159
04:57:03,262 --> 04:57:11,565
And then in the next question I asked, quite specifically, how can candidates get involved now that we have some leeway?

3160
04:57:12,265 --> 04:57:18,728
And the first response was, my plan is, Dave, to try to get all the candidates to submit

3161
04:57:22,529 --> 04:57:31,453
of a film stating what they would like to project for their candidacy, and that way there he could air it the first two weeks in October.

3162
04:57:31,533 --> 04:57:34,254
My first question was, my God, that's so many candidates.

3163
04:57:34,354 --> 04:57:37,495
Are you going to be able to pull this off starting the end of this week, hopefully?

3164
04:57:38,710 --> 04:57:52,956
And then my next question was specifically, well, what happens, and I'm sorry if I throw you under the bus, Counselor Marks, but what happens if Michael Marks asks, how do I get myself on TV and do a call-in show or something like that?

3165
04:57:53,976 --> 04:57:57,998
And there was a little hemming and hawing because he wasn't quite sure of the answer as of that point.

3166
04:57:58,698 --> 04:58:01,340
Nowhere in that conversation did it state a Cori check.

3167
04:58:01,400 --> 04:58:11,046
I think everybody here, if I'm wrong, please correct me, but I think that everybody knows that a Cori check takes some time, not 24 hours, maybe not even a week.

3168
04:58:12,607 --> 04:58:13,388
24 hours for sure?

3169
04:58:13,408 --> 04:58:17,410
Okay, so then I stand corrected.

3170
04:58:17,430 --> 04:58:18,471
So again, I apologize.

3171
04:58:18,831 --> 04:58:23,794
But that would be, you know, the first step is to get that out of the way and get everybody up and running because...

3172
04:58:25,673 --> 04:58:34,281
If you are going to submit a copy, and we all have to be quarried on that, and we're not even in the building, that doesn't make any sense to me.

3173
04:58:34,301 --> 04:58:37,003
But if we are coming into the building, and it is a one-shot deal.

3174
04:58:37,063 --> 04:58:42,428
I don't see candidates coming in once a week to start a show.

3175
04:58:42,508 --> 04:58:43,969
I just think it's a one-shot deal.

3176
04:58:44,009 --> 04:58:49,094
They want to come in, and they want to present their case in the respect of how they'd like to see Medford move forward.

3177
04:58:50,926 --> 04:58:52,888
I think that Medford has to be better than this.

3178
04:58:53,108 --> 04:58:59,816
I think that this hemming and hawing about Medford media has got to stop.

3179
04:58:59,956 --> 04:59:01,617
I mean, let's just move it forward now.

3180
04:59:01,998 --> 04:59:06,403
Let's stop this constant trying to find a way to

3181
04:59:06,983 --> 04:59:11,944
figure out how it's going to delay the process a little bit longer, a little bit longer, a little bit longer.

3182
04:59:11,984 --> 04:59:14,145
I think we have somebody that really wants to move it forward.

3183
04:59:14,505 --> 04:59:17,646
His vision seems, in my mind, to be a progressive vision.

3184
04:59:18,286 --> 04:59:21,366
He believes that the technology has to come to a different level.

3185
04:59:21,626 --> 04:59:22,487
There's a lot of work to do.

3186
04:59:22,527 --> 04:59:25,967
But in the same respect, it's got to be launched, and it's got to be launched now.

3187
04:59:26,087 --> 04:59:27,148
And I think it's time.

3188
04:59:27,508 --> 04:59:33,869
And I think all of the, including the mayor, would probably want to see everyone be able to use this.

3189
04:59:33,969 --> 04:59:36,550
And I would ask Mayor Stephanie Burke to

3190
04:59:37,290 --> 04:59:43,033
make a comment that she can't wait to see us all get on here as well because that's really what this is about.

3191
04:59:43,213 --> 04:59:57,861
I think everybody should be able to use this and be able to show the people in Medford that may not be able to come to different events and different venues that want to sit at home or can't do anything but sit at home but want to listen and want to learn.

3192
04:59:57,881 --> 05:00:00,042
And one of the things that surprised me more than anything else

3193
05:00:00,742 --> 05:00:10,246
And Ben can attest to this is how fascinating the fact that Medford residents love to watch this media.

3194
05:00:10,486 --> 05:00:12,127
They absolutely love watching it.

3195
05:00:12,507 --> 05:00:13,468
So it is viable.

3196
05:00:13,568 --> 05:00:14,828
It's incredibly important.

3197
05:00:15,168 --> 05:00:16,249
It needs to move forward.

3198
05:00:16,549 --> 05:00:17,750
It needs to move forward now.

3199
05:00:18,130 --> 05:00:22,071
So now that we've got the contracts and anybody that wants to get involved, let's get this ball rolling.

3200
05:00:22,312 --> 05:00:23,192
That's really all I can say.

3201
05:00:29,115 --> 05:00:30,416
Name and address of the record, please.

3202
05:00:30,436 --> 05:00:37,079
Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 4th Street.

3203
05:00:41,240 --> 05:00:42,901
So I'm not afraid of my Cori check.

3204
05:00:42,981 --> 05:00:43,782
I get it every year.

3205
05:00:45,032 --> 05:00:53,202
a very active volunteer at the Roberts Elementary School, and I'm fortunate enough to be a stay-at-home mom and able to go into the school during the school day to submit my CORI.

3206
05:00:53,762 --> 05:01:00,310
My husband, Alex, works outside the home, and he usually has to work from home or something if he wants to get his CORI.

3207
05:01:01,333 --> 05:01:03,435
because it's only offered during the school hours.

3208
05:01:03,455 --> 05:01:06,817
So I'm concerned about possibly hours that people will be able to do quarries.

3209
05:01:06,897 --> 05:01:10,220
I'm not sure if everyone knows that you do have to submit a quarry in person.

3210
05:01:10,620 --> 05:01:13,082
You have to show a physical copy of your ID.

3211
05:01:13,782 --> 05:01:19,126
So if we wanna make sure that this is accessible, there needs to be multiple hours.

3212
05:01:19,667 --> 05:01:30,435
I'm not sure why if you're not coming in the building, you would need one, but just logistically speaking, it can be difficult for people to do the quarries in person if there are not evening hours, weekend hours, things like that.

3213
05:01:31,346 --> 05:01:31,546
Thanks.

3214
05:01:35,269 --> 05:01:40,332
President, let me just make a couple quick comments on CORI so everyone understands how CORIs work, okay?

3215
05:01:41,032 --> 05:01:43,174
First of all, a CORI check is very quick.

3216
05:01:43,194 --> 05:01:46,436
You fill out the paperwork, you bring in your material.

3217
05:01:46,516 --> 05:01:53,160
Obviously, identification is required to ensure that you are actually the person who is being CORI checked.

3218
05:01:53,860 --> 05:01:55,381
That's just a safeguard.

3219
05:01:55,842 --> 05:01:57,783
You get it back in about 24 hours or less.

3220
05:01:58,923 --> 05:02:00,384
It's that quick, right?

3221
05:02:00,724 --> 05:02:13,113
Now, if you're denied employment or volunteer status on a Cori check, what happens is you then can be told why you're denied, and you have a right to appeal it.

3222
05:02:14,354 --> 05:02:16,696
Now, I can't share a Cori.

3223
05:02:16,756 --> 05:02:22,160
If I get a Cori, and I'm the person who reviews Coris in the school department, I can't share that Cori with anybody.

3224
05:02:22,180 --> 05:02:24,121
I have to look at it.

3225
05:02:24,742 --> 05:02:25,562
I'll give you an example.

3226
05:02:28,489 --> 05:02:31,451
insurance violation, failure to register your car.

3227
05:02:31,471 --> 05:02:33,533
There's a lot of those things that show up.

3228
05:02:33,573 --> 05:02:42,239
Those things are not terribly important to me unless, in fact, you're driving a bus or you're doing something that might be related to the particular offense.

3229
05:02:42,319 --> 05:02:44,701
Obviously, substances, things of that type.

3230
05:02:45,281 --> 05:02:51,485
And when it happened, how it happened, did it happen last week, last year, or did it happen 20 years ago when you were a kid?

3231
05:02:51,505 --> 05:02:53,347
I mean, those things are different.

3232
05:02:53,607 --> 05:02:54,888
Obviously, you look at those things.

3233
05:02:55,268 --> 05:02:56,289
But let's say you're denied.

3234
05:02:57,089 --> 05:02:58,869
You have a right to get your Cori checked.

3235
05:02:59,509 --> 05:03:01,590
You have a right to make it public yourself.

3236
05:03:02,110 --> 05:03:07,491
And if you're denied for something stupid or something you think is discriminatory, you can make that public.

3237
05:03:08,251 --> 05:03:09,411
I can't, but you can.

3238
05:03:10,212 --> 05:03:16,133
So any issuing authority has to keep it quiet, has to look at it that way.

3239
05:03:16,173 --> 05:03:24,835
But an individual who's affected by it has every right to protest that, in fact, their Cori was denied for some superficial reason.

3240
05:03:25,455 --> 05:03:26,455
So it's important to know that.

3241
05:03:27,315 --> 05:03:33,459
So you can't discriminate just simply because, you know, I don't like you because you're a person who says things that I don't like.

3242
05:03:34,239 --> 05:03:38,242
It has to be a substantive reason or a person has a right to appeal it.

3243
05:03:39,002 --> 05:03:42,704
And oftentimes, people come in and they say, you know, that happened so many years ago.

3244
05:03:43,605 --> 05:03:45,366
I've been this way for so many times.

3245
05:03:45,406 --> 05:03:46,387
Can you give me a chance?

3246
05:03:47,207 --> 05:03:47,687
That happens.

3247
05:03:48,728 --> 05:03:50,989
So I just want you to understand how that process works.

3248
05:03:51,530 --> 05:03:55,432
Now, within the school system, everybody has to be fingerprinted as well.

3249
05:03:55,452 --> 05:03:56,453
It's an FBI check.

3250
05:03:58,082 --> 05:04:00,623
Not volunteers, but people who are employees.

3251
05:04:00,983 --> 05:04:01,323
Think of it.

3252
05:04:02,383 --> 05:04:06,805
So there's a whole series of things that have to go on in our world.

3253
05:04:06,885 --> 05:04:09,446
So it's the nature of society today.

3254
05:04:09,806 --> 05:04:11,567
People are very concerned about safety.

3255
05:04:11,607 --> 05:04:15,688
They're very concerned about who's there, who's in contact with their young people.

3256
05:04:16,328 --> 05:04:17,529
And there's a lot of steps involved.

3257
05:04:17,549 --> 05:04:24,051
But you do have a right to protest an adverse decision on your car for each other.

3258
05:04:25,291 --> 05:04:25,611
Thank you.

3259
05:04:26,192 --> 05:04:26,692
To the chair.

3260
05:04:27,778 --> 05:04:29,379
Thank you, President Carviello.

3261
05:04:29,759 --> 05:04:30,359
I know it's late.

3262
05:04:30,579 --> 05:04:32,540
If we could just get an update.

3263
05:04:32,620 --> 05:04:36,382
I want to thank Ben for being here and answering questions, as well as the superintendent.

3264
05:04:37,703 --> 05:04:47,007
If we could just get an update with regards to outreach to the public to let people know that there is a process in place, how they can apply.

3265
05:04:47,027 --> 05:04:49,228
A lot of people don't really know about this.

3266
05:04:49,268 --> 05:04:50,809
We've kind of bring it to light tonight.

3267
05:04:52,118 --> 05:04:58,527
Obviously there was word that there might be a candidates clip that you're going to accept, so obviously reach out to the candidates.

3268
05:04:58,627 --> 05:05:06,418
But with regards to the general public, if they want to become a member, if they want to do a show, want to put a tape in, what type of outreach will you be doing?

3269
05:05:06,458 --> 05:05:07,359
Will there be a reverse 911 call?

3270
05:05:08,933 --> 05:05:25,566
So as far as the open house goes, we're going to invite the delegation from the school committee and the city council, as well as the mayor's office and other people that we can get off of lists from around the community.

3271
05:05:27,929 --> 05:05:32,373
After that, we'll hold several nights for different groups of people.

3272
05:05:32,453 --> 05:05:34,595
We'll hold a night for nonprofit organizations.

3273
05:05:34,635 --> 05:05:48,886
We'll hold a, you know, just meet and greet nights where I do plan on working with the Arts Council as well as the Chamber of Commerce to try to get the word out there as much as I can.

3274
05:05:50,207 --> 05:05:56,732
And yeah, my hope is that that will generate enough organic

3275
05:05:59,303 --> 05:06:17,698
I just, as a resolve, I'd just like to see if we could put out a reverse 9-1-1 call before the open house and let people know that applications can be submitted either at the open house or in person any time and with the hours of operation of TV3 so we can get this up and running and help Ben with his endeavour.

3276
05:06:19,880 --> 05:06:20,340
Thank you.

3277
05:06:21,261 --> 05:06:24,444
On the motion by Councillor Lingo-Kern, name and address of the record, please.

3278
05:06:34,439 --> 05:06:39,382
election, we'll have to have a query check or not, because you just said you're going to invite them in over there.

3279
05:06:39,942 --> 05:06:44,865
That's going to be required of a candidate running for office incumbent newcomer.

3280
05:06:47,306 --> 05:06:49,387
Uh, yes, I believe it will.

3281
05:06:51,068 --> 05:06:56,611
So tonight we had you folks up here with your public access and we have right down

3282
05:07:06,082 --> 05:07:10,444
And this is where the situation is going to become really sticky and technical.

3283
05:07:11,184 --> 05:07:12,124
Why did Corby check?

3284
05:07:12,144 --> 05:07:13,945
No other city in town around this has it.

3285
05:07:14,185 --> 05:07:15,465
If you look at their applications.

3286
05:07:17,106 --> 05:07:21,807
Now, you guys in Bureau, you're candidates as well as candidates for re-election.

3287
05:07:21,827 --> 05:07:23,828
You're all going to have to have a Corby check.

3288
05:07:25,289 --> 05:07:27,169
And I disagree with you for 24 hours.

3289
05:07:28,430 --> 05:07:29,050
For the time being.

3290
05:07:30,611 --> 05:07:30,971
Thank you.

3291
05:07:31,071 --> 05:07:34,352
On the motion by Councilor Locario, seconded by Councilor Falco.

3292
05:07:35,698 --> 05:07:36,358
All those in favor?

3293
05:07:37,999 --> 05:07:38,519
All those in favor?

3294
05:07:38,539 --> 05:07:38,620
Aye.

3295
05:07:38,660 --> 05:07:39,960
Motion passes.

3296
05:07:40,400 --> 05:07:48,265
If I can move a suspension of the rules to take 17-648, I'm going to table my last four since it's almost midnight.

3297
05:07:48,285 --> 05:07:49,305
17-648.

3298
05:07:52,407 --> 05:07:55,208
Petitions, presentations, and civil matters.

3299
05:07:55,228 --> 05:07:55,428
17-648.

3300
05:07:55,849 --> 05:08:04,193
Petition by Andrew P. Casagnetti, 23 Cushing Street, Memphis, to address the council to ask a question.

3301
05:08:06,381 --> 05:08:07,137
Mr. Cassidy.

3302
05:08:48,698 --> 05:08:54,001
I just want to re-ask a question that I brought forward to the council at the last meeting.

3303
05:08:55,542 --> 05:09:03,287
And that was simply, for a council, councilor I ask to bring forward the question.

3304
05:09:03,307 --> 05:09:05,168
I don't have that power or authority.

3305
05:09:07,029 --> 05:09:14,614
To ask the mayor, why isn't new growth, brand new real estate tax used to offset

3306
05:09:24,393 --> 05:09:33,774
I just wanted to know, was that question actually sent to the mayor?

3307
05:09:34,334 --> 05:09:36,455
Mr. Clerk, the minutes haven't been adopted.

3308
05:09:37,175 --> 05:09:37,675
I do not know.

3309
05:09:37,955 --> 05:09:39,575
The minutes haven't been adopted from the last meeting.

3310
05:09:40,436 --> 05:09:42,116
Until we get official minutes, we don't know.

3311
05:09:42,136 --> 05:09:47,177
That's right, the minutes were not adopted from the last meeting, so that question would not have gone to the mayor.

3312
05:09:49,142 --> 05:09:50,926
After tonight, when the minutes get adopted, it should.

3313
05:09:50,946 --> 05:09:53,031
Because the minutes weren't adopted.

3314
05:09:53,051 --> 05:09:55,656
Hopefully, they will be adopted.

3315
05:09:58,749 --> 05:10:00,149
is indeed inside the minutes.

3316
05:10:00,450 --> 05:10:02,011
They are, it is inside those minutes.

3317
05:10:02,071 --> 05:10:03,532
Are you sure of that, Councilor?

3318
05:10:03,552 --> 05:10:08,435
I would hope so, if the clerk, Clerk Finn does a very good job with his records.

3319
05:10:09,336 --> 05:10:19,262
If it's not, I'm sure, uh, uh, Councilor Longo-Kern will, I think she, uh, Councilor Longo-Kern is reviewing it right as we speak.

3320
05:10:20,583 --> 05:10:21,544
Thank you very much.

3321
05:10:21,564 --> 05:10:23,345
You have another question, Mr. Castaneda?

3322
05:10:27,567 --> 05:10:46,660
I just wanted to make, I actually wanted to say, Honorable Councilors, while I have this moment, I would like a minute to congratulate all of the seven city councilors and the seven council challengers.

3323
05:10:47,520 --> 05:10:54,065
I wish you all good luck, and more importantly, good health before and after seven of the 14

3324
05:10:58,096 --> 05:11:05,898
Also, I'd like to give a Hapu thanks to my 499 people who voted for me.

3325
05:11:07,058 --> 05:11:13,400
And also to all the other voters, thank you, too, because if you didn't, you'd fail.

3326
05:11:15,260 --> 05:11:17,281
Because now I'm in a real good place.

3327
05:11:17,301 --> 05:11:19,461
The pressure is off.

3328
05:11:20,421 --> 05:11:22,702
And I don't have to look down at all the Republicans.

3329
05:11:23,542 --> 05:11:23,982
Thank God.

3330
05:11:25,723 --> 05:11:26,823
And now here's the best part.

3331
05:11:28,678 --> 05:11:41,488
Now Andrew can go back to my roots in Michigan, hoping that people may connect to a better place and may connect to affordable again for some.

3332
05:11:43,349 --> 05:11:51,675
Also, I'm hoping you all will assist me with my five key priorities.

3333
05:11:52,256 --> 05:11:55,078
That is, number one, improve public safety.

3334
05:12:06,159 --> 05:12:09,062
or promote responsible development.

3335
05:12:10,163 --> 05:12:25,960
And my baby, number five, recluse real estate taxable for unoccupied homeowners by adoption of full 35% under Massachusetts federal law, under 59 section 5C, as it's done in formidable,

3336
05:12:34,595 --> 05:12:38,281
Finally, provide some bond over tax relief for homeowners.

3337
05:12:39,263 --> 05:12:42,128
And now I have a sixth mission.

3338
05:12:44,732 --> 05:12:45,975
Promote public access.

3339
05:13:05,568 --> 05:13:08,470
Thank you for your attention, assistance, and public spirit.

3340
05:13:08,490 --> 05:13:11,572
Now back to my question.

3341
05:13:13,374 --> 05:13:15,315
Was the question in the records, Councilor?

3342
05:13:15,335 --> 05:13:15,856
Yes, it was.

3343
05:13:15,876 --> 05:13:17,837
Thank you very much for listening.

3344
05:13:18,057 --> 05:13:19,558
It is 17607, Mr. Kessinger.

3345
05:13:20,779 --> 05:13:21,200
Thank you.

3346
05:13:21,460 --> 05:13:28,585
Mr. President, while we're on to suspension, I've been asked to make the following announcement by the leaders of the community.

3347
05:13:32,979 --> 05:13:43,887
There are a series of public forums coming up for surveys and input into the community preservation process.

3348
05:13:45,169 --> 05:13:56,558
The committee forums will be on Wednesday evening, October 4th, 2017 from 7 to 9 at the Medford High School Library.

3349
05:13:57,519 --> 05:13:59,440
And Saturday morning, October 14th,

3350
05:14:00,783 --> 05:14:06,729
from 11 to 12 at the Medford Senior Center, 101 Riverside Avenue.

3351
05:14:07,369 --> 05:14:15,477
And to take the survey, and for further information, go to www.preservemedford.org.

3352
05:14:16,358 --> 05:14:17,179
Thank you, Councilor Donovan.

3353
05:14:17,199 --> 05:14:18,160
Thank you, Mr. President.

3354
05:14:18,180 --> 05:14:18,160
17644.

3355
05:14:18,200 --> 05:14:19,181
Motion to table my next four.

3356
05:14:22,105 --> 05:14:24,707
Motion by Council Member Kern and the table 17-644, 17-645, 17-646, and 17-647.

3357
05:14:24,747 --> 05:14:26,628
Do we have anything else here?

3358
05:14:26,688 --> 05:14:27,189
Records.

3359
05:14:27,369 --> 05:14:28,349
The records.

3360
05:14:28,369 --> 05:14:30,891
The records were of August.

3361
05:14:30,911 --> 05:14:36,495
Mr. President, I'd like to be heard for a moment.

3362
05:14:36,515 --> 05:14:39,137
I've been here all night.

3363
05:14:52,184 --> 05:14:59,407
I've been here all night, and three motions on the agenda tonight, I stayed to answer them, and they just got tabled.

3364
05:15:00,007 --> 05:15:07,330
So I'd like to be given the courtesy of making a couple of comments if I can, because I've issued you a couple of reports that the school committee received.

3365
05:15:08,950 --> 05:15:12,172
Maybe some people don't want to hear the facts, but nevertheless, here they are.

3366
05:15:12,372 --> 05:15:16,513
No, Mr. Superintendent, you gave them to us at 10 o'clock for us to review.

3367
05:15:17,114 --> 05:15:18,014
Why 10 o'clock?

3368
05:15:20,180 --> 05:15:23,142
We got the, I saw you give them to Larry, the answers at 10 o'clock.

3369
05:15:23,322 --> 05:15:23,802
That's okay.

3370
05:15:23,822 --> 05:15:26,484
And I have an opportunity to review them before my own resolution.

3371
05:15:26,724 --> 05:15:27,304
That's okay.

3372
05:15:27,865 --> 05:15:29,866
You have any, your resolution was on the agenda.

3373
05:15:29,926 --> 05:15:31,066
I came here and stayed here.

3374
05:15:31,187 --> 05:15:33,168
But if you were here all night, why didn't you give them to us at 4 or 7?

3375
05:15:34,008 --> 05:15:37,670
Because I gave it to you when I thought you were busy with another.

3376
05:15:38,091 --> 05:15:39,071
I'm not going to trade with her.

3377
05:15:39,572 --> 05:15:42,553
But I'd like a moment as a citizen to be able to address the council.

3378
05:15:43,174 --> 05:15:43,794
We would love it.

3379
05:15:43,974 --> 05:15:48,597
Uh, Councilor Laguna has pulled those motions, but you are free to address the council.

3380
05:15:49,700 --> 05:15:50,100
Thank you.

3381
05:15:51,160 --> 05:15:52,300
Just want to say something.

3382
05:15:52,320 --> 05:15:54,581
There are three reports on the agenda tonight.

3383
05:15:54,981 --> 05:16:01,442
The school committee received these reports last night, or received the update last night.

3384
05:16:02,582 --> 05:16:03,162
Let him speak.

3385
05:16:04,103 --> 05:16:09,343
Are we in public participation, or are we in suspending the rules?

3386
05:16:09,964 --> 05:16:16,205
Motion to suspend the rules by Councilor Del Rosso, seconded by Councilor Falco, I mean by Councilor Scott Pelley.

3387
05:16:17,085 --> 05:16:17,645
All those in favor?

3388
05:16:21,149 --> 05:16:21,770
of the Council.

3389
05:16:23,391 --> 05:16:35,544
Tonight, on the agenda, there are items that dealt with enrollment in real estate development and the impact upon class size, the impact upon enrollment in the schools.

3390
05:16:36,140 --> 05:16:40,402
And I think it's important that you hear this and you are aware of it.

3391
05:16:40,582 --> 05:16:41,843
I gave you reports tonight.

3392
05:16:42,563 --> 05:16:44,745
One report was done at the beginning of the school year.

3393
05:16:45,545 --> 05:16:51,628
The second report was done this week and given to the school committee and they had a discussion on it last night.

3394
05:16:52,489 --> 05:16:57,932
And I think it's important that you know this because there are some things flying around the community that are just patently not true.

3395
05:16:58,787 --> 05:17:06,213
And I think it's important that you know it, so that when you're asked these questions in public, you can answer them truthfully, and you have the statistics in front of you.

3396
05:17:07,414 --> 05:17:12,598
I'm going to refer to the report that was given last night, because I think that's the most relevant one right now.

3397
05:17:13,679 --> 05:17:21,045
It talks about the impact of real estate development on class size, class enrollment in the Metro Public Schools.

3398
05:17:22,766 --> 05:17:24,888
And we picked eight

3399
05:17:25,617 --> 05:17:41,077
units or eight different developments in the city with 150 or more units in it and looked at the class size impact, looked at the impact of student enrollment by school, by grade.

3400
05:17:44,090 --> 05:17:48,493
by different development to give you an idea of what the impact is.

3401
05:17:49,074 --> 05:17:56,519
And if you read it closely, you'll find that there's 105 students in eight developments that come to our public schools, 105.

3402
05:17:58,321 --> 05:17:59,882
Two of them are in outside placements.

3403
05:18:02,564 --> 05:18:03,985
Two of them are in outside placements.

3404
05:18:04,865 --> 05:18:10,670
And if you spread them out and look at it, the average class size in the elementary schools is 18.3.

3405
05:18:12,868 --> 05:18:14,389
That's the best in the commonwealth.

3406
05:18:14,590 --> 05:18:16,151
Almost the best in the commonwealth.

3407
05:18:16,371 --> 05:18:17,192
You should be proud of that.

3408
05:18:17,252 --> 05:18:18,273
You support the schools.

3409
05:18:18,573 --> 05:18:20,195
The school committee supports the schools.

3410
05:18:20,215 --> 05:18:21,836
You should be proud of that.

3411
05:18:22,477 --> 05:18:23,758
Because you've got good class size.

3412
05:18:23,778 --> 05:18:29,764
Because you've asked the question about class size over and over again at the various meetings that I've attended on budget.

3413
05:18:30,504 --> 05:18:32,766
So I think you should have that as you go into the campaign.

3414
05:18:33,107 --> 05:18:33,988
I think you should know that.

3415
05:18:34,870 --> 05:18:41,278
But there is a rumor going around that somewhere development is overrunning the schools.

3416
05:18:41,319 --> 05:18:42,380
The schools are overwhelmed.

3417
05:18:42,540 --> 05:18:43,521
It's not true.

3418
05:18:44,435 --> 05:18:45,075
It's not true.

3419
05:18:45,156 --> 05:18:46,056
Go over the report.

3420
05:18:46,076 --> 05:18:49,539
I'm not going to go over it with you now because it's late and you can read.

3421
05:18:49,559 --> 05:18:55,263
But I think it's important that you know this as you move around the city and people ask you about development.

3422
05:18:55,924 --> 05:19:03,029
Development is important to support the various initiatives, to reduce the tax rate, to do all the things that you want to do in the community.

3423
05:19:03,730 --> 05:19:09,915
And at the same time, it's a legitimate concern to determine whether or not it's going to cost you more money in your public schools.

3424
05:19:10,375 --> 05:19:12,637
Well, right now, we're doing just fine.

3425
05:19:13,553 --> 05:19:23,682
Right now you could add 155 seats to the elementary schools and still be below 20 students in a class on average.

3426
05:19:23,762 --> 05:19:29,346
You could add 500 seats and still have decent class size at this particular point in time.

3427
05:19:38,930 --> 05:19:41,971
Now there may be some need for some looking at distribution.

3428
05:19:42,672 --> 05:19:44,693
One school maybe has a little bit less than another.

3429
05:19:45,273 --> 05:19:46,473
That's always the case.

3430
05:19:46,513 --> 05:19:47,234
You work on that.

3431
05:19:48,214 --> 05:20:02,280
But you should know as a city council, you should know as the people that help to fund the budget and do development in the city, that your schools have sufficient capacity to handle additional students right now.

3432
05:20:02,861 --> 05:20:03,861
And we can move forward.

3433
05:20:04,381 --> 05:20:05,282
You should also know

3434
05:20:06,464 --> 05:20:08,026
that our schools are doing just fine.

3435
05:20:08,726 --> 05:20:09,687
And you're part of the support.

3436
05:20:09,707 --> 05:20:11,269
There's a lot of great programs going on.

3437
05:20:11,970 --> 05:20:16,895
And then you're here tonight in this auditorium, which has been renovated in many ways.

3438
05:20:17,575 --> 05:20:20,058
You're going to see any number of other additional renovations.

3439
05:20:20,618 --> 05:20:22,620
Last night, the school committee received a report

3440
05:20:23,904 --> 05:20:29,747
on the merger between the high school and the vocational school and the exciting programs that are taking place there.

3441
05:20:30,407 --> 05:20:40,431
And we welcome the opportunity when the new Bistro 49 is there to have you there and to see that and to see how the youngsters use the new resources that you have helped to support.

3442
05:20:41,852 --> 05:20:47,674
Last spring I came to you and I asked you to support the submission of an SOI to the School Building Authority.

3443
05:20:48,575 --> 05:20:51,456
The School Building Authority will be in Medford

3444
05:20:52,413 --> 05:20:58,627
on October 5 to begin their site visit to determine whether or not we can receive funding for that purpose.

3445
05:20:59,438 --> 05:21:06,021
So we can look at that as another possibility of developing our schools, our programs, and moving things forward.

3446
05:21:06,421 --> 05:21:07,762
So a lot of good is going on.

3447
05:21:08,222 --> 05:21:10,043
I welcome the opportunity to share that tonight.

3448
05:21:10,483 --> 05:21:19,667
But I didn't want to miss the opportunity to tell you that the discussion about overwhelmed numbers in the schools are not true.

3449
05:21:19,687 --> 05:21:21,047
It's not true.

3450
05:21:21,248 --> 05:21:21,908
Look at the numbers.

3451
05:21:22,468 --> 05:21:24,309
Happy to answer any questions you have.

3452
05:21:25,401 --> 05:21:33,206
I want you to know that, and just in case you get asked on the street, and when you have to make development decisions, I want you to be fully informed.

3453
05:21:34,106 --> 05:21:35,227
So I appreciate the time.

3454
05:21:35,807 --> 05:21:37,368
Thank you, and have a good night.

3455
05:21:44,312 --> 05:21:47,535
The public know that I am not one to be spreading rumors.

3456
05:21:47,735 --> 05:21:56,002
My point of the resolutions that I'll put forward next week is that we plan and get the answers like we did tonight at 10 p.m.

3457
05:21:56,443 --> 05:22:02,908
I would like to just review them and hopefully I'll be able to thank whoever produced them for us next week.

3458
05:22:03,049 --> 05:22:07,993
But to get something at 10 when you're trying to concentrate on people in the audience, on people at the podium,

3459
05:22:08,533 --> 05:22:10,355
It's a little hard to review what you were given.

3460
05:22:10,375 --> 05:22:12,897
I have not been spreading that rumors.

3461
05:22:12,997 --> 05:22:16,721
I believe two of our schools are close to or at capacity.

3462
05:22:17,061 --> 05:22:21,846
That was proven this year when two classrooms had to be moved from the Roberts to the Brooks.

3463
05:22:22,427 --> 05:22:28,613
All I'm asking for, or I will ask for next week, is just a plan, the numbers, so that we can plan accordingly.

3464
05:22:34,677 --> 05:22:41,480
The table records of the meeting of July 18th, 2017 were passed to Councilor Knight.

3465
05:22:41,620 --> 05:22:42,380
Move the roll, Mr. Councilor.

3466
05:22:42,400 --> 05:22:44,141
Councilor Knight, have you reviewed the records?

3467
05:22:44,261 --> 05:22:44,561
I have.

3468
05:22:44,601 --> 05:22:45,041
Move the roll.

3469
05:22:46,061 --> 05:22:49,703
Motion to accept the records of July 18th.

3470
05:22:50,883 --> 05:22:52,484
Seconded by Councilor Del Rosso.

3471
05:22:54,145 --> 05:22:54,865
All those in favor?

3472
05:22:55,425 --> 05:22:55,545
Aye.

3473
05:22:56,045 --> 05:23:01,808
The records of the meeting of August 15th, 2017 were passed to Councilor Longo Kern.

3474
05:23:03,084 --> 05:23:04,304
How did you find those records?

3475
05:23:04,664 --> 05:23:05,705
I've reviewed the records.

3476
