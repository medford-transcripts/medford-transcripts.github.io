[SPEAKER_15]: And we have a quorum, we can continue.

23
00:00:51,553 --> 00:00:53,493

00:01:10,118 --> 00:01:11,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, Adam Klein.

29
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:12,458
[SPEAKER_15]: That's a new one.

30
00:01:12,498 --> 00:01:13,118
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, you're right.

31
00:01:17,299 --> 00:01:19,840
[SPEAKER_12]: Feel free to unmute and say hello, introduce yourself.

32
00:01:26,147 --> 00:01:27,148
[SPEAKER_15]: Why don't we return to him?

33
00:01:28,688 --> 00:01:29,489
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, is everyone there?

34
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:30,789
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, there you go.

35
00:01:30,809 --> 00:01:32,350
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, I'm Adam Klein.

36
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,871
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm actually the manager down at JRA Cycles.

37
00:01:35,932 --> 00:01:41,635
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got wind of this meeting tonight, so I figured I would hop on as I run the bike shop in town.

38
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:42,755
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

39
00:01:43,856 --> 00:01:44,096
[SPEAKER_12]: Awesome.

40
00:01:44,116 --> 00:01:44,696
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for coming.

41
00:01:45,117 --> 00:01:45,457
[SPEAKER_05]: No worries.

42
00:01:45,477 --> 00:01:46,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

43
00:01:47,098 --> 00:01:51,580
[SPEAKER_12]: I see Anton Rapitov.

44
00:01:53,788 --> 00:01:56,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, so I'm actually from Arlington Bicycle Advisory Committee.

45
00:01:57,311 --> 00:02:08,682
[SPEAKER_07]: We got your email about the repainting of two circles between Arlington and Medford, and so I came here.

46
00:02:09,382 --> 00:02:10,043
[SPEAKER_07]: for this reason.

47
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:15,950
[SPEAKER_07]: We have some explanation of how this happened and what's our thought about it and we can discuss it.

48
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:18,452
[SPEAKER_07]: If it's not the right time I can come to the next meeting.

49
00:02:18,652 --> 00:02:22,056
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry I haven't announced my presence beforehand.

50
00:02:22,697 --> 00:02:27,022
[SPEAKER_07]: I was sick and so it's just basically Thursday when I'm sort of well.

51
00:02:28,183 --> 00:02:28,703
[SPEAKER_12]: No, that's great.

52
00:02:28,743 --> 00:02:29,403
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for coming.

53
00:02:29,804 --> 00:02:34,205
[SPEAKER_15]: We have an infrastructure agenda item scheduled for about 755.

54
00:02:34,646 --> 00:02:39,648
[SPEAKER_15]: If necessary, we could move that forward at the discretion of the chair.

55
00:02:39,668 --> 00:02:42,589
[SPEAKER_15]: I guess I appreciate it.

56
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:45,170
[SPEAKER_07]: I also have two children to put to sleep.

57
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:51,132
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that would be fine to move that up if you have things to do.

58
00:02:51,172 --> 00:02:52,293
[SPEAKER_12]: We would like to hear about that.

59
00:02:52,313 --> 00:02:55,274
[SPEAKER_12]: Louis, looking down the list.

60
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,703
[SPEAKER_12]: Scott Benevitz.

61
00:03:01,666 --> 00:03:05,829
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, hi, my name's Scott Benowitz, just a local Medford resident.

62
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:28,245
[SPEAKER_14]: I've had some conversations around a pump track up at Carver Park with Amanda Centrella up at the city and I reached out to Bruce actually to see about just presenting to this committee, just some of the concepts, just to have discussion around it and maybe help or support from this group in addition to maybe some others to gain some traction and help for it.

63
00:03:30,686 --> 00:03:31,207
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, thank you.

64
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:39,782
[SPEAKER_12]: In that case, do we have a motion to approve the minutes?

65
00:03:39,882 --> 00:03:42,302
[SPEAKER_15]: One more person, someone, Kaitlin.

66
00:03:43,342 --> 00:03:47,463
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, Kaitlin, I forgot that you're not actually a member since you come a lot.

67
00:03:49,444 --> 00:03:50,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

68
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:57,326
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, I'm Kaitlin Robinson and just a Medford resident interested in biking issues.

69
00:03:57,386 --> 00:04:01,787
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was actually reflecting just the other day about like,

70
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:08,931
[SPEAKER_09]: how much it feels to me like I'm seeing more bicycles now compared to like 10 years ago, which has been nice to see.

71
00:04:10,912 --> 00:04:11,413
[SPEAKER_12]: That's great.

72
00:04:11,453 --> 00:04:11,773
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

73
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:13,994
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

74
00:04:14,874 --> 00:04:17,536
[SPEAKER_12]: And there's Dennis.

75
00:04:17,596 --> 00:04:20,357
[SPEAKER_12]: Rebecca Wright just showed up, so add her to the roll.

76
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,441
[SPEAKER_12]: And did I miss anyone else?

77
00:04:27,861 --> 00:04:29,122
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there anyone else on the list?

78
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:31,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Dennis McDougal?

79
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:35,279
[SPEAKER_12]: He works for the city.

80
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:36,340
[SPEAKER_12]: He doesn't count as a guest.

81
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,961
[SPEAKER_12]: He's welcome, but he doesn't count as a guest.

82
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:42,062
[SPEAKER_12]: Cool.

83
00:04:42,622 --> 00:04:44,223
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

84
00:04:44,563 --> 00:04:48,645
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any questions about the minutes from the August meeting, which was actually

85
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:50,983
[SPEAKER_12]: in the beginning of September.

86
00:04:51,003 --> 00:04:58,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I just had one question about the, um, so we, we discussed the Medford bike master plan and I, I didn't see an action item there.

87
00:04:58,388 --> 00:05:00,409
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought we had, we're going to follow up.

88
00:05:00,429 --> 00:05:03,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone was going to follow up with the city where things left off.

89
00:05:03,251 --> 00:05:04,672
[SPEAKER_04]: And I couldn't remember, but I didn't see it in there.

90
00:05:04,692 --> 00:05:06,713
[SPEAKER_04]: So I thought maybe we should put it in there to follow up on.

91
00:05:07,314 --> 00:05:11,657
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a part of the eight o'clock review of goals, priorities, and procedures master plan.

92
00:05:11,997 --> 00:05:13,318
[SPEAKER_15]: Uh, we can discuss it at that point.

93
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:21,634
[SPEAKER_12]: There were a couple of things that Daniel was going to follow up on too, and he's not here.

94
00:05:23,816 --> 00:05:27,518
[SPEAKER_12]: And I don't think he sent an update about those things.

95
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,920
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll come to that when we get there.

96
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,142
[SPEAKER_12]: Were there other questions about the minutes?

97
00:05:35,884 --> 00:05:36,644
[SPEAKER_00]: Move to approve.

98
00:05:38,565 --> 00:05:39,366
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a second?

99
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:41,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Second.

100
00:05:43,028 --> 00:05:43,749
[SPEAKER_12]: All in favor?

101
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:44,789
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

102
00:05:44,809 --> 00:05:44,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Aye.

103
00:05:46,582 --> 00:05:47,182
[SPEAKER_12]: All opposed?

104
00:05:50,203 --> 00:05:51,663
[SPEAKER_12]: And the minutes are approved.

105
00:05:51,763 --> 00:05:52,204
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

106
00:05:53,924 --> 00:05:55,144
[SPEAKER_12]: Next up, announcements.

107
00:05:58,225 --> 00:06:00,406
[SPEAKER_12]: Does anyone have announcements to start off with?

108
00:06:02,466 --> 00:06:05,307
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just pulling up what I've got.

109
00:06:10,048 --> 00:06:15,750
[SPEAKER_12]: If there aren't other announcements, there is the Harvest Your Energy Festival that's coming up.

110
00:06:16,495 --> 00:06:17,815
[SPEAKER_15]: We have that under events 735.

111
00:06:18,195 --> 00:06:18,975
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

112
00:06:18,995 --> 00:06:19,376
[SPEAKER_12]: We have that.

113
00:06:19,736 --> 00:06:20,016
[SPEAKER_12]: You're right.

114
00:06:20,156 --> 00:06:21,556
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

115
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:22,216
[SPEAKER_12]: I missed that.

116
00:06:24,116 --> 00:06:28,017
[SPEAKER_12]: I think anything I would have said for announcements would have been under events anyway.

117
00:06:28,117 --> 00:06:37,659
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm going to suggest that we move up the discussion of the two circles between Arlington and Medford since Anton is here to tell us about that.

118
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:41,340
[SPEAKER_12]: We had some concerns about that the last meeting.

119
00:06:43,280 --> 00:07:02,136
[SPEAKER_12]: and in particular that it doesn't do much to facilitate movements just going straight through or to indicate what bicyclists should do or to indicate that bicyclists should be in the middle of the lane if they want to go straight through so that you can go straight through and not get right hooked.

120
00:07:03,997 --> 00:07:06,898
[SPEAKER_12]: But Anton, do you want to tell us more?

121
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:07,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

122
00:07:07,538 --> 00:07:09,239
[SPEAKER_07]: So we do agree this.

123
00:07:10,499 --> 00:07:15,201
[SPEAKER_07]: So the current painting doesn't really help when you go through.

124
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:21,623
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do actually travel on my bike each day when I go to my work.

125
00:07:21,763 --> 00:07:27,505
[SPEAKER_07]: I go to Winchester Centre train station by bike from Arlington Centre.

126
00:07:27,545 --> 00:07:30,586
[SPEAKER_07]: So I go through and then turn left in Medford.

127
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:35,589
[SPEAKER_07]: So, and what I do is I merge earlier and go like I'm a car.

128
00:07:35,869 --> 00:07:38,171
[SPEAKER_07]: And there is no indication that it's okay.

129
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:43,414
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if you are a proficient cyclist, you would know and you, but yeah.

130
00:07:43,574 --> 00:07:46,837
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but it's not, it wasn't DPW, right?

131
00:07:46,877 --> 00:07:49,859
[SPEAKER_07]: It's neither Arlington DPW nor Metro DPW.

132
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:53,321
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a state, MSDOT, I believe, who did the painting.

133
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:54,522
[SPEAKER_07]: They did

134
00:07:54,742 --> 00:08:01,587
[SPEAKER_07]: send, as far as we know, they did send Arlington, and I guess Medford as well, their planning.

135
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:06,311
[SPEAKER_07]: And then our DPW didn't tell us that this is going to happen.

136
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:10,294
[SPEAKER_07]: And in the planning, it wasn't even clear how it's going to be done.

137
00:08:10,974 --> 00:08:15,277
[SPEAKER_07]: So I guess, yeah, so that's the issue.

138
00:08:17,595 --> 00:08:36,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Thought is that we want to ask MSDOT to put a shadow on the road, like in the circles themselves and before the circles to indicate that it's okay for a bicycle to be on where the cars are.

139
00:08:37,739 --> 00:08:42,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Like probably shadow there and a bicycle in this actual bicycle lane if you turn right.

140
00:08:44,269 --> 00:08:46,911
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll try to go through our DPW.

141
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:51,353
[SPEAKER_07]: If you go through your DPW, it probably would also help.

142
00:08:52,654 --> 00:08:53,575
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, this is a crack.

143
00:08:53,595 --> 00:08:57,077
[SPEAKER_07]: So our thoughts is to ask to put a shadow.

144
00:08:57,297 --> 00:08:59,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Also are the same is within three years.

145
00:08:59,618 --> 00:09:05,041
[SPEAKER_07]: They're going to redesign these two circles anyway, and that should go through public meetings.

146
00:09:05,562 --> 00:09:08,243
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's when we can go and talk.

147
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:10,785
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done.

148
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:13,458
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, thank you so much for that.

149
00:09:13,498 --> 00:09:26,027
[SPEAKER_12]: We kind of had the same conclusion that we would like to see sharrows at the very least, since that doesn't require reconfiguring or removing anything that's already painted.

150
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:27,788
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a relatively simple thing to add.

151
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:40,077
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it would be most effective if it comes from both our commission and also from yours.

152
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:48,704
[SPEAKER_12]: We did, I think we did ask, last meeting we did tell Daniel to write to MassDOT.

153
00:09:49,145 --> 00:09:49,945
[SPEAKER_12]: Or was that Daniel?

154
00:09:50,346 --> 00:09:53,789
[SPEAKER_12]: We said somebody was going to write to MassDOT to that effect.

155
00:09:54,129 --> 00:09:54,750
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that correct?

156
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:57,032
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I don't have the minutes.

157
00:09:57,312 --> 00:09:59,033
[SPEAKER_15]: I can bring it up and confirm if you want.

158
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,448
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I'm pretty sure we did that.

159
00:10:03,488 --> 00:10:04,429
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe it's worth checking.

160
00:10:04,469 --> 00:10:09,593
[SPEAKER_12]: And if it's not in there, then we'll... He definitely sent a draft email.

161
00:10:10,253 --> 00:10:10,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

162
00:10:10,853 --> 00:10:13,415
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have a draft email, I guess it would help us.

163
00:10:13,716 --> 00:10:23,103
[SPEAKER_07]: And do you think it would make sense for us to agree where we think they should put shadows or it should be enough to just ask them?

164
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:25,945
[SPEAKER_12]: That's a good question.

165
00:10:27,306 --> 00:10:28,047
[SPEAKER_15]: What was that question?

166
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:33,803
[SPEAKER_12]: Should we specify exactly where they should put the shares or should we just ask them to put some?

167
00:10:33,823 --> 00:10:37,085
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we could specify, but that's just me.

168
00:10:37,385 --> 00:10:37,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

169
00:10:38,026 --> 00:10:41,068
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think we could at least suggest where they put them.

170
00:10:41,088 --> 00:10:52,855
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, if we're already sending them a letter, might as well give them as much info as we think they need and they can use it or ignore it, I suppose.

171
00:10:53,616 --> 00:10:53,856
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

172
00:10:54,396 --> 00:10:57,999
[SPEAKER_00]: Looks like the email Daniel sent went to DCR.

173
00:10:59,198 --> 00:11:02,920
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're confident it is, in fact, a MassDOT project, we might want to redirect.

174
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:03,580
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure.

175
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:04,480
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be DCR.

176
00:11:04,821 --> 00:11:07,842
[SPEAKER_07]: So DCR is probably more likely.

177
00:11:07,862 --> 00:11:09,082
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I'm sorry.

178
00:11:09,323 --> 00:11:10,383
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just wrong.

179
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,604
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably.

180
00:11:13,004 --> 00:11:14,485
[SPEAKER_07]: DCR, yeah, not MassDOT.

181
00:11:14,505 --> 00:11:19,087
[SPEAKER_00]: So he did send that on September 5th with a copy to the commission.

182
00:11:19,147 --> 00:11:20,628
[SPEAKER_00]: He included some photos.

183
00:11:21,476 --> 00:11:30,684
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so if they already sent, should we just also duplicate it?

184
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:32,186
[SPEAKER_07]: So who is Daniel?

185
00:11:32,646 --> 00:11:36,189
[SPEAKER_07]: Is he part of Bicycle Advisory?

186
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:37,070
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of order.

187
00:11:37,751 --> 00:11:41,194
[SPEAKER_15]: You had requested who was authorized, and I did get the minutes.

188
00:11:41,334 --> 00:11:43,416
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, Daniel was authorized to write to DCR.

189
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:44,096
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

190
00:11:44,116 --> 00:11:44,637
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, thank you.

191
00:11:45,097 --> 00:11:45,358
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

192
00:11:45,798 --> 00:11:47,720
[SPEAKER_12]: Daniel is the chair, but he's not here tonight.

193
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:51,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so he's Bicycle Advisory Committee, not DPW.

194
00:11:52,221 --> 00:11:52,981
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, right.

195
00:11:54,002 --> 00:11:55,162
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, okay, sure.

196
00:11:55,602 --> 00:11:59,263
[SPEAKER_07]: We can definitely send this Arlington Bicycle Advisory Committee.

197
00:12:00,183 --> 00:12:05,365
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as I remember, we thought that would have more weight if we asked our DPW to do it as well.

198
00:12:07,973 --> 00:12:16,795
[SPEAKER_07]: We just lost our liaison to DPW because she went to private sector and we haven't hired anyone.

199
00:12:17,275 --> 00:12:21,636
[SPEAKER_07]: So my take.

200
00:12:22,497 --> 00:12:23,837
[SPEAKER_07]: He was really good though.

201
00:12:23,857 --> 00:12:25,277
[SPEAKER_07]: It's such a pain.

202
00:12:25,957 --> 00:12:27,518
[SPEAKER_01]: Ernie?

203
00:12:28,238 --> 00:12:36,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would like to see that if there are separate proposals from Arlington and Medford and how the sharrows are in place,

204
00:12:37,654 --> 00:12:45,457
[SPEAKER_01]: that that be coordinated and also a review of the final plan before work is actually done.

205
00:12:45,477 --> 00:13:01,983
[SPEAKER_01]: I would hate to see that there are two different sets of logics or even painting visual options to be in place for the rotaries.

206
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:09,047
[SPEAKER_01]: entrance and exit from each direction should be homogenized and logical.

207
00:13:10,028 --> 00:13:10,348
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

208
00:13:10,568 --> 00:13:17,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree that we should have, and it would be better if we had the same logic and that they should be using.

209
00:13:18,731 --> 00:13:22,512
[SPEAKER_07]: So our next meeting would be in October.

210
00:13:23,573 --> 00:13:28,174
[SPEAKER_07]: I think third Wednesday of October is a back meeting.

211
00:13:31,065 --> 00:13:35,929
[SPEAKER_07]: I think if we, yeah, I think we would, like, how would we coordinate better?

212
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,151
[SPEAKER_12]: I see Chris's hand up.

213
00:13:39,712 --> 00:13:53,302
[SPEAKER_12]: My suggestion for you, just before I get to Chris, my suggestion for you is that you can either, if you email us, we can send you the draft text that Daniel used if it's helpful.

214
00:13:54,723 --> 00:14:00,945
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think it's ideal if your letter comes in addition to ours as soon as possible.

215
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:09,847
[SPEAKER_12]: If you can get your DPW to contact them as well, the more the merrier, and that's better.

216
00:14:09,867 --> 00:14:19,869
[SPEAKER_12]: I think Daniel's has already been sent, so if he didn't specify exact locations for Sharrows, then it's too late to put it in that letter unless we want to write another one.

217
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:21,529
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you all

218
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:30,515
[SPEAKER_12]: do the same, I think that would be probably the best we can do.

219
00:14:30,635 --> 00:14:34,579
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you can get your DPW to contact DCR as well, that would be even better.

220
00:14:34,599 --> 00:14:35,840
[SPEAKER_12]: Chris?

221
00:14:41,402 --> 00:14:52,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was just going to say, I mean, is it crazy to ask them to black out some of the paint to create dashed lines, the places where a bike would want to enter into the rotary?

222
00:14:53,328 --> 00:14:57,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that seems like it's almost the biggest challenge, is there's no indication.

223
00:14:57,491 --> 00:15:04,594
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, yeah, OK, bikes can be in there, but there's really no way, even for a bike to understand, because I'm a cyclist, like, where do I cross over?

224
00:15:04,694 --> 00:15:10,678
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really hard to know if there's dashed lines, which it won't be perfect, but you can accomplish that with some black paint.

225
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:14,217
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would push that we propose for that as well.

226
00:15:14,237 --> 00:15:18,346
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're going to be out there painting sharrows, take some black paint and make dashes.

227
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:21,230
[SPEAKER_15]: Bruce?

228
00:15:21,870 --> 00:15:25,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'd like to suggest that we actually get more formal about this.

229
00:15:25,812 --> 00:15:32,534
[SPEAKER_15]: We need somebody to kind of take the lead on giving us a design, whether that be Arlington or whether that be us.

230
00:15:33,714 --> 00:15:38,816
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we review with the other team and come to a consensus on what we want to present.

231
00:15:39,356 --> 00:15:45,278
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think the idea of blacking out the lines is a great one, just so that it's clear that

232
00:15:46,598 --> 00:15:56,682
[SPEAKER_15]: It's perfectly okay and encouraged if you so desire to take the lane and ride the rotary like you normally would, because frankly, that's the only efficient way to get through there.

233
00:15:57,502 --> 00:15:58,743
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

234
00:15:59,063 --> 00:16:03,584
[SPEAKER_15]: So, to that end, I will suggest that we take the lead on that.

235
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:08,002
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not quite sure who can do this in a timely manner.

236
00:16:08,182 --> 00:16:11,784
[SPEAKER_15]: I am going to be traveling for a few days and back on Wednesday.

237
00:16:11,844 --> 00:16:13,165
[SPEAKER_15]: That seems a little bit late.

238
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:20,971
[SPEAKER_15]: So unless somebody else can volunteer to do it on our side, then maybe we should ask Arlington to take the lead.

239
00:16:22,171 --> 00:16:24,813
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess there are two moving parts.

240
00:16:24,993 --> 00:16:30,117
[SPEAKER_12]: One is when we actually send in a drawing of what we think it should look like.

241
00:16:30,257 --> 00:16:33,539
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other is that Arlington

242
00:16:34,777 --> 00:16:41,102
[SPEAKER_12]: has to, they have to meet before they can approve a letter to that effect.

243
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:51,030
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we have a design, I assume their next meeting is going to be before our next meeting, if they meet once a month and we meet once a month, or it's at the same time.

244
00:16:51,050 --> 00:16:51,451
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, it's 15th.

245
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,312
[SPEAKER_07]: Our next meeting is on 15th.

246
00:16:53,352 --> 00:16:54,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so Arlington can send a letter

247
00:16:59,757 --> 00:17:04,420
[SPEAKER_12]: sooner than we can approve some other design.

248
00:17:06,061 --> 00:17:13,425
[SPEAKER_12]: So if it's possible for Arlington to come up with a design and approve it by their meeting, then that would be ideal.

249
00:17:14,045 --> 00:17:19,369
[SPEAKER_12]: If they can't do that, then they can at least submit a letter as of their meeting.

250
00:17:20,564 --> 00:17:28,653
[SPEAKER_12]: And then at that point, they can refer to the fact that we will come back with a diagram as of our next meeting.

251
00:17:29,274 --> 00:17:38,385
[SPEAKER_12]: So then we can approve a diagram a month from now, but they can send another letter in whatever it is, two weeks or whatever.

252
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:40,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Coordination is hard.

253
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,210
[SPEAKER_07]: Can someone of you come to our meeting?

254
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:48,632
[SPEAKER_07]: So at least you can raise concern with our proposed... I might be able to.

255
00:17:49,732 --> 00:17:51,232
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me check my calendar.

256
00:17:51,252 --> 00:17:52,112
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to miss the board time.

257
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:52,533
[SPEAKER_12]: 15th at 7pm.

258
00:17:52,553 --> 00:17:52,593
[SPEAKER_12]: 15, 1-5.

259
00:17:52,953 --> 00:17:53,973
[SPEAKER_07]: It's October 15th, 1-5 at 7pm.

260
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:07,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, what I'm sharing is just like, I mean, I don't know how formal you're thinking, Bruce.

261
00:18:08,904 --> 00:18:10,525
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that looks interesting.

262
00:18:11,226 --> 00:18:12,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd be happy to do something.

263
00:18:13,468 --> 00:18:14,568
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's try those.

264
00:18:18,311 --> 00:18:21,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, this is a good idea to do, but just earlier.

265
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:24,496
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my thought on that.

266
00:18:24,556 --> 00:18:24,996
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, yeah.

267
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:25,937
[SPEAKER_13]: Now I see what you mean.

268
00:18:25,977 --> 00:18:26,858
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, right, right.

269
00:18:27,038 --> 00:18:27,158
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

270
00:18:28,854 --> 00:18:38,681
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so I mean, I'm happy to do something simple like this, take some photos, and then propose some simple sketches of locations for dashed lines and sharrows.

271
00:18:39,502 --> 00:18:48,308
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's something that can be done in a couple few days, at least as a starting point for the two groups to hash out via email.

272
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:54,933
[SPEAKER_04]: If we want to put together something a little bit more formalized to put forward, then maybe somebody else can take it from there.

273
00:18:56,848 --> 00:18:57,309
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, sure.

274
00:18:57,389 --> 00:19:00,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I have shared with you my email.

275
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:09,423
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think you should already know our chair's email, who is Christian.

276
00:19:09,804 --> 00:19:10,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Or do you not?

277
00:19:10,905 --> 00:19:12,107
[SPEAKER_07]: I can share his email.

278
00:19:17,225 --> 00:19:18,786
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, okay.

279
00:19:18,906 --> 00:19:28,029
[SPEAKER_12]: And email address just to read into the record or for anybody watching is, uh, w I L L I R two nine at gmail.com.

280
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:29,510
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that in our chat?

281
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:31,191
[SPEAKER_12]: That's in our chat.

282
00:19:31,431 --> 00:19:31,851
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, good.

283
00:19:31,911 --> 00:19:32,651
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll copy it from there.

284
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:33,011
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

285
00:19:36,173 --> 00:19:37,633
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll send them out.

286
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:39,494
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure.

287
00:19:39,674 --> 00:19:39,954
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

288
00:19:40,034 --> 00:19:41,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Christians email.

289
00:19:44,536 --> 00:19:53,067
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess you can just- And their chair is Christopher Tonkin, and that's t-o-n-k-i-n-c at comcast.net.

290
00:19:55,369 --> 00:19:55,630
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

291
00:19:57,143 --> 00:20:03,952
[SPEAKER_15]: And our Chris, Chris Stivers, was that you that produced that diagram?

292
00:20:04,533 --> 00:20:05,694
[SPEAKER_15]: That very simple sketch?

293
00:20:07,196 --> 00:20:07,837
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

294
00:20:08,097 --> 00:20:11,682
[SPEAKER_15]: And is that something that you're comfortable doing, I mean, from several angles?

295
00:20:11,722 --> 00:20:15,246
[SPEAKER_15]: Because that was pretty quick and easy and better than that.

296
00:20:16,447 --> 00:20:32,720
[SPEAKER_04]: pretty easy panelists to just go out and take photos from different directions so I can get all the streets of relevance and then just do some simple sketches indicating where to start and finish dashed lines and where to place some shadows and at least be a starting point for discussion and then we can review it as our groups.

297
00:20:34,821 --> 00:20:37,603
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that if you and I can work together, I'd be happy to do that.

298
00:20:38,343 --> 00:20:40,885
[SPEAKER_15]: And you can come up with a proposal.

299
00:20:41,005 --> 00:20:51,031
[SPEAKER_15]: We can kind of run it past a few of us, not as an official vote, but just to get ideas and then present it at their next meeting.

300
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:55,233
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, not as something we have definitely approved, but as a starting point.

301
00:20:55,914 --> 00:21:01,037
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we can come back with hopefully an approved version from them.

302
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:14,538
[SPEAKER_15]: maybe perhaps another representative or Anton can come and then we can work out in conference committee, if you will, any changes we need, or hopefully we'll just need to rubber stamp it at that point.

303
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:17,741
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that sounds like a good plan.

304
00:21:18,322 --> 00:21:19,323
[SPEAKER_07]: When is your next meeting?

305
00:21:19,343 --> 00:21:21,865
[SPEAKER_07]: It's October 21st, right?

306
00:21:24,888 --> 00:21:26,630
[SPEAKER_12]: It's whatever the fourth Wednesday is.

307
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, Wednesday, October 22nd.

308
00:21:30,031 --> 00:21:31,191
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sure.

309
00:21:31,671 --> 00:21:38,614
[SPEAKER_07]: I should be able to come online through Zoom.

310
00:21:39,174 --> 00:21:47,497
[SPEAKER_07]: So can I repeat what our current proposal is to make sure I didn't miss it?

311
00:21:50,050 --> 00:22:09,678
[SPEAKER_12]: Our suggestion is that we will attend your meeting and bring a diagram of where we think the sharrows and dotted lines should go, or where this is not approved by us officially, but in the interest of time, a couple of our members will attend your meeting with a picture.

312
00:22:11,018 --> 00:22:18,981
[SPEAKER_12]: And at your meeting, you can choose to adopt it or choose to make changes and vote on it officially.

313
00:22:19,001 --> 00:22:22,362
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can also vote to officially send a letter to DCR.

314
00:22:25,538 --> 00:22:30,741
[SPEAKER_12]: Saying that you want that you want sharrows and the dashed lines like we were talking about.

315
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:44,990
[SPEAKER_12]: And like you mentioned, I can send you the I can send you the text of the draft letter that Daniel wrote on our behalf that was already voted on and sent by our group.

316
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,993
[SPEAKER_12]: But if your group either uses signs on to the same letter or write your own.

317
00:22:50,013 --> 00:22:53,895
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that would be that would be a particularly

318
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:56,081
[SPEAKER_12]: that would be beneficial.

319
00:22:56,161 --> 00:23:03,204
[SPEAKER_12]: And then if you're also able to talk your DPW into contacting them as well, that probably doesn't hurt either.

320
00:23:03,884 --> 00:23:04,184
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.

321
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:11,567
[SPEAKER_15]: So can you... I'd like to make an official motion so we can close down on this because we do need to move on to the car pump track.

322
00:23:12,948 --> 00:23:22,151
[SPEAKER_07]: Quick thing, can you just, once you get the image, can you send it to me and Christian before the meeting so we can look at it?

323
00:23:23,952 --> 00:23:24,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise I'm good.

324
00:23:26,525 --> 00:23:42,477
[SPEAKER_15]: I would like to make the motion that we authorize Bruce and Chris basically to do the verbiage we just talked about, come up with a diagram, get it sent to Arlington, attend the Arlington meeting, at least one of us, and then come back with a proposal that we can vote upon.

325
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:44,619
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

326
00:23:44,739 --> 00:23:45,379
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a second?

327
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:52,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Bruce, I'm likely traveling the 15th, but I can do everything up to that.

328
00:23:52,385 --> 00:23:54,006
[SPEAKER_03]: I can definitely go to the 15th, no problem.

329
00:23:54,206 --> 00:23:55,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I've already checked my calendar.

330
00:23:56,589 --> 00:23:57,169
[SPEAKER_12]: All in favor?

331
00:23:57,189 --> 00:23:57,249
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

332
00:23:58,450 --> 00:23:58,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

333
00:23:59,050 --> 00:23:59,190
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

334
00:24:00,070 --> 00:24:00,370
[SPEAKER_12]: Opposed?

335
00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:04,052
[SPEAKER_12]: And the motion carries.

336
00:24:04,232 --> 00:24:06,452
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Bruce and Chris.

337
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:07,973
[SPEAKER_12]: And thank you, Anton, for coming.

338
00:24:07,993 --> 00:24:08,673
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, thanks.

339
00:24:08,893 --> 00:24:11,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Just in case, I think you need to register to attend our meeting.

340
00:24:12,074 --> 00:24:12,974
[SPEAKER_07]: Pre-register.

341
00:24:13,615 --> 00:24:15,775
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just a Zoom link that's shared.

342
00:24:16,616 --> 00:24:20,177
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's, yeah, some clicks on the website, as I remember.

343
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:21,257
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

344
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,198
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate you taking the time.

345
00:24:23,878 --> 00:24:24,698
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you, too, Anton.

346
00:24:24,758 --> 00:24:25,958
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll see you in a few weeks.

347
00:24:26,458 --> 00:24:27,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, have a good night.

348
00:24:27,739 --> 00:24:27,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

349
00:24:29,899 --> 00:24:32,820
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, next up, the car park pump track.

350
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,160
[SPEAKER_12]: Request and presentation from Scott.

351
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,900
[SPEAKER_12]: Scott, I see you're here, so take it away.

352
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:41,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, just maybe really quick.

353
00:24:43,161 --> 00:24:45,442
[SPEAKER_14]: I've got just a really quick deck to show you.

354
00:24:45,462 --> 00:24:50,102
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, the biggest thing for me is just trying to get some direction.

355
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:52,003
[SPEAKER_14]: I've had very initial conversations with the city.

356
00:24:53,763 --> 00:25:09,517
[SPEAKER_14]: I met with a couple years ago before car park had started I met actually with a landscape architect that was part of the project pitching to what's called a pump track and I'll go through this in just a second but it was going to be part of the car park kind of overall construction projects.

357
00:25:11,078 --> 00:25:18,587
[SPEAKER_14]: And just, you know, I reached out to Bruce, just trying to get help and assistance, especially from an organization that works with the city on the regular.

358
00:25:18,607 --> 00:25:22,792
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm just obviously a local resident who was interested.

359
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:27,638
[SPEAKER_14]: So, let me just share here real quick what I have just pulled together to give you some details.

360
00:25:35,868 --> 00:25:38,109
[SPEAKER_12]: Excuse me, just a sec.

361
00:25:38,409 --> 00:25:42,310
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me make you a co-host if you're not already so that you can screen share.

362
00:25:50,112 --> 00:25:50,692
[SPEAKER_12]: How do I do that?

363
00:25:50,912 --> 00:25:52,052
[SPEAKER_12]: Why is that not showing up?

364
00:25:53,073 --> 00:25:54,993
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to do it.

365
00:25:55,073 --> 00:25:56,194
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll do the host.

366
00:25:56,374 --> 00:26:03,736
[SPEAKER_08]: But he should be able to just screen share because Chris had asked earlier that I just make anybody screen share.

367
00:26:04,436 --> 00:26:04,796
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, good.

368
00:26:04,936 --> 00:26:05,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

369
00:26:16,672 --> 00:26:17,433
[SPEAKER_11]: He's coming back in.

370
00:26:25,384 --> 00:26:26,306
[SPEAKER_14]: I apologize.

371
00:26:26,486 --> 00:26:29,330
[SPEAKER_14]: I was booted out because I think it was saying I couldn't share for some reason.

372
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:31,433
[SPEAKER_14]: So hold just 1 2nd.

373
00:26:48,515 --> 00:26:49,576
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody see this all right?

374
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:50,737
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

375
00:26:51,257 --> 00:26:51,537
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

376
00:26:52,538 --> 00:26:55,240
[SPEAKER_14]: So first off, what's a pump track?

377
00:26:56,547 --> 00:27:08,432
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is a rendering, and I'll have some pictures here in just a second, but really what a pump track is, is a space for people of all ages to ride bikes.

378
00:27:09,152 --> 00:27:15,975
[SPEAKER_14]: And the reason why it's called pump is it's contouring on the ground for you to learn how to maneuver your bike.

379
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:24,058
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's something that's very simple for kids, you know, as young as one to two years old that are on a bike to learn how to maneuver a bike.

380
00:27:24,838 --> 00:27:32,801
[SPEAKER_14]: and they've become really popular over the last, I'd say five to 10 years, not just in mountain biking, but also in BMX.

381
00:27:33,741 --> 00:27:45,446
[SPEAKER_14]: And so there's actually, Adam, who's on the call, he used to race BMXs on the Wakefield BMX pump track back in the day, and it's still there in that facility.

382
00:27:45,686 --> 00:27:49,827
[SPEAKER_14]: And there's also been some that have been built over the last, again, five to 10 years.

383
00:27:49,907 --> 00:27:51,888
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is just a rendering here

384
00:27:52,468 --> 00:27:55,989
[SPEAKER_14]: But here are some examples of different pump tracks.

385
00:27:56,569 --> 00:27:58,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of these are in open air dirt areas.

386
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:00,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of them are built in the woods.

387
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:11,073
[SPEAKER_14]: When we were going through the car park kind of design phase, it was one of the things that had gotten some votes from local residents to have a space for

388
00:28:12,973 --> 00:28:23,758
[SPEAKER_14]: Kids to go ride bikes, the space in the woods in car park has often been not used or honestly, if it has been used in the past, it's been for loitering and partying for kids.

389
00:28:24,378 --> 00:28:33,062
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's actually been, they've done studies to show that pump tracks are actually a great way to cut down on people loitering in the woods and using them for other reasons.

390
00:28:34,763 --> 00:28:37,044
[SPEAKER_14]: So some local ones that are examples.

391
00:28:37,104 --> 00:28:39,565
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Russell Mill here in Chelmsford.

392
00:28:40,145 --> 00:28:50,329
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually right behind a soccer field, kind of similar setup to a car park, and actually goes into a trail network off of the pump track.

393
00:28:50,850 --> 00:28:54,351
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something that's been built over the last 10 to 15 years.

394
00:28:54,851 --> 00:28:58,153
[SPEAKER_14]: And then Acton actually built a pump track that I believe they opened

395
00:28:59,133 --> 00:29:11,896
[SPEAKER_14]: two or three years ago, and then I'm not sure if you're aware, but Arlington just opened Hills Hill, which is a pump track skills area right off of the Minuteman bike path, and was just opened.

396
00:29:11,996 --> 00:29:15,937
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've been talking with Josh Fenalosa, who is an Arlington resident.

397
00:29:15,997 --> 00:29:18,038
[SPEAKER_14]: He was part of the process in pitching that project.

398
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:22,400
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a much bigger scale than what we'd be thinking about doing at Carr Park.

399
00:29:24,041 --> 00:29:29,424
[SPEAKER_14]: So I have some pictures that I can share and pass along to this organization after this as well to show them.

400
00:29:30,365 --> 00:29:31,345
[SPEAKER_14]: Here are some pictures.

401
00:29:31,405 --> 00:29:33,346
[SPEAKER_15]: Point of order, Scott.

402
00:29:33,507 --> 00:29:41,211
[SPEAKER_15]: When you get a chance, could you provide either a link that everybody can use to reference this or a PDF, whatever works best for you?

403
00:29:41,591 --> 00:29:42,271
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, yes.

404
00:29:42,331 --> 00:29:44,873
[SPEAKER_14]: And I've got more documents than just what I have here.

405
00:29:44,893 --> 00:29:49,315
[SPEAKER_15]: If you could pop that into the chat now, that would be great.

406
00:29:49,375 --> 00:29:50,515
[SPEAKER_15]: Otherwise, we'll get to it later.

407
00:29:51,115 --> 00:29:51,796
[SPEAKER_14]: OK, great.

408
00:29:52,696 --> 00:29:55,017
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll do it after I finish the presentation, if that's OK.

409
00:29:55,037 --> 00:29:55,697
[SPEAKER_14]: That's fine.

410
00:29:55,737 --> 00:29:56,058
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

411
00:29:56,718 --> 00:29:59,619
[SPEAKER_14]: And so this is actually the grand opening of Hills Hill in Arlington.

412
00:30:01,852 --> 00:30:10,961
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's like I said, it's a bigger scale than what we'd be talking about with the space we have in Carr Park, but they've already had some really positive turnouts.

413
00:30:11,382 --> 00:30:17,428
[SPEAKER_14]: It's something that kids of all ages are using, adults use as well, but it's a great family space as well.

414
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:22,192
[SPEAKER_14]: So for me, just real quick, I've just gone through what a pump track is.

415
00:30:23,297 --> 00:30:27,399
[SPEAKER_14]: The objective is pretty clear, getting people outside, utilizing the additional space at Carr Park.

416
00:30:27,979 --> 00:30:31,521
[SPEAKER_14]: It's right behind the Disc Golf and Dog Park.

417
00:30:31,641 --> 00:30:39,244
[SPEAKER_14]: If you know where Stowers Ave feeds off of Bell Ave into the park, they actually built a kind of wood chip mulched trail.

418
00:30:39,985 --> 00:30:46,008
[SPEAKER_14]: When I originally walked with the landscape architect that was working on the project, we had found a space kind of in the back

419
00:30:47,008 --> 00:30:53,834
[SPEAKER_14]: up the hill from that that we believe somebody could do some work to build a pump track and it obviously would entail some volunteer work as well.

420
00:30:54,915 --> 00:31:00,420
[SPEAKER_14]: The biggest thing that I'm trying to get is more help with the city or in terms of funding and direction.

421
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:09,567
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd spoken initially with Amanda Centrella a couple of times but I know there's a lot on her plate in regards to the overarching car park plus many other things with the city.

422
00:31:10,208 --> 00:31:13,431
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds like the city is open but they're looking for funding.

423
00:31:15,172 --> 00:31:28,037
[SPEAKER_14]: What I have down here in the bottom is actually the last communication on the car park rehabilitation or the construction was a phase 3 that said something about identifying funding for a pump track, but I'm not, I don't know what the situation is of that.

424
00:31:29,617 --> 00:31:31,778
[SPEAKER_14]: So, but there are some things Adams on the call.

425
00:31:31,838 --> 00:31:41,342
[SPEAKER_14]: I've talked with cycles because there are bike shop in town and 1 of the, I would argue best bike shops around definitely 1 that people travel.

426
00:31:42,002 --> 00:31:43,522
[SPEAKER_14]: throughout the state to come down and visit.

427
00:31:44,243 --> 00:31:47,623
[SPEAKER_14]: And to have something like this would be a really great connection into that as well.

428
00:31:48,004 --> 00:31:52,465
[SPEAKER_14]: They talked about having a fundraiser to help raise some money for it.

429
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:56,626
[SPEAKER_14]: So I've got some more financials and things that I can share from the Hills Hill project.

430
00:31:56,766 --> 00:31:58,226
[SPEAKER_14]: Ours would be obviously scaled down.

431
00:31:58,266 --> 00:32:03,567
[SPEAKER_14]: But again, just looking for this organization maybe with some help or some direction in regards to where to go from here.

432
00:32:07,328 --> 00:32:08,409
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to move that we

433
00:32:10,045 --> 00:32:23,250
[SPEAKER_15]: create a letter of support, perhaps sending it, I guess, going to the mayor might be the right place and identify people who we would want to provide the letter to.

434
00:32:24,512 --> 00:32:27,173
[SPEAKER_14]: One thing too here, Bruce, just to tell you, so this is the picture right here.

435
00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:33,315
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you are familiar with, any of you are familiar with Carr Park, Fulton Street obviously comes over here along this side.

436
00:32:33,815 --> 00:32:34,936
[SPEAKER_14]: This is Winslow here.

437
00:32:35,396 --> 00:32:37,917
[SPEAKER_14]: So the dog park's right here and there's a disc golf right here.

438
00:32:37,977 --> 00:32:43,939
[SPEAKER_14]: This was space that kind of down the hill from up here, there was space here kind of situated for a pump track.

439
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:50,141
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is what had been designated when we had originally talked through this, just for a visual reference.

440
00:32:51,082 --> 00:32:51,642
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, thanks.

441
00:32:53,666 --> 00:32:56,327
[SPEAKER_12]: Bruce has a motion on the table to write a letter of support.

442
00:32:56,367 --> 00:33:00,069
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm wondering if we would have a volunteer to write said letter.

443
00:33:00,089 --> 00:33:04,031
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to necessarily volunteer Daniel, because he's not here.

444
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:07,572
[SPEAKER_12]: But Adam.

445
00:33:07,612 --> 00:33:13,814
[SPEAKER_14]: I was told he's an avid mountain biker, and somebody that Brian at JRA had already told me that I should connect with.

446
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:17,716
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm happy to work with him as well in pulling this together.

447
00:33:17,796 --> 00:33:21,197
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I said, I can get more details, whatever we feel is most helpful.

448
00:33:22,038 --> 00:33:22,578
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure he would.

449
00:33:22,718 --> 00:33:24,139
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I'm sure he would be happy to.

450
00:33:24,199 --> 00:33:27,480
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just I don't want to give him assignments too much when he's not here.

451
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,461
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course.

452
00:33:28,961 --> 00:33:30,722
[SPEAKER_12]: But Adam, any interest?

453
00:33:37,405 --> 00:33:39,847
[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot commit to that.

454
00:33:42,148 --> 00:33:44,209
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't want a letter from me.

455
00:33:44,609 --> 00:33:45,249
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't write well.

456
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:49,832
[SPEAKER_06]: A letter from chat GPT maybe would be better than mine.

457
00:33:51,103 --> 00:33:57,086
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do support the pump track, so don't get me wrong.

458
00:33:57,246 --> 00:34:09,052
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, in that case, then I guess we can, since I know that Daniel is going to be pretty in favor of it, we can tell him to do it.

459
00:34:09,812 --> 00:34:12,434
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm happy to connect with Daniel as well if you want me to.

460
00:34:12,714 --> 00:34:13,894
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can do it too.

461
00:34:16,472 --> 00:34:18,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have time to look at the rest of the presentation?

462
00:34:18,721 --> 00:34:20,628
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would be helpful to see the financials.

463
00:34:22,236 --> 00:34:24,337
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I mean, it's pretty nitty gritty.

464
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:28,297
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not like something that I think would be worthwhile to kind of walk through right now.

465
00:34:28,337 --> 00:34:32,118
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm happy to, like I said, I can drop them in here and go through that.

466
00:34:32,138 --> 00:34:33,519
[SPEAKER_14]: So I can tell you just ballpark.

467
00:34:33,979 --> 00:34:35,339
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, ballpark.

468
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:42,041
[SPEAKER_14]: Hills Hill and Arlington was approximately 400,000 initially proposed.

469
00:34:42,061 --> 00:34:43,261
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not sure where they netted out.

470
00:34:44,441 --> 00:34:49,922
[SPEAKER_14]: But like I said, this is at least a quarter of that, if not maybe smaller.

471
00:34:50,183 --> 00:34:52,003
[SPEAKER_14]: So again, pure ballpark.

472
00:34:53,464 --> 00:35:09,033
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, one question I have on that is whether there's what are the what do the ongoing maintenance costs look like for something like this typically with this, you know, ultimate, what would come down to is it's it'd be volunteer work and that's something that also I'm not sure if.

473
00:35:09,753 --> 00:35:13,076
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm assuming some of you are familiar with NEMBA, the New England Mountain Bike Association.

474
00:35:13,156 --> 00:35:14,557
[SPEAKER_14]: They are familiar with this as well.

475
00:35:15,498 --> 00:35:26,126
[SPEAKER_14]: I have already talked with Adam Glick, who's the president, I believe still the president, and Mary McCarthy, who's the head of the Greater Boston chapter.

476
00:35:26,147 --> 00:35:28,148
[SPEAKER_14]: They are fully in support.

477
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:41,561
[SPEAKER_14]: Trail maintenance and things and volunteer work that we can tap into with that as well as local Medford residents that would probably be willing to put in some time, which is what Acton and Russell Mill do.

478
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:45,465
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really just a matter of getting out with some dirt and doing some contouring over time.

479
00:35:46,346 --> 00:35:50,310
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not a lot of maintenance, but just kind of keeping track of erosion over time.

480
00:35:51,698 --> 00:35:52,158
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, thanks.

481
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,921
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there other questions?

482
00:35:54,961 --> 00:36:00,306
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't want to go too deep into the financials for this just because it is, we will get behind schedule.

483
00:36:00,766 --> 00:36:03,589
[SPEAKER_15]: We need a second on a motion if someone's willing to do so.

484
00:36:05,791 --> 00:36:06,632
[SPEAKER_15]: I second.

485
00:36:07,172 --> 00:36:08,373
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

486
00:36:09,515 --> 00:36:10,155
[SPEAKER_12]: All in favor?

487
00:36:10,175 --> 00:36:10,235
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

488
00:36:11,216 --> 00:36:11,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

489
00:36:11,777 --> 00:36:11,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

490
00:36:12,597 --> 00:36:13,038
[SPEAKER_12]: Opposed?

491
00:36:15,731 --> 00:36:16,652
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, thank you.

492
00:36:17,672 --> 00:36:22,936
[SPEAKER_12]: We will instruct Daniel that he can write a letter in favor of the pump track.

493
00:36:23,597 --> 00:36:26,058
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll share this document here.

494
00:36:26,439 --> 00:36:31,462
[SPEAKER_14]: And then if you want, I don't know if you have an email that I can send the other things to that you can share out to the group.

495
00:36:32,803 --> 00:36:33,604
[SPEAKER_14]: Just let me know.

496
00:36:33,624 --> 00:36:35,385
[SPEAKER_14]: Bruce, you have my email too.

497
00:36:35,985 --> 00:36:39,048
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, it's probably best if you actually follow up on that thread.

498
00:36:40,309 --> 00:36:41,770
[SPEAKER_15]: That way we'll be sure to get it.

499
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:42,530
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

500
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:43,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Sounds great, Bruce.

501
00:36:43,131 --> 00:36:43,471
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll do that.

502
00:36:45,133 --> 00:36:47,399
[SPEAKER_15]: And you'll put the link in shortly?

503
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,481
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I will.

504
00:36:48,662 --> 00:36:49,343
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for the time.

505
00:36:51,489 --> 00:36:51,689
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

506
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:51,990
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

507
00:36:54,919 --> 00:36:56,180
[SPEAKER_12]: Next up, bike racks.

508
00:36:57,820 --> 00:37:03,444
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a thing that says update from Hormel Stadium Commission, and that says Dennis, who is not here.

509
00:37:04,364 --> 00:37:09,527
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think we'll have to move that for next month and hope that Dennis is back.

510
00:37:11,148 --> 00:37:14,130
[SPEAKER_12]: Asking Todd regarding estimates for installation costs.

511
00:37:14,630 --> 00:37:18,312
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if my emails are disappearing into the ether.

512
00:37:21,534 --> 00:37:23,855
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not getting anything.

513
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:26,256
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm emailing and emailing, and I'm not getting any answer.

514
00:37:27,337 --> 00:37:33,439
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe the next step is to ask Tim, who Todd is usually our point of contact.

515
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:38,241
[SPEAKER_12]: But Tim is presumably able to help answer this question.

516
00:37:38,481 --> 00:37:46,845
[SPEAKER_12]: And hopefully, having been a member of the bike commission himself, would have some interest in helping us move this forward.

517
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:52,823
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, that's so that's, that's all we have about that.

518
00:37:52,943 --> 00:38:01,672
[SPEAKER_12]: It's we're, uh, we're trying hard to ask the city to put in bike racks and they want to know how much it costs and we need somebody to tell us.

519
00:38:02,713 --> 00:38:05,335
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so that's, that's where that is, Ernie.

520
00:38:05,355 --> 00:38:05,455
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

521
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:14,584
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you inquiries just been from yourself or as chair of the commission, or do we need to make a motion?

522
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,609
[SPEAKER_01]: To write a letter as the commission to sort of give this a little more.

523
00:38:19,629 --> 00:38:23,336
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to just try.

524
00:38:23,356 --> 00:38:25,942
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I should just try writing to writing to.

525
00:38:27,473 --> 00:38:29,875
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I do.

526
00:38:29,895 --> 00:38:31,196
[SPEAKER_12]: Tim, one of those T names.

527
00:38:32,757 --> 00:38:34,518
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I should just try writing to Tim.

528
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:39,302
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just a straightforward question.

529
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:48,689
[SPEAKER_12]: The motion that we really want to make is to come back to the city council and the mayor and ask to add a certain amount of money to the budget.

530
00:38:49,589 --> 00:38:53,272
[SPEAKER_12]: And we just need somebody to tell us an amount to add.

531
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:58,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris?

532
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:01,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Does he have a phone number we can just call him up?

533
00:39:01,183 --> 00:39:04,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Or is that crazy?

534
00:39:04,886 --> 00:39:07,388
[SPEAKER_12]: I think he's in and out a lot.

535
00:39:07,468 --> 00:39:11,191
[SPEAKER_12]: I think he's out on the streets a lot during the day.

536
00:39:11,211 --> 00:39:20,478
[SPEAKER_12]: It's possible, but it might take a fair amount of phone tag.

537
00:39:20,898 --> 00:39:21,779
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe that's worth a try.

538
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,182
[SPEAKER_04]: That's worth a shot, right?

539
00:39:25,462 --> 00:39:26,723
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know.

540
00:39:29,308 --> 00:39:30,989
[SPEAKER_04]: I see Alicia saying, reach out to Tim.

541
00:39:31,009 --> 00:39:31,689
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a good idea.

542
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:37,153
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thought I had is we've got some friends over in Arlington now.

543
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:40,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they know how much it costs to install my crack?

544
00:39:40,215 --> 00:39:41,576
[SPEAKER_04]: And can we just use those numbers?

545
00:39:41,616 --> 00:39:44,177
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be probably close enough for a budget number, right?

546
00:39:45,178 --> 00:39:45,738
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I would think.

547
00:39:50,481 --> 00:39:50,721
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.

548
00:39:52,583 --> 00:39:57,346
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, I mean, Alicia, do you have any inputs here?

549
00:39:59,885 --> 00:40:03,667
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're not getting prompt responses from Todd, then ask Tim.

550
00:40:03,707 --> 00:40:05,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Tim is actually his supervisor.

551
00:40:05,769 --> 00:40:17,195
[SPEAKER_08]: And part of the question would actually be whether an outside contractor is doing it, or is it being done as part of a project that's already occurring, or are there city staff to do it?

552
00:40:17,656 --> 00:40:28,062
[SPEAKER_08]: There are very many variables on installing bike racks, as I'm sure you all are aware, but I would go to Tim if Todd's not answering you.

553
00:40:29,045 --> 00:40:53,765
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we know that there are a lot of variables and we know that it could be outside contractors or city staff or something and that might affect it, but it's nobody's job right now and nobody has any instructions to buy them and install them and we don't really care whether it's outside contractors or whether it's city staff and we just want to be able to

554
00:40:55,026 --> 00:40:57,027
[SPEAKER_12]: bike to a store and have a place to park.

555
00:40:57,647 --> 00:40:58,308
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

556
00:40:58,648 --> 00:41:03,930
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll just share as the, not all your members, I don't know if all your members know me, I'm the sustainability director.

557
00:41:05,411 --> 00:41:06,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Dennis is out sick.

558
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:09,613
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd invite you to copy me on that email.

559
00:41:10,153 --> 00:41:10,293
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

560
00:41:10,313 --> 00:41:17,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we can also move it along in here because we care and I have a lot of bikers in my staff as well.

561
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:20,110
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, thanks.

562
00:41:20,151 --> 00:41:22,713
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll certainly do that.

563
00:41:22,733 --> 00:41:28,779
[SPEAKER_12]: It's something we've been asking about for a long time in various places, but haven't

564
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:31,588
[SPEAKER_12]: I haven't managed to get any progress, so.

565
00:41:32,768 --> 00:41:43,592
[SPEAKER_08]: If I know that you all have active requests in, then it's much easier for me to just sort of push those along rather than, I don't want to have different requests or separate things.

566
00:41:43,913 --> 00:41:47,894
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would like to personally see more bike racks.

567
00:41:49,035 --> 00:41:51,856
[SPEAKER_08]: I keep locking up my bike to signs, so.

568
00:41:52,656 --> 00:41:53,557
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, well, thank you.

569
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:55,799
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll we'll send you we'll copy you on that.

570
00:41:56,039 --> 00:41:56,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

571
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:57,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you sorry?

572
00:41:57,301 --> 00:42:00,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you suggesting to be copied on the email to Tim?

573
00:42:01,265 --> 00:42:10,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Or once we hear back from Tim about how much it costs the email about that on the email to Tim, he and I walk across the hall from each other as colleagues and also.

574
00:42:11,405 --> 00:42:13,726
[SPEAKER_08]: and we collaborate on a lot of projects.

575
00:42:14,626 --> 00:42:22,829
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, feel free to copy me just in general on the bike rack stuff, because I'd like to get it moved through in a better clip.

576
00:42:23,729 --> 00:42:24,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thanks.

577
00:42:24,669 --> 00:42:25,109
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do that.

578
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:30,351
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm also just going to mention that I'm probably going to leave in a few minutes, and I'll make Emily the host.

579
00:42:30,691 --> 00:42:31,831
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you guys are all set.

580
00:42:31,951 --> 00:42:32,632
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't need to.

581
00:42:32,712 --> 00:42:33,052
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

582
00:42:34,092 --> 00:42:35,172
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we're good.

583
00:42:35,353 --> 00:42:35,693
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

584
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:36,733
[SPEAKER_12]: Appreciate it.

585
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:46,266
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll wait to hear from Dennis about bike racks for Hormel Stadium.

586
00:42:50,251 --> 00:42:56,219
[SPEAKER_12]: And we need an update from Daniel about C-Click Fix, but we need to hear that from Daniel, and he's not here.

587
00:42:56,279 --> 00:42:57,981
[SPEAKER_12]: So next up is events.

588
00:42:59,657 --> 00:43:02,439
[SPEAKER_12]: I think he's not here, but he is coordinating the people to be there.

589
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:05,001
[SPEAKER_12]: Bruce wanted to talk about the mystic river celebration.

590
00:43:05,361 --> 00:43:05,541
[SPEAKER_12]: We.

591
00:43:14,527 --> 00:43:16,148
[SPEAKER_15]: We had gotten kind of blindsided by that.

592
00:43:16,168 --> 00:43:19,270
[SPEAKER_15]: And I realized what happened is we had an email exchange about it.

593
00:43:20,451 --> 00:43:23,873
[SPEAKER_15]: And it never made it back into any of our official agenda.

594
00:43:24,273 --> 00:43:26,994
[SPEAKER_15]: And Emily, I think you were involved in that email thread as well.

595
00:43:27,675 --> 00:43:33,018
[SPEAKER_15]: And so at the last minute, we thought we'd try to put it together, only to discover that there weren't sufficient.

596
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:34,899
[SPEAKER_15]: We didn't have enough manpower to do it.

597
00:43:35,059 --> 00:43:38,861
[SPEAKER_15]: So we wrote to Cash and said, we're not going to do it.

598
00:43:39,402 --> 00:43:41,203
[SPEAKER_15]: So bottom line there, we don't have to worry about it.

599
00:43:42,043 --> 00:43:45,248
[SPEAKER_15]: And yeah, you're right, Daniel's taking care of Harvest Your Energy, that's in a while.

600
00:43:45,268 --> 00:43:49,933
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you want me to move on with the Tufts Community Day?

601
00:43:50,512 --> 00:43:51,032
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, go for it.

602
00:43:51,353 --> 00:43:53,974
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, so I'm the coordinator for Tufts Community Day.

603
00:43:54,835 --> 00:43:56,496
[SPEAKER_15]: And whoops, hang on, let me.

604
00:43:56,756 --> 00:43:57,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Bruce.

605
00:43:57,857 --> 00:43:59,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, one more thing.

606
00:43:59,898 --> 00:44:04,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Harvest Your Energy is October 18th, so actually maybe before your next meeting.

607
00:44:05,682 --> 00:44:08,604
[SPEAKER_08]: And we really want to have the bike commission represented at it.

608
00:44:08,744 --> 00:44:11,186
[SPEAKER_15]: We've already applied as far as I know.

609
00:44:11,486 --> 00:44:11,826
[SPEAKER_08]: Committed?

610
00:44:12,126 --> 00:44:12,327
[SPEAKER_08]: Good.

611
00:44:12,567 --> 00:44:13,247
[SPEAKER_15]: How can I tell?

612
00:44:13,547 --> 00:44:15,509
[SPEAKER_08]: How can you check that?

613
00:44:15,689 --> 00:44:17,430
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll check my list on my end.

614
00:44:18,677 --> 00:44:21,623
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I think we had already agreed to go and we should be.

615
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:25,231
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, we should be signed up.

616
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:26,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

617
00:44:27,397 --> 00:44:28,417
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm double-checking that.

618
00:44:28,818 --> 00:44:29,618
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

619
00:44:29,638 --> 00:44:31,019
[SPEAKER_15]: While we're checking that, we could move on.

620
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:33,541
[SPEAKER_15]: So Tufts Community Day is October the 5th.

621
00:44:34,481 --> 00:44:36,583
[SPEAKER_15]: And I at least will show up.

622
00:44:36,903 --> 00:44:37,463
[SPEAKER_15]: And we are there.

623
00:44:37,483 --> 00:44:37,563
[SPEAKER_15]: Good.

624
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:37,843
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

625
00:44:38,344 --> 00:44:43,367
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll send out email to anybody who can help volunteer for that.

626
00:44:43,407 --> 00:44:45,228
[SPEAKER_15]: It's kind of standard tabling.

627
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:49,151
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll show up and answer questions and say hi to everybody.

628
00:44:49,811 --> 00:44:52,313
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's that.

629
00:44:53,453 --> 00:44:53,674
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

630
00:44:53,694 --> 00:44:53,954
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks.

631
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:58,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, do we have people identified for that?

632
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:00,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I was planning on going.

633
00:45:01,474 --> 00:45:04,978
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but I'll do so before then by just watch your email.

634
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:10,246
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll send it out to the whole list and we can coordinate any scheduling or logistics.

635
00:45:10,807 --> 00:45:12,269
[SPEAKER_04]: How many do we need typically for that?

636
00:45:13,364 --> 00:45:27,596
[SPEAKER_15]: One person will do, it's just, you know, if you're there for three hours, it's kind of, you get a dry mouth and it's always useful to have two people because often people show up in pairs for some reason, you know, so it's good to have two or three people at the booth.

637
00:45:28,356 --> 00:45:32,199
[SPEAKER_12]: I will say also that that one, it's kind of a long trip if you need to use the bathroom.

638
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:37,484
[SPEAKER_12]: So if there's only one person and you need to use the bathroom, you're gone for a long time.

639
00:45:37,504 --> 00:45:39,866
[SPEAKER_12]: So.

640
00:45:40,266 --> 00:45:40,646
[SPEAKER_02]: He tells.

641
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:45,154
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

642
00:45:47,635 --> 00:45:49,316
[SPEAKER_12]: Next step is bike light report.

643
00:45:49,716 --> 00:45:50,016
[SPEAKER_12]: Ernie.

644
00:45:50,036 --> 00:45:51,577
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, everybody.

645
00:45:52,497 --> 00:45:57,419
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really glad that both Alicia and Adam are here.

646
00:45:57,439 --> 00:45:59,761
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope Alicia is still here for a few minutes.

647
00:46:00,641 --> 00:46:08,805
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent out a report to the commission last week that Anna took up my

648
00:46:09,481 --> 00:46:14,302
[SPEAKER_01]: invitation to help me pack the lights for this fall's go-around.

649
00:46:14,762 --> 00:46:21,604
[SPEAKER_01]: And she and I, in a record three hours, packed 200 bike light kits last week.

650
00:46:22,664 --> 00:46:29,426
[SPEAKER_01]: And I distributed them to the five schools and a few miscellaneous the following day, last Thursday.

651
00:46:29,446 --> 00:46:30,887
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're all set.

652
00:46:31,447 --> 00:46:35,388
[SPEAKER_01]: In visiting JRA, I found out from Adam that

653
00:46:36,068 --> 00:46:56,077
[SPEAKER_01]: Alicia did pay their invoice for last year's supply of lights, which I'm to receive from JRA soon, and that I followed up with an invoice as directed by us, the commission, for 2025 to 26 bike light kits and the needed 500 copies of the

654
00:47:04,513 --> 00:47:09,619
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, American bicycle leagues, uh, whatever they're called, uh, quick guide.

655
00:47:10,279 --> 00:47:10,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

656
00:47:10,620 --> 00:47:12,622
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an invoice total of just over $1,800.

657
00:47:12,722 --> 00:47:24,474
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, Adam at JRA is to submit that to Alicia, hopefully for payment in a reasonable due course.

658
00:47:26,091 --> 00:47:28,192
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's it.

659
00:47:28,672 --> 00:47:43,858
[SPEAKER_01]: So distributing 160 last week leaves 200 packed and another 40 or so to use this fall and winter, a total of 80 spares.

660
00:47:44,038 --> 00:47:48,120
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we get into next year's supply in the spring.

661
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:58,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, again, was pre-purchased this past summer to avoid tariffs and to keep the price lower by combining shipping.

662
00:47:59,224 --> 00:48:04,666
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why the expenses for last year and this year kind of piled up on each other.

663
00:48:05,892 --> 00:48:10,495
[SPEAKER_01]: And that will bring up, you know, discussions about funding for us in the future.

664
00:48:11,376 --> 00:48:25,507
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I should be segueing into a working group report now on helmets next, I could just continue with that if that's okay with our secretary and the chair.

665
00:48:27,998 --> 00:48:29,439
[SPEAKER_11]: Fine with me.

666
00:48:30,099 --> 00:48:30,200
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.

667
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,701
[SPEAKER_01]: So the three of us were charged with looking at that.

668
00:48:32,761 --> 00:48:51,755
[SPEAKER_01]: And thanks to the help of Eric quickly saying, just go to Helmet Saraz, we determined that, and with great thanks to Virginia Tech's labors in testing the entire universe of helmets therein, we found a star helmet

669
00:48:52,455 --> 00:49:12,657
[SPEAKER_01]: with a substantially decent score of three stars out of five, which at $11 each meets the criteria of looking kid-friendly, modern, safe, available in three colors, can be purchased.

670
00:49:13,615 --> 00:49:23,779
[SPEAKER_01]: can be purchased in a minimum lot of 24, but with Logo, if we wanted to get Medford about it, we'd have to order 480.

671
00:49:24,899 --> 00:49:36,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Those helmets are their so-called model nine, which is infamous for being a knockout value at $11 each.

672
00:49:36,904 --> 00:49:39,985
[SPEAKER_01]: They come in small, medium, large, and extra large.

673
00:49:40,851 --> 00:49:52,505
[SPEAKER_01]: We also found a toddler, a smaller helmet that is on sale right now for about $7 instead of $11.

674
00:49:53,867 --> 00:49:58,493
[SPEAKER_01]: And all these sizes, colors, and styles could be mixed up to make an order of 24.

675
00:50:00,345 --> 00:50:08,968
[SPEAKER_01]: The events we had in the past, I think we would give out roughly 50 helmets or so at each event.

676
00:50:09,888 --> 00:50:24,994
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would suggest that if we can come up with some funding that we should spend, it's about $500 to get 50 helmets for a next event to give them out and to have and to evaluate.

677
00:50:25,922 --> 00:50:30,926
[SPEAKER_01]: and start an efficient campaign around this.

678
00:50:31,687 --> 00:50:41,135
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we wanted to, you know, blast the city's kids with a thousand helmets, you know, it's going to cost us $10,000.

679
00:50:42,837 --> 00:50:48,221
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a significant amount of money that we have to find funding for.

680
00:50:48,642 --> 00:50:51,784
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to propose, I think, that I order

681
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:57,517
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 helmets of a variety of sizes that we need, maybe

682
00:50:58,705 --> 00:51:03,248
[SPEAKER_01]: three quarters for kids and adults and one quarter for toddlers.

683
00:51:04,469 --> 00:51:07,111
[SPEAKER_01]: And they come from Washington, D.C.

684
00:51:07,491 --> 00:51:08,973
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, Washington state.

685
00:51:09,573 --> 00:51:12,695
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not waiting five weeks from Singapore.

686
00:51:13,636 --> 00:51:20,861
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes, maybe we could duplicate their kinds of efforts in scouring Asia for great deals.

687
00:51:21,582 --> 00:51:24,344
[SPEAKER_01]: But it looks like helmets are doing a

688
00:51:24,944 --> 00:51:33,477
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty good job of that and maybe only making a modicum of profit such that we needn't reinvent the wheel here.

689
00:51:34,879 --> 00:51:58,134
[SPEAKER_01]: as we have not been able to find out who the source was of our original supply, nor would it cost the legal team who sponsored them to get them, especially if they were paying for their logos to be put on and required such a large minimum printing

690
00:51:59,234 --> 00:52:07,877
[SPEAKER_01]: effort to have a minimum order of 500 pieces, which is just onerous for us at this stage.

691
00:52:11,098 --> 00:52:11,738
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's it.

692
00:52:11,758 --> 00:52:22,622
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping to just open a small discussion now as to how to proceed and whether we should jump on this experiment or whether we just table this and look for $500 or $1,000 to start to fund this campaign.

693
00:52:26,843 --> 00:52:34,408
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we have now wiped out this year's budget with the bike-like kits and the quick guides that we need.

694
00:52:34,928 --> 00:52:36,549
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are looking for some funding.

695
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:39,792
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad that Alicia is here to respond to that.

696
00:52:40,052 --> 00:52:52,640
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just, again, thankful for Adam and JRA for acting as an intermediary for some of our purchases and distribution of funds.

697
00:52:53,600 --> 00:53:02,487
[SPEAKER_01]: and asking Adam if he's about to send to Alicia the invoice I presented last week for next year's needs.

698
00:53:03,308 --> 00:53:08,472
[SPEAKER_01]: So how fortuitous and serendipitous that we're all here at the table tonight.

699
00:53:10,974 --> 00:53:11,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

700
00:53:13,656 --> 00:53:18,620
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we have any other possibly identified fundraising

701
00:53:20,315 --> 00:53:20,855
[SPEAKER_15]: sources.

702
00:53:22,436 --> 00:53:24,157
[SPEAKER_15]: Did Brookline Bank not step up?

703
00:53:24,177 --> 00:53:25,757
[SPEAKER_15]: Did I hear that from before?

704
00:53:25,837 --> 00:53:27,158
[SPEAKER_15]: Or is that another one?

705
00:53:27,338 --> 00:53:31,459
[SPEAKER_15]: Or are there other organizations we think we might be able to get some funding from?

706
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Bruce, I'm sorry.

707
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:40,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I am in receipt of Brookline Bank's check for $500 that I have to give to Alicia when I bike down there.

708
00:53:42,583 --> 00:53:46,905
[SPEAKER_01]: So that means that yes, the invoice I'm putting forth for $1,800 is really only $1,300.

709
00:53:50,115 --> 00:53:52,817
[SPEAKER_01]: because of that donation.

710
00:53:53,137 --> 00:53:57,320
[SPEAKER_01]: There had been a couple of smaller donations in the past.

711
00:53:57,680 --> 00:54:06,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Wegmans was so difficult to get through to and with such delay that their $250 effort, I haven't tickled yet.

712
00:54:06,446 --> 00:54:19,295
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to ask JRA for a similar effort because of the work they're doing as liaison for us and that they are the bike store in Medford and part of this community.

713
00:54:20,296 --> 00:54:30,267
[SPEAKER_01]: An untapped one that sits high in my priority list to knock on is waste management, who is so invested in the city and a large.

714
00:54:32,888 --> 00:54:38,534
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the city's infrastructure that I think that they should come along with funds to help us out.

715
00:54:38,995 --> 00:54:49,065
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, otherwise the larger the bank, the thicker the boilerplate to try to get through to get some funding.

716
00:54:49,806 --> 00:54:53,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Smaller organizations are much easier

717
00:54:55,087 --> 00:55:04,971
[SPEAKER_01]: to talk with and develop a relationship with, but it's hard to ask them in these times for funding for community efforts like this.

718
00:55:06,271 --> 00:55:07,092
[SPEAKER_11]: Anna, I see you coming up.

719
00:55:07,152 --> 00:55:15,255
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I just wanted to inquire, and apologies for not knowing this, but in terms of exactly what the

720
00:55:16,377 --> 00:55:31,499
[SPEAKER_10]: commission is a lot of, if you're going to apply or look for funding, they'll ask if you're a 501c3, what officially is the commission and in terms of going about looking for funding, are there any like limitations with that that we should know about?

721
00:55:33,642 --> 00:55:37,564
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, the commission is an advisory commission to the mayor.

722
00:55:38,704 --> 00:55:40,325
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so we're not a nonprofit.

723
00:55:40,385 --> 00:55:41,645
[SPEAKER_12]: We're not anything like that.

724
00:55:42,706 --> 00:55:44,107
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, Alicia, I see your hand up.

725
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:46,448
[SPEAKER_12]: You can explain it better than I can probably.

726
00:55:47,688 --> 00:55:53,210
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I feel like I should jump in because actually the city is a nonprofit.

727
00:55:54,151 --> 00:55:54,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Um,

728
00:55:55,217 --> 00:55:59,118
[SPEAKER_08]: And in a way, so we are a tax-deductible organization.

729
00:56:00,898 --> 00:56:03,119
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's complicated, and it can get difficult.

730
00:56:04,719 --> 00:56:09,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Technically, when the city gets donations, the city council is supposed to accept them.

731
00:56:10,281 --> 00:56:11,901
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know that this always happens.

732
00:56:12,081 --> 00:56:18,503
[SPEAKER_08]: It happens on big things, whether or not we jump through those kinds of hoops for something like this.

733
00:56:20,275 --> 00:56:36,065
[SPEAKER_08]: It's also complicated for the city to receive donations for directed things, which is why you might notice that there are a lot of organizations, like the library has friends at the Medford Public Library, and the community gardens has friends at the community garden.

734
00:56:36,525 --> 00:56:44,691
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is so that they can receive money and spend money outside of the municipal legal government framework.

735
00:56:46,468 --> 00:56:55,390
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I just sort of put it out there because there isn't like anything like that on the bike side, but there are bike organizations that might be willing to work with you.

736
00:56:56,110 --> 00:57:03,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to sort of think out of the box, because if the group did serious fundraising, it could become a problem because you don't actually have a way.

737
00:57:03,752 --> 00:57:06,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Like if I get an unsolicited check, it goes to the general fund.

738
00:57:07,412 --> 00:57:08,873
[SPEAKER_08]: It doesn't come to my office.

739
00:57:09,293 --> 00:57:11,613
[SPEAKER_08]: It has to be for specific purposes.

740
00:57:11,633 --> 00:57:14,854
[SPEAKER_08]: But we can try and figure out how to work it out.

741
00:57:17,154 --> 00:57:23,776
[SPEAKER_08]: That said, yeah, I just kind of wanted with this, the fundraising piece.

742
00:57:24,096 --> 00:57:38,519
[SPEAKER_08]: The other thing that I just want to feel like it's really helpful for everybody to know is that there's, because when the, because you're an official arm of the body of the city, you have to follow municipal procurement law, which is cumbersome, difficult, annoying.

743
00:57:38,539 --> 00:57:39,619
[SPEAKER_08]: 100%, it's ridiculous.

744
00:57:42,040 --> 00:58:00,448
[SPEAKER_08]: But it does mean that for purchases like over a certain dollar value, so any expenditure that our office makes over $100 in advance, we have to make what's called a purchase order in the system, which basically reserves the money in the system.

745
00:58:00,848 --> 00:58:08,592
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you guys are planning to spend money, I ask that you email us first and tell us about it first so we can get that set up.

746
00:58:09,152 --> 00:58:12,013
[SPEAKER_08]: and preferably with some sort of documentation.

747
00:58:12,053 --> 00:58:22,338
[SPEAKER_08]: So I actually took the email that Ernie sent, and I sent it to my head clerk and said, please create a purchase order for JRA cycles for this dollar amount.

748
00:58:23,158 --> 00:58:26,099
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when the invoice comes in, I can pay the invoice.

749
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:29,381
[SPEAKER_08]: Technically, I'm supposed to do that before you spend the money.

750
00:58:31,081 --> 00:58:34,523
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything over $1,000, we're supposed to get multiple quotes for.

751
00:58:35,063 --> 00:58:46,807
[SPEAKER_08]: And I know like Ernie does all this research and gets this information, but then I need copies of like the other places that were too expensive so that we can put it in the file and give it to the procurement office.

752
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:56,770
[SPEAKER_08]: And all of that is because it's an official arm of the city, whereas if you were like just a friends group or a separate nonprofit, you could spend money however you wanted to.

753
00:58:58,190 --> 00:58:59,591
[SPEAKER_08]: But we do provide the bank account.

754
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:03,952
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a tax ID number for you that we can provide.

755
00:59:04,493 --> 00:59:12,001
[SPEAKER_01]: An intermediate question then, let's say we're going through with initial purchase of bike helmets, $500 or $1,000.

756
00:59:12,041 --> 00:59:26,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to be the purchaser of that or again go through some scheme where I pre-purchase to get inventory quickly and then you have to figure out how to pay me?

757
00:59:27,457 --> 00:59:37,004
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is the problem is that where we came into like reimbursing residents for large sums of money starts to look sketchy when the city gets audited, right?

758
00:59:37,084 --> 00:59:39,125
[SPEAKER_08]: And we get audited all the place.

759
00:59:39,505 --> 00:59:40,966
[SPEAKER_08]: That's kind of part of it, right?

760
00:59:41,387 --> 00:59:50,573
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's better if we could make the purchase, but we can't just buy from everywhere, which is where the problem that we ran into, right?

761
00:59:50,613 --> 00:59:56,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Like it was a firm in China and they couldn't give us proper looking

762
00:59:57,304 --> 01:00:06,689
[SPEAKER_08]: invoices, like nothing looked legitimate that our finance office felt comfortable paying because they work, they operate in a different worldview than we do.

763
01:00:07,229 --> 01:00:07,529
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

764
01:00:07,749 --> 01:00:17,094
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a dollar amount limit that you're telling us we should be careful to operate differently above or below, like $500 or $1,000?

765
01:00:17,875 --> 01:00:18,055
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

766
01:00:18,215 --> 01:00:21,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Over $1,000, we absolutely need like quotes, examples of what other things, like

767
01:00:27,012 --> 01:00:34,495
[SPEAKER_08]: that you quoted it with multiple places that you were being responsible, and we have to issue a purchase order before you make the purchase.

768
01:00:34,875 --> 01:00:49,181
[SPEAKER_01]: So because the shit may be hitting the fan, so getting 100 helmets for $950 is something that we may be able to move more quickly on than a larger stocking order of helmets.

769
01:00:50,661 --> 01:00:52,442
[SPEAKER_04]: I would assume, Alicia, that we could.

770
01:00:55,570 --> 01:01:01,973
[SPEAKER_04]: I assume we could go look, you know, we've, there's like five or six of these different companies that provide low cost helmets.

771
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:06,915
[SPEAKER_04]: I imagine we could say like, all right, here's like three companies that provide low cost helmets.

772
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:10,296
[SPEAKER_04]: A hundred would cost $9.50 here, $1,000, $12 here.

773
01:01:10,577 --> 01:01:13,398
[SPEAKER_04]: So it may not be that much more time consuming.

774
01:01:13,418 --> 01:01:17,700
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, we gotta do the diligence to show that we've looked at pricing at multiple suppliers.

775
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:19,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Which you guys are doing.

776
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:24,943
[SPEAKER_08]: It's sort of like get the printouts, get the screenshots and send them to us so we have the documentation.

777
01:01:25,695 --> 01:01:30,698
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it's better if we reach out to the company and see if we can make the purchase.

778
01:01:31,538 --> 01:01:35,180
[SPEAKER_08]: We run into problems where the city doesn't have a credit card.

779
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:37,801
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't buy things on credit cards.

780
01:01:37,901 --> 01:01:42,183
[SPEAKER_08]: We literally can only buy from companies that will sell us something.

781
01:01:42,604 --> 01:01:45,945
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we send them a check after we receive the product.

782
01:01:46,466 --> 01:01:51,528
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is also archaic, but we haven't been able to get the finance office to move on that.

783
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:52,969
[SPEAKER_08]: You've been paid out?

784
01:01:54,470 --> 01:01:54,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry?

785
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,201
[SPEAKER_08]: even to use PayPal?

786
01:01:58,101 --> 01:01:59,682
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we really can't do that.

787
01:01:59,702 --> 01:02:00,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Instant money?

788
01:02:01,403 --> 01:02:02,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

789
01:02:02,464 --> 01:02:14,110
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually have an Amazon account that is a business account where we order things with our Amazon business account and then they send me city invoices and the city sends them checks.

790
01:02:16,351 --> 01:02:17,752
[SPEAKER_08]: And we do the same with Home Depot.

791
01:02:20,243 --> 01:02:25,206
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are larger companies actually understand this conceptually and work with us.

792
01:02:25,266 --> 01:02:40,634
[SPEAKER_08]: The problem is this, it's really horrible because we want as a government, we like, or as value-based people, we want to support small businesses, but we actually, because of Massachusetts procurement law, have trouble, a lot of trouble supporting small businesses.

793
01:02:42,115 --> 01:02:44,296
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, as voters, I'm letting y'all know.

794
01:02:47,766 --> 01:02:59,795
[SPEAKER_12]: To bring this back around to where we stand right now, we have now a good line on a good model of helmet to get and where to get it from.

795
01:03:00,595 --> 01:03:04,358
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to figure out what are going to be the mechanics of making that happen.

796
01:03:06,099 --> 01:03:13,764
[SPEAKER_12]: It seems like our options are, one, we go through the procurement process that Alicia just described, in which case

797
01:03:14,904 --> 01:03:17,909
[SPEAKER_12]: That vendor has to be somebody that the city can buy from.

798
01:03:19,111 --> 01:03:24,239
[SPEAKER_12]: So if this it's if the city can buy from that vendor, then that seems like a good plan.

799
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:26,123
[SPEAKER_12]: We then have to figure out how to get the money.

800
01:03:27,648 --> 01:03:29,649
[SPEAKER_12]: to do that because we have used up our budget.

801
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:36,354
[SPEAKER_12]: The other thing we can do is work with another organization.

802
01:03:36,374 --> 01:03:47,361
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if this is something we could ask MassBike or BCU about and see if they would help us facilitate this process.

803
01:03:48,402 --> 01:03:58,147
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I wouldn't be surprised if MassBike would be willing to, we can't possibly be the first city group to have a similar issue like this.

804
01:03:59,048 --> 01:04:05,391
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so that might be worth an inquiry to see if they can help us facilitate this.

805
01:04:05,651 --> 01:04:17,758
[SPEAKER_12]: In which case, then if we find a donor who is willing to spend or donate the money for helmets, then that donor donates to MassBike and MassBike can buy the helmets.

806
01:04:20,361 --> 01:04:26,206
[SPEAKER_12]: Adam says, looks like helmets are a sorter form would allow for them invoicing the city and the city sending a check.

807
01:04:26,866 --> 01:04:34,873
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's- That part strikes me as like, that's a pretty typical process for businesses.

808
01:04:35,554 --> 01:04:38,477
[SPEAKER_12]: So then the question is the fundraising side of it.

809
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:48,217
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so I guess my question remains, like, for the fundraising, if we want to do the fundraising, do we have to go through an actual 501c3?

810
01:04:48,457 --> 01:04:54,782
[SPEAKER_10]: And if so, would that be the first step is to find a 501c3 that would sponsor if we can find a donor and then find it?

811
01:04:55,602 --> 01:04:57,404
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what you're up and saying, am I right?

812
01:04:57,704 --> 01:05:01,266
[SPEAKER_04]: They could be the intermediary for accepting a donation.

813
01:05:02,843 --> 01:05:05,644
[SPEAKER_12]: and then buy the helmets.

814
01:05:07,225 --> 01:05:16,628
[SPEAKER_12]: If there's, Alicia, can you remind me again what you said about if we had donors who were willing to send the city a check?

815
01:05:20,049 --> 01:05:27,531
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll bank them out to the city of Medford, you'll go through my office, but try and talk to me in advance, because then I can try and figure something out.

816
01:05:27,571 --> 01:05:31,813
[SPEAKER_08]: I might go to the finance office and ask them, how should we work this out?

817
01:05:33,821 --> 01:05:45,205
[SPEAKER_08]: At one point, we worked something out for the dog park, but like literally creating a revolving account also involves going to the city council for a vote, none of which is completely impossible, but it's like a lot of hoops.

818
01:05:46,325 --> 01:05:48,006
[SPEAKER_08]: But once you've done it, you've done it.

819
01:05:48,026 --> 01:06:00,670
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to think the other thing that could like that as you were talking about finding donors is sometimes we actually try and find somebody who will do pay for it directly.

820
01:06:01,241 --> 01:06:12,651
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, with the Harvester Energy Festival, Mass Energy Alliance doesn't give us money to pay musicians, they pay the musicians directly for us, we set it all up, but then they pay them.

821
01:06:14,272 --> 01:06:25,762
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've said that that is sort of also an option that if you found like a happy donor that wanted to work with you, asking them like, hey, could you actually just buy us these 900 helmets or whatever?

822
01:06:27,383 --> 01:06:29,205
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you don't have a problem.

823
01:06:30,722 --> 01:06:41,631
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, you might want the city like I don't know if you've ever seen like the mayor will go in front of the city council with like the bang and say they're donating all these backpacks to us.

824
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:42,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

825
01:06:42,812 --> 01:06:46,055
[SPEAKER_08]: And the city council, by the way, votes and accepts those backpacks.

826
01:06:48,357 --> 01:06:48,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Hmm.

827
01:06:51,372 --> 01:06:58,361
[SPEAKER_12]: So in that, if we have a donor that does that, then we need to ask the city council to accept the donation of the helmets?

828
01:06:59,382 --> 01:07:01,285
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, and that's something we can talk about.

829
01:07:01,745 --> 01:07:04,909
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of a good thing to do when then everybody gets good, happy PR.

830
01:07:06,431 --> 01:07:06,631
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

831
01:07:07,462 --> 01:07:21,491
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, so then our next question, it seems like if we have, if we had like one or two donors willing to spend 500, donate 500 or 1000, we could just ask them to buy the helmets.

832
01:07:22,312 --> 01:07:25,454
[SPEAKER_12]: And I doubt that the difference in

833
01:07:26,314 --> 01:07:38,046
[SPEAKER_12]: Pricing or shipping would be much versus two orders of $500 versus one order of 1,000, since they're bulky and they have to ship in big boxes that are not the entire order anyway.

834
01:07:38,066 --> 01:07:43,532
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we have donors, they can just buy the helmets.

835
01:07:49,345 --> 01:07:55,989
[SPEAKER_01]: It appears to be about 20 helmets per shipping crate, either from helmets or us.

836
01:07:56,369 --> 01:07:59,791
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to have to be stored in multiple locations anyway.

837
01:08:00,272 --> 01:08:00,972
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah.

838
01:08:01,332 --> 01:08:08,637
[SPEAKER_12]: In that case, it might actually not be a terrible thing if we have a bunch of small donors who want to donate $250 at a time.

839
01:08:09,397 --> 01:08:13,520
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we only have to store $250 worth of helmets until we run out and find some more.

840
01:08:16,041 --> 01:08:17,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's 25 helmets.

841
01:08:17,702 --> 01:08:18,483
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about half.

842
01:08:19,072 --> 01:08:21,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Right cover one event.

843
01:08:21,777 --> 01:08:28,467
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I'm thinking more and 50, 50 lot units, which is storable and.

844
01:08:30,036 --> 01:08:35,499
[SPEAKER_01]: $500 is not too onerous, and it's what I usually start when I'm asking for bike donations.

845
01:08:36,359 --> 01:08:44,804
[SPEAKER_01]: And if someone says that's onerous, I'll offer them half of that, when I really hope that we could get $1,000 sponsors and not just $500.

846
01:08:46,145 --> 01:08:48,626
[SPEAKER_01]: That hasn't happened yet, even with Brookline Bank.

847
01:08:50,417 --> 01:09:00,630
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of quantity, one other thing to consider is, because helmets do expire and the foam wears out, we don't want to have too many because then they start to be unsafe.

848
01:09:01,832 --> 01:09:05,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe better for that reason to have smaller quantities and refresh them more often.

849
01:09:05,977 --> 01:09:12,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the technical information I have on that is that if they're not used and stored well, they have unlimited shelf life.

850
01:09:13,403 --> 01:09:21,729
[SPEAKER_01]: They're 15 to 20 year things if stored as new old stock.

851
01:09:22,389 --> 01:09:29,234
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only if you use them for a year and get them sweaty and then they deteriorate and dry.

852
01:09:29,454 --> 01:09:30,735
[SPEAKER_01]: UV exposure.

853
01:09:31,556 --> 01:09:33,718
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get UV degradation as well.

854
01:09:36,685 --> 01:09:44,608
[SPEAKER_12]: So in interest of keeping this moving along, I think where we are is that we have identified a source of helmets.

855
01:09:44,888 --> 01:09:47,169
[SPEAKER_12]: We need to identify some sources of funding.

856
01:09:47,769 --> 01:09:53,852
[SPEAKER_12]: Ernie, are you willing to keep asking around or do we need to see who else is willing to go looking for donors?

857
01:09:54,512 --> 01:09:57,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, please join on board because I'm a

858
01:09:58,388 --> 01:10:04,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Not completely tapped out here, but I'm lacking creativity as to who to ask.

859
01:10:04,650 --> 01:10:10,272
[SPEAKER_01]: The real estate companies promise they'll help, and then when it comes down to it, they don't pick up the phone.

860
01:10:12,733 --> 01:10:13,893
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's that kind of thing.

861
01:10:14,553 --> 01:10:16,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe insurance companies, other

862
01:10:19,003 --> 01:10:29,105
[SPEAKER_01]: helpers in the city, but again, the larger the institution, the bigger the boiler plate and the more they're apt to say, Oh, we already give to 20 other concerns stand in line.

863
01:10:29,845 --> 01:10:31,066
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's reasonable too.

864
01:10:31,726 --> 01:10:40,848
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Alicia has perhaps a lot more to say on this too, dealing with, you know, similar activities and donor networks.

865
01:10:42,408 --> 01:10:44,829
[SPEAKER_06]: Adam, do we have, um,

866
01:10:47,267 --> 01:10:49,388
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know exactly how to explain this.

867
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:55,371
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're asking for donations for these helmets, what do we tell people they're for?

868
01:10:55,391 --> 01:11:01,514
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we have a standard like, hey, we're buying these helmets, we do this all the time because people don't have enough helmets?

869
01:11:01,554 --> 01:11:03,715
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we propose this to people?

870
01:11:05,746 --> 01:11:07,847
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a life.

871
01:11:08,167 --> 01:11:19,910
[SPEAKER_12]: We have distributed them at events, like when there's community events, if we have a table or when we have a bike rodeo, we basically only deal with kids' helmets.

872
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:28,512
[SPEAKER_12]: We take every opportunity we can to get them on kids' heads, especially if we can get to kids who don't have them yet.

873
01:11:29,953 --> 01:11:31,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a state law.

874
01:11:32,382 --> 01:11:35,343
[SPEAKER_01]: that kids on bikes have to wear helmets.

875
01:11:36,304 --> 01:11:47,169
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm not arguing that people should have, that kids need helmets, but I just, when we're, you know, if I'm going to call up a bank, what am I going to say to the bank?

876
01:11:48,049 --> 01:11:49,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you can start with that argument.

877
01:11:50,010 --> 01:11:51,431
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a legal requirement.

878
01:11:51,931 --> 01:11:59,215
[SPEAKER_12]: I think his question is not whether we should be asking them to, whether, not why we want to give kids helmets.

879
01:11:59,775 --> 01:12:01,736
[SPEAKER_12]: It's how and where are we giving kids helmets?

880
01:12:03,257 --> 01:12:12,784
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and you can also say that every year 500 new kids enter the public schools, and maybe 200 of them ride bikes.

881
01:12:14,625 --> 01:12:18,308
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a whole lot of backlog that we haven't covered yet.

882
01:12:18,388 --> 01:12:24,772
[SPEAKER_01]: So the need is for thousands of helmets in order to assure every kid in Medford who rides a bike has a helmet.

883
01:12:25,913 --> 01:12:30,677
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not sure that the argument needs much

884
01:12:31,796 --> 01:12:33,497
[SPEAKER_01]: backup or rationale.

885
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:36,180
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a state law, it protects lives.

886
01:12:41,064 --> 01:12:42,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Lights are a little trickier even.

887
01:12:42,745 --> 01:12:48,630
[SPEAKER_01]: The helmets to me are a slam dunk except for their logistical complexity.

888
01:12:49,371 --> 01:12:51,773
[SPEAKER_01]: They're big and they cost money and you have to fit them.

889
01:12:53,054 --> 01:12:57,698
[SPEAKER_12]: Adam, was your question about how we are actually getting them to the kids?

890
01:13:00,439 --> 01:13:21,366
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess, I guess what I'm not hearing that might make this more compelling to potential donors is like, you know, we have a thing we do every year where we donate, you know, X amount of helmets to kids who don't have one.

891
01:13:21,986 --> 01:13:27,108
[SPEAKER_06]: We're asking for donations to buy those helmets for that thing this year again.

892
01:13:29,168 --> 01:13:32,669
[SPEAKER_12]: You're talking about targeting a specific event.

893
01:13:35,710 --> 01:13:36,631
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really know.

894
01:13:36,651 --> 01:13:54,557
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sort of brainstorming here, but it feels like it would be easier to solicit donations if we had a very specific ask with how we're going to get them to people and all of that.

895
01:13:55,732 --> 01:13:58,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let me just answer.

896
01:14:00,016 --> 01:14:14,311
[SPEAKER_01]: With the bike lights, it's easy for me to explain that the public schools have a supply and they distribute them at need to the kids who come to school without bike lights or who request them through the principal's office.

897
01:14:14,591 --> 01:14:16,232
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's worked really well.

898
01:14:16,993 --> 01:14:19,055
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to put the bike lights

899
01:14:19,936 --> 01:14:20,517
[SPEAKER_01]: on the bikes.

900
01:14:20,937 --> 01:14:26,200
[SPEAKER_01]: I do that and, you know, there's only a certain percentage of success there.

901
01:14:26,661 --> 01:14:44,232
[SPEAKER_01]: With the helmets, it's trickier because we can't add to our event-related fitting of helmets a scenario of saying we're going to drop 25 helmets off at every public school for the principal's office to distribute to the teacher's pets.

902
01:14:45,553 --> 01:14:46,734
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to be fitted.

903
01:14:47,655 --> 01:14:49,156
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to not lose

904
01:14:50,458 --> 01:14:56,585
[SPEAKER_01]: that fact that bicycle helmets on kids should be fitted well by us.

905
01:14:57,085 --> 01:15:03,352
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we've been reserving it, or partially why, to events where we can do that.

906
01:15:04,333 --> 01:15:10,780
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a conversation with the parents, a guardian, fit the kid to a helmet, watch him smile, watch him ride a bike.

907
01:15:12,729 --> 01:15:14,930
[SPEAKER_01]: So with bike lights, it's been easier.

908
01:15:15,550 --> 01:15:29,717
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how to cross that bridge between a specific event where we fit helmets and free distribution through the schools or other less monitored activities.

909
01:15:31,420 --> 01:15:45,530
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's fair to say that we do distribute them at events where we have people on hand ready to make sure that the helmet fits and fit the straps and so forth and make sure that we have a, you know, we

910
01:15:46,560 --> 01:15:49,101
[SPEAKER_12]: We are talking to the parents at the same time.

911
01:15:49,121 --> 01:15:53,743
[SPEAKER_12]: We do show up at a number of events every year.

912
01:15:53,763 --> 01:16:04,266
[SPEAKER_01]: So start and we may be able to divest ourselves, one way to put it, of 200 helmets a year that way.

913
01:16:04,286 --> 01:16:07,168
[SPEAKER_01]: I have five or six events that we do.

914
01:16:07,288 --> 01:16:09,748
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe that's just the way we'll start this, right?

915
01:16:13,742 --> 01:16:18,146
[SPEAKER_12]: So I want to keep us moving along because we are going to get quite behind schedule.

916
01:16:19,827 --> 01:16:24,651
[SPEAKER_12]: And do so in the meantime, we need

917
01:16:26,513 --> 01:16:29,815
[SPEAKER_12]: We need people to go chasing down donors.

918
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:36,119
[SPEAKER_12]: We now have a idea of what the process looks like for getting the money turned into helmets.

919
01:16:37,840 --> 01:16:39,661
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we need to make a motion about this?

920
01:16:39,961 --> 01:16:47,746
[SPEAKER_12]: Is this something that we need just whoever has ideas about donors to talk to Ernie and form a working group?

921
01:16:50,095 --> 01:16:53,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we just start by confirming what's our initial order quantity?

922
01:16:53,918 --> 01:16:54,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, do we want to start small?

923
01:16:54,998 --> 01:16:56,480
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, Ernie, what were you thinking?

924
01:16:56,760 --> 01:16:57,080
[SPEAKER_04]: 50 helmets?

925
01:16:57,100 --> 01:17:01,203
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 to make sure we don't run out at one event.

926
01:17:01,843 --> 01:17:05,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, or 48 to round number for their cartons.

927
01:17:06,887 --> 01:17:08,368
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we've got a starting point.

928
01:17:09,909 --> 01:17:11,230
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a relatively small dollar.

929
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:13,311
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in the scheme of things, a small dollar.

930
01:17:13,772 --> 01:17:15,273
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about looking for $500 for 50 helmets rounded.

931
01:17:19,923 --> 01:17:21,304
[SPEAKER_01]: For what event, I don't know.

932
01:17:21,324 --> 01:17:24,365
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't synced it to our calendar for this fall.

933
01:17:26,666 --> 01:17:40,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I would be happy to continue with the helmet working group and working with Ernie to try to, to the extent that I can help identify some funding, come up with some options and try to get to the 500.

934
01:17:41,131 --> 01:17:45,853
[SPEAKER_01]: And is Noam on our working group as well?

935
01:17:45,973 --> 01:17:46,373
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget.

936
01:17:47,681 --> 01:17:48,482
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, no.

937
01:17:50,264 --> 01:17:50,925
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

938
01:17:52,987 --> 01:17:53,688
[SPEAKER_11]: Say that again.

939
01:17:54,049 --> 01:17:57,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Say again.

940
01:17:58,253 --> 01:18:00,136
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I am on to.

941
01:18:02,759 --> 01:18:06,102
[SPEAKER_12]: So, do we need to make a motion to ask the working group for helmets?

942
01:18:07,777 --> 01:18:11,418
[SPEAKER_12]: to go ahead and make the purchase if they identify the funding?

943
01:18:12,478 --> 01:18:17,320
[SPEAKER_12]: Or are they good to keep working on this and give us another update when they have one?

944
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:26,722
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, by making the purchase, that means notifying Alicia to make the actual purchase, even at this level?

945
01:18:26,742 --> 01:18:35,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Or will Alicia, for a $500 invoice, how are you going to pay Chris or me for buying them?

946
01:18:38,861 --> 01:18:46,304
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my point, is that actually we think that from looking at this company's website, Helmets R Us,

947
01:18:46,775 --> 01:18:50,197
[SPEAKER_08]: that they can take a purchase order and a check from the city.

948
01:18:50,337 --> 01:18:52,119
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm saying don't buy them.

949
01:18:52,439 --> 01:18:54,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell me you want to buy them.

950
01:18:54,680 --> 01:18:55,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.

951
01:18:55,141 --> 01:18:57,282
[SPEAKER_08]: And what the source of funding is.

952
01:18:57,302 --> 01:18:57,342
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

953
01:18:57,762 --> 01:18:59,023
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the city makes the purchase.

954
01:18:59,223 --> 01:19:08,850
[SPEAKER_01]: First order of 50 pieces, according to sizes and colors, I think won't embarrass too many little boys who are looking at a box of pink helmets.

955
01:19:09,490 --> 01:19:10,911
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll proceed.

956
01:19:10,931 --> 01:19:12,012
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

957
01:19:12,052 --> 01:19:13,393
[SPEAKER_08]: They had an order form.

958
01:19:13,593 --> 01:19:15,114
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was pretty clear like you could

959
01:19:16,046 --> 01:19:19,208
[SPEAKER_08]: even fill that out with like what it is you want to buy.

960
01:19:19,228 --> 01:19:20,048
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

961
01:19:21,950 --> 01:19:22,150
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

962
01:19:22,310 --> 01:19:22,610
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

963
01:19:22,650 --> 01:19:27,873
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, the helmet working group can continue with their work.

964
01:19:28,574 --> 01:19:42,082
[SPEAKER_15]: Do we need to authorize anything specifically for them to authorize them to ask Alicia to purchase approximately 400 or 48 helmets or whatever the number is at rounds appropriately.

965
01:19:42,902 --> 01:19:45,604
[SPEAKER_12]: Assuming they find the funding for it because that's the,

966
01:19:46,138 --> 01:19:46,438
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

967
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:48,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we have a second?

968
01:19:51,804 --> 01:19:52,225
[SPEAKER_12]: Second.

969
01:19:53,466 --> 01:19:54,027
[SPEAKER_12]: All in favor?

970
01:19:55,068 --> 01:19:55,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

971
01:19:56,089 --> 01:19:56,950
[SPEAKER_12]: Opposed?

972
01:19:59,293 --> 01:20:00,054
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, everybody.

973
01:20:00,094 --> 01:20:01,115
[SPEAKER_12]: That motion passes.

974
01:20:02,837 --> 01:20:05,139
[SPEAKER_12]: And the helmet working group will continue working on helmets.

975
01:20:07,682 --> 01:20:11,265
[SPEAKER_12]: Next up, we have infrastructure updates.

976
01:20:11,706 --> 01:20:13,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Hoping Todd is here, which he is not.

977
01:20:15,408 --> 01:20:19,111
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a question about Clippership Connector access update.

978
01:20:21,453 --> 01:20:23,935
[SPEAKER_12]: I assume that we have all written on the Clippership Connector now.

979
01:20:27,958 --> 01:20:33,863
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't... Question, because I'm actually the main contact with the state for the Clippership Connector.

980
01:20:34,878 --> 01:20:38,180
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I think about, I'm not sure.

981
01:20:38,220 --> 01:20:42,542
[SPEAKER_12]: I just see Clippership Connector access update with a question mark.

982
01:20:44,423 --> 01:20:53,087
[SPEAKER_12]: And I assume that means the spot where there's still like construction access and maybe whether that will be another point of access.

983
01:20:53,167 --> 01:20:58,210
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it was primarily the, the Clippership Drive Main Street, um,

984
01:20:59,787 --> 01:21:01,688
[SPEAKER_15]: interface, possible signal, et cetera.

985
01:21:02,108 --> 01:21:07,789
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why Todd needs to be involved because he was going to present what's happening with the Contra Flow Lane, et cetera.

986
01:21:08,269 --> 01:21:09,650
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what we're waiting for on that.

987
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:15,671
[SPEAKER_08]: The last update that I got on that, so it was approved by the Traffic Commission to do it.

988
01:21:16,811 --> 01:21:26,014
[SPEAKER_08]: But it is actually a real construction project because there are bump outs that need to get, sidewalk bump outs that actually need to get cut back.

989
01:21:26,726 --> 01:21:30,768
[SPEAKER_08]: in order to create it so it's not just a paint and signal thing.

990
01:21:31,429 --> 01:21:36,632
[SPEAKER_08]: And when I asked Todd about timelines, he was talking next spring at the earliest.

991
01:21:38,993 --> 01:21:40,274
[SPEAKER_11]: OK, thanks.

992
01:21:40,994 --> 01:21:41,955
[SPEAKER_11]: But keep asking him.

993
01:21:42,575 --> 01:21:43,616
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that answers that.

994
01:21:47,726 --> 01:21:55,311
[SPEAKER_12]: Looking down here, I see review of goals, priorities, procedures, et cetera, budget proposals.

995
01:21:56,012 --> 01:21:59,714
[SPEAKER_15]: Emily, you had asked me to add a door zone bike lane question.

996
01:22:01,296 --> 01:22:01,556
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

997
01:22:02,316 --> 01:22:03,137
[SPEAKER_12]: On our initial.

998
01:22:03,737 --> 01:22:08,361
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and I was thinking that might be under the review of goals, priorities, et cetera.

999
01:22:08,421 --> 01:22:11,062
[SPEAKER_12]: Although, since I see that some of this was Daniel.

1000
01:22:13,563 --> 01:22:14,824
[SPEAKER_12]: But thank you for that reminder.

1001
01:22:14,844 --> 01:22:27,387
[SPEAKER_12]: I had a question that I'm wondering if we want to take a position on, which is the question of door zone bike lanes.

1002
01:22:28,107 --> 01:22:31,368
[SPEAKER_12]: There are a bunch of places in Medford where

1003
01:22:32,478 --> 01:22:43,603
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, we've ended up with a compromise situation where you have the seven-foot parking, five-foot bike lane, 10-foot travel lane situation.

1004
01:22:43,663 --> 01:22:45,023
[SPEAKER_12]: Boston Ave is one of those.

1005
01:22:46,724 --> 01:22:51,666
[SPEAKER_12]: And that ends up being something that looks like you have a bike lane.

1006
01:22:52,366 --> 01:22:57,088
[SPEAKER_12]: But in reality, that bike lane is really not safe to use.

1007
01:22:57,648 --> 01:23:00,590
[SPEAKER_12]: It means that the entire bike lane is the door zone.

1008
01:23:01,729 --> 01:23:10,795
[SPEAKER_12]: Vehicles that are wider than seven feet don't even fit in that seven feet and many of them are and that's already assuming that everybody parks all the way to the curb, which they don't.

1009
01:23:12,997 --> 01:23:19,842
[SPEAKER_12]: And with a five foot bike lane sandwiched in between a seven foot parking lane and a 10 foot travel lane.

1010
01:23:20,980 --> 01:23:26,485
[SPEAKER_12]: you can't possibly use that bike lane and expect it to actually be a safe place to be.

1011
01:23:27,886 --> 01:23:35,972
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is a situation that we end up with in order to not take away parking, and it's considered a compromise.

1012
01:23:36,052 --> 01:23:40,196
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is sort of like, this is how we put a compromise in that makes everybody happy.

1013
01:23:40,216 --> 01:23:41,157
[SPEAKER_12]: And this,

1014
01:23:44,159 --> 01:23:54,245
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think this is something that maybe when the Boston and Ave bike lanes initially went in, maybe made some sense because we didn't have any other bike lanes in Medford or very few.

1015
01:23:54,265 --> 01:24:02,570
[SPEAKER_12]: And having some paint on the road that looks like a bike lane at least makes it clear that you should be in the street and not on the sidewalk.

1016
01:24:03,731 --> 01:24:09,495
[SPEAKER_12]: But that was 10 years ago, and the vehicles are wider now in addition.

1017
01:24:10,700 --> 01:24:17,625
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have more people on bikes, more awareness that at least you're probably not supposed to be on the sidewalk and so forth.

1018
01:24:18,185 --> 01:24:28,552
[SPEAKER_12]: So my question for the commission is, do we want to make a state a position about door zone bike lanes?

1019
01:24:28,652 --> 01:24:32,114
[SPEAKER_12]: And in a case where you don't have more room,

1020
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:59,990
[SPEAKER_12]: to make that bike lane wider or make that parking wider, would we rather have Sharos or Super Sharos or something else instead of that door zone bike lane, even if it means we can't have a bike lane, if that parking lane is not going to be removed or if we can't get the parking removed, would we prefer that door zone bike lane or would we prefer to have no bike lane at all?

1021
01:25:01,090 --> 01:25:12,260
[SPEAKER_12]: And my personal feeling is that in this case, if we can't have a bike lane that's actually safe to use, then we shouldn't put in a bike lane.

1022
01:25:13,482 --> 01:25:15,343
[SPEAKER_12]: Having a bike lane that's not safe to use

1023
01:25:16,324 --> 01:25:20,109
[SPEAKER_12]: just means that we encourage people to ride someplace that they shouldn't.

1024
01:25:20,609 --> 01:25:31,242
[SPEAKER_12]: And we also encourage drivers to get mad at you for using the full lane because they think you should be in the bike lane and they don't care or know whether or not it's safe.

1025
01:25:31,943 --> 01:25:34,364
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's my question.

1026
01:25:34,404 --> 01:25:36,364
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a thing that comes up a lot.

1027
01:25:36,404 --> 01:25:38,364
[SPEAKER_12]: You see these in a lot of places around here.

1028
01:25:38,384 --> 01:25:39,385
[SPEAKER_12]: We have them in Medford.

1029
01:25:41,445 --> 01:25:47,986
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I think it may be worth some discussion and taking a position on this.

1030
01:25:49,167 --> 01:25:50,667
[SPEAKER_12]: Ernie, I saw your hand up first, I think.

1031
01:25:51,287 --> 01:25:59,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I'm going to ask Bruce, who maybe has more experience biking in many more locales internationally.

1032
01:26:00,249 --> 01:26:03,432
[SPEAKER_01]: The then me what is the technical?

1033
01:26:03,853 --> 01:26:06,615
[SPEAKER_01]: Fleshing out of the options here.

1034
01:26:07,396 --> 01:26:23,670
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking that you could have shark's teeth foot wide 18 inch wide buffer zones between the painting of a bike lane and the beginning of a parking space and

1035
01:26:23,985 --> 01:26:27,370
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of a no man's land for the door to be opened.

1036
01:26:27,951 --> 01:26:36,323
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that established minimum that might be prevalent someplace else can't be had, then Emily's right.

1037
01:26:36,778 --> 01:26:43,320
[SPEAKER_01]: don't even bother to try, because a too narrow bike lane is an invitation to disaster.

1038
01:26:43,721 --> 01:26:58,686
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there a standard augmented bike lane with door zone or other narrowish hazard model that's in place elsewhere or in care?

1039
01:26:59,166 --> 01:26:59,586
[SPEAKER_01]: Useful?

1040
01:27:02,178 --> 01:27:19,425
[SPEAKER_12]: Ernie, there are bike lanes in this area that have a buffer, and there are cases of a painted buffer between the bike lane and the parking lane, and in some cases also between the bike lane and the travel lane, and that does exist.

1041
01:27:20,045 --> 01:27:23,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they standardized enough so that people would know what they're for?

1042
01:27:23,994 --> 01:27:24,894
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, yes.

1043
01:27:25,274 --> 01:27:30,015
[SPEAKER_12]: But the question is, what do you do when you don't have enough space for that?

1044
01:27:30,416 --> 01:27:31,596
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then you can't have anything.

1045
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:34,456
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree.

1046
01:27:34,596 --> 01:27:44,779
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's really what I wanted to bring up, is in places where there's enough room to have a buffer that creates that space between here's where you bike

1047
01:27:45,479 --> 01:27:52,127
[SPEAKER_12]: here's some, as Ernie put it, no man's land where the car door might end up, and here's where the parked cars go.

1048
01:27:52,147 --> 01:28:03,480
[SPEAKER_12]: That's one thing, but if you don't actually have enough space for that, is it better to put in a bad bike lane than no bike lane, or is it better to have no bike lane than a bad bike lane?

1049
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:05,082
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's my question.

1050
01:28:05,282 --> 01:28:05,542
[SPEAKER_12]: Bruce?

1051
01:28:06,246 --> 01:28:10,249
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so just a couple of clarifications regarding Boston Avenue.

1052
01:28:10,369 --> 01:28:14,772
[SPEAKER_15]: Are you referring to the whole distance or specific blocks?

1053
01:28:15,792 --> 01:28:17,534
[SPEAKER_15]: Just so I understand the context.

1054
01:28:20,599 --> 01:28:23,220
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm looking for some of the photos that I've taken.

1055
01:28:23,240 --> 01:28:34,504
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't use the part between Winthrop Street and Route 16 all that often, so I don't have photos of it.

1056
01:28:34,764 --> 01:28:38,826
[SPEAKER_12]: I used to live in West Medford, and I used to go that way all the time, and I don't as much now.

1057
01:28:40,266 --> 01:28:47,749
[SPEAKER_12]: But the part definitely between Winthrop Street and College Ave

1058
01:28:49,334 --> 01:28:53,776
[SPEAKER_12]: has quite a lot of parking utilization during the day.

1059
01:28:53,796 --> 01:28:58,698
[SPEAKER_12]: I think some of it is because of construction workers parking there.

1060
01:28:58,758 --> 01:29:01,039
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of it I think is MBTA workers parking there.

1061
01:29:01,079 --> 01:29:03,260
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of it might be Tufts employees.

1062
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:05,101
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's a lot of people coming and going.

1063
01:29:05,141 --> 01:29:06,241
[SPEAKER_12]: They open the doors a lot.

1064
01:29:06,321 --> 01:29:09,603
[SPEAKER_12]: I think there's a fair number of people who actually take their lunch break sitting in their car.

1065
01:29:10,563 --> 01:29:11,944
[SPEAKER_12]: while it's parked on Boston Ave.

1066
01:29:13,165 --> 01:29:19,750
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's the stretch that I have the photos of.

1067
01:29:20,490 --> 01:29:28,837
[SPEAKER_12]: But the other part of Boston Ave is a similar configuration where I think it's a 10-foot.

1068
01:29:29,177 --> 01:29:34,621
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a lot of experience riding Boston Avenue all the way from High Street to College Avenue.

1069
01:29:36,688 --> 01:29:56,554
[SPEAKER_15]: I do find that the lane on the lower, I guess maybe it's the upper part, towards High Street is narrow, but does offer sufficient space, being aware of the possibility of dooring, which is the case even when we don't have bike lanes.

1070
01:29:56,594 --> 01:30:04,257
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'll put that out there, that putting the bike lane in or not, I don't think for an inexperienced rider has

1071
01:30:05,450 --> 01:30:08,572
[SPEAKER_15]: much effect on the possibility of touring.

1072
01:30:09,153 --> 01:30:11,795
[SPEAKER_15]: In fact, if anything, the bike lane might increase that.

1073
01:30:12,656 --> 01:30:13,496
[SPEAKER_15]: That's hard to say.

1074
01:30:13,516 --> 01:30:20,261
[SPEAKER_15]: I will definitely say that if the roadway has any sort of a downhill,

1075
01:30:21,323 --> 01:30:30,691
[SPEAKER_15]: in that area, that configuration is absolutely inappropriate, as we've seen on the downhill side of Boston Avenue, where we've chosen to put in sharrows.

1076
01:30:31,271 --> 01:30:43,221
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's because simply any inexperienced cyclist can get up to 18 or 20 miles an hour without breaking a sweat, and that becomes extremely dangerous to be in a door zone at that speed.

1077
01:30:44,276 --> 01:30:53,547
[SPEAKER_15]: On the uphill side, on the other hand, cyclists, including myself, are often going significantly slower, 8-10 miles an hour, and therefore the

1078
01:30:55,073 --> 01:31:00,696
[SPEAKER_15]: the notion of being in the way, which some people are uncomfortable with, is higher.

1079
01:31:02,097 --> 01:31:10,522
[SPEAKER_15]: And it would mean that without a bike lane, there's things we could use to mitigate it.

1080
01:31:10,542 --> 01:31:16,165
[SPEAKER_15]: But you would be out in traffic more, going slower, which does become uncomfortable for a lot of people.

1081
01:31:17,225 --> 01:31:22,668
[SPEAKER_15]: and for motor vehicle operators who feel they don't have enough room and don't know that they can cross the line.

1082
01:31:22,728 --> 01:31:27,471
[SPEAKER_15]: And of course, at rush hour, you can't really cross the line on Boston Avenue because there's too much traffic.

1083
01:31:28,392 --> 01:31:41,379
[SPEAKER_15]: So one of the other points is that if there are no bike lanes put in, then the default configuration is to center the yellow line so that there's equal amount of space.

1084
01:31:42,340 --> 01:31:46,082
[SPEAKER_15]: However, if you were to leave the line where it is currently,

1085
01:31:47,517 --> 01:31:54,299
[SPEAKER_15]: and not provide a bike lane, you would effectively have a 14-foot lane on one side and a 10-foot lane on the other side.

1086
01:31:55,319 --> 01:32:01,500
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks funny, but I'm not quite sure what that would do.

1087
01:32:01,620 --> 01:32:10,402
[SPEAKER_15]: So the real question here is, given the lack of space, what does the paint actually do or not do?

1088
01:32:11,923 --> 01:32:16,284
[SPEAKER_15]: And is it really more dangerous to have an uphill bike lane

1089
01:32:17,510 --> 01:32:20,292
[SPEAKER_15]: at that location than nothing at all.

1090
01:32:21,413 --> 01:32:24,595
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm torn and you know how I feel about a lot of bad infrastructure.

1091
01:32:27,207 --> 01:32:27,467
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

1092
01:32:27,868 --> 01:32:29,629
[SPEAKER_12]: I found the picture that I wanted to share.

1093
01:32:29,649 --> 01:32:29,689
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

1094
01:32:30,470 --> 01:32:35,434
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, and by the way, the area where the construction is is a whole other deal.

1095
01:32:35,875 --> 01:32:39,018
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think we should even bother talking about that.

1096
01:32:39,158 --> 01:32:40,119
[SPEAKER_12]: That's another story.

1097
01:32:40,939 --> 01:32:44,623
[SPEAKER_12]: The actual construction project, especially since that's temporary.

1098
01:32:45,924 --> 01:32:49,287
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is the photo that I wanted to share.

1099
01:32:49,447 --> 01:32:52,890
[SPEAKER_12]: If you notice right here, this car door is just about to open.

1100
01:32:54,311 --> 01:33:01,397
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have another photo right next to this one where I think that door did open.

1101
01:33:02,518 --> 01:33:11,746
[SPEAKER_12]: And you see this person riding here who just barely missed getting hit by that car door.

1102
01:33:13,417 --> 01:33:19,201
[SPEAKER_15]: I will say- You were completely stopped prior to this because you either knew the door was opening or you staged this?

1103
01:33:20,041 --> 01:33:23,444
[SPEAKER_12]: Where did this come from?

1104
01:33:23,464 --> 01:33:29,048
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I stopped because there were so many- It was fortuitous that the door opened.

1105
01:33:29,068 --> 01:33:33,151
[SPEAKER_12]: I had stopped basically because there was that vehicle up here.

1106
01:33:34,292 --> 01:33:42,417
[SPEAKER_12]: the bike lane, and I was going to just take a picture of, you know, I'll look at this row of cars blocking the bike lane, and if anybody opens their door, somebody's in trouble.

1107
01:33:43,338 --> 01:33:46,239
[SPEAKER_12]: And then this other cyclist rode by, and then the door opened.

1108
01:33:48,060 --> 01:33:54,684
[SPEAKER_12]: And so this is a case in particular where a lot of tough students ride here.

1109
01:33:55,205 --> 01:33:58,166
[SPEAKER_12]: They see the paint on the ground, and they think that's where they're supposed to be.

1110
01:33:58,187 --> 01:33:59,868
[SPEAKER_12]: And not only that.

1111
01:34:00,848 --> 01:34:06,410
[SPEAKER_12]: I get yelled at on a fairly regular basis for not being in the bike lane in this spot.

1112
01:34:07,651 --> 01:34:22,537
[SPEAKER_12]: And so part of my objection to a bike lane that is inherently not a safe place to be is that it makes people think that they have to be in it

1113
01:34:23,817 --> 01:34:25,438
[SPEAKER_12]: even if it's not a safe place to be.

1114
01:34:25,458 --> 01:34:27,760
[SPEAKER_15]: Kind of like the rotary situation we discussed earlier.

1115
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:28,661
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, exactly.

1116
01:34:28,781 --> 01:34:31,463
[SPEAKER_12]: And it also makes drivers think that they have to be in it.

1117
01:34:31,623 --> 01:34:40,851
[SPEAKER_12]: And so you have somebody where somebody thinks that that's maybe not a good place to be, and they're not really sure or they're not that confident.

1118
01:34:41,551 --> 01:34:44,552
[SPEAKER_12]: And they get yelled at, hey, you're breaking the law.

1119
01:34:44,572 --> 01:34:46,813
[SPEAKER_12]: You're supposed to be in the bike lane, which is not true.

1120
01:34:49,633 --> 01:34:51,154
[SPEAKER_12]: But that's what they hear.

1121
01:34:51,414 --> 01:34:54,115
[SPEAKER_12]: And then from then on, they think they must have been wrong.

1122
01:34:54,855 --> 01:34:57,736
[SPEAKER_12]: Now they go back and use that bike lane and they get doored.

1123
01:34:58,376 --> 01:35:00,957
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's not as big a problem at

1124
01:35:02,037 --> 01:35:06,040
[SPEAKER_12]: at low speeds if you're going uphill, but you can still get doored uphill.

1125
01:35:06,521 --> 01:35:11,685
[SPEAKER_12]: And you can also still get yelled at for not wanting to ride in the door zone uphill.

1126
01:35:12,306 --> 01:35:23,795
[SPEAKER_12]: And so my concern with this configuration is five feet plus seven feet is 12 feet between the edge of the bike lane and the curb.

1127
01:35:23,815 --> 01:35:26,598
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's- I think it's only four feet for the bike lane as well.

1128
01:35:27,490 --> 01:35:30,899
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I think it's five counting to the outside of the white lines.

1129
01:35:31,040 --> 01:35:31,441
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I see.

1130
01:35:31,481 --> 01:35:31,601
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

1131
01:35:32,722 --> 01:35:40,147
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, but that, that is 12 feet for a parked car and a person on a bike.

1132
01:35:40,987 --> 01:35:48,732
[SPEAKER_12]: And if that's adjacent to a 10 foot parking, a 10 foot travel lane, and it could have a city bus in it, that's 10 feet wide.

1133
01:35:49,712 --> 01:35:51,514
[SPEAKER_12]: That's inherently not enough space.

1134
01:35:51,634 --> 01:35:58,458
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we shouldn't put paint on the ground that says that makes it look like it's enough space or makes people think that there's space when.

1135
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:02,022
[SPEAKER_15]: So I want, I want to be clear about what your proposal would be.

1136
01:36:02,042 --> 01:36:12,489
[SPEAKER_15]: You would want us to have a minimum set of width that before we recommend a bike lane, otherwise we would recommend share us.

1137
01:36:13,009 --> 01:36:13,249
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1138
01:36:13,869 --> 01:36:14,050
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1139
01:36:14,450 --> 01:36:17,932
[SPEAKER_12]: That's, that's my, that's where, that's where I'm coming from.

1140
01:36:18,292 --> 01:36:19,053
[SPEAKER_12]: Chris, I saw your hand up.

1141
01:36:19,924 --> 01:36:23,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think it's a really good discussion.

1142
01:36:24,668 --> 01:36:31,214
[SPEAKER_04]: And I ride my kid to school every day of the last year up and down Boston.

1143
01:36:31,234 --> 01:36:32,655
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a couple of thoughts.

1144
01:36:32,695 --> 01:36:38,180
[SPEAKER_04]: And Bruce, you bring some really good points about width and hills make a big difference in these decisions.

1145
01:36:38,260 --> 01:36:41,102
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not hard to be totally

1146
01:36:42,263 --> 01:36:43,344
[SPEAKER_04]: one size fits all with this.

1147
01:36:44,724 --> 01:36:49,666
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing to consider is a lot of e-bikes are going to be going really fast uphill.

1148
01:36:50,207 --> 01:37:02,852
[SPEAKER_04]: So depending on how much boost you could be crushing 20, although class ones are going to top out at 20 miles per hour, it's pretty hard to do uphill, but then you've got the class twos that can go even more than that.

1149
01:37:04,013 --> 01:37:05,714
[SPEAKER_04]: So speed can be a factor uphill.

1150
01:37:06,194 --> 01:37:08,175
[SPEAKER_04]: Which technically you shouldn't be in the bike lane, but.

1151
01:37:09,595 --> 01:37:10,656
[SPEAKER_04]: Agreed, you should not be, but.

1152
01:37:12,117 --> 01:37:15,781
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do most of my riding, I do it on my bike and I do it on our cargo bike.

1153
01:37:17,242 --> 01:37:21,927
[SPEAKER_04]: I always use that bike lane and I feel more protected being in it.

1154
01:37:22,588 --> 01:37:28,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I will often ride on the outside edge of it, being wary of doors.

1155
01:37:29,514 --> 01:37:35,038
[SPEAKER_04]: And I feel pretty comfortable that I'm safe and can anticipate when that's going to happen.

1156
01:37:35,258 --> 01:37:38,920
[SPEAKER_04]: And if a door is starting to open, I can nudge out into traffic a little more.

1157
01:37:39,040 --> 01:37:44,184
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's ever a scenario where a car is parked a little further out, I can anticipate it, go out into the road a little bit.

1158
01:37:44,244 --> 01:37:45,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no problem taking that space.

1159
01:37:46,165 --> 01:37:48,406
[SPEAKER_04]: that's obviously not happening across the board.

1160
01:37:49,547 --> 01:37:56,331
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I appreciate about having the bike lane painted there is it tells cars you cannot go there.

1161
01:37:57,052 --> 01:38:01,094
[SPEAKER_04]: So it at least gives you a safe space all the way up to the edge of the line.

1162
01:38:01,254 --> 01:38:05,097
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't have any problem straddling that and going into the lane a little bit.

1163
01:38:05,377 --> 01:38:07,538
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm a little reluctant to give up that.

1164
01:38:07,698 --> 01:38:13,702
[SPEAKER_04]: If you took the bike lane away from Boston Ave, I'd be a lot more nervous biking my kids up and down it.

1165
01:38:14,763 --> 01:38:16,485
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel pretty good having that there.

1166
01:38:16,505 --> 01:38:21,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's not perfect, and I wish there was a better way to signal.

1167
01:38:22,393 --> 01:38:29,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe the bike lane needs to be narrower with a striped line, like stay out of this right side of it.

1168
01:38:31,991 --> 01:38:34,552
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that I would jump on board, don't have it at all.

1169
01:38:35,252 --> 01:38:42,134
[SPEAKER_12]: And I will say, before we moved, I lived in West Medford, and then I did bike up Boston Ave every day.

1170
01:38:42,994 --> 01:38:47,015
[SPEAKER_12]: And I was living there at the point when that bike lane got painted.

1171
01:38:47,035 --> 01:38:50,736
[SPEAKER_12]: And I agree, it really did make a big difference.

1172
01:38:50,856 --> 01:38:54,557
[SPEAKER_12]: I had better experiences on that road after it went in.

1173
01:38:54,577 --> 01:38:58,378
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the biggest difference is the yellow line has moved left.

1174
01:38:59,838 --> 01:39:06,726
[SPEAKER_15]: And so the lane is effectively wider with or without the bike lane.

1175
01:39:06,866 --> 01:39:11,031
[SPEAKER_12]: And there is the argument that the bike lane being there makes the lane look visually narrower.

1176
01:39:11,131 --> 01:39:14,776
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's theoretically supposed to provide a traffic calming effect as well.

1177
01:39:15,016 --> 01:39:15,417
[SPEAKER_04]: It does.

1178
01:39:17,619 --> 01:39:19,782
[SPEAKER_12]: So Anna, I saw your hand up.

1179
01:39:21,033 --> 01:39:25,495
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, my experience is also totally anecdotal from my own writing.

1180
01:39:25,995 --> 01:39:32,997
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would be curious if there's any research out there, I haven't done it, on what Sharrows actually do for people.

1181
01:39:33,037 --> 01:39:38,399
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I find that when I'm riding on roads with Sharrows, they're there and no one gives a single crap about them.

1182
01:39:38,479 --> 01:39:45,782
[SPEAKER_10]: And I ride up and down Main Street a lot, and granted it is narrower, but people are whipping by me all the time, not leaving that much space.

1183
01:39:47,182 --> 01:39:53,946
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I find that riding up Main Street or riding on Boston Ave, I feel much safer on Boston Ave with that lane even.

1184
01:39:53,966 --> 01:39:59,128
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with what Chris is saying of being wary of doors and being more on the outside edge.

1185
01:40:00,589 --> 01:40:11,255
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I would be curious to know more about Sharrows and any research done on how much people actually follow them in a way that I do think cars follow and stay out of the bike lane.

1186
01:40:13,876 --> 01:40:14,917
[SPEAKER_11]: Adam, I saw your hand up.

1187
01:40:19,309 --> 01:40:36,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, other comments I wanted to make is that I think having a bike lane can remind people who have just parked their car or like getting in their car or are about to open their door in any case that there might be bikes coming by.

1188
01:40:36,200 --> 01:40:39,503
[SPEAKER_06]: There's like an indication that like, oh yeah, bikes go here.

1189
01:40:43,045 --> 01:40:45,067
[SPEAKER_06]: But I, yeah, I don't.

1190
01:40:47,088 --> 01:40:49,209
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think there's a perfect solution.

1191
01:40:51,389 --> 01:40:59,551
[SPEAKER_06]: As me, I agree with what you're proposing as just me as a bike rider.

1192
01:40:59,651 --> 01:41:12,795
[SPEAKER_06]: But as me riding with my kid to Davis Square, I'm happy that that bike lane on Boston Avenue, for example, is there.

1193
01:41:14,608 --> 01:41:24,971
[SPEAKER_06]: And also kind of the, I think what we've been talking about before, like if you're coming back from, uh, Davis going up college at, I liked that there's a bike lane going uphill.

1194
01:41:25,051 --> 01:41:26,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause we're going well.

1195
01:41:27,492 --> 01:41:29,292
[SPEAKER_06]: And that feels better.

1196
01:41:29,312 --> 01:41:38,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, but in any case, I I'm saying that I think direction makes a difference.

1197
01:41:39,615 --> 01:41:42,916
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with that sentiment that other people have expressed.

1198
01:41:43,647 --> 01:41:52,149
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know when that bike lane went in originally, we did make a point of telling them that we wanted it on the uphill side and not the downhill side, if it was only going to be one or the other.

1199
01:41:52,169 --> 01:41:52,889
[SPEAKER_06]: Mm-hmm.

1200
01:41:53,589 --> 01:41:55,350
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes sense.

1201
01:41:55,450 --> 01:41:55,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1202
01:41:55,810 --> 01:41:57,810
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing I wanted to say was, why not?

1203
01:41:58,070 --> 01:42:01,531
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, sharrows might not work that well, but why not both?

1204
01:42:01,631 --> 01:42:06,733
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not put the bike lane in, but also put the sharrow in the middle of the road?

1205
01:42:06,753 --> 01:42:11,114
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it doesn't cost a lot to do that.

1206
01:42:14,100 --> 01:42:14,320
[SPEAKER_12]: Ernie?

1207
01:42:14,980 --> 01:42:20,041
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, then you make the bike lane marker dotted line showing that it's an option.

1208
01:42:20,081 --> 01:42:20,781
[SPEAKER_01]: That's interesting.

1209
01:42:21,221 --> 01:42:33,484
[SPEAKER_01]: Going back to what Bruce was saying about asymmetry of car lanes as a function of bike lanes, that you should be, if you get rid of them and just go to shadows, that you should repaint the center line.

1210
01:42:33,844 --> 01:42:35,124
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not so sure about that.

1211
01:42:35,864 --> 01:42:38,385
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that if it's uphill or downhill,

1212
01:42:40,212 --> 01:42:42,235
[SPEAKER_01]: has an interesting effect there.

1213
01:42:42,796 --> 01:42:55,556
[SPEAKER_01]: And in general, for the other reasons that we stated, we should maybe ensure that there's a wide bike lane on the uphill side and then go to shadows downhill in general.

1214
01:42:56,076 --> 01:43:11,631
[SPEAKER_01]: and maybe make the width of the bike lane differential as to how severe that hill is, or the local speed zone of congestion there.

1215
01:43:12,132 --> 01:43:20,260
[SPEAKER_01]: The example you picked, Emily, that photo, is showing the minimum for the identification of a bike lane.

1216
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:22,861
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is hazardous to use.

1217
01:43:22,921 --> 01:43:27,884
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't warn anybody in a car that there's anything there like a bike lane.

1218
01:43:27,984 --> 01:43:31,386
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just another line painted three feet away.

1219
01:43:31,927 --> 01:43:48,397
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm thinking that if we ever want to institute bike lanes in these situations, especially uphill, that they be super bike lanes painted green, have extra wide striping, a signage, something or other, because

1220
01:43:49,858 --> 01:43:57,704
[SPEAKER_01]: If I were dooring or being doored in the example that you showed, and I think that was a flat place of Boston Avenue.

1221
01:43:57,724 --> 01:43:58,305
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1222
01:43:58,705 --> 01:43:59,006
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1223
01:43:59,446 --> 01:44:06,912
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say, ah, geez, this is a half-assed attempt at doing it right, and it didn't succeed.

1224
01:44:07,953 --> 01:44:17,583
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there are variables here that have to do with downhill, uphill, congestion, speed, and diameter of the street.

1225
01:44:18,263 --> 01:44:27,272
[SPEAKER_12]: They all have to be taken- The diameter of the street is the thing where if the road width is enough, then you can put in plenty of buffer and it's fine.

1226
01:44:28,513 --> 01:44:36,040
[SPEAKER_12]: And what I'm talking about is here, where we now have a four-foot passing law, for example.

1227
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:38,322
[SPEAKER_12]: And theoretically, that still applies.

1228
01:44:38,382 --> 01:44:41,264
[SPEAKER_12]: If you're in a bike lane, they're still supposed to pass you with four feet.

1229
01:44:42,165 --> 01:44:50,492
[SPEAKER_12]: And if you figure that a person on a bicycle is roughly 30 inches wide, and a lot of the time, it's actually wider.

1230
01:44:50,532 --> 01:44:52,054
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of mountain bike handlebars

1231
01:44:52,694 --> 01:44:53,494
[SPEAKER_12]: are wider than that.

1232
01:44:53,574 --> 01:44:55,575
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot of cruiser bike handlebars are wider than that.

1233
01:44:55,655 --> 01:44:57,035
[SPEAKER_12]: Panniers can be wider than that.

1234
01:44:57,455 --> 01:45:00,096
[SPEAKER_12]: A large person with their elbows sticking out is wider than that.

1235
01:45:00,776 --> 01:45:06,097
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you say a person on a bike is 30 inches, that's a little bit under three feet.

1236
01:45:07,438 --> 01:45:11,899
[SPEAKER_12]: And a minimum bike lane is five feet, and a parking lane is seven feet.

1237
01:45:13,099 --> 01:45:15,920
[SPEAKER_12]: If you need three feet to stay away from that car door,

1238
01:45:16,816 --> 01:45:19,158
[SPEAKER_12]: that I have, but- You are already hanging out.

1239
01:45:19,338 --> 01:45:28,104
[SPEAKER_12]: If a car door is three feet and they're parked right up to the edge of that bike lane, then you get two feet left and you're wider than two feet.

1240
01:45:28,364 --> 01:45:33,227
[SPEAKER_12]: And your travel lane that's next to you is 10 feet and you can have 10 foot vehicles in it.

1241
01:45:33,968 --> 01:45:40,032
[SPEAKER_12]: So this isn't a question for what should we do if there's actually lots of room to play with.

1242
01:45:40,692 --> 01:45:45,055
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a question of, is this necessarily

1243
01:45:46,136 --> 01:45:55,546
[SPEAKER_12]: the thing to paint in these situations where there is not mathematically enough room for these people to be on this space at the same time.

1244
01:45:55,867 --> 01:45:56,888
[SPEAKER_12]: Bruce?

1245
01:45:56,928 --> 01:46:00,872
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I think that I understand your dimensions, and I've looked through them myself.

1246
01:46:01,513 --> 01:46:07,359
[SPEAKER_15]: I think, practically speaking, in an urban environment like Boston and Medford in particular,

1247
01:46:08,405 --> 01:46:17,173
[SPEAKER_15]: That is not a practical set of criteria for deciding whether or not a bike lane fits, because we just do not have the room, period.

1248
01:46:18,114 --> 01:46:24,099
[SPEAKER_15]: I always contrast it to what it would look like without the bike lane there.

1249
01:46:24,739 --> 01:46:28,222
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm going to have to say that I can't support your

1250
01:46:29,363 --> 01:46:42,214
[SPEAKER_15]: minimum concept that you're putting forth because I think what would end up happening is it would end up getting painted in a symmetrical way, thereby narrowing the uphill lane significantly and making it worse.

1251
01:46:42,875 --> 01:46:48,860
[SPEAKER_15]: The only thing that you've really put forth as a potential safety hazard

1252
01:46:49,741 --> 01:47:04,056
[SPEAKER_15]: is people who are not aware of the door zone and do not ride accordingly and that is not going to change actually if a bike lane is taken out because people will not ride in a narrow lane

1253
01:47:05,337 --> 01:47:13,422
[SPEAKER_15]: out where we think they ought to, because they're afraid of harassment, they're afraid of getting hit, they're just not playing comfortable with it, etc.

1254
01:47:14,083 --> 01:47:24,510
[SPEAKER_15]: And so I think that even though it is not ideal, I don't think we have much of a choice but to go with the absolute minimums, which is what we've done in this situation.

1255
01:47:24,990 --> 01:47:31,755
[SPEAKER_15]: So I've got to say at this point, I can't support this, if it would be a resolution, I can't support

1256
01:47:32,895 --> 01:47:40,221
[SPEAKER_15]: going that route and saying that we should only recommend them when we have a certain amount of width, otherwise we'll put sharrows in.

1257
01:47:42,642 --> 01:47:42,962
[SPEAKER_12]: Chris?

1258
01:47:43,983 --> 01:47:44,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1259
01:47:45,902 --> 01:47:48,664
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think this is a really useful conversation.

1260
01:47:48,704 --> 01:47:49,785
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no easy answers here.

1261
01:47:49,945 --> 01:47:57,711
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think I'm just reading what Adam put here in the chat, which is these urban design guidelines.

1262
01:47:57,791 --> 01:48:08,298
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm wondering if maybe instead of taking a sort of binary position of like, we don't want this, maybe we do a little bit of follow-up homework of what other

1263
01:48:09,239 --> 01:48:37,417
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of urban guidelines are out there such as this that would be like this is you know we we support this as a strategy for designing and it may not be like outright no bike lanes but we suggest this is the preferred this is our next best and this is best so like can we get behind something that's already out there with some good research behind it that you know is our sort of stated um preference for designing new new bike lanes

1264
01:48:38,836 --> 01:48:47,461
[SPEAKER_12]: And I wonder also, Ernie mentioned kind of just in passing the possibility of having dotted lines on the bike lane.

1265
01:48:48,321 --> 01:48:54,825
[SPEAKER_12]: And a possibility could be to make the bike lane dotted and put sharrows in the travel lane in addition.

1266
01:48:55,765 --> 01:48:59,187
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's generally not a thing that's done.

1267
01:48:59,227 --> 01:49:05,330
[SPEAKER_12]: They don't usually do that unless there's a specific reason or a specific request.

1268
01:49:05,470 --> 01:49:06,531
[SPEAKER_12]: But that could be another.

1269
01:49:07,470 --> 01:49:21,975
[SPEAKER_12]: That could be another angle where if the bike lane by itself doesn't have enough width to keep you out of the door zone, then we want these extra additions to make it clear that you don't have to be in the bike lane.

1270
01:49:21,995 --> 01:49:29,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I kind of think there's some creative solutions to have your cake and eat it too like that.

1271
01:49:29,357 --> 01:49:31,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's one great suggestion.

1272
01:49:35,358 --> 01:49:36,872
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't, what do you guys think?

1273
01:49:36,912 --> 01:49:37,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we?

1274
01:49:38,773 --> 01:49:39,714
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think we have to.

1275
01:49:40,834 --> 01:49:48,758
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not asking that we move on this today if we don't have an immediate strong consensus or anything.

1276
01:49:49,979 --> 01:49:55,942
[SPEAKER_12]: But I know that this will keep coming up.

1277
01:49:56,482 --> 01:50:02,205
[SPEAKER_12]: There's bike lanes added in a lot of these kind of minimum situations pretty often.

1278
01:50:03,126 --> 01:50:06,688
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is not the only one, and it won't be the last.

1279
01:50:07,708 --> 01:50:25,084
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I think it does make sense if we have a little bit more to offer here than just, you know, we're so desperate for a bike lane that it's okay if it's not actually

1280
01:50:26,232 --> 01:50:27,513
[SPEAKER_12]: a safe place to ride.

1281
01:50:27,533 --> 01:50:41,363
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're, you know, we're currently we're in the position where we have these door zone bike lanes that are not really a safe place to ride, but people don't feel comfortable moving out of them when they need to.

1282
01:50:42,123 --> 01:50:50,849
[SPEAKER_12]: And you do get harassed when you don't use the bike lane or when you move, you know, when you're just over the edge, because there's because there's somebody parked or whatever.

1283
01:50:50,869 --> 01:50:51,910
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's

1284
01:50:57,037 --> 01:51:04,723
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, we have this situation now, and every time we build another, I know we also have this situation in places that have no bike lanes.

1285
01:51:05,744 --> 01:51:13,210
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think this is something we should be thinking about, even if we don't move on it right this minute, just because it will keep coming up.

1286
01:51:14,131 --> 01:51:14,351
[SPEAKER_12]: Adam?

1287
01:51:14,371 --> 01:51:21,997
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to say, I think people on bikes are going to get harassed, whether there's a bike lane or not, right?

1288
01:51:22,117 --> 01:51:25,760
[SPEAKER_06]: If there's not a lane and you're riding in the middle of the road, you're going to get yelled at also.

1289
01:51:27,102 --> 01:51:42,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so I, I don't know, I, I guess if we are going to sort of support or have a resolution for anything, I would just say it's for more sharrows and more, you know, bikes may use full lane signs.

1290
01:51:46,052 --> 01:51:55,637
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think Todd has said in the past that they don't recommend the bikes may use full lane signs where there's a bike lane, but maybe that's something we need to push back against.

1291
01:51:56,842 --> 01:51:59,263
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe that's, I mean, maybe that's what it is.

1292
01:52:02,264 --> 01:52:14,867
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, every time I go past that one stretch on Boston Ave and I see the Tufts kids riding in that bike lane, I just wonder who's going to be the first one to get doored and throwed in front of a construction vehicle.

1293
01:52:16,531 --> 01:52:16,771
[SPEAKER_12]: Bruce?

1294
01:52:17,131 --> 01:52:25,656
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'd like to reiterate that if we remove the bike lane, that we retain the asymmetrical lane widths so that there's sufficient passing room.

1295
01:52:27,237 --> 01:52:32,140
[SPEAKER_15]: Otherwise, you're going to end up with a 12-foot lane and absolutely no space for anybody.

1296
01:52:36,622 --> 01:52:37,743
[SPEAKER_12]: Ernie, you're muted.

1297
01:52:38,063 --> 01:52:38,743
[SPEAKER_12]: I see you talking.

1298
01:52:44,547 --> 01:52:45,207
[SPEAKER_13]: You're muted, Ernie.

1299
01:52:47,242 --> 01:52:48,303
[SPEAKER_01]: hitting the wrong button there.

1300
01:52:50,963 --> 01:52:54,925
[SPEAKER_01]: Temporary compromises to paint it green, just make it more visible.

1301
01:52:55,905 --> 01:52:58,926
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where you're supposed to be bicyclists, so you don't get yelled at.

1302
01:52:59,046 --> 01:53:06,829
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where your door is going to open, because it is a bike lane construction worker, even if you spill your coffee.

1303
01:53:08,529 --> 01:53:14,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, on that note, Ernie, does anyone find that the green painted lanes are more slick when it's wet?

1304
01:53:15,552 --> 01:53:15,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1305
01:53:17,574 --> 01:53:25,403
[SPEAKER_01]: I, yeah, easily remedied by using textured paint, as is.

1306
01:53:26,124 --> 01:53:32,431
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, I think the texture also starts out pretty good and then it wears off and you're and you end up with paint with the grit.

1307
01:53:33,112 --> 01:53:34,233
[SPEAKER_01]: It has 20 year life.

1308
01:53:36,508 --> 01:53:46,015
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in car auctions, where they use a lot of their safety paint, cars go around them and people have to have traction and icy boots throughout the day.

1309
01:53:46,035 --> 01:53:56,402
[SPEAKER_01]: They're remarkably useful and can be, I won't say lifelong, but certainly multiple years, if not decades.

1310
01:53:56,742 --> 01:54:00,045
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a matter of how much money you want to spend, really is.

1311
01:54:01,347 --> 01:54:03,568
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so it is 9 o'clock.

1312
01:54:04,648 --> 01:54:05,788
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, we had.

1313
01:54:05,928 --> 01:54:08,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I just share my screen real quick?

1314
01:54:08,349 --> 01:54:10,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I just quickly found something that I think is.

1315
01:54:11,710 --> 01:54:16,532
[SPEAKER_04]: So, elucidating the dash line concept here and some different bike markings.

1316
01:54:16,932 --> 01:54:17,432
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is.

1317
01:54:18,442 --> 01:54:21,323
[SPEAKER_04]: this advisory bike lanes in narrow streets.

1318
01:54:21,823 --> 01:54:28,324
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sort of a two-way road where bicyclists can go over, but cars can as well for narrow roads.

1319
01:54:28,384 --> 01:54:31,585
[SPEAKER_04]: But it could actually be a desirable thing to have.

1320
01:54:32,045 --> 01:54:33,005
[SPEAKER_04]: What authority is this?

1321
01:54:33,025 --> 01:54:39,247
[SPEAKER_04]: This is Bike Minnesota, Bike Alliance of Minnesota.

1322
01:54:39,267 --> 01:54:40,627
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1323
01:54:43,828 --> 01:54:44,728
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Tim Cain.

1324
01:54:48,449 --> 01:54:49,250
[SPEAKER_12]: He probably didn't write it.

1325
01:54:49,270 --> 01:54:51,231
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1326
01:54:51,251 --> 01:54:53,233
[SPEAKER_01]: He's good.

1327
01:54:53,253 --> 01:54:55,675
[SPEAKER_04]: They have a three-foot passing law there, apparently.

1328
01:54:55,735 --> 01:54:58,057
[SPEAKER_15]: Could you put a reference in the chat, please?

1329
01:54:59,078 --> 01:54:59,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1330
01:55:00,419 --> 01:55:09,466
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, I think, I guess where I would land on this, personally, is doing some kind of follow-up research to figure out, like, what is the right?

1331
01:55:09,886 --> 01:55:11,327
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's so much out there.

1332
01:55:11,387 --> 01:55:12,688
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of research has been done.

1333
01:55:12,709 --> 01:55:15,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, can we sort of say, like, here is our,

1334
01:55:16,856 --> 01:55:26,105
[SPEAKER_04]: What we subscribe to is the best practices, and we advocate for when we're evaluating designs or trying to push for new lanes.

1335
01:55:28,747 --> 01:55:29,127
[SPEAKER_11]: That's good.

1336
01:55:29,167 --> 01:55:29,508
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1337
01:55:33,371 --> 01:55:36,915
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like the link that Adam sent to.

1338
01:55:36,955 --> 01:55:37,695
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a really nice one.

1339
01:55:38,056 --> 01:55:38,216
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1340
01:55:39,246 --> 01:55:45,728
[SPEAKER_12]: So we can revisit this in the future at the next meeting or at another one.

1341
01:55:45,828 --> 01:55:47,008
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think those are good ideas.

1342
01:55:47,028 --> 01:55:50,189
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that definitely makes a lot of sense.

1343
01:55:53,030 --> 01:55:56,611
[SPEAKER_12]: I think none of this is, nothing gets painted over the winter.

1344
01:55:57,791 --> 01:56:08,394
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not like it's a huge emergency, but I think it's something that is worth spending some time and some thought on because it's going to keep coming up.

1345
01:56:11,951 --> 01:56:14,312
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd like to make a motion.

1346
01:56:14,352 --> 01:56:14,572
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1347
01:56:14,632 --> 01:56:15,972
[SPEAKER_15]: Are we ready to move on to the next piece?

1348
01:56:15,992 --> 01:56:18,313
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I wanted to make a motion.

1349
01:56:18,333 --> 01:56:21,573
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, go ahead.

1350
01:56:23,054 --> 01:56:25,794
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I want to make a motion that we table this until the next meeting.

1351
01:56:26,255 --> 01:56:36,057
[SPEAKER_15]: And I would like to move it as the first item in the agenda, possibly at the expense of other items that we, cause we never seem to get to this and it's an important issue.

1352
01:56:37,498 --> 01:56:37,718
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1353
01:56:37,738 --> 01:56:38,318
[SPEAKER_15]: That's my motion.

1354
01:56:38,338 --> 01:56:40,179
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have a second?

1355
01:56:40,779 --> 01:56:41,339
[SPEAKER_12]: I second it.

1356
01:56:43,159 --> 01:56:43,719
[SPEAKER_12]: All in favor?

1357
01:56:43,739 --> 01:56:46,280
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1358
01:56:46,940 --> 01:56:47,060
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1359
01:56:47,380 --> 01:56:47,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1360
01:56:48,421 --> 01:56:48,981
[SPEAKER_12]: All opposed?

1361
01:56:52,061 --> 01:56:52,302
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

1362
01:56:52,622 --> 01:56:52,942
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1363
01:56:52,982 --> 01:56:58,823
[SPEAKER_12]: This is tabled until next meeting and we'll put it early on the agenda so that we make sure that we give it the attention that it's due.

1364
01:57:00,263 --> 01:57:01,164
[SPEAKER_15]: Motion to adjourn.

1365
01:57:02,084 --> 01:57:02,384
[SPEAKER_15]: All right.

1366
01:57:02,664 --> 01:57:03,144
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks all.

1367
01:57:03,824 --> 01:57:04,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Seconded.

1368
01:57:04,824 --> 01:57:05,385
[SPEAKER_12]: All in favor?

1369
01:57:06,085 --> 01:57:06,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1370
01:57:06,545 --> 01:57:06,645
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1371
01:57:06,825 --> 01:57:06,905
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

1372
01:57:07,887 --> 01:57:11,291
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, good night, Kerr.

1373
01:57:11,311 --> 01:57:12,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Good night.

1374
01:57:12,532 --> 01:57:13,053
[SPEAKER_11]: Bye.

1375
01:57:16,496 --> 01:57:17,377
[SPEAKER_13]: We seconded the deck.
