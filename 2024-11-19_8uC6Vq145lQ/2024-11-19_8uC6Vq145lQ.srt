[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Knight.

26
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,451
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

27
00:01:58,691 --> 00:02:06,777
[SPEAKER_07]: This resolution was filed at the request of a former colleague, Councilor Camuso, who's maintained a very long lasting friendship with Mr. Ercolini.

28
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:18,080
[SPEAKER_07]: And Paul and I were on the phone just the other day and we were catching up and he explained to me that Mr. Riccolini had just retired after 43 long years working at Filene's and Macy's as an electrician.

29
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:23,202
[SPEAKER_07]: I know Mr. Riccolini so I had the pleasure and opportunity to go to high school with his son, David.

00:02:23,222 --> 00:02:24,702
[SPEAKER_07]: We played in the same basketball team together.

31
00:02:25,222 --> 00:02:33,945
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's great to see somebody, Mr. President, who's dedicated so much time to one company and has been able to reach the golden years of retirement after 43 years.

32
00:02:34,145 --> 00:02:36,526
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I'd ask my council colleagues to support me.

33
00:02:36,946 --> 00:02:37,846
[SPEAKER_07]: in off-resolution.

34
00:02:38,306 --> 00:02:38,646

37
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:49,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

38
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:51,530
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco?

39
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:51,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

40
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:52,850
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Knight?

[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

42
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:54,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks?

43
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:54,530
Yes.

44
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,291
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Morell?

45
00:02:55,311 --> 00:02:55,371
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

46
00:02:56,471 --> 00:02:57,131

47
00:02:57,171 --> 00:02:57,431
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

48
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:58,251
[SPEAKER_06]: President Caraviello?

49
00:02:58,451 --> 00:02:58,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

50
00:02:58,711 --> 00:03:00,812
[SPEAKER_06]: Setting the affirmative, motion passes.

51
00:03:03,163 --> 00:03:17,796
[SPEAKER_06]: 21365, authorized by Vice President Knight, be it so resolved that the Medford City Council requests the city administration provide an update relative to the status of contract negotiations with the Building and Recreation Department staff.

52
00:03:17,836 --> 00:03:18,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Knight.

53
00:03:18,957 --> 00:03:20,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

54
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:23,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I do feel as though this resolution is somewhat self-explanatory.

55
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:32,323
[SPEAKER_07]: Ultimately, the Building Department and Recreation Department had to do the contract negotiations with the administration, what appears to be over a year ago now at this point.

56
00:03:32,983 --> 00:03:36,585
[SPEAKER_07]: It's my understanding that the contract negotiations had stalled for some period of time.

57
00:03:36,945 --> 00:03:40,686
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd like to ask for an update as to the status of the ongoing negotiations, Mr. President.

58
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:41,647
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

59
00:03:42,287 --> 00:03:45,568

[SPEAKER_06]: President Caraviello.

74
00:03:59,554 --> 00:04:01,234
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, affirmative motion passes.

75
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:11,998
[SPEAKER_06]: 21366 on by Vice President Knight, being so resolved that the Medford City Council extended steep and sincere condolences to the family of Melissa Menounos on a recent passing.

76
00:04:12,338 --> 00:04:12,998
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Knight.

77
00:04:16,124 --> 00:04:17,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

78
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:27,611
[SPEAKER_07]: off of the Fellsway over in that section of the city, Mr. President, I believe in Councilor Scarpelli's old neck of the woods.

79
00:04:28,112 --> 00:04:36,096
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's the mother of Maria Menounos, of local celebrity from entertainment news and the like, Mr. President, the classmate of mine from high school.

80
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:39,638
[SPEAKER_07]: And she recently lost her mother after a very public battle with brain cancer.

81
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:45,262
[SPEAKER_07]: And we all know what a great job the Menounos have done in being contributors to the city of Medford.

82
00:04:45,282 --> 00:04:49,684
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I'd like to offer deepest condolences to the Menounos family.

83
00:04:50,785 --> 00:04:51,465
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Lee.

84
00:04:51,505 --> 00:04:52,766
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

85
00:04:53,066 --> 00:04:54,486
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you Councilor Knight to bring this forward.

86
00:04:54,506 --> 00:04:58,447
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that the Menounos family, strong family, Medford, I coach Maria.

87
00:05:00,048 --> 00:05:07,010
[SPEAKER_10]: My time as a basketball coach in Medford High and her brother Peter grew up on our street, on Parris Street.

88
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Very hardworking parents and really good people.

89
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:16,853
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know Maria's values of family came from her parents.

90
00:05:16,913 --> 00:05:17,453
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know when she,

91
00:05:18,173 --> 00:05:22,295
[SPEAKER_10]: She hit it big and she brought her mom and dad with her every step of the way.

92
00:05:22,475 --> 00:05:34,541
[SPEAKER_10]: And I know this has been a public battle of this sick disease and cancer and reach out to them and send a deep, deep condolences to the family and sending our prayers.

103
00:05:48,526 --> 00:05:48,866

[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Morell.

105
00:05:49,928 --> 00:05:50,168

[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli.

107
00:05:51,729 --> 00:05:51,970
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:52,771
[SPEAKER_06]: President Garibaldi.

109
00:05:53,031 --> 00:05:53,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

110
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:54,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

111
00:05:55,013 --> 00:05:58,657
[SPEAKER_06]: 2-1, 3-7, offered by Councilor Marks.

112
00:05:58,737 --> 00:06:02,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry, yes.

113
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:04,583
[SPEAKER_06]: Please rise for a moment of silence.

114
00:06:25,543 --> 00:06:38,331
[SPEAKER_06]: 2, 1, 3, 6, 7, offered by Councilor Marksx, be it resolved that the long-term plan to address the condition of the roads are, of the long-term condition to plan to address the condition of our roads be the such.

115
00:06:38,351 --> 00:06:38,912
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marksx.

116
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,142
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

117
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:56,197
[SPEAKER_09]: And I put this on the agenda tonight because of the number of phone calls I've taken and the number of emails I've received, Mr. President, over the last several months.

118
00:06:57,058 --> 00:07:00,042
[SPEAKER_09]: This by no stretch is a new issue.

119
00:07:00,782 --> 00:07:01,563
[SPEAKER_09]: in this community.

120
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:29,178
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wanna thank my colleagues, Vice President Knight, Councilor Scarpelli, Councilor Falco and President Caraviello over the years, I know have put resolutions on regarding the poor condition of our roads and what capital plan will we have to assist us in a systematic approach to repaving our roads.

121
00:07:30,098 --> 00:07:38,540
[SPEAKER_09]: And to date, Mr. President, I think it's clear to state that we have no systematic approach to repaving our roads.

122
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:48,962
[SPEAKER_09]: The mayor recently put together a capital plan which does include paving the roads, but that's the last I heard about it.

123
00:07:49,562 --> 00:07:51,582
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't heard anything else, Mr. President.

124
00:07:52,122 --> 00:07:55,523
[SPEAKER_09]: And over the years, there's been a lot of talk, a lot of lip service,

125
00:07:56,323 --> 00:08:08,309
[SPEAKER_09]: but no formalized plan to address the over 719 streets in this community, which are broken down by 500, I'm sorry, 450 city streets and 269 private ways in our community.

126
00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:10,330
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have over 719 streets.

127
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:15,953
[SPEAKER_09]: And currently right now, Mr. President, what we put into the actual city budget

128
00:08:25,187 --> 00:08:32,509
[SPEAKER_09]: to repave streets, not to fix potholes, to repave streets is a big fat goose egg.

129
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:37,631
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we put in our city budget every year to repave streets.

130
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:44,934
[SPEAKER_09]: We do rely on chapter 90 funding, which on a given year, we get roughly about $980,000.

131
00:08:45,634 --> 00:08:54,417
[SPEAKER_09]: I can tell you firsthand, Mr. President, over the past four and a half years, we repaved

132
00:08:55,007 --> 00:09:00,131
[SPEAKER_09]: nine streets out of 719 in this community.

133
00:09:00,491 --> 00:09:02,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Those were full streets that were paved.

134
00:09:03,714 --> 00:09:06,976
[SPEAKER_09]: And we partially paved another 21 streets.

135
00:09:07,957 --> 00:09:15,143
[SPEAKER_09]: So even at best, if we said there were 30 streets done, Mr. President, in the last five years,

136
00:09:16,963 --> 00:09:32,352
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you look at it, the life expectancy of a road, and depending on the maintenance and how you keep up, depending on the traffic, depending on if you allow heavy trucking on streets, the life expectancy of a street can vary.

137
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:35,954
[SPEAKER_09]: But typically, you're looking at a little over 20 years.

138
00:09:36,975 --> 00:09:42,538
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you look at doing 30 streets every five years,

139
00:09:44,744 --> 00:09:56,976
[SPEAKER_09]: After 20 years, you'll have paved 120 streets, which is 28% of the 450 streets.

140
00:09:57,657 --> 00:09:59,279
[SPEAKER_09]: And that doesn't include private ways.

141
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:06,126
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you take that into consideration, Mr. President, we are never going to get ahead of this.

142
00:10:07,787 --> 00:10:14,743
[SPEAKER_09]: will always be repaving and never have an approach where someday we can be proud and say, look at our roads.

143
00:10:15,184 --> 00:10:17,369
[SPEAKER_09]: They're in beautiful, pristine condition.

144
00:10:19,023 --> 00:10:22,206
[SPEAKER_09]: but we have no such plan, Mr. President, of addressing this.

145
00:10:23,447 --> 00:10:32,635
[SPEAKER_09]: And that doesn't even count the 269 private ways, which is about 40% of all the streets we have in this community.

146
00:10:33,335 --> 00:10:39,721
[SPEAKER_09]: So I offer this tonight, Mr. President, because I think when you look at a community,

147
00:10:40,734 --> 00:10:43,076
[SPEAKER_09]: And you look at the livability.

148
00:10:43,496 --> 00:10:45,698
[SPEAKER_09]: You look at how vibrant a community is.

149
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,919
[SPEAKER_09]: You look at how well it's taken care of.

150
00:10:48,339 --> 00:10:50,361
[SPEAKER_09]: You look at how city government operates.

151
00:10:51,241 --> 00:10:55,084
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it says a lot about a community when you see streets that are torn up.

152
00:10:56,305 --> 00:10:59,447
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a street right next to me, Bradbury.

153
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:02,009
[SPEAKER_09]: They just did a gas line, Mr. President.

154
00:11:02,289 --> 00:11:03,790
[SPEAKER_09]: And we see this all too often.

155
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:09,454
[SPEAKER_09]: They dug maybe a four or five foot trench, two feet wide.

156
00:11:10,315 --> 00:11:12,597
[SPEAKER_09]: And it goes up the entire length of the street.

157
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,320
[SPEAKER_09]: And I asked whether or not they're going to do curb to curb.

158
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,962
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was told, oh, absolutely not.

159
00:11:19,002 --> 00:11:21,684
[SPEAKER_09]: That wasn't part of the recommendations.

160
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:26,708
[SPEAKER_09]: And what they are going to do, Mr. President, is just refill that trench.

161
00:11:28,571 --> 00:11:39,437
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you had a driveway or a new driveway and you allowed someone to come in at no fault of your own and dig up your driveway, you would expect to get your driveway repaved.

162
00:11:40,177 --> 00:11:45,140
[SPEAKER_09]: Not a patch job, which after a few years, if you're lucky, starts to sink.

163
00:11:46,523 --> 00:11:53,870
[SPEAKER_09]: and then there's mix match and it creates craters and potholes and a lot of other concerns, Mr. President.

164
00:11:54,311 --> 00:12:08,485
[SPEAKER_09]: So I ask that we find out from the administration, even though we did get a correspondence regarding this capital plan, if we can get an in-depth report on what's going to be done with the roads

165
00:12:09,976 --> 00:12:21,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, also today there was an announcement that there was $37.4 million that's going to be coming to the city of Medford from the federal government.

166
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:29,130
[SPEAKER_09]: I realize there's still ironing out and hashing out what it can be spent on over how many years and so forth.

167
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:39,658
[SPEAKER_09]: But we have to find out before we do any budgeting if that money can be spent on capital needs, which I believe it can, Mr. President.

168
00:12:40,018 --> 00:12:49,947
[SPEAKER_09]: and I would prefer it be spent on capital needs one-time cost in the community and our roads should be at the top of the list.

169
00:12:50,608 --> 00:13:00,437
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would ask Mr. President that in the form of a motion that we find out more in depth about the mayor's capital plan for the refurbishing of our roads

170
00:13:01,238 --> 00:13:12,121
[SPEAKER_09]: I would ask that the $37.4 million I believe that came out today, if that could be used to fund new roads in the community, infrastructure improvements.

171
00:13:13,122 --> 00:13:25,966
[SPEAKER_09]: And I would ask, Mr. President, that we come up with a systematic approach to addressing our roads that will one day have us see all our roads done over a period of time.

172
00:13:26,506 --> 00:13:30,548
[SPEAKER_09]: and not just 15 to 20, and then 15 to 20.

173
00:13:30,888 --> 00:13:36,891
[SPEAKER_09]: And by the time you get to that second 15 to 20, the first 15 to 20 you go back to, because it's 20 years.

174
00:13:38,392 --> 00:13:40,152
[SPEAKER_09]: So it makes no sense, Mr. President.

175
00:13:40,693 --> 00:13:42,353
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'd put that in the form of a motion.

176
00:13:42,673 --> 00:13:43,014
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

177
00:13:43,074 --> 00:13:43,394
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

178
00:13:43,634 --> 00:13:44,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Knight.

179
00:13:44,935 --> 00:13:46,175
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

180
00:13:46,235 --> 00:13:47,936
[SPEAKER_07]: And thank you, Councilor Marks, for the presentation.

181
00:13:47,996 --> 00:13:48,836
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's spot on.

182
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:52,438
[SPEAKER_07]: I had the opportunity to review the mayor's capital plan.

183
00:13:52,878 --> 00:13:53,879
[SPEAKER_07]: And what I was able to do,

184
00:13:56,275 --> 00:14:06,101
[SPEAKER_07]: derived through my analysis was that this capital plan calls for the resurfacing either partially or totally of about two streets a year for the next six years.

185
00:14:06,902 --> 00:14:13,326
[SPEAKER_07]: And the only investment being made is chapter 90 funds, which is about $900,000 annually, Mr. President.

186
00:14:13,706 --> 00:14:17,948
[SPEAKER_07]: In a community of this size, in the condition of the roads that we have, that investment is not enough.

187
00:14:17,969 --> 00:14:19,650
[SPEAKER_07]: It needs to be reprioritized.

188
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,891
[SPEAKER_07]: This capital plan needs to be reprioritized.

189
00:14:22,371 --> 00:14:22,792
[SPEAKER_07]: For the last,

190
00:14:24,176 --> 00:14:27,697
[SPEAKER_07]: 12 months or so, we've been hearing about a pavement management plan.

191
00:14:28,417 --> 00:14:38,839
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, we had the call-in center come in and put together this capital plan that the mayor is using for FY 21 through 26, touting it as the first ever capital plan that's ever been implemented in the city of Medford.

192
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:43,941
[SPEAKER_07]: Apparently, she doesn't remember, shot the course that the McGlynn administration had put forward.

193
00:14:44,541 --> 00:14:53,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Perhaps she doesn't remember the countless documents that the Burke administration had provided us that looked very similar to this capital plan that came out from the call-in center that the outside contractor provided to us.

194
00:14:54,283 --> 00:14:57,186
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

195
00:14:57,206 --> 00:15:02,510
[SPEAKER_07]: And I do feel as though the investment needs to be more than what it is right now, two streets a year for the next six years.

196
00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:12,078
[SPEAKER_07]: The roadways and the condition they're in right now are not gonna be able to sustain the next six years without a far more significant investment.

197
00:15:12,598 --> 00:15:14,520
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I second the council's motion.

198
00:15:15,683 --> 00:15:16,224
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Falco.

199
00:15:16,664 --> 00:15:16,964
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

200
00:15:17,204 --> 00:15:18,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Excuse me.

201
00:15:18,265 --> 00:15:18,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

202
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:24,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank Councilor Marksley for bringing this forward and Vice President Knight for his comments as well.

203
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:26,672
[SPEAKER_04]: And both Councilors are right.

204
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:33,718
[SPEAKER_04]: There needs to be a specific long-term plan for how we're going to repave roads throughout our community.

205
00:15:34,771 --> 00:15:50,358
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, each one of us, I'm sure year after year, has received countless calls with regards to potholes, just streets being ripped up after the winter from plowing, and you can only patch so long before you need to resurface an entire street.

206
00:15:51,038 --> 00:15:51,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Two streets a year?

207
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,891
[SPEAKER_04]: It's completely, it's just wrong.

208
00:15:56,111 --> 00:15:56,992
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't make any sense.

209
00:15:57,372 --> 00:16:02,214
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll never get to a point where you're going to have new streets throughout most of the community.

210
00:16:02,234 --> 00:16:06,156
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, two streets a year, you're lucky to get a neighborhood done in 10 years.

211
00:16:06,897 --> 00:16:08,678
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to do better in that area.

212
00:16:09,098 --> 00:16:09,939
[SPEAKER_04]: The capital plan,

213
00:16:10,999 --> 00:16:12,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Vice President Knight is correct.

214
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:16,924
[SPEAKER_04]: The capital plan, it does not, there's really, there's not too much to address this.

215
00:16:17,404 --> 00:16:18,485
[SPEAKER_04]: It needs to be addressed.

216
00:16:18,585 --> 00:16:21,167
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, in many ways, these are quality of life issues.

217
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:26,411
[SPEAKER_04]: When people are in their neighborhoods and they're driving and they have potholes all over the place, it's just not right.

218
00:16:26,792 --> 00:16:28,533
[SPEAKER_04]: The administration needs to do a better job.

219
00:16:28,553 --> 00:16:30,735
[SPEAKER_04]: There needs to be a long-term plan.

220
00:16:30,755 --> 00:16:39,802
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I may, Councilor Marks, if you mind, if I would amend the resolution to find out exactly what streets were paved over the past two years.

221
00:16:42,276 --> 00:16:50,079
[SPEAKER_04]: And if we can find out, get an itemized list of how the chapter 90 funding was spent in the past year.

222
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:52,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

223
00:16:53,181 --> 00:17:07,567
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I can say something, for the last two years in a row, myself and Councilor Falco have offered a resolution for a pilot program to bring a company in that comes to the MMA show every year, and they would

224
00:17:09,027 --> 00:17:20,172
[SPEAKER_06]: and we've asked for a pilot to try a half a dozen streets to see how it works, and that went nowhere.

225
00:17:20,192 --> 00:17:26,675
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd ask, if we could offer that, if Councilor Falco would offer that motioning amendment also.

226
00:17:27,935 --> 00:17:30,156
[SPEAKER_06]: for that pilot program to be brought back again.

227
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:33,478
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I think we did offer it earlier in the year, I don't remember.

228
00:17:33,498 --> 00:17:34,678
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, correct.

229
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:51,687
[SPEAKER_04]: President Caraviello, if I may add an amendment to get an update from the DPW as to if the pilot program for resurfacing streets with recycled asphalt will be put in the budget, in the upcoming budget.

230
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:53,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

231
00:17:53,728 --> 00:17:55,489
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I may continue on that,

232
00:17:57,033 --> 00:18:00,774
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was back in February this year.

233
00:18:00,794 --> 00:18:12,298
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they basically do is they take the asphalt right there, and they grind the street down, and it goes into a truck and actually put new asphalt down.

234
00:18:12,498 --> 00:18:13,098
[SPEAKER_04]: You are correct.

235
00:18:13,178 --> 00:18:13,838
[SPEAKER_04]: It's half the cost.

236
00:18:14,659 --> 00:18:17,920
[SPEAKER_04]: And even if they had just a pilot program, just try a few streets.

237
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:19,460
[SPEAKER_04]: It's better than nothing.

238
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:25,322
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's some streets that are in dire need of repair, and this needs to be addressed now more than ever.

239
00:18:25,462 --> 00:18:25,782
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

240
00:18:26,592 --> 00:18:27,353
[SPEAKER_16]: Councilor Morell.

241
00:18:28,113 --> 00:18:28,914
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

242
00:18:28,974 --> 00:18:30,736
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this up.

243
00:18:30,936 --> 00:18:37,322
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we all often hear about residents, you know, about potholes, but many of them do want to know what is the long-term plan.

244
00:18:37,382 --> 00:18:41,646
[SPEAKER_16]: They understand that, you know, a one-time fix lasts only so long.

245
00:18:41,706 --> 00:18:45,729
[SPEAKER_16]: So I thank Councilor Marks for bringing this up and the other Councilors for their comments.

246
00:18:45,789 --> 00:18:50,614
[SPEAKER_16]: And I also thank him for adding the part about the, you know, the American Rescue Plan money.

247
00:18:50,634 --> 00:18:51,915
[SPEAKER_16]: We now have a dollar amount

248
00:18:52,407 --> 00:18:57,528
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is something I've asked for multiple motions, trying to get an understanding of how the administration intends to use this money.

249
00:18:58,008 --> 00:19:03,910
[SPEAKER_16]: I understand that we're still trying to find out or learning of how it can be used, but budget time is coming.

250
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:08,151
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is a huge amount of money that will really impact decisions from this council.

251
00:19:08,191 --> 00:19:10,291
[SPEAKER_16]: And I, you know, this is something we really need to have.

252
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:11,752
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you for bringing that up.

253
00:19:12,892 --> 00:19:13,292
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

254
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:21,614
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by council Marks as amended by council Marks and as amended

255
00:19:22,772 --> 00:19:23,292
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

256
00:19:25,113 --> 00:19:26,013
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

257
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:43,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Just while we're on the subject, because it's somewhat related, I'm not going to offer it tonight, but in addition to the streets, Mr. President, all you have to do is take a walk around the neighborhood and see the hundreds of old tree stumps that are lined on our streets, up and down.

258
00:19:44,578 --> 00:19:47,199
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd venture to say there's thousands in this city.

259
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,940
[SPEAKER_09]: I've done a count just in my neighborhood alone.

260
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,402
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's literally 30 or 40 just on abutting streets.

261
00:19:55,163 --> 00:19:57,324
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can tell they've been cut down for years.

262
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:59,064
[SPEAKER_09]: This is not new stumps.

263
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:01,426
[SPEAKER_09]: These have been stumps that have been around for years.

264
00:20:01,686 --> 00:20:04,907
[SPEAKER_09]: And this council has asked, Mr. President, about the stump list.

265
00:20:05,307 --> 00:20:07,689
[SPEAKER_09]: And in the past, we've got, well, here's a list.

266
00:20:07,709 --> 00:20:10,130
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we get a partial list, not a full list.

267
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:15,512
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we got an indication a couple of years back that they went through 90% of the stumps.

268
00:20:17,013 --> 00:20:17,373
[SPEAKER_09]: Where?

269
00:20:18,073 --> 00:20:18,293
[SPEAKER_09]: Where?

270
00:20:18,593 --> 00:20:20,834
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all around the community, Mr. President.

271
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:26,255
[SPEAKER_09]: So tree stumps, raised sidewalks, trip and fall hazards everywhere.

272
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:35,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone just sent me a photo of a woman that fell over the weekend in the square, busted her nose open wide, Mr. President, on a sidewalk that was slanted up.

273
00:20:36,196 --> 00:20:38,977
[SPEAKER_09]: But this exists everywhere, Mr. President, throughout this community.

274
00:20:39,417 --> 00:20:40,377
[SPEAKER_09]: Rose is part of it.

275
00:20:41,017 --> 00:20:44,318
[SPEAKER_09]: Broken sidewalks, tree stumps, double poles,

276
00:20:44,918 --> 00:20:48,779
[SPEAKER_09]: It speaks volumes about a community and a community that cares.

277
00:20:49,379 --> 00:20:55,301
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, you take a look around this community and, you know, I hate to say it, but it looks like no one cares, really.

278
00:20:56,361 --> 00:20:57,421
[SPEAKER_09]: And we got to do a better job.

279
00:20:57,441 --> 00:20:58,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

280
00:20:58,142 --> 00:20:58,462
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

281
00:21:00,002 --> 00:21:00,502
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Falco.

282
00:21:01,663 --> 00:21:02,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Councilor.

283
00:21:02,363 --> 00:21:04,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, President Caballero.

284
00:21:04,043 --> 00:21:06,964
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to thank Councilor Marks for bringing that forward as well.

285
00:21:07,544 --> 00:21:10,365
[SPEAKER_04]: I know during this pandemic, I've been trying to do a lot of walking.

286
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:13,173
[SPEAKER_04]: through various neighborhoods throughout our city.

287
00:21:13,854 --> 00:21:15,234
[SPEAKER_04]: And Councilor Marks is right.

288
00:21:15,474 --> 00:21:22,798
[SPEAKER_04]: If you take a walk through the neighborhoods, no matter what neighborhood you go to, there are stumps everywhere and there are raised sidewalks everywhere.

289
00:21:23,119 --> 00:21:24,619
[SPEAKER_04]: Trip hazards beyond belief.

290
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,501
[SPEAKER_04]: And they need to be addressed.

291
00:21:27,781 --> 00:21:28,842
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't been addressed.

292
00:21:29,968 --> 00:21:34,431
[SPEAKER_04]: We have not been given any type of a program that's going to address these issues.

293
00:21:35,911 --> 00:21:37,012
[SPEAKER_04]: The residents deserve better.

294
00:21:37,452 --> 00:21:40,014
[SPEAKER_04]: These are trip hazards literally right in front of their house.

295
00:21:40,774 --> 00:21:41,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone's going to get hurt.

296
00:21:41,595 --> 00:21:43,436
[SPEAKER_04]: And unfortunately it sounds like someone already did.

297
00:21:44,396 --> 00:21:44,776
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

298
00:21:46,858 --> 00:21:47,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President.

299
00:21:49,619 --> 00:21:58,324
[SPEAKER_07]: In building upon what councilor Marks and councilor Falco said, this isn't just a quality of life issue.

300
00:21:58,964 --> 00:22:01,004
[SPEAKER_07]: This is more than a quality of life issue, Mr. President.

301
00:22:01,024 --> 00:22:01,885
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a safety issue.

302
00:22:02,805 --> 00:22:06,026
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a service delivery issue, but most importantly, it's a pride issue.

303
00:22:06,906 --> 00:22:11,707
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, do we want to be known as the community when someone's driving into Medford from Winchester, they say, all right, get ready.

304
00:22:11,727 --> 00:22:14,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we come entering Medford.

305
00:22:14,527 --> 00:22:17,468
[SPEAKER_07]: When they're coming in from Arlington entering Medford, driving down these terrible streets.

306
00:22:17,528 --> 00:22:21,069
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's not the image, Mr. President, that I think we want to portray to our neighboring communities.

307
00:22:21,909 --> 00:22:26,570
[SPEAKER_07]: We have people in this town that are spending outrageous, outrageous amounts of money to purchase homes.

308
00:22:28,407 --> 00:22:41,076
[SPEAKER_07]: And how long do we think that the residents are going to be able to put up with the lack of service delivery in direct correlation to their tax bills and what they're paying, Mr. President?

309
00:22:41,096 --> 00:22:42,817
[SPEAKER_07]: Because right now it's significantly lacking.

310
00:22:42,877 --> 00:22:45,839
[SPEAKER_07]: The services that we offer are significantly lacking and we need to do better.

311
00:22:48,262 --> 00:22:52,764
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm seeing stumps in this community, and as Councilor Markswell, they've been there so long, they're getting taller.

312
00:22:53,685 --> 00:22:55,686
[SPEAKER_07]: I see stumps in the city that are five feet high now.

313
00:22:55,926 --> 00:23:01,128
[SPEAKER_07]: If you look at the intersection of Winter Street and Lawrence Road, for example, there was a dead tree in front of the house there.

314
00:23:02,129 --> 00:23:03,850
[SPEAKER_07]: The resident asked for the tree to be taken down.

315
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:05,331
[SPEAKER_07]: The tree never got taken down, Mr. President.

316
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:07,492
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead, the tree fell down on the resident's house.

317
00:23:08,391 --> 00:23:10,273
[SPEAKER_07]: The resident gets the tree removed from his front yard.

318
00:23:10,433 --> 00:23:11,755
[SPEAKER_07]: He calls the city to remove the stump.

319
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:12,936
[SPEAKER_07]: The city cuts the stump.

320
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:16,461
[SPEAKER_07]: The stump's five and a half feet high, and it's starting to grow leaves out of it now it's been there so long.

321
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:18,363
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, enough's enough, Mr. President.

322
00:23:18,403 --> 00:23:20,285
[SPEAKER_07]: It's time that we stop putting the boots back on the ground.

323
00:23:20,305 --> 00:23:21,907
[SPEAKER_07]: We reopen City Hall, and we get back to work.

324
00:23:22,488 --> 00:23:22,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

325
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,089
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

326
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:32,335
[SPEAKER_12]: Louise D'Antonio, 41 Dartmouth Street, Medford Mass.

327
00:23:32,936 --> 00:23:39,768
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a suggestion, and it may be off the wall, but why don't we have our good neighbor, Tufts University.

328
00:23:40,774 --> 00:23:44,095
[SPEAKER_12]: for a donation towards funding for streets.

329
00:23:44,195 --> 00:23:47,716
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, there are people that live along the backside of St.

330
00:23:47,736 --> 00:23:51,057
[SPEAKER_12]: Brookings Street, and people are inconvenienced.

331
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,037
[SPEAKER_12]: They work on the roads a lot.

332
00:23:53,297 --> 00:23:54,478
[SPEAKER_12]: They inconvenience people.

333
00:23:54,818 --> 00:24:07,421
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it would be a nice gesture if the city asked us to contribute to the improvement of the roads and the streets, if not in the entire city, at least perhaps in the area where they're located.

334
00:24:08,201 --> 00:24:10,482
[SPEAKER_12]: But I just thought it might be a way of bringing in some extra money.

335
00:24:11,062 --> 00:24:11,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

336
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:14,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

337
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:16,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address of the record, please.

338
00:24:16,063 --> 00:24:16,643
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

339
00:24:16,703 --> 00:24:19,744
[SPEAKER_14]: Anita D'Antonio, 14 Yale Street, Medford.

340
00:24:20,364 --> 00:24:23,744
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to say the sound system, I haven't been here for a long time.

341
00:24:23,844 --> 00:24:24,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for coming.

342
00:24:24,904 --> 00:24:26,285
[SPEAKER_14]: It's much improved.

343
00:24:26,385 --> 00:24:30,585
[SPEAKER_14]: You can actually hear everything that's being said, so that's great.

344
00:24:30,965 --> 00:24:35,126
[SPEAKER_14]: I just wanted to give you some perspective.

345
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:39,047
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a great guy who used to do a lot of videotaping in the city.

346
00:24:40,032 --> 00:24:41,433
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know his first name.

347
00:24:42,073 --> 00:24:43,434
[SPEAKER_14]: He was Mr. Fiorello.

348
00:24:44,235 --> 00:24:46,916
[SPEAKER_14]: He was a longtime resident of Medford.

349
00:24:48,017 --> 00:24:56,842
[SPEAKER_14]: He at one time in the 1990s, I believe it was, came up to the podium more than once talking about the roads in Medford.

350
00:24:57,723 --> 00:25:06,308
[SPEAKER_14]: And he said, if you took a glass of milk with you and you drove down High Street, by the time you got to the end of it, you'd have a milkshake.

351
00:25:07,049 --> 00:25:08,730
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, now we have a milkshake.

352
00:25:09,624 --> 00:25:13,127
[SPEAKER_14]: Winthrop, Main Street, High Street.

353
00:25:13,848 --> 00:25:26,779
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would hope by the year 2021 now, maybe in his memory, we'll drive down the street with a glass of milk and end up with a glass of milk when we traverse it.

354
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,042
[SPEAKER_14]: But it's just so long ago.

355
00:25:29,622 --> 00:25:32,665
[SPEAKER_14]: And this has been a problem chronically.

356
00:25:33,478 --> 00:25:40,291
[SPEAKER_14]: since, gee, probably before the 1990s, but it certainly, there's not been much improvement.

357
00:25:40,592 --> 00:25:42,275
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's what I want to say.

358
00:25:42,295 --> 00:25:43,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

359
00:25:44,988 --> 00:25:54,071
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, on the motion by Councilor Marks, as amended by Councilor Marks and amended by Councilor Falco once and amended by Councilor Falco a second time.

360
00:25:54,311 --> 00:25:56,092
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, just if we could.

361
00:25:57,692 --> 00:25:58,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

362
00:25:58,753 --> 00:26:05,835
[SPEAKER_09]: While we're on the tree stump subject, I'd like to put a motion forward that the city administration

363
00:26:07,685 --> 00:26:16,410
[SPEAKER_09]: do a thorough walkthrough of the city and give us an exact count of the number of tree stumps, Mr. President.

364
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:20,793
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I don't think they have an understanding on how many are out there.

365
00:26:21,734 --> 00:26:26,681
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we can address it this year's budget because it's actually gonna be a budget of mine.

366
00:26:26,741 --> 00:26:28,744
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Knights, absolutely right.

367
00:26:29,165 --> 00:26:35,634
[SPEAKER_09]: You had people in this community that paid a very high tax, Mr. President, and not receiving the city service.

368
00:26:35,654 --> 00:26:37,036
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you wanna make that a big paper?

369
00:26:37,176 --> 00:26:38,438
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I'd like to make it a big paper.

370
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:53,463
[SPEAKER_09]: And when you can use these particular stumps and double poles as a reference, when you tell someone to take a left at the double pole and then take a right at the tree stump that's been there a hundred years, you know, they've been around a long time.

371
00:26:53,943 --> 00:26:59,145
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think Mr. President, we have to get a handle on the number and address it in this year's budget.

372
00:26:59,586 --> 00:27:00,166
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

373
00:27:00,646 --> 00:27:00,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

374
00:27:00,906 --> 00:27:02,987
[SPEAKER_06]: On the original paper offered by Councilor Mack,

375
00:27:05,215 --> 00:27:08,277
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we've already started the procedure on this one.

376
00:27:08,438 --> 00:27:14,642
[SPEAKER_06]: On the paper, the original motion offered by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

377
00:27:14,662 --> 00:27:15,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

378
00:27:16,443 --> 00:27:16,904
[SPEAKER_06]: As amended.

379
00:27:18,365 --> 00:27:18,945

380
00:27:19,686 --> 00:27:19,946

[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

392
00:27:28,072 --> 00:27:28,212
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

393
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:28,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

00:27:28,452 --> 00:27:28,652
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

00:27:49,205 --> 00:27:49,865

396
00:27:50,026 --> 00:27:50,226
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

397
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:50,966
[SPEAKER_11]: President Caraviello.

398
00:27:51,146 --> 00:27:52,687
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I'm in the frame of the motion passes.

399

[SPEAKER_09]: Officer McGillivray would spend the next several years in and out of the hospital undergoing additional procedures as a result of his injuries sustained during the traffic stop.

[SPEAKER_09]: Patrolman McGillivray eventually made it back to his beloved job at DDC police and was forced to retire on December 31st, 1984 due to injuries sustained in the line of duty.

418
00:30:54,276 --> 00:31:06,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone that knew Harold knew he was a man of integrity, a man of faith, a man who loved his family, and a man who took his job very seriously.

419
00:31:09,605 --> 00:31:12,687
[SPEAKER_09]: If you were in need, Harold McGillivray Jr.

420
00:31:13,167 --> 00:31:17,750
[SPEAKER_09]: would be the first at your doorstep, Mr. President.

421
00:31:18,091 --> 00:31:20,412

424
00:31:36,803 --> 00:31:37,944
[SPEAKER_09]: He was the bulldog.

425
00:31:39,521 --> 00:31:43,763
[SPEAKER_09]: Anyone that knew him, he was tough as nails, but he had a heart of gold, Mr. President.

426
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:46,325
[SPEAKER_09]: He'd be the first to step forward and help.

427
00:31:47,105 --> 00:32:03,334
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is a huge honor to have his name placed on the monument in Washington, D.C., with 22,611 other heroes that protect every day the citizens of Method, put their life on the line.

428
00:32:04,192 --> 00:32:05,092
[SPEAKER_09]: to do their job.

429
00:32:05,853 --> 00:32:30,963
[SPEAKER_09]: And as I stated last week, for one of our state police officers that retired after three decades, Mr. President, I say the same about Harold McGilvery Jr., a man that was dedicated, a man that cared about his community more than anything else, and someone that should be recognized.

430
00:32:31,363 --> 00:32:33,384
[SPEAKER_09]: And I ask that this meeting, Mr. President,

431
00:32:34,213 --> 00:32:36,994
[SPEAKER_09]: be named in honor of Harold McGillivray Jr.

432
00:32:38,034 --> 00:32:41,915
[SPEAKER_09]: for his commitment to this community and the residents of the Commonwealth.

433
00:32:42,615 --> 00:32:54,998
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to show our appreciation for having his name placed on the National Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington, DC, which is going to happen on the 13th, which is this Thursday.

434
00:32:55,318 --> 00:32:56,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

435
00:32:56,298 --> 00:32:56,578
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

436
00:32:58,901 --> 00:33:12,328
[SPEAKER_06]: And Council Box said we'd be remiss if we didn't mention that his two sons, both Harold and Paul, are both fine officers in our Methodist Police Department who followed in the footsteps of their dad.

437
00:33:12,348 --> 00:33:12,948
[SPEAKER_06]: That is correct.

438
00:33:12,968 --> 00:33:13,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. President.

439
00:33:15,229 --> 00:33:15,469
[SPEAKER_17]: Good evening.

440
00:33:15,489 --> 00:33:16,530
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address of the record, please.

441
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:17,870
[SPEAKER_17]: Excuse me.

442
00:33:18,010 --> 00:33:20,371
[SPEAKER_17]: My name is Anthony D'Antonio, 24 Hicks Avenue.

443
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:27,555
[SPEAKER_17]: It's such an honor to see an honor bestowed on this gentleman, Harold McGilvra Jr.

444
00:33:28,331 --> 00:33:36,956
[SPEAKER_17]: I met Harold when I was eight years old, and he was a teenager, and he was going out with his future wife over on Marion Street, Main Street.

445
00:33:36,976 --> 00:33:40,137
[SPEAKER_17]: The four houses that connected in the back all together, we all used to play there.

446
00:33:40,838 --> 00:33:41,918
[SPEAKER_17]: We used to torture Harry.

447
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:43,219
[SPEAKER_17]: He was older.

448
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:48,702
[SPEAKER_17]: Back then when kids tortured the older kids, they'd smack you around a little bit.

449
00:33:48,742 --> 00:33:49,402
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a lot of fun.

450
00:33:50,163 --> 00:33:51,664
[SPEAKER_17]: I gotta tell you something about Harry.

451
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,865
[SPEAKER_17]: One of the toughest guys I ever met.

452
00:33:55,666 --> 00:33:57,527
[SPEAKER_17]: He wasn't supposed to survive that accident.

453
00:33:58,666 --> 00:34:06,028
[SPEAKER_17]: When Harry walked down the street, if he was coming from Tufts Park after banging in a box, okay, you could tell it was Harry.

454
00:34:06,048 --> 00:34:06,509
[SPEAKER_17]: You know why?

455
00:34:06,969 --> 00:34:09,750
[SPEAKER_17]: The street lamps used to shine off the spit on his shoes.

456
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,650
[SPEAKER_17]: They used to, it was incredible.

457
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,431
[SPEAKER_17]: He was like a parade dress all the time.

458
00:34:14,291 --> 00:34:18,953
[SPEAKER_17]: When Harry was in the neighborhood and he was on patrol that night, you don't have to worry about anything.

459
00:34:18,993 --> 00:34:20,253
[SPEAKER_17]: You can leave your doors unlocked.

460
00:34:20,693 --> 00:34:23,174
[SPEAKER_17]: He didn't need a patrol car to get to the scene.

461
00:34:23,274 --> 00:34:24,495
[SPEAKER_17]: He'd run to the scene.

462
00:34:24,515 --> 00:34:25,295
[SPEAKER_17]: He was incredible.

463
00:34:25,455 --> 00:34:27,035
[SPEAKER_17]: He was just one of those people.

464
00:34:27,636 --> 00:34:28,436
[SPEAKER_17]: And when you got into,

465
00:34:29,435 --> 00:34:42,241
[SPEAKER_17]: many conversations and he had some conversations up here and a couple of times they got heated, but then when he was proven that his point was not the correct point, Harry would come up and he'd apologize and say, I'm sorry, this is the information I had.

466
00:34:43,121 --> 00:34:47,223
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just, I can remember the day that he got hit.

467
00:34:47,303 --> 00:34:57,728
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember the day when he first came down the streets and he pretty much put up all of us on notice, but the McGilvery family is a long, long,

468
00:34:58,443 --> 00:35:01,564
[SPEAKER_17]: history in the city of Medford and in South Medford.

469
00:35:02,045 --> 00:35:06,307
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you didn't know him at Gilbrey, you didn't come from Medford.

470
00:35:06,787 --> 00:35:08,007
[SPEAKER_17]: So God bless him.

471
00:35:08,467 --> 00:35:08,768
[SPEAKER_17]: Bye bye.

472
00:35:09,188 --> 00:35:09,488
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

473
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:14,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

474
00:35:14,637 --> 00:35:18,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, Medford, Mass, former member of the Saugus party.

475
00:35:19,404 --> 00:35:27,116
[SPEAKER_05]: My recollection of Harrell goes back to the many times, not only him being a police officer, but the many times he stayed involved in his community.

476
00:35:27,136 --> 00:35:28,578
[SPEAKER_05]: He used to come to these council meetings.

477
00:35:29,098 --> 00:35:30,099
[SPEAKER_05]: on numerous occasions.

478
00:35:30,139 --> 00:35:32,440
[SPEAKER_05]: And if he had an opinion to make, he would make it.

479
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,861
[SPEAKER_05]: And he would tell you right to your face what he thought of you.

480
00:35:34,881 --> 00:35:37,582
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the same way he acted when he was a police officer.

481
00:35:37,983 --> 00:35:41,124
[SPEAKER_05]: If he made an infraction of the law, you were guilty of doing it.

482
00:35:41,344 --> 00:35:43,785
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if he wanted to give you a break, that would be a separate story.

483
00:35:44,326 --> 00:35:52,510
[SPEAKER_05]: But the interesting part about Harold is I think he represents what a lot of people try to do to a police officer today.

484
00:35:53,804 --> 00:35:56,405
[SPEAKER_05]: They try to make them look like a bad person.

485
00:35:56,706 --> 00:35:58,286
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not out there for the community.

486
00:35:59,007 --> 00:36:02,829
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the worst message you can send out there right now.

487
00:36:02,849 --> 00:36:06,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Harold McGillivray was a policeman's policeman.

488
00:36:06,611 --> 00:36:20,099
[SPEAKER_05]: And he represents every single policeman that puts that uniform on every day, puts that gun, puts that badge, and goes out there to defend the people of the community that they're in, whether it's city, county, state, or whatever it might be.

489
00:36:21,099 --> 00:36:37,735
[SPEAKER_05]: I would hope that the people of Medford not only appreciate the fact that Harold McGillivray and the family and his two sons, who are also police officers in the city, are going to have their father's name be put on the plaque that represents what law enforcement is in this country.

490
00:36:38,276 --> 00:36:42,440
[SPEAKER_05]: They're there to help and defend the people, and that's what it should be about.

491
00:36:43,544 --> 00:36:45,786
[SPEAKER_05]: not to debunk them, but to defend them.

492
00:36:46,407 --> 00:36:52,513
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a shame that anyone tries to do anything to take away from the integrity of what a police officer is.

493
00:36:52,933 --> 00:36:58,598
[SPEAKER_05]: And to Mr. Harold McGillivray, I thank him very much because I enjoyed him and he was a good supporter of mine.

494
00:36:58,819 --> 00:37:00,620
[SPEAKER_05]: And because of that, I support him as well.

495
00:37:01,041 --> 00:37:01,381
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

496
00:37:02,622 --> 00:37:12,065
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I want to thank, I've known the McGilvery family both as a friend and as a friend of the family, and believe it or not, I was just paper boy, as he objected.

497
00:37:13,226 --> 00:37:20,188
[SPEAKER_06]: And Harold and his brothers were both good family, good community members, always volunteering.

498
00:37:20,608 --> 00:37:23,689
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, this is, thank you, Councilor Marks, for putting this on.

499
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:25,350
[SPEAKER_06]: And Mr. President.

500
00:37:26,518 --> 00:37:27,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Mayne.

501
00:37:28,044 --> 00:37:32,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we'd be remiss in not pointing out the role that Mr. McGilvray had.

502
00:37:32,888 --> 00:37:37,711
[SPEAKER_07]: in professionalizing policing across America through his involvement in organized labor.

503
00:37:38,692 --> 00:37:53,022
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. McGilvrey was a champion on behalf of his colleagues, police officers across America, across Massachusetts, in fighting for collective bargaining rights and lobbying up at the State House for benefits for police officers in the line of duty, which he was one, Mr. President.

504
00:37:53,122 --> 00:37:57,065
[SPEAKER_07]: And if we think about the nature of the injuries that Mr. McGilvrey

505
00:37:57,865 --> 00:38:03,929
[SPEAKER_07]: sustained and how long he suffered, many would say that he'd still be with us today if it weren't for that fateful night and that accident that occurred.

506
00:38:04,510 --> 00:38:21,761
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, this is a very prestigious honor, and I want to join Councilman Marks in extending my congratulations to the family for their hard work and perseverance in making sure that Mr. McGilvery's name is in fact included in the law enforcement memorial down in Washington, D.C.

507
00:38:22,221 --> 00:38:24,263
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, thank you very much, Councilman Marks.

508
00:38:25,631 --> 00:38:30,757
[SPEAKER_06]: on the motion by Council Mark seconded by second by Councilor Falco.

509
00:38:30,777 --> 00:38:31,899
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

510
00:38:36,243 --> 00:38:36,804
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Bears.

511
00:38:37,345 --> 00:38:37,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

512
00:38:38,786 --> 00:38:39,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

513
00:38:39,507 --> 00:38:39,727
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

514
00:38:40,228 --> 00:38:40,909
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Knight.

515
00:38:40,929 --> 00:38:40,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

516
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:42,230
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

517
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:42,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

518
00:38:43,191 --> 00:38:43,792
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Morell.

519
00:38:44,172 --> 00:38:44,353
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

520
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:46,023
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli?

521
00:38:46,183 --> 00:38:46,423
Yes.

522
00:38:46,623 --> 00:38:47,384
[SPEAKER_06]: President Caraviello?

523
00:38:47,424 --> 00:38:48,965
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, second the affirmative motion passes.

524
00:38:49,325 --> 00:38:53,588
[SPEAKER_06]: Before we do communications from the mayor, I thought Marianne was on the call.

525
00:38:54,529 --> 00:38:58,672
[SPEAKER_06]: She was gonna give us just a brief synopsis on the COVID update.

526
00:38:58,692 --> 00:38:59,613
[SPEAKER_06]: Marianne, are you still there?

527
00:38:59,633 --> 00:39:03,255
[SPEAKER_06]: There you are.

528
00:39:03,535 --> 00:39:05,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Marianne.

529
00:39:05,437 --> 00:39:09,320
[SPEAKER_06]: Marianne, can you give us a brief update of what's happening in the community with the COVID?

530
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:10,448
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure.

531
00:39:10,508 --> 00:39:11,408
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, everyone.

532
00:39:11,448 --> 00:39:14,469
[SPEAKER_15]: Good evening, Mr. President of the City Council.

533
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:17,550
[SPEAKER_15]: So great news or good news anyways.

534
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:24,313
[SPEAKER_15]: Last two weeks we've had case counts in the single digits, which is wonderful.

535
00:39:24,493 --> 00:39:27,534
[SPEAKER_15]: We haven't had that probably since October.

536
00:39:28,214 --> 00:39:30,315
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're very excited about that.

537
00:39:31,155 --> 00:39:34,736
[SPEAKER_15]: Since May 1, we've had 38 cases reported.

538
00:39:38,662 --> 00:39:42,223
[SPEAKER_15]: 20 of those cases are ages 29 and less.

539
00:39:42,883 --> 00:39:45,224
[SPEAKER_15]: So we really wanna focus on that population.

540
00:39:45,264 --> 00:39:47,724
[SPEAKER_15]: We really wanna make sure that they get vaccinated.

541
00:39:48,745 --> 00:39:56,306
[SPEAKER_15]: You've heard that the FDA has approved going forward now the Pfizer vaccine for 12 plus.

542
00:39:57,487 --> 00:40:02,088
[SPEAKER_15]: So we are very hopeful that we'll be able to do a vaccination clinic next week.

543
00:40:03,656 --> 00:40:15,538
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm at the interest middle school for 1612 plus, which will be, which will be great, because those are the kids and now we're entering the sports season.

544
00:40:16,439 --> 00:40:19,959
[SPEAKER_15]: This week they did loosen a lot of the guidelines around sports.

545
00:40:20,739 --> 00:40:28,501
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's a little concerning but if you know if we can get vaccines out there and people still adhere.

546
00:40:29,197 --> 00:40:34,201
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, they loosened up the guidelines around sports as far as face coverings are concerned.

547
00:40:34,801 --> 00:40:40,025
[SPEAKER_15]: But again, it's only if you can maintain that six feet social distancing.

548
00:40:40,606 --> 00:40:43,088
[SPEAKER_15]: So they're saying, you know, baseball, softball.

549
00:40:43,128 --> 00:40:45,730
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's a little leak that everyone's really excited about.

550
00:40:45,770 --> 00:40:53,256
[SPEAKER_15]: But again, if you can't maintain six feet social distancing, you really still should be wearing a mask.

551
00:40:55,471 --> 00:41:00,253
[SPEAKER_15]: Last week we did offer a clinic at the high school for the 16 plus for the Pfizer.

552
00:41:00,273 --> 00:41:04,515
[SPEAKER_15]: We didn't get a lot of takers, which was a little bit disappointing.

553
00:41:05,335 --> 00:41:15,299
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm hoping that maybe that means a lot of our 16 plus have already been vaccinated, but they will certainly be welcome next week at the Andrews.

554
00:41:15,399 --> 00:41:21,582
[SPEAKER_15]: On Tuesday is what we're planning as long as the CDC signs off on the FDA approval.

555
00:41:22,316 --> 00:41:27,018
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm hoping that Tuesday at the end of this, we will be doing this clinic for 12 plus.

556
00:41:28,799 --> 00:41:35,021
[SPEAKER_15]: We're also planning on a clinic on 522 at the West Bedford Community Center.

557
00:41:35,061 --> 00:41:38,362
[SPEAKER_15]: The Bangladesh community had reached out to us, which was amazing.

558
00:41:39,123 --> 00:41:46,345
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're hoping to offer a clinic at the West Bedford Community Center on 522, as well another clinic on 528.

559
00:41:51,219 --> 00:41:59,804
[SPEAKER_15]: focusing on the Haitian Creole community, with thanks to Pastor Pierre, who is helping us organize that.

560
00:42:01,224 --> 00:42:16,132
[SPEAKER_15]: We were planning on having what I guess people would call a town hall, but what we're going to be calling a real talk series about the vaccine and the effectiveness and the concerns people might have.

561
00:42:16,937 --> 00:42:22,380
[SPEAKER_15]: We were going to host that on the 19th, we're going to move that to the 26th.

562
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:31,804
[SPEAKER_15]: Cambridge Health Alliance and City of Cambridge is actually hosting the Haitian Creole specific town hall on the 19th.

563
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:33,605
[SPEAKER_15]: So we didn't want to interfere with that.

564
00:42:34,065 --> 00:42:35,586
[SPEAKER_15]: And there should be a lot of good information.

565
00:42:36,126 --> 00:42:44,570
[SPEAKER_15]: But as well, the 26th will be a kickoff to a series of real talk conversations we'll be having and targeting specific communities.

566
00:42:45,347 --> 00:42:50,249
[SPEAKER_15]: around the concerns, hesitancy, if any, around getting the vaccine.

567
00:42:52,790 --> 00:43:01,853
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll be finishing off our 250 homebound vaccines this week, which is really excited about.

568
00:43:02,014 --> 00:43:09,817
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, like there has been a lot of changes as of 5-10 and more to come as of 5-29.

569
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:10,537
[SPEAKER_15]: So sector specific,

570
00:43:14,157 --> 00:43:33,502
[SPEAKER_15]: specific changes for restaurants and retail and so any of those businesses, if they have concerns, they can call us certainly but a lot of those updates are already on the mass.gov website, but like around sports tournaments now allowed.

571
00:43:34,082 --> 00:43:35,802
[SPEAKER_15]: A lot of things that I've said no to.

572
00:43:36,562 --> 00:43:38,123
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, so forget everything I said.

573
00:43:39,608 --> 00:43:41,049
[SPEAKER_15]: The tournaments are now allowed.

574
00:43:41,149 --> 00:43:48,354
[SPEAKER_15]: The face covering again is a little bit more relaxed, but again, you must be six feet able to six feet social distance.

575
00:43:48,854 --> 00:43:50,655
[SPEAKER_15]: Road races are now allowed.

576
00:43:51,276 --> 00:44:00,582
[SPEAKER_15]: Spectators are now allowed for the 20 plus adult sports, which had been not allowed at all previously.

577
00:44:00,682 --> 00:44:05,385
[SPEAKER_15]: So a lot of changes this week and a lot more to come on May 29th.

578
00:44:07,184 --> 00:44:10,486
[SPEAKER_15]: And again, people have any questions, they can certainly reach out to us.

579
00:44:11,247 --> 00:44:17,030
[SPEAKER_15]: But a lot of those guidance documents have been updated already on the mass.gov website.

580
00:44:17,050 --> 00:44:22,653
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that's what I have.

581
00:44:23,313 --> 00:44:25,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

582
00:44:26,295 --> 00:44:27,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

583
00:44:27,396 --> 00:44:31,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much to you and to your staff for all your hard work.

584
00:44:32,075 --> 00:44:36,696
[SPEAKER_04]: With regard to the 12 plus vaccine, I believe you said next Tuesday?

585
00:44:37,477 --> 00:44:38,437
[SPEAKER_15]: We're hoping.

586
00:44:38,617 --> 00:44:39,357
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to wait.

587
00:44:39,737 --> 00:44:44,018
[SPEAKER_15]: The FDA has approved, but the CDC has not signed off yet.

588
00:44:44,839 --> 00:44:48,760
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's expected to come by Friday with more guidance to follow.

589
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:53,301
[SPEAKER_15]: So yes, Tuesday would be the date if we're all good to go.

590
00:44:53,401 --> 00:44:55,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Would that be in the afternoon or at night?

591
00:44:55,142 --> 00:44:56,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we have the particulars?

592
00:44:57,303 --> 00:45:03,645
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so it's going to be the interest middle school to 36 is what we're planning right now.

593
00:45:04,945 --> 00:45:20,410
[SPEAKER_15]: We have just about 246 doses I want to say a Pfizer, which is the vaccine that's been approved so it's limited, we'll have the 246, but we really want to use those 246 and get, get these.

594
00:45:27,017 --> 00:45:27,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

595
00:45:27,557 --> 00:45:29,778
[SPEAKER_04]: And how are the how are the kids being notified?

596
00:45:29,838 --> 00:45:33,119
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a robo call going out or verse 911?

597
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:41,723
[SPEAKER_15]: So right now the schools are doing notification, I believe that the first one might actually be going out this evening, via website.

598
00:45:42,443 --> 00:45:46,845
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we will be doing if not tonight, they will be doing the reverse call.

599
00:45:47,245 --> 00:45:50,266
[SPEAKER_15]: But this is not just restricted to the medical schools.

600
00:45:50,947 --> 00:45:51,187
[SPEAKER_15]: Right?

601
00:45:51,247 --> 00:45:56,129
[SPEAKER_15]: This is anybody 12 plus private schools, whatever.

602
00:45:57,546 --> 00:46:03,989
[SPEAKER_15]: are allowed are invited anybody 12 classes invited to come to this clinic.

603
00:46:04,549 --> 00:46:11,052
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, with the with the approval from CDC going forward that we have it by Tuesday.

604
00:46:12,612 --> 00:46:13,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

605
00:46:13,133 --> 00:46:18,195
[SPEAKER_04]: And as far as the talk about the real talk series, that's, did you say that's made 26.

606
00:46:19,667 --> 00:46:21,389
[SPEAKER_15]: May 26 is our date now.

607
00:46:21,449 --> 00:46:23,030
[SPEAKER_15]: We have two great speakers.

608
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:27,735
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to make sure that they're able to, we have them booked for the May 19th date.

609
00:46:27,755 --> 00:46:30,157
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to make sure they can make the May 16th date.

610
00:46:30,677 --> 00:46:43,249
[SPEAKER_15]: Two wonderful speakers, one from the Cambridge Health Alliance, who's the actual director of the Infectious Disease Department, and one from Melrose-Wakefield Hospital, as well as our own Board of Health members.

611
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:45,311
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah.

612
00:46:45,672 --> 00:46:47,853
[SPEAKER_15]: that it's gonna be, we were hoping to do a webinar.

613
00:46:47,873 --> 00:46:54,135
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like it's more gonna be now end up in a Zoom format, but yeah, that would come on that.

614
00:46:54,195 --> 00:47:00,057
[SPEAKER_15]: That should be going out as well as far as a promotion tomorrow on that, but that's May 26th.

615
00:47:00,497 --> 00:47:02,478
[SPEAKER_15]: That'll be in the evening at 6 p.m.

616
00:47:02,498 --> 00:47:06,459
[SPEAKER_15]: And the Zoom link to follow.

617
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:09,100
[SPEAKER_15]: That's just the first, yep.

618
00:47:10,521 --> 00:47:10,841
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

619
00:47:12,965 --> 00:47:18,987
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just gonna say, with regard to the home bond program, so you said you're almost, I believe you're almost complete with that.

620
00:47:19,007 --> 00:47:21,528
[SPEAKER_04]: And what type of vaccine was given out for that?

621
00:47:21,568 --> 00:47:26,810
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I believe at first you said maybe a few weeks ago, Johnson and Johnson, but that may have stopped, right?

622
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:34,072
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so what we're doing this week is basically finishing off the, this will be the second dose for everyone.

623
00:47:34,192 --> 00:47:35,373
[SPEAKER_15]: So we had done Moderna.

624
00:47:36,633 --> 00:47:41,395
[SPEAKER_15]: So the 250 will be finishing off the second dose of Moderna.

625
00:47:41,936 --> 00:47:50,824
[SPEAKER_15]: We had gotten a hundred plus doses of J&J, of the Johnson & Johnson, basically the day before they shut us off.

626
00:47:52,425 --> 00:47:59,391
[SPEAKER_15]: So we still have the J&J, if people are interested, we have done a few of them.

627
00:48:00,812 --> 00:48:03,855
[SPEAKER_15]: Some people are hesitant, we're willing to work with them and talk through it.

628
00:48:04,456 --> 00:48:09,360
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, you know, it's still a very low risk

629
00:48:10,308 --> 00:48:13,071
[SPEAKER_15]: But the risk is the women ages 18 to 55.

630
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:16,934
[SPEAKER_15]: But we are certainly happy to talk through that.

631
00:48:16,954 --> 00:48:18,796
[SPEAKER_15]: But again, that's a very low risk.

632
00:48:19,436 --> 00:48:25,261
[SPEAKER_15]: As far as home on elders and males, the risk is even lower, way lower.

633
00:48:25,882 --> 00:48:29,365
[SPEAKER_15]: So we do have that vaccine available.

634
00:48:30,226 --> 00:48:37,372
[SPEAKER_15]: If people are interested, and they still need homebound vaccines, they certainly can still call us because we do have doses available.

635
00:48:38,984 --> 00:48:39,344
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

636
00:48:39,364 --> 00:48:47,048
[SPEAKER_04]: And last but not least, when we talked previously, you had mentioned the members of the community that are hesitant to the vaccine.

637
00:48:47,488 --> 00:48:52,751
[SPEAKER_04]: And I believe the state was possibly going to come in and help out with the program where they would almost go door to door.

638
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:54,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that still happening or is that going to happen?

639
00:48:55,212 --> 00:48:58,754
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we're still working on that with the mass ambassadors.

640
00:48:59,254 --> 00:49:02,195
[SPEAKER_15]: That's kind of how this Real Talk series came about.

641
00:49:02,936 --> 00:49:05,317
[SPEAKER_15]: And we're looking to fly a door to door.

642
00:49:05,397 --> 00:49:07,098
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I said, we're working with a lot of

643
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:12,717
[SPEAKER_15]: a lot of the faith communities and figuring out the best way to reach out to folks.

644
00:49:14,298 --> 00:49:19,000
[SPEAKER_15]: You gotta look at almost, it's almost like a political campaign, right?

645
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:33,347
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking about going out there and doing door knocks and dropping flyers and talking to people and really getting their questions and concerns and trying to figure out how we can best address those.

646
00:49:33,427 --> 00:49:37,049
[SPEAKER_15]: So we are still reaching out with the mass ambassadors

647
00:49:37,785 --> 00:49:40,067
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's still underway.

648
00:49:40,107 --> 00:49:43,890
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's kind of how the real series talk took off.

649
00:49:44,950 --> 00:49:50,555
[SPEAKER_15]: Not wanting to call it a town hall because it kind of has that government tone to it.

650
00:49:50,895 --> 00:49:54,397
[SPEAKER_15]: So which is part of the hesitancy.

651
00:49:54,938 --> 00:49:59,201
[SPEAKER_15]: We've had folks that don't want to give us their address, you know, don't have insurance.

652
00:49:59,521 --> 00:50:00,522
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's all good.

653
00:50:00,602 --> 00:50:01,223
[SPEAKER_15]: That's fine.

654
00:50:01,283 --> 00:50:02,464
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't need insurance.

655
00:50:02,544 --> 00:50:03,764
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we don't need an address.

656
00:50:04,205 --> 00:50:05,246
[SPEAKER_15]: Just get vaccinated.

657
00:50:06,722 --> 00:50:08,664
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what the message we're trying to get out.

658
00:50:10,185 --> 00:50:12,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

659
00:50:12,906 --> 00:50:13,747
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

660
00:50:14,267 --> 00:50:26,315
[SPEAKER_10]: To follow on with that, before I get to my question, I know that Councilor Falco, thanks for bringing those up, but have we done it, we thought about doing a public press release like, you know, with throughout the community so people feel comfortable that the people that

661
00:50:27,247 --> 00:50:36,769
[SPEAKER_10]: that their neighbors that they trust, like, you know, this council and say, Councilor Scarpelli, I had the Pfizer, I feel great, I feel safe, I'm doing my part.

662
00:50:37,369 --> 00:50:56,672
[SPEAKER_10]: The mayor's office, you know, the school committee, the coaches, the teachers, you know, have we done anything that sort of creative and using a valuable asset, which is a communications director that's very talented, and probably the best public access director

663
00:50:57,085 --> 00:51:03,349
[SPEAKER_10]: and Pat Gordon, I think that, you know, putting all that together, that could be something that could really move mountains.

664
00:51:03,449 --> 00:51:08,291
[SPEAKER_10]: And putting that on the loop, I think that this is something that we can use.

665
00:51:09,112 --> 00:51:14,515
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe if you could share that, Marion, with the mayor, and maybe that'd be something that we can push.

666
00:51:14,535 --> 00:51:17,557
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, no, you're right on, exactly.

667
00:51:17,717 --> 00:51:19,258
[SPEAKER_15]: And we've done that.

668
00:51:19,818 --> 00:51:21,999
[SPEAKER_15]: And hopefully it'll be out soon.

669
00:51:22,039 --> 00:51:23,880
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just final touches being put on it.

670
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,542
[SPEAKER_15]: But we have a video that we put together

671
00:51:27,130 --> 00:51:39,617
[SPEAKER_15]: with just exactly what you laid out with trusted individuals from throughout the community, giving their experience, showing that, you know, the folks that have gotten the vaccine and what it's meant and how they're doing.

672
00:51:39,697 --> 00:51:45,000
[SPEAKER_15]: So that PSA, I guess is what you call it, will be going out.

673
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:55,045
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a video, Sophie in my office, Sophie Antoine worked really hard on that and reached out to a lot of great people in the community and a lot of people responded.

674
00:51:55,577 --> 00:51:59,901
[SPEAKER_15]: So it's a great little video and that will be coming out very soon.

675
00:52:00,822 --> 00:52:03,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so to follow along with that, it's my other question.

676
00:52:03,885 --> 00:52:09,511
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate the openness now to get this process rolling.

677
00:52:10,271 --> 00:52:13,114
[SPEAKER_10]: Great to hear there was zero deaths today, first time in June.

678
00:52:13,715 --> 00:52:14,996
[SPEAKER_10]: The numbers are dropping.

679
00:52:16,573 --> 00:52:19,536
[SPEAKER_10]: but still the responsibility of face coverings and vaccines.

680
00:52:19,956 --> 00:52:29,506
[SPEAKER_10]: You look at this chambers today, we have invested community members that are here to share their opinions or their input in something they would like to share.

681
00:52:29,886 --> 00:52:34,671
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that what I'm hearing from my constituents is maybe looking at the other bodies that aren't

682
00:52:36,971 --> 00:52:43,794
[SPEAKER_10]: opening up a live audience so they can be heard in an open forum.

683
00:52:44,074 --> 00:52:59,461
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that something that the Board of Health is working with, let's say the school committee, other boards and commissions that, believe me, we understand and might be a little in the fact that this is still a pandemic, but we're on the back end.

684
00:52:59,501 --> 00:53:05,644
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that follows along with people that are feeling, that are a little hesitant

685
00:53:06,172 --> 00:53:14,374
[SPEAKER_10]: that when they see their elected officials in person vaccinated, that they're showing them with the good example that we're moving forward.

686
00:53:14,734 --> 00:53:26,977
[SPEAKER_10]: And this was a horrible time, but I think that is that something that's being discussed with the mayor's office as well as opening city hall for the business that needs to be done in the city, Miriam?

687
00:53:26,997 --> 00:53:29,817
[SPEAKER_15]: So we have to go by state guidance.

688
00:53:30,258 --> 00:53:31,398
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what we're under, right?

689
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:42,264
[SPEAKER_15]: Right now, only town halls and city council and those types of meetings, you have a special, your own guidance that you're allowed to operate the way you are.

690
00:53:43,224 --> 00:53:47,126
[SPEAKER_15]: None of those other board sessions have been allowed.

691
00:53:47,186 --> 00:53:49,807
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's, again, state guidance.

692
00:53:49,867 --> 00:53:50,547
[SPEAKER_15]: We're still at 50%.

693
00:53:50,587 --> 00:53:53,348
[SPEAKER_15]: Office space capacity is still 50%.

694
00:53:53,809 --> 00:53:57,010
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what City Hall has to operate under.

695
00:53:58,012 --> 00:54:01,313
[SPEAKER_15]: We have not gone beyond state guidance.

696
00:54:01,333 --> 00:54:06,775
[SPEAKER_15]: We are going with state guidance and you know, that's where we're at.

697
00:54:06,795 --> 00:54:07,515
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate it.

698
00:54:07,795 --> 00:54:26,581
[SPEAKER_10]: It just, you know, the concerns that I've been, you know, I heard, you know, the great news, we can now put 50% of the people at amusement parks and we can now have everybody go to baseball games, but the office, these public meetings are still closed off for our community members.

699
00:54:27,588 --> 00:54:32,131
[SPEAKER_10]: They're asking me, so I appreciate you pointing out that this is a state guideline.

700
00:54:32,171 --> 00:54:38,215
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is something they really need to get to Governor Baker and move that along.

701
00:54:39,697 --> 00:54:45,561
[SPEAKER_10]: It's coming to me and they appreciate the work that we've done on the city council helping these chambers.

702
00:54:45,601 --> 00:54:57,129
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that I've gotten maybe 10 phone calls in the last week and a half with some concerns that they've had in other boards and commissions and committees that they really want a form that they can see in person.

703
00:54:57,879 --> 00:55:00,640
[SPEAKER_10]: at least the answer comes from our director of health and I appreciate that.

704
00:55:01,641 --> 00:55:07,004
[SPEAKER_10]: The last question I have is I know a few weeks back, we hired the COVID director of emergency operations.

705
00:55:07,084 --> 00:55:12,086
[SPEAKER_10]: I truly don't know the actual title, but what is exactly that person doing?

706
00:55:12,106 --> 00:55:13,807
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there any updates on what that person's doing?

707
00:55:17,909 --> 00:55:20,030
[SPEAKER_15]: You'll have to refer to the communications?

708
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,552
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I believe we hired,

709
00:55:24,485 --> 00:55:28,067
[SPEAKER_10]: somebody in the field to oversee the COVID response?

710
00:55:30,128 --> 00:55:37,071
[SPEAKER_15]: Brooke has been working since, gosh, no, it wasn't recently, but yes, she has been, she transitioned over.

711
00:55:38,291 --> 00:55:49,576
[SPEAKER_15]: She had been being paid with CARES Act, and I'm actually asking to add to the budget this year, that position because it was really reckoning like solely,

712
00:55:51,385 --> 00:55:56,848
[SPEAKER_15]: recognize that this was a position we were lacking within the community when this hit.

713
00:55:57,709 --> 00:56:14,458
[SPEAKER_15]: So Brooke, who had already been like an emergency preparedness person and an MRC person long before I even came here under a grant, luckily she was still here under a different grant, but we were able to transition her and she's been amazing.

714
00:56:14,718 --> 00:56:20,902
[SPEAKER_15]: She's been the volunteer coordinator person, the MRC person,

715
00:56:21,328 --> 00:56:37,199
[SPEAKER_15]: We've been able to pay her so far under the CARES Act, but I am certainly looking to add that position going forward in this fiscal, this next fiscal year as a position, because it was incredibly obvious that that's what we were lacking when this hit.

716
00:56:37,999 --> 00:56:39,861
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate that clarification as well.

717
00:56:39,881 --> 00:56:40,401
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you.

718
00:56:41,582 --> 00:56:42,162
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Belco.

719
00:56:42,182 --> 00:56:43,663
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

720
00:56:43,683 --> 00:56:46,285
[SPEAKER_04]: Marion, I have one last question I forgot to ask.

721
00:56:46,877 --> 00:56:49,919
[SPEAKER_04]: So I know we're doing outreach to our public school families.

722
00:56:49,959 --> 00:56:52,742
[SPEAKER_04]: What about our Catholic school or parochial school, St.

723
00:56:52,982 --> 00:56:53,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Ray's, St.

724
00:56:53,482 --> 00:56:53,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Joe's?

725
00:56:53,882 --> 00:56:57,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we reaching out to those parents, those populations to make sure that they know?

726
00:56:58,126 --> 00:57:00,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

727
00:57:00,487 --> 00:57:01,528
[SPEAKER_15]: Absolutely, yeah.

728
00:57:01,548 --> 00:57:02,569
[SPEAKER_15]: We want to make that clear.

729
00:57:02,829 --> 00:57:04,971
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, even if you don't go to St.

730
00:57:04,991 --> 00:57:05,611
[SPEAKER_15]: Ray's or St.

731
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:12,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Joe's, if you go to, you know, whatever school, wherever, if you live in Medford, if you don't,

732
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,981
[SPEAKER_15]: And we just want to get vaccines, we want to get shots.

733
00:57:16,241 --> 00:57:31,970
[SPEAKER_15]: So any 12 year old plus, if you're willing to, if we can pull this off on Tuesday, which I'm almost 100% sure that we'll get CDC approval by this weekend with guidelines, we'll be able to put this in place on Tuesday.

734
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:34,991
[SPEAKER_15]: So yeah, please, anybody, everybody.

735
00:57:36,212 --> 00:57:40,074
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, like I said, like the majority of our cases are under 29 years old.

736
00:57:43,455 --> 00:57:47,898
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, unfortunately there are 20 year olds on vents right now in hospitals.

737
00:57:48,018 --> 00:57:56,303
[SPEAKER_15]: So, you know, 20 year old and younger are not invincible as I know my kids think they are.

738
00:57:57,423 --> 00:57:59,184
[SPEAKER_15]: So we need to get vaccines.

739
00:57:59,244 --> 00:58:00,725
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to get shots in their arms.

740
00:58:02,927 --> 00:58:05,768
[SPEAKER_04]: But is the outreach being done from your office to St.

741
00:58:05,828 --> 00:58:06,589
[SPEAKER_04]: Ray's and St.

742
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:07,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Joe's to those schools?

743
00:58:09,213 --> 00:58:10,313
[SPEAKER_15]: That'll come from my office.

744
00:58:10,333 --> 00:58:19,476
[SPEAKER_15]: The outreach to the Medford Public Schools will go from Medford Public Schools, but the outreach, the other, and the general, the community at large will come from my office.

745
00:58:21,376 --> 00:58:24,957
[SPEAKER_15]: We're just waiting, we don't, we're just waiting for the CDC to sign off.

746
00:58:26,397 --> 00:58:30,438
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just wanna, so as far as, so is it a robo-call to everyone in the community?

747
00:58:30,558 --> 00:58:35,420
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it is that, is someone directly calling those schools saying these shots are available?

748
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:36,040
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my question.

749
00:58:37,010 --> 00:58:42,913
[SPEAKER_15]: We have relationships with those schools, certainly since the pandemic.

750
00:58:44,733 --> 00:58:46,254
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

751
00:58:50,096 --> 00:58:56,339
[SPEAKER_07]: So from what I'm gathering, Brooke Hoyt has been appointed the COVID communication specialist?

752
00:58:58,419 --> 00:59:00,660
[SPEAKER_15]: No, she's our emergency preparedness person.

753
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:02,121
[SPEAKER_15]: She's our volunteer coordinator.

754
00:59:04,338 --> 00:59:07,019
[SPEAKER_15]: communication specialist is a different position.

755
00:59:09,019 --> 00:59:10,440
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, can we talk a little bit about that?

756
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:15,501
[SPEAKER_15]: So I wasn't sure which one you, I don't think it was talking about the communication specialist.

757
00:59:17,062 --> 00:59:18,742
[SPEAKER_07]: George, maybe you can clarify.

758
00:59:18,802 --> 00:59:24,124
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you were talking about the communications person or if you were talking about the emergency plan.

759
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:25,724
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what the confusion was.

760
00:59:26,145 --> 00:59:33,867
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that this is something that we hired just recently, this position that we just hired recently to deal with the COVID emergency plan.

761
00:59:34,517 --> 00:59:38,779
[SPEAKER_10]: So I, it was a, I believe it was a Mia's appointment.

762
00:59:38,899 --> 00:59:42,602
[SPEAKER_15]: I was- That might be the communication specialist.

763
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:44,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Myrtle or something, Stephanie?

764
00:59:44,943 --> 00:59:45,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Myrtle?

765
00:59:45,683 --> 00:59:48,565
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is Steve Sperry.

766
00:59:50,746 --> 00:59:51,046
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that?

767
00:59:52,327 --> 00:59:52,967
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

768
00:59:53,007 --> 00:59:59,851
[SPEAKER_07]: You tell us, Marianne, but I think what we're trying to find out is who the COVID communication specialist is that we just approved a position for a couple of weeks ago.

769
00:59:59,891 --> 01:00:00,872
[SPEAKER_07]: Has that position been filled?

770
01:00:00,912 --> 01:00:01,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Who's in it?

771
01:00:02,193 --> 01:00:02,753
[SPEAKER_15]: That's yeah.

772
01:00:03,206 --> 01:00:10,448
[SPEAKER_15]: That would be Steve, and he's been instrumental in helping us get a lot of the communications out.

773
01:00:10,528 --> 01:00:17,929
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, he has been hired as the COVID communication specialist for the last couple of weeks, and thank God he was.

774
01:00:19,209 --> 01:00:19,870
[SPEAKER_15]: But yes.

775
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:30,072
[SPEAKER_10]: So what I'm asking is, because I don't, I'm confused because you just said someone else's name that was a communication person.

776
01:00:31,662 --> 01:00:34,185
[SPEAKER_10]: So Steve is the person, Marion?

777
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:51,303
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, so you had said the emergency preparedness person, so that would be Brooke, but Steve is the communications, COVID communications specific, was hired a few weeks ago to come on board.

778
01:00:51,763 --> 01:00:53,205
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't hire Steve, so.

779
01:00:54,207 --> 01:00:56,968
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so does he work under you, or do you work with him?

780
01:00:57,369 --> 01:00:58,569
[SPEAKER_15]: We work under Jackie.

781
01:00:58,649 --> 01:01:04,832
[SPEAKER_15]: Jackie's amazingly talented and creative, but she cannot certainly handle all the communications, including the COVID stuff.

782
01:01:05,273 --> 01:01:14,718
[SPEAKER_15]: So they hired Steve on to assist her, I believe, with, you know, and he's certainly part of our team right now, as far as helping us get all these messages out.

783
01:01:15,518 --> 01:01:21,361
[SPEAKER_15]: But he works, he does not report to me, he reports to our communications director, Jackie.

784
01:01:22,213 --> 01:01:22,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, thank you.

785
01:01:22,853 --> 01:01:24,114
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's all I was trying to get at.

786
01:01:24,154 --> 01:01:46,122
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that we approved a position for this COVID position that I truly forgot, but I looked through my notes and so the question is probably better off for Jackie, because just to get an update of what, if he's doing communications for COVID, there's some questions.

787
01:01:46,182 --> 01:01:48,343
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'll direct that to Jackie.

788
01:01:48,363 --> 01:01:48,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

789
01:01:49,963 --> 01:01:50,644
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

790
01:01:52,425 --> 01:02:06,895
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I'm understanding is that the COVID-19 communication coordinator does not work for the Board of Health, the COVID-19 communication coordinator works in the press department, the city's press department?

791
01:02:07,976 --> 01:02:21,746
[SPEAKER_15]: He reports to the expert in communications, yes, but he certainly has been working with us very closely as part of our team and directing us on how to best do and get messaging out, but then he

792
01:02:22,547 --> 01:02:27,768
[SPEAKER_15]: obviously checks with Jackie to make sure that that's the right way to go.

793
01:02:27,988 --> 01:02:30,828
[SPEAKER_07]: No, he does not work for the board of health.

794
01:02:32,829 --> 01:02:33,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

795
01:02:33,969 --> 01:02:37,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions?

796
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:50,252
[SPEAKER_15]: The only last thing I want to put out there is that, again, we have all you know that the cancer center is open on Wednesdays and Thursdays from 11 to four, we're not getting.

797
01:02:52,362 --> 01:02:54,563
[SPEAKER_15]: They're opening up to walk-ins.

798
01:02:54,963 --> 01:02:56,224
[SPEAKER_15]: You don't have to have an appointment.

799
01:02:56,364 --> 01:02:59,725
[SPEAKER_15]: We really want to encourage people to go there.

800
01:03:00,605 --> 01:03:03,686
[SPEAKER_15]: We asked not getting the participation that we were hoping for.

801
01:03:03,706 --> 01:03:11,369
[SPEAKER_15]: And the concern is if we don't continue to get participation that we may not be able to sustain that.

802
01:03:11,529 --> 01:03:18,072
[SPEAKER_15]: So any help and walk-ins are available Wednesday and Thursday, please get vaccine.

803
01:03:25,587 --> 01:03:32,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Marianne.

804
01:03:34,351 --> 01:03:34,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Marianne.

805
01:03:35,951 --> 01:03:38,012
[SPEAKER_06]: The orders of the day by council name.

806
01:03:38,032 --> 01:03:50,837

[SPEAKER_06]: Respectfully submitted.

819
01:05:24,424 --> 01:05:26,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Random random one.

820
01:05:26,325 --> 01:05:27,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's better.

821
01:05:28,306 --> 01:05:28,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Scott belly.

822
01:05:29,527 --> 01:05:35,090
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there someone from the city administration just to ask a question just about the as I'm reading this?

823
01:05:36,371 --> 01:05:40,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Is the seal of way to measures its own own position?

824
01:05:40,433 --> 01:05:42,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is it now go up somewhere else?

825
01:05:42,414 --> 01:05:44,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that's what I believe it was.

826
01:05:44,455 --> 01:05:47,497
[SPEAKER_06]: Alicia, not me, Benjamin.

827
01:05:47,937 --> 01:05:49,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you answer that question?

828
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:52,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Felicia.

829
01:05:55,461 --> 01:05:56,982
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening, honorable Councilors.

830
01:05:57,082 --> 01:06:07,925
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe in this CAF, the sealer weights and measures is its own position, but currently I believe we don't have a sealers and weights measure position and said it's paid as a stipend.

831
01:06:07,945 --> 01:06:10,166
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

832
01:06:10,306 --> 01:06:12,827
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you know what moving forward in the future budget?

833
01:06:13,187 --> 01:06:14,588
[SPEAKER_10]: Is this going to be a standalone position?

834
01:06:14,608 --> 01:06:18,669
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we looking for somebody or is this going to be absorbed into another position, Felicia?

835
01:06:20,673 --> 01:06:30,924
[SPEAKER_20]: To the chair, I'm not aware of it being presented as a new position, but again, I'd have to check back with the mayor, but as of my knowledge, I don't believe so.

836
01:06:33,367 --> 01:06:37,952
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't believe so that it's still gonna have its own title or it's gonna still be absorbed?

837
01:06:39,147 --> 01:06:39,888
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe it's good.

838
01:06:39,968 --> 01:06:52,120
[SPEAKER_20]: I believe what is happening here is they're leaving that alone and they're just adding a position to it at some time in the past in the history was its own position, but it's not its own position anymore.

839
01:06:53,989 --> 01:06:55,170
[SPEAKER_07]: We have information on that, Mr. President.

840
01:06:55,190 --> 01:07:03,855
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the information, Vice President Knight, I'm confused as to how we can have a city ordinance that dictates we have a sealer of weights and measures that's going to be compensated at a certain rate of pay.

841
01:07:04,015 --> 01:07:09,839
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the administration decides that the ordinance doesn't exist and goes and creates a position that's a stipend job and gives it to somebody else.

842
01:07:12,621 --> 01:07:15,943
[SPEAKER_20]: Through the chair, that's historically how it's been since I've been.

843
01:07:16,143 --> 01:07:19,345
[SPEAKER_20]: I have not seen it as its own position.

844
01:07:20,733 --> 01:07:21,393
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe it's a stipend.

845
01:07:21,413 --> 01:07:22,414
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe that's what it is.

846
01:07:22,554 --> 01:07:25,335
[SPEAKER_10]: If I'm incorrect, I apologize, but I believe it's a stipend.

847
01:07:25,435 --> 01:07:25,636
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

848
01:07:25,656 --> 01:07:26,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

849
01:07:26,116 --> 01:07:26,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe I'm

850
01:07:50,959 --> 01:07:52,460
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Knight, did you want the floor?

851
01:07:53,180 --> 01:07:58,141
[SPEAKER_07]: I just, sometimes I scratch my head and wonder why we have ordinances, Mr. President, if we're not going to go by them.

852
01:07:58,161 --> 01:08:01,743
[SPEAKER_07]: We also can hope to uphold the ordinances of the community.

853
01:08:01,783 --> 01:08:07,505
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it seems to me like a lot of the time, you know, the ordinances are only read when it's convenient to the person that's reasonable.

854
01:08:09,285 --> 01:08:19,809
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so this has been, this ordinance has been discussed at length with several community hall meetings.

855
01:08:22,173 --> 01:08:24,014
[SPEAKER_06]: was voted on last week.

856
01:08:24,034 --> 01:08:30,035
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you need the procedure, we want to vote on each amendment separately.

857
01:08:33,095 --> 01:08:38,156
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion by Vice President Knight to approve amendment A, seconded by.

858
01:08:40,956 --> 01:08:43,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

859
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:50,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

860
01:08:50,862 --> 01:08:51,502
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Bears.

861
01:08:52,143 --> 01:08:52,383
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

862
01:08:52,803 --> 01:08:54,044
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

863
01:08:54,625 --> 01:08:54,865
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

864
01:08:55,485 --> 01:08:56,206
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Knight.

865
01:08:56,506 --> 01:08:56,786
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

866
01:08:57,106 --> 01:08:57,707
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

867
01:08:57,967 --> 01:08:58,267
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

868
01:08:58,728 --> 01:08:59,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Morell.

869
01:08:59,928 --> 01:09:00,189
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

870
01:09:01,029 --> 01:09:01,810
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli.

871
01:09:02,110 --> 01:09:02,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

872
01:09:02,951 --> 01:09:03,711
[SPEAKER_11]: President Caraviello.

873
01:09:03,791 --> 01:09:05,692
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I'm in the affirmative motion passes.

874
01:09:06,093 --> 01:09:08,434
[SPEAKER_06]: Amendment B. Motion to approve.

875
01:09:10,476 --> 01:09:13,078
[SPEAKER_06]: The motion by Councilor Bears to approve.

876
01:09:13,898 --> 01:09:14,679
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by.

877
01:09:14,699 --> 01:09:15,379
[SPEAKER_06]: Second.

878
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:17,621
[SPEAKER_06]: Seconded by Councilor Morell.

879
01:09:21,777 --> 01:09:22,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. President.

880
01:09:22,917 --> 01:09:23,618
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Falco.

881
01:09:24,298 --> 01:09:26,999
[SPEAKER_04]: So just to try to make sure I have this right.

882
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:35,141
[SPEAKER_04]: So the motion is to make the diversity director of human resources part of cap 19.

883
01:09:35,602 --> 01:09:37,922
[SPEAKER_04]: So that would be joining the two positions, if I'm correct.

884
01:09:40,383 --> 01:09:51,627
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that it was amended B is adding a position that did not exist in the past, which is the director of diversity

885
01:09:52,145 --> 01:09:53,226
[SPEAKER_06]: and human resources.

886
01:09:54,006 --> 01:10:04,992
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think we voted, not mistaken, we voted to me the whole meeting to eliminate that position and that's how it was reported out.

887
01:10:07,053 --> 01:10:10,755
[SPEAKER_07]: You are correct.

888
01:10:10,835 --> 01:10:11,615
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Knight.

889
01:10:11,936 --> 01:10:20,000
[SPEAKER_07]: The way that I'm looking at this vote, Mr. President, is that we're eliminating the office of diversity and inclusion and we're merging those functions with the human resource office.

890
01:10:20,610 --> 01:10:23,451
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think this council has been loud and clear that that's not what we want.

891
01:10:23,551 --> 01:10:24,031
[SPEAKER_07]: That's correct.

892
01:10:24,131 --> 01:10:25,872
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to, we want to see a president to diversity.

893
01:10:26,672 --> 01:10:30,193
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I certainly have no problem voting against this amendment.

894
01:10:30,313 --> 01:10:32,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

895
01:10:32,694 --> 01:10:33,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, I apologize.

896
01:10:33,695 --> 01:10:35,075
[SPEAKER_10]: I know this is very important.

897
01:10:35,095 --> 01:10:37,256
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I mentioned it at the first meeting.

898
01:10:37,276 --> 01:10:49,440
[SPEAKER_10]: I know we've had many, but as we, as we've gone through the round table discussions about race in our community, one of the biggest, biggest initiatives that we're

899
01:10:49,885 --> 01:11:01,148
[SPEAKER_10]: that was said over and over again, is when the words are great, the meetings are great, but when is this community gonna put their money where their mouth is?

900
01:11:01,328 --> 01:11:16,792
[SPEAKER_10]: And one of the things we talked about, I think I said it then, was in those discussions, the round table discussions, is that the glaring problem of not having a diversity specialist that works with the school,

901
01:11:17,478 --> 01:11:26,363
[SPEAKER_10]: And having that person that's in the city side, working with the school department together with the city side would be monumental and moving some huge initiatives forward.

902
01:11:26,783 --> 01:11:43,973
[SPEAKER_10]: So again, I apologize because I have been, I did miss that meeting with dealing with the family issue, but I just can't support this in any way, especially what we've been talking about in this community for the last

903
01:11:44,890 --> 01:11:46,592
[SPEAKER_10]: of teen months.

904
01:11:47,292 --> 01:12:06,450
[SPEAKER_10]: This is exactly what we talked about, putting money where our mouth is, putting the person in that position who's valuable in that position to go out and increase his role, both working with what he did in the private sector and his knowledge in the community.

905
01:12:07,071 --> 01:12:08,933
[SPEAKER_10]: And it would be valuable

906
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:25,147
[SPEAKER_10]: to have that person go right to the school system yesterday and start working together with the school department, the city side, to get to some resolutions to show our community that yes, we're not just having marches, we're not just talking around tables, but we're actually making things happen.

907
01:12:25,187 --> 01:12:26,468
[SPEAKER_10]: So thank you, Mr. President.

908
01:12:27,008 --> 01:12:27,709
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Galco.

909
01:12:28,149 --> 01:12:28,950
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

910
01:12:28,970 --> 01:12:30,010
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank my colleagues.

911
01:12:30,090 --> 01:12:33,833
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had numerous meetings, numerous Committee of the Whole meetings on this topic.

912
01:12:34,534 --> 01:12:36,575
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've had a lot of valuable discussion.

913
01:12:37,036 --> 01:12:38,777
[SPEAKER_04]: And I still like to go back and look at the metrics.

914
01:12:39,319 --> 01:12:42,580
[SPEAKER_04]: We have 58,000, probably close to 58,000 people in this city.

915
01:12:44,021 --> 01:12:46,581
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably about 4,000 students around there.

916
01:12:47,722 --> 01:12:51,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Hundreds of employees in our school system and in our city.

917
01:12:53,524 --> 01:12:58,805
[SPEAKER_04]: We are one of the largest cities in the Commonwealth by population.

918
01:12:58,825 --> 01:13:03,387
[SPEAKER_04]: We have no one specifically in the school system that is responsible for diversity and inclusion.

919
01:13:04,756 --> 01:13:09,519
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a piece of someone's job, but no one is not a person that's solely responsible for that.

920
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:14,942
[SPEAKER_04]: Diversity and inclusion within our school system and within our city should be a priority.

921
01:13:16,162 --> 01:13:22,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes an issue comes before this council that is as much timely as it is important.

922
01:13:23,627 --> 01:13:25,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Diversity is just such an issue.

923
01:13:26,768 --> 01:13:33,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanna make it abundantly clear that in my view, it is time to move the diversity issue from talk to reality.

924
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:38,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Raising the reality of inclusion and equity is not a part-time effort.

925
01:13:39,634 --> 01:13:47,460
[SPEAKER_04]: It requires the attentive focus of a full-time diversity officer who has time to see the issue at every level.

926
01:13:49,322 --> 01:13:55,667
[SPEAKER_04]: This includes hiring practices to help make sure that the faces in City Hall reflect the faces of our community.

927
01:13:57,308 --> 01:14:02,172
[SPEAKER_04]: And it also includes the continual analysis of our municipal contracts.

928
01:14:03,481 --> 01:14:06,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Who are the companies that we have, that we contract with?

929
01:14:07,524 --> 01:14:12,807
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the percentage of contracts that the city has with minority businesses or businesses that are owned by women?

930
01:14:14,108 --> 01:14:16,570
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to move from talk to action.

931
01:14:17,971 --> 01:14:24,235
[SPEAKER_04]: I want Mr. Osborne to know that my objection to the mayor's request is not a reflection on his abilities or his professionalism.

932
01:14:26,066 --> 01:14:32,727
[SPEAKER_04]: It is about what the city needs, and it is time that we meet the need of diversity and inclusion head on.

933
01:14:33,227 --> 01:14:35,368
[SPEAKER_04]: And the mayor's request does not do that.

934
01:14:35,928 --> 01:14:36,768
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

935
01:14:37,128 --> 01:14:37,468
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

936
01:14:37,968 --> 01:14:38,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Morell.

937
01:14:39,268 --> 01:14:40,008
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mr. President.

938
01:14:40,028 --> 01:14:44,989
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I just want to note that my vote is going to reflect the work that's being done right now.

939
01:14:45,089 --> 01:14:54,311
[SPEAKER_16]: And as the mayor has structured it, I too want to see, you know, the full time, I want to see the diversity department built out essentially, and all I can do is act on

940
01:14:54,721 --> 01:14:59,302
[SPEAKER_16]: the information that the administration has given us that they are going to build out this department in the coming budget.

941
01:14:59,702 --> 01:15:01,002
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not something they can do tomorrow.

942
01:15:01,062 --> 01:15:11,965
[SPEAKER_16]: And again, my vote is just reflecting the work that is going on right now that is being taken on by the one person and the hard work that they're doing and reflecting the current structure and ensuring that it's paymently.

943
01:15:12,225 --> 01:15:12,565
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

944
01:15:13,405 --> 01:15:13,745
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

945
01:15:14,465 --> 01:15:17,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks.

946
01:15:17,166 --> 01:15:18,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

947
01:15:18,446 --> 01:15:19,866
[SPEAKER_09]: Make no mistake about this.

948
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:23,927
[SPEAKER_09]: A vote to merge the director of diversity

949
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:30,927
[SPEAKER_09]: human resource director is a vote to take a step backwards regarding diversity in this community.

950
01:15:31,247 --> 01:15:32,488
[SPEAKER_09]: Make no bones about it.

951
01:15:32,928 --> 01:15:36,431
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Falco was a thousand percent correct, Mr. President.

952
01:15:37,192 --> 01:15:52,944
[SPEAKER_09]: A vote tonight to support that will be a vote to do away with the director, a standalone director position that has existed for years in this community with the sole responsibility of looking at diversity through a lens of this community.

953
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:54,701
[SPEAKER_09]: and the people that live in this community.

954
01:15:55,221 --> 01:15:58,863
[SPEAKER_09]: So in my opinion, it's taking a step, a giant step backwards.

955
01:15:59,303 --> 01:16:09,127
[SPEAKER_09]: This council also met within the past year, Mr. President, seven of us and discussed and put together a list of priorities that we voted on unanimously.

956
01:16:09,607 --> 01:16:17,511
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of the votes was not to merge this position, it was to keep a standalone diversity director.

957
01:16:17,921 --> 01:16:20,402
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a vote seven zero, Mr. President.

958
01:16:20,882 --> 01:16:23,342
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, we've been consistent on this issue.

959
01:16:23,743 --> 01:16:30,084
[SPEAKER_09]: If others want to flip flop back and forth, that's their call, but we've been consistent on this issue, Mr. President.

960
01:16:30,344 --> 01:16:38,527
[SPEAKER_09]: And now's the time to stand up against the administration and say, this is far too important of a position to have it go by the wayside.

961
01:16:38,787 --> 01:16:39,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

962
01:16:40,367 --> 01:16:41,047
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bearsley.

963
01:16:42,488 --> 01:16:43,448
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

964
01:16:44,428 --> 01:16:47,269
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it would be remiss to say that the person who holds this position right now

965
01:16:48,090 --> 01:16:50,311
[SPEAKER_18]: thinks that this is working and that this is a good idea.

966
01:16:50,831 --> 01:16:52,491
[SPEAKER_18]: So I just wanna acknowledge that.

967
01:16:54,372 --> 01:16:57,313
[SPEAKER_18]: I agree, we need to invest deeply in diversity inclusion.

968
01:16:57,473 --> 01:17:04,215
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think one of the actions that we can take is and show that diversity is a priority is elevating this position.

969
01:17:05,235 --> 01:17:15,118
[SPEAKER_18]: Additionally, in our meeting, the mayor committed to another full-time diversity staff reporting to this position, which would bring us from one staff in 2018 to two staff next year.

970
01:17:17,192 --> 01:17:21,294
[SPEAKER_18]: We've heard from the current person who holds this position, Mr. Osborne, that it's working.

971
01:17:22,575 --> 01:17:25,757
[SPEAKER_18]: And he said this is partially about valuing the work that he is doing.

972
01:17:26,557 --> 01:17:32,981
[SPEAKER_18]: It has led to new hiring processes, exactly what we were just talking about, that highlight and advance the issues of diversity and inclusion.

973
01:17:33,441 --> 01:17:40,445
[SPEAKER_18]: And additionally, we heard at the meeting from the mayor's staff that this could potentially lead to a reduction in pay for the person who currently holds the office.

974
01:17:40,685 --> 01:17:44,788
[SPEAKER_18]: I cannot vote to reduce the pay of someone who is doing so much work for this community.

975
01:17:44,948 --> 01:17:46,709
[SPEAKER_18]: So I will be voting to approve this tonight.

976
01:17:47,314 --> 01:17:55,176
[SPEAKER_18]: and continuing our commitment within the budget process to have even more people focused on diversity and inclusion in this community.

977
01:17:55,496 --> 01:17:55,856
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

978
01:17:57,377 --> 01:17:58,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you Councilman Haynes.

979
01:17:58,217 --> 01:17:59,877
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further discussion?

980
01:18:00,258 --> 01:18:01,218
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, if I may.

981
01:18:01,838 --> 01:18:02,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Knight.

982
01:18:02,718 --> 01:18:11,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Seems to me like the city administration's committed to creating a lot of new jobs and a budget during this hiring freeze that you talked about Thursday night, I believe.

983
01:18:12,441 --> 01:18:16,622
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when we look at this position in particular, this isn't something that just came out of the blue.

984
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:19,833
[SPEAKER_07]: This isn't something that just came out of the blue.

985
01:18:19,853 --> 01:18:26,997
[SPEAKER_07]: On January 1st, 2020, this council passed a resolution questioning the merger of this position.

986
01:18:27,597 --> 01:18:29,378
[SPEAKER_07]: That's some 17 months ago, Mr. President.

987
01:18:29,398 --> 01:18:32,440
[SPEAKER_07]: This council was on record questioning whether or not this was a good idea.

988
01:18:32,460 --> 01:18:37,182
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've maintained consistency and we've been steadfast in our position on this.

989
01:18:37,782 --> 01:18:46,147
[SPEAKER_07]: So when the city administration responded to it and said they don't feel as though it's a conflict of interest when the diversity director would also sit on the hiring panel

990
01:18:46,852 --> 01:18:55,316
[SPEAKER_07]: And if someone who didn't get a position felt as though they were discriminated against or had an issue, they'd have to go to the diversity director who's a member of the hiring panel.

991
01:18:58,058 --> 01:18:59,279
[SPEAKER_07]: Who is that person servicing?

992
01:18:59,599 --> 01:19:02,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Is he servicing the hiring panel and the administration as a member of the hiring panel?

993
01:19:02,980 --> 01:19:06,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Or is he working as a director of diversity to address the issues that the person is bringing to them?

994
01:19:06,562 --> 01:19:08,683
[SPEAKER_07]: I think councilor Falco hit the nail on the head.

995
01:19:09,464 --> 01:19:12,385
[SPEAKER_07]: The city of Medford is one of the largest employers in the city of Medford.

996
01:19:12,525 --> 01:19:13,626
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a ton of employees.

997
01:19:14,266 --> 01:19:15,347
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to make a commitment to this.

998
01:19:15,945 --> 01:19:41,737
[SPEAKER_07]: So when we look at the history of the position and we see the council speaking out against it in January of 2020, the city administration initiating a personnel action form in January of 2020, the city administration initiating another personnel action form on 3-23-2020 with another pay increase, and then the city administration implementing another personnel action form on 10-22-2020 with another pay increase,

999
01:19:45,503 --> 01:19:47,545
[SPEAKER_07]: It seems as though no one's listening to what this council is saying.

1000
01:19:48,586 --> 01:19:51,268
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I'm going to stand with my council colleagues, Mr. President.

1001
01:19:51,568 --> 01:19:53,090
[SPEAKER_07]: The commitment to diversity has to be real.

1002
01:19:53,110 --> 01:19:55,031
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be spun any way you want to spin it.

1003
01:19:55,211 --> 01:19:57,934
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the end of the day, the council has been speaking about this for 17 months.

1004
01:19:57,974 --> 01:19:59,455
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've been saying this isn't something we want.

1005
01:20:03,078 --> 01:20:03,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1006
01:20:04,439 --> 01:20:05,360
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further discussion?

1007
01:20:07,066 --> 01:20:11,488
[SPEAKER_06]: On the motion by Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Morell.

1008
01:20:11,528 --> 01:20:15,910
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a vote similar to the first one, but this will take its first reading.

1009
01:20:17,751 --> 01:20:19,652
[SPEAKER_06]: So Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1010
01:20:20,832 --> 01:20:21,472
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Bears.

1011
01:20:21,952 --> 01:20:22,253
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1012
01:20:23,413 --> 01:20:24,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

1013
01:20:24,213 --> 01:20:24,614
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1014
01:20:25,434 --> 01:20:26,174
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Knight.

1015
01:20:26,434 --> 01:20:26,795
No.

1016
01:20:27,255 --> 01:20:27,855
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

1017
01:20:28,155 --> 01:20:28,455
No.

1018
01:20:28,955 --> 01:20:29,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Morell.

1019
01:20:30,016 --> 01:20:30,276
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1020
01:20:31,577 --> 01:20:32,357
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Scarpelli.

1021
01:20:32,477 --> 01:20:32,677
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

1022
01:20:33,417 --> 01:20:34,278
[SPEAKER_06]: President Caraviello-Villa.

1023
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:34,598
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

1024
01:20:35,983 --> 01:20:37,544
[SPEAKER_06]: Two in the affirmative, five in the negative.

1025
01:20:38,185 --> 01:20:38,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion passes.

1026
01:20:39,827 --> 01:20:40,768
[SPEAKER_06]: Motion fails.

1027
01:20:41,309 --> 01:20:47,937
[SPEAKER_06]: So the amendment A will take its first reading tonight and it will be further advertised.

1028
01:20:48,497 --> 01:20:48,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1029
01:20:53,219 --> 01:21:07,422
[SPEAKER_06]: 2, 1, 3, 6, 9, members of the city council, dear Mr. President, city councilors, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves the appropriation of retained earnings in the amount of $500,000 and zero cents.

1030
01:21:07,982 --> 01:21:22,205
[SPEAKER_06]: This amount is being requested to subsidize the fiscal 2022 Water and Sewer Enterprise Fund budget due to the health and pandemic, health pandemic and current economic conditions.

1031
01:21:22,562 --> 01:21:25,483
[SPEAKER_06]: Retained earnings are reserves of the Water and Sewer Fund.

1032
01:21:25,883 --> 01:21:36,725
[SPEAKER_06]: Reserves can be used for any lawful purpose, which serve primarily to provide financial security in cases of unforeseen events, such as COVID-19 or capital replacement.

1033
01:21:37,065 --> 01:21:40,345
[SPEAKER_06]: The balance of retained earnings for this vote is $6,059,512.

1034
01:21:41,806 --> 01:21:48,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Finance Director Alicia Nunday Benjamin is here to answer any significant questions against the matter.

1035
01:21:48,873 --> 01:21:49,834
[SPEAKER_06]: the CLE Brianna.

1036
01:21:49,854 --> 01:21:52,996
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor, Alicia, brief some options on this.

1037
01:21:54,717 --> 01:21:56,858
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you honorable president, honorable councilors.

1038
01:21:57,098 --> 01:22:12,809
[SPEAKER_20]: I was at the Water and Sewer Commission rate setting meeting and the mayor has decided to appropriate $500,000 to subsidize the budget to make the rate increase be 3% for the next year, which is consistent with last year.

1039
01:22:12,829 --> 01:22:13,349
[SPEAKER_20]: It was a 3% increase.

1040
01:22:15,007 --> 01:22:19,350
[SPEAKER_20]: without the $500,000 transfer, the increase to the rate pay would be 5%.

1041
01:22:23,132 --> 01:22:25,013
[SPEAKER_06]: Questions for Alicia Dundley?

1042
01:22:26,474 --> 01:22:26,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions?

1043
01:22:28,415 --> 01:22:31,056
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks.

1044
01:22:31,076 --> 01:22:34,078
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President, and I appreciate we have the finance director on.

1045
01:22:35,719 --> 01:22:39,021
[SPEAKER_09]: In the past, in this finance director, Alicia has been around for a while.

1046
01:22:39,041 --> 01:22:42,423
[SPEAKER_09]: There's always been discussion about tapping into our,

1047
01:22:42,857 --> 01:22:47,479
[SPEAKER_09]: retained earnings or free cash because it may impact the bond rating.

1048
01:22:48,199 --> 01:23:00,185
[SPEAKER_09]: I was just wondering at what point in this particular account, if we were to vote for a higher dollar amount, would that impact our bond rating?

1049
01:23:02,472 --> 01:23:04,794
[SPEAKER_09]: or the potential of our impact?

1050
01:23:05,154 --> 01:23:19,567
[SPEAKER_20]: The reason for the 500,000 and the 3% is to keep it minimal because if you use more money to subsidize and reduce the rate, once your reserves are gone, the users would have rate shock because it'd be a huge increase.

1051
01:23:20,367 --> 01:23:32,956
[SPEAKER_20]: Furthermore, in the fiscal year 22 budget, I saw a lot of capital items being submitted to the water and sewer budget, which I took out, and that would actually need to be funded through retained earnings.

1052
01:23:33,757 --> 01:23:38,720
[SPEAKER_20]: So I would not suggest dipping any further into retained earnings.

1053
01:23:40,942 --> 01:23:49,368
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, so if I could, Alicia, what do we anticipate every year of additional funds to retained earnings?

1054
01:23:50,497 --> 01:23:51,237
[SPEAKER_20]: That's hard to say.

1055
01:23:51,337 --> 01:23:57,180
[SPEAKER_20]: So retained earnings are one-time revenue, so we could deplete the whole thing and not have any retained earnings at all.

1056
01:23:57,240 --> 01:24:01,441
[SPEAKER_20]: What retained earnings is, is we actually had more money.

1057
01:24:01,481 --> 01:24:03,442
[SPEAKER_20]: We didn't spend as much as we thought we were going to spend.

1058
01:24:03,462 --> 01:24:04,282
[SPEAKER_20]: We had some savings.

1059
01:24:04,363 --> 01:24:10,505
[SPEAKER_20]: So initially, when I put these emergency spending freezes in place,

1060
01:24:11,558 --> 01:24:27,546
[SPEAKER_20]: Usually they're slowing down on their spending, which causes a little bit of savings at the end, but going forward, once the economy recovers and COVID is gone, there's no guarantee you're going to have retained earnings each year.

1061
01:24:29,307 --> 01:24:35,811
[SPEAKER_09]: I understand that, but this account grows every year, sitting on the council.

1062
01:24:36,431 --> 01:24:38,892
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm trying to anticipate once we use 500,000,

1063
01:24:40,958 --> 01:24:42,980
[SPEAKER_09]: It's currently $6,059,000.

1064
01:24:43,400 --> 01:24:46,142
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll leave us with about $5,500,000.

1065
01:24:46,603 --> 01:24:50,246
[SPEAKER_09]: What do we anticipate this time next year having in the account?

1066
01:24:50,806 --> 01:24:55,950
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sure it's- That'll be estimated at the end of the year to be complete to the chair.

1067
01:24:56,170 --> 01:24:57,851
[SPEAKER_20]: That would be estimated at the end of the year.

1068
01:24:57,871 --> 01:25:07,579
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd have to look to come up with an estimate of what would be left, but knowing that there are huge capital costs that are coming through there is gonna take that number down.

1069
01:25:07,779 --> 01:25:08,460
[SPEAKER_20]: So even if,

1070
01:25:09,120 --> 01:25:16,504
[SPEAKER_20]: we have money, as you said, at the end of the year, a lot of that is going to be earmarked for projects that I took out of the budget so that the rate payers didn't have any great increase.

1071
01:25:17,985 --> 01:25:20,987
[SPEAKER_20]: Because it's really only supposed to be used for one-time costs.

1072
01:25:21,828 --> 01:25:31,333
[SPEAKER_20]: It's usually not used for subsidizing the rate, but due to COVID-19, that's why we're using it to subsidize the budget, to ease the pain off of people during the recession.

1073
01:25:31,934 --> 01:25:34,675
[SPEAKER_20]: But it really should be used for one-time costs, such as capital costs.

1074
01:25:35,596 --> 01:25:35,816
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1075
01:25:36,156 --> 01:25:37,437
[SPEAKER_09]: And I can appreciate that.

1076
01:25:38,513 --> 01:25:44,216
[SPEAKER_09]: I can tell you firsthand that this amount of money is not gonna ease much off the rate payers.

1077
01:25:44,816 --> 01:25:52,519
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a good symbolic gesture, but it's really not gonna ease the feelings of the rate payers in this community.

1078
01:25:52,979 --> 01:26:06,405
[SPEAKER_09]: And if anything, the 6 million that's out there, as you stated, is an overreach of the city charging too much for water and sewer, and that's how we end up with the retained earnings.

1079
01:26:08,500 --> 01:26:21,042
[SPEAKER_09]: But putting that aside, there's been some discussion recently, and I brought up the issue within the last couple of weeks about our water meters.

1080
01:26:21,843 --> 01:26:30,164
[SPEAKER_09]: And this discussion has been that we're close to the life expectancy of the water meters that were installed some years back.

1081
01:26:30,864 --> 01:26:36,185
[SPEAKER_09]: And is the administration, if you can't answer this, I understand, it's not under your jurisdiction,

1082
01:26:36,612 --> 01:26:42,136
[SPEAKER_09]: Is the administration currently looking at water meters within the community for replacement?

1083
01:26:43,177 --> 01:26:44,037
[SPEAKER_20]: Through the chair, yes.

1084
01:26:44,678 --> 01:26:47,740
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, the current administration is looking at water meters.

1085
01:26:49,041 --> 01:27:00,289
[SPEAKER_09]: So is there potential that the retained earnings, which could be a one-time cost for infrastructure, be looked at for the replacement of water meters?

1086
01:27:01,310 --> 01:27:03,151
[SPEAKER_20]: If requested by the DPW,

1087
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:06,831
[SPEAKER_20]: They can request that of the mayor.

1088
01:27:06,871 --> 01:27:10,173
[SPEAKER_20]: They can request to use retained earnings for replacement of water meters.

1089
01:27:10,193 --> 01:27:10,893
[SPEAKER_20]: They absolutely can.

1090
01:27:12,534 --> 01:27:14,435
[SPEAKER_09]: DPW or the water and sewer commissions?

1091
01:27:15,636 --> 01:27:21,399
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm talking about the DPW because the water and sewer is under the DPW umbrella.

1092
01:27:22,840 --> 01:27:26,002
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, but who would ultimately approve the new meters?

1093
01:27:26,022 --> 01:27:27,543
[SPEAKER_09]: Would it be the water and sewer commissioners?

1094
01:27:28,964 --> 01:27:34,047
[SPEAKER_20]: No, it would be the mayor because the mayor would have to fund it.

1095
01:27:36,566 --> 01:27:39,748
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, so the recommendation doesn't come from the Water and Sewer Commissioners?

1096
01:27:40,509 --> 01:27:40,749
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

1097
01:27:41,169 --> 01:27:56,619
[SPEAKER_20]: What the Water and Sewer Commissioners do each year when we're meeting is they're discussing policy, they get the budget number from me, they get the debt service number from me, they get the indirect costs, which is the people's health insurance, dental insurance, pension costs.

1098
01:27:57,383 --> 01:28:01,065
[SPEAKER_20]: They get that and then they vote a rate to fund those operations.

1099
01:28:01,145 --> 01:28:07,429
[SPEAKER_20]: And obviously the biggest cost of all being the MWRA assessment, this year alone went up $835,471.

1100
01:28:08,070 --> 01:28:12,653
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what they're voting.

1101
01:28:13,653 --> 01:28:14,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

1102
01:28:14,474 --> 01:28:23,760
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's, you know, when I was on the council, when we last replaced the water meters and the water and sewer commissioners were an integral part,

1103
01:28:24,287 --> 01:28:28,772
[SPEAKER_09]: of the replacement, along with the DPW, you are correct.

1104
01:28:29,653 --> 01:28:45,469
[SPEAKER_09]: So my, you know, one concern is that if we don't request more money for retained earnings to offset the increase, we're at 3% now with the 500,000, then if we are gonna use this for new water meters,

1105
01:28:46,030 --> 01:28:52,795
[SPEAKER_09]: which I think we all can remember the time and Councilor Penta brought it up a couple of weeks ago about the number of abatements.

1106
01:28:52,875 --> 01:29:04,164
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe it was over 700 abatements given in one calendar year because we were estimating over half of our water and sewer bills because of malfunctioning meters.

1107
01:29:04,484 --> 01:29:07,406
[SPEAKER_09]: We never want to go back to that time.

1108
01:29:08,107 --> 01:29:14,852
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we can get some type of commitment from the administration that the funds will be taken out of this account

1109
01:29:16,499 --> 01:29:32,346
[SPEAKER_09]: I will not look to further tap this account because I think in general, it's going to ultimately save the rate payers by having an accurate meter and it serves the same purpose.

1110
01:29:32,887 --> 01:29:42,271
[SPEAKER_09]: So at this point, I'm not gonna have an additional dollar amount as long as we know that the money is coming from these particular funds for the new meters.

1111
01:29:42,751 --> 01:29:43,832
[SPEAKER_09]: And I guess at some point,

1112
01:29:44,416 --> 01:29:46,117
[SPEAKER_09]: the mayor is going to ask for an appropriation.

1113
01:29:46,197 --> 01:29:52,259
[SPEAKER_09]: So it will require a council approval, but I just want to go on record that that's what I would be supporting at this point.

1114
01:29:52,940 --> 01:29:53,300
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1115
01:29:55,100 --> 01:29:55,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1116
01:29:55,861 --> 01:29:56,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further questions?

1117
01:29:56,761 --> 01:29:57,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Knight.

1118
01:29:57,882 --> 01:30:10,327
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, Mr. President, you know, Councilor Marks started talking about the capital improvement plan earlier and being a big government nerd got me all excited and got me reading this capital improvement plan over the weekend.

1119
01:30:10,907 --> 01:30:13,388
[SPEAKER_07]: And when you look at the capital improvement plan, what you'll see in it,

1120
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:21,084
[SPEAKER_07]: is that over the next six years, it's the administration's intention to spend upwards of $18 million on water and sewer infrastructure.

1121
01:30:23,686 --> 01:30:31,331
[SPEAKER_07]: The capital improvement plan also says the investment strategy calls for all water and sewer projects to be funded from enterprise revenues.

1122
01:30:33,732 --> 01:30:37,535
[SPEAKER_07]: And the meters, Mr. President, are not a part of this capital improvement plan.

1123
01:30:38,656 --> 01:30:40,397
[SPEAKER_07]: So let's just get that out there right now.

1124
01:30:41,317 --> 01:30:44,738
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the meat is not part of the strategy or the school improvement plan that they're discussing.

1125
01:30:44,758 --> 01:30:52,959
[SPEAKER_07]: So the administration may be looking at it, but it seems to me that that started probably about 14 days ago when the speaker was up at the podium.

1126
01:30:53,079 --> 01:30:59,561
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I certainly think it's important that we provide rate relief to the tax, to the rate payers, and I'll be supporting this paper this evening.

1127
01:31:00,461 --> 01:31:04,322
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, ultimately what we're doing is really developing this structural deficit.

1128
01:31:04,482 --> 01:31:09,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Every year we're going to have to appropriate these funds, because if we don't, then as the finance director said,

1129
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:14,502
[SPEAKER_07]: the rate payers are gonna see sticker shots because their rate's gonna go up, you know, somewhere around 5%.

1130
01:31:14,562 --> 01:31:17,323
[SPEAKER_07]: So with that being said, I will put the paper this evening.

1131
01:31:17,763 --> 01:31:21,945
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I would like to point out the inconsistencies between the capital improvement plan and what's going on.

1132
01:31:21,965 --> 01:31:24,345
[SPEAKER_07]: Any further questions?

1133
01:31:24,365 --> 01:31:28,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, on the motion.

1134
01:31:31,448 --> 01:31:32,048

[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor, former Councilor Patricia Dougherty, 235 Winter Street, number 440 Method Mass.

1197
01:33:23,651 --> 01:33:32,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Former Councilor Patricia Dougherty would like to discuss with the residents of Method, Method's ability to exercise the first amendment way of free speech.

1198
01:33:32,897 --> 01:33:33,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Former Councilor Dougherty.

1199
01:33:35,177 --> 01:33:35,437
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

1200
01:33:35,457 --> 01:33:37,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address of the record, please.

1201
01:33:37,077 --> 01:33:40,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Patricia Brady Daugherty, 235 Winthrop Street.

1202
01:33:40,778 --> 01:33:41,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1203
01:33:41,318 --> 01:33:45,899
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilors, thank you for the opportunity to speak tonight.

1204
01:33:47,479 --> 01:33:51,560
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to stay in my timeframe, I'm going to read my statement, so please bear with me.

1205
01:33:52,801 --> 01:34:04,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Last Tuesday, I placed this on the agenda to speak about a statement made by a Human Rights Commission member in an April meeting who was critical of the fact that the mayor was on a Zoom meeting

1206
01:34:05,170 --> 01:34:06,250
[SPEAKER_02]: alongside the flag.

1207
01:34:08,051 --> 01:34:21,414
[SPEAKER_02]: The statement made was, and I quote, I noticed that the male was sitting next to the flag and the flag means so many things to so many people, but to black and brown people, it means rape and pillaging.

1208
01:34:23,455 --> 01:34:27,676
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to repeat that statement so that you understand that you heard it correctly.

1209
01:34:30,277 --> 01:34:35,360
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that the mayor was sitting next to the flag and the flag means so many things to so many people.

1210
01:34:35,380 --> 01:34:35,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Ms.

1211
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:40,324
[SPEAKER_07]: Brady, if I may interrupt you for just a moment and ask that you put your mask on due to the guidelines that the board of health has put out.

1212
01:34:40,424 --> 01:34:46,408
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to create- I'll put it under my chin, but I am going to follow the Councilors and not wear my mask over my face when speaking.

1213
01:34:46,828 --> 01:34:48,369
[SPEAKER_02]: They're separated by- Ms.

1214
01:34:49,370 --> 01:34:51,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Brady, I'm not the one that creates the guideline.

1215
01:34:51,551 --> 01:34:52,832
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to ask you to comply with it.

1216
01:34:53,032 --> 01:34:53,793
[SPEAKER_07]: Can you please comply with it?

1217
01:34:53,813 --> 01:34:55,434
[SPEAKER_02]: You can ask me, but I don't want to do it.

1218
01:34:55,574 --> 01:34:59,016
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll cause me to have problems speaking.

1219
01:34:59,848 --> 01:35:01,569
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm asking you to comply with the guideline, Ms.

1220
01:35:01,589 --> 01:35:01,889
[SPEAKER_07]: Brady.

1221
01:35:01,929 --> 01:35:03,630
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to have to go down this road.

1222
01:35:03,670 --> 01:35:05,071
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give you your turn to speak.

1223
01:35:05,271 --> 01:35:07,093
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm asking you to please put your mask on.

1224
01:35:08,373 --> 01:35:09,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Only as a favor to you, Adam.

1225
01:35:09,794 --> 01:35:10,495
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.

1226
01:35:18,259 --> 01:35:22,882
[SPEAKER_02]: It appears that no one at the Human Rights Commission meeting spoke up to defend the flag.

1227
01:35:23,883 --> 01:35:29,006
[SPEAKER_02]: However, one person did step forward on social media, but I will speak to that in a minute.

1228
01:35:31,355 --> 01:35:33,335
[SPEAKER_02]: There are thousands of veterans in this community.

1229
01:35:34,055 --> 01:35:41,557
[SPEAKER_02]: There are hundreds of people in this community who have shed their blood and died on the battlefield in defense of their flag, our flag.

1230
01:35:42,617 --> 01:35:48,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Every person who's into the military takes this oath, takes their oath in front of the American flag.

1231
01:35:49,878 --> 01:35:55,639
[SPEAKER_02]: Every morning, the army awakes to the rising of the flag, the raising of the flag with revelry.

1232
01:35:56,359 --> 01:36:00,660
[SPEAKER_02]: And when the day is done, the flag is lowered when the evening gun is fired in a solemn ceremony.

1233
01:36:02,836 --> 01:36:05,997
[SPEAKER_02]: An American soldier wears the flag on his sleeve.

1234
01:36:06,658 --> 01:36:10,319
[SPEAKER_02]: If a soldier dies in combat, he comes home in a flag-draped coffin.

1235
01:36:11,219 --> 01:36:20,583
[SPEAKER_02]: When a soldier is buried with full military honors, the last thing that happens is that the flag is folded, presented to family with the words, by a grateful nation.

1236
01:36:23,564 --> 01:36:30,047
[SPEAKER_02]: A soldier does not allow the flag to touch the ground, and when the flag is worn out, it's burned and its ashes buried.

1237
01:36:32,415 --> 01:36:43,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Between World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War, Gulf War, Afghanistan, and Iraq, almost a million and a half Americans lost their lives overseas.

1238
01:36:44,661 --> 01:36:48,922
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not speak German or Japanese as a captive people because of these veterans.

1239
01:36:50,943 --> 01:36:54,525
[SPEAKER_02]: We decorate our veterans' graves on Oak Grove with flags for Memorial Day.

1240
01:36:55,345 --> 01:37:08,647
[SPEAKER_02]: This weekend and next, veterans will place 8,700 flags on graves for the upcoming Memorial Day holiday on May 31st, when the city will honor the men and women who died while serving their country.

1241
01:37:11,448 --> 01:37:18,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Veterans look to this flag as a symbol of this great country, the lives lost and the freedoms won.

1242
01:37:18,709 --> 01:37:22,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Veterans are bonded to the flag as are most Americans.

1243
01:37:25,230 --> 01:37:36,016
[SPEAKER_02]: We say the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag as school children, the city council and the school committee starts its meetings with the Pledge of Allegiance as do people at baseball games and other sporting events.

1244
01:37:36,576 --> 01:37:38,577
[SPEAKER_02]: It is who we are as an American people.

1245
01:37:40,718 --> 01:37:53,245
[SPEAKER_02]: If this statement regarding the flag were made in a private conversation, then I would fully support the commission members right to say this no matter how offensive it is to veterans and other citizens.

1246
01:37:54,272 --> 01:38:00,517
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this person was serving in an official capacity as representative of the city of Medford when she made the statement.

1247
01:38:02,839 --> 01:38:10,665
[SPEAKER_02]: All people who are elected officials and appointed members of boards and commission in this city take an oath to uphold the constitution.

1248
01:38:11,906 --> 01:38:17,450
[SPEAKER_02]: The constitution is the basis of the country and the flag is a symbol of our country here and around the world.

1249
01:38:20,873 --> 01:38:23,575
[SPEAKER_02]: The statement regarding the flag

1250
01:38:24,724 --> 01:38:34,970
[SPEAKER_02]: made by the Human Rights Commission member calls into question her ability to faithfully execute her duties impartially as an appointed member in this city.

1251
01:38:37,351 --> 01:38:47,336
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, would she treat a veteran fairly or unfairly if he or she appeared before the commission wearing a hat with a flag on it?

1252
01:38:49,657 --> 01:38:50,778
[SPEAKER_02]: And speaking of veterans,

1253
01:38:51,279 --> 01:39:02,984
[SPEAKER_02]: This week, veteran organizations in the city learned that the city is seeking a waiver from the state to override the law requiring veterans preference when hiring new police officers.

1254
01:39:04,485 --> 01:39:10,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, another insult to veterans is that veterans do not matter in this city any longer.

1255
01:39:10,687 --> 01:39:19,911
[SPEAKER_02]: As mentioned earlier, one Medford resident expressed his anger on social media

1256
01:39:21,074 --> 01:39:24,817
[SPEAKER_02]: about the statement made by the Human Rights Commission member disrespecting the flag.

1257
01:39:25,517 --> 01:39:27,418
[SPEAKER_02]: He titled his post defending the flag.

1258
01:39:28,539 --> 01:39:37,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I do not condone some of the language he chose to use in his post, nevertheless, he has a constitutional right of free speech as we all do express his opinion.

1259
01:39:39,486 --> 01:39:49,313
[SPEAKER_02]: However, in response to this post, the Human Rights Commission called an emergency meeting, essentially to attack this resident expressing an opinion they do not like.

1260
01:39:50,811 --> 01:40:13,159
[SPEAKER_02]: During this emergency Zoom meeting, the Human Rights Commission members, including the mayor's liaison, the director of diversity, two city Councilors, a school committee member, including members of the public, proceeded to vilify this resident, simply because he had expressed his criticism of the statement attacking the flag.

1261
01:40:14,220 --> 01:40:19,662
[SPEAKER_02]: They called him a racist, a misogynist, and a deviant, all under the pretext

1262
01:40:20,095 --> 01:40:21,016
[SPEAKER_02]: of a public meeting.

1263
01:40:23,658 --> 01:40:35,047
[SPEAKER_02]: One woman even asked the chief of police who was present if they could visit this person, if they could investigate him, if they could intimidate him.

1264
01:40:37,168 --> 01:40:43,513
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like someone advocating KGB action, like in a police state.

1265
01:40:44,754 --> 01:40:47,957
[SPEAKER_02]: And not one person present objected to that statement.

1266
01:40:50,052 --> 01:40:58,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, all of this vitriol is directed an individual simply because he exercised his constitutional right to free speech.

1267
01:41:01,379 --> 01:41:19,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it not height of hypocrisy for commission members, elected officials and others to condemn this resident for exercising his first amendment right to free speech while at the same time claiming the commission member, the original statement to spreading the flag was a proper exercise of free speech?

1268
01:41:20,920 --> 01:41:21,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1269
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:23,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1270
01:41:25,381 --> 01:41:28,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. President.

1271
01:41:28,982 --> 01:41:29,602
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1272
01:41:29,622 --> 01:41:35,243
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to say I was present at that meeting and I actually specifically did say I did object to that.

1273
01:41:35,383 --> 01:41:38,464
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think there's a little bit of selective hearing here.

1274
01:41:39,744 --> 01:41:40,384
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all I'll say.

1275
01:41:41,404 --> 01:41:43,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to the chair to Council of bears.

1276
01:41:46,570 --> 01:41:51,495
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be a lot nicer if you could come see me eye to eye like the other Councilors are here.

1277
01:41:51,515 --> 01:41:55,118
[SPEAKER_18]: It'd be a lot nicer if you would wear a mask as we've asked you to do.

1278
01:41:55,178 --> 01:41:55,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1279
01:41:55,839 --> 01:42:04,968
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to let you know that I watched that meeting, all 143 minutes of it, painfully watching it three times.

1280
01:42:05,809 --> 01:42:07,110
[SPEAKER_02]: I have many, many notes.

1281
01:42:07,991 --> 01:42:16,154
[SPEAKER_02]: What you did say was, you did say he has a right to say it, but you went on to vilify him and you went on to vilify white males in the community.

1282
01:42:16,194 --> 01:42:19,195
[SPEAKER_02]: And you said it was a white male problem.

1283
01:42:19,415 --> 01:42:21,596
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a cultural problem in this city.

1284
01:42:22,576 --> 01:42:25,257
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't have those in front of me, because I got to stay within my 10 minutes.

1285
01:42:26,338 --> 01:42:26,718
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1286
01:42:27,218 --> 01:42:27,998
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Councilor.

1287
01:42:28,479 --> 01:42:29,459
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, if I may.

1288
01:42:30,739 --> 01:42:31,180
[SPEAKER_18]: Councilor Betz.

1289
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:37,262
[SPEAKER_18]: I said specifically, you can quote me, we will not police or surveil our way out of this.

1290
01:42:37,826 --> 01:42:43,014
[SPEAKER_18]: So I was specifically saying we should not advocate any use of police or surveillance around this topic.

1291
01:42:43,434 --> 01:42:46,258
[SPEAKER_18]: And freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequences.

1292
01:42:46,939 --> 01:42:50,184
[SPEAKER_18]: He said something, people objected to it, they made their point.

1293
01:42:50,445 --> 01:42:51,326
[SPEAKER_18]: That's how this works.

1294
01:42:51,686 --> 01:42:52,047
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1295
01:42:52,889 --> 01:43:00,135
[SPEAKER_02]: The chair councilor bears more than 350 Tuesday nights a chair to countless committee of the whole meetings.

1296
01:43:00,535 --> 01:43:01,956
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how the process works.

1297
01:43:01,996 --> 01:43:03,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also a member of the bar.

1298
01:43:03,798 --> 01:43:04,598
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard what you said.

1299
01:43:04,959 --> 01:43:10,423
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't say a word when that woman on Grove Street said what she said about police tactics and intimidating him.

1300
01:43:10,883 --> 01:43:18,730
[SPEAKER_02]: You did say something earlier and I said what you said, but you also said it was a white male problem and it was a cultural problem in this city.

1301
01:43:20,391 --> 01:43:21,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1302
01:43:22,294 --> 01:43:22,994
[SPEAKER_07]: Vice President Knight.

1303
01:43:23,354 --> 01:43:24,955
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we need to get into what he said.

1304
01:43:24,995 --> 01:43:31,057
[SPEAKER_07]: She said at this point, the speaker was able to articulate her thoughts and the gentleman was able to rebut.

1305
01:43:31,137 --> 01:43:32,597
[SPEAKER_07]: It may be appropriate for us to move on.

1306
01:43:32,898 --> 01:43:33,198
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1307
01:43:33,358 --> 01:43:34,098
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Doherty.

1308
01:43:34,358 --> 01:43:34,698
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1309
01:43:34,718 --> 01:43:35,118
Thank you.

1310
01:43:38,019 --> 01:43:38,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

1311
01:43:38,419 --> 01:43:39,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address of the record, please.

1312
01:43:39,540 --> 01:43:40,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Good evening.

1313
01:43:40,100 --> 01:43:42,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Anita D'Antonio, 14 Yale Street.

1314
01:43:43,641 --> 01:43:47,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Very interesting issue, free speech and the First Amendment.

1315
01:43:48,082 --> 01:43:49,803
[SPEAKER_14]: And very pertinent to this city.

1316
01:43:51,455 --> 01:43:52,196
[SPEAKER_14]: in this era.

1317
01:43:54,397 --> 01:43:59,780
[SPEAKER_14]: I am a lifelong resident of Medford, and that brings me to a point.

1318
01:44:00,621 --> 01:44:20,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Recently, there was a resolution brought forward by a public official, I believe on the school committee, requesting that public participation or public speaking participants not mention that they were lifelong residents.

1319
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:26,584
[SPEAKER_14]: or whatever years they spent in Medford.

1320
01:44:28,885 --> 01:44:30,827
[SPEAKER_14]: We're talking about free speech here.

1321
01:44:31,127 --> 01:44:37,792
[SPEAKER_14]: If that isn't an abrogation of free speech, I don't know what is, coming from a public official.

1322
01:44:38,512 --> 01:44:41,174
[SPEAKER_14]: And I would like to add onto what Ms.

1323
01:44:42,135 --> 01:44:43,216
[SPEAKER_14]: Brady-Doherty said.

1324
01:44:44,457 --> 01:44:50,081
[SPEAKER_14]: This Human Rights Commission, that's under the rubric of a public commission.

1325
01:44:50,930 --> 01:45:01,777
[SPEAKER_14]: you're making statements from that podium, from that chair, and they're taken with some authority.

1326
01:45:02,697 --> 01:45:19,608
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would say everyone has the right to free speech, but you do have to be careful in terms of whether you are libeling people, slandering them, which brings me to another point, something that happened in Medford,

1327
01:45:20,153 --> 01:45:28,460
[SPEAKER_14]: I found very disturbing, but I heard very little about this in terms of condemnation from any public officials.

1328
01:45:29,461 --> 01:45:30,842
[SPEAKER_14]: I spoke with the mayor about it.

1329
01:45:32,964 --> 01:45:37,428
[SPEAKER_14]: I really didn't get much of an effective, efficacious response.

1330
01:45:38,269 --> 01:45:44,454
[SPEAKER_14]: It had to do with the rally, the infamous rally that took place in support of the Medford Police Department.

1331
01:45:46,556 --> 01:45:47,777
[SPEAKER_14]: What ensued from that

1332
01:45:49,577 --> 01:45:58,060
[SPEAKER_14]: because people organized that, supported it, was a list, Racists of Medford.

1333
01:45:59,321 --> 01:46:09,625
[SPEAKER_14]: The people who supported that rally were targeted, put on a blog, on the internet, for all to see, and it was there for months.

1334
01:46:10,465 --> 01:46:12,626
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just been recently taken down.

1335
01:46:13,406 --> 01:46:17,808
[SPEAKER_14]: I was told that, well, we can't trace who the author of that is.

1336
01:46:18,713 --> 01:46:21,754
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't know how to get it off of the internet, on and on.

1337
01:46:23,015 --> 01:46:31,798
[SPEAKER_14]: I did not hear a condemnation of that blog from any public official with any robustness behind it.

1338
01:46:32,379 --> 01:46:41,683
[SPEAKER_14]: The way the mayor and the police chief condemned and castigated the organizers and the rally in support of the Medford police.

1339
01:46:41,943 --> 01:46:45,024
[SPEAKER_14]: Whether I agree with it or not, that's not the point.

1340
01:46:46,108 --> 01:46:52,170
[SPEAKER_14]: What came out of that was someone who decided she didn't like those people who organized that rally.

1341
01:46:52,710 --> 01:46:56,571
[SPEAKER_14]: And she was gonna just show everyone what racist they were.

1342
01:46:57,211 --> 01:46:58,732
[SPEAKER_14]: These are private citizens.

1343
01:46:59,152 --> 01:47:00,452
[SPEAKER_14]: They are business owners.

1344
01:47:00,932 --> 01:47:02,433
[SPEAKER_14]: They are residents of this city.

1345
01:47:02,833 --> 01:47:03,913
[SPEAKER_14]: They are our neighbors.

1346
01:47:04,693 --> 01:47:05,394
[SPEAKER_14]: What happened?

1347
01:47:05,794 --> 01:47:06,694
[SPEAKER_14]: That's libel.

1348
01:47:06,874 --> 01:47:08,975
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not free speech.

1349
01:47:09,155 --> 01:47:11,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Libel is not covered by free speech.

1350
01:47:12,396 --> 01:47:13,816
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the things I'm hearing

1351
01:47:14,502 --> 01:47:20,246
[SPEAKER_14]: from public officials, whether they be on Twitter or Facebook, and that's part of the problem.

1352
01:47:21,466 --> 01:47:34,675
[SPEAKER_14]: We have supplanted face-to-face speech, coming to meetings like this and having vibrant disagreements and agreements and discussion with Facebook and Twitter.

1353
01:47:35,816 --> 01:47:42,280
[SPEAKER_14]: I stand here with trepidation anytime I come to this podium because I'm speaking

1354
01:47:42,825 --> 01:47:45,346
[SPEAKER_14]: to the public, it's a public speaking exercise.

1355
01:47:46,587 --> 01:47:51,669
[SPEAKER_14]: There's even more anxiety now because I have the fear I may be doxxed.

1356
01:47:52,349 --> 01:47:59,993
[SPEAKER_14]: I may find my picture, my address, my name on Facebook with any stereotype, fill in the blank.

1357
01:48:00,433 --> 01:48:04,795
[SPEAKER_14]: For crying out loud, I may even be labeled a Democrat or a Republican.

1358
01:48:05,995 --> 01:48:07,416
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a little humor, sorry.

1359
01:48:08,775 --> 01:48:13,736
[SPEAKER_14]: But you know, the atmosphere in this city is toxic.

1360
01:48:14,557 --> 01:48:23,119
[SPEAKER_14]: We can discuss the budget, we can discuss diversity, all of that, but the atmosphere is toxic here.

1361
01:48:23,979 --> 01:48:27,500
[SPEAKER_14]: Just go on Facebook, the Medford Mass Facebook.

1362
01:48:27,600 --> 01:48:30,181
[SPEAKER_14]: Take a look at any of the statements that are made.

1363
01:48:30,721 --> 01:48:37,563
[SPEAKER_14]: I have read stereotypical statements that are a disgrace coming from people who espouse their tolerance.

1364
01:48:39,414 --> 01:48:43,497
[SPEAKER_14]: If you've lived here a certain amount of years, you fit into a certain pigeonhole.

1365
01:48:45,098 --> 01:48:48,241
[SPEAKER_14]: It is, if you're of a certain ethnicity, you fit into another one.

1366
01:48:49,742 --> 01:48:51,304
[SPEAKER_14]: And nobody is condemning this.

1367
01:48:51,404 --> 01:48:52,425
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody is speaking out.

1368
01:48:52,465 --> 01:48:53,526
[SPEAKER_14]: We want diversity.

1369
01:48:54,947 --> 01:48:59,511
[SPEAKER_14]: How about some consideration for decency?

1370
01:49:00,292 --> 01:49:02,173
[SPEAKER_14]: Use all the free speech you want.

1371
01:49:02,233 --> 01:49:03,134
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's a quote.

1372
01:49:03,777 --> 01:49:10,278
[SPEAKER_14]: If you're really in favor of free speech, then you're in favor of freedom of speech for precisely the views you despise.

1373
01:49:10,978 --> 01:49:13,239
[SPEAKER_14]: Otherwise, you're not in favor of free speech.

1374
01:49:13,899 --> 01:49:22,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Noam Chomsky said that, someone I vehemently disagree with ideologically, but he makes exact sense.

1375
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:23,640
[SPEAKER_14]: That's exactly correct.

1376
01:49:24,240 --> 01:49:26,461
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what makes all of this great.

1377
01:49:27,361 --> 01:49:33,342
[SPEAKER_14]: I have watched city council meetings where we have had such contentious meetings over issues.

1378
01:49:34,091 --> 01:49:54,848
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, insults were hurled, accusations back and forth, never to go home and find on some public forum that any one of the Councilors or the citizens who came up were condemned, stereotyped, called bigot, racist, xenophobe, on and on and on.

1379
01:49:54,928 --> 01:49:56,589
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just the order of the day.

1380
01:49:57,269 --> 01:50:01,613
[SPEAKER_14]: If you do not agree with a particular thought or agenda,

1381
01:50:02,788 --> 01:50:08,372
[SPEAKER_14]: or you have a different opinion, you're presumed guilty of something.

1382
01:50:09,853 --> 01:50:10,914
[SPEAKER_14]: And it goes from there.

1383
01:50:12,155 --> 01:50:22,762
[SPEAKER_14]: So between those two incidents, I could point to with regard to the racist of Medford, imagine any one of you being on that blog, wouldn't that be nice?

1384
01:50:23,725 --> 01:50:26,567
[SPEAKER_14]: That's probably the worst thing you could call someone.

1385
01:50:26,847 --> 01:50:28,328
[SPEAKER_14]: And that stayed up there.

1386
01:50:28,428 --> 01:50:30,929
[SPEAKER_14]: All you had to do was put in racist of Medford.

1387
01:50:31,369 --> 01:50:33,611
[SPEAKER_14]: And there it was for all the world to see.

1388
01:50:34,651 --> 01:50:36,452
[SPEAKER_14]: Not a peep from anyone.

1389
01:50:37,193 --> 01:50:39,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Not a peep from the chief of police.

1390
01:50:39,874 --> 01:50:49,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe you could not find out who had that blog, but your Donnell could have condemned it robustly and said, we don't want that in this city.

1391
01:50:50,320 --> 01:50:50,760
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing.

1392
01:50:51,141 --> 01:50:51,961
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard nothing.

1393
01:50:52,787 --> 01:50:56,970
[SPEAKER_14]: The same thing now with what I shouldn't say I'm a lifelong resident.

1394
01:50:57,110 --> 01:51:01,053
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't care if you moved here yesterday, you're welcomed in this city.

1395
01:51:01,774 --> 01:51:09,700
[SPEAKER_14]: I should be accepted in this city as a lifelong resident and not be put in a pigeon hole because I choose to speak freely.

1396
01:51:11,301 --> 01:51:15,604
[SPEAKER_14]: We are chilling free speech and it's right here in our own city.

1397
01:51:16,305 --> 01:51:20,668
[SPEAKER_14]: We haven't crossed the Rubicon yet, but we're perilously close.

1398
01:51:21,308 --> 01:51:24,009
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm afraid it's only going to get worse.

1399
01:51:24,729 --> 01:51:26,309
[SPEAKER_14]: It doesn't look good right now.

1400
01:51:26,769 --> 01:51:32,431
[SPEAKER_14]: And we don't have the courage of our convictions to stand up and oppose things when they are wrong.

1401
01:51:32,991 --> 01:51:38,032
[SPEAKER_14]: Not when they're politically correct to oppose, but when they are wrong.

1402
01:51:38,472 --> 01:51:39,593
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I ask.

1403
01:51:40,433 --> 01:51:45,894
[SPEAKER_14]: And then the last thing I'll say is, quoting Winston Churchill, a paraphrase.

1404
01:51:46,974 --> 01:51:48,875
[SPEAKER_14]: Some people's idea of free speech

1405
01:51:49,740 --> 01:51:56,083
[SPEAKER_14]: is that they are free to say what they like, but if anyone says anything back, that is an outrage.

1406
01:51:57,103 --> 01:51:58,864
[SPEAKER_14]: We should not embrace that.

1407
01:51:59,484 --> 01:52:03,626
[SPEAKER_14]: We should have good, free, flowing conversation.

1408
01:52:03,886 --> 01:52:15,411
[SPEAKER_14]: And when I leave this podium, I should feel as though I've made my opinion known, and I don't wanna feel as though I've been stereotyped, labeled, ostracized, castigated.

1409
01:52:15,932 --> 01:52:18,793
[SPEAKER_14]: Should not be, but that's what's happening in this city.

1410
01:52:19,338 --> 01:52:20,598
[SPEAKER_14]: far too often.

1411
01:52:20,939 --> 01:52:22,179
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for listening to me.

1412
01:52:22,619 --> 01:52:23,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. D'Antonio.

1413
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:28,141
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening.

1414
01:52:28,181 --> 01:52:29,281
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address of the record, please.

1415
01:52:30,182 --> 01:52:32,462
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road.

1416
01:52:32,482 --> 01:52:35,403
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm at the NASS, former member of the Sawyer-Gasparti.

1417
01:52:35,643 --> 01:52:46,327
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to, at the outset, I'd like to thank former Councilor Doherty for coming forward because her points of vote are very cogent because Memorial Day is right around the corner.

1418
01:52:47,253 --> 01:52:53,876
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably the most sacred of all our veterans holidays during the course of the year.

1419
01:52:54,916 --> 01:53:06,122
[SPEAKER_05]: And for this city to go forward and look for an exemption to eliminate veterans in a police exam preference says an awful lot of things as it relates to where are we going?

1420
01:53:07,602 --> 01:53:11,464
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, where are we going as a community and as elected officials?

1421
01:53:11,984 --> 01:53:13,465
[SPEAKER_05]: You know the real sad part about this?

1422
01:53:14,415 --> 01:53:17,797
[SPEAKER_05]: This is gonna be the 30th year in Washington, D.C.

1423
01:53:18,697 --> 01:53:21,459
[SPEAKER_05]: that the veterans have had their annual motorcycle parade.

1424
01:53:21,939 --> 01:53:24,520
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's the first time that it's being canceled.

1425
01:53:25,321 --> 01:53:28,202
[SPEAKER_05]: It's being canceled because allegedly of COVID.

1426
01:53:28,822 --> 01:53:42,029
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the same day, BLM is having their parade and cannabis is having their event on the same day, same times as the schedule for the AMVETS 30th anniversary motorcycle parade.

1427
01:53:43,795 --> 01:53:50,497
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a little bit of a disconnect here and maybe of a political, where do we go and who is in support of who and whatever it might be.

1428
01:53:50,777 --> 01:53:55,738
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll tell you my experience about my free speech being infringed upon.

1429
01:53:55,758 --> 01:53:58,879
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a group in Method called Method Mass Politics.

1430
01:53:59,479 --> 01:54:01,380
[SPEAKER_05]: The issue was the Christopher Columbus School.

1431
01:54:02,060 --> 01:54:07,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I expressed my opinion on that page, like I've done on many pages here on the city of Medford.

1432
01:54:08,162 --> 01:54:12,903
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been called every conceivable thing that you can think of on that page.

1433
01:54:13,679 --> 01:54:19,342
[SPEAKER_05]: on that group by members in that group and leaving no expert is out.

1434
01:54:19,662 --> 01:54:20,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Just use your imagination.

1435
01:54:22,783 --> 01:54:24,264
[SPEAKER_05]: That's free speech.

1436
01:54:25,644 --> 01:54:33,248
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they want to say it, and if they're not going to be scolded because of being the appropriateness of their language, then so be it.

1437
01:54:34,108 --> 01:54:41,171
[SPEAKER_05]: But I shouldn't be chastised or anyone else be chastised for going on that page or any other page and expressing your opinion.

1438
01:54:41,571 --> 01:54:42,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like Ms.

1439
01:54:42,092 --> 01:54:42,912
[SPEAKER_05]: D'Antonio said,

1440
01:54:43,400 --> 01:54:44,601
[SPEAKER_05]: just like Councilor Doherty said.

1441
01:54:45,182 --> 01:54:50,347
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you are on a board and a commission of this community, common sense dictates.

1442
01:54:51,248 --> 01:54:55,472
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's what you're here for, to listen to both sides of whatever the issue might be.

1443
01:54:56,293 --> 01:54:57,454
[SPEAKER_05]: Common sense dictates.

1444
01:54:57,995 --> 01:55:01,398
[SPEAKER_05]: And unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be working here in the city.

1445
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:04,081
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I resent the most?

1446
01:55:04,804 --> 01:55:16,103
[SPEAKER_05]: I resent the most when people say, I'm white, I was born privileged, and I have a spoon in my mouth, and I can take advantage of anything, or I have taken advantage of it.

1447
01:55:16,123 --> 01:55:18,467
[SPEAKER_05]: When I look at all of you, you're all white, okay?

1448
01:55:19,404 --> 01:55:22,365
[SPEAKER_05]: You work for what you got nothing's been handed down to you.

1449
01:55:23,085 --> 01:55:28,606
[SPEAKER_05]: And I resent the fact that anyone would turn around and tell me that I'm a racist because I'm white.

1450
01:55:28,866 --> 01:55:32,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been privileged because I'm white because nobody knows my life.

1451
01:55:32,507 --> 01:55:35,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody knows my background, how I got to where I am.

1452
01:55:36,228 --> 01:55:43,009
[SPEAKER_05]: And just because I served in government for 39 years, which is the greatest honor I've ever had, outside of being married and having children.

1453
01:55:44,289 --> 01:55:47,590
[SPEAKER_05]: No one can take away that feeling of serving the people

1454
01:55:48,743 --> 01:55:53,247
[SPEAKER_05]: but you serve the people not to denigrate the people, you serve them to build them up.

1455
01:55:54,187 --> 01:56:01,753
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you start to tell little kids today in school, that you've got to be ashamed whether you're white, black, blue or brown, that's wrong.

1456
01:56:02,434 --> 01:56:05,696
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't do that to a little kid in our public school education.

1457
01:56:07,258 --> 01:56:08,679
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna switch gears real quick.

1458
01:56:09,619 --> 01:56:14,223
[SPEAKER_05]: The city of Medford has just been, I've read in patch today, city of Medford is getting $37,500,000.

1459
01:56:17,215 --> 01:56:26,723
[SPEAKER_05]: So if the city of Medford is getting $37,500,000, as Councilor Marks alluded to earlier on this evening, I guess the better question is, you guys have got a budget coming up.

1460
01:56:27,604 --> 01:56:39,214
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you have a budget coming up, why should you discuss a budget when you're anticipating under the American Recovery Act, this $37 million, you're gonna get it all at once, you're gonna get it over a year, how are you going to get it?

1461
01:56:40,111 --> 01:56:45,853
[SPEAKER_05]: You people should have a committee of the whole meeting with the mayor present to tell you how this money is going to be disseminated.

1462
01:56:46,933 --> 01:56:56,135
[SPEAKER_05]: In 2007 and 2009, when this country had its economic problems, the monies that were given out back then couldn't compete against the needs that the communities have.

1463
01:56:56,836 --> 01:56:58,216
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now it's a little bit different.

1464
01:56:59,116 --> 01:57:00,637
[SPEAKER_05]: We're getting $37 million.

1465
01:57:00,717 --> 01:57:02,177
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a tremendous amount of money.

1466
01:57:02,937 --> 01:57:05,338
[SPEAKER_05]: But you got to look at some of the things that can be used for.

1467
01:57:05,859 --> 01:57:16,767
[SPEAKER_05]: And to me, the first question is, it's looming right around the corner from all of you in 2029, you've got an approximately $30 million unfunded pension liability that no one still talks about.

1468
01:57:18,248 --> 01:57:19,169
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's gonna pay for that?

1469
01:57:19,209 --> 01:57:20,010
[SPEAKER_05]: How's it gonna be paid?

1470
01:57:20,330 --> 01:57:23,312
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it gonna be included in this money that you're going to be getting?

1471
01:57:23,733 --> 01:57:25,394
[SPEAKER_05]: These are questions you really need to ask.

1472
01:57:26,054 --> 01:57:32,839
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, it talks about paying premium pay for the people who did work during the COVID-19.

1473
01:57:34,240 --> 01:57:35,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, how are you going to disseminate that?

1474
01:57:35,861 --> 01:57:37,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it going to be first responders?

1475
01:57:37,342 --> 01:57:38,122
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it going to be fire?

1476
01:57:38,142 --> 01:57:38,943
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it going to be police?

1477
01:57:39,583 --> 01:57:40,443
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's it going to be?

1478
01:57:41,284 --> 01:57:44,146
[SPEAKER_05]: I think you really need to sit down and have this conversation.

1479
01:57:44,766 --> 01:57:51,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me ask you, have you people have been notified already that you're getting $37 million or did you just read about it in the paper?

1480
01:57:52,390 --> 01:57:53,251
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, Mr. President?

1481
01:57:53,891 --> 01:57:55,052
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not received it officially.

1482
01:57:55,072 --> 01:58:01,135
[SPEAKER_05]: You have not received it, but it's okay for transparency, for the patch to have it, but the council not to have it.

1483
01:58:02,275 --> 01:58:15,339
[SPEAKER_05]: My suggestion strongly to folks, all of you, whether you're sitting here or the two that are sitting home, that you sit down with the mayor and her staff to discuss what that $37,500,000 is all about.

1484
01:58:15,559 --> 01:58:17,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Point of information, Mr. President?

1485
01:58:17,999 --> 01:58:20,040
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information, Vice President May.

1486
01:58:20,220 --> 01:58:26,182
[SPEAKER_07]: If you refer to our packet that we received this evening, we'll look at paper 21329, and that was a response from the mayor.

1487
01:58:26,662 --> 01:58:29,743
[SPEAKER_07]: We were seeking guidance on how the money would be spent.

1488
01:58:31,658 --> 01:58:37,141
[SPEAKER_07]: says it'll be coming midway pursuant to conversations the administration said with the Division of Local Services.

1489
01:58:38,342 --> 01:58:42,144
[SPEAKER_07]: And the mayor's response goes on to further, this was the mayor's response to a council resolution.

1490
01:58:42,804 --> 01:58:46,947
[SPEAKER_07]: Guidance on how the money AARP will be coming by mid-May says BLS.

1491
01:58:47,147 --> 01:58:52,470
[SPEAKER_07]: So far, we only know we can spend it on lost revenue in water, sewer, and broadband infrastructure.

1492
01:58:52,910 --> 01:58:54,051
[SPEAKER_07]: I will refer this to Ms.

1493
01:58:54,251 --> 01:58:57,012
[SPEAKER_07]: Menley for response to the projected revenues on 42721, signed mail-on.

1494
01:58:59,202 --> 01:59:01,283
[SPEAKER_07]: So this council has taken those steps, Councilor Penta.

1495
01:59:01,303 --> 01:59:02,144
[SPEAKER_07]: We have asked for the meeting.

1496
01:59:02,184 --> 01:59:03,665
[SPEAKER_07]: We have asked where the funds are going to be spent.

1497
01:59:03,985 --> 01:59:08,848
[SPEAKER_07]: The question is whether or not we're going to get the meeting.

1498
01:59:09,268 --> 01:59:10,009
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't see that paper.

1499
01:59:10,169 --> 01:59:16,172
[SPEAKER_05]: Through the chair, Mr. President, it also indicates that you can get premium pay for essential workers and you can offer additional support.

1500
01:59:16,493 --> 01:59:28,400
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can also, the money can also go into the educational park and the educational park for which a lot of these kids have gone through, they have suffered over the past year for emotional disabilities that kids have been able to suffer.

1501
01:59:28,872 --> 01:59:30,012
[SPEAKER_05]: and we won't get it to the people.

1502
01:59:30,032 --> 01:59:32,733
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll just leave it like that.

1503
01:59:32,773 --> 01:59:33,614
[SPEAKER_05]: There is money there.

1504
01:59:33,794 --> 01:59:34,494
[SPEAKER_05]: It's broken down.

1505
01:59:34,534 --> 01:59:35,635
[SPEAKER_05]: There's six categories.

1506
01:59:36,235 --> 01:59:37,395
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not gonna go through all six of them.

1507
01:59:37,435 --> 01:59:42,037
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just saying, thank you, Council Vice President Knight, but I think you really need to sit down.

1508
01:59:42,257 --> 01:59:48,980
[SPEAKER_05]: And before you take one vote on this budget coming up, you should know exactly how and when that money's coming in and what it can be used for.

1509
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:58,103
[SPEAKER_05]: And just as a third point, let's go back to the money that they wanna use to take the $500,000 out of that retained earnings account.

1510
01:59:58,946 --> 02:00:03,375
[SPEAKER_05]: We are well beyond the 10 year, 10 to 12 year minimum.

1511
02:00:03,395 --> 02:00:04,979
[SPEAKER_05]: We're into almost the 15th year.

1512
02:00:05,372 --> 02:00:06,273
[SPEAKER_05]: We have batteries.

1513
02:00:07,033 --> 02:00:09,035
[SPEAKER_05]: Batteries are not calculating properly.

1514
02:00:09,055 --> 02:00:10,937
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's going to reflect on people's bills.

1515
02:00:10,997 --> 02:00:16,021
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's going to be, it was 795 abatements.

1516
02:00:16,381 --> 02:00:17,862
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not what the topic is.

1517
02:00:17,963 --> 02:00:18,463
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no.

1518
02:00:19,003 --> 02:00:20,184
[SPEAKER_05]: No, listen, wait a minute.

1519
02:00:20,204 --> 02:00:21,105
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about money.

1520
02:00:21,165 --> 02:00:22,506
[SPEAKER_05]: We're coming close to our 10 minutes.

1521
02:00:22,586 --> 02:00:23,927
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry, Mr. President.

1522
02:00:23,948 --> 02:00:29,092
[SPEAKER_05]: It does talk about money that can be used for infrastructure and water and sewer and water and sewer.

1523
02:00:29,332 --> 02:00:30,393
[SPEAKER_06]: but we weren't talking about that.

1524
02:00:30,613 --> 02:00:31,695
[SPEAKER_05]: And water and soil.

1525
02:00:31,735 --> 02:00:33,076
[SPEAKER_05]: This is public participation.

1526
02:00:33,376 --> 02:00:38,422
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my right to say my free speech, and it's my time to say what I want to say, Mr. President.

1527
02:00:39,483 --> 02:00:41,024
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's the problem.

1528
02:00:41,084 --> 02:00:43,266
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't shut somebody off if they're making a point.

1529
02:00:46,249 --> 02:00:48,450
[SPEAKER_07]: The gentleman has a right to free speech.

1530
02:00:48,510 --> 02:00:53,294
[SPEAKER_07]: No one's going to stop him from standing on the front of the stairs of City Hall and screaming at the top of his lungs whatever he wants to talk about.

1531
02:00:53,695 --> 02:00:56,337
[SPEAKER_07]: This is also a city council meeting and there are some parameters that surround it.

1532
02:00:56,597 --> 02:00:59,259
[SPEAKER_07]: So I can certainly respect the gentleman has something to say and I'd like him to finish.

1533
02:00:59,640 --> 02:01:03,123
[SPEAKER_07]: But the same thing being said, you can't just come up here and just start saying whatever you want, whatever you want.

1534
02:01:04,114 --> 02:01:06,235
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, there has to be some parameters and they have to be deployed.

1535
02:01:06,315 --> 02:01:08,716
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I respectfully disagree.

1536
02:01:08,816 --> 02:01:11,697
[SPEAKER_18]: I identify myself.

1537
02:01:12,297 --> 02:01:14,017
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1538
02:01:14,077 --> 02:01:14,558
[SPEAKER_18]: Two points.

1539
02:01:15,358 --> 02:01:19,839
[SPEAKER_18]: One, all speech at any public meeting, according to mass general law is at the discretion of the chair.

1540
02:01:20,399 --> 02:01:27,802
[SPEAKER_18]: Second, the pension liability, that's essentially the IRS final rule on the ARP came out yesterday.

1541
02:01:28,498 --> 02:01:30,438
[SPEAKER_18]: which is also the day that the final amount came out.

1542
02:01:30,778 --> 02:01:32,179
[SPEAKER_18]: That's from the Department of the Treasury.

1543
02:01:32,379 --> 02:01:35,139
[SPEAKER_18]: Pension liabilities cannot be funded using ARP money.

1544
02:01:35,799 --> 02:01:37,320
[SPEAKER_18]: And there were a few other categories.

1545
02:01:38,140 --> 02:01:43,321
[SPEAKER_18]: We've had several resolutions on the issue and I was reading a 130 page letter yesterday.

1546
02:01:43,341 --> 02:01:47,021
[SPEAKER_18]: So I can tell you that this council is on top of the ARP.

1547
02:01:48,401 --> 02:01:48,702
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1548
02:01:48,962 --> 02:01:55,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, with all due respect to the unfunded liability, if you look at the budget for the last four years, it's not been funded.

1549
02:01:55,843 --> 02:01:56,163
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1550
02:01:58,266 --> 02:02:00,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, thank you.

1551
02:02:00,787 --> 02:02:09,212
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we have public participation from Maureen Ronin, 43 Winter Street Method Mass.

1552
02:02:10,092 --> 02:02:14,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Maureen would like to discuss Massachusetts dyslexia guidelines.

1553
02:02:15,155 --> 02:02:18,017
[SPEAKER_06]: Maureen, are you on the call here?

1554
02:02:18,117 --> 02:02:19,237
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Maureen.

1555
02:02:20,918 --> 02:02:23,760
[SPEAKER_06]: Maureen, are you able to touch the record, please?

1556
02:02:25,110 --> 02:02:29,833
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Maureen Rodine and I live at 43 Winter Street in Medford.

1557
02:02:32,115 --> 02:02:33,475
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having me here tonight.

1558
02:02:33,696 --> 02:02:39,219
[SPEAKER_01]: I spoke to the school committee last night and my community participation tonight is very similar.

1559
02:02:39,819 --> 02:02:42,461
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Maureen Rodine and I am the mother of six children.

1560
02:02:42,721 --> 02:02:46,864
[SPEAKER_01]: My three elementary school age children struggle significantly with reading.

1561
02:02:47,392 --> 02:02:52,219
[SPEAKER_01]: They work with dedicated and professional teachers that genuinely care about the children.

1562
02:02:52,820 --> 02:03:03,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Recently, the Department of Education released the Massachusetts Dyslexia Guidelines to help guide districts and families understand and remediate this common language-based learning disability.

1563
02:03:04,445 --> 02:03:10,212
[SPEAKER_01]: On page 49 of these guidelines, it references the Every Student Succeeds Act, also called ESSA.

1564
02:03:10,713 --> 02:03:12,876
[SPEAKER_01]: This federal law was passed in 2015.

1565
02:03:12,996 --> 02:03:20,225
[SPEAKER_01]: It mandates that all reading intervention be evidence-based and peer-reviewed and published in a scientific journal.

1566
02:03:20,725 --> 02:03:29,770
[SPEAKER_01]: This effectively eliminates the eclectic approach that is also referred to as pulling from different reading programs that takes place in this district.

1567
02:03:30,311 --> 02:03:35,714
[SPEAKER_01]: Our teachers need support and training in order to deliver evidence-based reading instruction with fidelity.

1568
02:03:36,214 --> 02:03:45,647
[SPEAKER_01]: Our ETLs need to be trained in evidence-based reading instruction so that they know that a student is receiving appropriate services in accordance with this federal law.

1569
02:03:46,167 --> 02:03:51,995
[SPEAKER_01]: My second grade son's IEP states that he will use, and I quote, picture cues to decode.

1570
02:03:52,623 --> 02:03:57,327
[SPEAKER_01]: This is guessing and is completely inappropriate as it is not evidence-based and peer-reviewed.

1571
02:03:57,768 --> 02:04:04,373
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually interferes with learning to read because it takes the student's eyes away from the letters on the page.

1572
02:04:05,094 --> 02:04:08,176
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that the district has made some changes in early literacy.

1573
02:04:08,597 --> 02:04:11,800
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we are still using journeys as a core curriculum.

1574
02:04:12,300 --> 02:04:19,967
[SPEAKER_01]: This program is so flawed that it is effectively banned in several states because it lacks some of the essential components for reading instruction.

1575
02:04:20,467 --> 02:04:26,629
[SPEAKER_01]: The district recently bought a patch, but it's too little and does not address the students that already went through the program.

1576
02:04:27,330 --> 02:04:34,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Our teachers are required to use DRA and some, I've seen, found this in Pinnell for reading assessments.

1577
02:04:34,777 --> 02:04:43,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Independent testing has stated that a teacher would be more accurate, percentage-wise, predicting reading failure if she just flipped a coin.

1578
02:04:43,881 --> 02:04:50,485
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally reached out to Dr. Matthew Burns, who led this study, and he wrote that it is terrible at identifying struggling readers

1579
02:04:51,963 --> 02:04:56,364
[SPEAKER_01]: and that most kids who struggled with reading cannot read a book at their level.

1580
02:04:56,944 --> 02:04:58,225
[SPEAKER_01]: Prevention is the key to this.

1581
02:04:58,805 --> 02:05:09,587
[SPEAKER_01]: I am asking that all pre-K to K-8th grade general ed teachers and the administration take professional development in the language essentials for teaching, reading, and spelling.

1582
02:05:09,807 --> 02:05:11,868
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called Letters by Dr. Louisa Moats.

1583
02:05:12,568 --> 02:05:25,696
[SPEAKER_01]: I am asking that every single special education teacher that supports students academically be trained and certified in LITS, Orton-Gillingham, and REBA, which are all evidence-based and peer-reviewed reading intervention.

1584
02:05:26,276 --> 02:05:32,580
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am asking for the district to hire a consultant that is an expert in literacy to substantially help guide them.

1585
02:05:33,160 --> 02:05:39,064
[SPEAKER_01]: We also need one person that oversees all tiers of reading instruction and is accountable for ESSA compliance.

1586
02:05:39,724 --> 02:05:42,645
[SPEAKER_01]: All of our children deserve to be taught to read in school.

1587
02:05:43,025 --> 02:05:56,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Literacy should not be reserved for the lucky few that learn to read with little instruction or those with parents that have a lot of money for neuropsychological testing, tutors, advocates, lawyers, and special dyslexia schools.

1588
02:05:56,909 --> 02:06:07,472
[SPEAKER_01]: I am asking for you to provide significant funding to our schools so that our teachers are trained in evidence-based reading instruction and that our children are taught to read.

1589
02:06:07,972 --> 02:06:08,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1590
02:06:09,687 --> 02:06:10,328
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Maureen.

1591
02:06:12,029 --> 02:06:12,329
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1592
02:06:12,769 --> 02:06:18,374
[SPEAKER_07]: I just think it would be important to point out that the city council does not set the bottom line dollar amount for the budget.

1593
02:06:18,414 --> 02:06:22,217
[SPEAKER_07]: That bottom line dollar amount for the budget is set by the mayor.

1594
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:32,587
[SPEAKER_07]: And the mayor is also the one that would dictate how much money she would intend to spend on the school department and how much money she would intend to spend here on the city side.

1595
02:06:33,408 --> 02:06:39,013
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe last year we did a 60-40 split, if I'm not mistaken, or maybe 50-50.

1596
02:06:39,553 --> 02:06:42,796
[SPEAKER_07]: But with that being said, Mr. President, I can certainly appreciate what you're saying.

1597
02:06:43,156 --> 02:06:46,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Mrs. Rowan and I have spoken in the past on this very same topic.

1598
02:06:46,979 --> 02:06:52,404
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a school committee policy issue, and it's my hope that the school committee takes the appropriate steps to comply with federal law

1599
02:06:53,950 --> 02:06:54,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Vice President Haynes.

1600
02:06:56,171 --> 02:06:58,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Maureen, thank you very much for coming this evening.

1601
02:06:59,713 --> 02:07:00,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1602
02:07:00,533 --> 02:07:00,913
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1603
02:07:01,774 --> 02:07:05,636
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, I see Joanna Quateria Mejia with their hand up.

1604
02:07:09,337 --> 02:07:10,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Joanna Quateria, did you have your hand up?

1605
02:07:12,879 --> 02:07:13,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Joanna?

1606
02:07:14,100 --> 02:07:15,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I had to unmute, I do.

1607
02:07:15,600 --> 02:07:17,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Joanna.

1608
02:07:17,181 --> 02:07:18,202
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address of the record, please.

1609
02:07:18,802 --> 02:07:19,922
[SPEAKER_00]: Joanna Quateria Mejia, 35 Early Ave.

1610
02:07:21,777 --> 02:07:27,621
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to state that it's absolutely important that we respect each other's freedom of speech.

1611
02:07:28,221 --> 02:07:36,967
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I am going to, through you, say to the three speakers that spoke about free speech, it's not what you say, it's how you say it.

1612
02:07:37,427 --> 02:07:45,012
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you come on social media and you say things that are going to get people angry, then certainly people are going to say things back.

1613
02:07:46,943 --> 02:07:53,027
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing I wanted to say is I will participate any way I want, Mr. Bender.

1614
02:07:53,567 --> 02:07:56,068
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to be remote, I'll be remote.

1615
02:07:56,769 --> 02:08:00,571
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I feel comfortable, I'll come to the chambers and I hope to meet you there.

1616
02:08:01,251 --> 02:08:01,612
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1617
02:08:03,333 --> 02:08:03,993
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Joanna.

1618
02:08:04,353 --> 02:08:15,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, Vice President Knight, on that topic, I mean, ultimately, you know, I don't think the Medford City Council's gonna take up the role of being the Facebook police or the social media police of the city of Medford.

1619
02:08:16,633 --> 02:08:16,973
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

1620
02:08:17,493 --> 02:08:19,274
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I just don't think that that's what we're here for.

1621
02:08:19,314 --> 02:08:24,336
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't think that that's, you know, uh, really falls into the line of things that move mentioned forward.

1622
02:08:24,676 --> 02:08:29,197
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, so with that being said, I can appreciate the speakers feeling uncomfortable about online bullying.

1623
02:08:29,597 --> 02:08:33,919
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, you know, it's something that we see every day from kids on up to adults, apparently.

1624
02:08:34,319 --> 02:08:44,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, but with that being said, Mr. President, I personally don't think that, um, the Medford city council is the appropriate forum, uh, to air your grievances regarding what people said about you on Facebook and how they said it.

1625
02:08:45,363 --> 02:08:45,663
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1626
02:08:46,575 --> 02:08:56,702
[SPEAKER_18]: Mr. President, if I may come to this, I just want to completely agree with Councilor Knight and the whole purpose of the First Amendment is that the government shouldn't get in the business of regulating speech in the first place.

1627
02:08:56,782 --> 02:08:58,323
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's not our prerogative.

1628
02:08:58,363 --> 02:09:02,026
[SPEAKER_18]: And the best way we can honor the First Amendment is to not do that.

1629
02:09:02,406 --> 02:09:02,726
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

1630
02:09:03,447 --> 02:09:03,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1631
02:09:04,668 --> 02:09:08,951
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, we have one more person on the public participation.

1632
02:09:08,971 --> 02:09:10,852
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. big lonely name and address of the record, please.

1633
02:09:16,793 --> 02:09:18,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Viglione, name and address of the record, please.

1634
02:09:18,494 --> 02:09:19,434
[SPEAKER_19]: Hi, can you hear me okay?

1635
02:09:19,855 --> 02:09:24,317
[SPEAKER_19]: Joe Viglione, 446 Charles Street, Marlin, Massachusetts.

1636
02:09:25,898 --> 02:09:27,058
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, councilors.

1637
02:09:27,679 --> 02:09:36,083
[SPEAKER_19]: About 2009, when Judge Jackson Thompson was in the room, the city solicitor at the time said that the city does not chill free speech.

1638
02:09:36,623 --> 02:09:44,948
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's the essence of what the petitioners were trying to say tonight, about the city chilling free speech, and maybe

1639
02:09:45,928 --> 02:09:47,209
[SPEAKER_19]: That should be the topic.

1640
02:09:47,309 --> 02:09:53,734
[SPEAKER_19]: We should find a way for people to actually express themselves at the access station, at the city council.

1641
02:09:54,255 --> 02:09:55,035
[SPEAKER_19]: That's all I have to say.

1642
02:09:55,055 --> 02:09:59,859
[SPEAKER_19]: I want to applaud them for coming up and showing the courage to discuss this issue.

1643
02:10:00,240 --> 02:10:00,600
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1644
02:10:01,361 --> 02:10:02,261
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Biglioni.

1645
02:10:04,143 --> 02:10:06,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Any further participation from the public?

1646
02:10:06,385 --> 02:10:07,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't see any hands up.

1647
02:10:08,446 --> 02:10:10,468
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me, I see one more.

1648
02:10:11,108 --> 02:10:13,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Castagnetti, name and address of the record, please.

1649
02:10:17,022 --> 02:10:19,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Castagnetti, name and address of the record, please.

1650
02:10:21,786 --> 02:10:22,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

1651
02:10:23,407 --> 02:10:25,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, Mr. Castagnetti, name and address, please.

1652
02:10:26,089 --> 02:10:28,671
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually having a cigarette inside my fireplace.

1653
02:10:29,091 --> 02:10:30,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I was waving at my cigarette.

1654
02:10:31,393 --> 02:10:33,494
[SPEAKER_03]: However, that's okay.

1655
02:10:33,834 --> 02:10:37,077
[SPEAKER_03]: However, since I have an invitation.

1656
02:10:39,899 --> 02:10:40,599
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought you were waving.

1657
02:10:40,619 --> 02:10:41,520
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

1658
02:10:42,260 --> 02:10:44,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell you what, I'll say a few words.

1659
02:10:44,502 --> 02:10:45,683
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be remiss not to.

1660
02:10:47,033 --> 02:10:47,453
[SPEAKER_03]: May I?

1661
02:10:54,959 --> 02:10:56,079
[SPEAKER_06]: We lost you, Mr. Castagnetti.

1662
02:10:59,942 --> 02:11:00,783
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll try to get you back.

1663
02:11:00,803 --> 02:11:02,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Excuse me, did you want to speak?

1664
02:11:03,245 --> 02:11:04,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Name and address on the record, please.

1665
02:11:05,066 --> 02:11:06,927
[SPEAKER_08]: Dave Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave, Medford.

1666
02:11:07,908 --> 02:11:12,811
[SPEAKER_08]: Not related to free speech or anything like that, but as a resident, and I'm sure some of you have actually driven by my house.

1667
02:11:13,492 --> 02:11:14,953
[SPEAKER_08]: I live right near Wegmans.

1668
02:11:15,923 --> 02:11:16,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Trash pickup.

1669
02:11:17,224 --> 02:11:18,845
[SPEAKER_08]: Normally our trash is picked up on Monday.

1670
02:11:19,165 --> 02:11:21,326
[SPEAKER_08]: My trash barrel is still out from waste management.

1671
02:11:21,466 --> 02:11:22,106
[SPEAKER_08]: It is Tuesday.

1672
02:11:22,546 --> 02:11:23,667
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know when they are coming.

1673
02:11:24,367 --> 02:11:31,051
[SPEAKER_08]: Should everyone on Riverside Ave be calling the phone number that's given to report this trash pickup, or is this something that could be handled?

1674
02:11:32,111 --> 02:11:38,755
[SPEAKER_07]: I would recommend calling Mary in the DPW office, and she'll be able to help coordinate the trash pickup.

1675
02:11:38,775 --> 02:11:39,775
[SPEAKER_07]: But if they missed the whole street.

1676
02:11:40,116 --> 02:11:41,256
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they missed the whole street.

1677
02:11:41,316 --> 02:11:44,438
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why, if it was just me, I would call the number, but you look up and down.

1678
02:11:45,299 --> 02:11:48,541
[SPEAKER_07]: Give a call to the DPW, and I'm sure that we can make that phone call in the morning.

1679
02:11:48,561 --> 02:11:58,227
[SPEAKER_07]: We can direct the city clerk to do such to have them be sure that they inform the mayor's office through the DPW and Mayor Menezes that trash pickup on Riverside Ave was skipped on Monday.

1680
02:11:59,388 --> 02:12:00,629
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will offer that in the form of a motion.

1681
02:12:03,851 --> 02:12:07,973
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1682
02:12:08,033 --> 02:12:08,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

1683
02:12:08,174 --> 02:12:08,954
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no motion.

1684
02:12:09,074 --> 02:12:09,614
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, that's fine.

1685
02:12:09,634 --> 02:12:11,416
[SPEAKER_06]: The clerk will call in the morning.

1686
02:12:14,558 --> 02:12:23,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, and just because I know you do have a budget coming up, maybe one thing to consider are metrics in terms of, because this isn't the first time that this is happening with waste management.

1687
02:12:23,963 --> 02:12:30,746
[SPEAKER_08]: So perhaps if you do have missed pickups or whatnot, that's something y'all being interested in, perhaps you can use this some leverage to set the rate in the future.

1688
02:12:31,106 --> 02:12:31,407
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1689
02:12:31,967 --> 02:12:32,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, sir.

1690
02:12:33,588 --> 02:12:35,929
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Kessler, did you want to speak or not?

1691
02:12:37,830 --> 02:12:39,931
[SPEAKER_06]: No, okay, thank you.

1692
02:12:40,171 --> 02:12:42,132
[SPEAKER_06]: Records were passed to Councilor Marks.

1693
02:12:42,212 --> 02:12:44,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks, how did you find those records?

1694
02:12:46,308 --> 02:12:50,051
[SPEAKER_09]: President, I have time to review the records and ask that they be reviewed next week.
