00:00:56,558 --> 00:00:57,758
So I will call the roll.

9
00:00:57,778 --> 00:01:01,640
Let's see, where did it go?

10
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:07,923
Here we go.

11
00:01:09,184 --> 00:01:14,587
Member Graham here, Mayor Lungo Kern, do not see her yet.

12
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:15,347
Libby Brown?

13
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:15,447
Here.

14
00:01:19,153 --> 00:01:20,334
And Erin Olopade.

15
00:01:20,354 --> 00:01:21,254
Here.

16
00:01:24,855 --> 00:01:25,776
Larry Brown.

17
00:01:25,796 --> 00:01:29,417
I don't see Larry yet.

18
00:01:31,478 --> 00:01:32,298
Bob Dickinson.

19
00:01:32,318 --> 00:01:42,202
Hi, Bob.

20
00:01:42,922 --> 00:01:44,843
And Fiona Maxwell.

21
00:01:49,593 --> 00:01:55,680
Oh, you're on mute, but I think you said yeah.

22
00:01:55,860 --> 00:02:02,488
Okay, so for attendance purposes, we have three present, one absent.

23
00:02:03,209 --> 00:02:05,191
So the meeting can be called to order.

24
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:09,795
We also thank you, Alicia, for joining us.

25
00:02:12,077 --> 00:02:23,727
I invited Alicia, who's our head of everything, it seems, development and sustainability and something else, right, Alicia?

26
00:02:25,527 --> 00:02:27,629
planning, development, and sustainability.

27
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:28,350
Thank you.

28
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:29,651
I knew I was forgetting something.

29
00:02:30,632 --> 00:02:36,999
Because a lot of the things that we'll be talking about certainly have some crossover into Alicia's world.

30
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:41,264
Thank you for being here and for joining us.

31
00:02:42,465 --> 00:02:45,488
We have just two items on our agenda for tonight.

32
00:02:45,868 --> 00:02:52,895
And certainly if we have if people have questions along the way, it's a small group and you can feel free to stop me.

33
00:02:52,915 --> 00:02:57,200
And I can I'm happy to field those questions as best I can.

34
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,541
We have two agenda items.

35
00:02:58,581 --> 00:02:59,342
So one was

36
00:03:00,643 --> 00:03:11,805
to start a discussion about potential sites for Medford High School that would inform our next steps in the process, which ultimately is getting towards a feasibility study.

37
00:03:12,545 --> 00:03:19,907
And then the other thing that we have on our agenda is to discuss the anticipated budget for the feasibility study.

38
00:03:20,747 --> 00:03:23,507
And if the mayor's not here, we may just table that.

39
00:03:23,687 --> 00:03:26,288
But when we talk about potential sites,

40
00:03:28,149 --> 00:03:45,690
I think there have been some questions raised in the community, certainly over the period of years, around how to think about a new Medford High School and where it might be, and I think certainly where it is right now is one very viable option, but I think there is

41
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:54,616
Like a sort of a broader sense of possibility, potentially, in terms of what we might be thinking about.

42
00:03:55,316 --> 00:04:04,842
And I, we don't need to make any decisions tonight, but I wanted to start the conversation because if there is a broadening of, like, what needs to be studied in the feasibility study, we'll need to know that.

43
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:10,405
in order to start to sort of weave that into our process and our application.

44
00:04:10,505 --> 00:04:13,667
So that's our first agenda item.

45
00:04:15,328 --> 00:04:19,671
And I am happy to take any comments that you all have.

46
00:04:19,731 --> 00:04:24,954
So, you know, Fiona and Bob, you may not have as much to say about that.

47
00:04:24,994 --> 00:04:25,994
That's totally fine.

48
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:32,058
But just trying to start to think through, you know, as a group, where do we

49
00:04:34,017 --> 00:04:40,541
you know, where do we begin in terms of sort of what is possible?

50
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:43,242
And so, Alicia, thank you for being here.

51
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:46,964
That's certainly a very helpful person to have on the team.

52
00:04:48,085 --> 00:04:53,388
So I will stop talking and see if there's any questions, comments, thoughts, that kind of thing.

53
00:04:53,408 --> 00:04:55,909
I have a question.

54
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:56,830
Sure.

55
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,093
I'm not sure what other sites have ever been discussed until this project has been kind of in the

56
00:05:02,788 --> 00:05:04,308
you know, daydreams for a long time.

57
00:05:04,328 --> 00:05:11,910
And clearly when they built the high school in the 70s, I would assume what was there was woodlands before, was part of the fell.

58
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:17,591
So I can't imagine taking any other chunks of woods or any other sites in the city.

59
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:25,112
So I don't know if there's already any places that have been thought of or city-owned land that could even be an option.

60
00:05:25,132 --> 00:05:28,833
It feels like there might not be a lot of other places.

61
00:05:31,361 --> 00:05:33,383
Yeah, I think that is certainly possible.

62
00:05:33,403 --> 00:05:33,963
I have.

63
00:05:34,343 --> 00:05:36,225
I have certainly heard people talk about.

64
00:05:36,845 --> 00:05:38,907
Place dead park as a possibility.

65
00:05:38,927 --> 00:05:39,868
Yeah.

66
00:05:39,888 --> 00:05:49,656
And I guess if you're going to talk about place, then you could talk about potentially any of those, like, sort of open green spaces, which all are under city control.

67
00:05:52,238 --> 00:05:56,640
Not that I want to sort of be the committee that takes parks out of Medford.

68
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,820
I'm not saying that, I promise.

69
00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,002
It will be a swamp.

70
00:06:01,282 --> 00:06:08,665
But I know that that at least sounds like it has been a discussion over the course of years in the city.

71
00:06:08,685 --> 00:06:16,088
And certainly, as people speculate about what this project could be, that comes up fairly often.

72
00:06:16,128 --> 00:06:19,550
And I think it comes up often because at some point in time,

73
00:06:21,122 --> 00:06:24,345
There was a discussion about if there was going to be a new high school, could it be somewhere else?

74
00:06:24,686 --> 00:06:28,229
And somehow that seems to have been the thing that sort of stuck in the.

75
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:30,317
public purview.

76
00:06:30,817 --> 00:06:31,017
Right.

77
00:06:31,197 --> 00:06:42,120
And criteria, I assume for thinking about this, you know, obviously there are lots of parks, but I mean, centrally located access to, if not transportation, like major roads, so easy to get to.

78
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:49,362
I mean, I had a place that the benefit being it backs up to the train line, so it's not necessarily butting up to a bunch of houses.

79
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:50,803
Yeah.

80
00:06:51,363 --> 00:06:52,603
Those are the criteria.

81
00:06:53,523 --> 00:06:57,484
It's definitely not centrally located in the city, but neither is the high school right now.

82
00:06:57,705 --> 00:06:57,965
Yeah.

83
00:06:58,205 --> 00:06:58,765
Not much better.

84
00:06:58,785 --> 00:06:58,945
Yeah.

85
00:06:59,765 --> 00:07:10,228
I do hear, I hear a lot of people talk about how it is not central in the city and it is not particularly easy to get to.

86
00:07:10,248 --> 00:07:14,049
I can sort of speak to like, our busing situation.

87
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:17,250
So, currently we provide buses.

88
00:07:20,246 --> 00:07:27,890
at for those students who are more than two miles outside of the school zone in the secondary level.

89
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:29,291
So that includes middle school and high school.

90
00:07:30,532 --> 00:07:34,954
The way we do that at the high school is in part through MBTA buses.

91
00:07:35,674 --> 00:07:40,757
And then there is some yellow bus service to North Medford where there is no MBTA service.

92
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:47,240
So certainly central location is something that's been discussed a whole bunch of times.

93
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:50,102
over the years.

94
00:07:52,723 --> 00:08:03,630
That certainly is a factor when we think about the high school and the sheer amount of traffic that has to get to and from every day.

95
00:08:07,392 --> 00:08:07,732
Leisha?

96
00:08:08,252 --> 00:08:15,657
There's a lot of stuff that I could say about these various things.

97
00:08:16,807 --> 00:08:23,889
And I was wondering if you wanted, is it more useful for me to sort of throw out a bunch of information?

98
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:30,931
Because as you were talking, there have been speculation for a very long time.

99
00:08:31,171 --> 00:08:39,474
And in the planning office, we've thought about these things as we did things like comprehensive plan and what could change and why should it change.

100
00:08:39,494 --> 00:08:40,955
I mean, honestly,

101
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:52,881
As planners, we lament the fact that Medford high school ever moved out of Medford square, because that was such invigoration to the.

102
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:57,341
to the business district here, it really changed things.

103
00:08:57,381 --> 00:09:01,244
People talk about how the square used to be a long time ago, much more vibrant.

104
00:09:01,544 --> 00:09:16,015
Well, frankly, if you had a thousand high school students here, it would really, but don't get me wrong, high school students come to the square and so do middle school students, perhaps not in the droves that they would have when the school was here.

105
00:09:16,035 --> 00:09:16,055
I,

106
00:09:21,157 --> 00:09:25,260
In my mind, anything is literally possible with enough money.

107
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:30,984
I don't think we have unlimited money and I want to recognize that, that is attention.

108
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:35,627
One could in fact buy that old location and knock it down and build.

109
00:09:35,647 --> 00:09:42,012
It's possible, it's just not possible for Medford at this time in this financial situation.

110
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:43,614
I'm assuming.

111
00:09:43,855 --> 00:09:52,652
But I wanted to say that I like to state my assumptions explicitly in case I'm missing something that other people see.

112
00:09:55,025 --> 00:09:59,608
I do, when you mentioned the transportation issue, there are a couple of things that I should flag.

113
00:10:00,188 --> 00:10:07,713
No matter where in the city you put this, transportation is going to be an issue for North Medford because it's hilly, it's windy.

114
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,435
MBTA doesn't get buses up there.

115
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:13,657
I was literally talking to somebody from the state about that today.

116
00:10:15,498 --> 00:10:26,422
about why do our school buses fit but not MBTA buses, and they thought it might have to do with the clearance and how low to the ground the buses go, because that's why there's no MBTA.

117
00:10:26,502 --> 00:10:35,685
I mean, it's not the only reason, but there's actual, like MBTA has said to us, we cannot run our large ADA buses through Fulton Heights.

118
00:10:36,225 --> 00:10:37,586
It doesn't literally work.

119
00:10:39,446 --> 00:10:44,789
So when you say, well, it's not accessible, the problem is it's always not gonna be accessible somewhere.

120
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:47,330
The MBTA system is not the best.

121
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:55,654
And we do have a working group on transportation that is talking about the transportation issues.

122
00:10:56,154 --> 00:10:58,435
That's actually why I was talking to the state today.

123
00:10:58,475 --> 00:11:04,078
So we have some city counselors, Peter and some, oh my gosh,

124
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:20,371
Megan from the schools are meeting with us along with some transportation companies, staff from my office, our traffic director, Pam from the senior center, someone from West Medford Community Center.

125
00:11:20,591 --> 00:11:22,453
We're starting to try to talk about this.

126
00:11:22,913 --> 00:11:24,234
We're talking to other communities.

127
00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:25,996
How do they choose transportation?

128
00:11:26,556 --> 00:11:38,101
We're looking at grants around electric school buses and whether owning our own school buses would be cost effective and would also solve some of our transportation equity issues.

129
00:11:38,181 --> 00:11:48,785
I'm not saying that we're definitely doing it, but we were going to look into it to see if is this something that's worth proposing to the schools and to the city as something

130
00:11:49,185 --> 00:12:02,153
that could make sense and we were in fact talking to the state today about technical assistance and grants for micro transit which is what they call when you run your own little bus and stuff within the city.

131
00:12:02,713 --> 00:12:08,457
So it's all stuff we're looking into and I wouldn't want to cite a new school just on transit.

132
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,920
simply because you can move transportation.

133
00:12:14,902 --> 00:12:18,104
But once you pick a site for the building, that site is done.

134
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:35,819
I pulled out our open space and rec plan because one of the things that that does do is that there is a map that has, and I'm sure I can get it online and point people to it, but at the moment I had a copy sitting on my desk.

135
00:12:37,975 --> 00:12:49,982
There is a map in there and the map I'm currently looking at is regional context, but it marks which green spaces are permanently protected and which are limited protection.

136
00:12:50,743 --> 00:12:58,968
The reason I do it with quotes is because in my experience, even something that's permanently protected can be swapped for something else.

137
00:12:59,048 --> 00:13:04,912
Like here's a space that's not protected, we'll permanently protect that to lift this protection over here.

138
00:13:05,392 --> 00:13:10,435
So there can't be net loss, and it's not always easy, but it can be done.

139
00:13:10,995 --> 00:13:21,200
And I say that because two of the places that have kind of percolated, there's Playstead, that is not permanently protected.

140
00:13:21,321 --> 00:13:23,702
That's got limited protection on it.

141
00:13:26,511 --> 00:13:37,734
But my concern is it is taking it, the school from what is somewhat centrally located, it's like in the- Making it worse.

142
00:13:37,914 --> 00:13:49,897
Middle, and you're really shoving it into the far corner with the wealthiest families or all the wealthiest neighborhoods and the biggest houses they can walk, and everybody else has a long haul to get there.

143
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:52,038
I don't really love it.

144
00:13:52,738 --> 00:14:00,763
It's near station, but it's commuter rail, it's completely useless to our students in any and every way, I mean, for school.

145
00:14:00,783 --> 00:14:03,065
Yeah.

146
00:14:03,285 --> 00:14:20,977
That's where I'm not loving it as a location, but if one had a need to say what are possible locations and then let's check off the pros and cons, it's rational to put it on the list so one can say, we did a comparison of possible sites.

147
00:14:22,823 --> 00:14:26,545
The other one that has been bounced around more recently is Tufts Park.

148
00:14:27,965 --> 00:14:37,328
That one does have the label permanently protected on it, and I'd have to poke a little harder into this to see what that quote permanent protection is.

149
00:14:37,348 --> 00:14:50,613
I like that as an area a little better because if you're going to push it into one corner of the city, that's our lower income area.

150
00:14:51,054 --> 00:14:58,220
Those are the students for whom if the bus isn't running, it's more likely that mom and dad can't hop in a car and come pick them up.

151
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,924
It is making it more accessible to the people who have fewer resources.

152
00:15:03,504 --> 00:15:06,867
So that's sort of a rational thing.

153
00:15:06,887 --> 00:15:10,350
And there are bus lines that go that way.

154
00:15:10,470 --> 00:15:17,356
And with the MBTA improved bus services, they wanna run more buses down Main Street.

155
00:15:18,076 --> 00:15:20,677
I'm not loving it because Main Street's so narrow.

156
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:23,377
That is a highly congested area.

157
00:15:23,397 --> 00:15:26,098
You'd make things worse.

158
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:30,799
But there is a big green open space there.

159
00:15:30,819 --> 00:15:35,640
I don't know if you would have space for a school and parking.

160
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:46,482
There is the Curtis Tufts School, and I think it was at a school committee meeting where they were very recently talking about whether we should be reconsidering the future of that.

161
00:15:49,029 --> 00:15:55,393
My hope is that that building could be repurposed for recreation or community center that the city could desperately need.

162
00:15:57,134 --> 00:16:00,836
But you could certainly include the Curtis Tufts property.

163
00:16:01,497 --> 00:16:03,058
It's our only outdoor pool.

164
00:16:03,438 --> 00:16:04,719
I'd hate to lose that too.

165
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,944
The car park doesn't make any sense for a whole lot.

166
00:16:13,084 --> 00:16:17,167
The transportation is the worst possible for everything.

167
00:16:18,246 --> 00:16:22,928
And it's in the middle of a $7 million renovation, so please don't do that to me.

168
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:32,732
I'm not clear there are any other open spaces.

169
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:37,474
There are commercial areas that we don't own.

170
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:46,450
We did do some site survey assessments when we were looking for the police station.

171
00:16:46,830 --> 00:16:57,918
When we cited the police station where it is, we actually did do some due diligence about are there other locations in the city where you could put a new police station.

172
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:02,421
In that case, we really came down to even if we bought something,

173
00:17:03,768 --> 00:17:07,611
almost everything would not be as centrally located.

174
00:17:07,631 --> 00:17:15,878
Yeah, and we were trying to see if we could get it out of floodplain areas.

175
00:17:19,481 --> 00:17:22,764
Property in Medford right now is really, really expensive.

176
00:17:24,746 --> 00:17:31,872
For us to purchase something doesn't seem reasonable in this climate.

177
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,171
What about like Hormel, that area?

178
00:17:36,211 --> 00:17:44,177
I mean, I know that would involve moving Hormel, but that's- So Hormel is, yeah, it's more complicated protected.

179
00:17:44,197 --> 00:17:55,384
It's level of protection at this point is we do have conservation restriction through the state and a federal conservation restriction on the whole.

180
00:17:55,984 --> 00:17:57,065
Is it on the whole property?

181
00:17:57,585 --> 00:18:01,806
Oh, you know what, we did not end up doing the federal conservation restriction.

182
00:18:02,927 --> 00:18:04,307
It was going to be part of the Clippership.

183
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:11,129
It was going to be our donation to the Clippership Connector was to increase the federal restrictions.

184
00:18:11,209 --> 00:18:14,850
And we it was, I think, approved on the city's end.

185
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:20,171
But then the federal government didn't the state didn't move forward with that piece of it.

186
00:18:23,767 --> 00:18:27,229
So you would have to deal with state conservation restrictions.

187
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:40,778
When we built the schools, the McGlynn and the Andrews, there was actually some conservation restriction swap for the footprints of those.

188
00:18:41,378 --> 00:18:45,621
So those buildings are exempt from the conservation restriction.

189
00:18:46,101 --> 00:18:49,023
And then there's land over in Rivers Edge

190
00:18:49,656 --> 00:18:57,221
that has a conservation restriction in lieu of those two buildings, the footprints of those buildings.

191
00:18:57,761 --> 00:19:02,785
So there would need to be a conservation restriction put somewhere else.

192
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:11,110
I'm wondering what the... It's not completely irrational.

193
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:15,973
I don't know what the... I was just looking at a map to see size-wise.

194
00:19:15,993 --> 00:19:18,295
It'll be tight.

195
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:26,728
It would be that, and then you would be dealing with all the buses.

196
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:27,749
Yeah, 43 schools there.

197
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:34,275
For three, and the congestion of three schools worth of students all in one complex.

198
00:19:35,436 --> 00:19:37,197
I'm sorry to interject here.

199
00:19:37,798 --> 00:19:38,498
Here's a question.

200
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:40,400
Has there been some thought at all about

201
00:19:41,860 --> 00:20:09,743
the moving of one of the middle schools that's in that area and replacing it with the high school, because I know that I've spoken to some people in the community, and this is a question on my own, where if you're to have the high school be more centrally located, as we're talking about, let's say, if you were to replace it with the Andrews, let's just say for the moment, you move the Andrews closer to the West Medford area, so you have both an elementary school in the Brooks, and then you have a middle school in the West Medford, slightly more North Medford area, for example, and then you have the,

202
00:20:10,243 --> 00:20:30,987
Kindergarten through high school, you know more central central to south medford located So would that be I mean that's not crazy I think the reason I hadn't thought about it is because i'm still stuck in the new school's mindset

203
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,354
That building is too.

204
00:20:34,474 --> 00:20:46,301
I mean, the reality is the reason we're looking at the whole electrification HVAC upgrade is because the building itself is too new to be saying, oh, we should replace it.

205
00:20:46,921 --> 00:20:49,182
It really is only 23 years old.

206
00:20:49,202 --> 00:20:50,523
Absolutely.

207
00:20:50,543 --> 00:20:53,605
I think, I mean, it's not a matter of, oh, we should just

208
00:20:54,574 --> 00:21:10,550
remove the building is it is it at all possible to again just ask because we're just you know frying on Hail Mary's here could you could you uh redo the Andrews for example and make it high school age student and and that age appropriate

209
00:21:11,147 --> 00:21:14,588
for example, because I don't want to level the building or start from scratch.

210
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:15,108
I think you're right.

211
00:21:15,128 --> 00:21:19,650
It's too new of a building to do what you would, in theory, do and start from the beginning.

212
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:26,412
But could you use that as a foundation to say, we know how much space we've been using thus far for the Andrews.

213
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:29,934
Could we work off of the standing foundation of the Andrews?

214
00:21:31,714 --> 00:21:33,555
It holds 600 students.

215
00:21:34,035 --> 00:21:39,617
It's got a cafeteria that serves as their auditorium and a gym.

216
00:21:40,937 --> 00:21:45,680
could you, basically what you would do is add on to that building, right?

217
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,963
Like you've seen high schools where they have the old wing and the new wing.

218
00:21:50,544 --> 00:21:59,850
I went to school in a building that was an old school and a new school put together with a building in between them back in my town.

219
00:22:02,652 --> 00:22:05,914
You would have the issue, we would need more of the land around it.

220
00:22:06,514 --> 00:22:07,555
So you would need to

221
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:18,202
deal with some of the conservation restrictions that are on there and replacing that somewhere else, I'm sure.

222
00:22:18,222 --> 00:22:26,225
Yeah, in theory, the Glen would be almost better because it's just got more space that's not already green.

223
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:31,347
Well, it has for now, but of course, then you're displacing two schools because they'll enter schools there too.

224
00:22:32,588 --> 00:22:43,579
Yeah, I think that's partly why I was thinking that McGlynn wouldn't make as much sense because to your point about the two schools, they have a bigger student population and they're having the new playground installed.

225
00:22:43,939 --> 00:22:48,984
The Andrews, less students, but it's an older amount of students.

226
00:22:49,024 --> 00:22:50,766
The students are a different age grouping.

227
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:58,853
that isn't and wouldn't be present if we were to remain, keep the high school, for example, where it is.

228
00:22:59,714 --> 00:23:06,760
So if we were to have the Andrews be closer to the West Bedford area, that would then mean you could have students be able to potentially stay closer to home, for example.

229
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:21,052
That might not be a big thing we need to worry about right now, but I think the McGlynn might need to stay because of what it offers, even though the space itself is more consistent with what we would need to consider that choice.

230
00:23:23,415 --> 00:23:41,343
But what we would end up with would be the cost of doing a major addition and possibly renovation to the Andrews School and you would have to rebuild some sort of or renovate the existing- You would still have the full structural issues of the middle school.

231
00:23:41,863 --> 00:23:42,043
Right.

232
00:23:42,063 --> 00:23:44,064
You still need to put a middle school up there.

233
00:23:44,084 --> 00:23:45,885
Yeah.

234
00:23:46,245 --> 00:23:49,326
You would be talking about two building projects, not one at that time.

235
00:23:49,366 --> 00:23:49,606
Yeah.

236
00:23:49,626 --> 00:23:50,667
That makes sense.

237
00:23:52,503 --> 00:23:55,064
Okay.

238
00:23:56,324 --> 00:24:01,926
When we look at the high school, some of the questions that I've had, is it helpful?

239
00:24:02,286 --> 00:24:06,828
I can't do this without looking at a map and visualizing it, so I have it up on my screen.

240
00:24:06,868 --> 00:24:08,528
I don't know if anybody wants me to share it.

241
00:24:08,548 --> 00:24:09,508
Sure.

242
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:13,189
Can you share or do I need to let you share?

243
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:14,190
You need to let me.

244
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:16,030
Okay.

245
00:24:16,050 --> 00:24:17,811
I'll try that.

246
00:24:20,248 --> 00:24:41,942
I just, I need to be seeing it in order to, and then I think if I make my screen smaller like this, make that, zoom in on this, because I kind of look at this and I think there's, I've had an understanding that the high school is very large for our population.

247
00:24:41,962 --> 00:24:49,046
And one of the concerns is that we are not gonna get, like there's square footage,

248
00:24:50,247 --> 00:24:52,209
calculations that come out of MSBA.

249
00:24:52,289 --> 00:25:02,596
I'm not terribly familiar with them, but I look at this footprint and then I say, I assume we don't need to replace or that we're not going to get a footprint that's this big.

250
00:25:02,616 --> 00:25:04,378
I don't know that.

251
00:25:04,398 --> 00:25:09,241
I think the stories are probably going to be a smaller footprint.

252
00:25:09,501 --> 00:25:09,962
It's my guess.

253
00:25:10,930 --> 00:25:13,631
Yeah, I think there's a couple of variables there, Alicia.

254
00:25:14,251 --> 00:25:27,193
One is that the school committee has voted that they want to see Curtis Tufts come onto the site of the high school in some sort of co-location perspective.

255
00:25:28,473 --> 00:25:37,875
So that's one thing that, and obviously that's like 20 kids, so it's not like substantive in terms of the number of students, but the space needs are very specific.

256
00:25:38,675 --> 00:25:43,877
And the other thing that is part of this grant is our early childhood programming.

257
00:25:43,997 --> 00:25:56,962
So there is a possibility of changing the amount of early childhood programming happening on the property in a way that would expand it.

258
00:25:57,062 --> 00:26:04,065
So the other thing that I think is like sort of dicey is like once you throw in the vocational programming,

259
00:26:05,455 --> 00:26:16,963
The space conversation is completely different than the space conversation about a new high school, but MSBA, you're correct, will go through and they will size the building.

260
00:26:17,864 --> 00:26:24,789
They will size the enrollment, and then I believe the feasibility study will size the building based on that enrollment.

261
00:26:25,558 --> 00:26:36,608
And I assume at this point, everybody who's part of this conversation is familiar with the existing, what's here existing.

262
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:40,912
I am extremely familiar with it from some of the work that I've been doing over the years.

263
00:26:42,193 --> 00:26:54,597
One of the things I've been wondering about is, could we do something where this is the pool in the gym, where we're able to keep the pool in the gym, and then maybe build back here on the field of dreams.

264
00:26:56,978 --> 00:27:03,104
you build a new front door or something, but this remains as part of the new building.

265
00:27:04,585 --> 00:27:06,227
That is something that I've wondered about.

266
00:27:06,327 --> 00:27:16,517
It's already built into a hill where it's three stories here and back here, you are literally entering onto what is the third floor if you walk to the front of the building.

267
00:27:18,018 --> 00:27:25,321
Yeah, I think that's definitely something that we'll consider because edgily is, I mean, you can even see it in the picture.

268
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:27,622
You can see more rubber in the picture than grass.

269
00:27:28,363 --> 00:27:28,723
Wow.

270
00:27:29,643 --> 00:27:29,963
Wow.

271
00:27:30,283 --> 00:27:36,226
So yeah, so we will have to contend with that as well.

272
00:27:36,286 --> 00:27:39,588
But I think some of that, all of that can be studied.

273
00:27:40,168 --> 00:27:44,930
Anything about the current space can certainly be, will certainly be part of the feasibility study.

274
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:46,951
It's really just a question of like,

275
00:27:47,871 --> 00:27:49,652
where are those other possibilities?

276
00:27:49,672 --> 00:27:52,273
Are there any?

277
00:27:54,434 --> 00:27:58,616
If it's helpful for you-all to know, this is a field that is part of the school.

278
00:27:59,216 --> 00:28:03,418
This little area has recently been up for sale.

279
00:28:04,219 --> 00:28:15,184
I was just contacted today by a developer who has the option to buy and he wants to build, I want to say, a subdivision of eight houses here.

280
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:23,951
I was hoping that maybe there I couldn't imagine, though, that the city could have moved fast enough to train by that property.

281
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:29,518
Yeah, but if anybody hears talk about it apparently used to be a horse farm.

282
00:28:29,938 --> 00:28:30,098
Yeah.

283
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:45,990
Yeah, I think that if we're staying on the same site, which I think is entirely feasible, there'll be a fair amount of using either one of those two open spaces, even if just temporarily while construction happens.

284
00:28:46,191 --> 00:28:55,278
I mean, I think it would probably be better to build onto the existing parking lot that's down when you pull in, just so that when you arrive, you're arriving at a school at a front door.

285
00:28:56,118 --> 00:29:00,379
and maybe move parking to another location or it moves once you take something else down.

286
00:29:00,499 --> 00:29:06,921
But there's enough swing space in here to build and then take down or renovate to make the site work.

287
00:29:07,841 --> 00:29:08,401
I'm sure of it.

288
00:29:08,561 --> 00:29:18,103
It's definitely more tricky than a new separate site, since we're obviously not going to move students somewhere else temporarily, but it's doable.

289
00:29:19,444 --> 00:29:19,664
Yeah.

290
00:29:19,704 --> 00:29:19,924
Right.

291
00:29:19,964 --> 00:29:22,945
Well, in COLO, moving things around during

292
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:28,363
construction becomes really tricky with our vocational programs.

293
00:29:28,403 --> 00:29:31,266
So all of that will be part of the feasibility study as well.

294
00:29:31,346 --> 00:29:38,412
But just to say like, you know, it's not the same as like moving a classroom.

295
00:29:38,632 --> 00:29:40,234
It's true.

296
00:29:40,554 --> 00:29:42,515
It's an entirely different sort of undertaking.

297
00:29:42,556 --> 00:29:44,257
So that's something that we'll have to consider as well.

298
00:29:44,317 --> 00:29:47,140
So yeah.

299
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,583
So Alicia, are there any other spaces that

300
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:52,860
come to your mind?

301
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,001
I think this is a perfectly fine working list, by the way.

302
00:29:56,021 --> 00:30:00,443
Right.

303
00:30:00,643 --> 00:30:06,126
As we go across here, there are these commercial industrial areas.

304
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:11,028
The other thing that I don't see how the city could really do it,

305
00:30:12,817 --> 00:30:28,695
But we own this parcel and this parcel in the middle of Medford square, and this one, and there are active plans, we have literally signed a contract in the last few days with a consultant to help us put these out to bid to put.

306
00:30:31,438 --> 00:30:38,900
housing ground floor commercial housing on these properties with the assumption that we would also build a parking garage over here.

307
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,200
We have vision and ideas.

308
00:30:41,461 --> 00:30:47,602
This is a parking garage that we feel is highly underutilized, but it's privately owned.

309
00:30:47,682 --> 00:30:50,903
I'd love to capture this somehow and be able to use it.

310
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:58,745
In a dream world, what if you put the high school here across these properties and that would be

311
00:30:59,805 --> 00:31:15,011
really interesting, but I'm not sure that we can move this boat that quickly to pivot to something like that and we would lose out on all the revenue that we're anticipating from developing this as housing.

312
00:31:15,031 --> 00:31:28,977
I mean, it's not huge revenue, it is revenue, but what if you did that and then you allowed the high school site to be redeveloped and have that site to become housing instead?

313
00:31:30,408 --> 00:31:30,648
Right.

314
00:31:31,488 --> 00:31:33,149
I was wondering about those parking lots.

315
00:31:33,169 --> 00:31:34,430
That seems like a great spot.

316
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:39,252
But it's also good for development.

317
00:31:39,572 --> 00:31:40,692
Anything that's not a parking lot.

318
00:31:41,873 --> 00:31:42,233
Right.

319
00:31:42,513 --> 00:31:43,674
Yeah.

320
00:31:43,854 --> 00:31:50,817
The project has moved slower than I would have liked, but we signed the consultant today.

321
00:31:53,058 --> 00:31:55,639
And none of this, we don't really own any of this.

322
00:31:55,719 --> 00:31:56,540
It's all private.

323
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:59,021
A lot of this is ripe for redevelopment.

324
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:10,987
I will say some of this is so ripe for redevelopment that we have been having conversations with various developers who are talking about what could they do here, be allowed, how can we help them with it?

325
00:32:13,308 --> 00:32:19,992
I can't imagine that we actually would want to put the high school on Mystic Ave, but again, it would be more central.

326
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:27,175
it would really make it hard for anybody to walk to school because of that location.

327
00:32:29,457 --> 00:32:35,159
But in theory, you would improve your streets and your sidewalks and your crossings and your bike paths if you did that.

328
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,920
But that's state road, right?

329
00:32:37,541 --> 00:32:38,621
It is a state road.

330
00:32:38,721 --> 00:32:40,462
Well, it's a state road.

331
00:32:40,482 --> 00:32:42,864
It's local.

332
00:32:45,473 --> 00:32:49,176
From about, I forget exactly.

333
00:32:49,236 --> 00:32:51,817
When I'm on it, you can tell where it drops.

334
00:32:51,957 --> 00:32:52,378
Oh, here.

335
00:32:52,398 --> 00:32:58,441
I think this is actually the line, because you can see the pavement change.

336
00:32:58,722 --> 00:33:11,890
I believe that that's, I do believe that that is this, from here north, this is city, and this part there, that's state, because Eversource paved it as part of the project for the city.

337
00:33:11,910 --> 00:33:12,951
Got it.

338
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:16,782
This must be a really recent photo.

339
00:33:23,505 --> 00:33:29,109
Interestingly, a lot of the owners along here are actually longtime Medford residents.

340
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:33,832
They're not investor developers at this point.

341
00:33:33,992 --> 00:33:40,916
I don't see it as being impossible to negotiate a deal, but I'm not sure it's a great idea.

342
00:33:41,896 --> 00:33:42,156
Yeah.

343
00:33:42,757 --> 00:33:42,917
Okay.

344
00:33:44,666 --> 00:33:58,870
I just feel like it's better to be thorough and to say, we thought about it, we talked about it, and then it, and this area, this is all owned by, I'm going to call him an investor developer, the core power.

345
00:33:58,950 --> 00:34:02,031
I'll just say my yoga studio, okay?

346
00:34:02,131 --> 00:34:03,811
He says it's hugely popular.

347
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:06,572
I met with them last week, so.

348
00:34:06,932 --> 00:34:07,152
Yeah.

349
00:34:08,232 --> 00:34:08,512
Oh, yeah.

350
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:09,613
They pack them in there.

351
00:34:12,366 --> 00:34:13,606
Alicia, thank you for all this.

352
00:34:13,667 --> 00:34:15,407
I think this was really helpful.

353
00:34:16,847 --> 00:34:27,410
I just got access to the MSBA's portal that requires us to submit a bunch of information that feeds enrollment projections.

354
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:34,512
And so, Bob and Alicia, there's definitely some tentacles there that will require your input around

355
00:34:36,557 --> 00:34:41,759
growth, planned growth and that kind of thing.

356
00:34:41,779 --> 00:34:43,960
So I will sort of funnel that off to you.

357
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,460
I've just started looking at it though.

358
00:34:46,200 --> 00:35:00,505
I'm not sure, I don't think there's anywhere where we have to sort of describe this just yet, but perhaps it has to be described in the RFP when we are at the point of like going out either to the OPM or out to

359
00:35:05,014 --> 00:35:06,395
the actual feasibility study.

360
00:35:06,435 --> 00:35:12,078
So hard to say exactly when this information will be useful, but I think it's sort of on the minds of lots of people.

361
00:35:12,138 --> 00:35:21,463
So I'm glad that we had the conversation because now I can assure people that we are talking broadly about all the possibilities and really thinking through all of that.

362
00:35:21,583 --> 00:35:25,204
So I think that was very helpful.

363
00:35:25,245 --> 00:35:25,725
Thank you.

364
00:35:26,345 --> 00:35:30,707
The other item on our agenda for tonight is to start to talk about

365
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:34,312
The anticipated budget for the feasibility study.

366
00:35:34,432 --> 00:35:38,018
So, um, and, you know, I can talk a little bit about next steps.

367
00:35:38,078 --> 00:35:39,380
So before.

368
00:35:41,343 --> 00:35:59,231
before we can get out of the eligibility phase, we have to, the city has to authorize a feasibility, the cost of a feasibility study, and demonstrate to MSBA that we have the money, whatever that mechanism is, and, you know, an amount.

369
00:35:59,471 --> 00:36:05,894
So that, I know I have been talking to the mayor about that, and, you know,

370
00:36:06,861 --> 00:36:11,604
I believe her plan is to use free cash.

371
00:36:12,284 --> 00:36:15,306
At least that's where she was at the last time I spoke with her.

372
00:36:17,908 --> 00:36:25,353
And so we won't need to take a vote to do a bond or a debt exclusion, but the council will have to take some sort of vote.

373
00:36:26,571 --> 00:36:35,413
that authorizes its use and it needs to be in a pile that is demonstrable for the MSBA in order for them to sort of flag us into the next phase.

374
00:36:35,473 --> 00:36:37,893
So procedurally, that's what needs to happen.

375
00:36:37,913 --> 00:36:51,756
As I've been talking to people about sort of what the budget needs to be, I've heard a variety of numbers between two and a quarter and $3 million for the feasibility study.

376
00:36:52,612 --> 00:36:58,693
Roughly half of that, a little bit more than half, it sounds like, would come back to us eventually in this process.

377
00:36:59,594 --> 00:37:03,975
If we get all the way through with MSBA, they do credit you back the same thing as your reimbursement rate.

378
00:37:05,395 --> 00:37:13,037
And when we had our kickoff call with them, I think they said our reimbursement rate was like 52.7 or 52.69 as of that day.

379
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:18,038
So it changes, apparently it can change all the time, but 52% of that would come back.

380
00:37:19,052 --> 00:37:23,675
eventually, but not, but the city has to put the money up front to do the feasibility study.

381
00:37:24,716 --> 00:37:35,064
The other thing that was raised to my attention was that, and actually we took a tour of Arlington High School, and they're in the middle of their project.

382
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:37,826
So part of the building is open, part of it is not.

383
00:37:38,166 --> 00:37:43,270
And they said something sort of related, which was, we're still learning how to use this building.

384
00:37:44,270 --> 00:37:49,476
And there's all kinds of things that happen in the building where they're like, Oh, there's something wrong with the building.

385
00:37:49,596 --> 00:37:56,783
And it just turns out like they don't know how to use the building, like the entire infrastructure of the building is different than what they're used to.

386
00:37:56,843 --> 00:37:58,705
And so they're very much in this like learning process.

387
00:37:59,886 --> 00:38:04,491
So our CFO at the school said that it's not uncommon for districts to

388
00:38:05,812 --> 00:38:23,658
In addition to bringing on the OPM and ultimately the designer to bring somebody on on the district side to ride sort of side saddle with the project and really intimately understand all of the various components

389
00:38:24,738 --> 00:38:34,780
of the build and how it works and how it's envisioned to work and how the plan changed to the actual and all of that from a facilities maintenance perspective.

390
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:43,882
That's a job that's bigger than the director of facilities just being able to do that in addition to all the other things that he does already.

391
00:38:47,023 --> 00:39:05,574
Jerry was saying that the other thing we might consider is, and I need to connect back with him on this, but the other thing we might consider is making sure that that set aside funded this position that helps us smooth that out and bridge the gap over time.

392
00:39:05,955 --> 00:39:09,357
That's another thing that we need to think about in terms of funding.

393
00:39:11,330 --> 00:39:20,934
So I, you know, by all the accounts that I've heard, somewhere between two and a half and three is probably the right amount of money based on all the things that have to happen.

394
00:39:21,974 --> 00:39:31,117
But Bob and Fiona, I wasn't sure whether you had resources that you could tap into in terms of other procurements.

395
00:39:32,597 --> 00:39:43,680
and the budgets being set for communities like ours for these processes that might help inform that ultimate number that needs to be set aside.

396
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:58,945
And I don't know what sort of digging and investigating you all have done in your free time on this up till now, and I don't know sort of how you are connected to other communities, but I wanted to give you some space to talk to us about what those,

397
00:39:59,925 --> 00:40:12,050
where you might have information that could plug into that, or even Alicia, if you have those connections, how can we leverage the city side and talk about all of that as well actively?

398
00:40:23,515 --> 00:40:27,097
Well, I don't have any experience

399
00:40:27,856 --> 00:40:30,397
in building a school or doing any of this.

400
00:40:30,818 --> 00:40:33,939
So I really don't know.

401
00:40:33,959 --> 00:40:46,566
Nantucket built a new intermediate school six, seven years ago.

402
00:40:46,586 --> 00:40:54,951
So I could call up my buddy Martin and see if he knows anything about it.

403
00:40:55,011 --> 00:40:57,412
But again, it's that,

404
00:40:59,325 --> 00:41:14,658
You know, that process... Nantucket had the land, they knew where they were building it, and the entire budget for it was one-tenth of what we're talking here.

405
00:41:14,758 --> 00:41:17,881
So... Yeah, there's a big difference between a middle school and a high school.

406
00:41:17,961 --> 00:41:22,645
Also, then you have building on Nantucket, which is entirely different than building here.

407
00:41:23,145 --> 00:41:23,446
Yeah.

408
00:41:23,506 --> 00:41:23,806
Yeah.

409
00:41:24,246 --> 00:41:25,848
You know, the Nantucket thing is,

410
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:48,460
I think probably a good 10% of the cost of building the new school was simply staging costs for the contractor to get equipment and people over here and rent housing for the people to build it, which would be slightly different than it is in Medford, where hopefully there's somebody around here with a crane.

411
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,281
Do you know what I mean?

412
00:41:51,421 --> 00:41:52,482
With a few cranes.

413
00:41:53,062 --> 00:41:53,302
Yeah.

414
00:41:56,250 --> 00:41:59,172
I could talk to Martin about it.

415
00:42:00,253 --> 00:42:06,238
Yeah, I mean, I think that Nantucket is a very different place for all those reasons you cite.

416
00:42:06,278 --> 00:42:13,243
I don't know, Fiona, if you are connected to other purchasing folks that might have some light to shed.

417
00:42:13,384 --> 00:42:18,247
And Libby, I know you sort of work in this space, if you have any light to shed.

418
00:42:18,307 --> 00:42:23,592
So it's really just more to sort of get the juices flowing and thinking about before we go too far.

419
00:42:25,107 --> 00:42:30,173
I do have a group and there may be some surrounding communities.

420
00:42:30,434 --> 00:42:32,656
I think you mentioned Arlington more recently.

421
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:32,737
Yep.

422
00:42:34,358 --> 00:42:40,686
I know Somerville is also another community that has done a new high school.

423
00:42:41,187 --> 00:42:41,367
Yep.

424
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:46,383
I think of Stoneham in the last few years, which is a little different.

425
00:42:46,443 --> 00:42:47,664
It's a town a lot smaller.

426
00:42:47,684 --> 00:42:57,492
I have a pretty good relationship with the procurement officer in Stoneham as well as Somerville.

427
00:42:57,732 --> 00:43:06,440
I can certainly reach out to some of the group and see how things worked with them.

428
00:43:06,740 --> 00:43:09,923
I'm going to just say this is similar to Bob, I don't have

429
00:43:10,792 --> 00:43:18,696
A lot of experience, you know, building a new school other than the community that I lived in, but that was on the different side of it.

430
00:43:19,436 --> 00:43:26,820
So, so this is something I can definitely I haven't I haven't done that yet, but I can certainly.

431
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:29,210
If you could, that would be great.

432
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:41,892
I think the other thing that would be helpful, Fiona, to start the wheels turning in a related way is to find out if they have copies of their procurements for their owner's project manager.

433
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:47,353
That's going to be our big thing is to get ready to issue that RFP.

434
00:43:47,393 --> 00:43:53,394
Because once the OPM gets on board, life for all the rest of us gets easier, hopefully.

435
00:43:53,494 --> 00:43:55,595
So I'm looking forward to that.

436
00:43:55,615 --> 00:43:56,415
That's going to be our hero.

437
00:43:57,115 --> 00:43:58,416
Yeah.

438
00:43:59,056 --> 00:44:07,000
The city does have templates or RFQs for OPM for designers.

439
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:16,724
We've done it for the library, we've done it for the police station, we've done it for the fire station, and we're doing it for the McGlynn and Andrews right now.

440
00:44:17,305 --> 00:44:20,286
We just hired an OPM.

441
00:44:20,766 --> 00:44:26,409
We definitely have some templates and some foundations.

442
00:44:27,782 --> 00:44:44,369
Yeah, and Fiona, I'm thinking that there's also some very school-specific things about building with MSBA that maybe your counterparts in those other communities could provide as well, because the MSBA's process is very prescriptive sort of at every step.

443
00:44:44,429 --> 00:44:50,552
So anything that they can tell us, because my goal, you know, my goal, whenever we're done with eligibility and they invite us

444
00:44:51,472 --> 00:45:00,455
to the next phase, which is hiring our OPM is like my goal is that the next day our RP goes out the door and we are moving right along.

445
00:45:01,676 --> 00:45:12,340
And so obviously we'll sort of convene a working group with you between now and then to sort of get that procurement ready to go and make sure that it has all of its moving parts.

446
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:18,522
But if you're talking to them anyway, maybe grabbing that stuff too from them would be really helpful.

447
00:45:20,361 --> 00:45:21,061
Okay, thank you.

448
00:45:21,682 --> 00:45:41,995
If I might I was on the committee for all of those opm hires um, and a couple of things that I have noted is that that is the right time and place to sort of set a tone for the city's goals And what's important to the city?

449
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:49,560
Um when we've hired different opms for the library versus the police versus the schools we had different

450
00:45:50,701 --> 00:45:54,044
or issues and goals in mind.

451
00:45:54,524 --> 00:45:59,668
And I like set aside the fact that I'm a sustainability director, I was a sustainability director and all that.

452
00:45:59,708 --> 00:46:02,430
So we were like, Oh, we want low green net energy school.

453
00:46:02,871 --> 00:46:06,153
But like, what are you thinking about with the library, right?

454
00:46:06,213 --> 00:46:13,459
Like the library director knew what her strengths and weaknesses were and looked for an OPM that could sort of

455
00:46:14,019 --> 00:46:22,827
fill in, be a good partner for her where she had these strengths and these weaknesses, they would have the other as opposed to be like together.

456
00:46:23,407 --> 00:46:27,111
It was actually interesting when we were coming to the final decision around that.

457
00:46:28,332 --> 00:46:39,282
When we were interviewing for the OPM for the HVAC work, it was interesting that I wondered if some of them

458
00:46:40,733 --> 00:46:44,116
were aware that there was a new school on our horizon.

459
00:46:44,936 --> 00:46:57,786
There was one firm that bid or that put in a proposal that clearly that they did was big new schools with real big, with MSBA experience heavy.

460
00:46:58,246 --> 00:47:05,171
And I kind of, I didn't ask them, I wondered though, were they, did they feel like they were, you know,

461
00:47:06,593 --> 00:47:09,776
being a preview for what for us to get used to them.

462
00:47:09,836 --> 00:47:14,320
It's this idea that maybe did a good job there, we would wanna hire them for the high school.

463
00:47:14,841 --> 00:47:17,903
But what- My assumption is yes, they were doing that.

464
00:47:17,923 --> 00:47:18,244
Right.

465
00:47:18,904 --> 00:47:30,495
Yeah, what I did notice is that some of them really spoke to their experience and abilities with MSBA, which is why I wondered because that project is not MSBA funded.

466
00:47:31,058 --> 00:47:31,318
Right.

467
00:47:32,879 --> 00:47:36,501
But some of them really seem to have a good understanding of that.

468
00:47:37,082 --> 00:47:52,911
I did work on when the city did the boilers at the high school, that project, not the boilers, we did a boiler project too, but it was the science labs that MSBA funded.

469
00:47:52,931 --> 00:47:53,972
Yeah.

470
00:47:54,632 --> 00:47:58,234
It was really important actually to have somebody who understood

471
00:47:59,175 --> 00:48:00,175
those details.

472
00:48:00,556 --> 00:48:01,636
Yeah.

473
00:48:02,096 --> 00:48:05,537
Simply because things would come up and we'd be like, can we do this?

474
00:48:05,697 --> 00:48:15,981
And they'd be like, while that might actually make sense if you were paying out of pocket, it doesn't because of these MSBA reasons or MSBA won't pay for that.

475
00:48:16,541 --> 00:48:20,362
And so that did shape some of what we did.

476
00:48:20,382 --> 00:48:20,442
And

477
00:48:23,422 --> 00:48:45,377
I, it seems like it would go without saying, but you want a project manager who is going to lead and drive the project to the sense that they're going to say, we need to meet, who's available to meet, this is the time, let's set this up, let's set up our meetings, you know, and then rally and be an advocate for the city, because I have watched

478
00:48:46,750 --> 00:48:54,036
OPMs just sit back and say, oh, the city should, this is the city's project, we're just here to help.

479
00:48:54,937 --> 00:48:58,559
And then you're like, you didn't tell us and you didn't warn us and we didn't know.

480
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:02,663
And I've seen other OPMs who were like, here's what you need to know.

481
00:49:03,103 --> 00:49:05,305
And we need to push back on this contractor.

482
00:49:05,885 --> 00:49:10,368
And we needed to argue with the architect over what's possible.

483
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:13,030
And so you need to,

484
00:49:14,011 --> 00:49:26,114
B, or at least call it out like, yeah, no, you can do another iteration, or have you looked at it this way versus that way, and be another set of eyes on it, and that's helpful to look at.

485
00:49:27,574 --> 00:49:40,437
I did think when we did the library and the police station that literally the fact that the staff person in the room besides the chief of police of the library was the sustainability director set a tone for them.

486
00:49:41,077 --> 00:49:43,098
I'm not saying I want to be in on those interviews.

487
00:49:43,698 --> 00:50:05,703
but it was set up front like this is green is important to us we value this and I think that it's important that the school department put forward like this is important like this is gonna be a net zero school right like what would it yeah and the school committee has already outlined that set of goals and objectives so um

488
00:50:07,503 --> 00:50:09,765
we're sort of on our way with that for sure.

489
00:50:09,845 --> 00:50:19,194
But yes, like making sure that sort of what we envision is well outlined is definitely sort of top of mind.

490
00:50:20,635 --> 00:50:20,916
Yeah.

491
00:50:22,197 --> 00:50:26,401
That you don't need your OPM telling you that that's a bad idea.

492
00:50:26,421 --> 00:50:26,501
Yeah.

493
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:31,221
I've had them say it, like.

494
00:50:31,341 --> 00:50:31,621
I know.

495
00:50:31,841 --> 00:50:34,922
No, I've worked for OPMs a lot.

496
00:50:34,942 --> 00:50:57,629
I obviously have a client, but the OPM kind of is between us and in a good way, you know, helping things along and you need to make sure that their vision aligns with our vision, City of Memphis vision, because oftentimes they're very experienced and they have been doing this for a long time and they kind of know how to do things or how they've done things, which makes they know how we want to do things in the future.

497
00:50:58,370 --> 00:50:58,550
Yeah.

498
00:51:03,868 --> 00:51:09,530
I don't know how you set your budget for a feasibility study, but I think going to the other cities.

499
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:11,951
I mean, I get this question all the time.

500
00:51:12,111 --> 00:51:14,891
Alicia, you did this plan or this kind of project.

501
00:51:15,331 --> 00:51:16,652
Can you tell me about it?

502
00:51:16,732 --> 00:51:18,072
What did these things cost?

503
00:51:18,472 --> 00:51:20,693
Can you give me the RFQs you used?

504
00:51:21,153 --> 00:51:23,835
you know, can you tell me what the bids were?

505
00:51:23,935 --> 00:51:29,580
Like, there's a lot of stuff that Fiona will know what is legally public record.

506
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:35,044
So it's fine for us to ask other communities for this information.

507
00:51:35,064 --> 00:51:36,425
Yeah, that's what I want to know.

508
00:51:36,485 --> 00:51:37,286
Is it okay to ask?

509
00:51:37,326 --> 00:51:38,767
Like, do you share?

510
00:51:38,807 --> 00:51:41,810
You do share that as long as it's the right documents, right?

511
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:42,310
Yes.

512
00:51:42,670 --> 00:51:43,111
So we can ask.

513
00:51:44,507 --> 00:51:45,328
Yes, often.

514
00:51:45,868 --> 00:51:46,489
Okay, cool.

515
00:51:46,509 --> 00:51:56,957
Yeah, and Alicia, the numbers I've been hearing are pretty consistent from multiple sources in terms of people familiar with Medford and this project.

516
00:51:58,058 --> 00:52:01,681
The numbers are not all over the map, so I think that's a good thing for us.

517
00:52:03,586 --> 00:52:06,429
And I think the mayor is hearing the same, so that is.

518
00:52:06,449 --> 00:52:10,273
And this is mostly the fees to cover OPM architect.

519
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:10,573
Yep.

520
00:52:10,633 --> 00:52:12,795
And mostly just like consultant fees.

521
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:13,216
Yep.

522
00:52:13,236 --> 00:52:13,316
Yeah.

523
00:52:20,236 --> 00:52:25,183
And, you know, ultimately, we will the city council have to take a vote with some very precise language, but.

524
00:52:26,304 --> 00:52:28,828
I don't think that's anything for this group to be worried about.

525
00:52:28,848 --> 00:52:34,375
I will like, work with to make sure the language that goes forward is compliant and sort of ready to go.

526
00:52:34,395 --> 00:52:34,455
But.

527
00:52:36,857 --> 00:52:40,319
Yeah, I think those were those were our two agenda items.

528
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:43,862
So thank you all for joining 655.

529
00:52:44,923 --> 00:52:45,743
We're done early.

530
00:52:45,843 --> 00:52:48,745
So hopefully, you can take your hour back.

531
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:58,612
And then Bob and Alicia, I will reach out to you separately about some of the things that we need from like planning and projection perspective.

532
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:02,735
It may be more Alicia than Bob, I'm not sure.

533
00:53:02,775 --> 00:53:05,482
I've just literally got the access like two hours ago.

534
00:53:05,542 --> 00:53:07,327
So we'll keep you posted.

535
00:53:08,115 --> 00:53:10,996
Jenny, I know I told you this, but I'll just share.

536
00:53:11,016 --> 00:53:20,240
The MAPCs are regional planning agency and they do population projections as part of what they do and for various purposes and ways.

537
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:31,785
I've actually already spoken to them and they just ask that we provide them with the exact language because sometimes the different words are nuanced and mean things.

538
00:53:32,285 --> 00:53:37,989
but they can help us develop some projections that they can put data behind.

539
00:53:38,530 --> 00:53:44,714
And it's not using up staff time that's so limited, but they have the bandwidth for that.

540
00:53:45,315 --> 00:53:45,535
Great.

541
00:53:46,196 --> 00:53:48,177
Okay.

542
00:53:48,938 --> 00:53:55,863
So if there are no other questions, is there a motion to adjourn?

543
00:53:55,883 --> 00:53:58,805
Motion to adjourn.

544
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:05,235
Motion to adjourn by Aaron, seconded by Libby.

545
00:54:05,956 --> 00:54:07,397
That's okay.

546
00:54:07,898 --> 00:54:09,960
And roll call.

547
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,781
Jenny Graham, yes.

548
00:54:11,922 --> 00:54:13,423
Mayor Longo Kern, absent.

549
00:54:13,764 --> 00:54:15,065
Libby Brown, yes.

550
00:54:16,206 --> 00:54:17,147
And Aaron Olopade.

551
00:54:17,167 --> 00:54:18,208
Yes.

552
00:54:19,129 --> 00:54:20,891
Three in the affirmative, one absent.

553
00:54:21,031 --> 00:54:21,912
The meeting is adjourned.

554
00:54:22,553 --> 00:54:23,213
Thank you.

555
00:54:23,233 --> 00:54:24,154
Thank you, everyone.
