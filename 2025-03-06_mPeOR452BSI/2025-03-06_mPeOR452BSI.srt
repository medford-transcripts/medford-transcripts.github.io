1
00:00:00,051 --> 00:00:05,837
[SPEAKER_21]: continued public hearing for the Salem Street Corridor zoning amendments.

2
00:00:06,958 --> 00:00:09,640
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is a continued public hearing.

3
00:00:10,241 --> 00:00:20,311
[SPEAKER_21]: We last discussed when the public hearing was opened at the January 22nd, 2025 Community Development Board meeting, which was continued to February 5th.

4
00:00:21,652 --> 00:00:38,645
[SPEAKER_21]: At the February 5th meeting, we continued without discussion to this evening's meeting, March 5th, primarily in order to allow for more public outreach and to hold a question and answer meeting at the Roberts Elementary School, which was held on February 10th, 2025.

5
00:00:42,318 --> 00:00:50,262
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm going to hand it off to the staff, ask if they have any introductory comments, we're then going to pass it on to Innes associates.

6
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:58,787
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we will move into board questions and comments, and then we will open the public comment period.

7
00:01:00,064 --> 00:01:05,450
[SPEAKER_21]: I did just receive a question for where the raise hand function is.

8
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:11,178
[SPEAKER_21]: If you want to get ahead of the line, feel free to raise your hand.

9
00:01:11,198 --> 00:01:13,461
[SPEAKER_21]: I need to reorient myself with where it is.

10
00:01:16,842 --> 00:01:17,603
[SPEAKER_17]: It's under React.

11
00:01:18,203 --> 00:01:18,643
[SPEAKER_21]: React.

12
00:01:19,444 --> 00:01:28,670
[SPEAKER_21]: So if you click on the React button, which is a heart, not the arrow next to React, but the React button itself, you can raise your hand.

13
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,471
[SPEAKER_21]: And I already see some hands going up.

14
00:01:32,252 --> 00:01:44,541
[SPEAKER_21]: If you have questions in terms of technology, please feel free to message Danielle or Alicia, and I'll do my best to redirect you all to them.

15
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:50,992
[SPEAKER_21]: But for now, we are going to hear some introductory comments from Danielle or Alicia.

16
00:01:51,012 --> 00:01:58,895
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Chair, I don't have anything.

17
00:01:58,915 --> 00:02:02,256
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know if Dr. Hunt has anything that you'd like to say.

18
00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:05,438
[SPEAKER_22]: I think we should move on to the consultant.

19
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,398
[SPEAKER_22]: It's going to be a long night.

20
00:02:07,244 --> 00:02:07,504
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

21
00:02:08,004 --> 00:02:20,710
[SPEAKER_21]: And I read, I read some pretty good recaps of the meeting from some members of the public and I'm really excited to hear from Innocent Associates in terms of what comments have been incorporated.

22
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,031
[SPEAKER_21]: So we have Emily and Paola.

23
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:27,294
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, everyone.

24
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:28,695
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

25
00:02:29,055 --> 00:02:33,599
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Emily Ennis from Innes Associates, and I will be making tonight's presentation.

26
00:02:34,179 --> 00:02:36,421
[SPEAKER_13]: With your permission, I will share my screen.

27
00:02:38,966 --> 00:02:57,584
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you and what we plan to do is give an update for you of what we heard of the timeline partially and then what we heard at the meeting and the changes that we made in response to what we heard of the meeting because we have made some changes.

28
00:02:58,986 --> 00:03:09,693
[SPEAKER_13]: So, we'll talk a little bit about those components, and then we can also go if we need to, to the draft zoning itself, but we have summarized the changes on the slide.

29
00:03:10,494 --> 00:03:14,056
[SPEAKER_13]: So, this is a timeline to date, ending up with today, March 5th.

30
00:03:14,997 --> 00:03:21,342
[SPEAKER_13]: We had started working with a workshop with the Planning and Permitting Committee last July.

31
00:03:22,643 --> 00:03:29,914
[SPEAKER_13]: did sort of Mystic Avenue and Salem Street in parallel and then move to finishing up Mystic Avenue, moving forward with Salem Street.

32
00:03:30,274 --> 00:03:36,263
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the key things here is the fact that we have held the community listening session on February 10th.

33
00:03:37,264 --> 00:03:39,025
[SPEAKER_13]: You can also see that here.

34
00:03:39,906 --> 00:03:44,009
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we are today again for March 5th, and we are continuing.

35
00:03:44,049 --> 00:03:47,451
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the rest of the timeline just to keep you all updated.

36
00:03:48,011 --> 00:03:53,054
[SPEAKER_13]: We have been working on the neighborhood and urban residential components.

37
00:03:53,074 --> 00:04:03,381
[SPEAKER_13]: Those will be coming your way, but before they do, we will have a listening session for the residential, and that's going to be either March, as far as we know now, either March 20th or 27th.

38
00:04:05,542 --> 00:04:16,786
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll also be doing a squares and Boston Avenue community listening session because we're starting to talk about the commercial areas and that right now again is either going to be April 10th or April 29th.

39
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:19,627
[SPEAKER_13]: So just to quickly give you an update of what's coming.

40
00:04:20,307 --> 00:04:26,169
[SPEAKER_13]: But the key thing today is reporting back to you about the listening session and those changes.

41
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:28,310
[SPEAKER_13]: So the listening session was one room.

42
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:45,878
[SPEAKER_13]: But broken into basically two activities at the front of the cafetorium, we held a presentation, and people could ask questions and have myself, Council President Bears,

43
00:04:47,899 --> 00:04:50,001
[SPEAKER_13]: and Director Hunt answer questions.

44
00:04:50,521 --> 00:05:01,269
[SPEAKER_13]: At the back of the room, Danielle and my colleague, Pablo Ramos-Martinez, had these maps, two of these maps here and two other boards that I'll show you.

45
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:07,074
[SPEAKER_13]: And they were able to work one-on-one with people who had questions maybe about specific properties.

46
00:05:07,194 --> 00:05:14,279
[SPEAKER_13]: So the map showed the current zoning up here at the top and then our then proposed zoning.

47
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:16,501
[SPEAKER_13]: As I said, there have been some changes.

48
00:05:17,161 --> 00:05:23,085
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can see some of the stickies that people put on with their questions or their thoughts about the area.

49
00:05:24,826 --> 00:05:26,367
[SPEAKER_13]: We also had the use tables up.

50
00:05:26,527 --> 00:05:29,949
[SPEAKER_13]: So these were the proposed uses at the time of the meeting.

51
00:05:30,009 --> 00:05:32,411
[SPEAKER_13]: We have made some adjustments based on what we heard.

52
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:41,776
[SPEAKER_13]: And we asked people to mark off if they thought the uses were appropriate or not appropriate by district or for the neighborhood as a whole.

53
00:05:42,376 --> 00:05:44,618
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can see a lot of stickies here.

54
00:05:44,838 --> 00:05:49,620
[SPEAKER_13]: We captured those as no's.

55
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:55,924
[SPEAKER_13]: There were quite a few uses that people did not feel were appropriate for the area, so we took that into consideration as well.

56
00:05:56,644 --> 00:06:11,672
[SPEAKER_13]: And I believe we have just transmitted, it takes a while to write all of these up in a memo format, but I believe we've just transmitted that to Director Hunt today so that we have the full write up in there, but this is a useful summary.

57
00:06:12,593 --> 00:06:17,235
[SPEAKER_13]: So this was the proposal we presented to you at our last meeting together.

58
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,196
[SPEAKER_13]: You can see the

59
00:06:19,236 --> 00:06:29,444
[SPEAKER_13]: mixed-use 1 in blue, the mixed-use 2 in red, the commercial, we have just one property that's marked commercial, and we have the multi-unit residential.

60
00:06:29,464 --> 00:06:36,810
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're making changes to this based on what we heard at the meeting, and this is the rough outline of the changes.

61
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:47,638
[SPEAKER_13]: We're shifting a few things around, primarily, and the most important, and I do have a clean version of this map, which I'll show you, but I want to call out so you can see exactly what the changes are.

62
00:06:48,038 --> 00:07:08,868
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the most important is this area around Park Street which we had originally discussed as being mix two is now at mix one and that has implications for the number of stories and the amount, the number of stories as a base but also the number of stories in terms of incentive zoning so

63
00:07:09,408 --> 00:07:24,648
[SPEAKER_13]: mixed use to was a four story base maximum base with an additional two stories available from the incentive zoning, just as a reminder for those who might not have been at the first meeting or at the listening session.

64
00:07:25,108 --> 00:07:30,973
[SPEAKER_13]: The incentive zoning allows additional height, but only in return for public benefits from the developer.

65
00:07:31,694 --> 00:07:40,302
[SPEAKER_13]: By changing this to a mix one, we drop down to a three story base zone with an incentive zoning of four stories.

66
00:07:40,462 --> 00:07:45,726
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've essentially knocked one story off the base and two stories off the incentive.

67
00:07:47,588 --> 00:07:54,052
[SPEAKER_13]: The other things that we did were just sort of rationalize some of the other parcels we went in throughout this process.

68
00:07:54,092 --> 00:08:02,578
[SPEAKER_13]: We've tried to listen to people and understand, you know, the ground conditions as well as the mapping analyses that we've done.

69
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:11,260
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've moved some of these, like the parcels here that were targeted as multi unit residential, those have actually been moved out of the district at the moment.

70
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:19,743
[SPEAKER_13]: This is in part in response to the work we've been doing on the neighborhoods and throughout the city and I'll talk a little bit more about that later.

71
00:08:20,323 --> 00:08:33,836
[SPEAKER_13]: and then we just had a closer look at some things that were going on on these parcels here, moved this one from MX2 into MR, which is the multifamily residential, and moved this multifamily residential into MX2.

72
00:08:34,276 --> 00:08:46,067
[SPEAKER_13]: So the new map looks like this, and you can see it's pretty consistently mixed-use one up along the corridor itself with a few parcels behind, also being allowed to be mixed-use one

73
00:08:47,107 --> 00:08:59,970
[SPEAKER_13]: Mixed-use 2 is concentrated up at the top, sort of planned northeast, as we call it, with the one commercial remaining, and then the MR district remaining here.

74
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:03,691
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's what the impact of the map changes looks like.

75
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:06,272
[SPEAKER_13]: Can you go back to the previous slide real quick?

76
00:09:06,732 --> 00:09:07,452
[SPEAKER_13]: Sure, absolutely.

77
00:09:07,472 --> 00:09:10,113
[SPEAKER_13]: And you want to see here as well.

78
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:12,573
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is the original.

79
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:14,974
[SPEAKER_13]: These are calling out the individual changes.

80
00:09:16,727 --> 00:09:30,894
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, and these are so we changed a few these dark blues are a few changing from the multifamily residential to mix 1 in some cases, for example, it's already there's 1 parcel just as an example that already has apartments on it.

81
00:09:31,354 --> 00:09:32,915
[SPEAKER_13]: So, it didn't make sense to leave in the 1.

82
00:09:33,776 --> 00:09:36,797
[SPEAKER_13]: So, again, we took a parcel by parcel view of that.

83
00:09:38,358 --> 00:09:40,679
[SPEAKER_13]: So then again, you can see the changes that CMR.

84
00:09:40,859 --> 00:09:42,160
[SPEAKER_13]: So sort of cleaned.

85
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:47,444
[SPEAKER_13]: that up so that stays the MR there and then again the mix too.

86
00:09:48,205 --> 00:10:10,543
[SPEAKER_25]: Emily, Madam Chair if I may, these changes of the so what we are going to do in this change will appear later is that the multi-residential that was for three to six units now goes down to one to three and that is why instead of having that transition we add some more

87
00:10:12,768 --> 00:10:23,677
[SPEAKER_25]: We add this new from MR to mixed use one, those blue parcels that you saw before, which currently are apartment one.

88
00:10:24,437 --> 00:10:27,139
[SPEAKER_25]: They currently are multi-family in any case.

89
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,681
[SPEAKER_25]: So I just wanted to make that sure.

90
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:36,307
[SPEAKER_25]: We haven't placed any single family currently parcel that is in single family district.

91
00:10:37,013 --> 00:10:37,934
[SPEAKER_25]: two makes one.

92
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:44,020
[SPEAKER_25]: These are all apartment one that are currently in apartment one.

93
00:10:44,901 --> 00:10:46,202
[SPEAKER_25]: I just wanted to clarify that.

94
00:10:46,622 --> 00:10:46,862
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

95
00:10:50,628 --> 00:11:09,268
[SPEAKER_13]: So the, the, that's, that's the big map change I think the the next thing that happens is the recommendations from city staff so again for people who may be joining this for the first time and haven't known the process, the city council sent a draft to the CD board for their review.

96
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:23,785
[SPEAKER_13]: At the January 22 meeting we presented recommendations from city staff that would change or offer amendments to the original draft I just want to quickly go over those.

97
00:11:24,326 --> 00:11:30,653
[SPEAKER_13]: Since then we have another set of recommendations based primarily on what we heard and the implications of what we heard.

98
00:11:31,213 --> 00:11:34,154
[SPEAKER_13]: at the public meeting, so I'm going to present those as well.

99
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:41,176
[SPEAKER_13]: But just as a reminder, the first one is we wanted to clarify the intent of the development incentive bonuses.

100
00:11:41,256 --> 00:11:50,338
[SPEAKER_13]: There was some concern that a developer could stack all the bonuses on top of each other and achieve a height higher than what is allowed by the zoning.

101
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:54,580
[SPEAKER_13]: We wanted to clarify that you can only go up to that maximum height.

102
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,220
[SPEAKER_13]: So in the MX-1,

103
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,966
[SPEAKER_13]: You get three stories, you can only go up one more story.

104
00:12:01,107 --> 00:12:05,073
[SPEAKER_13]: In the MX2, you get four stories, you can only go up two more stories.

105
00:12:05,233 --> 00:12:09,399
[SPEAKER_13]: So just to clarify that you can only go up to that maximum height.

106
00:12:10,576 --> 00:12:18,160
[SPEAKER_13]: I should also say here that the incentive bonus is only allowed for those parcels that directly front onto Salem Street.

107
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:27,684
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you are a parcel, say, in the MX-1 or in the MX-2 that does not front on Salem Street, the incentive bonus is not achievable.

108
00:12:27,744 --> 00:12:28,585
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not allowable.

109
00:12:29,245 --> 00:12:34,628
[SPEAKER_13]: We added definitions for clinic, hospital, neighborhood, medical office, and medical office.

110
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,629
[SPEAKER_13]: The first two we pointed to state law.

111
00:12:37,109 --> 00:12:37,909
[SPEAKER_13]: The second one we

112
00:12:40,550 --> 00:12:50,093
[SPEAKER_13]: changed it based on controls that governed the number of square feet, gross floor area, and no more than five employees.

113
00:12:50,133 --> 00:12:52,774
[SPEAKER_13]: We've made an additional change since then, which I'll show you.

114
00:12:53,174 --> 00:12:56,975
[SPEAKER_13]: And then medical office obviously is not restricted by those requirements.

115
00:12:58,535 --> 00:13:07,358
[SPEAKER_13]: In the January 2022, we had added neighborhood medical office as a yes and medical office as a special permit from yourselves.

116
00:13:08,368 --> 00:13:20,276
[SPEAKER_13]: And then we had in January 22, we had also added some height step back requirements to help protect the residential district.

117
00:13:20,316 --> 00:13:32,665
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're requiring that the height be stepped back further from the residential district and allowing a step back waiver because at the time we were talking about a front step back and rear or side step backs.

118
00:13:34,394 --> 00:13:42,940
[SPEAKER_13]: We had made, there was a typo in, I think, the earlier draft that had some of the adult use marijuana as a CDB special permit.

119
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:47,403
[SPEAKER_13]: We've changed that to no on January 22nd recommendations.

120
00:13:48,985 --> 00:13:52,427
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's the end of the January 22nd recommendations.

121
00:13:52,467 --> 00:13:53,848
[SPEAKER_13]: So you've seen these before.

122
00:13:54,248 --> 00:13:57,171
[SPEAKER_13]: Now I want to show you what we've changed since the public meeting.

123
00:13:57,751 --> 00:14:13,315
[SPEAKER_13]: So the first change is we are no longer allowing medical office that is the unrestricted by, by the number of square feet or the number of employees that's not being allowed anywhere in the Salem street.

124
00:14:14,215 --> 00:14:14,716
[SPEAKER_13]: district.

125
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:18,879
[SPEAKER_13]: We are not allowing neighborhood medical in mix one.

126
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:28,446
[SPEAKER_13]: So that area around Park Street, for example, that is that was mixed to that neighborhood medical could have been in, it's now mix one neighborhood medical is not allowed there.

127
00:14:28,946 --> 00:14:35,691
[SPEAKER_13]: And we are allowing it as special permit by the CD board and mix two and commercial so that that upper end

128
00:14:36,892 --> 00:14:44,656
[SPEAKER_13]: in the RAD, and that is because we heard loud and clear from the community members who were present at the meeting.

129
00:14:45,157 --> 00:14:57,665
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a strong voice against having medical, certainly having medical around the school area and the Park Street area, but also some concern about having it at all.

130
00:14:57,705 --> 00:15:00,827
[SPEAKER_13]: We wanted to balance it with people who did express

131
00:15:02,388 --> 00:15:21,609
[SPEAKER_13]: There were a few that expressed an interest in having some medical in the area and also where the MX2 district is, where it's got access from parts of the city that don't have to go through Salem Street, allowing that, but allowing that with the restrictions on it and also the restriction of a special permit.

132
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:36,490
[SPEAKER_13]: It's important that people be able to access their dentists or physicians, but we wanted to make sure that it was not creating an impact on the neighborhood in terms of traffic and people coming in and out which is I think part of the concern.

133
00:15:38,345 --> 00:16:02,886
[SPEAKER_13]: On the table of use regulations, so the multi-unit residential subjects district, so we have modified this to match in for anybody who has, who's on this call, who's been following the residential discussion, we have a residential district called NR3, which is, as Paola said, it's restricted to three dwelling units, although there's a historic conversion in there.

134
00:16:03,887 --> 00:16:11,429
[SPEAKER_13]: done is we've lined up the multi-unit residential subdistrict here to eventually be replaced by NR3.

135
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:18,311
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the city councilors are well aware that at the end of this process, we're going to have to come back and sort of right size a couple of things.

136
00:16:19,011 --> 00:16:21,032
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's because we're doing it geographically.

137
00:16:21,552 --> 00:16:31,295
[SPEAKER_13]: So what we're trying to do is set up the MR to eventually become the NR3, which is when we look at the maps, it's fairly close to what's on the ground now.

138
00:16:31,855 --> 00:16:42,402
[SPEAKER_13]: So, all of these changes are to make sure that the table of use regulations for the multi-unit residential subdistrict are consistent with the NR3 subdistrict.

139
00:16:42,462 --> 00:16:44,763
[SPEAKER_13]: And at the end of the process, we'll just combine the two.

140
00:16:46,124 --> 00:16:47,565
[SPEAKER_13]: So, those are the tweaks.

141
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:52,748
[SPEAKER_13]: The key is to make sure that it is the primarily residential district that it is now.

142
00:16:52,848 --> 00:16:54,770
[SPEAKER_13]: So, we've tried to be very careful about that.

143
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,131
[SPEAKER_13]: The next thing is for MX1, MX2, and commercial.

144
00:17:00,171 --> 00:17:02,572
[SPEAKER_13]: We have some additional use modifications.

145
00:17:03,252 --> 00:17:09,414
[SPEAKER_13]: We heard from quite a few people in the public meeting that they did not want a hotel in the area, which is currently allowed.

146
00:17:10,754 --> 00:17:14,556
[SPEAKER_13]: We removed the brewery or taproom for MX1.

147
00:17:14,596 --> 00:17:18,797
[SPEAKER_13]: We think that's much more appropriate where MX2 is now as a use.

148
00:17:20,378 --> 00:17:29,932
[SPEAKER_13]: We have created the option for taking the option for a parking area or garage that's accessory to a principal use, but it's not necessarily on the same lot.

149
00:17:30,513 --> 00:17:34,298
[SPEAKER_13]: And that is by special permit from yourselves and MX1 and MX2.

150
00:17:36,581 --> 00:17:44,904
[SPEAKER_13]: parking area or garage accessory to a principal use on the same lot as a non-conforming principal use, also special permit for MX-1 and MX-2.

151
00:17:45,584 --> 00:17:51,326
[SPEAKER_13]: We've removed distillery or winery from both, mostly because of the square footage requirements.

152
00:17:51,366 --> 00:17:53,686
[SPEAKER_13]: The parcels in that area are quite small.

153
00:17:54,266 --> 00:18:00,008
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a use that does not seem practicable in either of those.

154
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:04,430
[SPEAKER_13]: We've clarified home occupation as by special permit in MX-1 and MX-2.

155
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:08,131
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the end of the uses.

156
00:18:08,411 --> 00:18:13,512
[SPEAKER_13]: In terms of the dimensional requirements for the multi-unit residential sub-district, same thing.

157
00:18:13,572 --> 00:18:15,672
[SPEAKER_13]: We're lining those up with the NR3.

158
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:19,493
[SPEAKER_13]: Minimum height, two stories.

159
00:18:19,713 --> 00:18:25,214
[SPEAKER_13]: Maximum height is because they don't have the buildings on Salem Street.

160
00:18:26,374 --> 00:18:34,636
[SPEAKER_13]: Mixed one does not have the incentive zoning that, sorry, multi-unit residential doesn't have the incentive zoning that mix one and mix two do.

161
00:18:35,397 --> 00:18:37,960
[SPEAKER_13]: and then the rest of that is the same.

162
00:18:38,761 --> 00:18:49,817
[SPEAKER_13]: Same thing for setbacks, front 10, rear 15, side 5 feet to some to 10 feet, stormwater and landscaping, all of these are consistent with the NR3 to be.

163
00:18:53,058 --> 00:19:04,804
[SPEAKER_13]: For MX1, MX2 and commercial, we did hear from people that wanted to make sure that the buildings weren't impinging on the adjacent residential districts.

164
00:19:04,864 --> 00:19:08,946
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have deleted the step back requirement for MX1.

165
00:19:09,306 --> 00:19:11,107
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's step back from the street.

166
00:19:11,427 --> 00:19:14,208
[SPEAKER_13]: The idea was the step back above the third floor.

167
00:19:14,248 --> 00:19:19,051
[SPEAKER_13]: So you would start going up straight and then above the third floor, you'd step it back to go up further.

168
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,212
[SPEAKER_13]: But now MX1 is only four floors.

169
00:19:21,752 --> 00:19:30,721
[SPEAKER_13]: Doesn't make sense to have a step back for a single floor and also we want to preserve the ability to step back if necessary from the other side.

170
00:19:31,241 --> 00:19:37,347
[SPEAKER_13]: We created a setback of 10 feet in MX1, MX2 and commercial for the rear lot line.

171
00:19:37,367 --> 00:19:39,389
[SPEAKER_13]: We heard that was very important for people.

172
00:19:40,571 --> 00:19:47,021
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, we also reduce the neighborhood residential 3, the sub district for the multi unit residential.

173
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:51,208
[SPEAKER_13]: We've reduced it down to 1 to 3 units within the area rather than 3 to 6.

174
00:19:53,488 --> 00:19:57,689
[SPEAKER_13]: And the side and the rear setbacks, we just clarified the language.

175
00:19:57,749 --> 00:20:02,791
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a concern at the public meeting about the fence that we had in there.

176
00:20:04,091 --> 00:20:06,311
[SPEAKER_13]: We talked about it.

177
00:20:07,112 --> 00:20:15,994
[SPEAKER_13]: The way the language was structured, it made it look like a fence only required a five foot setback as opposed to being halfway through the 10 foot setback.

178
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:17,895
[SPEAKER_13]: We thought it was just too confusing.

179
00:20:17,975 --> 00:20:19,415
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're requiring that

180
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:27,899
[SPEAKER_13]: landscape buffer of at least 10 feet wide if a proposed development is adjacent to existing lot with a residential use of fewer than 5 units.

181
00:20:28,439 --> 00:20:36,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, that's to create a nicer buffer between anything that could someday be built along Salem Street and the adjacent neighborhoods.

182
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:41,365
[SPEAKER_13]: And then finally, are there proposed changes to amend the map that I showed earlier?

183
00:20:42,344 --> 00:20:44,825
[SPEAKER_13]: So that is it for the changes.

184
00:20:45,005 --> 00:20:51,829
[SPEAKER_13]: I think the listening to people's concerns at the public listening session was very helpful to us.

185
00:20:52,649 --> 00:21:02,975
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that we've been able to address most of what we heard, but I'm delighted to take any questions from the board and obviously listen to the public comment.

186
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:06,157
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

187
00:21:06,277 --> 00:21:06,897
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Emily.

188
00:21:10,529 --> 00:21:16,134
[SPEAKER_21]: So now we are going to have the board ask questions, comments.

189
00:21:19,858 --> 00:21:25,563
[SPEAKER_21]: Emily and Paolo will respond, hopefully, or be able to respond in some way.

190
00:21:26,364 --> 00:21:30,888
[SPEAKER_21]: And then we'll open the public hearing just to keep everyone updated on our plans for this evening.

191
00:21:32,229 --> 00:21:35,292
[SPEAKER_21]: So fellow board members, what do we think?

192
00:21:38,522 --> 00:21:42,905
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm impressed with the changes that were made.

193
00:21:42,925 --> 00:21:46,026
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that they reflect what we heard on the 22nd.

194
00:21:49,348 --> 00:21:51,890
[SPEAKER_21]: I think you made some of the changes in a very strategic way.

195
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:58,153
[SPEAKER_21]: We heard a lot of comments about uses that were not appropriate in school areas.

196
00:21:58,173 --> 00:22:02,535
[SPEAKER_21]: I like how those were addressed.

197
00:22:05,464 --> 00:22:13,409
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and I appreciate the kind of block by block, parcel by parcel approach and the changes made there.

198
00:22:13,549 --> 00:22:17,812
[SPEAKER_21]: So interested hearing from the board and members of the public eventually.

199
00:22:21,959 --> 00:22:24,321
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I echo Emily's reaction.

200
00:22:24,461 --> 00:22:29,786
[SPEAKER_19]: I do like many of the changes 1 set of feedback that I remember hearing and.

201
00:22:30,787 --> 00:22:36,091
[SPEAKER_19]: Agreeing with large parts of it is do we have an update to the incentive zoning?

202
00:22:36,352 --> 00:22:37,853
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, there was discussion of.

203
00:22:39,517 --> 00:22:50,124
[SPEAKER_19]: Kind of reweighing some of those values so that we didn't end up with, you know, a bunch of fountains and so that we really emphasized the key priorities like affordable housing.

204
00:22:50,684 --> 00:22:55,288
[SPEAKER_19]: Can you share any updates on that list of tables and values?

205
00:22:55,588 --> 00:22:55,848
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

206
00:22:57,733 --> 00:23:02,215
[SPEAKER_13]: With your permission, Madam Chair, I'm just pulling it up so I have it in front of me.

207
00:23:04,576 --> 00:23:06,057
[SPEAKER_13]: And the answer is yes.

208
00:23:06,617 --> 00:23:12,580
[SPEAKER_13]: So we clarified the incentives for the affordability remained unchanged.

209
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:16,262
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have the option of deeper affordability or more affordable units.

210
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:22,364
[SPEAKER_13]: Or again, the max would be two additional stories.

211
00:23:24,045 --> 00:23:27,769
[SPEAKER_13]: MX2, so there won't be a whole lot of change there.

212
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:42,064
[SPEAKER_13]: For the community amenities, we had clarified that I think there was some confusion that a fountain was kind of an easy thing to do.

213
00:23:42,284 --> 00:23:47,189
[SPEAKER_13]: We clarified that also meant the maintenance and repair for the life of the associated building.

214
00:23:47,889 --> 00:23:57,874
[SPEAKER_13]: So, in other words, it's not just build a fountain, you have to, you have to provide the water for it, you have to keep it in good repair, there's nothing worse than a fountain that has just been let go.

215
00:23:58,515 --> 00:24:13,042
[SPEAKER_13]: So that we've clarified that we are certainly open to some additional options, and we've made it clear, clearer that the seeding I think people had from from some of the comments that I saw.

216
00:24:13,602 --> 00:24:20,385
[SPEAKER_13]: people assume that seating meant like a single bench, and we clarified that there was a square footage requirement.

217
00:24:20,785 --> 00:24:27,167
[SPEAKER_13]: We did have, I think, one person talk about making that an even larger requirement.

218
00:24:27,227 --> 00:24:39,212
[SPEAKER_13]: We're happy to look at that more if we get more feedback on that, but we were really focused on the uses and the map changes as being the biggest things we wanted to make sure we got done.

219
00:24:41,193 --> 00:24:48,716
[SPEAKER_21]: And Ari, as part of our recommendation, we may be able to recommend kind of further analysis of that menu coming out of this meeting.

220
00:24:49,456 --> 00:24:49,716
[SPEAKER_19]: Great.

221
00:24:50,136 --> 00:24:53,137
[SPEAKER_19]: I think I will probably ask for that near the end.

222
00:24:53,738 --> 00:24:53,938
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

223
00:24:54,258 --> 00:24:54,818
[SPEAKER_19]: But thank you.

224
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:00,540
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter, Adam, Annie.

225
00:25:02,421 --> 00:25:06,482
[SPEAKER_17]: I would also like to kind of echo what Emily and Ari said.

226
00:25:06,542 --> 00:25:07,943
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this is really

227
00:25:08,702 --> 00:25:11,583
[SPEAKER_17]: does reflect what we saw on 22nd and the concerns there.

228
00:25:11,623 --> 00:25:13,104
[SPEAKER_17]: Particularly, I appreciate it.

229
00:25:13,124 --> 00:25:28,230
[SPEAKER_17]: I remember hearing a lot about the area on Park Street and how people were concerned that that was kind of going too dense, and particularly around the uses that were allowable in the mix too.

230
00:25:29,030 --> 00:25:36,233
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think this did a great job of addressing that by keeping some of the density in the mix one, but also then adjusting the uses

231
00:25:38,483 --> 00:25:41,326
[SPEAKER_17]: to adjust what would be allowable there.

232
00:25:42,967 --> 00:25:43,487
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you.

233
00:25:47,191 --> 00:25:48,932
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm looking through my notes from last meeting.

234
00:25:51,314 --> 00:25:59,842
[SPEAKER_21]: Jane, a member of the public, brought up a bunch of different uses, breweries, methadone clinics, wine liquor store, rehabilitation clinics.

235
00:26:00,782 --> 00:26:02,304
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel like those have been addressed.

236
00:26:06,493 --> 00:26:13,827
[SPEAKER_21]: I like what you guys are doing with the parking garages, that might help with some of the parking concerns that people like Ralph brought up.

237
00:26:39,376 --> 00:26:50,299
[SPEAKER_21]: Sounds like there's a more reasonable approach to step backs, especially if it's just going to be one extra floor.

238
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:51,660
[SPEAKER_21]: There's no need for a step back.

239
00:26:54,481 --> 00:26:56,461
[SPEAKER_21]: John was somebody that brought that up last time.

240
00:26:56,481 --> 00:27:06,044
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, there's a couple.

241
00:27:06,787 --> 00:27:08,649
[SPEAKER_21]: couple comments that stood out to me from last time.

242
00:27:11,192 --> 00:27:17,019
[SPEAKER_21]: If we don't have any further comments or questions from the board, I would love to open it up to the public.

243
00:27:29,121 --> 00:27:31,623
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm now going to open the public comment period.

244
00:27:32,184 --> 00:27:35,066
[SPEAKER_21]: Those who wish to provide comments can use the raise hand function.

245
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:41,411
[SPEAKER_21]: And as mentioned earlier, if you're in Zoom, there is a react button.

246
00:27:41,991 --> 00:27:44,173
[SPEAKER_21]: Click right on it, and you should be able to raise your hand.

247
00:27:45,574 --> 00:27:50,318
[SPEAKER_21]: If you're having technical difficulties, please message Danielle or Alicia in the chat.

248
00:27:51,118 --> 00:27:54,700
[SPEAKER_21]: You can also send an email to OCD at medford-ma.gov.

249
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,502
[SPEAKER_21]: Before providing your comments, please state your name and address for the record.

250
00:27:59,522 --> 00:28:09,066
[SPEAKER_21]: A reminder to all meeting participants, please refrain from using the chat function to message any comments to city staff or board members, as that's not part of the public record.

251
00:28:10,226 --> 00:28:14,908
[SPEAKER_21]: However, if you do have audio or technical difficulties, you can message staff for assistance.

252
00:28:16,369 --> 00:28:19,190
[SPEAKER_21]: So, no comments about the topic via chat, but

253
00:28:19,917 --> 00:28:25,285
[SPEAKER_21]: you know, questions about Zoom or other technical issues, feel free to send those through chat to Alicia and Danielle.

254
00:28:26,387 --> 00:28:30,132
[SPEAKER_21]: As with before, we're going to give each participant two minutes to speak.

255
00:28:31,274 --> 00:28:33,237
[SPEAKER_21]: Each participant will have one opportunity to speak.

256
00:28:34,082 --> 00:28:40,305
[SPEAKER_21]: I do also want to say that any emails that are sent in to the Community Development Board are shared with the board in advance.

257
00:28:41,045 --> 00:28:51,250
[SPEAKER_21]: We review all of those, and if you feel that you're not able to convey your full comment in the two minutes provided, please, please, please email us.

258
00:28:52,091 --> 00:28:55,352
[SPEAKER_21]: We review every note and really appreciate the

259
00:28:58,138 --> 00:29:02,583
[SPEAKER_21]: the effort and the consistency that we've seen from the community to make sure that we get this right.

260
00:29:06,267 --> 00:29:10,952
[SPEAKER_21]: What's coming out of this meeting from the Community Development Board is recommendations for the City Council.

261
00:29:11,953 --> 00:29:20,362
[SPEAKER_21]: So the Community Development Board can kind of be, as we should, an advocate for the public.

262
00:29:21,573 --> 00:29:29,098
[SPEAKER_21]: for any additional process or steps or anything that needs to happen related to this process, so please keep that in mind.

263
00:29:29,118 --> 00:29:43,047
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, we're going to do our best to advocate and create conditions that drive action, but if you have specific actions that you would like to see, please make sure to call those out.

264
00:29:44,428 --> 00:29:45,929
[SPEAKER_21]: It's very easy to say what you don't want.

265
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:53,054
[SPEAKER_21]: Sometimes it's hard to vocalize what you do want, but that's the most valuable input for us right now, what you do want.

266
00:29:54,935 --> 00:29:57,377
[SPEAKER_21]: Alicia is going to manage the public comment queue.

267
00:29:58,778 --> 00:30:01,460
[SPEAKER_21]: Alicia, I know we've received some comments.

268
00:30:02,441 --> 00:30:04,262
[SPEAKER_21]: Did you want to offer a high-level summary of those?

269
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:14,428
[SPEAKER_22]: Can we just give that at the end of the thing?

270
00:30:14,968 --> 00:30:18,169
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I see we have some people eager to speak, and I'm eager to hear from you.

271
00:30:19,289 --> 00:30:24,910
[SPEAKER_21]: So I believe David Zapner is up first.

272
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,611
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

273
00:30:28,071 --> 00:30:29,951
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

274
00:30:29,971 --> 00:30:33,692
[SPEAKER_21]: And Alicia or Danielle will be managing a timer.

275
00:30:35,456 --> 00:30:36,136
[SPEAKER_33]: Hello, everybody.

276
00:30:36,156 --> 00:30:37,536
[SPEAKER_33]: I'm David Zabner.

277
00:30:37,616 --> 00:30:40,217
[SPEAKER_33]: I live at 107 Bowdoin Street here in Medford.

278
00:30:40,237 --> 00:30:45,778
[SPEAKER_33]: I guess I'll say that I'm very excited for these changes.

279
00:30:45,798 --> 00:30:48,239
[SPEAKER_33]: I think it's really important that we rezone the city.

280
00:30:48,259 --> 00:30:53,880
[SPEAKER_33]: I think this is a really good step towards the progress we need to see in the city.

281
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,841
[SPEAKER_33]: Housing values are too high.

282
00:30:58,341 --> 00:31:03,182
[SPEAKER_33]: My friends and family could not possibly move to live in Medford, and that's, I think, a real problem.

283
00:31:04,203 --> 00:31:14,212
[SPEAKER_33]: And the things I want are more housing, less parking, more flexibility in land use across the board.

284
00:31:14,232 --> 00:31:20,218
[SPEAKER_33]: I think we should all be so lucky to live in a place where rent is affordable.

285
00:31:20,818 --> 00:31:25,459
[SPEAKER_33]: And we can walk and get you know some groceries on the corner and a coffee on the other corner.

286
00:31:25,479 --> 00:31:29,880
[SPEAKER_33]: And I think that this zoning represents a very real step towards that.

287
00:31:31,241 --> 00:31:34,902
[SPEAKER_33]: So mostly I'm just speaking highly in support of this.

288
00:31:36,482 --> 00:31:39,323
[SPEAKER_33]: The last thing I'll speak in support of that this seems to be doing.

289
00:31:40,443 --> 00:31:43,844
[SPEAKER_33]: is keeping the zoning as simple as possible.

290
00:31:44,384 --> 00:32:04,110
[SPEAKER_33]: I think the simpler it can be and the fewer things that need to go to the CBD or to the zoning board, the more quickly people can build things, the more quickly we can have changes, and the less expensive it is to build.

291
00:32:05,411 --> 00:32:08,152
[SPEAKER_33]: I have friends and family who develop buildings.

292
00:32:09,392 --> 00:32:16,259
[SPEAKER_33]: And it's amazing the years and decades that you can spend waiting for something to be approved.

293
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:21,684
[SPEAKER_33]: And that adds a lot of expense to all of our housing that I think is really unnecessary.

294
00:32:22,044 --> 00:32:23,705
[SPEAKER_33]: So I'm really excited for this.

295
00:32:23,986 --> 00:32:26,168
[SPEAKER_33]: And I'll yield my last 12 seconds back.

296
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:28,610
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Javid.

297
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:29,511
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate it.

298
00:32:29,811 --> 00:32:30,492
[SPEAKER_21]: Time is money.

299
00:32:30,832 --> 00:32:31,893
[SPEAKER_21]: So point well heard.

300
00:32:34,214 --> 00:32:37,898
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that we have is Evan Glasson.

301
00:32:38,338 --> 00:32:40,340
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

302
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,562
[SPEAKER_21]: You will see a request to unmute.

303
00:32:44,166 --> 00:32:44,386
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.

304
00:32:44,766 --> 00:32:45,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everyone.

305
00:32:45,427 --> 00:32:46,187
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Evan Glasson.

306
00:32:46,407 --> 00:32:50,049
[SPEAKER_03]: I am a homeowner at 16 Butler Street in Medford.

307
00:32:50,669 --> 00:33:03,815
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted to speak up and say that I am really very much in support of this rezoning effort, specifically in the Salem Street corridor, but also the broader citywide rezoning plan.

308
00:33:05,095 --> 00:33:13,178
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate the thorough work of this board and the consultants who have been a part of this and listening to the public feedback on the matter.

309
00:33:14,258 --> 00:33:28,804
[SPEAKER_03]: I personally am really, really excited to make Medford a place that more people can benefit from, that more people can live in, that is more walkable, more fun to be in because of that walkability and all of the cool places that

310
00:33:29,224 --> 00:33:31,045
[SPEAKER_03]: that can come as a part of this plan.

311
00:33:31,105 --> 00:33:42,030
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just really, really excited for what's ahead for Medford and the work that we are doing to help address the housing crisis that we're facing.

312
00:33:42,050 --> 00:33:43,471
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.

313
00:33:45,412 --> 00:33:45,952
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Evan.

314
00:33:48,754 --> 00:33:52,675
[SPEAKER_21]: The next speaker that we have is Carlene Campbell Hegarty.

315
00:33:53,936 --> 00:33:57,798
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record and you will get a request to unmute shortly.

316
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:00,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, can you hear me?

317
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:01,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

318
00:34:02,506 --> 00:34:03,046
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, great.

319
00:34:03,086 --> 00:34:06,369
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Carly Campbell Hegarty, 49 Elmont Street.

320
00:34:07,370 --> 00:34:11,013
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm here tonight to say, first of all, thank you, Emily.

321
00:34:11,153 --> 00:34:19,579
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that was a very long meeting that we had in February, and you did take a lot of our ideas and listen to what we had to say, so I appreciate that.

322
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,885
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not, though, I'm for good zoning.

323
00:34:27,495 --> 00:34:30,156
[SPEAKER_07]: that can enhance and revitalize an area.

324
00:34:30,796 --> 00:34:32,957
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we're quite there yet.

325
00:34:33,358 --> 00:34:43,342
[SPEAKER_07]: And part of that reason was it took so long for the people who are going to be affected the most to be heard in February, but I'm very impressed by what happened afterwards.

326
00:34:44,002 --> 00:34:46,643
[SPEAKER_07]: I have two suggestions, one question.

327
00:34:47,464 --> 00:34:49,305
[SPEAKER_07]: My question regarding is,

328
00:34:50,525 --> 00:34:55,767
[SPEAKER_07]: Before we finalize everything, looking into traffic studies, parking studies, and shadow studies.

329
00:34:56,567 --> 00:35:07,632
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, since we're going to be building up density, more people, more cars, more everything else, will the infrastructure, the water, the sewer be able to take all that on?

330
00:35:09,393 --> 00:35:10,473
[SPEAKER_07]: That's one statement.

331
00:35:10,713 --> 00:35:19,597
[SPEAKER_07]: My other statement would be communication to the general community needs to be improved, especially butters and the people directly affected by all of this.

332
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:23,267
[SPEAKER_07]: People have emailed the address now.

333
00:35:23,307 --> 00:35:24,828
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hoping they'll use it.

334
00:35:25,549 --> 00:35:33,695
[SPEAKER_07]: And then my last statement that I would like to talk about is, Emily, you said you made a lot of changes with the buy right items.

335
00:35:33,915 --> 00:35:36,017
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm sorry, you were talking very quickly.

336
00:35:36,057 --> 00:35:37,157
[SPEAKER_07]: It was really hard to see.

337
00:35:38,558 --> 00:35:41,700
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just curious about the methadone dispensary.

338
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:47,202
[SPEAKER_07]: It was MX1, MX2, that's the medical center under that guise.

339
00:35:48,103 --> 00:35:51,464
[SPEAKER_07]: We at the meeting said we didn't want any new medical buildings.

340
00:35:51,564 --> 00:35:53,865
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, was that taking off the table or not?

341
00:35:58,428 --> 00:36:02,229
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you have any other questions, Carleen?

342
00:36:02,329 --> 00:36:07,252
[SPEAKER_21]: Just because your time is up, but I think that is a very valid question for us to respond to.

343
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:10,591
[SPEAKER_07]: I have just two very quick questions.

344
00:36:10,651 --> 00:36:11,671
[SPEAKER_07]: I will talk really fast.

345
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:23,214
[SPEAKER_07]: In the remaining ones that you didn't touch on, like the research and testing lab, the dormitory, the shelters, the exempt architecture, is that still in the list?

346
00:36:23,574 --> 00:36:28,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it only looks like things should change, not everything that was previously in that people asked to be removed.

347
00:36:29,035 --> 00:36:33,536
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's sort of my nutshell question, and I really need answers on those.

348
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:42,453
[SPEAKER_21]: Great, so we're gonna conclude your time for public comment, but I am going to pass it over to Emily Innes to respond.

349
00:36:42,473 --> 00:36:44,153
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

350
00:36:44,173 --> 00:36:44,813
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Carly.

351
00:36:46,154 --> 00:36:48,254
[SPEAKER_13]: With your permission, Madam Chair, I'm happy to respond.

352
00:36:48,274 --> 00:36:51,995
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just going to briefly share the table of uses.

353
00:36:53,035 --> 00:36:58,297
[SPEAKER_13]: And it looks like there may be one that we thought we had caught, but we didn't, so I'm glad you brought it up.

354
00:36:58,857 --> 00:37:00,457
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is the table of uses.

355
00:37:00,857 --> 00:37:03,018
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the actual draft zoning itself.

356
00:37:04,218 --> 00:37:06,999
[SPEAKER_13]: MR1, MX1, MX2, commercial.

357
00:37:07,399 --> 00:37:10,299
[SPEAKER_13]: This PC is the parking requirements.

358
00:37:10,339 --> 00:37:14,020
[SPEAKER_13]: We have not changed those from the existing city parking requirements.

359
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,361
[SPEAKER_13]: And the LC is the loading requirements.

360
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,981
[SPEAKER_13]: It's primarily commercial or multiple development.

361
00:37:21,581 --> 00:37:29,183
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think what has not been changed, I'm glad you called that out, and I'm just going to highlight it for Appella's and my purposes.

362
00:37:30,243 --> 00:37:37,427
[SPEAKER_13]: And for the CD boards recommendation is dormitory fraternity or sorority house I thought we'd take I think we both thought we'd taken it out of mix one.

363
00:37:37,887 --> 00:37:49,473
[SPEAKER_13]: It's still in there but we should have that lodging or boarding house is special permit senior housing facility special permit, I don't believe those have changed probably you can correct me if I'm wrong.

364
00:37:49,874 --> 00:37:52,295
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't believe those have changed from existing zoning.

365
00:37:53,916 --> 00:37:58,078
[SPEAKER_13]: And the other ones you had asked about, I apologize for making people dizzy.

366
00:37:58,438 --> 00:38:01,960
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm searching for the highlighted ones, which are the ones that we had changed.

367
00:38:03,661 --> 00:38:07,563
[SPEAKER_13]: We did remove brewery from the MX1.

368
00:38:07,623 --> 00:38:10,545
[SPEAKER_13]: We removed hotel from the entire district.

369
00:38:11,585 --> 00:38:16,749
[SPEAKER_13]: And then here's what we did was we removed medical office from the entire district.

370
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:22,314
[SPEAKER_13]: We did remove neighborhood medical office from MX1.

371
00:38:22,834 --> 00:38:29,480
[SPEAKER_13]: We heard there were some strong voices in the room for no medical at all.

372
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,262
[SPEAKER_13]: We had heard separately from a few people that liked the ability to be able to walk to their dentist, etc.

373
00:38:36,362 --> 00:38:48,046
[SPEAKER_13]: So, the neighborhood medical office, I had mentioned earlier in the discussion that the neighborhood medical office is limited by the number of employees, by the square footage.

374
00:38:48,366 --> 00:38:55,088
[SPEAKER_13]: There's also changed the definition, which I apologize, I forgot to mention, which limits it by the hours as well, that's in your new zoning.

375
00:38:55,788 --> 00:39:00,870
[SPEAKER_13]: We had talked about it, but it had gotten crossed out accidentally, so that is back in there.

376
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:13,975
[SPEAKER_13]: So at any rate, with those limitations and with the requirement of a special permit for the CD board, so essentially the strongest controls we can put on it, we did leave that in the Mix 2 and in the commercial.

377
00:39:14,696 --> 00:39:17,757
[SPEAKER_13]: The commercial is that single parcel on the other side of the Fellsway.

378
00:39:18,077 --> 00:39:19,758
[SPEAKER_13]: The Mix 2 is the red.

379
00:39:19,798 --> 00:39:25,120
[SPEAKER_13]: Otherwise, it's sort of planned northeast, the area where Salem Street and the Fellsway intersect.

380
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:29,421
[SPEAKER_13]: And then let me just double check the other ones that we talked about.

381
00:39:29,481 --> 00:39:42,563
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, apologize for the here are the changes to the parking areas, which again, MR is now consistent with neighborhood 3, which is currently on its way to the CD board.

382
00:39:42,923 --> 00:39:46,164
[SPEAKER_13]: Here are the other changes to the parking area that we talked about.

383
00:39:46,204 --> 00:39:51,505
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think you asked about the research labs.

384
00:39:51,745 --> 00:39:53,125
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought we'd taken that out.

385
00:39:53,165 --> 00:39:53,605
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me just.

386
00:39:54,307 --> 00:39:55,608
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's further down.

387
00:39:57,931 --> 00:40:02,255
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a long list of uses because this is actually your entire list.

388
00:40:02,636 --> 00:40:03,397
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, so here we go.

389
00:40:03,437 --> 00:40:06,980
[SPEAKER_13]: Life science facility is not allowed in any part of the district.

390
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:10,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Food production facility not allowed in any part of the district.

391
00:40:11,145 --> 00:40:16,090
[SPEAKER_13]: Distillery or winery and light manufacturing, again, not allowed in any part of the district.

392
00:40:16,350 --> 00:40:25,019
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that takes care of everything, except the dorms, and I would recommend to the city board, our apologies for missing that.

393
00:40:25,059 --> 00:40:32,307
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought we'd caught it, but I would recommend that to be changed in your recommendations to city council, if that is acceptable to you all.

394
00:40:45,093 --> 00:40:49,556
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to state, Emily has just fallen off.

395
00:40:49,616 --> 00:40:51,077
[SPEAKER_24]: She lost her internet connection.

396
00:40:51,557 --> 00:40:52,598
[SPEAKER_24]: She just texted me.

397
00:40:52,618 --> 00:40:58,742
[SPEAKER_24]: She is moving to a different location at her home where she can pick up the Wi-Fi.

398
00:41:00,103 --> 00:41:04,766
[SPEAKER_24]: She asked that Peter could sub in and share until she gets back online.

399
00:41:04,786 --> 00:41:05,986
[SPEAKER_24]: We do still have a quorum.

400
00:41:06,006 --> 00:41:08,868
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to state that for everyone.

401
00:41:10,389 --> 00:41:11,009
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure, okay.

402
00:41:13,547 --> 00:41:20,750
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the next person up, the name is just Navar.

403
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:27,052
[SPEAKER_17]: And you should be getting a notification to unmute.

404
00:41:27,292 --> 00:41:31,074
[SPEAKER_17]: And then if you could please state your name and address for the record.

405
00:41:31,294 --> 00:41:31,654
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

406
00:41:38,736 --> 00:41:39,697
[SPEAKER_17]: You're muted.

407
00:41:40,657 --> 00:41:41,998
[SPEAKER_17]: You're not muted on Zoom.

408
00:41:43,632 --> 00:41:44,072
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, here we go.

409
00:41:44,092 --> 00:41:44,673
[SPEAKER_30]: Is that any better?

410
00:41:44,693 --> 00:41:46,134
[SPEAKER_30]: Yes, thank you.

411
00:41:46,515 --> 00:41:48,597
[SPEAKER_30]: William DeVar, 108 Bedford Street, apartment 1B.

412
00:41:49,478 --> 00:41:58,386
[SPEAKER_30]: My message is basically that at this point, it seems that the zoning for apartments and so on has really been reduced significantly.

413
00:41:58,406 --> 00:42:01,930
[SPEAKER_30]: I find that quite disappointing.

414
00:42:03,818 --> 00:42:07,923
[SPEAKER_30]: It sounds like most of Salem Street, you can't have more than three units now.

415
00:42:08,604 --> 00:42:16,074
[SPEAKER_30]: And not more than four stories is I think my understanding based on the preliminary, you know, presentation at the beginning of this meeting.

416
00:42:17,185 --> 00:42:19,367
[SPEAKER_30]: And I think that's disappointing.

417
00:42:19,387 --> 00:42:24,030
[SPEAKER_30]: I've been attending this process through the entire thing.

418
00:42:24,130 --> 00:42:40,922
[SPEAKER_30]: I thought that we were at a good level of increasing the density and the proximity, the number of people we can have in our neighborhoods, the amount of housing we can have to really make sure people can find an apartment and contribute to that 222,000 unit shortage that the state government has found that we have.

419
00:42:46,728 --> 00:42:52,001
[SPEAKER_30]: And it looks like we're moving in the direction with some of these changes of not achieving that goal.

420
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:59,611
[SPEAKER_30]: I'll continue to stay engaged with the process and see what happens, but I do find that disappointing.

421
00:42:59,731 --> 00:43:08,434
[SPEAKER_30]: So if there's any way that some of that density that the consultants proposed originally could be restored, I'd really be excited to see that.

422
00:43:09,694 --> 00:43:20,037
[SPEAKER_30]: Both here and as we go forward throughout that citywide zoning process, I really hope we make sure that we're not compromising too much on that being one of our goals.

423
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:20,857
[SPEAKER_30]: Thanks a lot.

424
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:23,340
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, William.

425
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,921
[SPEAKER_17]: And it looks like Emily is back.

426
00:43:26,261 --> 00:43:28,162
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'll hand the chair back over to her.

427
00:43:29,863 --> 00:43:30,463
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Peter.

428
00:43:30,483 --> 00:43:34,065
[SPEAKER_21]: And apologies for that.

429
00:43:34,185 --> 00:43:35,886
[SPEAKER_21]: I lost Wi-Fi in my apartment.

430
00:43:36,906 --> 00:43:39,407
[SPEAKER_21]: And if I don't have Wi-Fi, I have no cell phone service.

431
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:40,908
[SPEAKER_21]: But thankfully, it came back on.

432
00:43:41,408 --> 00:43:43,789
[SPEAKER_21]: And I apologize to members of the public whose comments I missed.

433
00:43:43,889 --> 00:43:50,852
[SPEAKER_21]: But I trust that other members of the board will be able to cover comments when we come back for discussion.

434
00:43:54,295 --> 00:43:59,299
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, with that, the next person that I see is Erika DeRoche.

435
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,741
[SPEAKER_21]: Erika, please state your name.

436
00:44:03,322 --> 00:44:03,782
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, wait.

437
00:44:03,862 --> 00:44:05,503
[SPEAKER_21]: Am I going out of order?

438
00:44:06,924 --> 00:44:08,065
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, you're one off, I think.

439
00:44:08,085 --> 00:44:09,646
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know if that's just because you dropped.

440
00:44:09,666 --> 00:44:10,147
[SPEAKER_21]: Harrison.

441
00:44:10,667 --> 00:44:10,907
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

442
00:44:10,987 --> 00:44:11,488
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, Harrison.

443
00:44:11,508 --> 00:44:12,769
[SPEAKER_21]: She's all out of order right now.

444
00:44:12,889 --> 00:44:15,751
[SPEAKER_21]: So Peter, maybe do you want to flag people?

445
00:44:15,771 --> 00:44:15,851
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.

446
00:44:17,637 --> 00:44:21,318
[SPEAKER_21]: OK, so Harrison, thank you for your patience.

447
00:44:22,678 --> 00:44:27,020
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record, and you're going to get a request to unmute.

448
00:44:33,141 --> 00:44:34,242
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't hear you, Harrison.

449
00:44:37,442 --> 00:44:42,684
[SPEAKER_21]: We haven't started the timer, though, so we'll make sure we can hear you before we get going.

450
00:44:43,964 --> 00:44:45,785
[SPEAKER_21]: I can hear you now, I think.

451
00:44:45,805 --> 00:44:45,865
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

452
00:44:47,401 --> 00:44:49,843
[SPEAKER_23]: Harrison green to run away road in Medford.

453
00:44:50,323 --> 00:44:53,185
[SPEAKER_23]: Um, I'm excited for this process in general.

454
00:44:53,466 --> 00:44:55,927
[SPEAKER_23]: I do definitely regret not getting involved earlier.

455
00:44:56,428 --> 00:44:58,669
[SPEAKER_23]: While not a resident of the Salem street.

456
00:44:59,170 --> 00:45:05,234
[SPEAKER_23]: Corridor I am looking for meant for to develop more housing units to address the housing shortage.

457
00:45:05,354 --> 00:45:05,514
[SPEAKER_23]: So.

458
00:45:06,835 --> 00:45:25,790
[SPEAKER_23]: echoing the previous speaker that the reduction is disappointing for me as well, and I'm looking to get more involved in future zoning and to accelerate the zoning as it moves into especially the neighborhood that affects me the most in West Medford to add the density here that we need so much.

459
00:45:26,291 --> 00:45:26,611
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you.

460
00:45:33,236 --> 00:45:33,897
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Harrison.

461
00:45:37,095 --> 00:46:06,047

462
00:46:07,277 --> 00:46:11,551
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you all for hearing my comments and I do have one question at the end.

463
00:46:14,098 --> 00:46:19,440
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to say that I am strongly in favor of the zoning taking place across the city.

464
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:32,364
[SPEAKER_15]: I was also strongly in favor of this, you know, I thought very like sensible approach to increasing density on the Salem Street corridor as originally proposed.

465
00:46:33,325 --> 00:46:42,448
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm really excited about what's happening in the city and all of the work, very like detailed form work that you're doing to, you know, document

466
00:46:43,689 --> 00:46:53,862
[SPEAKER_15]: The conditions in the various neighborhoods to listen carefully to residents I think it's really important and, and I applaud you all for your very comprehensive work.

467
00:46:55,704 --> 00:46:59,409
[SPEAKER_15]: But I will say that based on this evening's presentations.

468
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:07,269
[SPEAKER_15]: I am a little disappointed to see that some of that density is being walked back.

469
00:47:07,869 --> 00:47:16,675
[SPEAKER_15]: Not that I'm not disappointed at all in the response that Innes Associates has given to community feedback.

470
00:47:16,895 --> 00:47:19,937
[SPEAKER_15]: I really appreciate how sensitively you've responded.

471
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:29,583
[SPEAKER_15]: And at the same time, I would like to see the city have a place to go from where it is currently.

472
00:47:30,076 --> 00:47:40,379
[SPEAKER_15]: Like when I see the MR1 is now maximum of three units, that does not increase the density.

473
00:47:41,419 --> 00:47:50,382
[SPEAKER_15]: That does not allow any sort of densification for the future, for the next 30 years.

474
00:47:50,782 --> 00:47:59,424
[SPEAKER_15]: And when I see that now there's a section, that section near Park Street, understood you're responding to community concerns,

475
00:47:59,989 --> 00:48:03,850
[SPEAKER_15]: But that section changed from MU2 to MU1.

476
00:48:04,231 --> 00:48:06,791
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, now that's a maximum of three stories.

477
00:48:07,332 --> 00:48:21,657
[SPEAKER_15]: That, in effect, does not increase the density because two stories are allowed, so are currently permitted, if I'm correct, if I've remembered that correctly, two and two and a half stories is

478
00:48:22,419 --> 00:48:29,628
[SPEAKER_15]: Basically three stories, so that also does not increase the density and does not allow any development.

479
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:40,616
[SPEAKER_15]: or does not promote development in that section of Medford in the way that I would like it to see it moving.

480
00:48:42,037 --> 00:48:45,920
[SPEAKER_21]: Real quick, Erika, I'm sorry, we didn't set a timer, but I just want to give you a thought.

481
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,441
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just wrapping up.

482
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:58,770
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, I just wanted to say, I do have like one question, which is a comment that I heard at the listening session and that I wasn't clear on

483
00:49:00,974 --> 00:49:15,467
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that the community could use some clarification on why zoning changes do not include traffic, shadow, or other studies.

484
00:49:16,067 --> 00:49:27,257
[SPEAKER_15]: Because as an architect, I have to submit projects for review, and there are so many components and parameters for each project that in order

485
00:49:28,670 --> 00:49:38,954
[SPEAKER_15]: there would just be an infinite number of massings and traffic patterns that could be studied for an entire neighborhood.

486
00:49:39,414 --> 00:49:57,320
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think that it would be really helpful for planning and in this associates to work to clarify that for the community, why those studies have not been conducted or have not been made available

487
00:49:58,255 --> 00:50:05,024
[SPEAKER_15]: because it's just not a feasible thing and has to be done on a development by development basis.

488
00:50:05,264 --> 00:50:08,148
[SPEAKER_15]: So that's my comment and thank you again for listening.

489
00:50:08,168 --> 00:50:10,191
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Erica.

490
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:16,522
[SPEAKER_21]: Erica made some comments about density.

491
00:50:16,542 --> 00:50:32,434
[SPEAKER_21]: But I agree, like, it's it's definitely a bummer that, you know, the the unit count has decreased in that specific part of the zoning.

492
00:50:33,094 --> 00:50:41,280
[SPEAKER_21]: But I want to get some clarity in terms of, like, what density may be allowed, like, where are we increasing density?

493
00:50:41,901 --> 00:50:43,042
[SPEAKER_21]: Emily, would you be able to

494
00:50:44,662 --> 00:50:45,662
[SPEAKER_21]: to address that question.

495
00:50:46,842 --> 00:50:48,903
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, I would be happy to Madam Chair.

496
00:50:48,943 --> 00:50:49,523
[SPEAKER_13]: And thank you.

497
00:50:49,583 --> 00:50:50,443
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for that question.

498
00:50:50,483 --> 00:50:54,184
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd also like to address at least some of the studies question.

499
00:50:54,684 --> 00:50:56,285
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, that's helpful as well.

500
00:50:56,325 --> 00:50:57,745
[SPEAKER_13]: But let's start with the density.

501
00:50:57,845 --> 00:51:07,147
[SPEAKER_13]: So I do want to clarify, and I'll just pull up the map again, if you all don't mind, just so we can see what we're looking at.

502
00:51:08,387 --> 00:51:17,491
[SPEAKER_13]: So this was the proposal as of January 22nd, and you can see the red here for the Mix-2 and the red over here for the Mix-2.

503
00:51:17,531 --> 00:51:21,633
[SPEAKER_13]: This is the Park Street intersection with Salem Street at that first one.

504
00:51:21,653 --> 00:51:23,694
[SPEAKER_13]: A couple of things going on here.

505
00:51:23,854 --> 00:51:26,775
[SPEAKER_13]: One, obviously, here it changes to Mix-1.

506
00:51:26,895 --> 00:51:30,937
[SPEAKER_13]: We leave the Mix-2 up in the northeast corner alone.

507
00:51:30,977 --> 00:51:31,837
[SPEAKER_13]: That stays Mix-2.

508
00:51:31,877 --> 00:51:33,678
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're not changing anything here.

509
00:51:34,678 --> 00:51:42,902
[SPEAKER_13]: Here, yes, it's three stories with a four-story as an incentive bonus option.

510
00:51:42,922 --> 00:51:45,423
[SPEAKER_13]: A couple of things to consider here.

511
00:51:45,583 --> 00:51:49,024
[SPEAKER_13]: One is at least some of these buildings along here are single-story.

512
00:51:49,644 --> 00:52:00,689
[SPEAKER_13]: So where it might not be attractive to redevelop from a single-story to a two-story, a single-story to a three-story or a three-and-a-half with the incentive.

513
00:52:00,769 --> 00:52:03,110
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll tell you in a minute why I'm not saying four necessarily.

514
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:06,852
[SPEAKER_13]: that might be more attractive for somebody to redevelop over time.

515
00:52:07,312 --> 00:52:14,296
[SPEAKER_13]: The reason I'm not saying for is we've actually started to do some test diagrams.

516
00:52:14,316 --> 00:52:18,059
[SPEAKER_13]: We're kind of not happy with where they are, which is why you're not seeing them.

517
00:52:18,119 --> 00:52:19,519
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I'm happy with the quality of it.

518
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:23,722
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not happy that it's showing what or it's coming to the result

519
00:52:24,422 --> 00:52:38,998
[SPEAKER_13]: that I think we want to be able to show and part of that is your parking regulations are acting as a significant deterrent to development here so that on some of these parcels you'll see if

520
00:52:40,399 --> 00:52:41,620
[SPEAKER_13]: It lets me zoom in.

521
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:42,840
[SPEAKER_13]: Will it let me do zoom in?

522
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:43,481
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, it will.

523
00:52:43,841 --> 00:52:52,986
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll see that the parcels along Salem Street, because of the way the street curves, are irregular in shape, many of them.

524
00:52:53,006 --> 00:52:57,648
[SPEAKER_13]: You've got some of these with these narrow openings and the longer depths.

525
00:52:57,668 --> 00:52:59,709
[SPEAKER_13]: You've got some that are quite shallow.

526
00:53:00,249 --> 00:53:03,551
[SPEAKER_13]: They are very difficult to park under your current regulations.

527
00:53:03,611 --> 00:53:05,152
[SPEAKER_13]: So while we can get

528
00:53:06,552 --> 00:53:11,914
[SPEAKER_13]: On the sites that we've tested, we can get to three, but only a few of them can we get to four.

529
00:53:11,934 --> 00:53:20,217
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want to keep that in mind that although I know it's a disappointment for some people to drop from six stories to four stories,

530
00:53:20,917 --> 00:53:23,418
[SPEAKER_13]: In fact, it's not easy to achieve.

531
00:53:23,438 --> 00:53:26,739
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not easy to achieve four stories here.

532
00:53:26,759 --> 00:53:28,660
[SPEAKER_13]: We have not tried to do a six story.

533
00:53:29,541 --> 00:53:35,943
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think you would end up with a good portion of the lots being parking rather than building.

534
00:53:36,023 --> 00:53:42,226
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think if you're thinking of development along the street, you're going to want more building along the street and less parking.

535
00:53:42,306 --> 00:53:45,167
[SPEAKER_13]: We certainly don't want empty parking lots along the street.

536
00:53:45,267 --> 00:53:47,268
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that's part of the balance as well.

537
00:53:47,828 --> 00:53:51,091
[SPEAKER_13]: it's listening to the community, and then it's doing those tests.

538
00:53:51,231 --> 00:54:11,446
[SPEAKER_13]: And that test brings me to another point, and I think the previous speaker had, you know, made an excellent point when thinking about doing, whether it's shadow studies or traffic studies or infrastructure studies, is that zoning provides options to property owners, right?

539
00:54:11,486 --> 00:54:16,951
[SPEAKER_13]: When you change zoning, you're giving them a new option, and it's up to them as to whether or not they exercise it.

540
00:54:17,471 --> 00:54:27,661
[SPEAKER_13]: We have done build-out studies in the past before that show what would happen if every single parcel changed to the maximum available development.

541
00:54:28,042 --> 00:54:29,884
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's not realistic.

542
00:54:30,184 --> 00:54:40,935
[SPEAKER_13]: And to come forward and say that every parcel would change to that maximum and then build your studies on top of it, and then have a policy of investing based on those studies,

543
00:54:41,795 --> 00:54:49,620
[SPEAKER_13]: knowing that the likelihood is that most of those parcels won't change as expected, I think that that's an unrealistic exercise to put the city through.

544
00:54:50,260 --> 00:55:06,110
[SPEAKER_13]: Instead, what is required, and it's an appropriate place to be required, is pretty much exactly what the previous speaker described, which is at a point at which a project that meets certain thresholds comes before the CD board, that's when those studies are created.

545
00:55:06,830 --> 00:55:13,656
[SPEAKER_13]: And at that point, you have a real project with a real number of units or a real number of square footage for commercial.

546
00:55:15,077 --> 00:55:25,025
[SPEAKER_13]: And it is possible to calculate studies that give a true picture of what the impact will be rather than a build out scenario that might not be accurate.

547
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:32,811
[SPEAKER_13]: accurate ever, or if it is accurate, it's so far into the future, the study that's done has no real purpose.

548
00:55:33,352 --> 00:55:42,860
[SPEAKER_13]: The other thing I do want to say is I know there's some frustration from some of the people who have spoken about, you know, not getting as much density as hoped.

549
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:50,987
[SPEAKER_13]: But there's one thing that I think is critically important, and we've talked a lot about residential uses, but not so much about the business uses.

550
00:55:51,667 --> 00:56:00,611
[SPEAKER_13]: And for anybody who saw the presentation at the public meeting, the vast majority of businesses along Salem Street are in fact non-conforming.

551
00:56:01,092 --> 00:56:08,435
[SPEAKER_13]: And one of the big changes this would make is to allow most of those to become conforming, that allows the business owners to invest.

552
00:56:08,595 --> 00:56:18,060
[SPEAKER_13]: So we did hear from quite a few people that they enjoyed having their neighborhood commercial, being able to walk to it, being able to patronize local businesses.

553
00:56:18,620 --> 00:56:36,092
[SPEAKER_13]: those local businesses are from a zoning perspective, they're non-conforming, you know, they had been pre-existing before the zoning came in, and what we're trying to do is to help them out, help them continue by allowing them, in many cases, as a right.

554
00:56:36,932 --> 00:56:38,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Not all of them, but in many cases.

555
00:56:38,554 --> 00:56:42,516
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that's an important thing that we haven't talked about in terms of the zoning.

556
00:56:43,257 --> 00:56:46,539
[SPEAKER_13]: And with that, Madam Chair, I'll yield the rest of this time.

557
00:56:48,987 --> 00:56:49,127
[SPEAKER_25]: Great.

558
00:56:49,387 --> 00:56:50,048
[SPEAKER_25]: Thank you, Emily.

559
00:56:55,151 --> 00:56:57,212
[SPEAKER_17]: Next would be on my screen is Michael Chong.

560
00:57:00,074 --> 00:57:02,036
[SPEAKER_21]: Michael, you're going to get a request to unmute.

561
00:57:02,176 --> 00:57:05,878
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

562
00:57:05,898 --> 00:57:05,938
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi.

563
00:57:17,290 --> 00:57:21,373
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Michael Chan, address is 168 Willis Avenue.

564
00:57:22,293 --> 00:57:33,660
[SPEAKER_16]: I would like to echo actually my, I just found out my neighbor down the street, Erica's request to do a traffic report on this area.

565
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:41,364
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm hearing a lot of the kind of, but before I get into it, highly support everything that's been done here.

566
00:57:41,384 --> 00:57:42,385
[SPEAKER_16]: It sounds very thoughtful.

567
00:57:43,165 --> 00:57:45,347
[SPEAKER_16]: I love the idea that there's the,

568
00:57:46,682 --> 00:57:53,666
[SPEAKER_16]: The goal here is to make it a much more welcoming and walkable and community unifying area.

569
00:57:54,426 --> 00:58:05,313
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm hearing a lot of ideas and dreams of this area being somewhere where businesses and neighborhoods are kind of connected together through walkability.

570
00:58:06,253 --> 00:58:12,797
[SPEAKER_16]: I am curious, though, given that there was a Medford resident who was killed on the western end of Salem Street,

571
00:58:14,287 --> 00:58:19,889
[SPEAKER_16]: how much of this road will actually be incorporating traffic calming measures.

572
00:58:21,730 --> 00:58:28,653
[SPEAKER_16]: Especially as a bicycle commuter, I do go through Salem Street every so often.

573
00:58:29,413 --> 00:58:37,776
[SPEAKER_16]: I only go every so often because it is a very busy tight road with a lot of large vehicles, in part because there are no other

574
00:58:39,831 --> 00:58:46,433
[SPEAKER_16]: byways of connecting that rotary to the area around Target.

575
00:58:47,893 --> 00:59:06,679
[SPEAKER_16]: And so, yeah, I think there is a lot of components in what would create a, I think there would be an effort to make this a street that is not becoming a highway.

576
00:59:09,088 --> 00:59:13,430
[SPEAKER_16]: For cars, because of, you know, reducing the density of.

577
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:19,052
[SPEAKER_16]: Homes, you know, making the parking requirements such that.

578
00:59:19,873 --> 00:59:20,773
[SPEAKER_16]: The oops.

579
00:59:21,653 --> 00:59:25,215
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, my time is up, but yes, yeah, so, um.

580
00:59:25,758 --> 00:59:44,182
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I understand that it's a very complex problem, but I would like to really highlight the need for making sure that this effort to develop this area is not undermined by the fact that there is traffic cutting right through the center of this corridor.

581
00:59:46,191 --> 00:59:46,831
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Michael.

582
00:59:46,851 --> 00:59:48,132
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate your comments.

583
00:59:48,992 --> 00:59:54,275
[SPEAKER_21]: And just to clarify, the zoning that we're looking at is really only regulating private land.

584
00:59:54,555 --> 01:00:01,498
[SPEAKER_21]: So things like roads would not fall under the jurisdiction of this zoning change.

585
01:00:02,158 --> 01:00:04,859
[SPEAKER_21]: Emily and Paula, I don't know if you have anything to add to that.

586
01:00:09,361 --> 01:00:09,902
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, go ahead.

587
01:00:10,662 --> 01:00:14,844
[SPEAKER_21]: I just want to confirm that my understanding is correct and kind of reiterate it for the public.

588
01:00:15,894 --> 01:00:20,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, that is correct traffic called that because this is a strictly zoning study.

589
01:00:20,136 --> 01:00:22,717
[SPEAKER_13]: This is traffic calming measures are not part of that.

590
01:00:23,377 --> 01:00:36,302
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, just to clarify for for people who aren't familiar, the city's right of way, which would include the sidewalks in the street does not fall under zoning zoning.

591
01:00:36,342 --> 01:00:39,763
[SPEAKER_13]: As you said earlier, Madam chair covers the private market.

592
01:00:41,162 --> 01:00:45,924
[SPEAKER_13]: And in some limited cases, the non-municipal land.

593
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:47,704
[SPEAKER_13]: OK, great.

594
01:00:51,505 --> 01:00:54,747
[SPEAKER_21]: OK, Peter, who do we have next?

595
01:00:56,867 --> 01:00:59,528
[SPEAKER_17]: Next on my screen is Zachary Chertok.

596
01:01:00,468 --> 01:01:03,750
[SPEAKER_17]: And Emily, just let me know if at any point you've realigned to the order.

597
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:05,250
[SPEAKER_21]: I am not aligned at all.

598
01:01:05,970 --> 01:01:06,630
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, gotcha.

599
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:14,338
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, Zoom's going to be getting a user feature request pretty soon.

600
01:01:14,358 --> 01:01:15,720
[SPEAKER_26]: Gotcha.

601
01:01:16,581 --> 01:01:16,722
[SPEAKER_26]: OK.

602
01:01:17,523 --> 01:01:20,467
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, Zach, you're going to be getting a request to unmute.

603
01:01:20,948 --> 01:01:23,252
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

604
01:01:25,563 --> 01:01:29,005
[SPEAKER_34]: Zachary Chertok, 5 Almond Street, and I totally sympathize with the Zoom thing.

605
01:01:29,025 --> 01:01:29,985
[SPEAKER_34]: I have to deal with it every day.

606
01:01:31,566 --> 01:01:42,732
[SPEAKER_34]: Speaking as somebody who truly lives in this corridor and whose building is actually right in the middle of it geographically, first, they do appreciate the lower density changes made to the Park Street intersection and some of the scale back and height restrictions.

607
01:01:43,712 --> 01:01:44,953
[SPEAKER_34]: It's a good show of active listening.

608
01:01:45,933 --> 01:01:51,077
[SPEAKER_34]: Second, I'll reiterate, as I always have, that zoning conformity is generally a good thing and taking steps towards it is a good thing.

609
01:01:51,257 --> 01:01:53,618
[SPEAKER_34]: So the overall concept, fine.

610
01:01:54,619 --> 01:01:58,401
[SPEAKER_34]: But flipping the script, I do remain in demand of the proper existing condition studies.

611
01:01:58,441 --> 01:01:59,983
[SPEAKER_34]: We're not talking about build-out studies.

612
01:02:00,443 --> 01:02:02,684
[SPEAKER_34]: We're talking about the existing conditions of the neighborhood.

613
01:02:03,185 --> 01:02:13,492
[SPEAKER_34]: And as codified by the ASCE and American Planning Association, as somebody trained as an engineer, they specifically call for a list of existing condition studies that go into everything in planning efforts, including land use.

614
01:02:14,352 --> 01:02:18,613
[SPEAKER_34]: This community has repeatedly asked for those and has been denied them, so we're not talking about hypotheticals.

615
01:02:18,673 --> 01:02:22,935
[SPEAKER_34]: We're talking about the conditions now to inform what is and what could be.

616
01:02:23,995 --> 01:02:30,457
[SPEAKER_34]: And consequently, without those, this process is still incongruous because we don't have a bellwether to truly measure what the possibilities are.

617
01:02:30,477 --> 01:02:31,718
[SPEAKER_34]: It's like opening Pandora's box.

618
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:37,860
[SPEAKER_34]: I'd also like to restate my concerns about the density buildup on the border with Malden, which I've raised multiple times.

619
01:02:39,341 --> 01:02:44,903
[SPEAKER_34]: Creating a zoning imbalance is a recipe for future disasters in Congress with the neighboring city.

620
01:02:44,923 --> 01:02:52,407
[SPEAKER_34]: And while I echo many of the other community members on issues of affordable housing, Medford is not an island and can't address that issue by itself.

621
01:02:53,087 --> 01:03:01,590
[SPEAKER_34]: Speculative measures in the market right now are the leading variable in housing stock that continues to push the target for housing unit needs in the greater Boston area, even as more housing gets built.

622
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:03,050
[SPEAKER_34]: Every year that number goes up.

623
01:03:04,011 --> 01:03:12,533
[SPEAKER_34]: Consequently, as noted by Council President Bears at my own questioning during the last planning and permitting session, it's going to take a multi-factor regional approach to solving that issue.

624
01:03:12,674 --> 01:03:16,475
[SPEAKER_34]: Zoning by itself will not do it, so we have to make sure we're in congress with the neighborhood.

625
01:03:17,964 --> 01:03:28,534
[SPEAKER_34]: As noted in the last planning board session before the City Council, I also question the lack of addressing the density valley between individual quarters that are being rezoned and to date that issue still hasn't sufficiently been addressed.

626
01:03:29,255 --> 01:03:40,025
[SPEAKER_34]: The densest area in Medford here without transit access continues to be squeezed to be more dense planning on a section by section basis without presenting in the context of the wider urban fabric.

627
01:03:40,826 --> 01:03:52,550
[SPEAKER_34]: At that planning and permitting meeting, that was the first time I had seen a unified map, and it clearly showed that density was being added in the most dense sections while not being sufficiently increased around transit nodes.

628
01:03:54,410 --> 01:03:55,811
[SPEAKER_21]: My apologies, we didn't start a timer.

629
01:03:55,851 --> 01:03:56,511
[SPEAKER_34]: No, that's all right.

630
01:03:56,551 --> 01:03:59,072
[SPEAKER_34]: This is literally the last, this is the last bullet.

631
01:03:59,432 --> 01:03:59,692
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.

632
01:04:00,152 --> 01:04:04,033
[SPEAKER_34]: That it's just not being done around the transit nodes in direct access.

633
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:10,235
[SPEAKER_34]: So in terms of transit-oriented housing, despite promises of the City Council and the intent of this, that's not being accomplished here.

634
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:13,760
[SPEAKER_21]: That's it.

635
01:04:14,341 --> 01:04:15,842
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for your thoughtful comments, Zachary.

636
01:04:15,862 --> 01:04:18,443
[SPEAKER_21]: You've shown up to a lot of these.

637
01:04:18,503 --> 01:04:22,126
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate your continued advocacy for yourself and your neighbors in the community.

638
01:04:27,109 --> 01:04:28,890
[SPEAKER_17]: Next on the list is Penny Taylor.

639
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:33,674
[SPEAKER_21]: Penny, you're going to get a request to unmute.

640
01:04:33,774 --> 01:04:35,735
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

641
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:38,148
[SPEAKER_20]: Great, thank you.

642
01:04:38,228 --> 01:04:40,049
[SPEAKER_20]: Penny Taylor 29 Martin Street.

643
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:49,098
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm thrilled the zoning process is happening and I've already written in favor of ensuring robust housing opportunities throughout to be sure that we use every tool in the box.

644
01:04:49,679 --> 01:04:59,688
[SPEAKER_20]: I am deeply concerned and actually still shaking with disbelief by and ask you to reject the new proposed changes to change any multi unit residential from 3 to 6 units to only 1 to 3 units.

645
01:05:00,629 --> 01:05:08,036
[SPEAKER_20]: This does not match our needs, values, nor jive with all the other work the city is doing to encourage affordable housing development and utilize incentives.

646
01:05:08,496 --> 01:05:09,937
[SPEAKER_20]: We need more housing full stop.

647
01:05:10,278 --> 01:05:15,743
[SPEAKER_20]: Hampering that by not allowing creative and maximal uses at this critical opportunity is unacceptable.

648
01:05:16,663 --> 01:05:24,266
[SPEAKER_20]: I also want to express some deep concern in rejecting medical facilities when close to 30% of adults in the United States have some kind of disability.

649
01:05:24,686 --> 01:05:29,007
[SPEAKER_20]: Barriers to accessing housing and medical services should be taken down, not built in.

650
01:05:29,527 --> 01:05:34,629
[SPEAKER_20]: And I'm so disappointed to see a solid yes to banks and no to medical offices.

651
01:05:34,649 --> 01:05:37,150
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think that's a neighborhood that any of us really want to live in.

652
01:05:38,610 --> 01:05:44,675
[SPEAKER_20]: I also just put in a pitch that we all need to seriously take the call to move away from fossil fuels in the very near future.

653
01:05:44,975 --> 01:05:47,217
[SPEAKER_20]: So I love if we can plan a city for people instead of cars.

654
01:05:47,297 --> 01:05:47,617
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

655
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:51,500
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Penny.

656
01:05:54,563 --> 01:06:02,429
[SPEAKER_17]: The next person on the list is Cheryl R. Cheryl R, you're going to get a request to unmute.

657
01:06:02,449 --> 01:06:04,491
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

658
01:06:06,999 --> 01:06:11,064
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, I'm Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street, so I live on the corridor.

659
01:06:12,025 --> 01:06:18,253
[SPEAKER_28]: These changes that we're seeing tonight showed that there was a complete lack of planning and studies involved in writing this zoning in the first place.

660
01:06:18,713 --> 01:06:24,940
[SPEAKER_28]: If residents had it alerted and educated themselves, then this would have passed easily with the initial zoning voted to you.

661
01:06:25,801 --> 01:06:28,242
[SPEAKER_28]: The neighbors would have only found out when the first projects went up.

662
01:06:28,662 --> 01:06:33,063
[SPEAKER_28]: We have still done none of the studies called for in the comprehensive plan that Ennis helped write.

663
01:06:33,543 --> 01:06:36,203
[SPEAKER_28]: These zoning changes are reactive rather than informed.

664
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:46,546
[SPEAKER_28]: Zoning should not based on opinion and what people tell you that they like, especially from those who will not be impacted as the majority of those speaking in favor are not from this area.

665
01:06:47,106 --> 01:06:59,499
[SPEAKER_28]: We have no real definition for high frequency transit that allows 0.8 parking spaces and the parking minimums are set to be reduced in May and was actually mentioned by Emily as a factor that is limiting this density.

666
01:06:59,939 --> 01:07:05,025
[SPEAKER_28]: So the neighborhood will be severely impacted if parking levels are lowered.

667
01:07:05,665 --> 01:07:17,107
[SPEAKER_28]: along with this zoning and coupled with the neighborhood zoning that places us in the densest neighborhood zone in the city of three units on 3K lots will have a significant and immense impact on our area.

668
01:07:17,467 --> 01:07:32,650
[SPEAKER_28]: The 70% reduction in lot size to 3K that somehow isn't being mentioned, the doubling of the lot coverage to 80% will create the same planned mass and just two stories lower with the changes proposed suggested tonight.

669
01:07:33,090 --> 01:07:34,130
[SPEAKER_28]: in the area zone blue.

670
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:43,933
[SPEAKER_28]: The step back is eliminated despite the fact that the new max height will be 54 feet up from 35 feet which is an increase of 63 percent.

671
01:07:44,873 --> 01:07:51,935
[SPEAKER_28]: Methadone clinics can still come to the neighborhood medical which only limits number of employees and the size of the center.

672
01:07:52,855 --> 01:07:53,015
[SPEAKER_28]: So

673
01:07:54,569 --> 01:08:00,215
[SPEAKER_28]: Residents have been pointing out that the marijuana uses are in the zoning since December.

674
01:08:00,636 --> 01:08:07,423
[SPEAKER_28]: So we really don't want to keep hearing the excuse that they're poor zoning and lack of type proofreading is a typo.

675
01:08:07,943 --> 01:08:12,328
[SPEAKER_28]: If by version three, you haven't changed it, then you meant to be there.

676
01:08:13,007 --> 01:08:14,389
[SPEAKER_28]: The incentives haven't changed.

677
01:08:14,449 --> 01:08:15,690
[SPEAKER_28]: The lots are really small.

678
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:17,272
[SPEAKER_28]: All the waivers are in there.

679
01:08:17,672 --> 01:08:23,238
[SPEAKER_28]: The zoning should go back to the beginning and be studied, have community input, and then be written and adjusted.

680
01:08:23,559 --> 01:08:28,023
[SPEAKER_28]: This type of rewrite this late in the process is alarming.

681
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:29,105
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm right at the end.

682
01:08:29,505 --> 01:08:29,905
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

683
01:08:30,045 --> 01:08:33,187
[SPEAKER_28]: So this type of rewrite this late in the process is really alarming.

684
01:08:33,527 --> 01:08:40,209
[SPEAKER_28]: And for Emily's comment, the research and testing lab is on page seven of the zoning that was presented for this evening.

685
01:08:40,549 --> 01:08:41,650
[SPEAKER_28]: These are not typos.

686
01:08:41,890 --> 01:08:44,631
[SPEAKER_28]: These are a lack of scrutiny and attention to detail.

687
01:08:45,191 --> 01:08:45,652
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you.

688
01:08:46,872 --> 01:08:47,572
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Cheryl.

689
01:08:49,473 --> 01:08:50,534
[SPEAKER_21]: And just two quick notes.

690
01:08:50,954 --> 01:08:58,277
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't believe we're proposing to change anything related to parking around this Salem Street quarter rezoning.

691
01:08:58,337 --> 01:08:58,897
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that correct?

692
01:09:01,081 --> 01:09:01,401
[SPEAKER_13]: Emily.

693
01:09:02,562 --> 01:09:03,483
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

694
01:09:03,643 --> 01:09:12,811
[SPEAKER_13]: At this point, I do want to recognize that at this point, there are no parking requirements proposed to be changed.

695
01:09:13,492 --> 01:09:23,120
[SPEAKER_13]: It is true that we have been asked by city council to look at parking, that will be later this spring, but because we have not looked at it yet, we don't actually know what the results of that would be, so.

696
01:09:23,140 --> 01:09:26,463
[SPEAKER_13]: And that would be a completely separate process.

697
01:09:27,099 --> 01:09:32,583
[SPEAKER_13]: That's that that's part of this process, but it is not something that we're talking about now.

698
01:09:32,603 --> 01:09:35,706
[SPEAKER_13]: I without having looked at it.

699
01:09:35,766 --> 01:09:37,968
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't know which direction we would go in at this point.

700
01:09:38,108 --> 01:09:41,451
[SPEAKER_13]: So, but at this point, they are unchanged.

701
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:50,498
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so further on, you know, as a separate topic, if people want to get involved, you know, I would encourage them to reach out to.

702
01:09:51,305 --> 01:09:54,447
[SPEAKER_21]: You know their their city representation, the planning department.

703
01:09:55,348 --> 01:10:01,932
[SPEAKER_21]: And we've heard your comments in terms of, you know, this stuff can be communicated better so I think there's a lot of lessons learned there as well.

704
01:10:02,860 --> 01:10:06,002
[SPEAKER_21]: And then there's been some talk about specific uses.

705
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:22,875
[SPEAKER_21]: I understood that specific uses, like methadone clinics, could not be specifically discriminated, might not be the right word, but those could not specifically be called out as disallowed uses.

706
01:10:25,437 --> 01:10:26,058
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that correct?

707
01:10:26,698 --> 01:10:27,499
[SPEAKER_13]: That is correct.

708
01:10:28,459 --> 01:10:30,181
[SPEAKER_21]: We're doing as much as we can to

709
01:10:31,595 --> 01:10:38,845
[SPEAKER_21]: basically legally reduce the chance that a methadone clinic would locate.

710
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:46,427
[SPEAKER_13]: you are allowed to put restrictions on the conditions on the use, essentially.

711
01:10:46,487 --> 01:11:06,478
[SPEAKER_13]: So in this case, it's hours of operations, number of employees, square footage, but you cannot disallow, if you are allowing medical uses in the area, you can't disallow that one, any one particular use, and that is under the American, my understanding from our legal counsel is that is under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

712
01:11:06,498 --> 01:11:09,020
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, that's some helpful context.

713
01:11:12,460 --> 01:11:15,062
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, Peter, do you have my next in line?

714
01:11:16,403 --> 01:11:17,885
[SPEAKER_17]: Next up is Miranda Briseño.

715
01:11:19,726 --> 01:11:20,387
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Miranda.

716
01:11:21,047 --> 01:11:22,829
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute shortly.

717
01:11:23,329 --> 01:11:25,351
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

718
01:11:27,793 --> 01:11:28,474
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, can you hear me?

719
01:11:32,237 --> 01:11:34,078
[SPEAKER_27]: Miranda Briseño to Taylor Street.

720
01:11:34,118 --> 01:11:35,800
[SPEAKER_27]: Also, thank you for saying my last name correctly.

721
01:11:36,933 --> 01:11:39,456
[SPEAKER_27]: I've been a renter here for six and a half years.

722
01:11:39,476 --> 01:11:41,738
[SPEAKER_27]: I love living in Medford and I love calling it home.

723
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:51,770
[SPEAKER_27]: The reality, however, is that as a renter who's currently trying to find an apartment that meets my changing needs, I'm finding it extremely difficult to find a suitable place that will allow me to stay in this place that I love.

724
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:58,014
[SPEAKER_27]: To that end, I'm disappointed to see the multi-use residential drop down from three to six units to one to three.

725
01:11:58,034 --> 01:12:07,402
[SPEAKER_27]: If we want Medford to be affordable and people to stay in Medford, we need to allow more housing to be built and implement other measures to ensure that rental and home prices stay affordable.

726
01:12:07,922 --> 01:12:15,648
[SPEAKER_27]: This also includes whether through zoning or another mechanism, removing parking requirements and minimums and supporting transit, pedestrian and cyclist infrastructure.

727
01:12:16,521 --> 01:12:29,072
[SPEAKER_27]: Additionally, limiting only specific businesses uses limits the city's ability to generate more tax revenue, particularly with relation to dispensaries and hotels.

728
01:12:29,272 --> 01:12:41,663
[SPEAKER_27]: I recognize that the siting of a dispensary is limited by the location of schools and other things, but dispensaries have unequivocally generated immense revenue for the Commonwealth and for the communities that have worked with cannabis companies to allow for their existence.

729
01:12:42,373 --> 01:12:49,696
[SPEAKER_27]: While they may not be appropriate on Salem Street, I implore this board and residents in the future to consider this as an important benefit of allowing more businesses to be allowed.

730
01:12:50,617 --> 01:13:02,942
[SPEAKER_27]: If we are truly committed to climate resiliency on all fronts, one of those is creating truly mixed-use areas where people can go to the grocery store, eat a meal with their friends, go to the doctor, or receive substance abuse disorder treatment.

731
01:13:03,382 --> 01:13:07,364
[SPEAKER_27]: When we force these uses to be so far away from each other, we are forcing our neighbors to rely on cars,

732
01:13:08,024 --> 01:13:13,708
[SPEAKER_27]: or if they have no access to a car to simply go without access to necessary destination, which will be detrimental.

733
01:13:14,669 --> 01:13:23,536
[SPEAKER_27]: I hope to see more opportunities for housing to be built with less parking allowed, more medical offices and more businesses to come to Medford and future zoning proposals for areas across Medford.

734
01:13:24,136 --> 01:13:27,239
[SPEAKER_27]: Lastly, thank you to the board and to Inez Associates.

735
01:13:27,279 --> 01:13:30,301
[SPEAKER_27]: I know this work is not easy and I thank you all for the work that you do.

736
01:13:32,023 --> 01:13:35,866
[SPEAKER_21]: And likewise, we thank you, Miranda, for showing up, providing comment and feedback.

737
01:13:36,467 --> 01:13:41,310
[SPEAKER_21]: And as a fellow renter, yeah, I empathize with you.

738
01:13:46,254 --> 01:13:48,256
[SPEAKER_24]: The next name is Roberta Cameron.

739
01:13:49,797 --> 01:13:53,720
[SPEAKER_21]: Roberta, you are going to get a request to unmute.

740
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,722
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

741
01:13:58,513 --> 01:14:00,114
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, this is Roberta Cameron.

742
01:14:01,174 --> 01:14:03,675
[SPEAKER_05]: My address is 12 North Street.

743
01:14:04,615 --> 01:14:19,060
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted to thank you all for the process that you have gone through to develop this draft zoning and the community discussion that's happened up to now.

744
01:14:19,901 --> 01:14:24,862
[SPEAKER_05]: I am strongly in favor of zoning that is going to

745
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:44,771
[SPEAKER_05]: bring the city into the 21st century and enable more housing development and more opportunity for investment in properties by making more of the uses that we're accustomed to living around be allowable by

746
01:14:47,673 --> 01:14:58,241
[SPEAKER_05]: Under the current zoning and I echo a lot of what some of the people have said on this call earlier and that I'd like to see more.

747
01:15:01,348 --> 01:15:04,470
[SPEAKER_05]: more opportunities for housing development.

748
01:15:04,830 --> 01:15:26,602
[SPEAKER_05]: And I support the zoning as it is, but I would love to see some of the proposed density, which is really appropriately a step above what is there now be included in the zoning that's proposed.

749
01:15:27,122 --> 01:15:27,842
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

750
01:15:28,102 --> 01:15:28,403
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye bye.

751
01:15:30,124 --> 01:15:30,784
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Roberta.

752
01:15:32,065 --> 01:15:35,930
[SPEAKER_24]: The next person is Chris Briota.

753
01:15:35,950 --> 01:15:37,713
[SPEAKER_24]: Great.

754
01:15:40,297 --> 01:15:42,380
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Chris, please state your name and address for the record.

755
01:15:43,007 --> 01:15:44,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Chair, my name is Chris Priota.

756
01:15:44,188 --> 01:15:46,429
[SPEAKER_04]: I live at 20 Mystic River Road in Medford.

757
01:15:47,329 --> 01:15:50,310
[SPEAKER_04]: I originally came here to say that I'm in favor of upzoning.

758
01:15:50,710 --> 01:15:55,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a lot of the other callers, I'm disappointed in how watered down this plan has become.

759
01:15:55,893 --> 01:16:00,775
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand it was due to public comment, which is unfortunate.

760
01:16:01,155 --> 01:16:04,717
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess I'm here to speak in favor of what had been and what can be

761
01:16:06,736 --> 01:16:08,879
[SPEAKER_04]: resurrected in this project.

762
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:14,608
[SPEAKER_04]: We need housing and we need public transit in this city and across the region and that means density.

763
01:16:15,389 --> 01:16:22,019
[SPEAKER_04]: In addition to that Medford's been getting by on an austerity budget for way too long, earnest up zoning that brings that density

764
01:16:22,439 --> 01:16:28,644
[SPEAKER_04]: and everything that comes with it will help bring in new property tax, make it easier for commercial property to amplify those funds.

765
01:16:29,525 --> 01:16:40,054
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll add that if our parking minimums are getting in the way of these goals, then I'd urge this board to do what it needs to do to get those reconsidered at some point in the future.

766
01:16:40,114 --> 01:16:40,495
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

767
01:16:42,456 --> 01:16:42,937
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Chris.

768
01:16:44,867 --> 01:16:51,112
[SPEAKER_21]: And yeah, we're seeing some interesting approaches to parking minimums in area communities.

769
01:16:51,212 --> 01:17:01,041
[SPEAKER_21]: So those may provide interesting case studies for us, recognizing that Medford is not Somerville, Medford is not Cambridge, but we can learn from what's happening with our neighbors.

770
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:03,543
[SPEAKER_21]: Who's next?

771
01:17:05,204 --> 01:17:07,286
[SPEAKER_21]: Next is Ken Garrow.

772
01:17:08,908 --> 01:17:10,329
[SPEAKER_21]: Just state your name and address for the record.

773
01:17:11,194 --> 01:17:11,594
[SPEAKER_32]: evening.

774
01:17:11,934 --> 01:17:14,816
[SPEAKER_32]: Ken Yarrow, 52 Lambert Street, apartment three.

775
01:17:16,236 --> 01:17:21,418
[SPEAKER_32]: Also a resident of the corridor, I can see Salem Street from my living room window.

776
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:24,100
[SPEAKER_32]: Got a wonderful view of the Target.

777
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:29,762
[SPEAKER_32]: By and large, I do truly support the majority of these changes.

778
01:17:29,782 --> 01:17:31,583
[SPEAKER_32]: I've been paying attention for

779
01:17:33,364 --> 01:17:38,106
[SPEAKER_32]: several weeks now, mostly sending emails and kind of having external chats.

780
01:17:39,647 --> 01:17:43,870
[SPEAKER_32]: Went to the Roberts event, considering the amount of aggression that was at that event.

781
01:17:44,010 --> 01:17:51,394
[SPEAKER_32]: I think, Emily, you've done a fantastic job listening and digesting a lot of the commentary that was given there.

782
01:17:54,707 --> 01:17:57,469
[SPEAKER_32]: I, while I was at that event, I actually kept quiet.

783
01:17:57,609 --> 01:18:00,931
[SPEAKER_32]: I am pro clinics happening in the area.

784
01:18:01,131 --> 01:18:03,752
[SPEAKER_32]: I'm not that old.

785
01:18:04,273 --> 01:18:11,777
[SPEAKER_32]: I can foresee a future where I would much rather be able to walk down the street to any of these places.

786
01:18:11,797 --> 01:18:15,699
[SPEAKER_32]: I would be happy that it's being kept in MX2.

787
01:18:15,719 --> 01:18:18,181
[SPEAKER_32]: That's basically exactly where I live at the moment.

788
01:18:20,962 --> 01:18:26,746
[SPEAKER_32]: understand people's concerns about the methadone clinic, and I understand the city's concern about legal problems.

789
01:18:28,407 --> 01:18:36,733
[SPEAKER_32]: I think one way to combat that would maybe slightly tweak the hours of the definition from 8 a.m.

790
01:18:36,813 --> 01:18:38,214
[SPEAKER_32]: to 9 a.m.

791
01:18:38,675 --> 01:18:45,099
[SPEAKER_32]: I think that, given what I understand of how clinics operate, would help assuage some of the population.

792
01:18:47,701 --> 01:18:54,326
[SPEAKER_32]: In general, I just also want to say really quickly, was hoping that maybe we could reduce the size of the sidewalks.

793
01:18:54,426 --> 01:18:55,326
[SPEAKER_32]: I love walkability.

794
01:18:55,346 --> 01:18:57,148
[SPEAKER_32]: I walked to the square earlier today.

795
01:18:57,168 --> 01:19:01,090
[SPEAKER_32]: 12 feet seems a little massive in my opinion.

796
01:19:01,390 --> 01:19:06,554
[SPEAKER_32]: If we could shrink it down to something more like 8 feet for right away, I think that would be nice for permeability.

797
01:19:08,616 --> 01:19:15,242
[SPEAKER_32]: I would love the incentives to be a percentage of the lot minimum instead of a flat value.

798
01:19:15,342 --> 01:19:17,344
[SPEAKER_32]: Currently it's at 300 square feet.

799
01:19:18,805 --> 01:19:22,669
[SPEAKER_32]: Also, I have to say that I live in, again, one of the triple-deckers.

800
01:19:22,849 --> 01:19:27,514
[SPEAKER_32]: It is a 3,200 square foot lot with three units.

801
01:19:28,955 --> 01:19:32,138
[SPEAKER_32]: I have never had better community while living in this

802
01:19:33,099 --> 01:19:35,040
[SPEAKER_32]: situation and I've lived in West Medford.

803
01:19:35,060 --> 01:19:46,705
[SPEAKER_32]: I've lived just south of the square and here for five years so it's I understand why some people are weirded out by it but personally I love it and I look forward to living here for several more years.

804
01:19:49,834 --> 01:19:50,334
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks, Ken.

805
01:19:50,494 --> 01:19:53,635
[SPEAKER_21]: And thanks for sharing your lived experience in terms of the lot size and the units.

806
01:19:53,695 --> 01:19:55,235
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that's helpful context.

807
01:19:55,595 --> 01:19:58,996
[SPEAKER_21]: We all see triple deckers all throughout the area.

808
01:19:59,016 --> 01:20:05,598
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think it's helpful to realize that that may align with some of the changes that are being proposed now.

809
01:20:05,618 --> 01:20:09,499
[SPEAKER_24]: Next is Caitlin.

810
01:20:11,179 --> 01:20:11,739
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Caitlin.

811
01:20:11,860 --> 01:20:13,580
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

812
01:20:14,397 --> 01:20:17,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm Caitlin Robinson at 31 Everett Street.

813
01:20:18,339 --> 01:20:25,162
[SPEAKER_02]: And first of all, I want to say thank you to this board and to Enos Associates for all the thoughtfulness and work that's been going into this.

814
01:20:26,062 --> 01:20:33,506
[SPEAKER_02]: I am a resident of this neighborhood, and it's precisely for that reason that I am in support of rezoning and densification.

815
01:20:34,820 --> 01:20:46,669
[SPEAKER_02]: The current built environment here, with gas stations, automotive service, drive-thrus, service parking lots, doesn't really send the message that this is a neighborhood, but rather a place to drive through.

816
01:20:46,689 --> 01:20:55,336
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm in support of zoning that will make this feel more like a neighborhood with more neighbors, more businesses, increased walkability.

817
01:20:55,356 --> 01:21:03,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also a parent, and my child is too young right now, but when they are ready to leave the house,

818
01:21:04,062 --> 01:21:06,563
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want them to be forced out of their community.

819
01:21:07,103 --> 01:21:07,963
[SPEAKER_02]: We need more housing.

820
01:21:10,244 --> 01:21:23,669
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have concern about the parking minimums, both because of the negative impacts on the ability to increase density and because of the impacts that it has on price.

821
01:21:25,812 --> 01:21:30,575
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope that we can look at eliminating those parking minimums.

822
01:21:30,715 --> 01:21:34,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I am in support of the city regulating public parking.

823
01:21:35,738 --> 01:21:44,624
[SPEAKER_02]: But if my family needs access to a bus and we want to live somewhere where there's a bus and we don't need empty parking spaces, the city shouldn't be forcing us to have those.

824
01:21:45,884 --> 01:21:48,586
[SPEAKER_02]: People who have cars have many more options for where to live.

825
01:21:48,786 --> 01:21:54,510
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would like to see us have the options of having housing where people can make

826
01:21:56,051 --> 01:21:56,711
[SPEAKER_02]: for themselves.

827
01:21:57,231 --> 01:22:02,315
[SPEAKER_02]: I, too, am disappointed about the rollback in density in tonight's proposal.

828
01:22:03,315 --> 01:22:13,301
[SPEAKER_02]: I would rather see at least a minimum of four feet being allowed, sorry, four stories throughout the Salem Street corridor.

829
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:16,903
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope we can look at having more density.

830
01:22:17,124 --> 01:22:17,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

831
01:22:19,225 --> 01:22:19,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Caitlin.

832
01:22:23,347 --> 01:22:24,068
[SPEAKER_24]: Next speaker is

833
01:22:24,775 --> 01:22:25,876
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, Dave McKenna.

834
01:22:27,256 --> 01:22:32,538
[SPEAKER_21]: And just to quickly reiterate, we're not revisiting parking minimums, uh, this evening.

835
01:22:32,999 --> 01:22:39,141
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, but I, Caitlin, I do appreciate your comments, um, and we'll, you know, keep them in mind when that topic comes up.

836
01:22:39,181 --> 01:22:42,623
[SPEAKER_21]: And I encourage you to, to come back, um, and provide more comment.

837
01:22:43,763 --> 01:22:50,246
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh, when we do talk about parking minimums, uh, Dave McKenna, that's who's next.

838
01:22:50,986 --> 01:22:51,186
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

839
01:22:51,706 --> 01:22:53,147
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

840
01:22:54,888 --> 01:22:58,849
[SPEAKER_36]: David McKenna to Vine Street, also in the neighborhood.

841
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:03,691
[SPEAKER_36]: I'm also, like several other commenters, very disappointed.

842
01:23:04,131 --> 01:23:07,112
[SPEAKER_36]: I was a big supporter of the proposal in January.

843
01:23:07,132 --> 01:23:12,914
[SPEAKER_36]: I thought it was a very moderate increase in density in the neighborhood.

844
01:23:13,174 --> 01:23:16,535
[SPEAKER_36]: And so I understand there was a lot of comments.

845
01:23:16,655 --> 01:23:17,855
[SPEAKER_36]: I was at the February meeting.

846
01:23:18,115 --> 01:23:21,756
[SPEAKER_36]: I think the comments at the February meeting were not representative of the community.

847
01:23:21,796 --> 01:23:24,257
[SPEAKER_36]: And I'll send an email to explain why that was.

848
01:23:25,258 --> 01:23:35,105
[SPEAKER_36]: Um, you know, one thing that we've heard tonight is the, uh, the residential really needs to be increased back up to three to six units.

849
01:23:36,026 --> 01:23:39,308
[SPEAKER_36]: Um, that does not add any height that, you know, some people are concerned about heights.

850
01:23:40,089 --> 01:23:48,415
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, that's just, if the lot allows, then that allows flexibility to the developer to add more, more apartments because we desperately need more house.

851
01:23:48,595 --> 01:23:48,695
[SPEAKER_36]: So.

852
01:23:49,675 --> 01:23:51,336
[SPEAKER_36]: I support the medical uses.

853
01:23:52,396 --> 01:23:58,478
[SPEAKER_36]: I understand the compromise that was reached, and so I support that compromise to allow the medical where the target is basically.

854
01:24:01,119 --> 01:24:11,403
[SPEAKER_36]: On traffic, there's been a lot of concerns voiced about traffic, but the 101 bus is doubling in service on commuting times and quadrupling in service on the weekends.

855
01:24:11,543 --> 01:24:12,123
[SPEAKER_36]: That's coming.

856
01:24:12,384 --> 01:24:13,884
[SPEAKER_36]: The MBTA has planned that.

857
01:24:14,504 --> 01:24:18,686
[SPEAKER_36]: It's also being rerouted so that it hits the orange line, green line, and red line.

858
01:24:19,428 --> 01:24:24,211
[SPEAKER_36]: So there's going to be a dramatic increase in transit access in this neighborhood in the next five years.

859
01:24:24,792 --> 01:24:27,073
[SPEAKER_36]: And so our zoning should take that into account.

860
01:24:29,035 --> 01:24:40,803
[SPEAKER_36]: Furthermore, any development of any significant size is going to have to do traffic studies and pay traffic impact fees, pay sewer impact fees, and soon they'll have to pay affordable housing impact fees.

861
01:24:41,503 --> 01:24:47,247
[SPEAKER_36]: So those fees can help other measures that will reduce traffic, improve the streetscape,

862
01:24:49,146 --> 01:24:52,569
[SPEAKER_36]: you know, one idea would be, uh, some of this new tax revenue that's coming in.

863
01:24:52,589 --> 01:24:54,851
[SPEAKER_36]: We could really expand the school buses right now.

864
01:24:54,891 --> 01:24:58,174
[SPEAKER_36]: Most, most families in Medford are not served by the school buses.

865
01:24:58,194 --> 01:25:03,158
[SPEAKER_36]: You know, all the families in our neighborhood are too close to the schools allegedly to get the school bus.

866
01:25:03,758 --> 01:25:09,003
[SPEAKER_36]: Um, and so, uh, I think these concerns can be addressed.

867
01:25:09,623 --> 01:25:16,990
[SPEAKER_36]: Uh, and the last thing I'll say is, uh, on the Heights, there's already buildings in the neighborhood that are taller than these Heights that are being proposed.

868
01:25:17,050 --> 01:25:17,170
[SPEAKER_36]: So,

869
01:25:17,628 --> 01:25:26,830
[SPEAKER_36]: I understand people get scared about proposed heights, but there's already apartments on the corner of Salem and Fellsway that are taller than any of these proposals.

870
01:25:27,530 --> 01:25:31,611
[SPEAKER_36]: The Franklin School on Central Ave.

871
01:25:32,591 --> 01:25:40,732
[SPEAKER_36]: Yes, the Franklin School on Central Ave., the Swan School on Park Street are already taller than a lot of these proposals.

872
01:25:40,792 --> 01:25:43,193
[SPEAKER_36]: And so people get nervous about the heights, but

873
01:25:43,861 --> 01:25:44,662
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm so sorry, Dave.

874
01:25:44,682 --> 01:25:46,103
[SPEAKER_21]: You've gone 45 seconds over.

875
01:25:46,123 --> 01:25:49,806
[SPEAKER_21]: If you have additional comments, I'd encourage you to send them to the board.

876
01:25:50,347 --> 01:25:53,569
[SPEAKER_21]: But just in fairness for the rest of the public, we're going to move on.

877
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:56,312
[SPEAKER_21]: But I do appreciate you coming, you sharing your input.

878
01:25:58,473 --> 01:25:59,134
[SPEAKER_21]: Keep coming back.

879
01:26:00,795 --> 01:26:01,596
[SPEAKER_21]: Who's next, Danielle?

880
01:26:03,297 --> 01:26:04,398
[SPEAKER_21]: Tara Shankar.

881
01:26:04,418 --> 01:26:06,860
[SPEAKER_21]: Hi, Tara.

882
01:26:06,881 --> 01:26:08,822
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

883
01:26:10,343 --> 01:26:10,764
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

884
01:26:11,544 --> 01:26:12,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hear me?

885
01:26:12,548 --> 01:26:12,788
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

886
01:26:13,409 --> 01:26:13,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

887
01:26:14,290 --> 01:26:15,271
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Tara Shanker.

888
01:26:15,391 --> 01:26:22,898
[SPEAKER_09]: I live at 397 High Street, right in the heart of West Medford and I can't wait for the zoning regulations to come here.

889
01:26:22,918 --> 01:26:32,466
[SPEAKER_09]: I am strongly in support of densification and strongly in support of what was the original intent on Salem Street.

890
01:26:33,287 --> 01:26:45,352
[SPEAKER_09]: I also wanted to agree with many of the other callers that I am disappointed that the MR1 was walked back from three to six units to one to three, assuming greater bus service by the 101.

891
01:26:45,552 --> 01:26:59,558
[SPEAKER_09]: And I also would love if the parking regulations would be reviewed from 1.5 to two spaces per unit for studios and one bedrooms that would be in a three to six

892
01:27:00,238 --> 01:27:06,344
[SPEAKER_09]: type of building having one and a half to two spaces is ridiculous.

893
01:27:07,525 --> 01:27:22,398
[SPEAKER_09]: And people should be able to, it could be incentivized through electric bike or car rental access within the building or nearby, but there could be several different kinds of incentives that could be proposed.

894
01:27:23,098 --> 01:27:23,998
[SPEAKER_09]: to make that happen.

895
01:27:24,759 --> 01:27:34,301
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also really in favor and delighted to see that it remains the co-housing and congregate housing options are still in the measure, happy to see that.

896
01:27:38,042 --> 01:27:47,105
[SPEAKER_09]: We have a lot of medical buildings over here in West Medford right next to me, so and that's across from the elementary school, the Brooks

897
01:27:47,943 --> 01:27:51,545
[SPEAKER_09]: So I guess that's already permitted for us.

898
01:27:51,625 --> 01:27:55,848
[SPEAKER_09]: And the methadone clinics, I suppose, could be here if they chose to locate, but they haven't.

899
01:27:59,970 --> 01:28:05,334
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm delighted that the commercial uses that have been non-conforming are being made conforming.

900
01:28:05,574 --> 01:28:09,936
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a big supporter of the Greb Cafe and the Bubble Tea Place.

901
01:28:10,237 --> 01:28:10,577
[SPEAKER_09]: Love it.

902
01:28:13,013 --> 01:28:17,576
[SPEAKER_09]: I would love to see that the service stations and gas stations are not permitted.

903
01:28:17,596 --> 01:28:19,797
[SPEAKER_09]: I wasn't certain if that was the case.

904
01:28:22,018 --> 01:28:25,480
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you to the board and to Innes Associates.

905
01:28:26,401 --> 01:28:29,162
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you to you for providing your comments and your feedback.

906
01:28:31,784 --> 01:28:34,465
[SPEAKER_21]: Next is Patricia Ciappelli.

907
01:28:35,306 --> 01:28:39,108
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, Patricia, please state your name and address for the record.

908
01:28:40,666 --> 01:28:44,648
[SPEAKER_10]: My name is Patricia Ciapelli, 53 Garfield Avenue.

909
01:28:44,668 --> 01:28:49,569
[SPEAKER_10]: So it seems like we've missed a lot of the process.

910
01:28:49,749 --> 01:28:53,251
[SPEAKER_10]: One community meeting does not a community outreach make.

911
01:28:53,571 --> 01:29:04,395
[SPEAKER_10]: I appreciate the fact that you've walked back so much of the units because this is already according to the GIS map and environmental justice neighborhood.

912
01:29:04,835 --> 01:29:07,356
[SPEAKER_10]: The map already has us in a very hot,

913
01:29:07,576 --> 01:29:08,657
[SPEAKER_10]: dense zone.

914
01:29:08,817 --> 01:29:10,479
[SPEAKER_10]: It's mostly yellow and red.

915
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:22,590
[SPEAKER_10]: If you look at that GIS map, we have 980 residents that are against and have signed a petition not to move forward with the Salem zoning the way that it was.

916
01:29:23,250 --> 01:29:27,374
[SPEAKER_10]: There still is a lot of work that needs to be done, but I appreciate what you've done.

917
01:29:28,014 --> 01:29:36,537
[SPEAKER_10]: However, until there's, I agree that some of the other density needs to be taking place, but let's try it in other areas of Medford.

918
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:39,638
[SPEAKER_10]: This is already a death trap for walking.

919
01:29:39,918 --> 01:29:42,719
[SPEAKER_10]: I have lived here since 2013 and there have been three deaths.

920
01:29:45,220 --> 01:29:49,023
[SPEAKER_10]: Salem Street is one of the hottest corridors for walking.

921
01:29:49,083 --> 01:29:54,128
[SPEAKER_10]: So if people think they're going to go out there and walk and not take their life in their hands, guess again.

922
01:29:54,528 --> 01:30:02,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I have been with one of those people that died on a Saturday night because I heard the accident and I came off my porch to go help the lady.

923
01:30:02,695 --> 01:30:03,356
[SPEAKER_10]: It was horrible.

924
01:30:03,996 --> 01:30:05,737
[SPEAKER_10]: And we just had another one the other night.

925
01:30:05,857 --> 01:30:08,239
[SPEAKER_10]: So you need to do some research.

926
01:30:08,299 --> 01:30:11,622
[SPEAKER_10]: You need to understand what the traffic is that goes up and down this.

927
01:30:12,362 --> 01:30:17,085
[SPEAKER_10]: And you need to follow the comprehensive plan that you've set for the city already in place.

928
01:30:18,066 --> 01:30:25,051
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, you're going to have 980 very upset homeowners, taxpayers and voters.

929
01:30:26,232 --> 01:30:26,472
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

930
01:30:28,173 --> 01:30:29,034
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Patricia.

931
01:30:29,554 --> 01:30:30,515
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate the input.

932
01:30:33,568 --> 01:30:34,531
[SPEAKER_24]: Next is Rebecca.

933
01:30:35,655 --> 01:30:37,782
[SPEAKER_21]: Rebecca, please state your name and address for the record.

934
01:30:38,549 --> 01:30:41,390
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Rebecca Davidson, 26 Farragut Ave.

935
01:30:42,210 --> 01:30:49,033
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a resident of this neighborhood, the Salem Street neighborhood, and have been raising my family here for the last few years.

936
01:30:49,633 --> 01:30:53,014
[SPEAKER_12]: I also grew up in Medford, and I love this neighborhood.

937
01:30:53,094 --> 01:31:00,156
[SPEAKER_12]: And what I love most about it is my ability to walk to so many great businesses, hair salons, restaurants, and others.

938
01:31:00,276 --> 01:31:03,377
[SPEAKER_12]: Walkability is good for health, safety, and the environment.

939
01:31:03,838 --> 01:31:07,599
[SPEAKER_12]: And as previous speakers have said, we need to shift our habits like yesterday.

940
01:31:07,939 --> 01:31:09,260
[SPEAKER_12]: to tackle the climate crisis.

941
01:31:09,861 --> 01:31:15,906
[SPEAKER_12]: Zoning changes like this are so important in this neighborhood, especially since this is an environmental justice community.

942
01:31:16,346 --> 01:31:27,675
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, having walkable, close access to healthy food is really important, and a small grocery store or other healthy food outlet would be a great addition, which wouldn't be allowable without these changes.

943
01:31:28,496 --> 01:31:32,359
[SPEAKER_12]: When we moved here, I did some research to learn about the history of this incredible neighborhood.

944
01:31:33,260 --> 01:31:39,583
[SPEAKER_12]: In many ways, it was built with public transit in mind, as well as a tram station that used to exist on Washington Street.

945
01:31:40,064 --> 01:31:45,426
[SPEAKER_12]: At that time, there was a diversity of businesses that allowed people to not have to travel far to meet many of their needs.

946
01:31:45,847 --> 01:32:01,715
[SPEAKER_12]: We've moved towards a more car-dominated environment, and since then, and while I feel this proposal helps us move closer to the framework that created this great neighborhood than the previous version, it doesn't go anywhere near where we need to be to address our serious housing shortage.

947
01:32:02,115 --> 01:32:07,320
[SPEAKER_12]: It's too expensive to buy a home or rent a home, and the only way to address that is to build more homes.

948
01:32:07,860 --> 01:32:12,024
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really disappointing that our parking minimums get in the way of our housing goals.

949
01:32:12,565 --> 01:32:15,988
[SPEAKER_12]: I realize and share the traffic and safety concerns that have been raised.

950
01:32:16,408 --> 01:32:19,051
[SPEAKER_12]: These are not mutually exclusive with zoning changes.

951
01:32:19,431 --> 01:32:25,256
[SPEAKER_12]: We can have a thriving neighborhood and safe streets, and I'm advocating for that and hope my neighbors join me.

952
01:32:26,277 --> 01:32:28,938
[SPEAKER_12]: in advocating for better crosswalks and safer streets.

953
01:32:29,438 --> 01:32:32,459
[SPEAKER_12]: That's important now, but it's separate from this zoning proposal.

954
01:32:32,879 --> 01:32:38,461
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully, that's something good that comes from this process, is more community advocacy in this area.

955
01:32:38,741 --> 01:32:42,803
[SPEAKER_12]: There's a group, Walk Medford, that specifically is working on this that we can all support.

956
01:32:43,363 --> 01:32:55,607
[SPEAKER_12]: After being at the Roberts School session, I feel that a lot of the concerns that were raised have been addressed, but feel this proposal has shifted too far away from our goals of allowing more housing to be built to meet the needs of people in our community.

957
01:32:57,623 --> 01:32:57,963
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

958
01:32:59,424 --> 01:33:00,164
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Rebecca.

959
01:33:07,427 --> 01:33:11,269
[SPEAKER_24]: I lost my participant list.

960
01:33:11,789 --> 01:33:15,590
[SPEAKER_24]: The next person is Yuko Okabe.

961
01:33:16,991 --> 01:33:18,952
[SPEAKER_21]: Yuko, you're going to get a request to unmute.

962
01:33:19,552 --> 01:33:21,413
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

963
01:33:22,993 --> 01:33:24,675
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Yuko Okabe.

964
01:33:25,096 --> 01:33:29,140
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a resident of 55 Winchester Street, apartment two.

965
01:33:29,841 --> 01:33:40,392
[SPEAKER_00]: Just want to say that I am in support of updating the zoning and I'm speaking from affordability for Medford as a whole as far as also economic

966
01:33:40,492 --> 01:33:41,293
[SPEAKER_00]: growth as well.

967
01:33:42,314 --> 01:33:48,861
[SPEAKER_00]: New zoning allows new housing and it's an important step to solve the housing crisis and increase the supply of affordable housing.

968
01:33:48,881 --> 01:33:59,252
[SPEAKER_00]: I live with my partner in South Medford, our rent has been steadily going up for the past five years and we're looking forward to having those zoning conversations in South Medford as well.

969
01:34:00,293 --> 01:34:08,135
[SPEAKER_00]: Like others, I'm disappointed to hear the parking minimums and public comments have limited the amount of units in the neighborhood.

970
01:34:08,675 --> 01:34:13,956
[SPEAKER_00]: I regret that I wasn't part of earlier discussions and the last public hearing to advocate for more density.

971
01:34:13,976 --> 01:34:27,900
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that solving the housing crisis and building more affordable housing on a large scale starts from influencing our own neighborhood structure and building a community that supports our most basic rights of housing and security and supports our most vulnerable populations.

972
01:34:28,720 --> 01:34:36,643
[SPEAKER_00]: I support how the zoning supports the current local businesses and allows them to thrive and also supports new businesses to come in.

973
01:34:37,883 --> 01:34:46,507
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will then increase economic development in the city, I echo that I am also disappointed that banks have been prioritized over medical offices.

974
01:34:47,847 --> 01:34:57,069
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe in the 15 minute city where medical offices, parks, schools, my home, groceries, et cetera, are within that 15 minute commute.

975
01:34:57,389 --> 01:35:00,449
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see this as a public transit user and avid walker.

976
01:35:00,509 --> 01:35:01,750
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the 101 bus.

977
01:35:01,810 --> 01:35:02,270
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.

978
01:35:02,310 --> 01:35:04,010
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets me to all the places I like.

979
01:35:05,170 --> 01:35:13,272
[SPEAKER_00]: And to conclude, just want to thank the city and associates and the community members on this call for advocating on behalf of their communities.

980
01:35:13,572 --> 01:35:13,872
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

981
01:35:15,563 --> 01:35:16,123
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Yuko.

982
01:35:16,163 --> 01:35:17,324
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate you coming out.

983
01:35:21,627 --> 01:35:27,250
[SPEAKER_21]: I think you may have aligned, Danielle, if you want to take it back.

984
01:35:27,811 --> 01:35:28,031
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

985
01:35:28,351 --> 01:35:31,273
[SPEAKER_21]: Marshall, please state your name and address for the record.

986
01:35:31,973 --> 01:35:32,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hi.

987
01:35:32,894 --> 01:35:33,915
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Marshall Brown.

988
01:35:33,975 --> 01:35:36,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm out of 589 Riverside.

989
01:35:36,296 --> 01:35:40,239
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't really lived in Medford long, probably been renting a little bit over a year.

990
01:35:41,475 --> 01:35:45,230
[SPEAKER_08]: One thing that I did notice, I don't own a car, I can't drive.

991
01:35:47,552 --> 01:35:51,453
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's, you know, like Medford's a good place to live for that.

992
01:35:53,393 --> 01:36:05,116
[SPEAKER_08]: And I find that just places that have a lot of businesses and density and things to do are much more friendly for people who walk everywhere.

993
01:36:05,556 --> 01:36:12,618
[SPEAKER_08]: And so places like Salem Street that have like a lot of vibrant local businesses, there's honestly too many to name.

994
01:36:15,199 --> 01:36:16,819
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of the businesses by like Medford

995
01:36:17,980 --> 01:36:19,223
[SPEAKER_08]: kind of alongside that corridor.

996
01:36:19,844 --> 01:36:23,191
[SPEAKER_08]: And I find it really awful that it's kind of

997
01:36:25,172 --> 01:36:28,335
[SPEAKER_08]: flooded with traffic, really dangerous to walk.

998
01:36:29,455 --> 01:36:41,865
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it's strange not to consider the zoning in tandem with parking requirements because that's super important to the urban landscape.

999
01:36:41,885 --> 01:36:45,147
[SPEAKER_08]: And also the restriction on medical offices.

1000
01:36:46,989 --> 01:36:53,113
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand the concern with that, but I find that a lot of community members keep bringing up

1001
01:36:55,092 --> 01:36:56,414
[SPEAKER_08]: like methadone clinics.

1002
01:36:57,795 --> 01:37:05,484
[SPEAKER_08]: And it seems like that is a much bigger concern for people than having equitable access to health care.

1003
01:37:07,326 --> 01:37:14,192
[SPEAKER_08]: I found that it is hard to find a medical practitioner already, especially if you are mobility restricted.

1004
01:37:15,453 --> 01:37:23,980
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it'd be really nice to offer medical options for people who live in the area who would like easy access to that care.

1005
01:37:24,581 --> 01:37:30,065
[SPEAKER_08]: So I personally really don't like the emphasis on blocking that.

1006
01:37:31,486 --> 01:37:32,707
[SPEAKER_08]: But yeah, thank you so much.

1007
01:37:32,767 --> 01:37:34,809
[SPEAKER_08]: I do appreciate a lot of the zoning changes.

1008
01:37:36,790 --> 01:37:45,674
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Marshall appreciate you coming out and just to quickly check in on the medical office thing and Emily and pal if you can help me confirm it.

1009
01:37:46,054 --> 01:37:52,638
[SPEAKER_21]: I believe there are some medical uses that are permitted via community development board special permit.

1010
01:37:52,818 --> 01:37:53,418
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that correct?

1011
01:37:54,582 --> 01:38:05,031
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Madam Chair, so the neighborhood medical office is permitted for a special permit in the commercial and the MX2 district, it was removed from MX1.

1012
01:38:05,731 --> 01:38:19,783
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so similar to other special permit applications that we would consider, we would look at the benefits, we'd look at the downsides, and then we'd make a decision based on our kind of mandate as a development board.

1013
01:38:20,725 --> 01:38:23,689
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely, the special permit criteria that you have for those.

1014
01:38:23,709 --> 01:38:24,730
[SPEAKER_13]: That's correct.

1015
01:38:25,531 --> 01:38:26,251
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, great.

1016
01:38:26,412 --> 01:38:26,772
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1017
01:38:31,237 --> 01:38:34,961
[SPEAKER_21]: The next speaker that I have is JMN.

1018
01:38:35,422 --> 01:38:37,124
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1019
01:38:37,504 --> 01:38:39,507
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1020
01:38:54,753 --> 01:38:59,881
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not getting a response from JMN, so I'm going to move on to the next speaker and come back.

1021
01:39:00,622 --> 01:39:01,483
[SPEAKER_21]: Michael Dewberry.

1022
01:39:03,526 --> 01:39:05,449
[SPEAKER_21]: We're going to get a request to unmute.

1023
01:39:05,469 --> 01:39:07,071
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1024
01:39:07,091 --> 01:39:08,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everybody.

1025
01:39:08,893 --> 01:39:10,275
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael Dewberry, 50 Park Street.

1026
01:39:11,591 --> 01:39:12,091
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.

1027
01:39:12,652 --> 01:39:13,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a lot of great comments already.

1028
01:39:13,752 --> 01:39:16,353
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll try to focus on new things.

1029
01:39:17,454 --> 01:39:28,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, overall positive about the overall citywide zoning revamp, positive about the initial stab at the corridor.

1030
01:39:28,799 --> 01:39:33,261
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do appreciate the changes, like you're taking on community feedback.

1031
01:39:33,301 --> 01:39:35,302
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you did a good job of

1032
01:39:36,462 --> 01:39:36,903
[SPEAKER_01]: adjusting.

1033
01:39:38,063 --> 01:39:43,627
[SPEAKER_01]: I have not, this is my first public meeting I've attended in person, I have been following the discussion online.

1034
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:51,572
[SPEAKER_01]: I live about a block, a long block and a half from Salem Street, so I'm a user of the corridor.

1035
01:39:51,592 --> 01:39:56,435
[SPEAKER_01]: I am sensitive to the fact that I'm not impacted in the same way that people who live directly on Salem Street are.

1036
01:39:57,415 --> 01:40:07,757
[SPEAKER_01]: But overall, yeah, my sort of interest is, you know, I walk to the dentist, I walk to get a sandwich, walk to get coffee at the bike store, which is kind of weird.

1037
01:40:09,657 --> 01:40:11,918
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I'm also an all-mode user.

1038
01:40:12,558 --> 01:40:13,138
[SPEAKER_01]: We do exist.

1039
01:40:13,218 --> 01:40:15,298
[SPEAKER_01]: I do take the bus and bike and drive as well.

1040
01:40:15,818 --> 01:40:19,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Love to do more of the biking and busing and less of the driving.

1041
01:40:20,579 --> 01:40:21,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Very silent changes to the 101.

1042
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,480
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, so comments on

1043
01:40:27,700 --> 01:40:35,122
[SPEAKER_01]: From that perspective, I do feel like there's been an overcorrection in the density, especially around the Park and Salem Street intersection.

1044
01:40:35,142 --> 01:40:48,624
[SPEAKER_01]: I think by removing things from MX-1 and dropping from MX-2 and MX-1, it's been a pretty rapid drop in possibilities for that intersection, which does have a couple of empty lots.

1045
01:40:49,185 --> 01:40:50,725
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably going to develop pretty quickly.

1046
01:40:51,933 --> 01:40:57,439
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see more restaurants, entertainment options, food, groceries.

1047
01:40:59,301 --> 01:41:02,084
[SPEAKER_01]: On medical – oh, gosh, I'm going to run out of time.

1048
01:41:03,275 --> 01:41:04,876
[SPEAKER_01]: My issue with medical, I am pro-medical.

1049
01:41:05,317 --> 01:41:09,680
[SPEAKER_01]: My issue is that like we see in Medford Square, there's too much medical with no street engagement.

1050
01:41:10,221 --> 01:41:25,433
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to see maybe some ideas around, can we push out of the second floor, push it to the back of the building and not off the streets to have more concrete and enforceable rules about street engagement to keep the area vibrant.

1051
01:41:27,594 --> 01:41:28,916
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will save the rest of my comments for next time.

1052
01:41:28,956 --> 01:41:29,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1053
01:41:30,353 --> 01:41:30,953
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Michael.

1054
01:41:30,973 --> 01:41:34,516
[SPEAKER_21]: And you can also email your comments into the board, because we'll see those.

1055
01:41:35,437 --> 01:41:44,803
[SPEAKER_21]: But I like your comment about kind of active streets, and we want those to be active throughout various periods of the day, not just banking hours.

1056
01:41:46,924 --> 01:41:49,306
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that I have is Alyssa Nugent.

1057
01:41:49,806 --> 01:41:54,670
[SPEAKER_21]: Alyssa, you're going to get a request to unmute, and please state your name and address for the record.

1058
01:41:57,751 --> 01:42:00,553
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi, Alyssa Nugent, 98 Sheridan Avenue.

1059
01:42:02,034 --> 01:42:12,062
[SPEAKER_11]: I would like to thank the board and Innis for this presentation and for really taking into account the comments that have been made so far.

1060
01:42:14,985 --> 01:42:18,888
[SPEAKER_11]: It seems as though there's now been a look at feasibility for some of these lots.

1061
01:42:19,568 --> 01:42:22,311
[SPEAKER_11]: because we do have such small lots running along Salem.

1062
01:42:23,592 --> 01:42:34,641
[SPEAKER_11]: And as I believe Emily Ennis indicated, some of those lots, it would not even be possible to get to four feet or four stories, just because of the size.

1063
01:42:36,063 --> 01:42:39,787
[SPEAKER_11]: I do think that the feasibility of a 12 foot sidewalk needs to be looked at.

1064
01:42:39,807 --> 01:42:48,116
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm concerned about a sidewalk being that wide contributing to something like a concrete jungle and increasing heat.

1065
01:42:48,617 --> 01:42:51,980
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I know that grass running along the side of sidewalks isn't

1066
01:42:52,561 --> 01:42:55,162
[SPEAKER_11]: necessarily that great ecologically either.

1067
01:42:55,662 --> 01:43:06,585
[SPEAKER_11]: But in terms of making the neighborhood more walkable and feel friendlier, 12 feet wide sidewalks just seem to be too much for the area.

1068
01:43:07,125 --> 01:43:13,907
[SPEAKER_11]: I do worry that it would limit what is actually able to be built because it's going to eat up so much footage.

1069
01:43:15,288 --> 01:43:22,283
[SPEAKER_11]: of the private property and so developers won't want to build on these lots at all because

1070
01:43:23,372 --> 01:43:35,902
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, they have to make the building so much smaller in order to provide the city with six plus feet of sidewalk that isn't currently available on the public land.

1071
01:43:36,762 --> 01:43:38,924
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's my main comment.

1072
01:43:39,044 --> 01:43:39,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you again.

1073
01:43:39,625 --> 01:43:42,547
[SPEAKER_11]: And I guess I do have a question.

1074
01:43:42,567 --> 01:43:44,328
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, is it possible to waive the,

1075
01:43:45,469 --> 01:43:53,175
[SPEAKER_11]: are individual developers going to be able to go in front of CBD or somebody else to ask for a waiver on that requirement?

1076
01:43:53,215 --> 01:43:56,937
[SPEAKER_11]: Or is that like a hard requirement as it's currently written?

1077
01:43:59,699 --> 01:44:00,080
[SPEAKER_11]: That's all.

1078
01:44:00,120 --> 01:44:00,360
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks.

1079
01:44:01,060 --> 01:44:05,443
[SPEAKER_21]: Perfect timing, Alyssa.

1080
01:44:06,704 --> 01:44:14,530
[SPEAKER_21]: Daniela or Alicia or Emily, do you have a response to Alyssa's question about if developers are able to waive on a case-by-case basis?

1081
01:44:16,136 --> 01:44:20,379
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, Madam Chair, there is currently not a waiver.

1082
01:44:20,559 --> 01:44:21,560
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just double checking.

1083
01:44:23,001 --> 01:44:27,944
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't see a waiver at the moment for the 12 foot sidewalk.

1084
01:44:28,004 --> 01:44:30,306
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have waivers for a couple of other things.

1085
01:44:30,886 --> 01:44:34,729
[SPEAKER_13]: I do want to note, I think the previous speaker did allude to this, right?

1086
01:44:34,769 --> 01:44:41,093
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not the property owner, the developer is not creating the full 12 foot sidewalk.

1087
01:44:41,694 --> 01:44:43,275
[SPEAKER_13]: It's an additional bit of width.

1088
01:44:43,955 --> 01:44:50,465
[SPEAKER_13]: to the city sidewalk and there's a couple of reasons around that that distance.

1089
01:44:51,086 --> 01:44:57,655
[SPEAKER_13]: It does make it easier to plant trees along the street right trees need a certain amount of room to survive.

1090
01:44:59,057 --> 01:45:06,983
[SPEAKER_13]: and also to be able to have people going back and forth along the sidewalk without having to have too many people step aside, right?

1091
01:45:07,003 --> 01:45:12,047
[SPEAKER_13]: When we think of sidewalks, we want to be able to have friends talking together.

1092
01:45:12,167 --> 01:45:23,456
[SPEAKER_13]: We want to be able to have people who might be mobility impaired, and so they're using a wheelchair or a walker or something like that, and still have the sidewalk be comfortable for all users.

1093
01:45:24,016 --> 01:45:33,342
[SPEAKER_13]: still allow for things like benches, which are incredibly important for people who have mobility limitations and maybe need to rest on their way to the store.

1094
01:45:33,942 --> 01:45:36,924
[SPEAKER_13]: And that could be people of all ages and all capabilities.

1095
01:45:37,004 --> 01:45:39,105
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't have to be somebody who is permanently impaired.

1096
01:45:39,125 --> 01:45:43,308
[SPEAKER_13]: It could be somebody who's got a broken leg from ski season and wants a place to sit.

1097
01:45:43,688 --> 01:45:53,194
[SPEAKER_13]: So 12-foot sidewalk gives that ability to accommodate a number of users, accommodate the trees, accommodate the other street furniture, and that's why we're recommending it.

1098
01:45:54,414 --> 01:46:00,797
[SPEAKER_13]: If a waiver, so we do have some height waivers and we have a step back waiver.

1099
01:46:01,798 --> 01:46:10,222
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, if something like a sidewalk waiver is of interest, we could discuss it and try and figure out how that would work while still keeping a consistent environment.

1100
01:46:13,523 --> 01:46:15,364
[SPEAKER_21]: That's helpful context.

1101
01:46:16,285 --> 01:46:20,167
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I mean, we obviously, you know, anybody can become disabled at any point in their life.

1102
01:46:22,486 --> 01:46:38,700
[SPEAKER_21]: So that's something we definitely want to be aware of, but we also want to make sure that we're prioritizing people and density and housing and vibrant streets and a dynamic street section over some of those other topics.

1103
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:40,622
[SPEAKER_21]: So yeah, it's an interesting balance for sure.

1104
01:46:40,642 --> 01:46:41,843
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1105
01:46:43,984 --> 01:46:44,625
[SPEAKER_21]: A noodle on that.

1106
01:46:45,586 --> 01:46:47,908
[SPEAKER_21]: The next speaker that I see is Gary M.

1107
01:46:49,510 --> 01:46:51,451
[SPEAKER_21]: Gary, you're gonna get a request to unmute.

1108
01:46:51,891 --> 01:46:53,831
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1109
01:46:55,352 --> 01:46:56,892
[SPEAKER_31]: Good evening, Gary Marinelli.

1110
01:46:56,912 --> 01:47:02,014
[SPEAKER_31]: I live at 77 Parish Street, and I am a resident of this neighborhood.

1111
01:47:03,175 --> 01:47:08,496
[SPEAKER_31]: First, I wanna say I'm very happy that the city is looking at and proposing new zoning.

1112
01:47:08,636 --> 01:47:12,998
[SPEAKER_31]: I think this is long overdue, so I wanna thank everyone that is helping with the zoning.

1113
01:47:14,426 --> 01:47:17,527
[SPEAKER_31]: I also am happy that you're taking public feedback into account.

1114
01:47:18,327 --> 01:47:33,311
[SPEAKER_31]: However, like many others have stated, I was very pleased with the initial proposal and I'm a bit disappointed, honestly, in the lack of increase in density in the latest proposal and that the unit counts are decreasing.

1115
01:47:34,571 --> 01:47:39,793
[SPEAKER_31]: I prefer the density be increased back to three to six units or maybe somewhere in between.

1116
01:47:39,813 --> 01:47:43,354
[SPEAKER_31]: I think the one to three units is not moving forward as a city.

1117
01:47:44,972 --> 01:47:48,278
[SPEAKER_31]: We really need to plan for the future and build a better Medford.

1118
01:47:48,659 --> 01:47:50,542
[SPEAKER_31]: We should not stay stuck in the past.

1119
01:47:51,964 --> 01:47:56,191
[SPEAKER_31]: I see us moving backwards with the latest iteration.

1120
01:47:57,343 --> 01:48:03,349
[SPEAKER_31]: And as everyone has said, Medford has a lack of housing, and we really need to increase development.

1121
01:48:03,369 --> 01:48:16,363
[SPEAKER_31]: I'm all for supporting a neighborhood with more housing, more commercial, more restaurants, more entertainment options, and more things to do within a walking distance.

1122
01:48:17,719 --> 01:48:19,280
[SPEAKER_31]: You know, I want an active community.

1123
01:48:19,300 --> 01:48:28,588
[SPEAKER_31]: And again, without allowing us the potential to grow to more stories, we're not moving forward.

1124
01:48:28,608 --> 01:48:32,151
[SPEAKER_31]: It's kind of a significant overcorrection in the wrong direction.

1125
01:48:33,512 --> 01:48:39,536
[SPEAKER_31]: And we need to enable this additional housing to increase availability, increase revenue for the city.

1126
01:48:40,698 --> 01:48:42,759
[SPEAKER_31]: and draw more businesses to the area.

1127
01:48:42,939 --> 01:48:47,401
[SPEAKER_31]: More businesses are not going to move into the area if we don't allow density.

1128
01:48:49,722 --> 01:48:53,963
[SPEAKER_31]: And again, we need to transition to a more modern community and continue to grow.

1129
01:48:55,144 --> 01:48:59,245
[SPEAKER_31]: So I would just ask that that be revisited.

1130
01:48:59,445 --> 01:49:03,027
[SPEAKER_31]: But again, I really want to thank everyone for the work that they're doing here.

1131
01:49:04,647 --> 01:49:05,728
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Gary, for coming out.

1132
01:49:06,873 --> 01:49:08,114
[SPEAKER_21]: Appreciate your comments.

1133
01:49:09,135 --> 01:49:11,056
[SPEAKER_21]: The next speaker that I have is Ren Bean.

1134
01:49:12,677 --> 01:49:14,438
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1135
01:49:14,458 --> 01:49:18,401
[SPEAKER_35]: Hi there, Ren Bean, 37 Woodrow Avenue.

1136
01:49:20,602 --> 01:49:34,311
[SPEAKER_35]: I've been following this Salem Street development here for a minute, and I just want to lend my support to a lot of the commenters here today that have some concerns about the backstabbing from some of the density.

1137
01:49:35,412 --> 01:49:43,634
[SPEAKER_35]: You know, I, I do have concerns about about overall this being done deliberately and thoughtfully, which I think is generally the case.

1138
01:49:43,734 --> 01:49:51,897
[SPEAKER_35]: I think innocent city council and now the CDB has been really thoughtful and careful about not just charging head, but.

1139
01:49:52,897 --> 01:49:56,600
[SPEAKER_35]: being responsive to public feedback, and I hope that's the case for a lot of what you've heard tonight as well.

1140
01:49:57,802 --> 01:50:12,094
[SPEAKER_35]: But I think that limiting the number of units, especially with considering the small lot sizes and some of the other setbacks and so forth, it's really kind of saying that only a certain type of housing will be allowable, you know, kind of

1141
01:50:12,514 --> 01:50:20,318
[SPEAKER_35]: larger multi-bedroom units, which are great for certain types of renters and buyers, maybe families that need several bedrooms.

1142
01:50:20,378 --> 01:50:31,823
[SPEAKER_35]: But I just think Medford does have a really bad lack of smaller housing, single-bedroom studios for people that need more affordable housing, single individuals.

1143
01:50:33,404 --> 01:50:44,555
[SPEAKER_35]: Another thing I'd like to point out to a lot of the detractors of these proposals is that single individuals, six units on a lot, I mean, those folks are contributing a lot to the tax base.

1144
01:50:44,755 --> 01:50:48,879
[SPEAKER_35]: And I heard a lot of folks expressing that they're concerned about over-enrollment in the Roberts.

1145
01:50:48,939 --> 01:50:57,868
[SPEAKER_35]: I mean, having six single folks without kids contributing to the tax base and not enrolling kids in that neighborhood sounds like it's exactly what they would want.

1146
01:50:58,468 --> 01:51:09,738
[SPEAKER_35]: Um, but, uh, you know, let's let the, let's let the private market decide what's, what's feasible in terms of, uh, you know, development and not limit it to three when six would sell well.

1147
01:51:09,838 --> 01:51:11,639
[SPEAKER_35]: And there are residents that want and need that.

1148
01:51:11,739 --> 01:51:16,383
[SPEAKER_35]: And, uh, some of the other folks here said they would love to rent a place and not have to drive a car.

1149
01:51:16,764 --> 01:51:21,287
[SPEAKER_35]: Uh, and I agree with the other person who said, you know, studio doesn't need two parking spots.

1150
01:51:21,608 --> 01:51:22,949
[SPEAKER_35]: Uh, we can fit them in there.

1151
01:51:23,089 --> 01:51:25,691
[SPEAKER_35]: So anyway, uh, just hope that's considered.

1152
01:51:26,332 --> 01:51:26,532
[SPEAKER_35]: Thank you.

1153
01:51:27,732 --> 01:51:28,215
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks, Ren.

1154
01:51:28,235 --> 01:51:30,970
[SPEAKER_21]: Appreciate the comments.

1155
01:51:33,722 --> 01:51:38,766
[SPEAKER_21]: The next speaker that I have, JMN, you're going to get a request to unmute.

1156
01:51:38,786 --> 01:51:40,167
[SPEAKER_21]: Please say your name.

1157
01:51:40,187 --> 01:51:41,248
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you hear me now?

1158
01:51:41,268 --> 01:51:42,389
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, I can hear you.

1159
01:51:42,990 --> 01:51:43,410
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you.

1160
01:51:43,430 --> 01:51:44,471
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.

1161
01:51:44,491 --> 01:51:45,492
[SPEAKER_37]: I appreciate it.

1162
01:51:45,612 --> 01:51:47,994
[SPEAKER_37]: Jean Nuzzo, 35 Parris Street.

1163
01:51:48,154 --> 01:51:49,155
[SPEAKER_37]: I'm a direct abutter.

1164
01:51:49,515 --> 01:51:51,276
[SPEAKER_37]: I live in the heart of the Glenwood neighborhood.

1165
01:51:51,717 --> 01:51:55,400
[SPEAKER_37]: Yes, we are a neighborhood and we have been for decades, proudly so.

1166
01:51:55,420 --> 01:52:00,404
[SPEAKER_37]: I appreciate the work that's been undertaken to incorporate our modifications based on feedback presented.

1167
01:52:01,200 --> 01:52:05,721
[SPEAKER_37]: and the updates to the presentation, including selected language for consideration.

1168
01:52:06,501 --> 01:52:16,744
[SPEAKER_37]: In reviewing the most recent documents for Salem Street Tonight and the upcoming neighborhood zoning maps, I want to point out that there are discrepancies that persist across those documents, including parcels near mine.

1169
01:52:17,144 --> 01:52:25,466
[SPEAKER_37]: And therefore, I would highly recommend a widely available unified map that's thoughtfully colorized to assure accessibility and ease of interpretation for folks.

1170
01:52:25,887 --> 01:52:27,247
[SPEAKER_37]: There's a lot of yellows and oranges.

1171
01:52:27,907 --> 01:52:40,459
[SPEAKER_37]: In the absence of this map and observation of the above discrepancies, I find the need to again iterate that parcels alongside streets should not be included in the corridor zoning as they don't qualify elsewhere and shouldn't do so here either.

1172
01:52:41,542 --> 01:53:06,419
[SPEAKER_37]: I must say as an industry professional, the fact that we are on the precipice of voting this through to further densify and exacerbate the inequities and density in this area relative to the remainder of the city without even the most baseline of industry standard documents, such as existing condition analysis on infrastructure impact, constructability within proposed minimums, and not even the most rudimentary of an urban master plan is mind boggling.

1173
01:53:07,262 --> 01:53:20,870
[SPEAKER_37]: Truly, I think we must take a step back to move forward properly and ensure that we're following industry best practices that are guide rails to success and ensures that implementation doesn't gentrify out long-term residents that are currently affordably housed.

1174
01:53:21,370 --> 01:53:27,714
[SPEAKER_37]: You simply can't make accurate assessments or shape a clear image of the impact of these zoning changes without a comprehensive analysis.

1175
01:53:28,094 --> 01:53:35,298
[SPEAKER_37]: And the incremental studies, development by development, doesn't work relative to sweeping rezoning such as we're doing now, full stop.

1176
01:53:35,858 --> 01:53:41,299
[SPEAKER_37]: It's unbelievable to contemplate all this being moved along without these typical work products and in such short order.

1177
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:43,600
[SPEAKER_37]: Neighboring cities take years to do this.

1178
01:53:44,060 --> 01:53:53,043
[SPEAKER_37]: And speaking of neighboring cities, Cambridge, who just passed landmark zoning for four-story multifamily buy right, their lot size is 5,000 square feet.

1179
01:53:53,343 --> 01:53:54,963
[SPEAKER_37]: But here in Medford, we're looking at three.

1180
01:53:55,383 --> 01:53:59,244
[SPEAKER_37]: And that is their deeply educated baseline, 5,000 square feet.

1181
01:53:59,544 --> 01:54:00,765
[SPEAKER_37]: So it's amazing to me.

1182
01:54:01,065 --> 01:54:02,085
[SPEAKER_37]: I appreciate the time.

1183
01:54:03,205 --> 01:54:13,548
[SPEAKER_37]: And I hope that you will think about this because we have the neighborhood zoning coming next that will also deeply densify and has been iterated by other folks.

1184
01:54:14,229 --> 01:54:16,189
[SPEAKER_37]: Medford isn't going to solve the housing crisis.

1185
01:54:16,809 --> 01:54:17,650
[SPEAKER_21]: The goalposts keep moving.

1186
01:54:17,670 --> 01:54:19,850
[SPEAKER_37]: Can you wrap up in the next 10 seconds, please?

1187
01:54:19,870 --> 01:54:20,150
[SPEAKER_37]: Sure.

1188
01:54:20,370 --> 01:54:21,711
[SPEAKER_37]: The goalposts keep moving.

1189
01:54:22,351 --> 01:54:23,832
[SPEAKER_37]: It's a very complicated process.

1190
01:54:23,912 --> 01:54:31,054
[SPEAKER_37]: And please consider the quality of life for our neighborhood as well, because we are already more dense than other areas of the city.

1191
01:54:31,174 --> 01:54:31,754
[SPEAKER_37]: Thank you so much.

1192
01:54:32,915 --> 01:54:33,295
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1193
01:54:37,037 --> 01:54:40,059
[SPEAKER_21]: The next commenter that I see is Jennifer Sullivan.

1194
01:54:40,719 --> 01:54:43,100
[SPEAKER_21]: Jennifer, you're going to get a request to unmute.

1195
01:54:43,320 --> 01:54:45,882
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1196
01:54:46,610 --> 01:54:46,850
[SPEAKER_29]: Sure.

1197
01:54:47,070 --> 01:54:47,590
[SPEAKER_29]: Can you hear me?

1198
01:54:48,231 --> 01:54:48,451
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1199
01:54:49,091 --> 01:54:49,331
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1200
01:54:49,831 --> 01:54:52,252
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm Jen Sullivan, 35 Washington Street.

1201
01:54:52,793 --> 01:54:53,653
[SPEAKER_29]: I grew up in Medford.

1202
01:54:53,773 --> 01:54:54,974
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm a recent homeowner.

1203
01:54:55,454 --> 01:54:56,974
[SPEAKER_29]: I purchased off of Salem Street.

1204
01:54:58,255 --> 01:55:04,558
[SPEAKER_29]: While I'm disappointed on the watering down of this proposal, I do appreciate the effort and collaboration to at least get us to here today.

1205
01:55:06,298 --> 01:55:11,921
[SPEAKER_29]: Updating zoning helps our existing businesses grow and new ones join us also as a non-driver.

1206
01:55:12,421 --> 01:55:17,584
[SPEAKER_29]: And as a single resident, shout out Ren for pointing us out that we exist.

1207
01:55:18,905 --> 01:55:24,028
[SPEAKER_29]: As a non-driver, I share the prior mentioned safety concerns, but also agree that they're not exclusive to zoning.

1208
01:55:24,048 --> 01:55:31,071
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm a two-year member of a gym on Salem Street, and that and the walkability definitely guided my recent condo purchase.

1209
01:55:31,812 --> 01:55:33,113
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm investing in my hometown.

1210
01:55:34,133 --> 01:55:46,598
[SPEAKER_29]: And I really hope that everyone on this call who clearly care about our neighborhood, I hope we can move forward and work together and advocate for what we do want to see in our neighborhood instead of focusing on what we don't want.

1211
01:55:47,259 --> 01:55:47,579
[SPEAKER_29]: Thank you.

1212
01:55:49,579 --> 01:55:50,280
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Jennifer.

1213
01:55:50,700 --> 01:55:52,701
[SPEAKER_21]: And congratulations on your home purchase.

1214
01:55:52,721 --> 01:55:52,981
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

1215
01:55:58,193 --> 01:56:03,836
[SPEAKER_21]: Alicia or Danielle, have we received any comments about technical difficulties through the chat?

1216
01:56:05,237 --> 01:56:07,077
[SPEAKER_21]: Any emails through the email address?

1217
01:56:08,518 --> 01:56:15,021
[SPEAKER_22]: Madam Chair, Amanda is actually managing the emails for us tonight and the extra viewing room.

1218
01:56:16,542 --> 01:56:16,982
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, yes.

1219
01:56:18,283 --> 01:56:22,985
[SPEAKER_22]: And she was gonna raise her hand if any members of the viewing room wanted to speak.

1220
01:56:23,565 --> 01:56:23,845
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1221
01:56:24,166 --> 01:56:26,947
[SPEAKER_22]: So I think she's actually, she looks like she's offering them right now.

1222
01:56:29,007 --> 01:56:31,548
[SPEAKER_22]: Amanda, are you able to unmute yourself, or do I need to give that?

1223
01:56:31,729 --> 01:56:33,269
[SPEAKER_21]: I think we would need to unmute her.

1224
01:56:33,550 --> 01:56:34,130
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to.

1225
01:56:35,731 --> 01:56:35,971
[SPEAKER_22]: There.

1226
01:56:36,331 --> 01:56:37,912
[SPEAKER_22]: I just gave you co-host permissions.

1227
01:56:37,952 --> 01:56:38,893
[SPEAKER_22]: You can do it, Amanda.

1228
01:56:40,073 --> 01:56:40,173
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.

1229
01:56:40,494 --> 01:56:41,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you so much.

1230
01:56:42,355 --> 01:56:53,041
[SPEAKER_06]: So no comments live from the room, but I'll just quickly take a look at some notes from emails that were received over the past couple of days.

1231
01:56:55,222 --> 01:57:07,252
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we had, and I know it's sort of reductive to label things as supportive or against, but just for sake of kind of organizing things a little bit.

1232
01:57:08,252 --> 01:57:08,753
[SPEAKER_06]: We had 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.

1233
01:57:11,895 --> 01:57:19,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Eight emails, comments that we received over email that were generally supportive of the proposal.

1234
01:57:20,566 --> 01:57:28,815
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, does that we echo a lot of the sentiments we heard tonight about walkability, densification, more housing, more business.

1235
01:57:31,060 --> 01:57:38,242
[SPEAKER_06]: let's see, climate resiliency of the proposal and the way that densification can play into that.

1236
01:57:40,162 --> 01:57:58,586
[SPEAKER_06]: We also had one, two, five comments that leaned toward opposition and raised some concerns, nothing that wasn't already kind of spoken to tonight, but including things such as concerns around specific uses like medical offices, marijuana dispensary,

1237
01:57:59,286 --> 01:58:19,958
[SPEAKER_06]: Concerned around height along the corridor and the incentive zoning, the potential for creating congestion, traffic, concerns around hotel, dormitory, bed and breakfast uses, and concern around sufficient parking.

1238
01:58:21,718 --> 01:58:35,544
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that wraps sort of the email comments that we'd received within the past, I'd say maybe two weeks, but we got a slew that came in today and yesterday that were included in that.

1239
01:58:37,445 --> 01:58:41,247
[SPEAKER_21]: And those emails are also put in the board meeting folders.

1240
01:58:42,568 --> 01:58:43,268
[SPEAKER_06]: That is correct.

1241
01:58:43,948 --> 01:58:49,831
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been put into the meeting packets as well as the publicly viewable folders.

1242
01:58:50,633 --> 01:58:50,833
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

1243
01:58:51,674 --> 01:58:51,974
[SPEAKER_21]: Awesome.

1244
01:58:51,994 --> 01:58:52,875
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for that, Amanda.

1245
01:58:53,095 --> 01:58:53,815
[SPEAKER_21]: Nice to see you again.

1246
01:58:56,497 --> 01:59:00,380
[SPEAKER_21]: So with that, I don't see any new comments.

1247
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:07,065
[SPEAKER_21]: As a reminder, we have a two-minute limit for each commenter to provide one comment.

1248
01:59:07,765 --> 01:59:16,732
[SPEAKER_21]: I encourage everybody who would like to provide more input to email the email address, and I'll just reiterate that quickly.

1249
01:59:20,592 --> 01:59:21,212
[SPEAKER_21]: Where is it?

1250
01:59:23,293 --> 01:59:23,993
[SPEAKER_21]: I just had it.

1251
01:59:27,514 --> 01:59:32,595
[SPEAKER_21]: OCD at Medford dash ma dot gov.

1252
01:59:36,816 --> 01:59:39,256
[SPEAKER_21]: OK, and then I just saw a new hand, Lori.

1253
01:59:40,637 --> 01:59:42,537
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to get a request to unmute.

1254
01:59:44,057 --> 01:59:46,238
[SPEAKER_21]: Please state your name and address for the record.

1255
01:59:54,578 --> 01:59:56,499
[SPEAKER_21]: Lori, if you're speaking, I cannot hear you.

1256
01:59:56,519 --> 01:59:58,420
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to send another request to unmute.

1257
02:00:02,523 --> 02:00:04,804
[SPEAKER_21]: I saw you come off mute briefly and then go back on.

1258
02:00:08,346 --> 02:00:10,067
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm unfortunately not hearing anything.

1259
02:00:14,029 --> 02:00:14,630
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's see.

1260
02:00:18,312 --> 02:00:23,415
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd encourage you to reach out to Danielle or Alicia if you're having technical issues.

1261
02:00:27,035 --> 02:00:36,406
[SPEAKER_21]: And if you are having technical issues, you know, coordinate with Alicia and Danielle, and they may be able to share your comment on behalf of you.

1262
02:00:36,427 --> 02:00:39,030
[SPEAKER_21]: Let's give another minute.

1263
02:01:04,198 --> 02:01:07,339
[SPEAKER_21]: Danielle or Alicia, are you seeing a note come through from Lori?

1264
02:01:07,359 --> 02:01:10,460
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to make sure we hear their comment.

1265
02:01:11,601 --> 02:01:13,221
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I messaged her.

1266
02:01:13,901 --> 02:01:14,522
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

1267
02:01:15,122 --> 02:01:26,306
[SPEAKER_22]: And I'll just say it out loud that often if there's an arrow next to the mute button, and you can select a different microphone input, and that's often the problem.

1268
02:01:27,366 --> 02:01:29,307
[SPEAKER_22]: Other people just have to log out and back in.

1269
02:01:29,327 --> 02:01:29,367
[SPEAKER_22]: OK.

1270
02:01:32,683 --> 02:01:35,324
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, Lori, I encourage you to reach out to Danielle or Alicia.

1271
02:01:36,905 --> 02:01:40,106
[SPEAKER_21]: But as of right now, we're not seeing any new public commenters.

1272
02:01:41,127 --> 02:01:49,611
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'm going to go ahead and close the public comment period for this meeting and open it up to the board to discuss further revisions or recommendations.

1273
02:01:51,865 --> 02:01:53,066
[SPEAKER_21]: to the draft zoning.

1274
02:01:53,506 --> 02:02:02,450
[SPEAKER_21]: And I know Ari, you have to leave shortly, so I want to pass it off to you so you can get your thoughts in first.

1275
02:02:04,451 --> 02:02:12,795
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you to all the members of the public and to the consultants from Innes Associates.

1276
02:02:13,055 --> 02:02:15,476
[SPEAKER_19]: I really appreciate all the feedback.

1277
02:02:16,397 --> 02:02:17,877
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been reading all the emails.

1278
02:02:19,558 --> 02:02:30,845
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think it is clear that the feedback today is that we are not done, that this is an iteration that probably needs some more work.

1279
02:02:30,865 --> 02:02:42,713
[SPEAKER_19]: I had initially also been interested in moving maybe to the 1 to 4 units if we're not comfortable with going to 3 to 6 even in the same dimensions.

1280
02:02:42,933 --> 02:02:46,275
[SPEAKER_19]: I would have no objections to 3 to 6 in the same dimensions,

1281
02:02:48,709 --> 02:02:50,372
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's worth considering.

1282
02:02:50,392 --> 02:02:59,165
[SPEAKER_19]: I had mentioned earlier looking at kind of weighing the city's priorities among the incentive zoning.

1283
02:03:00,391 --> 02:03:12,014
[SPEAKER_19]: And my priorities, and I think the priorities among the community feedback consistently is around affordable housing and kind of affordable businesses.

1284
02:03:12,114 --> 02:03:18,716
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'd like those to be really prioritized and the incentives to prioritize that.

1285
02:03:20,016 --> 02:03:26,077
[SPEAKER_19]: This was only one or two comments, but I do share the frustration about the excess of banks.

1286
02:03:26,338 --> 02:03:26,898
[SPEAKER_19]: And I don't know,

1287
02:03:29,117 --> 02:03:37,083
[SPEAKER_19]: What argument, I mean, are we allowed to say we have a lot of banks approval needed?

1288
02:03:38,484 --> 02:03:45,169
[SPEAKER_19]: With most of the things that we're discussing, I like see the community harm or kind of community risk that make that obvious thing.

1289
02:03:45,189 --> 02:03:50,012
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, I understand good tenants, but a bit overrepresented in our neighborhood.

1290
02:03:53,419 --> 02:03:56,220
[SPEAKER_19]: had also been struck by the 12 foot sidewalks.

1291
02:03:56,600 --> 02:03:59,341
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we got a thorough answer from Innes Associates on that.

1292
02:04:00,701 --> 02:04:04,202
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'm curious about hearing more about existing condition analysis.

1293
02:04:04,762 --> 02:04:15,404
[SPEAKER_19]: I was kind of, I understand the argument about shadow and traffic studies needing to be done piece by piece, but I'd be curious in hearing from Innes Associates, their perspective on that.

1294
02:04:15,684 --> 02:04:17,945
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's, that's my notes.

1295
02:04:19,620 --> 02:04:23,731
[SPEAKER_21]: Emily and Paola, are you able to respond to board member Fishman?

1296
02:04:25,531 --> 02:04:38,178
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, certainly happy to on, and I think board member Fishman some of the comments about that you made about density will allow me to address some of the other comments that were made about just to do so.

1297
02:04:38,518 --> 02:04:39,859
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you for that opportunity.

1298
02:04:41,440 --> 02:04:50,345
[SPEAKER_13]: I spoke at the beginning that we are looking at the residential only areas throughout the city, we have been for the past two months.

1299
02:04:51,145 --> 02:05:03,253
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that might clarify some of our thinking about why we took the MR and made it closer to the NR3 rather than to the other possibility could have been, for example, the UR1.

1300
02:05:03,793 --> 02:05:07,536
[SPEAKER_13]: And for that, with your permission, I'm just going to quickly share my screen.

1301
02:05:07,556 --> 02:05:13,960
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I think visuals have been very helpful throughout this, so please feel free to pull stuff up.

1302
02:05:14,731 --> 02:05:15,251
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1303
02:05:15,351 --> 02:05:21,394
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is the map that we just discussed with the Planning and Permitting Committee last week.

1304
02:05:21,514 --> 02:05:23,195
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, last week, the 26th.

1305
02:05:23,836 --> 02:05:35,742
[SPEAKER_13]: We did change the colors because although yellow is a traditional land use color for residential, when you're talking about different gradations of residential, your eyes tend to start to cross, especially at this scale.

1306
02:05:36,362 --> 02:05:39,704
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm going to zoom into Salem Street here.

1307
02:05:39,764 --> 02:05:41,365
[SPEAKER_13]: This is Salem Street.

1308
02:05:42,505 --> 02:05:46,448
[SPEAKER_13]: And you're going to see two colors right up against that.

1309
02:05:46,488 --> 02:05:53,672
[SPEAKER_13]: So the white area is the area that we've been talking about because now we're talking about the residential only in this map where before

1310
02:05:54,552 --> 02:05:58,516
[SPEAKER_13]: our conversations have been about the mixed use to residential.

1311
02:05:58,576 --> 02:06:06,584
[SPEAKER_13]: So the two colors here, this orange color is neighborhood residential three, and the red color is urban residential one.

1312
02:06:07,144 --> 02:06:17,994
[SPEAKER_13]: And so if I zoom back out, you can see where they are throughout the city, but I want to come over here and sorry, urban residential two is the red color, neighborhood residential three is the orange.

1313
02:06:18,114 --> 02:06:18,295
[SPEAKER_13]: So

1314
02:06:19,055 --> 02:06:42,056
[SPEAKER_13]: We had a couple of options as we were thinking about the MR. Our original proposal was to change the MR to one of the new residential zoning districts, but we can't do that because MR is already in front of you and the neighborhood and urban residential districts haven't yet made it to your way, so we're a little bit caught in the process.

1315
02:06:42,676 --> 02:06:54,745
[SPEAKER_13]: So the idea was to make the dimensions the same and then at the end when we do the full wrap up of looking at the final holistic, where do we need to make tweaks and we could combine them.

1316
02:06:55,245 --> 02:07:02,090
[SPEAKER_13]: We chose the neighborhood residential three which allows single unit dwellings, two unit dwellings, three unit dwellings.

1317
02:07:02,630 --> 02:07:12,516
[SPEAKER_13]: townhouses and historic conversions of 2 to 4 units because so much of the abutting area was residential 3.

1318
02:07:12,556 --> 02:07:21,701
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we could also talk about the UR1 as a possibility if that is of interest to the board and then obviously also of interest to the City Council.

1319
02:07:22,201 --> 02:07:34,357
[SPEAKER_13]: So Urban Residential 1 would allow the 2-unit dwelling, historic conversion of 2-5 units, townhouse 3-unit dwelling, and a multiplex of 4-6 units.

1320
02:07:34,937 --> 02:07:39,423
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that was kind of the transition we originally had with the MR.

1321
02:07:40,304 --> 02:07:47,671
[SPEAKER_13]: then and the proposal that you just saw tonight, the idea was just to let the neighborhood residential come up and sort of attached to where it already exists.

1322
02:07:48,371 --> 02:08:00,663
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think, you know, hearing at least some of the voices on the call and I think Madam Chair mentioned balance earlier, a lot of zoning is that balance of needs and wants and desires.

1323
02:08:01,704 --> 02:08:02,524
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I think that

1324
02:08:03,265 --> 02:08:15,572
[SPEAKER_13]: The urban residential 1 could also be a possibility, but as I said, we chose to go with the neighborhood residential 3 as the new base for the MR, just simply because that that was what was a budding.

1325
02:08:15,692 --> 02:08:22,155
[SPEAKER_13]: So, I wanted to call that out in terms of, you know, I heard the numbers, like, 2 to 4.

1326
02:08:22,775 --> 02:08:26,097
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, that would be that's kind of like outside.

1327
02:08:26,117 --> 02:08:29,059
[SPEAKER_21]: The buckets that we've identified here.

1328
02:08:30,247 --> 02:08:32,309
[SPEAKER_13]: So two to four is the historic conversion.

1329
02:08:32,789 --> 02:08:52,984
[SPEAKER_13]: In the neighborhood residential, we're not for today's conversation on Salem Street, but the future conversation on the residential, we have a historic conversion definition that would allow a historic, because we would like to preserve existing historic homes, they contribute a great deal.

1330
02:08:53,445 --> 02:08:56,207
[SPEAKER_13]: So the idea is to give it a little bit of an incentive.

1331
02:08:56,387 --> 02:08:57,408
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you're,

1332
02:08:58,128 --> 02:09:07,470
[SPEAKER_13]: top number of units per dwelling is three, then you allow the historic conversion for four, so you're giving an incentive to preserve it.

1333
02:09:08,050 --> 02:09:23,294
[SPEAKER_13]: If your top is four units, you're allowing five, so that's why urban residential one allows a historic conversion of two to five units, whereas neighborhood residential three allows a historic conversion of two to four units.

1334
02:09:23,814 --> 02:09:30,340
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's kind of balancing the conversion of the building with the characteristics of the neighborhood.

1335
02:09:32,782 --> 02:09:34,704
[SPEAKER_21]: But new construction could not be four units.

1336
02:09:35,204 --> 02:09:38,367
[SPEAKER_13]: New construction in the neighborhood residential could not be four units.

1337
02:09:38,387 --> 02:09:39,108
[SPEAKER_13]: That is correct.

1338
02:09:39,168 --> 02:09:40,169
[SPEAKER_13]: It's limited to three.

1339
02:09:40,189 --> 02:09:41,530
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1340
02:09:44,762 --> 02:09:50,385
[SPEAKER_13]: But I did want to give the board sort of a peek into the thinking back and forth on that.

1341
02:09:50,425 --> 02:10:05,993
[SPEAKER_13]: We did go back and forth ourselves on Neighborhood Residential 3 versus Urban Residential 1 for those existing residential parcels that butt up against Salem Street itself that were not part of the MX1, that were part of the original MR4.

1342
02:10:06,453 --> 02:10:10,075
[SPEAKER_13]: I do also want to just give a preview again.

1343
02:10:10,415 --> 02:10:10,976
[SPEAKER_13]: We heard some

1344
02:10:11,976 --> 02:10:18,182
[SPEAKER_13]: comments and concerns from people that we weren't overall in the city, we weren't adding enough density.

1345
02:10:18,282 --> 02:10:22,326
[SPEAKER_13]: So I wanted to call out the two squares, Medford Square and West Medford Square.

1346
02:10:22,826 --> 02:10:31,694
[SPEAKER_13]: We have the additional quarters in South Medford, we have the additional quarters on Boston and then looking over at Wellington.

1347
02:10:31,734 --> 02:10:35,177
[SPEAKER_13]: So we haven't touched everywhere in the city yet.

1348
02:10:35,337 --> 02:10:35,798
[SPEAKER_13]: And so

1349
02:10:36,439 --> 02:10:52,460
[SPEAKER_13]: For the people on the call who've been really engaged and thinking about what else could go where I would encourage them to stay part of the process we are having the public meeting on the, you know, all of the planning and permitting meetings, of course, have been public, but we're having a

1350
02:10:52,920 --> 02:11:01,502
[SPEAKER_13]: public listening session in March on the residential and again on the corridors and squares would love to hear from all of the voices that we've heard today on those as well.

1351
02:11:02,042 --> 02:11:08,744
[SPEAKER_13]: So, and then I think the other thing was the idea of additional incentives.

1352
02:11:08,884 --> 02:11:15,206
[SPEAKER_13]: Obviously, we are trying to tailor the incentives neighborhood by neighborhood for what makes sense.

1353
02:11:15,326 --> 02:11:16,846
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are totally open.

1354
02:11:17,426 --> 02:11:31,653
[SPEAKER_13]: Of course, to hearing from from yourselves from the community, if there's a preference that a certain incentive not apply in a particular district, then we'd love to have that as part of the discussion and understand what that is.

1355
02:11:31,713 --> 02:11:35,955
[SPEAKER_13]: And, of course, it's guided by yourselves as to what makes sense where.

1356
02:11:35,975 --> 02:11:44,119
[SPEAKER_21]: How do you feel Ari?

1357
02:11:45,780 --> 02:11:46,080
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

1358
02:11:49,814 --> 02:11:52,596
[SPEAKER_19]: And with that, I think I do have to duck out.

1359
02:11:52,776 --> 02:11:55,098
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you everyone for the great discussion.

1360
02:11:55,779 --> 02:12:01,304
[SPEAKER_19]: And I look forward to seeing how the board votes and I'm sure to the continued discussion over time.

1361
02:12:02,485 --> 02:12:02,765
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1362
02:12:03,706 --> 02:12:03,886
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks.

1363
02:12:03,906 --> 02:12:04,106
[SPEAKER_21]: Sorry.

1364
02:12:04,146 --> 02:12:04,727
[SPEAKER_21]: Have a nice evening.

1365
02:12:05,708 --> 02:12:05,988
[SPEAKER_19]: You too.

1366
02:12:08,470 --> 02:12:08,710
[SPEAKER_21]: All right.

1367
02:12:09,131 --> 02:12:10,392
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter, Annie, Adam.

1368
02:12:12,651 --> 02:12:13,993
[SPEAKER_21]: What's kicking around in your brains?

1369
02:12:15,074 --> 02:12:17,376
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, maybe I'll chime in.

1370
02:12:20,738 --> 02:12:26,701
[SPEAKER_18]: I think what's kicking around in my brain is I feel a little bit conflicted.

1371
02:12:26,721 --> 02:12:34,684
[SPEAKER_18]: And maybe I'll just talk out loud and maybe that resonates with some of the residents and maybe it doesn't.

1372
02:12:36,325 --> 02:12:44,208
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I've had the privilege to live in many different cities across the country.

1373
02:12:45,793 --> 02:12:58,161
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think where I feel conflicted, and I found it quite admirable, I think, the approach that Cambridge ended up taking recently with single-family zoning.

1374
02:12:59,862 --> 02:13:07,626
[SPEAKER_18]: And I find it admirable not in the sense of that Medford should be Cambridge, but in the sense that

1375
02:13:09,827 --> 02:13:32,075
[SPEAKER_18]: I think what I struggle with, I'm a homeowner in Medford, I struggle with just how complicated and intractable these kinds of discussions are and how difficult it is to really understand what exactly is being decided that will then have a long-term repercussion for the fabric of the city.

1376
02:13:33,647 --> 02:14:01,182
[SPEAKER_18]: And so what I found admirable was the clarity of that type of approach to zoning, which was really, I found, in the spirit of true progressivism around kind of looking at the history of zoning and the approaches to zoning and sort of saying, actually, we're kind of going to go back to square one and rethink this approach that we've taken for the last 30, 40, 50 years.

1377
02:14:03,645 --> 02:14:11,768
[SPEAKER_18]: Um and so I also the conflict that I have is I also recognize the jurisdiction of this board or the purview of this board.

1378
02:14:12,208 --> 02:14:31,196
[SPEAKER_18]: I recognize the incredible work that the city has done on the master planning um and so I don't think it's my role as a member of the board to um kind of go against um really the input that has been contributed so much um

1379
02:14:32,261 --> 02:14:45,138
[SPEAKER_18]: to sort of set up this philosophy to zoning and the approach to zoning, and then all the work into what I do think is like a thoughtful consideration to try to meet a lot of the different parties to make this work for the community overall.

1380
02:14:47,161 --> 02:14:52,003
[SPEAKER_18]: And so that's where I feel quite conflicted.

1381
02:14:52,023 --> 02:15:02,187
[SPEAKER_18]: I strongly resonate with the folks talking about just how difficult it is to find affordable places to live in Medford.

1382
02:15:04,768 --> 02:15:23,201
[SPEAKER_18]: And then maybe my other lived experience is that every time that well-intentioned planning has put forward how cities should be designed and looks, 10 or 15 years later, we all look at it and we're like, man, what were we thinking?

1383
02:15:24,042 --> 02:15:27,504
[SPEAKER_18]: Setback laws, the chunking of buildings.

1384
02:15:28,625 --> 02:15:30,626
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I am quite sympathetic that,

1385
02:15:34,251 --> 02:15:48,498
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm trying to try to reconcile that with, is there a way for, as Medford thinks about moving forward, to avoid some of the pitfalls that have happened in the past with zoning?

1386
02:15:49,255 --> 02:15:50,116
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it's kind of like parent.

1387
02:15:50,156 --> 02:15:54,200
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe that's an unsatisfactory answer, but that's what's in my head right now.

1388
02:15:54,500 --> 02:15:55,621
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I hear what you're saying.

1389
02:15:55,641 --> 02:16:06,973
[SPEAKER_21]: And you know, the thing, you know, I feel like the it's with zoning, and then it's also with parenting, like, you know, you always kind of fault your parents for all the mistakes they've made, but we're just going to make new fun and different mistakes.

1390
02:16:07,934 --> 02:16:11,177
[SPEAKER_21]: So with the awareness of, you know, what we've been subject to,

1391
02:16:12,398 --> 02:16:21,027
[SPEAKER_21]: In a zoning context, of course, parenting is a separate meeting, you know, how do we do the best we can given all the facts we know today, and I think.

1392
02:16:21,047 --> 02:16:31,538
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, to your point about our jurisdiction as as a board, the greatest power that we have is these recommendations that we can pass on to the city council.

1393
02:16:32,159 --> 02:16:33,901
[SPEAKER_21]: So, as much as we can.

1394
02:16:36,660 --> 02:16:40,601
[SPEAKER_21]: in recognition of the work that has been done, but also the feedback that we're hearing.

1395
02:16:40,621 --> 02:16:46,963
[SPEAKER_21]: I guess what I'm looking for from the board is, are there specific recommendations?

1396
02:16:47,063 --> 02:16:50,504
[SPEAKER_21]: I have a list in front of me of things that I've been jotting down.

1397
02:16:50,524 --> 02:16:53,945
[SPEAKER_21]: Are there recommendations?

1398
02:16:55,286 --> 02:17:05,309
[SPEAKER_21]: Say we were to move this forward this evening, and I'm not saying we will, but if we were, what recommendations could we provide to the city council to provide

1399
02:17:06,576 --> 02:17:22,614
[SPEAKER_21]: the public, which is so enthusiastically and admirably shown up to these public hearings and participated in meetings and written emails, what recommendations can we include to not make the same mistakes as our parents?

1400
02:17:23,395 --> 02:17:24,476
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, city planners.

1401
02:17:27,066 --> 02:17:36,992
[SPEAKER_21]: Like a couple of ones that I've written down, and I'm curious for Emily, Danielle, Alicia, other members of the board to provide input, even if these could be recommendations.

1402
02:17:38,973 --> 02:17:46,918
[SPEAKER_21]: I think one person made this comment, and I have the name in my notes, but the simple idea of kind of coordinating with Malden for a line zoning across borders.

1403
02:17:47,338 --> 02:17:49,420
[SPEAKER_21]: We obviously can't tell them what to do.

1404
02:17:49,480 --> 02:17:50,520
[SPEAKER_21]: They can't tell us what to do.

1405
02:17:51,281 --> 02:17:54,403
[SPEAKER_21]: The joy of town government in Massachusetts.

1406
02:17:56,499 --> 02:18:03,584
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, I think it would just be helpful to make sure that those communication avenues are established and maintained.

1407
02:18:03,604 --> 02:18:08,087
[SPEAKER_21]: And Alicia and Danielle, this might be something that you already do, but just to really call it out.

1408
02:18:09,725 --> 02:18:21,389
[SPEAKER_21]: I think I recognize the importance of a wide sidewalk in terms of accessibility, usability, but is a 12-foot sidewalk right for Salem Street?

1409
02:18:21,449 --> 02:18:23,490
[SPEAKER_21]: It's already a pretty tight street section.

1410
02:18:23,510 --> 02:18:33,073
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't think we've seen street sections just to help contextualize the sidewalk.

1411
02:18:33,113 --> 02:18:36,514
[SPEAKER_21]: So that may be a helpful study to do, even if it's just the visuals.

1412
02:18:38,872 --> 02:18:51,984
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I would assume, sorry, and correct me if I'm wrong, that part of the whole thing would be these would not be necessarily wide sidewalks extending into the street.

1413
02:18:52,024 --> 02:18:54,166
[SPEAKER_17]: These would be extending in the building direction.

1414
02:18:55,307 --> 02:19:01,033
[SPEAKER_17]: As part of what we've been talking about is that this plan does not have jurisdiction over the street.

1415
02:19:03,307 --> 02:19:09,491
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, but every square foot we take up of building is less buildable area.

1416
02:19:09,511 --> 02:19:10,092
[SPEAKER_17]: Is less building.

1417
02:19:10,192 --> 02:19:10,692
[SPEAKER_17]: That's fair.

1418
02:19:10,852 --> 02:19:11,092
[SPEAKER_21]: Right?

1419
02:19:11,553 --> 02:19:21,219
[SPEAKER_21]: And if we're trying to promote density, housing, diverse uses, that's kind of the balance and trade-off that I was speaking more.

1420
02:19:21,239 --> 02:19:22,300
[SPEAKER_21]: I know we're not going to.

1421
02:19:22,380 --> 02:19:22,760
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, that's fair.

1422
02:19:22,821 --> 02:19:23,561
[SPEAKER_17]: That's nice.

1423
02:19:24,322 --> 02:19:25,582
[SPEAKER_21]: But I appreciate the clarification.

1424
02:19:25,602 --> 02:19:29,865
[SPEAKER_21]: This existing conditions analysis, I think,

1425
02:19:32,892 --> 02:19:37,354
[SPEAKER_21]: I'd be interested in kind of the work involved in that.

1426
02:19:37,474 --> 02:19:41,636
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm not saying that if it's hard work, if it's tough work, we're not going to do it.

1427
02:19:43,297 --> 02:19:45,658
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think there is a lot of validity to that.

1428
02:19:46,059 --> 02:19:50,041
[SPEAKER_21]: You can't have a good idea of where you're going unless you know where you've been.

1429
02:19:50,261 --> 02:19:54,583
[SPEAKER_21]: And I think the existing conditions analysis may be able to capture that.

1430
02:19:56,028 --> 02:20:02,614
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I do think that there needs to be some focus on the incentive zoning menu.

1431
02:20:04,055 --> 02:20:05,716
[SPEAKER_21]: Board member already mentioned affordability.

1432
02:20:05,736 --> 02:20:15,664
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm also going to add climate and low impact living as other focuses that could be revisited as part of that incentive menu.

1433
02:20:16,745 --> 02:20:21,129
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I think a deeper dive into the UR1 versus NR

1434
02:20:24,332 --> 02:20:25,452
[SPEAKER_21]: kind of implications.

1435
02:20:30,113 --> 02:20:33,794
[SPEAKER_21]: I hate that it's like one or the other, and I'm almost wondering, like, does it have to be?

1436
02:20:35,854 --> 02:20:39,195
[SPEAKER_21]: Annie, I see your hand up, so curious to get some other feedback from the board.

1437
02:20:39,215 --> 02:20:50,797
[SPEAKER_14]: I really feel that part of the charm of any city, and I've lived in a lot of places around the world, is

1438
02:20:53,214 --> 02:21:05,379
[SPEAKER_14]: how people gather on a street corner, how they walk down the street, how green space, benches, having a cafe with tables outside.

1439
02:21:06,800 --> 02:21:12,823
[SPEAKER_14]: Boston jokingly, we talk about the cow paths, and that's how Boston was built.

1440
02:21:13,943 --> 02:21:16,324
[SPEAKER_14]: All villages connected by cow paths.

1441
02:21:17,225 --> 02:21:22,067
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think having a 12-foot sidewalk is critical to a charm of a city.

1442
02:21:23,207 --> 02:21:32,152
[SPEAKER_14]: People live in a community to be in that community, not just to be in their home or condo apartment.

1443
02:21:33,012 --> 02:21:36,434
[SPEAKER_14]: They want to be in and out of shops.

1444
02:21:36,554 --> 02:21:39,216
[SPEAKER_14]: They want to be able to stroll down the street.

1445
02:21:39,836 --> 02:21:42,918
[SPEAKER_14]: They want to be able to move a stroller.

1446
02:21:45,259 --> 02:21:46,620
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody who has

1447
02:21:48,159 --> 02:21:51,442
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so I hear that you're in support of the 12-foot sidewalk.

1448
02:21:51,562 --> 02:21:53,503
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the tree thing, too.

1449
02:21:54,124 --> 02:21:55,345
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the tree thing.

1450
02:21:56,065 --> 02:21:59,088
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to have trees.

1451
02:21:59,829 --> 02:22:04,292
[SPEAKER_14]: Human beings need to reflect on trees.

1452
02:22:04,913 --> 02:22:08,255
[SPEAKER_14]: And if you have a skinny sidewalk, the tree dies.

1453
02:22:08,896 --> 02:22:17,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Because what happens is that cars run into it, bicycles jab it, snow plows jab it.

1454
02:22:18,740 --> 02:22:27,222
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have a wide enough sidewalk, it gives a tremendous aura to the community.

1455
02:22:27,762 --> 02:22:28,883
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I hear what you're saying.

1456
02:22:29,783 --> 02:22:40,125
[SPEAKER_21]: So I guess my recommendation was more that maybe we should just look into it, not completely disregard the 12 foot.

1457
02:22:41,446 --> 02:22:46,187
[SPEAKER_21]: But if you're not comfortable looking into it, then maybe that's something we should have.

1458
02:22:49,029 --> 02:23:09,363
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think to the point of having a slightly larger footprint, if the property will allow it, like what we're doing in West Medford Square, and they're putting up quite a few nine apartments in a building.

1459
02:23:11,031 --> 02:23:27,021
[SPEAKER_14]: It fits right in to the look of the street, but it also gives me hope that we will have the train station right there would be better used if we had more density.

1460
02:23:28,462 --> 02:23:36,006
[SPEAKER_21]: So how would you verbalize that into a recommendation around the Salem?

1461
02:23:36,186 --> 02:23:38,528
[SPEAKER_14]: On Salem Street, if

1462
02:23:39,112 --> 02:23:51,878
[SPEAKER_14]: the property would allow, I think having between four and six apartments in a building is not a 15-story building.

1463
02:23:51,938 --> 02:23:58,401
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not becoming something that the community would not appreciate.

1464
02:23:58,461 --> 02:24:02,963
[SPEAKER_14]: But at the same time, a lot of people would like to live in the community.

1465
02:24:03,023 --> 02:24:04,644
[SPEAKER_14]: There's nowhere for them to go.

1466
02:24:06,184 --> 02:24:07,485
[SPEAKER_14]: So I just would like

1467
02:24:08,815 --> 02:24:09,816
[SPEAKER_14]: us to think about it.

1468
02:24:15,258 --> 02:24:22,842
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, and then maybe to sort of maybe continue the thread that Annie was on.

1469
02:24:22,882 --> 02:24:34,908
[SPEAKER_18]: So if the limitation there on the density is really around parking, is there any mechanism

1470
02:24:36,504 --> 02:24:37,765
[SPEAKER_18]: that we can recommend?

1471
02:24:38,205 --> 02:24:40,906
[SPEAKER_18]: Parking lots?

1472
02:24:41,606 --> 02:24:44,707
[SPEAKER_18]: Or that should the parking requirements of the city change?

1473
02:24:46,888 --> 02:24:49,149
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, 100%.

1474
02:24:50,089 --> 02:24:51,590
[SPEAKER_18]: But I don't know how to formulate it.

1475
02:24:51,610 --> 02:24:53,911
[SPEAKER_14]: No, no, I agree with you, Adam.

1476
02:24:54,031 --> 02:25:04,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Part of living in a city is always, when I learned to drive in Manhattan, nobody cared when I took my test if I could drive forward.

1477
02:25:05,379 --> 02:25:12,047
[SPEAKER_14]: on a stopwatch, I had to be able to parallel park, because that was key in Manhattan to be able to park.

1478
02:25:13,008 --> 02:25:21,738
[SPEAKER_14]: The whole idea of big cities, small cities is we can just make recommendations and suggestions.

1479
02:25:22,379 --> 02:25:25,062
[SPEAKER_14]: But if you're in a

1480
02:25:26,419 --> 02:25:40,063
[SPEAKER_14]: a certain size apartment, as a gentleman who had spoke from the community before, if it's a studio apartment or one bedroom, you know, the parking is slightly different.

1481
02:25:40,443 --> 02:25:54,107
[SPEAKER_14]: But if we're going to make a better use of having two different train stations in a small city like Medford, one on each side, we have to consider the concept of parking lots.

1482
02:25:55,708 --> 02:26:10,098
[SPEAKER_21]: Just to refocus us as a board in our discussion, I just want to reiterate that, unfortunately, and I truly agree, unfortunately, we are not discussing parking minimums as part of this Salem Street corridor rezoning.

1483
02:26:11,158 --> 02:26:16,562
[SPEAKER_21]: We did discuss parking minimums as part of the transit-oriented design around Wellington.

1484
02:26:16,582 --> 02:26:17,683
[SPEAKER_21]: We got those down to a point.

1485
02:26:17,703 --> 02:26:20,465
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, the MBTA community zoning, that was part of our discussion.

1486
02:26:20,485 --> 02:26:21,285
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, we got those down to a point.

1487
02:26:23,220 --> 02:26:25,122
[SPEAKER_21]: which was a very fun discussion.

1488
02:26:26,403 --> 02:26:30,906
[SPEAKER_21]: So that is something that may come before us again, but that's not what we're talking about today.

1489
02:26:31,586 --> 02:26:43,875
[SPEAKER_14]: But it reflects on- It is, but I'm just recognizing that- It's about the buildings themselves, and that's what we're talking about, and then we got off on that.

1490
02:26:44,035 --> 02:26:51,600
[SPEAKER_14]: But just simply, we have to consider that maybe in order to make the community

1491
02:26:52,405 --> 02:27:00,307
[SPEAKER_14]: more robust and have more space, maybe we need to consider having more than four in a building.

1492
02:27:02,748 --> 02:27:03,568
[SPEAKER_21]: In terms of units?

1493
02:27:04,668 --> 02:27:04,848
Mm-hmm.

1494
02:27:05,268 --> 02:27:06,088
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, no, I agree.

1495
02:27:06,489 --> 02:27:06,849
[SPEAKER_21]: I agree.

1496
02:27:10,090 --> 02:27:13,350
[SPEAKER_21]: So that can be one of our recommendations, right?

1497
02:27:13,370 --> 02:27:15,551
[SPEAKER_21]: I think that would be right.

1498
02:27:15,671 --> 02:27:15,791
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1499
02:27:16,331 --> 02:27:19,592
[SPEAKER_17]: Would that be under consider upping the

1500
02:27:21,597 --> 02:27:27,381
[SPEAKER_17]: limit the units on the mixed-use one from three to four, if I'm following correctly?

1501
02:27:27,722 --> 02:27:39,350
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it would be aligning the MR more closely with the urban residential one.

1502
02:27:41,572 --> 02:27:42,132
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that what this is?

1503
02:27:42,152 --> 02:27:42,933
[SPEAKER_17]: The other one.

1504
02:27:43,974 --> 02:27:45,015
[SPEAKER_17]: No, correct me if I'm wrong, Emily.

1505
02:27:51,570 --> 02:27:54,891
[SPEAKER_17]: MR on this corridor is currently based on the neighborhood residential three.

1506
02:27:55,711 --> 02:27:59,651
[SPEAKER_17]: And what we were talking about potentially changing it to is the urban residential one.

1507
02:28:00,211 --> 02:28:00,432
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1508
02:28:00,892 --> 02:28:02,412
[SPEAKER_21]: MR equals NR.

1509
02:28:03,272 --> 02:28:03,572
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1510
02:28:03,592 --> 02:28:04,072
[SPEAKER_21]: Right now.

1511
02:28:04,952 --> 02:28:15,634
[SPEAKER_17]: And potentially, one of the recommendations, if we wanted to change it, would be to change it to base more closely on the urban residential one, which was the other option that Emily was presenting earlier.

1512
02:28:16,114 --> 02:28:16,354
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1513
02:28:17,494 --> 02:28:18,975
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the two to six.

1514
02:28:20,495 --> 02:28:20,675
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1515
02:28:22,301 --> 02:28:24,822
[SPEAKER_21]: Which is, I think, what we previously had.

1516
02:28:25,443 --> 02:28:26,563
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, exactly.

1517
02:28:26,583 --> 02:28:27,704
[SPEAKER_17]: Or something closer to it, yeah.

1518
02:28:27,724 --> 02:28:33,187
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it's somewhere between what we had the first time and what we have now, so.

1519
02:28:36,409 --> 02:28:38,750
[SPEAKER_14]: Depending on the property, right?

1520
02:28:39,410 --> 02:28:43,673
[SPEAKER_21]: So makes you sound MR.

1521
02:28:48,580 --> 02:29:06,348
[SPEAKER_21]: So this is where I think an existing conditions analysis would be super dope to have, because the question that I want to ask, and maybe you have the answer to it, is how many single family houses are currently within this MR district?

1522
02:29:08,589 --> 02:29:08,829
[SPEAKER_21]: Emily?

1523
02:29:10,419 --> 02:29:12,840
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, so thank you, Madam Chair.

1524
02:29:12,900 --> 02:29:16,863
[SPEAKER_13]: So just as a reminder, and I actually have the maps up and I can show you.

1525
02:29:16,883 --> 02:29:23,566
[SPEAKER_13]: I think there's two rounds of existing conditions that we did back in July, actually the end of June of last year.

1526
02:29:24,026 --> 02:29:33,331
[SPEAKER_13]: We had a workshop with city council, the public was invited to it and we had, and I'm going to share that very, very quickly.

1527
02:29:34,612 --> 02:29:39,395
[SPEAKER_13]: We had a significant number, you should see a map called recreation up.

1528
02:29:40,135 --> 02:29:44,777
[SPEAKER_13]: So we mapped recreation, we mapped hydrography.

1529
02:29:45,157 --> 02:29:46,737
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is for the whole city?

1530
02:29:46,757 --> 02:29:49,578
[SPEAKER_13]: This is for the whole city, yes.

1531
02:29:49,699 --> 02:29:56,241
[SPEAKER_13]: And just to call it out, we mapped also the surrounding communities.

1532
02:29:57,441 --> 02:30:01,323
[SPEAKER_13]: We got the zoning from the surrounding communities and mapped those as well.

1533
02:30:02,163 --> 02:30:04,006
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm sorry, your audio is really low right now.

1534
02:30:04,286 --> 02:30:04,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I'm sorry.

1535
02:30:05,067 --> 02:30:07,770
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've mapped the surrounding communities.

1536
02:30:07,791 --> 02:30:13,218
[SPEAKER_13]: We actually reached out to the other communities and got their zoning so we could look at it.

1537
02:30:13,278 --> 02:30:15,040
[SPEAKER_13]: This is obviously Medford only.

1538
02:30:15,060 --> 02:30:19,526
[SPEAKER_13]: We mapped demographics, so median income, median age.

1539
02:30:20,026 --> 02:30:23,928
[SPEAKER_13]: It's race, it's the environmental justice populations.

1540
02:30:24,448 --> 02:30:26,509
[SPEAKER_13]: We mapped the residential housing stock.

1541
02:30:26,549 --> 02:30:28,150
[SPEAKER_13]: This is in terms of years.

1542
02:30:28,170 --> 02:30:34,013
[SPEAKER_21]: And this fits the kind of the recommendation of an existing conditions analysis.

1543
02:30:34,293 --> 02:30:36,395
[SPEAKER_13]: This is, yeah, this is everything.

1544
02:30:36,415 --> 02:30:36,795
[SPEAKER_21]: I love this.

1545
02:30:36,955 --> 02:30:37,155
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

1546
02:30:37,255 --> 02:30:40,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Building value, it should all be on the city's website.

1547
02:30:41,277 --> 02:30:52,221
[SPEAKER_13]: We mapped the dimensions, so setbacks, frontage, lot size, building height, building coverage, impervious coverage.

1548
02:30:52,361 --> 02:31:00,184
[SPEAKER_13]: Again, we also, and this is a separate map that we've been working on recently.

1549
02:31:00,244 --> 02:31:02,945
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it answers the question that you just brought up.

1550
02:31:03,605 --> 02:31:09,354
[SPEAKER_13]: Which is this one was done for the residential districts, but we have it for the others.

1551
02:31:09,955 --> 02:31:17,165
[SPEAKER_13]: So the colors on this map are the existing housing types in each of these districts.

1552
02:31:17,185 --> 02:31:18,908
[SPEAKER_13]: So what's on the ground now.

1553
02:31:19,468 --> 02:31:28,760
[SPEAKER_13]: And the borders are our proposed residential district so this map Salem Street we do have another one that shows the whole city.

1554
02:31:29,281 --> 02:31:36,510
[SPEAKER_13]: And so you can start to see by the different colors that the, the variety of housing types that you already have.

1555
02:31:37,130 --> 02:31:44,492
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, in this area, the legend, which isn't on on this version, this is a background map, but the legend tells you which 1 these are.

1556
02:31:44,512 --> 02:31:47,673
[SPEAKER_13]: This map is also available on the city's website.

1557
02:31:47,693 --> 02:31:51,954
[SPEAKER_13]: We just showed it to the planning and permitting council last week while this is up.

1558
02:31:51,974 --> 02:31:54,655
[SPEAKER_21]: Can you clue us in on the legend?

1559
02:31:55,135 --> 02:31:57,496
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, yeah, feel orange purple.

1560
02:31:58,220 --> 02:32:02,702
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, so of course, I grabbed the one that doesn't have the legend.

1561
02:32:03,002 --> 02:32:05,063
[SPEAKER_13]: That always works.

1562
02:32:05,103 --> 02:32:06,583
[SPEAKER_13]: The purple is single family.

1563
02:32:06,603 --> 02:32:09,304
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's easy enough to tell you.

1564
02:32:10,124 --> 02:32:13,706
[SPEAKER_13]: And Paola, if you do have it in front of you, feel free to jump in and correct me.

1565
02:32:13,746 --> 02:32:14,986
[SPEAKER_13]: So purple is single family.

1566
02:32:15,006 --> 02:32:16,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Purple is single family.

1567
02:32:16,727 --> 02:32:17,927
[SPEAKER_13]: The teal is far between.

1568
02:32:17,947 --> 02:32:18,428
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, light purple.

1569
02:32:18,448 --> 02:32:19,888
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, the light purple is single family.

1570
02:32:19,908 --> 02:32:20,668
[SPEAKER_13]: The light purple, OK.

1571
02:32:20,748 --> 02:32:23,209
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, the lavender, maybe.

1572
02:32:23,229 --> 02:32:23,269
[SPEAKER_13]: OK.

1573
02:32:23,610 --> 02:32:25,890
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the other.

1574
02:32:26,070 --> 02:32:27,031
[SPEAKER_25]: Do you want me to?

1575
02:32:27,921 --> 02:32:28,221
[SPEAKER_13]: go.

1576
02:32:29,542 --> 02:32:29,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Go ahead.

1577
02:32:31,322 --> 02:32:33,263
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, so the purple is single family.

1578
02:32:34,043 --> 02:32:36,124
[SPEAKER_25]: The greenish is duplex.

1579
02:32:37,044 --> 02:32:40,825
[SPEAKER_25]: The purple, the dark one is three units.

1580
02:32:41,406 --> 02:32:46,367
[SPEAKER_25]: And then the orange, it was like multi family, I think.

1581
02:32:47,228 --> 02:32:47,268
[SPEAKER_25]: Or

1582
02:32:53,293 --> 02:32:53,814
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it is.

1583
02:32:55,255 --> 02:32:58,959
[SPEAKER_25]: It could be, no, because it's not about the property.

1584
02:33:01,121 --> 02:33:04,244
[SPEAKER_25]: It might be, I don't know if it's some kind of conversion.

1585
02:33:04,264 --> 02:33:05,586
[SPEAKER_25]: I think it's conversion, yes.

1586
02:33:06,547 --> 02:33:08,609
[SPEAKER_25]: It could be kind of conversion actually, yes.

1587
02:33:09,109 --> 02:33:14,875
[SPEAKER_25]: And then the very purple, deeper red that it's almost nowhere there.

1588
02:33:18,367 --> 02:33:20,968
[SPEAKER_21]: What do you mean by multiple family?

1589
02:33:21,209 --> 02:33:23,430
[SPEAKER_21]: Like four to six, six or more?

1590
02:33:24,430 --> 02:33:25,431
[SPEAKER_25]: It doesn't have the cap.

1591
02:33:25,611 --> 02:33:28,212
[SPEAKER_25]: It's three stories or six stories.

1592
02:33:28,313 --> 02:33:32,675
[SPEAKER_25]: It's just more than, let's say, the six units.

1593
02:33:33,716 --> 02:33:40,819
[SPEAKER_25]: There is the blue that is also something between four and six, just to give that idea.

1594
02:33:41,040 --> 02:33:45,802
[SPEAKER_25]: We have it as well that we can see on Salem.

1595
02:33:48,047 --> 02:33:53,588
[SPEAKER_25]: try to look at it and it's not shared yet, but we do have them.

1596
02:33:54,269 --> 02:34:01,710
[SPEAKER_21]: We should have them in the complete- I'm not sure if that was to the existing conditions.

1597
02:34:02,831 --> 02:34:03,371
[SPEAKER_25]: We have it.

1598
02:34:03,831 --> 02:34:06,411
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, in the existing conditions, it should be there as well.

1599
02:34:06,431 --> 02:34:09,592
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1600
02:34:09,652 --> 02:34:11,813
[SPEAKER_24]: Through the chair that doesn't have that.

1601
02:34:13,551 --> 02:34:22,469
[SPEAKER_24]: existing land use map that they are but I don't believe I'm looking to see if I can find it should be in the package from last week's meeting.

1602
02:34:22,489 --> 02:34:22,529
[SPEAKER_13]: So

1603
02:34:24,517 --> 02:34:29,058
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'm just looking to see if we, we have it right where I can get my hands on it.

1604
02:34:29,098 --> 02:34:32,079
[SPEAKER_13]: But I think the point is, we have that analysis.

1605
02:34:32,119 --> 02:34:38,461
[SPEAKER_13]: We are happy to share it directly with the board, but we've been doing a lot of existing conditions analysis.

1606
02:34:38,501 --> 02:34:44,003
[SPEAKER_13]: We go back a lot of our discussion last week for the residential was neighbors coming in and saying,

1607
02:34:44,943 --> 02:34:50,152
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to be able to see what's on the ground, because I think it's this and show them that.

1608
02:34:50,192 --> 02:34:54,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, I didn't realize there were so many two and three in my neighborhoods or.

1609
02:34:54,987 --> 02:34:57,128
[SPEAKER_13]: So that has been part of the discussion.

1610
02:34:57,168 --> 02:35:02,449
[SPEAKER_13]: You may also have noticed under the maps, we actually have a topographical analysis.

1611
02:35:02,489 --> 02:35:20,555
[SPEAKER_13]: We had some comments about sort of the northeastern corner and the smaller lots, but also the steeper hills that make it difficult to add additional housing there because of the actual, the physical access to that.

1612
02:35:20,615 --> 02:35:22,096
[SPEAKER_13]: So we are taking into account

1613
02:35:22,596 --> 02:35:24,718
[SPEAKER_13]: topography, as well as the other conditions.

1614
02:35:24,778 --> 02:35:29,601
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do want to stress that that has been part of this process all the way along.

1615
02:35:29,621 --> 02:35:30,802
[SPEAKER_21]: Awesome.

1616
02:35:31,082 --> 02:35:32,664
[SPEAKER_21]: I really appreciate you sharing that with us.

1617
02:35:33,544 --> 02:35:35,706
[SPEAKER_21]: And it's great to be able to share it in this form as well.

1618
02:35:35,726 --> 02:35:39,469
[SPEAKER_21]: Awesome.

1619
02:35:39,729 --> 02:35:40,029
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1620
02:35:41,590 --> 02:35:47,395
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and I guess the reason why I asked about existing single family is

1621
02:35:49,286 --> 02:35:53,987
[SPEAKER_21]: And I'm in favor of as much housing as possible everywhere.

1622
02:35:54,808 --> 02:36:05,371
[SPEAKER_21]: But I do recognize that my opinion is not fact, which hopefully everybody here can agree that their own opinion is not fact.

1623
02:36:05,991 --> 02:36:11,553
[SPEAKER_21]: But if there is a demand for single family housing within this zone,

1624
02:36:13,735 --> 02:36:24,800
[SPEAKER_21]: Is that something we need to preserve and what I'm seeing based on the existing provision of single family housing is no, there's already so many, and housing is already so rare in Medford.

1625
02:36:25,681 --> 02:36:28,942
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah.

1626
02:36:28,982 --> 02:36:34,905
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry Madam Chair to interrupt, but I did find the map that has Salem Street on it with the residential types, so.

1627
02:36:35,145 --> 02:36:36,506
[SPEAKER_25]: I also had it but you can go.

1628
02:36:37,849 --> 02:36:38,669
[SPEAKER_13]: I got there first.

1629
02:36:39,650 --> 02:36:41,490
[SPEAKER_13]: I added something to the chat, too.

1630
02:36:42,211 --> 02:36:42,511
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

1631
02:36:42,591 --> 02:36:43,071
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1632
02:36:43,731 --> 02:36:46,572
[SPEAKER_13]: We're all searching frantically, the joys of being on the computer.

1633
02:36:46,652 --> 02:36:46,932
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry.

1634
02:36:46,952 --> 02:36:47,652
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me zoom.

1635
02:36:47,672 --> 02:36:51,754
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate the rapid response to questions and comments.

1636
02:36:52,214 --> 02:36:52,754
[SPEAKER_13]: Here you go.

1637
02:36:52,794 --> 02:36:55,075
[SPEAKER_13]: So here's full Salem Street.

1638
02:36:55,115 --> 02:36:56,716
[SPEAKER_13]: So you can see the purple.

1639
02:36:56,796 --> 02:36:59,196
[SPEAKER_13]: And then this one also has a legend.

1640
02:36:59,717 --> 02:37:02,438
[SPEAKER_13]: So you were not far off, Pala, just for memory.

1641
02:37:02,478 --> 02:37:03,178
[SPEAKER_13]: So well done.

1642
02:37:03,798 --> 02:37:08,381
[SPEAKER_13]: So the orange is, in fact, the condo conversion, so it's a two to three family.

1643
02:37:08,761 --> 02:37:10,282
[SPEAKER_13]: The purple is a three family.

1644
02:37:10,662 --> 02:37:12,443
[SPEAKER_13]: The blue is four to eight units.

1645
02:37:13,163 --> 02:37:16,565
[SPEAKER_13]: The really deep purple is the nine plus units.

1646
02:37:17,025 --> 02:37:18,446
[SPEAKER_13]: We have congregate housing.

1647
02:37:18,586 --> 02:37:21,648
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the pink is multiple houses on one parcel.

1648
02:37:22,588 --> 02:37:25,410
[SPEAKER_13]: And I should stress this all came from your assessor's data.

1649
02:37:25,910 --> 02:37:30,313
[SPEAKER_13]: So we're obviously relying on the accuracy of their collection.

1650
02:37:30,373 --> 02:37:33,815
[SPEAKER_13]: But now knowing what those are, let's zoom back into Salem.

1651
02:37:34,415 --> 02:37:40,358
[SPEAKER_13]: And you can still see this is a lower density because it was on a PowerPoint presentation.

1652
02:37:40,719 --> 02:37:43,520
[SPEAKER_13]: But you can see the mix of colors in there.

1653
02:37:43,560 --> 02:37:47,803
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's why we were going back and forth between do we do NR3?

1654
02:37:48,363 --> 02:37:51,986
[SPEAKER_13]: three, or do we do UR1 in this area?

1655
02:37:52,987 --> 02:37:55,149
[SPEAKER_13]: I think you could make a solid case for both.

1656
02:37:55,289 --> 02:38:01,774
[SPEAKER_13]: But UR1, NR3 would be more consistent with what's on the ground now.

1657
02:38:02,475 --> 02:38:10,161
[SPEAKER_13]: UR1 would, I think, be more consistent with the desire to, over time, add additional density.

1658
02:38:10,241 --> 02:38:13,484
[SPEAKER_13]: And you could go either way in that discussion.

1659
02:38:13,504 --> 02:38:14,845
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1660
02:38:16,488 --> 02:38:21,012
[SPEAKER_21]: One of the things I've been struggling with as chair is expressing my own opinion.

1661
02:38:21,032 --> 02:38:27,297
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I recognize that there's people who've lived here longer than me.

1662
02:38:27,337 --> 02:38:29,379
[SPEAKER_21]: There's people who will live here longer than me.

1663
02:38:29,399 --> 02:38:30,540
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm a renter.

1664
02:38:31,861 --> 02:38:38,146
[SPEAKER_21]: The only plots of land I can afford to buy are basically 45 degree angles.

1665
02:38:39,948 --> 02:38:42,049
[SPEAKER_21]: But on this one, you are one.

1666
02:38:43,342 --> 02:38:47,063
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it doesn't make sense to keep things as they are.

1667
02:38:47,363 --> 02:38:48,823
[SPEAKER_21]: As things are, they're unaffordable.

1668
02:38:48,843 --> 02:38:50,424
[SPEAKER_21]: They're inaccessible.

1669
02:38:50,444 --> 02:39:02,046
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I mean, I would definitely support moving the MR in the case of our purview and what we can do.

1670
02:39:02,066 --> 02:39:02,647
[SPEAKER_17]: A recommendation.

1671
02:39:02,687 --> 02:39:09,268
[SPEAKER_17]: Recommending to city council to move the MR back more towards the UR1.

1672
02:39:09,428 --> 02:39:11,029
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I agree.

1673
02:39:11,269 --> 02:39:12,189
[SPEAKER_17]: Aligned towards the UR1.

1674
02:39:13,428 --> 02:39:26,191
[SPEAKER_17]: And I would also, I mean, I also agree with the comments that say things about the streets, but I know that's a separate issue that will be taken up by a different facet of city government at a later time.

1675
02:39:27,431 --> 02:39:27,691
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

1676
02:39:29,371 --> 02:39:32,112
[SPEAKER_17]: And I do think that is a key issue to making this all work.

1677
02:39:32,212 --> 02:39:38,633
[SPEAKER_17]: And I do think that's something, I mean, I have great faith in Todd and Tim and Ellen that they'll

1678
02:39:39,947 --> 02:39:41,449
[SPEAKER_17]: get over in that direction.

1679
02:39:41,469 --> 02:39:43,430
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it's part of the zoning.

1680
02:39:43,450 --> 02:39:49,175
[SPEAKER_17]: The whole process is you have to allow for the city you want to see.

1681
02:39:49,196 --> 02:39:55,581
[SPEAKER_17]: So just doing my requisite writing up of things that I'm hearing.

1682
02:39:57,303 --> 02:40:01,847
[SPEAKER_17]: What I've got so far in terms of recommendations is recommendation to align

1683
02:40:02,664 --> 02:40:09,986
[SPEAKER_17]: the multifamily residential more closely with the urban residential one rather than the neighborhood residential three as is currently present.

1684
02:40:11,147 --> 02:40:27,192
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've got kind of a leftover of Ari's comment but also something I think you brought up, Emily, of to consider giving greater weight in the incentive zoning toward affordability

1685
02:40:28,878 --> 02:40:47,470
[SPEAKER_21]: uh green space green infrastructure and like low impact low environmental impact yeah all right climate resiliency yeah sustainability renewables all that good stuff so we don't crisp up uh

1686
02:40:49,248 --> 02:40:59,817
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't want to disrupt the board's discussion, but I thought if it's helpful, I can put the incentive table up on the so you all can see it.

1687
02:41:01,018 --> 02:41:01,779
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that'd be great.

1688
02:41:01,879 --> 02:41:05,502
[SPEAKER_21]: And Danielle, when we pass or if we pass.

1689
02:41:05,522 --> 02:41:14,089
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm assuming we will at some point in our lives when we pass this on to the city council with our recommendations.

1690
02:41:14,730 --> 02:41:15,751
[SPEAKER_21]: Are they looking for.

1691
02:41:17,968 --> 02:41:26,775
[SPEAKER_21]: like hyper specific tweaks to these incentive bonuses or kind of just these overall like general recommendation or is it both?

1692
02:41:27,655 --> 02:41:35,041
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, Madam Chair, somebody is going to have to translate it into something very specific for them to vote on.

1693
02:41:36,422 --> 02:41:38,844
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're specific, that's great.

1694
02:41:39,484 --> 02:41:41,606
[SPEAKER_22]: One that I was just ruminating on

1695
02:41:42,272 --> 02:41:49,597
[SPEAKER_22]: is that if you all tonight say this is like, we would like it to align with this, or this is how we'd like it to be.

1696
02:41:50,097 --> 02:42:00,883
[SPEAKER_22]: We will then look to Emily and Paula to help us a recommendation that is a net from what the city council originally sent to you to what you're asking for.

1697
02:42:00,903 --> 02:42:03,085
[SPEAKER_22]: Showing like a bridge, yeah, okay.

1698
02:42:03,325 --> 02:42:06,667
[SPEAKER_22]: But that they like change their original document

1699
02:42:07,550 --> 02:42:12,973
[SPEAKER_22]: based on what your recommendations, if they take your recommendations.

1700
02:42:13,174 --> 02:42:15,015
[SPEAKER_22]: But I just always have to caveat that.

1701
02:42:15,355 --> 02:42:17,476
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that's why we're two separate bodies.

1702
02:42:17,977 --> 02:42:24,901
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, they can do changes as well from the floor at that time as well, if that makes sense as well.

1703
02:42:26,062 --> 02:42:34,067
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, so with that, would we have to come back to another meeting to review the content from Emily and Paula?

1704
02:42:36,153 --> 02:42:53,614
[SPEAKER_22]: I think what I'm suggesting is that if you said, we want that area to align with you are three, then Emily will say the table should say that she will take that and translate that into the Community Development Board said they want these numbers in the table.

1705
02:42:54,194 --> 02:42:54,474
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

1706
02:42:54,574 --> 02:43:00,177
[SPEAKER_21]: And would we, is that something we would have to come back as a board and say, yes, we agree with these recommendations.

1707
02:43:00,217 --> 02:43:03,399
[SPEAKER_21]: We're passing them on to like, is that we wait till the 19th for that?

1708
02:43:03,419 --> 02:43:09,103
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't think it's necessary as long as what they're doing is literally exactly what we're saying.

1709
02:43:09,123 --> 02:43:10,643
[SPEAKER_22]: Description and making it.

1710
02:43:10,743 --> 02:43:19,328
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think we're aligned on and Annie or Adam, please speak up if you have input about kind of the.

1711
02:43:22,771 --> 02:43:31,713
[SPEAKER_21]: URI, I'm sorry, UR1, NR, MR. I'm losing letters at this point in the evening.

1712
02:43:33,193 --> 02:43:37,034
[SPEAKER_21]: But I think where we could be more specific is in these incentive bonuses.

1713
02:43:37,054 --> 02:43:44,035
[SPEAKER_21]: Because if we just say, we want you to focus on affordable housing and sustainability, they're going to be like, that's cool, but what does that mean?

1714
02:43:44,656 --> 02:43:50,697
[SPEAKER_21]: So that flips back to us in terms of like, do we want to,

1715
02:43:52,198 --> 02:43:58,225
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're saying right now it's between one and three floors.

1716
02:43:59,006 --> 02:44:04,972
[SPEAKER_14]: And if we want to add two for two additional floors, you add 5%.

1717
02:44:08,898 --> 02:44:10,079
[SPEAKER_21]: Emily, can you walk us through it?

1718
02:44:10,099 --> 02:44:11,280
[SPEAKER_21]: Because I'm going to.

1719
02:44:11,880 --> 02:44:12,861
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, exactly.

1720
02:44:12,881 --> 02:44:16,663
[SPEAKER_13]: So sorry, I was just making sure I was unmuted because I was.

1721
02:44:16,683 --> 02:44:18,785
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll let you know if you aren't.

1722
02:44:19,686 --> 02:44:20,386
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1723
02:44:20,606 --> 02:44:22,608
[SPEAKER_13]: You said your lips are moving, but we can't hear you.

1724
02:44:22,948 --> 02:44:25,189
[SPEAKER_13]: So yes, so exactly.

1725
02:44:25,329 --> 02:44:36,137
[SPEAKER_13]: So if this is the percent of, because this is applying townwide, so we set it up as lots of units and proposed project because it

1726
02:44:36,517 --> 02:44:39,018
[SPEAKER_13]: could potentially be a subdivision.

1727
02:44:40,158 --> 02:44:49,842
[SPEAKER_13]: So for one additional floor based on the number of units or lots, but in this case more likely units, you would have to meet these percentages.

1728
02:44:50,062 --> 02:44:52,503
[SPEAKER_13]: So here is your requirement.

1729
02:44:53,023 --> 02:44:55,184
[SPEAKER_13]: Here is your basic requirement for 80% AMI.

1730
02:44:55,204 --> 02:44:55,364
[SPEAKER_13]: That's

1731
02:44:57,305 --> 02:45:00,067
[SPEAKER_13]: That's part of your affordable housing zoning.

1732
02:45:00,487 --> 02:45:07,751
[SPEAKER_13]: And what we're saying is for deeper affordability, we want affordable units at 65% of AMI.

1733
02:45:08,411 --> 02:45:10,752
[SPEAKER_13]: And so that's your minimum percentage.

1734
02:45:11,012 --> 02:45:12,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Here's your additional at 65%.

1735
02:45:12,553 --> 02:45:15,795
[SPEAKER_13]: So you would have to do 8% for a 10 to 24 unit building, you would have to do 8% at 88 AMI.

1736
02:45:15,855 --> 02:45:17,075
[SPEAKER_13]: We're asking you to do it with

1737
02:45:24,279 --> 02:45:26,800
[SPEAKER_13]: to at 65% AMI.

1738
02:45:26,820 --> 02:45:32,483
[SPEAKER_13]: For two additional floors, you'd have to do five at 80% and five at 65.

1739
02:45:32,583 --> 02:45:38,045
[SPEAKER_13]: In both cases, these add up to the 10%, which is your current affordable requirement.

1740
02:45:38,065 --> 02:45:39,285
[SPEAKER_13]: It's 10% at 80%.

1741
02:45:41,426 --> 02:45:48,849
[SPEAKER_13]: If you were going to do more affordable units as opposed to deeper affordability, this is the percentage of affordable units at 80% AMI

1742
02:45:50,708 --> 02:45:58,554
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is your total percentage of affordable units, additional affordable units to get to that next floor.

1743
02:45:58,614 --> 02:46:00,776
[SPEAKER_13]: So again, we're breaking it up.

1744
02:46:00,836 --> 02:46:05,480
[SPEAKER_13]: We're saying you've got your original 10%, 13% or 15%.

1745
02:46:06,101 --> 02:46:09,764
[SPEAKER_13]: Let's break it up to require that deeper level of affordability.

1746
02:46:11,785 --> 02:46:13,707
[SPEAKER_21]: And thinking specifically around Salem Street.

1747
02:46:13,727 --> 02:46:14,287
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1748
02:46:15,672 --> 02:46:18,733
[SPEAKER_21]: So you said that these incentives are citywide, so.

1749
02:46:19,873 --> 02:46:24,475
[SPEAKER_13]: The intent is that they're supposed to be citywide right now.

1750
02:46:25,235 --> 02:46:30,436
[SPEAKER_13]: They started with the Wellington District with the MBTA Communities Act.

1751
02:46:30,656 --> 02:46:34,077
[SPEAKER_13]: They were morphed a little bit more for MSTIC.

1752
02:46:34,838 --> 02:46:38,699
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we thought a lot once we had done MSTIC about how they should be.

1753
02:46:38,739 --> 02:46:42,520
[SPEAKER_13]: So this is one of those cleanup items I've mentioned from time to time.

1754
02:46:43,060 --> 02:46:57,388
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, as we go through eventually we would like to be have the incentives be as standardized as possible, but with the caveat that there may be if it's something like affordable, you probably want that to be the same city wide.

1755
02:46:57,408 --> 02:46:57,488
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1756
02:46:58,568 --> 02:47:08,115
[SPEAKER_13]: But for some of the others, especially those that have something to do with infrastructure, I think those might might that could be varied by district.

1757
02:47:08,856 --> 02:47:17,362
[SPEAKER_13]: So that would be the community amenities that come through here, I think, for the vibrant neighborhoods and the environmental resilience.

1758
02:47:18,102 --> 02:47:22,505
[SPEAKER_13]: I think for the environmental resilience, that should probably end up being citywide.

1759
02:47:22,585 --> 02:47:26,547
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have the development project meets the ideal green score.

1760
02:47:26,607 --> 02:47:46,940
[SPEAKER_13]: If you remember from a few more than a few weeks back, you have the green score, but then there's that there's a minimum and there's an ideal and if the project meets the ideal, the reason that's in there is that gets them an additional story and by having that greater environmental resilience, if the building certified as net zero emissions,

1761
02:47:47,420 --> 02:47:54,510
[SPEAKER_13]: Or certifiable, certifiable as lead platinum or equivalent standard just because the paperwork is so tough on those.

1762
02:47:54,630 --> 02:47:57,694
[SPEAKER_13]: It's very expensive to get fully certified.

1763
02:47:57,714 --> 02:47:58,515
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1764
02:47:58,575 --> 02:48:03,862
[SPEAKER_21]: And just to confirm, like, you can't stack these to build like a 600 story building.

1765
02:48:04,302 --> 02:48:05,183
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely not.

1766
02:48:05,223 --> 02:48:07,645
[SPEAKER_13]: That's one of the reasons for clarifying the language.

1767
02:48:07,725 --> 02:48:16,453
[SPEAKER_13]: So for Salem Street, where you can only get two additional stories, you're only going to get two of these, right?

1768
02:48:16,533 --> 02:48:21,577
[SPEAKER_13]: So you might get an environmental resilience and an affordability.

1769
02:48:21,677 --> 02:48:28,564
[SPEAKER_13]: You might get two affordabilities, maybe if they've got low income tax credits, and that helps with the financing stack.

1770
02:48:29,404 --> 02:48:35,906
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have the parking concealed below grade or within a building structure that might be more appropriate to MX2.

1771
02:48:35,926 --> 02:48:48,311
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have a provision that would help for smaller or local businesses or non-profits rather for reduced rent.

1772
02:48:48,391 --> 02:48:55,193
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's also in there to contribute to the street and this terminology of vibrant neighborhoods came straight out of the comprehensive plan.

1773
02:48:55,833 --> 02:49:03,181
[SPEAKER_13]: Environmental resilience obviously has been a key of both the comprehensive plan and the climate action adaptation plans.

1774
02:49:03,342 --> 02:49:14,654
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think it's the streetscape improvements through to the community amenities that are probably most likely to vary by neighborhood.

1775
02:49:14,734 --> 02:49:17,357
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think those are also the ones that have had the most

1776
02:49:17,757 --> 02:49:43,058
[SPEAKER_13]: yeah discussion from here is the sort of the how much um this this 300 square feet is a 30 foot frontage by a 10 foot setback that's why it's 300 square feet um pulled out but uh you know those are certainly the ones that have the most conversation around them yeah so if we did want to make recommendations on these there's kind of two directions we can go in one is like de-emphasize

1777
02:49:45,436 --> 02:49:49,438
[SPEAKER_21]: like things that we care less about, like fountain keeps being tossed around.

1778
02:49:49,458 --> 02:49:59,063
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, just as an example, like we could make the fountain water element as like a quarter additional half story, or we can,

1779
02:50:01,682 --> 02:50:05,503
[SPEAKER_21]: overemphasizes things that we do care about, like the affordable housing.

1780
02:50:05,523 --> 02:50:11,685
[SPEAKER_21]: But keeping in mind that there's only so high we can go, specifically within this three-quarter.

1781
02:50:11,785 --> 02:50:12,205
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1782
02:50:12,285 --> 02:50:14,766
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's the thing with the affordability.

1783
02:50:14,786 --> 02:50:23,889
[SPEAKER_17]: There's only so much we can do in this neighborhood if we want to keep things within the dimensional incentives, within the dimensional limits.

1784
02:50:24,389 --> 02:50:30,171
[SPEAKER_21]: So if we pass this, or if we provide a recommendation, let's say this is fine as is.

1785
02:50:33,822 --> 02:50:38,447
[SPEAKER_21]: And it goes to city council and they say, yeah, great, we're going to pass it.

1786
02:50:39,849 --> 02:50:47,197
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there any opportunity to reopen this incentive, these incentive bonuses for future

1787
02:50:48,663 --> 02:50:53,764
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, that's the whole idea is we're looking 30 years in the future, just as an example.

1788
02:50:54,484 --> 02:50:56,445
[SPEAKER_14]: And it might not happen today.

1789
02:50:56,525 --> 02:50:58,605
[SPEAKER_14]: It might not happen 10 years from now.

1790
02:50:59,145 --> 02:51:03,266
[SPEAKER_14]: But if it's zoned appropriately, it could happen down the road.

1791
02:51:04,207 --> 02:51:08,708
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I guess my question is, because in Salem Street, we're talking about a certain scale.

1792
02:51:09,628 --> 02:51:09,868
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

1793
02:51:10,348 --> 02:51:11,008
[SPEAKER_21]: Hold on, Annie.

1794
02:51:15,521 --> 02:51:18,062
[SPEAKER_21]: apply, like, theoretically have standards across the whole city.

1795
02:51:18,862 --> 02:51:29,405
[SPEAKER_21]: And maybe we want to say, like, you know, two additional stories for, you know, 30% AMI, or however we decide to say it.

1796
02:51:31,086 --> 02:51:32,807
[SPEAKER_21]: There will be opportunities down the road.

1797
02:51:32,867 --> 02:51:33,487
[SPEAKER_21]: Hold on, Annie.

1798
02:51:33,767 --> 02:51:34,627
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm asking Emily.

1799
02:51:35,147 --> 02:51:39,849
[SPEAKER_21]: There will be opportunities down the road to say, yes, we can change these things.

1800
02:51:40,229 --> 02:51:40,409
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1801
02:51:41,780 --> 02:51:57,484
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, at the end of this process, when we bring all of the districts back together and we look and see, so let's just say for the sake of the argument, because it's the easiest one, say you said, look, Salem Street doesn't need a fountain or a water element, that doesn't make sense for Salem Street.

1802
02:51:58,004 --> 02:52:01,865
[SPEAKER_13]: So you would modify, you would take it out using this example.

1803
02:52:02,285 --> 02:52:07,987
[SPEAKER_13]: you would recommend to the city council that they take it out, and then that would happen for Salem Street.

1804
02:52:08,087 --> 02:52:16,669
[SPEAKER_13]: And then when we come back, we would say, hey, does a fountain still apply for the other places that have already passed that we put it in?

1805
02:52:16,689 --> 02:52:16,749
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1806
02:52:18,090 --> 02:52:27,653
[SPEAKER_13]: So then you have a new incentive zoning section that says, here are all the incentives, asterisk, the fountain does not apply in Salem Street.

1807
02:52:29,333 --> 02:52:31,674
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to make sure that opportunity to come back.

1808
02:52:31,854 --> 02:52:33,295
[SPEAKER_21]: Because we're talking about Salem Street.

1809
02:52:33,395 --> 02:52:36,857
[SPEAKER_21]: We're hearing from Salem Street neighbors and concerned residents.

1810
02:52:37,317 --> 02:52:42,980
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't want to make decisions on Salem Street based on the whole city.

1811
02:52:43,020 --> 02:52:44,921
[SPEAKER_21]: That scope doesn't feel right.

1812
02:52:45,201 --> 02:52:47,382
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm glad that there's an opportunity to revisit.

1813
02:52:48,223 --> 02:52:51,745
[SPEAKER_21]: Paula, I see your hand and it's been up for a little bit, so I just want to pass it for a second.

1814
02:52:52,785 --> 02:52:53,085
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1815
02:52:53,346 --> 02:52:57,948
[SPEAKER_25]: One thing that we also heard from the neighbors and maybe we can bring that is that

1816
02:52:59,063 --> 02:53:10,981
[SPEAKER_25]: In order to not have every building to have a fountain that we can limit by, so if there is one every half a mile, you cannot have another one.

1817
02:53:11,001 --> 02:53:14,606
[SPEAKER_25]: So you cannot have that incentive if there is already one.

1818
02:53:16,722 --> 02:53:21,827
[SPEAKER_25]: And so we don't have 10 of fountains in the same street.

1819
02:53:22,167 --> 02:53:24,549
[SPEAKER_25]: So that's something that we could add if people are interested.

1820
02:53:24,629 --> 02:53:25,250
[SPEAKER_21]: I like that.

1821
02:53:25,630 --> 02:53:32,457
[SPEAKER_21]: And honestly, I don't think a fountain should give anybody any... You can use the water to water the trees.

1822
02:53:37,950 --> 02:53:42,694
[SPEAKER_25]: So for some senior people, the water is very important when they walk.

1823
02:53:43,294 --> 02:53:46,517
[SPEAKER_25]: So I think that having fountains, it is important.

1824
02:53:47,118 --> 02:53:49,339
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe we can reduce.

1825
02:53:49,620 --> 02:53:51,902
[SPEAKER_25]: Instead of having a half story, they can have less.

1826
02:53:52,762 --> 02:53:56,726
[SPEAKER_25]: But I do recommend to maintain it, especially if you want to have a walkable neighborhood.

1827
02:53:57,286 --> 02:53:57,366
[SPEAKER_25]: OK.

1828
02:53:58,507 --> 02:54:06,614
[SPEAKER_14]: Same as all the other features that you have laid out, Paula, in the drawings.

1829
02:54:07,434 --> 02:54:16,156
[SPEAKER_14]: the plans with having the wide sidewalks and all the other features.

1830
02:54:17,516 --> 02:54:35,100
[SPEAKER_14]: For recommendation, to your point, Emily, that when we look at the housing, is it even on Salem Street, depending on the building, is it possible to add two more apartments?

1831
02:54:37,134 --> 02:54:38,455
[SPEAKER_14]: four to six apartments.

1832
02:54:38,475 --> 02:54:40,917
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I was trying to get at.

1833
02:54:41,638 --> 02:54:53,028
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I think that'll be accomplished by the recommendation of aligning the the multifamily residential zone more closely with the urban residential one.

1834
02:54:53,048 --> 02:54:54,490
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, zoning.

1835
02:54:54,530 --> 02:54:55,250
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's one.

1836
02:54:55,691 --> 02:55:00,855
[SPEAKER_17]: That's one that really works as a recommendation to City Council because both of those are specific things.

1837
02:55:01,816 --> 02:55:02,537
[SPEAKER_17]: So we can say

1838
02:55:03,003 --> 02:55:07,885
[SPEAKER_17]: We want this to go from being modeled on this specific thing to being modeled on this specific thing.

1839
02:55:07,945 --> 02:55:17,750
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's something that I think for Emily and Paula to go back to and edit something for city council, that's going to be, I think, the easiest one.

1840
02:55:19,631 --> 02:55:23,752
[SPEAKER_14]: That makes total sense, since we were heading that way anyway.

1841
02:55:24,433 --> 02:55:27,954
[SPEAKER_21]: So making sure that we're wrapping up this incentive zoning thing.

1842
02:55:30,758 --> 02:55:41,804
[SPEAKER_21]: I agree with the focus on affordability and climate, but within the context of Salem Street, we might not have specific modifications within the menu right now, is what I'm hearing.

1843
02:55:42,104 --> 02:55:45,425
[SPEAKER_21]: Unless it's decreased fountain to a quarter of a story.

1844
02:55:45,905 --> 02:55:48,047
[SPEAKER_21]: That's the one we keep picking on, I feel bad.

1845
02:55:49,927 --> 02:55:55,170
[SPEAKER_21]: But Emily, would you mind throwing up the menu again just so we can give it another look through?

1846
02:55:55,721 --> 02:55:56,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, of course.

1847
02:55:56,642 --> 02:56:00,608
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't want to interfere with the talking as well.

1848
02:56:00,688 --> 02:56:02,731
[SPEAKER_13]: So I appreciate that.

1849
02:56:03,452 --> 02:56:04,253
[SPEAKER_13]: So hang on.

1850
02:56:04,293 --> 02:56:05,435
[SPEAKER_13]: I navigated away from it.

1851
02:56:05,475 --> 02:56:06,957
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me just jump back.

1852
02:56:06,977 --> 02:56:10,001
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a lot of screens open for you right now.

1853
02:56:10,021 --> 02:56:10,401
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1854
02:56:16,865 --> 02:56:17,466
[SPEAKER_13]: There we go.

1855
02:56:17,606 --> 02:56:18,787
[SPEAKER_13]: So let me just start at the top.

1856
02:56:18,847 --> 02:56:28,735
[SPEAKER_13]: I will say that the affordability incentives were very closely tied to other parts of the zoning, which is why I recommend maybe not.

1857
02:56:29,376 --> 02:56:30,737
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not that you can't change them.

1858
02:56:30,817 --> 02:56:35,341
[SPEAKER_13]: I wouldn't necessarily change them without a lot more discussion and work.

1859
02:56:35,501 --> 02:56:38,324
[SPEAKER_13]: But here are the community and amenities.

1860
02:56:40,246 --> 02:56:41,807
[SPEAKER_21]: Indoor pedestrian, outdoor.

1861
02:56:47,688 --> 02:56:51,230
[SPEAKER_21]: Number item one, indoor pedestrian seating or outdoor pedestrian plaza.

1862
02:56:51,590 --> 02:56:56,093
[SPEAKER_21]: That speaks to me of like privately owned public spaces, which never go well.

1863
02:56:56,953 --> 02:56:57,854
[SPEAKER_21]: So maybe that's.

1864
02:56:59,335 --> 02:57:01,716
[SPEAKER_17]: And maybe reduce that.

1865
02:57:02,997 --> 02:57:03,197
[SPEAKER_17]: Well.

1866
02:57:04,278 --> 02:57:05,158
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, yeah.

1867
02:57:05,178 --> 02:57:06,939
[SPEAKER_17]: Reduce that in Fountain to a quarter.

1868
02:57:08,320 --> 02:57:09,641
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's the next step down from.

1869
02:57:09,661 --> 02:57:16,625
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, because I don't equate indoor seating with a pocket park, garden, playground, skate park bank.

1870
02:57:18,985 --> 02:57:24,429
[SPEAKER_21]: Neighborhood open spaces should be more than pedestrian and fountains.

1871
02:57:25,730 --> 02:57:29,933
[SPEAKER_21]: As somebody who works in renewables, love, love, love a good community solar.

1872
02:57:31,798 --> 02:57:34,539
[SPEAKER_21]: But I see those incentives are to be confirmed so I'll accept those.

1873
02:57:35,359 --> 02:57:40,921
[SPEAKER_13]: We're still doing the research on those, sure we get it right so the same thing for the public parking we have to.

1874
02:57:41,221 --> 02:57:44,562
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, part of the parking conversation in the spring, so it's not.

1875
02:57:45,322 --> 02:57:47,743
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't want to do it it's just we haven't gotten to that point.

1876
02:57:48,203 --> 02:57:48,963
[SPEAKER_21]: I appreciate that.

1877
02:57:48,983 --> 02:57:50,863
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay streetscape improvements.

1878
02:57:53,004 --> 02:57:55,387
[SPEAKER_21]: Should we be more specific about streetscape improvements?

1879
02:57:56,187 --> 02:57:57,769
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, is it is it is it?

1880
02:57:57,789 --> 02:57:59,771
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I don't know.

1881
02:58:00,352 --> 02:58:01,673
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt.

1882
02:58:01,713 --> 02:58:09,101
[SPEAKER_13]: We've been having a conversation with director hunt about that because certain things are already required and especially in the special permit process.

1883
02:58:09,701 --> 02:58:15,547
[SPEAKER_13]: So, we do need to confirm that level of detail, but I think that's where it gets into the, the.

1884
02:58:16,468 --> 02:58:21,973
[SPEAKER_13]: the how the street trees are added right there, there are certain levels that you can put them in.

1885
02:58:22,354 --> 02:58:27,899
[SPEAKER_13]: And in terms of using structural soil, how big is the tree pit, etc, etc.

1886
02:58:28,359 --> 02:58:35,666
[SPEAKER_13]: And also whether or not we have those the, you know, request benches along the street for people to rest on or other street furniture.

1887
02:58:35,686 --> 02:58:39,610
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm okay with some ambiguity there.

1888
02:58:43,057 --> 02:58:44,777
[SPEAKER_21]: and then vibrant neighborhoods.

1889
02:58:45,818 --> 02:58:47,378
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me just pull it to the top of the page.

1890
02:58:47,418 --> 02:58:48,538
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that'd be great.

1891
02:58:54,439 --> 02:58:59,020
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the rest of these are fine within the scale of Salem Street.

1892
02:58:59,040 --> 02:59:10,103
[SPEAKER_21]: Now that I think about it, that commercial space all the way to the east,

1893
02:59:14,580 --> 02:59:15,180
[SPEAKER_21]: No, never mind.

1894
02:59:15,821 --> 02:59:16,201
[SPEAKER_21]: Never mind.

1895
02:59:17,461 --> 02:59:17,722
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

1896
02:59:23,384 --> 02:59:29,627
[SPEAKER_21]: Are there any other of these incentive menu items that members of the board want to revisit?

1897
02:59:29,647 --> 02:59:36,790
[SPEAKER_21]: Any that we should jack up or slice down?

1898
02:59:38,611 --> 02:59:43,633
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I'm good with these as they stand for now, I think, in the context of Salem Street.

1899
02:59:44,377 --> 02:59:44,597
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1900
02:59:45,538 --> 02:59:51,142
[SPEAKER_17]: That's given given these recommendations we've just thought through.

1901
02:59:51,683 --> 02:59:59,368
[SPEAKER_17]: And just to confirm with that, we're reducing indoor seating slash outdoor plaza and fountain to a quarter story each from a half.

1902
02:59:59,528 --> 03:00:00,229
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what we're doing?

1903
03:00:00,249 --> 03:00:00,469
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1904
03:00:01,510 --> 03:00:02,110
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, gotcha.

1905
03:00:02,391 --> 03:00:08,695
[SPEAKER_17]: So I've got so far for recommendations to council, I've got that and the multifamily residential adjustment.

1906
03:00:09,396 --> 03:00:09,536
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah.

1907
03:00:13,520 --> 03:00:17,141
[SPEAKER_18]: I know it's late, but I think in the spirit of trying to get it right.

1908
03:00:18,022 --> 03:00:29,727
[SPEAKER_18]: The one on the parking incentive, it's a half story if the building buries the parking or conceals the parking.

1909
03:00:30,847 --> 03:00:32,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Below grade, yes.

1910
03:00:32,168 --> 03:00:33,549
[SPEAKER_13]: Below grade.

1911
03:00:33,609 --> 03:00:37,590
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I might make the recommendation to do a full story.

1912
03:00:37,610 --> 03:00:40,772
[SPEAKER_18]: If the thing that we're trying to encourage is

1913
03:00:41,812 --> 03:00:52,774
[SPEAKER_18]: a vibrant, active street front that, yeah, has density and ground floor, I don't know.

1914
03:00:53,754 --> 03:00:54,594
[SPEAKER_21]: What is it currently?

1915
03:00:54,754 --> 03:00:55,835
[SPEAKER_21]: I thought it was a full story.

1916
03:00:56,395 --> 03:00:57,475
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a half story.

1917
03:00:57,495 --> 03:00:58,375
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a half story?

1918
03:00:58,395 --> 03:00:58,435
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

1919
03:00:59,035 --> 03:01:08,557
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I mean, thinking of the cost of putting parking underground, it's a big cash prize, especially in areas like Medford with

1920
03:01:09,667 --> 03:01:12,508
[SPEAKER_21]: all the exciting stuff we have going on underground already.

1921
03:01:12,528 --> 03:01:15,050
[SPEAKER_21]: I would agree.

1922
03:01:15,070 --> 03:01:16,030
[SPEAKER_21]: I would agree, Adam.

1923
03:01:16,651 --> 03:01:19,232
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter, I know you're a transportation guru.

1924
03:01:20,332 --> 03:01:23,054
[SPEAKER_21]: And Annie, I don't know if you have any other insight here, too.

1925
03:01:23,314 --> 03:01:25,095
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, we were talking about concealing the parking.

1926
03:01:26,275 --> 03:01:26,516
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1927
03:01:26,976 --> 03:01:32,579
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I mean, it just seems to me like a pretty big expense that I don't know if I have story.

1928
03:01:32,599 --> 03:01:34,119
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, no, I agree.

1929
03:01:34,660 --> 03:01:37,661
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I was trying to understand from the discussion.

1930
03:01:37,681 --> 03:01:39,022
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like, it is a big,

1931
03:01:40,086 --> 03:01:42,267
[SPEAKER_17]: parking as it is, is a big expense.

1932
03:01:42,828 --> 03:01:45,429
[SPEAKER_17]: And concealed parking even more so.

1933
03:01:45,870 --> 03:01:55,095
[SPEAKER_17]: But I do think if what we're saying is, this is a big expense, let's reward it appropriately, then I do think I support going after people.

1934
03:01:55,115 --> 03:01:57,757
[SPEAKER_21]: But the expense that would support our goals for.

1935
03:01:57,857 --> 03:01:58,157
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1936
03:01:58,657 --> 03:01:59,258
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, OK.

1937
03:01:59,278 --> 03:02:00,058
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

1938
03:02:00,218 --> 03:02:00,699
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, yeah.

1939
03:02:00,719 --> 03:02:04,261
[SPEAKER_17]: The concealed parking is something that supports our goals for a more vibrant community.

1940
03:02:04,341 --> 03:02:07,163
[SPEAKER_17]: And it is something that if you're doing it, it's expensive to do.

1941
03:02:07,183 --> 03:02:08,984
[SPEAKER_17]: So let's reward that.

1942
03:02:09,785 --> 03:02:11,385
[SPEAKER_17]: it's commensurate with its expense.

1943
03:02:14,306 --> 03:02:14,486
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1944
03:02:15,026 --> 03:02:21,447
[SPEAKER_21]: One of the other things I'm looking through my notes from this evening and previous meetings, there's a lot of discussion around medical office.

1945
03:02:22,867 --> 03:02:28,408
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know if that's something we want to jump into.

1946
03:02:28,428 --> 03:02:37,250
[SPEAKER_21]: I think the provisions that have been made overall support

1947
03:02:38,810 --> 03:02:41,632
[SPEAKER_21]: the preferences of the community while maintaining flexibility.

1948
03:02:42,472 --> 03:02:43,333
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, there is some.

1949
03:02:43,453 --> 03:02:51,937
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, there are still medical uses allowed and some defined cases, clinic is still allowed as defined in state law.

1950
03:02:53,858 --> 03:02:58,641
[SPEAKER_21]: And in some areas per our board's special permit.

1951
03:03:01,062 --> 03:03:01,663
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, neighborhood.

1952
03:03:01,903 --> 03:03:03,244
[SPEAKER_17]: Emily, was I mistaken?

1953
03:03:03,384 --> 03:03:07,266
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought I saw that there's or that's just a definition that was added and it wasn't

1954
03:03:08,169 --> 03:03:11,851
[SPEAKER_13]: It was, sorry, the computer screen was not letting me hit my audio.

1955
03:03:11,951 --> 03:03:21,076
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, the definition was added because it may be appropriate in other parts of the city, but clinic is not allowed.

1956
03:03:21,277 --> 03:03:23,078
[SPEAKER_13]: Medical office is not allowed.

1957
03:03:23,098 --> 03:03:26,440
[SPEAKER_13]: Neighborhood office is- That's what I was thinking.

1958
03:03:26,640 --> 03:03:27,240
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what I was thinking.

1959
03:03:27,340 --> 03:03:29,341
[SPEAKER_17]: The neighborhood medical office, I think that- Yeah.

1960
03:03:29,741 --> 03:03:32,243
[SPEAKER_17]: That's the one that I think was, I think that seems

1961
03:03:33,300 --> 03:03:37,764
[SPEAKER_17]: That seems to make sense, given the neighborhood context, at least at this present time.

1962
03:03:37,824 --> 03:03:43,969
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think I'm fine with that for medical uses for now.

1963
03:03:44,889 --> 03:03:45,170
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1964
03:03:45,310 --> 03:03:45,470
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1965
03:03:45,490 --> 03:03:52,696
[SPEAKER_21]: We had members of the public speak about being able to walk to a dentist or find an accessible provider within the area.

1966
03:03:52,896 --> 03:03:56,899
[SPEAKER_21]: So I think those sort of uses would work.

1967
03:03:57,480 --> 03:03:57,800
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

1968
03:04:01,163 --> 03:04:01,283
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

1969
03:04:03,850 --> 03:04:24,808
[SPEAKER_17]: Just to summarize for the members of the board and staff and city staff, what we have right now is recommendations to city council recommend aligning the multifamily residential zones more closely with the urban residential one rather than the current neighborhood residential three.

1970
03:04:25,689 --> 03:04:30,433
[SPEAKER_17]: We have reduce the zoning incentive,

1971
03:04:31,879 --> 03:04:45,383
[SPEAKER_17]: incentive for indoor seating, outdoor plaza, and fountain to a quarter story from the current half, and increase the incentive for concealed parking up to a full story from a half.

1972
03:04:49,024 --> 03:04:52,885
[SPEAKER_17]: And that is the recommendations as I have them summarized from our discussion.

1973
03:04:52,905 --> 03:04:56,105
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1974
03:04:57,866 --> 03:04:58,126
[SPEAKER_25]: Paula?

1975
03:05:01,830 --> 03:05:09,856
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes, I just wanted to say that in the beginning, there was the conversation about the section and the sidewalks.

1976
03:05:10,237 --> 03:05:11,017
[SPEAKER_25]: Yes.

1977
03:05:11,277 --> 03:05:13,179
[SPEAKER_25]: We did a study in sections.

1978
03:05:14,180 --> 03:05:16,862
[SPEAKER_25]: We did it for Mystic and for Salem.

1979
03:05:18,723 --> 03:05:21,506
[SPEAKER_25]: We used the recommendations from the NACTO.

1980
03:05:21,526 --> 03:05:25,248
[SPEAKER_25]: This is the National Association of City Transportation Officials.

1981
03:05:26,509 --> 03:05:28,231
[SPEAKER_25]: And we tried to really make it

1982
03:05:30,702 --> 03:05:38,866
[SPEAKER_25]: The minimum, because we know that it's very tight, so the minimum to have a walkable street.

1983
03:05:39,426 --> 03:05:46,470
[SPEAKER_25]: And so I'm just going to share, it's going to be a very small image, but just to have a little bit of that idea in section, what does it mean?

1984
03:05:46,490 --> 03:05:47,470
[SPEAKER_25]: That's great.

1985
03:06:06,100 --> 03:06:09,104
[SPEAKER_25]: So do you see my screen?

1986
03:06:09,925 --> 03:06:13,689
[SPEAKER_25]: So these are the different types of sidewalks.

1987
03:06:13,769 --> 03:06:14,911
[SPEAKER_25]: And I know that it's in meters.

1988
03:06:16,453 --> 03:06:17,073
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry for that.

1989
03:06:17,474 --> 03:06:19,857
[SPEAKER_25]: But if you look into the one that says four,

1990
03:06:20,814 --> 03:06:26,298
[SPEAKER_25]: this is more or less what we are planning for Salem Street.

1991
03:06:26,818 --> 03:06:27,959
[SPEAKER_25]: So it's nothing crazy.

1992
03:06:28,019 --> 03:06:41,888
[SPEAKER_25]: We would have some green to really have the buffer to make it more walkable and safe, to be able to plant trees that are decent, and then to be able to walk people side by side, not one after the other.

1993
03:06:43,331 --> 03:06:48,974
[SPEAKER_25]: This will take like three feet in some areas and some other areas in Salem won't take any.

1994
03:06:48,994 --> 03:07:02,703
[SPEAKER_25]: So we just want to make it continue as much as possible and then whenever we don't have green we can have some benches or we can have some furniture like lighting or any other.

1995
03:07:04,324 --> 03:07:15,428
[SPEAKER_25]: So we really think that this is more or less that four, having a minimum of eight for a sidewalk and that is the minimum recommendation from NACTO to have as continuous walking.

1996
03:07:15,989 --> 03:07:17,469
[SPEAKER_21]: This is super helpful.

1997
03:07:18,289 --> 03:07:19,810
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, okay, perfect.

1998
03:07:20,150 --> 03:07:23,832
[SPEAKER_25]: So this is why we really strongly recommend to leave the 12.

1999
03:07:24,832 --> 03:07:32,635
[SPEAKER_25]: It is taking a little bit of the lots, we really understand, but we are making an effort to make this really

2000
03:07:37,031 --> 03:07:41,932
[SPEAKER_25]: and in those conversations, they really agreed that this is what that street needed, just to share that.

2001
03:07:42,492 --> 03:07:44,733
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, these are great street sections.

2002
03:07:45,674 --> 03:07:46,674
[SPEAKER_21]: I love a good diagram.

2003
03:07:47,534 --> 03:07:49,075
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you mind leaving it up for a second?

2004
03:07:49,475 --> 03:07:50,435
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh yeah, sure, sorry.

2005
03:07:51,175 --> 03:07:52,096
[SPEAKER_21]: While we're talking about it.

2006
03:07:53,636 --> 03:07:54,456
[SPEAKER_21]: Cool, thank you.

2007
03:07:55,637 --> 03:08:01,179
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and one of the concerns that we heard again and again from members of the public is around safety.

2008
03:08:02,979 --> 03:08:04,860
[SPEAKER_21]: And if Salem Street,

2009
03:08:06,702 --> 03:08:19,630
[SPEAKER_21]: as it is now continues to be a highly trafficked road, we wanna make sure that the pedestrians and residents and users have enough space to occupy the sidewalk and not have to be pushed out into the road.

2010
03:08:19,650 --> 03:08:31,678
[SPEAKER_21]: So yeah, seeing this like this, I like the 12 feet and hearing that in some areas it would take three feet of space

2011
03:08:33,678 --> 03:08:37,279
[SPEAKER_21]: but most of the time it'd be fine, brings me more comfort with it.

2012
03:08:37,479 --> 03:08:38,219
[SPEAKER_21]: So thank you.

2013
03:08:39,479 --> 03:08:45,961
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, just the clarification that in most areas, but in some will be fine and some they have to give that more or less repeat.

2014
03:08:46,201 --> 03:08:46,441
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

2015
03:08:46,701 --> 03:08:46,881
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2016
03:08:48,261 --> 03:08:48,681
[SPEAKER_21]: Understood.

2017
03:08:50,802 --> 03:08:50,882
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay.

2018
03:08:50,922 --> 03:08:56,603
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, board.

2019
03:08:58,483 --> 03:08:59,183
[SPEAKER_21]: What are we thinking?

2020
03:09:00,303 --> 03:09:02,524
[SPEAKER_21]: Are there more recommendations we want to

2021
03:09:05,589 --> 03:09:09,151
[SPEAKER_21]: put down, is there more thinking we need to do?

2022
03:09:09,171 --> 03:09:10,651
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there more we need to hear?

2023
03:09:10,672 --> 03:09:29,341
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, I kind of like the direction of the discussions we have and I personally would be good going forward with our recommendations and passing it down the line to city council for their further thoughts.

2024
03:09:32,522 --> 03:09:33,883
[SPEAKER_21]: When we pass it to city council,

2025
03:09:36,288 --> 03:09:37,529
[SPEAKER_21]: they can make changes on the floor.

2026
03:09:37,989 --> 03:09:38,669
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, yes.

2027
03:09:39,349 --> 03:09:52,775
[SPEAKER_21]: So I would encourage members of the public to continue to advocate for the topics that they're passionate about, whether it's more housing or safety or uses.

2028
03:09:56,016 --> 03:10:03,199
[SPEAKER_21]: I feel confident that the board with the support of the city and its associates has done our due diligence

2029
03:10:07,405 --> 03:10:10,707
[SPEAKER_21]: around public comments around our scope of the board.

2030
03:10:10,747 --> 03:10:15,210
[SPEAKER_21]: So yeah, I'd also be comfortable passing a recommendation.

2031
03:10:16,531 --> 03:10:20,634
[SPEAKER_21]: Annie, Adam, how are you all feeling?

2032
03:10:22,495 --> 03:10:23,576
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry, Adam, I didn't catch that.

2033
03:10:24,577 --> 03:10:25,417
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd be comfortable too.

2034
03:10:26,138 --> 03:10:26,478
[SPEAKER_21]: OK.

2035
03:10:28,299 --> 03:10:29,160
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, me too.

2036
03:10:30,140 --> 03:10:30,480
[SPEAKER_14]: OK.

2037
03:10:31,081 --> 03:10:33,342
[SPEAKER_17]: OK, so with that, I'm going to move to

2038
03:10:38,722 --> 03:10:42,063
[SPEAKER_17]: What's the formal term to what we're doing?

2039
03:10:42,103 --> 03:10:43,964
[SPEAKER_17]: Are we approving with recommendations?

2040
03:10:45,505 --> 03:10:56,469
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm looking for a motion to recommend approval of the draft zoning as revised with recommendations from the Community Development Board.

2041
03:10:56,529 --> 03:11:00,911
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, so moved.

2042
03:11:00,931 --> 03:11:03,452
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm looking for a second.

2043
03:11:04,820 --> 03:11:06,101
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll second that motion.

2044
03:11:06,121 --> 03:11:08,042
[SPEAKER_21]: You can't second yourself, Peter.

2045
03:11:08,062 --> 03:11:09,463
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't.

2046
03:11:09,603 --> 03:11:11,124
[SPEAKER_17]: That was Adam.

2047
03:11:12,645 --> 03:11:13,605
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you for the clarification.

2048
03:11:14,146 --> 03:11:16,227
[SPEAKER_21]: Adam, feel free to second anybody.

2049
03:11:17,228 --> 03:11:19,889
[SPEAKER_21]: So with that, we're going to do a roll call vote.

2050
03:11:22,431 --> 03:11:23,071
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter Calves?

2051
03:11:24,372 --> 03:11:24,492
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

2052
03:11:25,873 --> 03:11:26,453
[SPEAKER_21]: Annie Strang?

2053
03:11:27,214 --> 03:11:27,354
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

2054
03:11:28,294 --> 03:11:28,955
[SPEAKER_21]: Adam Behrens?

2055
03:11:29,915 --> 03:11:30,016
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

2056
03:11:31,216 --> 03:11:33,778
[SPEAKER_21]: And I, Emily Hedeman, am also an aye.

2057
03:11:35,175 --> 03:11:43,657
[SPEAKER_21]: So with that, we recommend approval of the draft zoning as revised for the recommendations from the Community Development Board.

2058
03:11:43,677 --> 03:11:49,959
[SPEAKER_21]: Again, I encourage members of the public to continue dialogue around this, reach out to your city councilors.

2059
03:11:53,340 --> 03:12:01,142
[SPEAKER_21]: And yeah, thank you all so much for your just commitment to making Medford just such a great place to live.

2060
03:12:04,734 --> 03:12:06,736
[SPEAKER_21]: really appreciate everybody's time this evening.

2061
03:12:06,756 --> 03:12:15,063
[SPEAKER_21]: Alicia or Danielle, is there anything else we need to do around this to make sure we're kind of putting a bow on it?

2062
03:12:16,718 --> 03:12:19,999
[SPEAKER_22]: messaged Emily to make sure that she felt confident.

2063
03:12:20,099 --> 03:12:25,501
[SPEAKER_22]: We may need to review the video to capture all of the recommendations and write it all up.

2064
03:12:26,401 --> 03:12:40,245
[SPEAKER_22]: I expect, I think this is usually Danielle's process, but we're gonna ask Emily's team to package it all up so that what we're sending are the changes from the original that was referred out by the city council.

2065
03:12:41,784 --> 03:12:46,485
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I think that we usually run all the, like a decision by you.

2066
03:12:46,985 --> 03:12:59,148
[SPEAKER_22]: We will definitely send you the document so that you can read through it and make sure that you, we heard you like, cause we're going to take the words said verbally and put them on paper.

2067
03:12:59,168 --> 03:13:01,869
[SPEAKER_21]: And it sounds like Peter also took some notes.

2068
03:13:01,969 --> 03:13:05,010
[SPEAKER_21]: So Peter, if you can share those with Alicia and Danielle.

2069
03:13:05,765 --> 03:13:06,186
[SPEAKER_21]: That would be cool.

2070
03:13:06,206 --> 03:13:06,507
[SPEAKER_17]: Sure, yeah.

2071
03:13:06,628 --> 03:13:11,905
[SPEAKER_17]: I took my regular, well, for what a lot of developments would be, my condition notes.

2072
03:13:13,158 --> 03:13:13,518
[SPEAKER_22]: Awesome.

2073
03:13:13,778 --> 03:13:17,460
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you only tough thing is it just so you're aware we are trying to move it.

2074
03:13:18,081 --> 03:13:24,144
[SPEAKER_22]: We're only trying to move it quickly because the city council continued till next Tuesday, which is the 11th.

2075
03:13:24,724 --> 03:13:30,787
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, if we don't get it to them for their ability to vote next Tuesday, it goes out another two weeks.

2076
03:13:31,407 --> 03:13:34,249
[SPEAKER_22]: And they, you know, we just don't want to drag it out forever.

2077
03:13:34,269 --> 03:13:35,249
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2078
03:13:36,150 --> 03:13:36,310
[SPEAKER_22]: But

2079
03:13:38,238 --> 03:13:38,498
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

2080
03:13:39,599 --> 03:13:45,885
[SPEAKER_21]: And I also want to extend a thank you to Emily and Pella for your very thorough process.

2081
03:13:46,786 --> 03:13:48,207
[SPEAKER_21]: I think you've made this much stronger.

2082
03:13:48,227 --> 03:13:55,034
[SPEAKER_21]: Appreciate your responsiveness to the board, to the city, to the public.

2083
03:13:56,495 --> 03:14:00,318
[SPEAKER_21]: I look forward to seeing how this all works out.

2084
03:14:01,399 --> 03:14:02,521
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

2085
03:14:02,641 --> 03:14:03,982
[SPEAKER_13]: And we appreciate your time.

2086
03:14:04,623 --> 03:14:07,366
[SPEAKER_13]: effort and energy and also the people who spoke today.

2087
03:14:07,386 --> 03:14:10,610
[SPEAKER_13]: I think all the voices are making it a much stronger process.

2088
03:14:10,690 --> 03:14:21,061
[SPEAKER_13]: So we appreciate people taking time out to to share their thoughts, their concerns and you know where they think we've gone right and where they think you know the zoning needs more work.

2089
03:14:21,181 --> 03:14:22,563
[SPEAKER_13]: So really appreciate them.

2090
03:14:23,224 --> 03:14:33,089
[SPEAKER_21]: And the last thing I'll say to members of the public is that a couple of us on the board have our terms coming to an end or expiring the middle of this summer.

2091
03:14:33,650 --> 03:14:43,155
[SPEAKER_21]: So I'd encourage anybody that's super passionate about this work, super passionate about Medford to apply for community development board positions.

2092
03:14:44,676 --> 03:14:47,237
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been doing it, I think for three, four years.

2093
03:14:47,257 --> 03:14:49,398
[SPEAKER_21]: It's super rewarding.

2094
03:14:49,418 --> 03:14:51,920
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I don't know if Peter can speak to it too.

2095
03:14:52,320 --> 03:14:54,140
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we're coming up on two years.

2096
03:14:54,160 --> 03:14:56,681
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm one of the people whose terms are up in June.

2097
03:14:57,341 --> 03:14:58,461
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2098
03:14:58,822 --> 03:14:59,502
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

2099
03:14:59,562 --> 03:15:02,642
[SPEAKER_21]: You're not going to make your money back.

2100
03:15:03,403 --> 03:15:07,844
[SPEAKER_21]: But we all owe the city of Medford a great debt for being a great place to live.

2101
03:15:07,924 --> 03:15:11,785
[SPEAKER_21]: And hopefully, we can all do what we can do to make it better.

2102
03:15:11,845 --> 03:15:13,945
[SPEAKER_21]: So fill out those applications.

2103
03:15:15,865 --> 03:15:18,006
[SPEAKER_21]: We'd love to have some of you on the board.

2104
03:15:20,045 --> 03:15:23,226
[SPEAKER_21]: Cool, all right, so our next agenda item is minutes.

2105
03:15:26,226 --> 03:15:28,767
[SPEAKER_21]: We have minutes from the 15th and the 5th.

2106
03:15:30,688 --> 03:15:40,070
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm gonna look for, well, first of all, are there any comments from members of the board on those meeting minutes?

2107
03:15:42,790 --> 03:15:43,611
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have any.

2108
03:15:43,891 --> 03:15:44,031
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

2109
03:15:44,831 --> 03:15:45,471
[SPEAKER_14]: They look great.

2110
03:15:48,917 --> 03:15:50,618
[SPEAKER_21]: City staff has been doing a great job with those.

2111
03:15:51,958 --> 03:15:52,619
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you so much.

2112
03:15:54,099 --> 03:16:02,182
[SPEAKER_21]: So what I'm going to look for is a motion to accept and approve the two sets of meeting minutes for January 15th and February 5th.

2113
03:16:05,583 --> 03:16:13,966
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll make a motion to approve both sets of meeting minutes for the 15th and February 5th.

2114
03:16:14,806 --> 03:16:15,447
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Annie.

2115
03:16:15,567 --> 03:16:16,327
[SPEAKER_21]: Looking for a second.

2116
03:16:18,301 --> 03:16:19,062
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll second that.

2117
03:16:19,763 --> 03:16:20,444
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you, Adam.

2118
03:16:20,945 --> 03:16:21,586
[SPEAKER_21]: I recognize it.

2119
03:16:21,646 --> 03:16:24,750
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, so we're gonna do a roll call vote.

2120
03:16:25,551 --> 03:16:26,192
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter Calves.

2121
03:16:27,574 --> 03:16:27,674
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

2122
03:16:28,615 --> 03:16:29,256
[SPEAKER_21]: Annie Strang.

2123
03:16:30,197 --> 03:16:30,257
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

2124
03:16:31,239 --> 03:16:31,880
[SPEAKER_21]: Adam Behrens.

2125
03:16:32,941 --> 03:16:33,061
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

2126
03:16:33,882 --> 03:16:35,104
[SPEAKER_21]: Myself, Emily Hedeman, aye.

2127
03:16:39,427 --> 03:16:43,628
[SPEAKER_21]: So the next agenda item we have is zoning updates.

2128
03:16:44,509 --> 03:16:51,070
[SPEAKER_21]: Seeing as we're rapidly approaching 11 o'clock, I'm just going to ask city staff if they have any quick high-level updates.

2129
03:16:54,711 --> 03:17:01,993
[SPEAKER_24]: Madam Chair, the residential zoning was voted out of committee last week.

2130
03:17:02,233 --> 03:17:02,913
[SPEAKER_24]: Was that right, Alicia?

2131
03:17:06,307 --> 03:17:09,128
[SPEAKER_24]: And so we'll be going to city council to be referred.

2132
03:17:09,709 --> 03:17:13,771
[SPEAKER_24]: So that will be the next coming before you.

2133
03:17:15,672 --> 03:17:17,533
[SPEAKER_22]: You got a little bit of a taste tonight.

2134
03:17:18,255 --> 03:17:21,357
[SPEAKER_22]: That and the change in the MBTA zoning.

2135
03:17:21,637 --> 03:17:21,937
[SPEAKER_22]: Right.

2136
03:17:22,518 --> 03:17:23,058
[SPEAKER_22]: That's next.

2137
03:17:23,158 --> 03:17:24,559
[SPEAKER_24]: That's next meeting, actually.

2138
03:17:24,579 --> 03:17:25,379
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay.

2139
03:17:25,859 --> 03:17:27,340
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, well, we have public comments.

2140
03:17:27,941 --> 03:17:36,826
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a very, it's a very minor change to the MBTA zoning that is being proposed by one of the property owners and we are in supportive of it.

2141
03:17:37,686 --> 03:17:37,906
[SPEAKER_21]: Great.

2142
03:17:38,867 --> 03:17:39,107
[SPEAKER_21]: Awesome.

2143
03:17:43,633 --> 03:17:47,655
[SPEAKER_21]: So with that, I am looking for a motion to adjourn.

2144
03:17:47,975 --> 03:17:49,336
[SPEAKER_21]: Unless, is there any other business?

2145
03:17:50,916 --> 03:17:51,637
[SPEAKER_21]: No, seeing none.

2146
03:17:51,937 --> 03:17:52,237
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

2147
03:17:52,637 --> 03:17:54,058
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm looking for a motion to adjourn.

2148
03:17:54,078 --> 03:17:59,841
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll move to adjourn.

2149
03:18:00,961 --> 03:18:01,882
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm looking for a second.

2150
03:18:02,762 --> 03:18:04,363
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll second that motion.

2151
03:18:05,003 --> 03:18:05,443
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2152
03:18:05,463 --> 03:18:06,804
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll do a roll call vote.

2153
03:18:07,384 --> 03:18:08,004
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter Kalbst.

2154
03:18:09,185 --> 03:18:09,305
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

2155
03:18:10,366 --> 03:18:10,926
[SPEAKER_21]: Annie Strang.

2156
03:18:11,666 --> 03:18:11,806
[SPEAKER_21]: Aye.

2157
03:18:12,667 --> 03:18:13,267
[SPEAKER_21]: Adam Behrens.

2158
03:18:14,183 --> 03:18:14,303
[SPEAKER_18]: Aye.

2159
03:18:15,284 --> 03:18:19,125
[SPEAKER_21]: And I, Emily Henneman, am also an aye for the adjournment.

2160
03:18:20,406 --> 03:18:28,109
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you to city staff for your tireless effort and support in these issues.

2161
03:18:28,189 --> 03:18:29,330
[SPEAKER_21]: We could not do this without you.

2162
03:18:31,111 --> 03:18:33,011
[SPEAKER_21]: And thank you to members of the public for coming out.

2163
03:18:36,313 --> 03:18:37,633
[SPEAKER_21]: Peter, anything else?

2164
03:18:37,693 --> 03:18:38,614
[SPEAKER_21]: No, no.

2165
03:18:39,214 --> 03:18:39,994
[SPEAKER_21]: No, drop the mic.

2166
03:18:41,570 --> 03:18:42,772
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, have a nice evening, everyone.

2167
03:18:43,253 --> 03:18:44,154
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you.

2168
03:18:44,675 --> 03:18:45,457
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a good week.

2169
03:18:45,657 --> 03:18:46,038
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.
