1
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:10,528
Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:11,409
And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,149 --> 00:00:14,792
Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,092 --> 00:00:17,834
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,475 --> 00:00:20,176
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,457 --> 00:00:28,363
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,203 --> 00:00:32,246
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:34,728
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:42,067 --> 00:00:43,648
Yep.

10
00:00:44,609 --> 00:00:45,590
Alright, thanks for joining me.

11
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:49,934
If you could just introduce yourself with your name, pronouns and a bit about who you are.

12
00:00:50,794 --> 00:00:51,115
Sure.

13
00:00:51,275 --> 00:00:52,076
Thanks for having me.

14
00:00:52,176 --> 00:00:54,337
Brianna Lungo Kern, Mayor of Medford.

15
00:00:55,078 --> 00:00:56,659
And my pronouns are she her.

16
00:00:58,301 --> 00:01:01,183
And if I know you've been on a few times, maybe this has changed.

17
00:01:01,263 --> 00:01:05,927
But I'll ask you the same question we ask everybody, which is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what you like to eat there.

18
00:01:06,988 --> 00:01:08,910
Gosh, I love

19
00:01:09,518 --> 00:01:12,361
a number of spots, the Ford, the vault.

20
00:01:13,903 --> 00:01:20,832
The last place I ate probably a few weeks ago was Fiore Italy, and I got this seafood risotto.

21
00:01:21,192 --> 00:01:22,193
It was to die for.

22
00:01:22,213 --> 00:01:26,418
And it was just great atmosphere, a little restaurant right on Salem Street.

23
00:01:26,458 --> 00:01:29,422
So that's probably the most recent, so I'll go with that.

24
00:01:29,863 --> 00:01:31,364
Yeah, we love that place too.

25
00:01:31,464 --> 00:01:31,864
It's great.

26
00:01:32,704 --> 00:01:32,944
Awesome.

27
00:01:32,964 --> 00:01:38,247
So I just want to acknowledge that this is, I think this is like your fourth time coming on the show.

28
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:40,528
And I think you were one of our first guests in the beginning.

29
00:01:40,548 --> 00:01:46,471
We started the podcast during the last municipal election or leading up to the last municipal election two years ago.

30
00:01:47,431 --> 00:01:50,553
And at that point I was recording out of my shed.

31
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:54,274
So thanks for being brave enough to come to my backyard to record that.

32
00:01:55,855 --> 00:02:00,477
And, you know, you're pretty deep in coven two years ago and you're running for your second term.

33
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:13,003
And so now you're running for your third term as mayor of Medford, and hopefully the big crisis of coven is mostly behind us so I kind of wonder how.

34
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:27,853
Like, you know, how you kind of figure that into your third term and maybe like how it's kind of impacted your the four years that you've been our mayor and kind of how you see kind of the retreat of COVID impacting your goals for the third term.

35
00:02:28,794 --> 00:02:29,094
Sure.

36
00:02:29,134 --> 00:02:29,354
Yep.

37
00:02:29,514 --> 00:02:33,635
COVID lasted a good two, three years and

38
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:56,877
I think it's only made me a stronger leader, just having to deal with emergency after crisis, after emergency, after, you know, working with our Board of Health Director and making sure everybody stayed healthy and safe, while at the same time trying to create a culture change in the city and make sure that we have the best people

39
00:02:57,795 --> 00:02:58,576
for each job.

40
00:02:58,836 --> 00:03:04,422
So although we were dealing with COVID, I was still working to build a team in City Hall.

41
00:03:04,502 --> 00:03:06,123
That's obviously my main role.

42
00:03:07,084 --> 00:03:08,305
And we were able to do that.

43
00:03:08,365 --> 00:03:19,997
And because we have such a strong team, I feel like even throughout COVID, we were still working every day on issues, on projects, on anything and everything that

44
00:03:20,577 --> 00:03:21,798
you know, affects our residents.

45
00:03:22,038 --> 00:03:42,346
So as you see now, it's, I mean, you're three and a half and you look out driving around Medford, you see patchwork being done on our streets, you see tree stumps being removed, you see multiple parks getting rehabbed or completely redone like Car Park, Morrison, Hickey Park, the list goes on.

46
00:03:42,846 --> 00:03:44,407
You see our fire stations getting

47
00:03:45,848 --> 00:03:54,031
new windows, new flooring, new roofs, because of all the hard work that the team that I put in place has done.

48
00:03:54,151 --> 00:03:57,292
So I didn't never take credit for any of the work myself.

49
00:03:57,832 --> 00:03:59,992
Every part of this is a team effort.

50
00:04:00,092 --> 00:04:10,215
And it's exciting to know that even though we went through COVID, we were still in the office working for the best interests of our community.

51
00:04:10,776 --> 00:04:11,856
So I think

52
00:04:12,642 --> 00:04:16,703
Even though COVID's over, we still are seeing the effects of COVID.

53
00:04:17,044 --> 00:04:23,646
And with that, we are moving into year, almost into year, end of year four.

54
00:04:25,006 --> 00:04:28,187
And we were able to get an MVP grant.

55
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:33,769
So now we have nine people on staff that speak another language.

56
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:40,111
We've been able to try to reach out to all of our communities, Brazilian, Haitian population.

57
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:41,612
We're trying to build trust.

58
00:04:42,152 --> 00:04:52,555
trying to make sure that every person in Medford is involved in what goes on from the charter survey to the trash pickup survey and so forth.

59
00:04:53,076 --> 00:05:04,499
So we're still trying to work through the effects of COVID, not only by marginalized communities, but also what's going on in our schools and the mental health crisis that's out there.

60
00:05:04,519 --> 00:05:06,040
You know, we still have, you know,

61
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:10,112
a lot of issues, but we're working through it.

62
00:05:10,172 --> 00:05:25,559
And that's kind of where I see the future, continuing to build on what we've done, continuing to build a strong team, hold people accountable so that, you know, our residents know who they employ is out there doing the tough, the hard work.

63
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:26,719
And that's all I ask.

64
00:05:26,739 --> 00:05:31,301
Honest days pay for just do your work.

65
00:05:31,401 --> 00:05:34,863
So you'll see sometimes that I have opposition, but

66
00:05:35,417 --> 00:05:45,509
that's the hard work of trying to get the best people in these roles and make sure people are held accountable so we can get the best results for our city.

67
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:46,930
Thank you.

68
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:51,652
You said something earlier about a culture change that you're hoping for.

69
00:05:52,013 --> 00:06:03,698
It sounds like any new mayor coming in maybe wants to create an identity with the city or have a lasting impact on the city and the culture of the city.

70
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:07,060
What do you mean when you say a culture change for Medford?

71
00:06:08,721 --> 00:06:11,422
Well, part of it's what I spoke about, about holding people accountable.

72
00:06:12,088 --> 00:06:15,311
Before I came into office, there was no human resources.

73
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:18,033
So it's almost as if nobody did anything wrong.

74
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:20,695
And I come in, I create the office.

75
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:30,783
We now have a new HR director, Lisa Crowley, who came from Methuen, fixed what went on over in Methuen, especially within the police department.

76
00:06:31,084 --> 00:06:33,325
And she's amazing.

77
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:37,169
So the culture change is happening.

78
00:06:40,021 --> 00:06:45,048
grief from it, from people that are just used to doing things the way they used to do them, but now...

79
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:50,376
And that's a small percentage, but still, that's part of my day.

80
00:06:50,396 --> 00:07:04,805
I drive home from work, and I make myself think about all the amazing people we have working hard, getting projects done, and busting their butts every day, sometimes every night, for the best interest of the community.

81
00:07:05,326 --> 00:07:08,928
But I, during the day, have to focus on, OK, who did what?

82
00:07:09,088 --> 00:07:10,809
What are we going to do about it?

83
00:07:10,949 --> 00:07:13,271
And how are we going to just shift this culture

84
00:07:15,517 --> 00:07:18,218
so people understand you have to do the right thing.

85
00:07:18,278 --> 00:07:19,919
You have to be qualified for a job.

86
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,280
I'm not gonna just hire friends.

87
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,640
That's not how it should be.

88
00:07:23,841 --> 00:07:27,302
And sometimes I'm like, should I be in government?

89
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:30,883
Because it is politics, and there's an election every two years.

90
00:07:31,724 --> 00:07:33,365
But I don't really think of it that way.

91
00:07:33,945 --> 00:07:39,967
Maybe I should be in the private sector, because I am tough, but I'm doing it for the right reasons.

92
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:43,689
And I feel the shift, and we're gonna just keep moving in that direction.

93
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:50,580
Yeah, I think anytime you try to change a culture that people are comfortable with, it's hard.

94
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:58,045
And we made a point earlier about the way that different communities in Medford have maybe not historically had great access to City Hall.

95
00:07:58,105 --> 00:08:04,490
And I think COVID crisis really highlighted that when people learned that we sort of do rely on our city government for a lot.

96
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:09,373
And so it sounds like that's a big piece of what you've been working on as well.

97
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:13,391
Yeah, the diversity is a huge piece of the culture change too.

98
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:18,413
We worked hard over the first few years to diversify our police department.

99
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:27,176
I got a lot of pushback on that when we tried to move people that spoke a second language up underneath the veterans.

100
00:08:27,977 --> 00:08:36,560
And now you'll see last week or the week before pushing out the fact that the fire exam's coming up on the 29th and we put it out in multiple different languages because

101
00:08:37,253 --> 00:08:46,701
I've been able to work with City Hall and a number of different departments, and I just wanna keep moving the needle because diversity is, we want representation.

102
00:08:47,282 --> 00:08:58,572
The representation, the people that live in our community should represent every department, every facet of our city, including our schools and our police, fire, Department of Public Works, City Hall.

103
00:08:58,752 --> 00:09:02,996
And you are seeing the change there too, which I'm very proud of.

104
00:09:04,081 --> 00:09:22,042
Yeah, seems it's like also during COVID people sounded like they got a little bit more engaged with city politics and, and like, I noticed that diversity like of all kinds right is it's changing the city if you look at like, I mean just going like listening to are going to some of the city events where I think it was your

105
00:09:24,698 --> 00:09:29,841
Was it your inauguration or something where every person who spoke was a woman except for Terry Carter?

106
00:09:30,641 --> 00:09:34,984
Just highlighting the increase in women that are part of city government.

107
00:09:35,845 --> 00:09:38,907
It sounds like that's a change since you started on city council.

108
00:09:39,227 --> 00:09:39,847
How long ago?

109
00:09:40,728 --> 00:09:43,270
Yeah, that's the reason why I ran for city council.

110
00:09:43,290 --> 00:09:48,913
At the crazy age of 20, I say my brain wasn't fully developed now that I think back, I'm like, why did I do this?

111
00:09:48,993 --> 00:09:50,534
But at 20, there was

112
00:09:51,692 --> 00:09:54,893
I believe one woman, and they were all older men.

113
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:55,993
And I'm like, why?

114
00:09:56,113 --> 00:09:58,234
We need more young representation.

115
00:09:58,294 --> 00:10:00,194
We need more diverse representation.

116
00:10:00,254 --> 00:10:01,415
And that's why I ran.

117
00:10:01,495 --> 00:10:04,956
And I'm still in it trying to, like I said, move the needle.

118
00:10:04,996 --> 00:10:06,496
And we're making a lot of progress.

119
00:10:06,536 --> 00:10:07,096
I'm proud of it.

120
00:10:07,777 --> 00:10:11,878
There's great men that work for the city, and there's great women that work for the city.

121
00:10:11,918 --> 00:10:19,760
And that's all I want to do is just put the best team in place and make sure we give everybody an opportunity for every single job.

122
00:10:21,297 --> 00:10:33,240
Yeah, so I think when I know hopefully I'll also talk to the other to other candidate for mayor, but I feel like one thing that that come that will probably come up comes up a lot is like the the budget.

123
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:40,261
And I know we've talked before about sort of your hope for new revenue streams from new businesses coming into Medford.

124
00:10:40,282 --> 00:10:44,863
So I wonder if you could like kind of update us on your hopes for the next couple years.

125
00:10:45,623 --> 00:10:49,384
Sure, you'll see this year and next year, you're going to see a lot of shovels in the ground.

126
00:10:49,784 --> 00:10:50,684
We have the rise

127
00:10:51,591 --> 00:10:55,254
building that will be put up right above Bertucci's.

128
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:56,955
That's going to be eight stories.

129
00:10:57,016 --> 00:10:58,216
That's fully ready to go.

130
00:10:58,256 --> 00:11:00,078
There was a lawsuit holding it up.

131
00:11:00,138 --> 00:11:00,999
That's ready to go.

132
00:11:01,079 --> 00:11:05,903
We just negotiated with 40B Development right behind Wegmans.

133
00:11:05,943 --> 00:11:11,267
That's going to be, I believe, close to 350 units.

134
00:11:11,287 --> 00:11:13,268
25% will be affordable.

135
00:11:13,288 --> 00:11:17,131
100% of those will count towards our affordable housing stock.

136
00:11:19,522 --> 00:11:21,762
Mystic Ave, Combined Properties.

137
00:11:22,563 --> 00:11:30,184
After I won the second election, they really started to turn their idea around, and it's going to be a billion-dollar life science project, fingers crossed.

138
00:11:30,904 --> 00:11:34,385
We have a number of other small places.

139
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:39,405
We have Theory that's almost ready to open, which is our first cannabis retail shop.

140
00:11:39,485 --> 00:11:41,986
We have three of those that we're working through.

141
00:11:42,026 --> 00:11:45,927
We have two delivery companies with diverse owners.

142
00:11:46,527 --> 00:11:48,487
And then we have one potential

143
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,831
Cultivation Center on Mystic Ave.

144
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,112
Then we have the Great American Beer Hall.

145
00:11:53,132 --> 00:11:59,314
We'll be kind of cutting a ribbon for the groundbreaking next week for that.

146
00:11:59,374 --> 00:12:02,055
That's going to be a great spot to, you know, hang out.

147
00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:05,097
We're trying to bring in new business everywhere we can.

148
00:12:05,237 --> 00:12:07,538
So that's just a little bit.

149
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,018
We're getting ready for Square.

150
00:12:09,038 --> 00:12:10,539
We're working on an RFP4.

151
00:12:10,579 --> 00:12:14,140
We're hoping MAPC will continue that work with us.

152
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,201
We're trying to develop the waterfront.

153
00:12:18,723 --> 00:12:26,407
We do an RFP for consultant to help us draft the full RFP for the air rights above Wellington Circle.

154
00:12:26,487 --> 00:12:31,909
And that is going to be a huge, huge development that we hope to move forward.

155
00:12:32,009 --> 00:12:39,933
That's going to take obviously several years, but we're working hard and we have been able to double our staff in the planning department.

156
00:12:39,993 --> 00:12:43,215
So we now have a housing planner, we have

157
00:12:44,795 --> 00:12:50,240
We have people on staff that are really interested in all types of development in Medford.

158
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:57,466
And we're trying to bring the community, we get the community involved by asking each developer to have a community meeting.

159
00:12:57,506 --> 00:12:58,807
We wanna know people's concerns.

160
00:12:59,148 --> 00:13:04,072
We wanna make sure what we're doing is the right place, the right fit for each neighborhood.

161
00:13:04,152 --> 00:13:10,878
So not only we're trying to move a number of development pieces, but then also making sure the community is involved.

162
00:13:10,938 --> 00:13:12,279
And I think that's the most important part.

163
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,420
Because we do.

164
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:31,546
We need new growth to be able to afford not only new ideas, but we have several positions and several things that we're using one-time funding for, which is the ARPA funding, that is only going to last for another 18 months.

165
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:35,547
So when you talk budget, my mind's always, you know,

166
00:13:36,217 --> 00:13:38,158
going through, okay, how much money do we have left?

167
00:13:38,178 --> 00:13:39,719
Where are we gonna spend it?

168
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:51,627
Let's be thoughtful and let's make sure that the people we have in certain positions, we're able to do all we can to keep them, like our social worker and like our community connectors that are out in our community.

169
00:13:52,187 --> 00:13:56,430
We have an economic development planner that's on opera.

170
00:13:56,510 --> 00:14:02,134
So we're always looking for ways to boost new growth in the right way.

171
00:14:03,295 --> 00:14:04,315
Yeah, that's exciting stuff.

172
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:05,795
I hadn't heard about the beer hall.

173
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:06,516
That's exciting.

174
00:14:08,156 --> 00:14:09,736
All that stuff sounds great.

175
00:14:10,096 --> 00:14:14,817
I think they posted a picture on social media recently, but I'll highlight it next week.

176
00:14:14,837 --> 00:14:17,637
We're just going to do a quick groundbreaking.

177
00:14:18,218 --> 00:14:20,398
They want to do a groundbreaking event.

178
00:14:20,478 --> 00:14:24,859
So that hopefully will take about a year.

179
00:14:26,419 --> 00:14:26,619
Great.

180
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:27,519
Thank you.

181
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:31,900
Is there anything else that you're excited to promote or that you want people to hear about?

182
00:14:34,902 --> 00:14:54,716
Gosh, just that the work needs to, you know, that I work hard every day with our team and we have so many projects that we're working on, so many that I've mentioned today, so many more like, you know, our climate goals and, you know, furthering arts and culture.

183
00:14:55,157 --> 00:14:59,220
So there's just so much more to do and that's why, you know, I'm running again to

184
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:06,869
to continue the hard work that I do every day and because I do it for the right reasons.

185
00:15:07,069 --> 00:15:19,114
I sleep decent at night because I'm always, I may not be perfect, I may make mistakes, but I always try to do what's in the best interest of the community and listen to everybody.

186
00:15:19,194 --> 00:15:23,456
I'm not gonna just listen to one side.

187
00:15:23,516 --> 00:15:26,698
I really try to do what's best for the entire community.

188
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:30,611
We have a lot more work to do, and we're plugging away.

189
00:15:30,771 --> 00:15:33,751
It's been great, as you see when you drive around the city.

190
00:15:34,152 --> 00:15:34,812
A lot going on.

191
00:15:36,232 --> 00:15:40,593
And I see that you've had some office hours at different local businesses.

192
00:15:40,893 --> 00:15:47,215
What's the best way for people to get in touch with you or share their thoughts with you if they want to?

193
00:15:48,993 --> 00:15:52,357
I have five email addresses, I check them all myself.

194
00:15:52,657 --> 00:16:02,428
So the mayor, email mayor at medford-ma.gov is the best way to get me because I'm on that 6am, 9pm, weekends.

195
00:16:02,975 --> 00:16:06,777
So I really try to check that on myself so that I know what the concerns are.

196
00:16:06,797 --> 00:16:08,458
I know what issues are out there.

197
00:16:08,478 --> 00:16:11,580
I am able to read it and grasp it myself.

198
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:15,923
So I try to block out at least two plus hours a day just on email.

199
00:16:16,023 --> 00:16:17,484
And that's seven days a week.

200
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:19,145
Then we have office hours.

201
00:16:19,205 --> 00:16:22,487
I'm going to be doing another one at CB Scoops in September.

202
00:16:22,547 --> 00:16:25,949
I'm going to try to do one through the campaign on a Saturday.

203
00:16:25,969 --> 00:16:28,531
So I'm trying to do different times, different locations.

204
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:35,772
Administrative assistant's always there to help with anybody that wants to call.

205
00:16:35,832 --> 00:16:39,634
She gets compliments on how nice she is to residents all the time.

206
00:16:39,734 --> 00:16:50,677
We can't necessarily fix every single issue, but I always say, even if it's bad news, at least I'm getting back to people and communicating and getting them the answers that they deserve.

207
00:16:50,757 --> 00:16:55,979
So I'm pretty accessible, especially by email and through my office staff.

208
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:59,440
I'm always at as many events as I can be.

209
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,901
know all the different functions that are happening around the city.

210
00:17:06,061 --> 00:17:14,386
So I feel like I say this every time we talk but it's like sometimes I it feels like you're in multiple places at once when you see all the events that you're going to.

211
00:17:14,406 --> 00:17:14,546
So

212
00:17:16,004 --> 00:17:28,169
It's hard because I'm sick of the pictures, but then if I go to four things on a Saturday and I don't post one, then it's like, why didn't you post our event?

213
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:31,090
People can say too many pictures, but I'm like, you don't understand.

214
00:17:32,971 --> 00:17:35,572
Why didn't she go to that event when she went to this?

215
00:17:36,192 --> 00:17:44,295
So I just like to highlight all the organizations that are putting on some great events and the nonprofits that are working so hard for our community.

216
00:17:45,052 --> 00:17:47,632
It's important to highlight new businesses that open.

217
00:17:47,672 --> 00:17:54,514
You know, we had a grand opening yesterday for dentists, Smile Forever, that's right on High Street.

218
00:17:54,614 --> 00:17:55,934
So it's important.

219
00:17:56,374 --> 00:17:57,074
It's important work.

220
00:17:58,434 --> 00:18:00,135
And if it's not on social media, it didn't happen.

221
00:18:00,855 --> 00:18:02,095
Didn't happen.

222
00:18:02,835 --> 00:18:02,975
Right.

223
00:18:02,995 --> 00:18:03,395
Well, thank you.

224
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:07,736
I have one final question, which this episode will come out after we already know the answer.

225
00:18:07,776 --> 00:18:11,197
But right now, do you have a prediction for who will win the Women's World Cup?

226
00:18:12,377 --> 00:18:13,397
I think it's going to be Columbia.

227
00:18:14,077 --> 00:18:16,638
Ooh, that would be interesting.

228
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:23,859
My top predictions are Japan and England, but it would be great to see somebody over there.

229
00:18:23,899 --> 00:18:26,860
It will be on in my house, because my husband's a huge soccer fan.

230
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:31,341
So he was up at 5 AM, I think it was Saturday morning, watching.

231
00:18:31,441 --> 00:18:35,221
And I'm like, you're crazy, because you had family over the night before.

232
00:18:35,321 --> 00:18:38,042
So he was right there with you, watching.

233
00:18:38,202 --> 00:18:40,182
I wish all the team the best of luck.

234
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:42,783
It's great for our female athletes

235
00:18:43,473 --> 00:18:45,215
just see role models.

236
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:49,398
My one soccer player is my daughter, my middle child.

237
00:18:49,478 --> 00:18:52,861
And yeah, it's great to have those role models for them.

238
00:18:53,281 --> 00:18:53,662
For sure.

239
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:54,743
All right.

240
00:18:54,763 --> 00:18:57,825
Well, thank you and good luck with the rest of the campaign.

241
00:18:58,346 --> 00:18:58,646
Thank you.

242
00:18:58,706 --> 00:18:59,347
Thanks for having me.

243
00:18:59,627 --> 00:18:59,807
All right.

244
00:19:08,853 --> 00:19:10,794
