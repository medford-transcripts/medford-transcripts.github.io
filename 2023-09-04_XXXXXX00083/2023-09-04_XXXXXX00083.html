    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=9.147">Hey</a>  listeners, this is Danielle. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=10.888">And</a>  Shelley. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=12.149">Shelley</a>  is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.</p>

    <p>[Chelli Keshavan]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=15.092">And</a>  Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=18.475">And</a>  this is the Medford Bites podcast. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=21.457">Every</a>  two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=29.203">Join</a>  us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=32.666">And</a>  as always, tell us where you like to eat.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=42.067">Yep.</a> </p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=44.609">Alright,</a>  thanks for joining me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=45.89">If</a>  you could just introduce yourself with your name, pronouns and a bit about who you are.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=50.794">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=51.275">Thanks</a>  for having me. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=52.176">Breanna</a>  Lungo-Koehn, Mayor of Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=55.078">And</a>  my pronouns are she her.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=58.301">And</a>  if I know you've been on a few times, maybe this has changed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=61.263">But</a>  I'll ask you the same question we ask everybody, which is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what you like to eat there.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=66.988">Gosh,</a>  I love <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=69.518">a</a>  number of spots, the Ford, the vault. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=73.903">The</a>  last place I ate probably a few weeks ago was Fiore Italy, and I got this seafood risotto. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=81.192">It</a>  was to die for. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=82.213">And</a>  it was just great atmosphere, a little restaurant right on Salem Street. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=86.458">So</a>  that's probably the most recent, so I'll go with that.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=89.863">Yeah,</a>  we love that place too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=91.464">It's</a>  great. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=92.704">Awesome.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=92.964">So</a>  I just want to acknowledge that this is, I think this is like your fourth time coming on the show. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=98.307">And</a>  I think you were one of our first guests in the beginning. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=100.548">We</a>  started the podcast during the last municipal election or leading up to the last municipal election two years ago. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=107.431">And</a>  at that point I was recording out of my shed. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=110.633">So</a>  thanks for being brave enough to come to my backyard to record that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=115.855">And,</a>  you know, you're pretty deep in coven two years ago and you're running for your second term. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=121.077">And</a>  so now you're running for your third term as mayor of Medford, and hopefully the big crisis of coven is mostly behind us so I kind of wonder how. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=134.43">Like,</a>  you know, how you kind of figure that into your third term and maybe like how it's kind of impacted your the four years that you've been our mayor and kind of how you see kind of the retreat of COVID impacting your goals for the third term.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=148.794">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=149.134">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=149.514">COVID</a>  lasted a good two, three years and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=154.737">I</a>  think it's only made me a stronger leader, just having to deal with emergency after crisis, after emergency, after, you know, working with our Board of Health Director and making sure everybody stayed healthy and safe, while at the same time trying to create a culture change in the city and make sure that we have the best people <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=177.795">for</a>  each job. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=178.836">So</a>  although we were dealing with COVID, I was still working to build a team in City Hall. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=184.502">That's</a>  obviously my main role. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=187.084">And</a>  we were able to do that. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=188.365">And</a>  because we have such a strong team, I feel like even throughout COVID, we were still working every day on issues, on projects, on anything and everything that <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=200.577">you</a>  know, affects our residents. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=202.038">So</a>  as you see now, it's, I mean, you're three and a half and you look out driving around Medford, you see patchwork being done on our streets, you see tree stumps being removed, you see multiple parks getting rehabbed or completely redone like Carr Park, Morrison, Hickey Park, the list goes on. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=222.846">You</a>  see our fire stations getting <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=225.848">new</a>  windows, new flooring, new roofs, because of all the hard work that the team that I put in place has done. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=234.151">So</a>  I didn't never take credit for any of the work myself. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=237.832">Every</a>  part of this is a team effort. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=240.092">And</a>  it's exciting to know that even though we went through COVID, we were still in the office working for the best interests of our community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=250.776">So</a>  I think <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=252.642">Even</a>  though COVID's over, we still are seeing the effects of COVID. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=257.044">And</a>  with that, we are moving into year, almost into year, end of year four. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=265.006">And</a>  we were able to get an MVP grant. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=268.287">So</a>  now we have nine people on staff that speak another language. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=274.169">We've</a>  been able to try to reach out to all of our communities, Brazilian, Haitian population. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=280.451">We're</a>  trying to build trust. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=282.152">trying</a>  to make sure that every person in Medford is involved in what goes on from the charter survey to the trash pickup survey and so forth. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=293.076">So</a>  we're still trying to work through the effects of COVID, not only by marginalized communities, but also what's going on in our schools and the mental health crisis that's out there. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=304.519">You</a>  know, we still have, you know, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=306.831">a</a>  lot of issues, but we're working through it. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=310.172">And</a>  that's kind of where I see the future, continuing to build on what we've done, continuing to build a strong team, hold people accountable so that, you know, our residents know who they employ is out there doing the tough, the hard work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=325.859">And</a>  that's all I ask. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=326.739">Honest</a>  days pay for just do your work. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=331.401">So</a>  you'll see sometimes that I have opposition, but <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=335.417">that's</a>  the hard work of trying to get the best people in these roles and make sure people are held accountable so we can get the best results for our city.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=346.61">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=346.95">You</a>  said something earlier about a culture change that you're hoping for. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=352.013">It</a>  sounds like any new mayor coming in maybe wants to create an identity with the city or have a lasting impact on the city and the culture of the city. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=363.798">What</a>  do you mean when you say a culture change for Medford?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=368.721">Well,</a>  part of it's what I spoke about, about holding people accountable. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=372.088">Before</a>  I came into office, there was no human resources. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=375.411">So</a>  it's almost as if nobody did anything wrong. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=378.133">And</a>  I come in, I create the office. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=380.755">We</a>  now have a new HR director, Lisa Crowley, who came from Methuen, fixed what went on over in Methuen, especially within the police department. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=391.084">And</a>  she's amazing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=393.425">So</a>  the culture change is happening. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=400.021">grief</a>  from it, from people that are just used to doing things the way they used to do them, but now... <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=406.373">And</a>  that's a small percentage, but still, that's part of my day. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=410.396">I</a>  drive home from work, and I make myself think about all the amazing people we have working hard, getting projects done, and busting their butts every day, sometimes every night, for the best interest of the community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=425.326">But</a>  I, during the day, have to focus on, OK, who did what? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=429.088">What</a>  are we going to do about it? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=430.949">And</a>  how are we going to just shift this culture <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=435.517">so</a>  people understand you have to do the right thing. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=438.278">You</a>  have to be qualified for a job. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=439.939">I'm</a>  not gonna just hire friends. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=442.3">That's</a>  not how it should be. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=443.841">And</a>  sometimes I'm like, should I be in government? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=447.322">Because</a>  it is politics, and there's an election every two years. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=451.724">But</a>  I don't really think of it that way. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=453.945">Maybe</a>  I should be in the private sector, because I am tough, but I'm doing it for the right reasons. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=460.087">And</a>  I feel the shift, and we're gonna just keep moving in that direction.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=464.876">Yeah,</a>  I think anytime you try to change a culture that people are comfortable with, it's hard. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=470.6">And</a>  we made a point earlier about the way that different communities in Medford have maybe not historically had great access to City Hall. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=478.105">And</a>  I think COVID crisis really highlighted that when people learned that we sort of do rely on our city government for a lot. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=485.01">And</a>  so it sounds like that's a big piece of what you've been working on as well.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=489.77">Yeah,</a>  the diversity is a huge piece of the culture change too. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=493.731">We</a>  worked hard over the first few years to diversify our police department. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=498.433">I</a>  got a lot of pushback on that when we tried to move people that spoke a second language up underneath the veterans. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=507.977">And</a>  now you'll see last week or the week before pushing out the fact that the fire exam's coming up on the 29th and we put it out in multiple different languages because <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=517.253">I've</a>  been able to work with City Hall and a number of different departments, and I just wanna keep moving the needle because diversity is, we want representation. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=527.282">The</a>  representation, the people that live in our community should represent every department, every facet of our city, including our schools and our police, fire, Department of Public Works, City Hall. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=538.752">And</a>  you are seeing the change there too, which I'm very proud of.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=544.081">Yeah,</a>  seems it's like also during COVID people sounded like they got a little bit more engaged with city politics and, and like, I noticed that diversity like of all kinds right is it's changing the city if you look at like, I mean just going like listening to are going to some of the city events where I think it was your <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=564.698">Was</a>  it your inauguration or something where every person who spoke was a woman except for Terry Carter? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=570.641">Just</a>  highlighting the increase in women that are part of city government. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=575.845">It</a>  sounds like that's a change since you started on city council. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=579.227">How</a>  long ago?</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=621.297">Yeah,</a>  so I think when I know hopefully I'll also talk to the other to other candidate for mayor, but I feel like one thing that that come that will probably come up comes up a lot is like the the budget. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=633.82">And</a>  I know we've talked before about sort of your hope for new revenue streams from new businesses coming into Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=640.282">So</a>  I wonder if you could like kind of update us on your hopes for the next couple years.</p>

getting ready for Square. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=729.038">We're</a>  working on an RFP4. <a

do an RFP for consultant to help us draft the full RFP for the air rights above Wellington Circle. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=746.487">And</a>  that is going to be a huge, huge development that we hope to move forward. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=752.009">That's</a>  going to take obviously several years, but we're working hard and we have been able to double our staff in the planning department. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=759.993">So</a>  we now have a housing planner, we have <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=764.795">We</a>  have people on staff that are really interested in all types of development in Medford. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=770.26">And</a>  we're trying to bring the community, we get the community involved by asking each developer to have a community meeting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=777.506">We</a>  wanna know people's concerns. <a

able to afford not only new ideas, but we have several positions and several things that we're using one-time funding for, which is the ARPA funding, that is only going to last for another 18 months. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=811.766">So</a>  when you talk budget, my mind's always, you know, <a

thoughtful and let's make sure that the people we have in certain positions, we're able to do all we can to keep them, like our social worker and like our community connectors that are out in our community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=832.187">We</a>  have an economic development planner that's on opera. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=836.51">So</a>  we're always looking for ways to boost new growth in the right way.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1036.004">It's</a>  hard because I'm sick of the pictures, but then if I go to four things on a Saturday and I don't post one, then it's like, why didn't you post our event? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1048.189">People</a>  can say too many pictures, but I'm like, you don't understand. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1052.971">Why</a>  didn't she go to that event when she went to this? <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1056.192">So</a>  I just like to highlight all the organizations that are putting on some great events and the nonprofits that are working so hard for our community. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1065.052">It's</a>  important to highlight new businesses that open. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1067.672">You</a>  know, we had a grand opening yesterday for dentists, Smile Forever, that's right on High Street. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1074.614">So</a>  it's important. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1076.374">It's</a>  important work.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1078.434">And</a>  if it's not on social media, it didn't happen.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1080.855">Didn't</a>  happen.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1082.835">Right.</a>  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1082.995">Well,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1083.415">I</a>  have one final question, which this episode will come out after we already know the answer. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1087.776">But</a>  right now, do you have a prediction for who will win the Women's World Cup?</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1092.377">I</a>  think it's going to be Columbia.</p>

    <p>[Danielle Balocca]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1094.077">Ooh,</a>  that would be interesting. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1097.138">My</a>  top predictions are Japan and England, but it would be great to see somebody over there.</p>

    <p>[Breanna Lungo-Koehn]</a>:  <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1103.899">It</a>  will be on in my house, because my husband's a huge soccer fan. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1106.92">So</a>  he was up at 5 AM, I think it was Saturday morning, watching. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1111.441">And</a>  I'm like, you're crazy, because you had family over the night before. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1115.321">So</a>  he was right there with you, watching. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1118.202">I</a>  wish all the team the best of luck. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1120.202">It's</a>  great for our female athletes <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1123.473">just</a>  see role models. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1125.415">My</a>  one soccer player is my daughter, my middle child. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/1KTa31veCPwfZ4Z5r7rD88?t=1129.478">And</a>  yeah, it's great to have those role models for them.</p>
