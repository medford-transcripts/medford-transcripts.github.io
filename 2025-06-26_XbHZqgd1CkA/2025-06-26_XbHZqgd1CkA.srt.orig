[SPEAKER_10]: So please introduce yourself each time you speak.

12
00:01:18,338 --> 00:01:21,941
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd like to take a roll call attendance of the members.

13
00:01:22,982 --> 00:01:28,145
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me call you by name and then just say present.

14
00:01:29,526 --> 00:01:30,147
[SPEAKER_10]: Christy Dowd.

15
00:01:31,268 --> 00:01:31,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Present.

16
00:01:33,087 --> 00:01:33,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Blumberg.

17
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:39,470
[SPEAKER_10]: Deanna Peabody.

18
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:44,151
[SPEAKER_10]: And myself present chair.

19
00:01:45,812 --> 00:01:47,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Just remain name myself here.

20
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:52,895
[SPEAKER_10]: That

21
00:02:03,708 --> 00:02:03,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

22
00:02:03,968 --> 00:02:06,529
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have a small group of members today.

23
00:02:06,569 --> 00:02:10,110
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a couple are out on vacation, but we do have a quorum with four.

24
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:15,873
[SPEAKER_10]: So if any, any votes that we take today would have to be unanimous.

25
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:21,555
[SPEAKER_10]: We have the option of continuing items to a future meeting if that becomes an issue.

26
00:02:21,575 --> 00:02:24,396
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to give people a heads up about that.

27
00:02:26,793 --> 00:02:32,257
[SPEAKER_10]: First item on the agenda is the approval of minutes from the July meeting.

28
00:02:33,518 --> 00:02:41,744
[SPEAKER_10]: And any questions or comments, feedback, edits by any of the members about the minutes?

29
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:43,986
[SPEAKER_20]: Andre, this is David.

30
00:02:45,507 --> 00:02:50,591
[SPEAKER_20]: Clearly, there was a lot of effort that was put into the minutes.

31
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:56,275
[SPEAKER_20]: I just haven't had a chance to go through them and give them the attention that they really deserve.

32
00:02:56,614 --> 00:03:01,738
[SPEAKER_20]: credit to the city staff for putting as much into them this month as they did.

33
00:03:01,778 --> 00:03:03,039
[SPEAKER_20]: I thank them for that.

34
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,124
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think at this time, considering as well, we have four members to continue that would probably be the best move at this time.

35
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:17,370
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a motion to continue approval of the July minutes until the next meeting.

36
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:17,970
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a second?

37
00:03:21,553 --> 00:03:22,293
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Deanna.

38
00:03:22,514 --> 00:03:22,994
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll second.

39
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:32,074
[SPEAKER_10]: All those opposed, there'll be, I mean, in favor, I'll take the roll call.

40
00:03:32,114 --> 00:03:32,734
[SPEAKER_10]: Christy Dowd?

41
00:03:34,495 --> 00:03:34,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

42
00:03:35,876 --> 00:03:36,557
[SPEAKER_10]: David Blumberg?

43
00:03:37,377 --> 00:03:37,537
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

44
00:03:38,798 --> 00:03:39,359
[SPEAKER_10]: Anna Peabody?

45
00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:40,379
[SPEAKER_07]: Aye.

46
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,621
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm an aye as well.

47
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:49,045
[SPEAKER_10]: So unanimously, the minutes, approval of the minutes are continued to the next meeting.

48
00:03:49,806 --> 00:03:50,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, David.

49
00:03:51,627 --> 00:03:55,830
[SPEAKER_10]: And thank you, Amanda and staff for those detailed notes, because they are really

50
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:56,680
[SPEAKER_10]: really good.

51
00:03:57,561 --> 00:03:59,722
[SPEAKER_04]: All credit goes to Yvette on that one.

52
00:04:01,043 --> 00:04:01,603
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Yvette.

53
00:04:04,585 --> 00:04:18,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Next item on the agenda is the request for permit extension from BJ's Wholesale Club at 278 Middlesex Ave and 0 Middlesex Ave.

54
00:04:19,373 --> 00:04:21,194
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe we have Mark Vaughn of

55
00:04:22,794 --> 00:04:28,119
[SPEAKER_10]: Reimer Brownstein, LLP representing BJ's, excuse me if I mispronounced that, you can correct me.

56
00:04:29,159 --> 00:04:35,645
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you could, let's see if the staff can get you unmuted.

57
00:04:37,966 --> 00:04:38,407
[SPEAKER_13]: I am here.

58
00:04:39,288 --> 00:04:39,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

59
00:04:39,728 --> 00:04:40,248
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mark.

60
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:43,571
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, Mr. Chairman and members of the board.

61
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:45,072
[SPEAKER_13]: It's nice to see you all again.

62
00:04:45,092 --> 00:04:50,917
[SPEAKER_13]: It's been a while, but if you recall, I represent BJ's Wholesale Club in connection with their

63
00:04:51,974 --> 00:04:56,496
[SPEAKER_13]: proposed redevelopment at their existing facility on Middlesex Avenue.

64
00:04:57,737 --> 00:05:13,444
[SPEAKER_13]: Not to recreate history here, but we spent a lot of time about a year ago or so with the board getting special permit site plan approval for putting in a self-service fueling station and associated site improvements.

65
00:05:16,568 --> 00:05:18,969
[SPEAKER_13]: ended up getting that permit from the board.

66
00:05:18,989 --> 00:05:22,009
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe it was unanimous with one abstention, maybe.

67
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:27,571
[SPEAKER_13]: But since that time, we've been working through some other approvals.

68
00:05:28,131 --> 00:05:38,214
[SPEAKER_13]: As you may be aware, we did seek a fuel storage permit from the city council, and that was denied by the city council.

69
00:05:38,854 --> 00:05:41,855
[SPEAKER_13]: However, BJ has filed a

70
00:05:42,991 --> 00:05:56,638
[SPEAKER_13]: an appeal of that denial and that's what the Superior Court and is working its way through the process so I think this is really just a housekeeping item if I could Mister chairman of the context that under your zoning ordinances.

71
00:05:56,778 --> 00:05:58,599
[SPEAKER_13]: You do have a provision that a special permit.

72
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,662
[SPEAKER_13]: Granted under the provisions of zoning would lapse within one year.

73
00:06:05,463 --> 00:06:09,545
[SPEAKER_13]: Including such time required to pursue or wait the determination of the appeal.

74
00:06:10,213 --> 00:06:13,435
[SPEAKER_13]: referred to in section 94-38.

75
00:06:14,055 --> 00:06:25,042
[SPEAKER_13]: If a substantial use thereof is not soon or commenced except for good cause or in the case of a permit for construction, if construction is not begun by such date except for good cause.

76
00:06:25,082 --> 00:06:30,626
[SPEAKER_13]: So obviously we're not in a position to commence construction just given the ongoing appeal.

77
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:39,011
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have submitted a, I spoke with Alicia to request if we could just have the record document that

78
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:52,544
[SPEAKER_13]: the expiration for the special permit would not lapse for until a year after the full and final judicial resolution of the fuel storage permit.

79
00:06:56,667 --> 00:07:09,657
[SPEAKER_13]: I think under the statute alone, it is considered told, but just from housekeeping and to avoid any ambiguity in the future, we thought the better course of action would just be to document things appropriately

80
00:07:10,701 --> 00:07:15,344
[SPEAKER_13]: your board since you did spend a fair amount of time on this in the past, so thank you.

81
00:07:21,529 --> 00:07:23,591
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Attorney Vaughn.

82
00:07:24,271 --> 00:07:27,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, the board certainly spent a lot of time on this project.

83
00:07:27,714 --> 00:07:31,196
[SPEAKER_10]: We appreciate all your good work on it.

84
00:07:31,236 --> 00:07:34,459
[SPEAKER_10]: We were a little surprised by the events that happened afterwards.

85
00:07:37,744 --> 00:07:40,944
[SPEAKER_10]: Alicia, do we need to take an actual vote on this?

86
00:07:41,717 --> 00:07:48,621
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to comment that it's pretty, the request, the need for the request is pretty unusual.

87
00:07:48,721 --> 00:07:54,885
[SPEAKER_02]: The request was, we sort of poked and said, well, what did Medford do last time something like this happened?

88
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:57,867
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't have that example.

89
00:07:58,147 --> 00:08:07,933
[SPEAKER_02]: So we checked with our city solicitor, the city lawyer, and Paul Moki, the building commissioner, and they both said, this seems like exactly what that,

90
00:08:08,957 --> 00:08:22,260
[SPEAKER_02]: that phrase good cause is for in the ordinance, but that it would be, it was unclear whether I should give that extension administratively or the board should vote.

91
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:33,762
[SPEAKER_02]: So we said, let's just bring it to the board and ask them to just vote to extend it or to toll it until the administrative appeal is resolved.

92
00:08:35,237 --> 00:08:39,679
[SPEAKER_02]: So they would have one year after the resolution of the appeal to actually start construction.

93
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,481
[SPEAKER_10]: It's unclear whether we actually need to approve it.

94
00:08:43,501 --> 00:08:50,384
[SPEAKER_10]: So perhaps some motion along the lines of endorsing the permit extension would be appropriate.

95
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,345
[SPEAKER_10]: That'd be great.

96
00:08:53,631 --> 00:08:54,231
[SPEAKER_20]: Andre, this is David.

97
00:08:54,251 --> 00:08:54,951
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a question.

98
00:08:56,012 --> 00:09:10,200
[SPEAKER_20]: Just to clarify, is the effect of the tolling, or what Mr. Vaughan is suggesting, is it one year after this issue that's in front of some judiciary?

99
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:17,204
[SPEAKER_20]: When that's resolved, is it one year from that date, or is it, for instance, one year from our decision, but

100
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:26,618
[SPEAKER_20]: the period is told, or it just doesn't run during the period of the litigation over the city council's denial.

101
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:37,246
[SPEAKER_20]: So if four months ran before the city council said no, would you have eight months afterwards, or do you have the full 12 months after that decision comes back?

102
00:09:41,129 --> 00:09:42,310
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm an attorney myself.

103
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:44,371
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have that answer, but go ahead, Attorney Vaughn.

104
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:45,392
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure you have an opinion.

105
00:09:46,224 --> 00:09:59,312
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, respectfully, we would ask that it be a year after the resolution of the appeal, just so that we would then have sufficient time to mobilize and be able to move forward.

106
00:10:00,072 --> 00:10:15,122
[SPEAKER_13]: So if that would be the request, which I think makes sense, because we're probably not going to be in a position to just put shovels in the ground the day after the resolution.

107
00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:20,455
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, and if I could follow up then.

108
00:10:21,035 --> 00:10:21,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, please.

109
00:10:21,936 --> 00:10:25,919
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, do you have any concerns with that, David?

110
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:27,320
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess it sort of makes sense.

111
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:31,383
[SPEAKER_20]: It makes sense to me if it's all sort of tied into the same approval.

112
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:33,825
[SPEAKER_20]: I could definitely see that.

113
00:10:33,865 --> 00:10:47,216
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess my follow-up to Mr. Vaughn was just, are there other potential hurdles like this that BJ's is anticipating facing after this issue is resolved, presumably in your favor?

114
00:10:49,499 --> 00:10:56,925
[SPEAKER_20]: Could we see this issue again, or do you think this, after this point, you're pretty close to being able to go forward with the project?

115
00:10:58,606 --> 00:11:05,332
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think that that was the only permit that we had remaining, Mr. Bloomberg.

116
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:16,661
[SPEAKER_13]: We did end up getting a superseding order of conditions for the wetlands filing, so I don't believe that there's other permits and approvals out there that would be problematic in that regard.

117
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:17,622
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

118
00:11:18,863 --> 00:11:19,143
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

119
00:11:20,902 --> 00:11:21,663
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Christy.

120
00:11:21,763 --> 00:11:30,229
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, I hate to complicate things more, but I was the abstention in the original approval.

121
00:11:30,509 --> 00:11:38,694
[SPEAKER_06]: So just in terms of correct process requests, can I participate in a recommendation tonight on this?

122
00:11:41,656 --> 00:11:42,597
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see why not.

123
00:11:42,697 --> 00:11:44,158
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a separate vote.

124
00:11:44,698 --> 00:11:44,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

125
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:45,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Just wanted to make sure.

126
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:49,582
[SPEAKER_06]: I just didn't want to invalidate anything.

127
00:11:50,995 --> 00:11:52,516
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I did make a recommendation.

128
00:11:52,556 --> 00:11:52,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

129
00:11:58,001 --> 00:12:09,049
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions or is there a motion on the floor to endorse the permanent extension for a year after resolution of the appeal?

130
00:12:13,092 --> 00:12:13,653
[SPEAKER_20]: Andre, David.

131
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:38,521
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to present a motion to endorse the requests to provide one full year following judicial determination of the city council denial before our decision lapses.

132
00:12:39,982 --> 00:12:40,962
[SPEAKER_20]: I probably said that wrong.

133
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:49,799
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, David.

134
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a second?

135
00:12:54,501 --> 00:12:55,001
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll second.

136
00:12:56,561 --> 00:12:57,902
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call vote.

137
00:12:57,942 --> 00:12:58,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Christy Dowd?

138
00:12:58,482 --> 00:12:59,642
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

139
00:13:00,643 --> 00:13:01,283
[SPEAKER_10]: David Blumberg?

140
00:13:02,003 --> 00:13:02,143
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

141
00:13:03,043 --> 00:13:03,683
[SPEAKER_10]: Deanna Peabody?

142
00:13:04,424 --> 00:13:04,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

143
00:13:05,344 --> 00:13:06,524
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm an aye as well.

144
00:13:06,984 --> 00:13:08,785
[SPEAKER_10]: The motion unanimously passes.

145
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,107
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and board members.

146
00:13:13,207 --> 00:13:16,810
[SPEAKER_13]: And again, I hope you enjoy the rest of the summer and appreciate your time.

147
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:17,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

148
00:13:17,791 --> 00:13:18,792
[SPEAKER_13]: Same to you and best of luck.

149
00:13:19,412 --> 00:13:19,733
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

150
00:13:19,993 --> 00:13:20,233
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

151
00:13:20,713 --> 00:13:21,014
[SPEAKER_13]: Bye-bye.

152
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:33,445
[SPEAKER_10]: Next item on the agenda is a public hearing for a special permit site plan review application for 23 Sycamore Avenue.

153
00:13:38,633 --> 00:13:40,522
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll read the public hearing notice now.

154
00:13:40,924 --> 00:13:41,667
[SPEAKER_10]: City of Medford.

155
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:48,677
[SPEAKER_10]: Medford Community Development Board shall conduct a public hearing on Wednesday, August 11th, 2021 at 6 p.m.

156
00:13:48,717 --> 00:14:10,272
[SPEAKER_10]: via Zoom remote video conferencing relative to a special permit site plan review application submitted by Oxford Properties Group, DBA 23 Sycamore owner LLC to perform partial demolition and interior renovations of a building at 23 Sycamore Avenue to be occupied as a research and testing facility.

157
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:18,103
[SPEAKER_10]: This property is located in an industrial zoning district, and therefore the proposed use is allowed at this site.

158
00:14:19,224 --> 00:14:34,090
[SPEAKER_10]: A copy of the application may be viewed in the office of planning development and sustainability room 308 or on the city's website at www.medfordma.org under the planning department sub tab.

159
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:38,032
[SPEAKER_10]: And you can click on current CD board filings to find that.

160
00:14:50,824 --> 00:15:01,570
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe we have a proponent is here represented by Valerie Moore of Nutter McLennan and Fish LLP and can initiate the presentation with her team.

161
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,751
[SPEAKER_10]: If she could be unmuted.

162
00:15:03,771 --> 00:15:07,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman and members of the board.

163
00:15:08,772 --> 00:15:27,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Before proceeding with the hearing, because we are down a few board members tonight, can you confirm for me whether Medford has adopted the Mullen rule such that an absent board member could watch the recording of this and then be able to participate in a subsequent hearing?

164
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:33,984
[SPEAKER_10]: Alicia, do we have that?

165
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:36,966
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a citywide adoption.

166
00:15:38,556 --> 00:15:40,117
[SPEAKER_02]: that has been adopted.

167
00:15:40,137 --> 00:15:45,078
[SPEAKER_02]: I know other boards, I have experience with other boards doing that.

168
00:15:45,098 --> 00:15:47,498
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe this board has done this in the past as well.

169
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:51,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

170
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:55,420
[SPEAKER_05]: With that, I think we are comfortable going forward then.

171
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:07,423
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Valerie Moore from Nutter, McLennan & Fish, and I'm here tonight on behalf of Oxford Properties with their proposal for the redevelopment of the site at 23 Sycamore Avenue.

172
00:16:08,995 --> 00:16:17,077
[SPEAKER_05]: 23 Sycamore Avenue is an existing cold storage warehouse that was constructed in the late 1980s.

173
00:16:17,737 --> 00:16:36,961
[SPEAKER_05]: As part of this proposal, we'll be in the rather unusual position of taking a currently non-conforming building and making it more conforming by taking down parts of it that currently exceed the allowable lot coverage and exceed the allowable setbacks.

174
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:58,064
[SPEAKER_05]: on the property or before the board this evening, seeking a site plan, special permit, because we are proposing to change the use of the facility from the cold storage warehouse that it's been for the past several decades into a current good manufacturing practices facility.

175
00:16:58,544 --> 00:17:01,045
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no other zoning relief required.

176
00:17:01,185 --> 00:17:05,526
[SPEAKER_05]: So this will be the only relief that's required for the project to move forward.

177
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:12,852
[SPEAKER_05]: And with that, I will turn it over to Matt Haverty from Oxford Properties to tell you a little bit more about them.

178
00:17:15,694 --> 00:17:16,154
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, team.

179
00:17:16,174 --> 00:17:16,614
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure.

180
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:17,475
[SPEAKER_16]: Do I need to be unmuted?

181
00:17:18,396 --> 00:17:19,156
[SPEAKER_16]: Can you guys hear me?

182
00:17:19,777 --> 00:17:20,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, we can hear you.

183
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:21,198
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, great.

184
00:17:21,558 --> 00:17:21,778
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

185
00:17:21,878 --> 00:17:23,700
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, thank you very much, Valerie.

186
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,562
[SPEAKER_16]: And thank you, everyone, for allowing us to present to you today.

187
00:17:27,582 --> 00:17:32,106
[SPEAKER_16]: We're very happy to be here in front of this board and to be working with the city of Medford.

188
00:17:32,526 --> 00:17:33,847
[SPEAKER_16]: So far, the experience has been

189
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:39,062
[SPEAKER_16]: very collaborative in communication and we've appreciated every step of that process.

190
00:17:39,242 --> 00:17:58,416
[SPEAKER_16]: Oxford Properties is very excited about what potential this site has and like Valerie mentioned, it is a little atypical in the fact that we actually want to make the site a little better from how you actually experience it in terms of taking away square footage and trying to make it more of a functioning site that works for these purposes.

191
00:17:59,582 --> 00:18:01,783
[SPEAKER_16]: Just quickly, we have a couple slides here.

192
00:18:01,803 --> 00:18:10,068
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll talk a little bit about Oxford real quick, and then I'll talk a little bit about GMP facilities, but I don't want to bore you guys, so I'll cut through kind of a couple of the slides quickly.

193
00:18:10,108 --> 00:18:10,908
[SPEAKER_16]: They're a little dense.

194
00:18:11,368 --> 00:18:15,811
[SPEAKER_16]: If you guys have any questions, obviously ask me at any time, but I don't want to bore you.

195
00:18:15,851 --> 00:18:26,716
[SPEAKER_16]: So we usually leave with the fact that Oxford Properties Group is actually wholly owned subsidiary of OMERS, which is the Ontario Municipal Employee Retirement System, which has over 500,000

196
00:18:28,311 --> 00:18:32,373
[SPEAKER_16]: municipal employees in Toronto area with their retirement plan.

197
00:18:32,413 --> 00:18:43,057
[SPEAKER_16]: So we always talk about the pension promise and what it means to have long-term investments, to hold those investments and really to create value within that over the long-term life of the property.

198
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:56,203
[SPEAKER_16]: We have over $70 billion of assets globally, 150 million square feet through a mix of multifamily, life science, office, retail, industrial, hotels,

199
00:18:57,268 --> 00:19:00,770
[SPEAKER_16]: Our original headquarters is Toronto and remains our main headquarters.

200
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:07,414
[SPEAKER_16]: Our North America headquarters and the man that runs North America is out of our Boston office, which is where we are all out of.

201
00:19:08,414 --> 00:19:13,657
[SPEAKER_16]: But we have offices across the globe in Sydney, Singapore, Luxembourg, and London.

202
00:19:14,798 --> 00:19:15,718
[SPEAKER_16]: We can go to the next one.

203
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,380
[SPEAKER_16]: As you can imagine,

204
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:25,732
[SPEAKER_16]: As many have started to look at, life science has really been a focus for us for actually a long time.

205
00:19:25,772 --> 00:19:31,554
[SPEAKER_16]: It's been relatively infancy compared to some others that focused on that for the last 25, 30 years.

206
00:19:31,674 --> 00:19:37,336
[SPEAKER_16]: But we really started to get into it and put a lot of capital behind it in 2016.

207
00:19:37,376 --> 00:19:47,099
[SPEAKER_16]: And we believe it's very similar to how we run our office assets in that we believe in creating an ecosystem in our assets.

208
00:19:47,659 --> 00:19:48,299
[SPEAKER_16]: We believe that

209
00:19:48,948 --> 00:19:53,251
[SPEAKER_16]: you know, it's not just important to have these large companies that sit in these spaces.

210
00:19:53,291 --> 00:20:12,586
[SPEAKER_16]: You need to start with the incubator spaces, create opportunities for these young companies to get in, to grow into other areas, whether within your portfolio or others, to make room and try to create that kind of culture around what they talk about here is a lot of, you know, like campus style things in life science.

211
00:20:12,606 --> 00:20:14,847
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's really what we do on all of our different,

212
00:20:16,123 --> 00:20:17,744
[SPEAKER_16]: and all of our distant asset classes.

213
00:20:17,784 --> 00:20:18,884
[SPEAKER_16]: That's what we truly believe.

214
00:20:18,965 --> 00:20:24,848
[SPEAKER_16]: So in 2016, we started with some, you know, debt financing and biomed.

215
00:20:24,868 --> 00:20:28,149
[SPEAKER_16]: 2017, we bought a property in Boston that we're developing as 350,000 square feet of R&D lab.

216
00:20:28,209 --> 00:20:32,171
[SPEAKER_16]: In 2019, we started picking up more of the lab product, we bought 42 acres in the seaport.

217
00:20:37,888 --> 00:20:49,432
[SPEAKER_16]: We are in the middle of doing master planning on that right now that would be currently contemplated for 50% of the 6 million square feet to be some form of life science company use.

218
00:20:50,412 --> 00:20:56,174
[SPEAKER_16]: But we also, in the short term, we've done a lot of R&D uses in the current buildings.

219
00:20:56,414 --> 00:21:03,957
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we've been really focusing, kind of like I mentioned before, this ecosystem that we're trying to create is that

220
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:25,400
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, you get with the R&D folks that start early, they start testing some of their science, they start manufacturing it in a small component inside their R&D labs, but then when they start really breaking through, they need to go to a place that is either outsourcing GMP, like good manufacturing practice production, or

221
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:28,455
[SPEAKER_16]: they need to create big facilities for themselves to do that.

222
00:21:28,555 --> 00:21:41,565
[SPEAKER_16]: So we believe that by bringing those closer together and creating this, like we talked about an ecosystem of R&D, GMP, it really benefits everyone in the process.

223
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:48,791
[SPEAKER_16]: So these are just a sampling of projects that we have across the globe and that we've been running for quite a long time.

224
00:21:48,811 --> 00:21:50,652
[SPEAKER_16]: So we can go to the next one.

225
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,752
[SPEAKER_16]: So GMP facilities, you'll hear this term used a lot.

226
00:21:55,092 --> 00:22:01,557
[SPEAKER_16]: The real term that they like to be, you know, if you get into the scientist side of it, is really current good manufacturing practices.

227
00:22:02,137 --> 00:22:09,022
[SPEAKER_16]: And the reason they say that is that the current part is that these practices change significantly through different evolutions throughout the year.

228
00:22:09,482 --> 00:22:13,485
[SPEAKER_16]: And you always have to design to the current good manufacturing practice level.

229
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:23,110
[SPEAKER_16]: So typically anybody that does drugs, biologics, medical devices, and other therapies for any human use where they are manufactured, that's these facilities.

230
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:32,040
[SPEAKER_16]: Just a kind of interesting note, something that we learned while learning more and more about this product over the last five years, even if it's something like a cosmetic,

231
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:41,428
[SPEAKER_16]: that says that they have proven that they can reduce wrinkles or age-defying type cosmetic, they need to be produced in a current good manufacturing facility.

232
00:22:41,468 --> 00:22:51,319
[SPEAKER_16]: So just kind of interesting that anything that says there's a benefit to your life or to your, by using the product, it has to be done in accordance with these regulated under 21 CFR 210.

233
00:22:54,348 --> 00:22:57,150
[SPEAKER_16]: The FDA regulates, has the right to inspect them at any time.

234
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:06,956
[SPEAKER_16]: And then if you are manufacturing to other countries, say France, you have to actually abide by their CGMP regulations in addition to the USA's.

235
00:23:08,296 --> 00:23:11,858
[SPEAKER_16]: These typically range from early clinical to launch and manufacturing.

236
00:23:11,939 --> 00:23:14,760
[SPEAKER_16]: So just a quick kind of synopsis.

237
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,401
[SPEAKER_16]: Phase one is first in man.

238
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:20,924
[SPEAKER_16]: It's this very small group of patients that people are just testing their science on.

239
00:23:21,629 --> 00:23:24,450
[SPEAKER_16]: That does not happen in the type of facility that we are showing you today.

240
00:23:24,470 --> 00:23:28,051
[SPEAKER_16]: Phase two, you're typically getting to hundreds of patients.

241
00:23:28,752 --> 00:23:36,274
[SPEAKER_16]: It's again, you're basically taking the highest standard of care that is currently done to treat this, what you're trying to solve for, and you're comparing it against that.

242
00:23:36,955 --> 00:23:46,038
[SPEAKER_16]: And then you get into dosing, which is still done typically in a small pilot GMP facility inside your research and development office, where it's really up to thousands of patients.

243
00:23:46,663 --> 00:23:51,986
[SPEAKER_16]: But when we come in these facilities that are really a CGMP facilities, it's the launch in commercial manufacturing.

244
00:23:52,006 --> 00:23:56,168
[SPEAKER_16]: So this is when somebody has got approved, they need to build a facility.

245
00:23:56,228 --> 00:24:01,731
[SPEAKER_16]: It takes typically a year to just about a year and a half to get them commissioned after they've been built.

246
00:24:01,891 --> 00:24:07,454
[SPEAKER_16]: So make sure that they actually are adhering to these practices and then they're distributing large doses.

247
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:09,856
[SPEAKER_16]: Next slide.

248
00:24:12,437 --> 00:24:13,278
[SPEAKER_16]: So how are they different?

249
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:18,663
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys have started to see a lot of life science R and D facilities come your way.

250
00:24:19,484 --> 00:24:24,508
[SPEAKER_16]: These are slightly different in the fact that they are utility intensive and they require high reliability.

251
00:24:24,608 --> 00:24:34,576
[SPEAKER_16]: So, you know, in a lab, a typical lab, you may have 15 Watts per square foot for power that is needed only on that small portion of lab that is in that building.

252
00:24:36,077 --> 00:24:39,179
[SPEAKER_16]: Whereas in the building like this, you'll have 25 Watts per square foot.

253
00:24:39,199 --> 00:24:41,341
[SPEAKER_16]: So you have a significant amount of power that's required.

254
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:44,907
[SPEAKER_16]: you need dedicated security access control.

255
00:24:44,947 --> 00:24:49,370
[SPEAKER_16]: Those are similar, but where it differs is the lockers, the airlocks, the clean rooms.

256
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:55,373
[SPEAKER_16]: They are very specific about separating, even within the building, what is the clean area.

257
00:24:55,454 --> 00:25:00,076
[SPEAKER_16]: So when we talk about these buildings, there was an interesting quote in the city of Boston.

258
00:25:00,096 --> 00:25:12,764
[SPEAKER_16]: I had a meeting last week and there was an interesting quote that these buildings are actually cleaner than any other building in the city, like for the entire neighborhood, because they are required to follow certain practices within the building that don't allow it to get outside of these clean rooms.

259
00:25:13,255 --> 00:25:15,598
[SPEAKER_16]: and then there's more layers between that and the outside world.

260
00:25:17,721 --> 00:25:22,366
[SPEAKER_16]: Highly trained staff, waste is closely managed, and they're cleaner than any lab.

261
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,690
[SPEAKER_16]: So they're classified as cleanliness, which is a high level.

262
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:29,575
[SPEAKER_16]: The benefit of GMP tenants is an increased job market.

263
00:25:29,975 --> 00:25:36,839
[SPEAKER_16]: So we talk about high quality jobs with educated personnel, but there's also the significant impact of the blue collar workers, right?

264
00:25:36,879 --> 00:25:42,122
[SPEAKER_16]: The people that you're working with the scientists, but they are working in the manufacturing components of this facility.

265
00:25:42,202 --> 00:25:45,544
[SPEAKER_16]: So it really has a good benefit to the local job market.

266
00:25:46,685 --> 00:25:51,628
[SPEAKER_16]: Good neighbors, no noise, and we'll show you why, low odors and low emissions.

267
00:25:53,049 --> 00:25:54,510
[SPEAKER_16]: These companies are focused on health.

268
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,892
[SPEAKER_16]: They're trying to solve for many of the health issues that are out there today.

269
00:25:58,514 --> 00:26:01,817
[SPEAKER_16]: And they like to make sure that that resonates with the people that they have working for them.

270
00:26:01,897 --> 00:26:07,561
[SPEAKER_16]: So they try to provide facilities that are a step above in terms of health and well-being.

271
00:26:08,562 --> 00:26:11,905
[SPEAKER_16]: And then always they want to have extra potential, right, for expansion.

272
00:26:12,225 --> 00:26:14,327
[SPEAKER_16]: So you see these clusters that start to come up.

273
00:26:14,687 --> 00:26:24,375
[SPEAKER_16]: They want to have opportunities to grow locally so that they don't have to, you know, really jump around and go to different job, you know, workforces.

274
00:26:24,775 --> 00:26:25,836
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think it's great.

275
00:26:29,021 --> 00:26:36,127
[SPEAKER_16]: So some of the things you'll see what SGA will present shortly is that the design features are a large floor plate that can be very flexible.

276
00:26:36,788 --> 00:26:39,970
[SPEAKER_16]: They have ever-changing technologies, a very tall volume.

277
00:26:40,451 --> 00:26:43,994
[SPEAKER_16]: So at this building, we have 40 feet clear, which is what makes it desirable.

278
00:26:44,734 --> 00:26:53,362
[SPEAKER_16]: And what happens is, and one of the great benefits of the neighborhood is that they like to house all of their equipment for these units and for everything inside the building.

279
00:26:53,402 --> 00:26:55,704
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you can imagine a 40 foot high building

280
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:05,265
[SPEAKER_16]: 20 feet, we're going to put a mezzanine and there'll be actually units that are standing in there instead of adding units to the rooftop because they want to have quick maintenance to get right to them.

281
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:10,188
[SPEAKER_16]: Any lost minute is significant loss in productivity and potentially a loss of their science.

282
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:13,470
[SPEAKER_16]: So they want to have those units inside the building if possible.

283
00:27:13,610 --> 00:27:16,812
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's very important to them.

284
00:27:16,932 --> 00:27:18,873
[SPEAKER_16]: Sustainable features are really important to them.

285
00:27:19,033 --> 00:27:20,294
[SPEAKER_16]: High performance envelopes.

286
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:23,536
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we have critical components going on in there.

287
00:27:25,073 --> 00:27:31,514
[SPEAKER_16]: Structure, you'll see this with everybody, but large column spacing, even larger than what you want in the R&D world.

288
00:27:32,014 --> 00:27:35,115
[SPEAKER_16]: You want more than just the 33, you'd like to have larger than that.

289
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:39,756
[SPEAKER_16]: Flow loading, they like to have at a minimum 150 pounds per square foot.

290
00:27:40,476 --> 00:27:47,637
[SPEAKER_16]: And then floor vibration, typical like a lab building, they would want to have good floor vibration ratings.

291
00:27:49,357 --> 00:27:53,458
[SPEAKER_16]: So on the MEP side, like I mentioned, they have dedicated recirculating clean room

292
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:57,656
[SPEAKER_16]: air handling system with HEPA filters, and the room is pressurized.

293
00:27:57,696 --> 00:28:07,257
[SPEAKER_16]: So essentially, when you walk in, you have to be, anything that goes in, I guess I would just say it's the most sterile equipment.

294
00:28:07,297 --> 00:28:11,458
[SPEAKER_16]: When you see these people, and SGA will talk to it, it's an extremely sterile silence.

295
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:16,999
[SPEAKER_16]: And then they have standby power that is required to make sure there is no interruption and no loss of product.

296
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:22,400
[SPEAKER_16]: What you typically see, and SGA will talk to this, is raw materials are brought in,

297
00:28:22,938 --> 00:28:25,680
[SPEAKER_16]: They go into material storage, and they go to material prep.

298
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,501
[SPEAKER_16]: They go through a clean corridor.

299
00:28:28,362 --> 00:28:32,184
[SPEAKER_16]: Before they enter the clean room suite, the return corridor is actually clean as well.

300
00:28:32,644 --> 00:28:35,086
[SPEAKER_16]: And then they go into package and labeling, and they ship out.

301
00:28:35,526 --> 00:28:43,111
[SPEAKER_16]: And one of the benefits of what we have at 23 Sycamore is a significant amount of loading docks that allows for this separation to be even more pronounced.

302
00:28:43,191 --> 00:28:45,753
[SPEAKER_16]: So good moments for that.

303
00:28:45,773 --> 00:28:47,374
[SPEAKER_07]: Next slide.

304
00:28:51,117 --> 00:28:51,337
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

305
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,881
[SPEAKER_16]: And then why here, right?

306
00:28:54,981 --> 00:29:03,748
[SPEAKER_16]: So obviously Boston and Cambridge, the Seaport and Cambridge are really booming in terms of research and development.

307
00:29:03,848 --> 00:29:13,516
[SPEAKER_16]: And what we find is that the CEO headquarters really wants to be within 60 minutes of a car ride to get to their GMP facility or CGMP facility.

308
00:29:14,096 --> 00:29:20,922
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a lot of developments that we've got ongoing in the 128-495 belt, but what we really believe is that

309
00:29:21,408 --> 00:29:26,791
[SPEAKER_16]: Medford and the surrounding cities locally to Boston are much more attractive.

310
00:29:26,992 --> 00:29:43,402
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think if you look at even, you know, today in the newspaper at Boston Globe, and we've confidentially had some talks, but Greenlight Bio, a Medford company, right, is a research and development company that just had a huge breakthrough in the amount of science they will be able to do in the near future.

311
00:29:44,362 --> 00:29:47,805
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys have seen companies that have been growing within your city,

312
00:29:49,509 --> 00:29:54,493
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to provide them with the outlet to stay within that city or at least be close if they're in Somerville or Cambridge.

313
00:29:54,513 --> 00:30:05,401
[SPEAKER_16]: We want somebody to be able to choose Medford as a place that, you know, when I leave my office at 125 Summer in Boston, it takes me seven minutes to get out of my car at 23 Sycamore.

314
00:30:05,722 --> 00:30:09,625
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's something that none of these CEOs have, that proximity.

315
00:30:09,685 --> 00:30:13,668
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's why it's really important for us to look into these cities.

316
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:14,949
[SPEAKER_16]: And Medford is quite honestly,

317
00:30:15,962 --> 00:30:18,104
[SPEAKER_16]: We talked to Victor and his team before.

318
00:30:18,164 --> 00:30:19,866
[SPEAKER_16]: Bedford is one that is very high on our list.

319
00:30:19,886 --> 00:30:23,949
[SPEAKER_16]: We consider it to be a diamond in the rough right now in this world.

320
00:30:24,009 --> 00:30:26,772
[SPEAKER_16]: And we think it's a perfect opportunity for it.

321
00:30:26,812 --> 00:30:32,036
[SPEAKER_16]: So John, maybe I'll turn it over to you to go through the real details.

322
00:30:32,057 --> 00:30:39,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks, Pat.

323
00:30:39,783 --> 00:30:41,985
[SPEAKER_11]: We were going to start outside.

324
00:30:42,956 --> 00:30:46,357
[SPEAKER_19]: You start the site for us.

325
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:46,877
[SPEAKER_19]: Jump in there.

326
00:30:48,617 --> 00:30:49,918
[SPEAKER_19]: Next slide please thanks thanks John.

327
00:30:50,638 --> 00:30:51,538
[SPEAKER_19]: My name is Ken staff here.

328
00:30:52,258 --> 00:30:54,039
[SPEAKER_19]: The civil engineer working in this project.

329
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:58,280
[SPEAKER_19]: And so try to get you familiar with the site.

330
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,241
[SPEAKER_19]: The sick more of his off of Riverside.

331
00:31:02,841 --> 00:31:05,482
[SPEAKER_19]: And 23 sycamore is located just about mid block.

332
00:31:06,702 --> 00:31:10,063
[SPEAKER_19]: In to the east is the and I was a Bush facility.

333
00:31:10,932 --> 00:31:14,973
[SPEAKER_19]: and the rest of the neighborhood is generally industrial.

334
00:31:16,813 --> 00:31:18,833
[SPEAKER_19]: The site itself is about 3.3 acres.

335
00:31:19,393 --> 00:31:21,674
[SPEAKER_19]: Much of that is the main site covered by the building.

336
00:31:21,814 --> 00:31:33,216
[SPEAKER_19]: So as Valerie said, we don't currently meet the coverage, lot coverage allowances, and by demolishing portions of the buildings, we'll bring that into compliance.

337
00:31:33,896 --> 00:31:39,097
[SPEAKER_19]: The other portion of the site is along the railroad right-of-way that used to serve this,

338
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:40,870
[SPEAKER_19]: site here.

339
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:50,673
[SPEAKER_19]: So that's a railroad spur that served the site and part of it serves the Anheuser-Busch, but that extends to the north from the site and is included in that 3.3 acres.

340
00:31:51,133 --> 00:32:01,995
[SPEAKER_19]: We're not planning to do anything with that rail spur and we are trying to do our best to stay outside of that.

341
00:32:03,596 --> 00:32:05,496
[SPEAKER_19]: I think there's some other photos, John, if you want to go through those.

342
00:32:07,397 --> 00:32:08,177
[SPEAKER_19]: Next slide.

343
00:32:19,154 --> 00:32:32,798
[SPEAKER_19]: So these are just some photos showing the existing site, and I think this one does a pretty good job of showing, go back one, showing the portion of the building that's gonna be demolished to make way for the parking lot for the site.

344
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,459
[SPEAKER_19]: So yeah, right there, John.

345
00:32:35,479 --> 00:32:43,282
[SPEAKER_19]: So if you're looking at this, this is the older portion of the building with the four loading docks and some small office space up front.

346
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:46,483
[SPEAKER_19]: This is built right up to the abutting property

347
00:32:47,685 --> 00:32:49,907
[SPEAKER_19]: to the north, right up against that fence line.

348
00:32:50,467 --> 00:32:53,429
[SPEAKER_19]: And this portion will be demolished right beyond that brick building.

349
00:32:53,729 --> 00:32:59,753
[SPEAKER_19]: The taller facade in the rear is the newer cold storage facility, which is to remain in place.

350
00:32:59,793 --> 00:33:04,136
[SPEAKER_19]: So the existing footprint on site, the building is about 85,000 square feet.

351
00:33:05,277 --> 00:33:07,839
[SPEAKER_19]: The building, the portion that they're gonna demolish, it will be demolished.

352
00:33:07,859 --> 00:33:09,260
[SPEAKER_19]: It's about 25,000 square feet.

353
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,182
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's gonna open up the site for parking.

354
00:33:13,222 --> 00:33:13,923
[SPEAKER_19]: So as,

355
00:33:14,658 --> 00:33:25,024
[SPEAKER_19]: as Matt said, we're really trying to make the site more functional as a facility here that'll service the community and the folks working here.

356
00:33:26,044 --> 00:33:29,346
[SPEAKER_19]: So I want to go ahead and jump ahead to the site plan itself.

357
00:33:30,367 --> 00:33:33,028
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

358
00:33:33,048 --> 00:33:33,449
[SPEAKER_11]: It's okay.

359
00:33:33,489 --> 00:33:37,811
[SPEAKER_11]: This is jumping around on me a little bit, so let me just try to advance you to the site plan.

360
00:33:38,111 --> 00:33:38,672
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

361
00:33:38,692 --> 00:33:40,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Just some of the existing photos that Ken was describing.

362
00:33:43,221 --> 00:33:48,342
[SPEAKER_19]: I think one thing you'll see from those photos is that the site is pretty well built out to the edges.

363
00:33:48,862 --> 00:34:03,506
[SPEAKER_19]: And what we're trying to do as part of this is kind of pull it back, give ourselves a little bit more breathing room with the abutting properties with Sycamore Ave and try to open up and create a better project altogether.

364
00:34:05,546 --> 00:34:07,587
[SPEAKER_19]: So here's the current site plan.

365
00:34:08,727 --> 00:34:12,168
[SPEAKER_19]: This has been updated since the original submission based on

366
00:34:12,698 --> 00:34:25,506
[SPEAKER_19]: just the progress on the project itself and then responding to comments from planning staff and city staff, various different comments on the plans themselves.

367
00:34:27,608 --> 00:34:35,853
[SPEAKER_19]: So as I said, to the north of the building, the left side of the plan here, to the north of the building, that's the portion that'll be

368
00:34:36,509 --> 00:34:50,535
[SPEAKER_19]: demolished to make way for the parking lot, and it'll create the access point to the building as well, because there's really, there's no real entrance, and John can talk to that a little bit more, but there's really no entrance to the facility.

369
00:34:51,075 --> 00:35:06,261
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're looking to create about 100 parking lot, or 100 space parking lot, which will have one-way circulation through the lot, clearly defined by the arrows, counterclockwise through the site, one entrance in, one entrance out, that'll provide decent circulation into the site,

370
00:35:07,275 --> 00:35:15,482
[SPEAKER_19]: The parking, 100 spaces, would allow for up to, based on the city zoning, you know, you'd require one space for two employees.

371
00:35:15,502 --> 00:35:17,583
[SPEAKER_19]: So that would allow up to 200 employees.

372
00:35:18,084 --> 00:35:22,407
[SPEAKER_19]: And I think John had prepared a memo kind of stating that that would be the maximum you'd see here.

373
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:24,329
[SPEAKER_19]: It'd actually be a little bit less than 200 employees.

374
00:35:24,349 --> 00:35:29,813
[SPEAKER_19]: So there's more than adequate parking to service the facility in those who'll be working here.

375
00:35:31,974 --> 00:35:48,719
[SPEAKER_19]: The entrance to the site will be building itself is is tucked back into the site a little way so we tried to create connection to the parking lot to Sycamore Avenue to bring folks into the site so there's pedestrian connections from Sycamore Avenue to the site.

376
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,840
[SPEAKER_19]: And connecting to that to that entrance.

377
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:59,362
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of the other improvements I think we've looked at is and this is again some since we've submitted the plans have been some

378
00:36:00,150 --> 00:36:02,031
[SPEAKER_19]: updates to the site plans.

379
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,872
[SPEAKER_19]: And we're just trying to improve upon it.

380
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:12,375
[SPEAKER_19]: So one of the things that we looked at was the original plan, the parking was pretty close to Sycamore Ave and it was really tight.

381
00:36:12,395 --> 00:36:18,518
[SPEAKER_19]: There wasn't much room we could do with anything for landscaping or buffering for the parking along Sycamore Avenue in the new parking field.

382
00:36:19,338 --> 00:36:23,700
[SPEAKER_19]: Part of that was as a generator, existing generator that is needed for the site.

383
00:36:24,508 --> 00:36:32,729
[SPEAKER_19]: We work through and are relocating that generator into one of the loading bays, because as they said, we have plenty of loading bays here.

384
00:36:32,749 --> 00:36:38,310
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, the existing cold storage facility had 12 loading bays.

385
00:36:39,891 --> 00:36:42,531
[SPEAKER_19]: There'd be eight remaining in the portion of the facility that we have.

386
00:36:42,971 --> 00:36:45,132
[SPEAKER_19]: That's still more than what's needed.

387
00:36:45,812 --> 00:36:47,832
[SPEAKER_19]: City requires three per zoning.

388
00:36:47,992 --> 00:36:49,172
[SPEAKER_19]: We're going to provide six.

389
00:36:49,632 --> 00:36:53,253
[SPEAKER_19]: So by moving that generator into the loading bay,

390
00:36:53,781 --> 00:36:56,082
[SPEAKER_19]: It allowed us to do some things up at the Sycamore Ave.

391
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:02,684
[SPEAKER_19]: Driveways to enhance and improve the entrance experience.

392
00:37:02,864 --> 00:37:08,565
[SPEAKER_19]: And I'll let Nicole talk about that a little bit later.

393
00:37:08,725 --> 00:37:17,708
[SPEAKER_19]: Some of the changes that I think we've made as a result of comments back from various departments is, at least from the layout perspective,

394
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,462
[SPEAKER_19]: We've provided additional signage noting the one-way circulation.

395
00:37:22,902 --> 00:37:31,207
[SPEAKER_19]: We've added in some electric vehicle charging station and parking spaces.

396
00:37:31,227 --> 00:37:33,708
[SPEAKER_19]: We've added two spaces for electric vehicles.

397
00:37:34,668 --> 00:37:44,693
[SPEAKER_19]: And one of the things that kind of changed when we relocated that generator was the loading dock area did not need to be as wide as it is.

398
00:37:45,174 --> 00:37:45,654
[SPEAKER_19]: So today,

399
00:37:46,268 --> 00:37:52,974
[SPEAKER_19]: If you look down Sycamore Avenue from the southern edge of the loading dock to the northern edge.

400
00:37:54,075 --> 00:37:58,198
[SPEAKER_19]: There's just a sea of payments over a 150 feet from from edge to edge.

401
00:37:58,919 --> 00:38:08,587
[SPEAKER_19]: We're able to you know in the original plan to reduce that down to about a 120 feet wide and we're able to reduce it even further down to about a 100 feet creating a little bit tighter.

402
00:38:10,569 --> 00:38:13,892
[SPEAKER_19]: Curve cut there but at the same time also creating additional screening

403
00:38:15,603 --> 00:38:19,065
[SPEAKER_19]: and landscape potential across the front of the building in these locations.

404
00:38:19,545 --> 00:38:30,972
[SPEAKER_19]: And it also helps shorten up the pedestrian crossing through the loading dock area, which we've shown at the request, shown a crosswalk that's a little bit more visible than what we'd shown originally.

405
00:38:31,012 --> 00:38:34,634
[SPEAKER_19]: So the ladder type crosswalk to get pedestrians to and from.

406
00:38:34,654 --> 00:38:36,695
[SPEAKER_19]: And I would say that the other thing

407
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:46,496
[SPEAKER_19]: we've been able to do is create a sidewalk all the way across our frontage to help connect to the existing sidewalk that kind of ends at the Eastern, sorry, East Boston Savings Bank site.

408
00:38:47,056 --> 00:38:48,377
[SPEAKER_19]: And we carry that across our frontage.

409
00:38:48,397 --> 00:38:52,241
[SPEAKER_19]: So basically there's now a sidewalk that extends all the way down Sycamore Avenue.

410
00:38:52,261 --> 00:39:02,729
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, as we head South or to the right of the plan, we've eliminated the parking field that was in front of the building at that location.

411
00:39:02,749 --> 00:39:03,930
[SPEAKER_19]: There was about eight spaces there.

412
00:39:05,365 --> 00:39:08,851
[SPEAKER_19]: not very effective for us given the location, the building entrance.

413
00:39:09,892 --> 00:39:18,145
[SPEAKER_19]: And so we were able to take this area and as Matt said, there's a very utility intensive development.

414
00:39:18,265 --> 00:39:18,646
[SPEAKER_19]: And so

415
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:32,016
[SPEAKER_19]: We've been able to reconfigure some of the utilities and some of the comments we received from the departments were, you know, focusing on sewer water and making sure that we were providing the right configurations for each of those.

416
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:38,278
[SPEAKER_19]: And the plans have been updated to reflect those comments to address the sewer and water issues.

417
00:39:38,738 --> 00:39:43,020
[SPEAKER_19]: There's also, yeah, so we can flip to the plan.

418
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:46,801
[SPEAKER_19]: There's also a need for an upgrade in electricity service to the site.

419
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:54,508
[SPEAKER_19]: There'll be additional transformers on-site feeding from the existing utility lines feeding the site.

420
00:39:55,689 --> 00:40:04,236
[SPEAKER_19]: We said the upgrade to the water system, new sewer lines, and a new gas service to service the site.

421
00:40:05,276 --> 00:40:12,061
[SPEAKER_19]: There's also, because of the lab facility or that component, there's a need for gases

422
00:40:13,283 --> 00:40:17,697
[SPEAKER_19]: and so there's a there's there will be tanks located at the front of the building.

423
00:40:18,703 --> 00:40:20,805
[SPEAKER_19]: And these tanks are typical with lab spaces.

424
00:40:20,845 --> 00:40:28,751
[SPEAKER_19]: They'll be, you know, oxygen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and nitrogen, all things that are used in the lab.

425
00:40:29,792 --> 00:40:31,353
[SPEAKER_19]: And they'll be stored there.

426
00:40:32,153 --> 00:40:43,822
[SPEAKER_19]: We've worked to, you know, try to mask those as best we can, push them up against the building, meeting some of the minimum setbacks to the building, and creating a screen wall across that frontage, and then opening up

427
00:40:44,441 --> 00:40:49,643
[SPEAKER_19]: some area between the screen wall and Sycamore Avenue for some landscaping.

428
00:40:49,803 --> 00:40:52,804
[SPEAKER_19]: And again, I'll let Nicole kind of dig into that a little bit deeper.

429
00:40:52,824 --> 00:41:08,711
[SPEAKER_19]: And then last but not least, the stormwater, you know, the site has existing stormwater, much of the building flows to, much of the existing building to remain flows to the south plan right here and is

430
00:41:09,523 --> 00:41:12,964
[SPEAKER_19]: discharge into a swale detention system and is treated.

431
00:41:12,984 --> 00:41:16,584
[SPEAKER_19]: So now the portion of it discharges to a detention system in the loading area.

432
00:41:17,084 --> 00:41:20,465
[SPEAKER_19]: So then we need to, what we needed to do is look at the new parking field.

433
00:41:20,525 --> 00:41:22,265
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's no longer rooftop, it's parking.

434
00:41:22,285 --> 00:41:27,346
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's a little bit more, you know, potential for stormwater treatment.

435
00:41:27,866 --> 00:41:39,028
[SPEAKER_19]: So we've incorporated an infiltration system that collects the runoff from the parking area and provides treatment up to an inch through infiltration.

436
00:41:39,627 --> 00:41:44,729
[SPEAKER_19]: We have some preliminary numbers on the infiltration rates of the underlying soils.

437
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:50,412
[SPEAKER_19]: The actual location of the system is in the building.

438
00:41:50,772 --> 00:41:55,314
[SPEAKER_19]: So until that building is torn down, we were not able to do test pits in there to get the confirmation.

439
00:41:55,935 --> 00:41:59,216
[SPEAKER_19]: But everything's been designed with the lowest case.

440
00:42:01,236 --> 00:42:04,737
[SPEAKER_19]: the lowest potential infiltration rates, you know, allow for infiltration.

441
00:42:04,757 --> 00:42:13,541
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're, we're treating over an inch of runoff from that parking area before it discharges out to the Sycamore out of drain system.

442
00:42:14,021 --> 00:42:19,203
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that, that, that meets the MS4 standards in the city of Bedford standards for treatment.

443
00:42:19,863 --> 00:42:23,845
[SPEAKER_19]: And so that's, you know, a brief overview on the,

444
00:42:24,737 --> 00:42:25,778
[SPEAKER_19]: the site plans themselves.

445
00:42:25,798 --> 00:42:32,645
[SPEAKER_19]: I hope I captured all the different changes that we've made as a result of the peer review comments, which I think were helpful.

446
00:42:33,526 --> 00:42:36,489
[SPEAKER_19]: So with that, I'll turn it over to John.

447
00:42:37,169 --> 00:42:37,610
[SPEAKER_19]: No, I'm sorry.

448
00:42:37,670 --> 00:42:39,912
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll turn it over to Ryan so we can talk a little bit about traffic.

449
00:42:42,535 --> 00:42:43,035
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks, Ken.

450
00:42:44,544 --> 00:42:45,065
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, everybody.

451
00:42:45,125 --> 00:42:46,106
[SPEAKER_18]: My name's Ryan White.

452
00:42:46,426 --> 00:42:52,631
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a senior transportation engineer with VHB, and I led the transportation effort for this project.

453
00:42:52,832 --> 00:43:00,819
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to give you a very brief overview of the traffic and parking analysis that was done to support this project.

454
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:07,404
[SPEAKER_18]: Really, as part of this project, we completed and submitted a transportation impact study to the engineering division.

455
00:43:08,085 --> 00:43:09,386
[SPEAKER_18]: This has been reviewed.

456
00:43:10,947 --> 00:43:17,190
[SPEAKER_18]: and appropriate updates, as Ken just mentioned, to the site plan or responses to those comments were submitted.

457
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:31,078
[SPEAKER_18]: The change in building use is expected to produce a slight modification to both the number and types of trips to the site, really, as it changes from a warehouse use to a manufacturing use.

458
00:43:31,738 --> 00:43:36,881
[SPEAKER_18]: And I do just want to note that the traffic counts that were used as baseline conditions for this

459
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:43,470
[SPEAKER_18]: We're all taken from non-COVID historical accounts to take out any influences of the last 18 months or so.

460
00:43:44,552 --> 00:43:48,999
[SPEAKER_18]: Overall, the project is expected to have a minimal impact on the area roadways.

461
00:43:49,683 --> 00:44:00,107
[SPEAKER_18]: producing about 20 net new trips to the area network during the peak hour, so about a trip every three minutes or so to the overall area network.

462
00:44:00,788 --> 00:44:12,553
[SPEAKER_18]: While this is an increase in the total number of trips generated by the site, due to the change in the use of the site, the number of truck trips are expected to decrease

463
00:44:14,454 --> 00:44:24,206
[SPEAKER_18]: from the existing use that's on site, and we are confident that the six loading bays that are proposed will be able to accommodate the expected load.

464
00:44:24,827 --> 00:44:33,397
[SPEAKER_18]: And then as Ken mentioned, all parking will be accommodated on site with the expanded parking lot that is provided.

465
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:59,816
[SPEAKER_18]: However, as mentioned by all the changes to the site plan with the bike racks that are provided with the new sidewalk that's provided on the sidewalk connection to the front door of this building and the enhanced crosswalks, I think all these changes are really meant to promote the use of alternative modes to the site, although we've assumed a worst case condition in the analysis where everyone does drive.

466
00:45:01,297 --> 00:45:15,800
[SPEAKER_18]: the proponent is very, very much interested in promoting the use of those alternative modes, as Todd had mentioned, in a side of making sure that people that do want to ride bikes or take transit to this location do have the ability to do so.

467
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:25,301
[SPEAKER_18]: And with that, let me hand this over to the architects to talk about the nice renderings and design of this building.

468
00:45:25,861 --> 00:45:29,062
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey, Ryan, just to add on that a little bit, you know,

469
00:45:30,405 --> 00:45:39,408
[SPEAKER_16]: Oxford is very committed to sustainability and many different opportunities to make it so that people are using their bikes to transit.

470
00:45:39,968 --> 00:45:44,890
[SPEAKER_16]: Much like these companies, we are, I would say, at the forefront of those in Boston and globally.

471
00:45:45,970 --> 00:45:49,271
[SPEAKER_16]: So what we propose here is really the minimum of what we intend to do.

472
00:45:49,331 --> 00:45:52,393
[SPEAKER_16]: We expect to do more with that tenant.

473
00:45:52,433 --> 00:45:57,614
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to encourage them to do more, but just want to let you know that that's top of the mind as well.

474
00:45:57,634 --> 00:45:59,635
[SPEAKER_16]: I think when we first looked at this property in the beginning,

475
00:46:00,345 --> 00:46:03,968
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, we looked at how it had like some sidewalks that weren't continuous and things like that.

476
00:46:03,988 --> 00:46:05,268
[SPEAKER_16]: Those are very important to us.

477
00:46:05,288 --> 00:46:12,193
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just want to make that clear that we share your same concerns and we want to make sure that we're bettering the property that we have.

478
00:46:13,814 --> 00:46:14,255
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, go ahead.

479
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:17,461
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Matt.

480
00:46:18,262 --> 00:46:19,003
[SPEAKER_11]: And thank you, everyone.

481
00:46:19,023 --> 00:46:25,871
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is John Sullivan, architect with SGA, with Architects for the Project, working alongside Oxford and the project team.

482
00:46:26,612 --> 00:46:31,778
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, excited to share some of the concepts that we've been able to develop collectively.

483
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:47,210
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was just gonna start off, I know we've shared some existing imagery, and I think it's important, again, to just clarify, start with showing the building in its context, and really highlighting, if you can see my cursor, this portion of the building being demolished.

484
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:51,713
[SPEAKER_11]: So the building in its current form really takes up almost the entirety of the site.

485
00:46:52,254 --> 00:46:55,596
[SPEAKER_11]: This will be demolished, leaving about a 60,000 square foot footprint.

486
00:46:56,977 --> 00:47:02,959
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, which we think has great bones and, you know, really lends itself to this use in the right location.

487
00:47:02,999 --> 00:47:09,902
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, a lot of potential and Ken had described, you know, some of the edge conditions here that are, you know, it's a lot of pavement.

488
00:47:09,942 --> 00:47:18,185
[SPEAKER_11]: There's really no delineation between, you know, public realm and, you know, in the edge of the site.

489
00:47:18,245 --> 00:47:21,086
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have some exciting landscape concepts to share as well.

490
00:47:22,138 --> 00:47:23,179
[SPEAKER_11]: terms of the building itself.

491
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:30,849
[SPEAKER_11]: This is just an existing, you know, an existing plan of the of the building building in its current form again it's called storage warehouse.

492
00:47:32,692 --> 00:47:37,257
[SPEAKER_11]: You know this this portion of the building here to the page to the left of the page is

493
00:47:37,958 --> 00:47:54,207
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, is coming down, which leaves us, you know, it's rare probably that you see buildings coming in to become smaller in that way from a footprint standpoint, but it leaves us with a really good square, with a really good floor plate for, you know, for GMP use and just wide flexible spaces, you know, to allow the science to occur.

494
00:47:54,227 --> 00:47:56,808
[SPEAKER_11]: So just to try to highlight the demolition strategy.

495
00:47:58,171 --> 00:48:13,776
[SPEAKER_11]: And then looking at, you know, how we're thinking about the plan, you know, so we're trying to make this building, you know, very attractive to a tenant that, you know, that will see the potential in this space and see this as a place where they can, you know, achieve their scientific mission.

496
00:48:14,436 --> 00:48:19,337
[SPEAKER_11]: So the floor plate itself is really meant to be very wide open and very flexible.

497
00:48:20,658 --> 00:48:24,899
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, this is a big cold storage warehouse, so it's like that in its current form.

498
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:27,721
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's something that we intend to preserve.

499
00:48:27,761 --> 00:48:32,603
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we'll add in, we'll insert structure to support some of the mechanical uses that will happen within the building.

500
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:41,726
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think it is important to highlight a little bit of what Matt talked about in terms of how material moves in and out through the building and where some of the uses occur.

501
00:48:41,826 --> 00:48:46,648
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, we have the six loading docks that are being maintained along the street.

502
00:48:47,732 --> 00:49:02,704
[SPEAKER_11]: And that lends itself to having kind of a central place where, you know, material can come in, and then it goes through a very strict process before it enters into really the center zone where the clean rooms will occur and that's where the research and the production will happen.

503
00:49:03,285 --> 00:49:08,269
[SPEAKER_11]: And then material comes out, you know, again through a very controlled process back into

504
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,202
[SPEAKER_11]: know, an exiting load series of loading docks and then out of the site.

505
00:49:12,242 --> 00:49:18,565
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's really towards the middle of the plan here is where the clean rooms are and that's where the production happens.

506
00:49:18,585 --> 00:49:20,266
[SPEAKER_11]: There's some warehousing space.

507
00:49:20,326 --> 00:49:23,428
[SPEAKER_11]: The loading dock is, you know, is important in terms of its location.

508
00:49:23,988 --> 00:49:29,771
[SPEAKER_11]: And that really leaves the east side of the site or the area to the north available for office use.

509
00:49:29,871 --> 00:49:37,355
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's going to be workers that are doing work in the clean rooms that have space, you know, office space to return to that we think is going to happen here.

510
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:37,415
[SPEAKER_11]: So

511
00:49:38,455 --> 00:49:41,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, the building has, you know, it's very strong from a structural standpoint.

512
00:49:42,617 --> 00:49:44,418
[SPEAKER_11]: It has great open column bays.

513
00:49:44,778 --> 00:49:47,699
[SPEAKER_11]: It has a lot of height, and it really does lend itself to this use.

514
00:49:48,679 --> 00:49:54,882
[SPEAKER_11]: This facade, by way of the demolition, will need to be repurposed, so we have some images to share there.

515
00:49:55,182 --> 00:49:59,484
[SPEAKER_11]: But we're also intending to add in windows along different edges of the building to support the use inside.

516
00:50:00,444 --> 00:50:02,045
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, this is our main entrance that you'll see.

517
00:50:03,481 --> 00:50:19,310
[SPEAKER_11]: And then we showed a second level plan so this is a little bit of a mixed mix plan to Matt's point what's unique about these buildings and different from a typical lab building is that you know they're high volume spaces but within that within that space there's a floor added to support all of the mechanical needs that the tenant will.

518
00:50:20,430 --> 00:50:21,090
[SPEAKER_11]: be providing.

519
00:50:22,171 --> 00:50:31,774
[SPEAKER_11]: It's specific to their use, but what they look for is a wide open space in this mezzanine level to provide their specific controlled mechanical equipment within the building.

520
00:50:31,814 --> 00:50:34,334
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's what you see here in this gray zone.

521
00:50:34,815 --> 00:50:37,996
[SPEAKER_11]: And then what's left up above is also a second level of office space.

522
00:50:38,596 --> 00:50:45,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, this may flex a little bit depending on the tenant's exact needs, but we feel like this is really flexible for the types of companies that will work here.

523
00:50:47,884 --> 00:50:49,325
[SPEAKER_11]: And then just running around the building.

524
00:50:49,865 --> 00:50:56,246
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, what you see on the upper elevation is, you know, what you would see from Sycamore Ave.

525
00:50:56,306 --> 00:50:59,867
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's, again, it's a much smaller building compared to what it is currently.

526
00:51:01,048 --> 00:51:04,149
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is really a cleaned up version of that front facade.

527
00:51:04,269 --> 00:51:10,630
[SPEAKER_11]: And the goal is really to, you know, provide a coating, clean it up, really treat it with landscaping and screening.

528
00:51:11,991 --> 00:51:16,012
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, just, you know, respond to how the building is now organized.

529
00:51:16,485 --> 00:51:22,071
[SPEAKER_11]: The main opportunity for facade intervention is really along the north facade, which faces the parking lot.

530
00:51:22,965 --> 00:51:26,467
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have a rendering to share of this facade, but this facade is entirely new.

531
00:51:26,487 --> 00:51:30,830
[SPEAKER_11]: We're adding in windows in some of the science space, but also in some of the office space.

532
00:51:31,370 --> 00:51:40,195
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a main entry where we have, you know, a larger glassy element to really welcome people to the site and express it in a way that speaks to science and speaks to technology.

533
00:51:40,215 --> 00:51:50,802
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, you know, through, you know, material and color, you know, really a way to break down this longer facade into something that we think is very welcoming as people are going to approach the site.

534
00:51:52,257 --> 00:52:03,817
[SPEAKER_11]: And then just moving around the other sides of the site again, this is an existing building so these interventions are meant to be, you know, minor in a way, but by way of the program inside of adding in this is the.

535
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:09,624
[SPEAKER_11]: This is the east side of the site, kind of facing the rear of the site from Sycamore Avenue.

536
00:52:09,664 --> 00:52:15,286
[SPEAKER_11]: And by adding in the office space on two levels, that gives us an opportunity to punch in some windows, provide some vertical elements.

537
00:52:15,346 --> 00:52:18,647
[SPEAKER_11]: It really does provide a rhythm around this back facade.

538
00:52:19,127 --> 00:52:23,749
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, this is meant to facilitate the use, but also to improve the existing building.

539
00:52:24,169 --> 00:52:27,230
[SPEAKER_11]: And then some of that language carries along to the side of the site.

540
00:52:27,690 --> 00:52:41,996
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, minimal interventions but we think positive ones, and then on the north side of the site that's where we know that's where we really had the opportunity to create a new, a new feeling for for this building so that's what you see here, you know, this is, you know, gives you a sense of.

541
00:52:43,475 --> 00:52:45,116
[SPEAKER_11]: the new facade that faces the parking.

542
00:52:45,136 --> 00:52:53,339
[SPEAKER_11]: This is really tied into the way people would be entering the building every day as employees or visitors or people coming from their lab space in nearby cities.

543
00:52:54,459 --> 00:53:06,103
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, the goal here is to break down this longer facade with these vertical windows and this wrapping element that really captures and kind of terminates the entry and main arrival point.

544
00:53:06,143 --> 00:53:09,945
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is meant to be glassy, a really open expression to

545
00:53:11,645 --> 00:53:19,929
[SPEAKER_11]: to welcome people into the space and supported by some of the planting, ramping, and landscape interventions that are happening around it.

546
00:53:20,849 --> 00:53:27,412
[SPEAKER_11]: And then you can see some of the material changes as we push out towards the street to form a little bit more of a visual marker.

547
00:53:27,432 --> 00:53:28,812
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're excited by this.

548
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:31,794
[SPEAKER_11]: We feel like it's something that science companies will respond well to.

549
00:53:31,814 --> 00:53:39,457
[SPEAKER_11]: It speaks to technology, and it does really afford us an opportunity to create a really positive experience as people arrive on site.

550
00:53:41,073 --> 00:53:46,356
[SPEAKER_11]: So with that, I will pass it over to our colleagues at Copley-Wolf to talk about some of the site improvements.

551
00:53:50,098 --> 00:53:50,458
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

552
00:53:50,498 --> 00:53:50,898
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.

553
00:53:50,918 --> 00:53:52,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you hear me okay?

554
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:53,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.

555
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:54,881
[SPEAKER_03]: My name's Nicole.

556
00:53:54,921 --> 00:53:55,881
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm with Copley-Wolf.

557
00:53:56,141 --> 00:53:58,302
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the landscape designer working on this project.

558
00:53:58,963 --> 00:54:04,906
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I'll do is take you on a, just a quick entry sequence tour of how things are working on the site.

559
00:54:05,758 --> 00:54:16,863
[SPEAKER_03]: So since we are working with an industrial area and we do have quite a bit of utilitarian activity happening at the front of the site, we'll start here at the entry at Sycamore Avenue.

560
00:54:18,503 --> 00:54:22,645
[SPEAKER_03]: We are looking at how we can start to screen this area.

561
00:54:22,685 --> 00:54:26,907
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have quite a bit happening with the tank farm, the transformers, and the generator.

562
00:54:27,812 --> 00:54:46,682
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking at bringing in evergreen screening shrubs, we're looking at bringing in lower plantings that start to give a bit of a softening edge, and then additionally bringing in some graphic screening walls in front of the tank farm that's then also buffered by more shrubs, perennials of that nature.

563
00:54:48,222 --> 00:54:54,266
[SPEAKER_03]: As you cross the loading zone area, we get to our main entry and we have another screen wall.

564
00:54:54,606 --> 00:54:59,128
[SPEAKER_03]: These screen walls are also opportunities for graphic signage for some of the tenants.

565
00:54:59,589 --> 00:55:10,154
[SPEAKER_03]: So it helps to liven up the space and starts to speak to the facade and the architectural elements that are happening with the building, making that landscape architecture connection.

566
00:55:11,455 --> 00:55:14,517
[SPEAKER_03]: As you come to our parking lot entry,

567
00:55:15,425 --> 00:55:18,988
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcomed by a monument sign with planting and lighting.

568
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:32,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Coming into our parking lot area, we do start to bring in more of our parking lighting, as well as a fence element along the left side of the page here, just abutting to the next door neighbor there.

569
00:55:34,259 --> 00:55:41,685
[SPEAKER_03]: As you come in further, we've got several areas where we can bring in more of the parking lot trees,

570
00:55:42,526 --> 00:55:46,549
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big piece of how we're going to start to bring a little bit more shade into this area.

571
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:55,717
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the nice things about being able to work with the removed building is it is affording us the opportunity to bring in quite a bit more planting than what is currently there.

572
00:55:57,678 --> 00:56:05,544
[SPEAKER_03]: As you come to the main entry of the building, we start to set off this space with different paver patterns.

573
00:56:05,825 --> 00:56:08,727
[SPEAKER_03]: And the main piece of this is also how you get into the building.

574
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:14,080
[SPEAKER_03]: There's about a three and a half foot change in height from parking lot level into the building.

575
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:18,902
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have a series of stairs, as well as an ADA accessible ramp.

576
00:56:19,763 --> 00:56:30,147
[SPEAKER_03]: That ramp is comprised of walls, as well as plantings that help to welcome you into the space, as well as a few bench seating options.

577
00:56:30,707 --> 00:56:36,310
[SPEAKER_03]: When you start to go around to the back of the site, this area is where we have an existing railroad spur.

578
00:56:37,225 --> 00:56:55,395
[SPEAKER_03]: The tracks are not something that we're going to be working with, but we do want to bring in more opportunities for ornamental trees, larger trees where there's space to start to bring in more shade opportunities and ecosystem services with cooling and a little bit more habitat in the area.

579
00:56:55,415 --> 00:56:57,956
[SPEAKER_03]: So next slide, please.

580
00:57:02,956 --> 00:57:29,845
[SPEAKER_03]: When this starts to speak to a little bit of the materiality of the space, we are looking at, as I had mentioned, for our entry sequence with the paving options, how do we set this apart from a lot of the more concrete spaces to make that an entry that's welcoming, looking at a little bit of an upgraded presence of pavers, bicycle racks, so that, as mentioned, we can start to encourage definitely more modes of transportation,

581
00:57:31,097 --> 00:57:35,041
[SPEAKER_03]: This is lower left is a sample of the fencing that we could be using.

582
00:57:35,061 --> 00:57:43,828
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're also looking at decorative concrete board form walls in this area, kind of to soften things up, warm it up a touch.

583
00:57:45,029 --> 00:57:52,216
[SPEAKER_03]: And our bench, this is just a nod to that rustic industrial look that we're looking at in this area.

584
00:57:53,016 --> 00:57:53,637
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide, please.

585
00:57:59,547 --> 00:58:05,409
[SPEAKER_03]: And lastly, this is just a sampling of some of the plants that we're starting to consider for the site.

586
00:58:06,929 --> 00:58:15,412
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have both some larger areas, we want to bring in shade trees evergreen screening and some smaller ornamental trees.

587
00:58:15,953 --> 00:58:22,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that as we're at the outer edges of the site, we'll see some of the larger plantings that are a little bit more loose.

588
00:58:22,175 --> 00:58:37,800
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we get closer into the main entry with the monument sign and the stair and entry ramp, we'll get into some of our smaller varieties that have a little bit more form and a little bit more compactness to them.

589
00:58:38,601 --> 00:58:42,622
[SPEAKER_03]: Our hope is that we can bring in quite a bit of native plants.

590
00:58:43,424 --> 00:58:51,427
[SPEAKER_03]: bring in those ecosystem services, a little bit more habitat to the area, and they just help to soften the look and make it a lively space.

591
00:58:52,288 --> 00:58:54,448
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that, I will hand it back to the team.

592
00:59:03,992 --> 00:59:08,334
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead, Valerie.

593
00:59:08,494 --> 00:59:09,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Nicole.

594
00:59:10,155 --> 00:59:11,095
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that

595
00:59:11,665 --> 00:59:18,169
[SPEAKER_05]: concludes our presentation and we'd be happy to answer any questions that the board has.

596
00:59:19,971 --> 00:59:20,391
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

597
00:59:20,431 --> 00:59:27,375
[SPEAKER_10]: Appreciate the team's presentations and

598
00:59:28,580 --> 00:59:51,276
[SPEAKER_10]: At this time, I'd like to, in terms of the order of the public hearing, I'd like to invite a couple of the city staff who are with us tonight to give some of their feedback and then to take questions and comments from the board, and then we'll open up the public hearing to public participation.

599
00:59:53,357 --> 00:59:56,039
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I think we have,

600
00:59:58,122 --> 01:00:02,245
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if Tim McGivern is, yep, Tim is here and Todd Blake.

601
01:00:02,945 --> 01:00:07,148
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm wondering if Tim, you might provide some feedback.

602
01:00:07,188 --> 01:00:19,055
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if you've had the chance to kind of assimilate any of the changes that have been made, but we'd love to hear your feedback about the utility situation.

603
01:00:22,917 --> 01:00:23,137
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

604
01:00:23,157 --> 01:00:23,538
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, Andre.

605
01:00:24,118 --> 01:00:24,618
[SPEAKER_12]: Good morning, members.

606
01:00:26,694 --> 01:00:36,814
[SPEAKER_12]: So I did get a chance to quickly see the revised drawings and it looks like, and I think Ken from BHB went over.

607
01:00:37,763 --> 01:00:41,105
[SPEAKER_12]: some of the changes that I pointed out that I wanted to see.

608
01:00:41,185 --> 01:00:43,846
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was good to see that proactiveness.

609
01:00:45,007 --> 01:00:47,868
[SPEAKER_12]: From a utility standpoint, I didn't have any major comments.

610
01:00:47,908 --> 01:00:51,170
[SPEAKER_12]: Really, they just needed to reconfigure the way they had the water service set up.

611
01:00:53,271 --> 01:00:59,214
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, you know, some minor tweaks to the stormwater and some details for the plans, things like that.

612
01:00:59,234 --> 01:01:03,056
[SPEAKER_12]: And I also noticed that they shortened up that curb cut from 120 feet to about 100.

613
01:01:03,096 --> 01:01:06,137
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was a concern I had as well.

614
01:01:06,317 --> 01:01:07,198
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm glad to see that.

615
01:01:08,939 --> 01:01:14,525
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I did want to just bring to the attention that Sigma Avenue is a dead end waterline.

616
01:01:14,545 --> 01:01:23,714
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think much can be done in this project, but it's worth noting, I think, which is why I put it in my review, that this spur parcel is

617
01:01:25,288 --> 01:01:38,532
[SPEAKER_12]: You know it doesn't look like it's used I don't know if there is a use for it, but if there is ever any potential need for increasing water supply quality or anything like that, then this would be the owner of that spur parcel spur parcel and there's a potential connection over in Benjamin circle.

618
01:01:39,073 --> 01:01:42,877
[SPEAKER_12]: But there's another landowner in Benjamin Circle that would need to be involved with that too.

619
01:01:42,957 --> 01:01:48,683
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's just something to know that is there as far as development goes in this area.

620
01:01:49,343 --> 01:01:56,410
[SPEAKER_12]: And just sort of bring it to the attention of the landowner as well for any future talks that may involve.

621
01:01:56,750 --> 01:02:00,314
[SPEAKER_12]: It would benefit, you know, something that would benefit everybody that's connected to the water system.

622
01:02:02,016 --> 01:02:02,836
[SPEAKER_12]: But besides that,

623
01:02:05,022 --> 01:02:08,204
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't have really nothing, you know, nothing major besides typical things.

624
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:22,315
[SPEAKER_12]: They calculated their sanitary flow using portable water, which is fine, but I just need the calculation done in a different way to confirm that they are under certain thresholds for things like II and other elements.

625
01:02:22,475 --> 01:02:24,496
[SPEAKER_12]: So, but besides that, pretty straightforward.

626
01:02:24,536 --> 01:02:26,598
[SPEAKER_12]: And this looks like a good project and excited to see it.

627
01:02:31,883 --> 01:02:38,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you Mister mcgivorn it's a Blake I'm wondering if you could speak a little bit to the transportation.

628
01:02:40,690 --> 01:02:43,192
[SPEAKER_10]: Aspect of the project and changes that have been made.

629
01:02:45,073 --> 01:02:46,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure thank you Mister chair.

630
01:02:48,647 --> 01:02:53,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, as the project proponent mentioned there's some additional new trips added to the network.

631
01:02:55,253 --> 01:03:01,499
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, about 20 in each peak hour and then I think it's an increase of about 130% daily.

632
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:05,102
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a result, I recommended some mitigation.

633
01:03:07,744 --> 01:03:22,992
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the proponents did a good job of revising the site plan with some minor tweaks based on some of the comments that I provided, like the electric charging stations, making sure the bicycle parking is enough, and also recommendations regarding covering the bicycle parking and looking into that.

634
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:27,015
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of recommendations off-site, I had provided

635
01:03:28,289 --> 01:03:44,720
[SPEAKER_01]: two options essentially one providing some bicycle infrastructure via striping and signage on Riverside Ave in the block you know nearest the development or to provide increased pedestrian access to the transit stops nearby by providing

636
01:03:45,460 --> 01:03:51,904
[SPEAKER_01]: accessible wheelchair ramps and crosswalk markings across Sycamore as well as across Riverside.

637
01:03:52,445 --> 01:03:58,368
[SPEAKER_01]: The crosswalk across Riverside would be subject to traffic commission approval, but they've been pretty supportive of that sort of thing.

638
01:03:58,969 --> 01:04:04,132
[SPEAKER_01]: And it would line up very well with this development and the two transit stops that exist on Riverside Ave.

639
01:04:04,492 --> 01:04:12,938
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the comment response by the proponent had indicated that they were favoring that ladder option, the crosswalk option versus the bike lane option.

640
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:24,052
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think they're two good improvements to try to improve, increase the amount of non-vehicle mode share to the site.

641
01:04:24,252 --> 01:04:27,234
[SPEAKER_01]: And it does help the overall community as well as them.

642
01:04:27,595 --> 01:04:43,746
[SPEAKER_10]: And Todd, does that also include a crosswalk across, I don't believe there's a crosswalk there right now across Sycamore Ave, so that pedestrians walking along Riverside Ave crossing the Sycamore opening?

643
01:04:45,945 --> 01:04:47,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it would also be stripes.

644
01:04:47,746 --> 01:04:57,032
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe I wrote it as such to provide that crosswalk continuing the sidewalk along Riverside Ave crossing Sycamore as well as one crossing Riverside.

645
01:04:57,472 --> 01:04:57,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.

646
01:05:02,856 --> 01:05:04,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

647
01:05:04,176 --> 01:05:07,058
[SPEAKER_10]: We have a couple of other city staffers here.

648
01:05:07,078 --> 01:05:11,281
[SPEAKER_10]: I see Victor Schrader, Economic Development Director.

649
01:05:11,301 --> 01:05:12,682
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, Victor, do you want to say anything?

650
01:05:16,525 --> 01:05:18,066
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, thank you, Andre.

651
01:05:19,788 --> 01:05:21,249
[SPEAKER_17]: Oxford's been great to work with.

652
01:05:21,289 --> 01:05:22,610
[SPEAKER_17]: Their team's been great to work with.

653
01:05:22,670 --> 01:05:33,438
[SPEAKER_17]: It's nice to have a quality developer that's thinking through the types of things that we want to see as properties are improved.

654
01:05:33,578 --> 01:05:38,202
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's been very positive and, as Matt said, collaborative.

655
01:05:38,702 --> 01:05:39,683
[SPEAKER_17]: So we appreciate that.

656
01:05:40,564 --> 01:05:45,047
[SPEAKER_17]: On the life science side, this is something I think the board has heard.

657
01:05:46,081 --> 01:05:52,747
[SPEAKER_17]: from us, the staff, is thinking about this industry more as an opportunity for growth in Medford.

658
01:05:52,807 --> 01:06:05,919
[SPEAKER_17]: And so just unrelated directly to this project, but tangential is some conversations that the Board of Health is having that our department's working on to upgrade some...

659
01:06:10,227 --> 01:06:17,052
[SPEAKER_17]: use the word regulation loosely, just some, you know, some engagement with this industry as it grows in Medford.

660
01:06:17,672 --> 01:06:22,556
[SPEAKER_17]: There really is very limited oversight on the books today.

661
01:06:22,676 --> 01:06:37,746
[SPEAKER_17]: So the Board of Health is looking at some opportunities to just ask folks to register with the Board of Health, let us know what they're doing, and potentially create a sort of an advisory group to the Board of Health

662
01:06:39,402 --> 01:06:40,583
[SPEAKER_17]: related to life science.

663
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:56,696
[SPEAKER_17]: And so we're supporting that and we'll certainly let Oxford, the team know, and others that are interested in developing life science at Medford, make them aware of these types of policy changes.

664
01:06:57,236 --> 01:07:00,239
[SPEAKER_17]: So I think that's a positive thing.

665
01:07:00,399 --> 01:07:08,145
[SPEAKER_17]: Most of our neighbors in the area, in the region, have policies on the books like this.

666
01:07:08,704 --> 01:07:11,527
[SPEAKER_17]: We're just kind of catching up in a way, so.

667
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:14,129
Great.

668
01:07:14,349 --> 01:07:15,130
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Schrader.

669
01:07:16,812 --> 01:07:19,614
[SPEAKER_10]: Alicia Hunt, I don't know if you want to say anything directly.

670
01:07:19,655 --> 01:07:26,601
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have to, or if there's anybody else from the city that wants to say something before we go to the board.

671
01:07:26,621 --> 01:07:31,686
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Andre.

672
01:07:33,084 --> 01:07:40,527
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, uh, I don't know if the proponents know that my particular specialty besides being the director is actually sustainability.

673
01:07:40,547 --> 01:07:56,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I noted several times the mention of sustainable, and I took that to mean, and I want to make sure I was clear, uh, energy efficiency, because it was referred to as sustainable in order to reduce the size of mechanical equipment.

674
01:07:56,434 --> 01:08:02,116
[SPEAKER_02]: So was I correct in understanding that during the presentation that you were going for very efficient building?

675
01:08:04,695 --> 01:08:06,156
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that is correct, Alicia.

676
01:08:06,196 --> 01:08:14,422
[SPEAKER_16]: We understand, you know, in talking to you previously, like it still sticks in our mind that solar is an important part of, you know, what we've talked about.

677
01:08:14,462 --> 01:08:27,371
[SPEAKER_16]: We are, I wish I had the stat here, we just globally, we're one of the first, one of the first organizations to be considered like sustainable and well fit for all our properties as a global practice.

678
01:08:27,391 --> 01:08:27,731
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think

679
01:08:29,008 --> 01:08:35,470
[SPEAKER_16]: We are going to be working, and I understand we're a core and shell, and we need to wait for our tenant to kind of help enforce that they do this as well.

680
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:43,452
[SPEAKER_16]: But we'll be working hand in hand with you to make sure that we do the most efficient building and that we're pushing those practices as much as possible.

681
01:08:43,472 --> 01:08:49,594
[SPEAKER_16]: Like we did mention, the mechanicals on this roof should be pretty light, which allows for a good opportunity to do that.

682
01:08:49,794 --> 01:08:53,255
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think we're looking forward to working with you and your team on that project.

683
01:08:54,075 --> 01:08:54,675
[SPEAKER_02]: That'd be great.

684
01:08:54,896 --> 01:08:55,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

685
01:08:55,336 --> 01:09:10,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I we've we work closely with Cambridge on some of the guidelines that in consideration around you know net zero buildings and I'm fully aware that life science is the last place to go net zero because of the heavy energy intensive use of the buildings.

686
01:09:11,384 --> 01:09:16,106
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is, we're sort of following the Cambridge's conversations with that.

687
01:09:17,226 --> 01:09:30,432
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm very understanding that we can't go, we're not prepared to go net zero right off the bat, but that's, you know, we are looking at out 2030, 2050 kind of stuff and to be future proofing our buildings here.

688
01:09:31,552 --> 01:09:32,973
[SPEAKER_02]: So we do appreciate it.

689
01:09:32,993 --> 01:09:46,742
[SPEAKER_02]: And frankly our transport, I often have comments about transportation but our transportation director is so thorough that I could not possibly improve on what he's already mentioned here.

690
01:09:46,762 --> 01:09:47,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I think

691
01:09:47,878 --> 01:09:52,781
[SPEAKER_02]: A question that will pop up, I noticed your willingness to include EV parking, which I think is great.

692
01:09:53,341 --> 01:10:11,672
[SPEAKER_02]: So whether you guys have a standard for how you do that, whether it is proprietary to the employees, if there's opportunities for other people to use those charging stations, if the building is closed at night, stuff like how that might work.

693
01:10:12,393 --> 01:10:13,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly, I'm curious.

694
01:10:13,493 --> 01:10:15,655
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the kind of question we do get from residents.

695
01:10:17,111 --> 01:10:27,679
[SPEAKER_16]: That's a great question, and I think we'll work to address it better, but I'll give you a quick answer is that most of our EV stations have been inside of buildings and parking garages that allow for us to allow for it to be secure.

696
01:10:28,500 --> 01:10:38,547
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think we would be open to that thought as long as we could do it in a safe and secure manner to allow for that not to just be an area that, you know, becomes a danger zone for anybody.

697
01:10:38,587 --> 01:10:41,129
[SPEAKER_16]: So we want to make sure we do that in the right way, but I think there's a way to do it.

698
01:10:42,950 --> 01:10:43,591
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that

699
01:10:44,555 --> 01:11:00,624
[SPEAKER_02]: the way you could imagine that there might be neighbors who could walk in from there from the backs, but it's unclear to me whether or not there would be walking connections or if this would just be too far, practically speaking.

700
01:11:00,645 --> 01:11:04,407
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you're one building away from houses, but the road doesn't connect through.

701
01:11:06,007 --> 01:11:08,508
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just put it out there as something to consider.

702
01:11:08,588 --> 01:11:14,271
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been getting requests to start to locate EV charging stations in more parts of the city.

703
01:11:14,591 --> 01:11:16,412
[SPEAKER_02]: We're exploring creative ways to do that.

704
01:11:16,432 --> 01:11:17,792
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that's great.

705
01:11:17,812 --> 01:11:21,514
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, the more use of it, the more practical and that's what it's there for.

706
01:11:21,554 --> 01:11:22,694
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're open to that.

707
01:11:23,617 --> 01:11:32,485
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do, I have personal experience with knowing of people who have charging stations at work and therefore purchase an electric vehicle.

708
01:11:33,226 --> 01:11:35,368
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do know that that concept works.

709
01:11:39,111 --> 01:11:43,054
[SPEAKER_10]: So how many EV stations are being planned?

710
01:11:45,757 --> 01:11:46,617
[SPEAKER_16]: Two currently, right?

711
01:11:48,319 --> 01:11:49,099
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that's correct.

712
01:11:49,139 --> 01:11:49,620
[SPEAKER_19]: Two right now.

713
01:11:52,150 --> 01:11:54,711
[SPEAKER_19]: And there's some potential for increasing that.

714
01:11:54,751 --> 01:11:54,931
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

715
01:11:54,951 --> 01:12:00,974
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the challenge is we are, it is still a tight site and you know, you do need that infrastructure.

716
01:12:01,494 --> 01:12:08,497
[SPEAKER_19]: So, um, trying not to impact the parking count, uh, becomes a challenge and then also not taking away some of the landscaping that we put back in here.

717
01:12:08,517 --> 01:12:14,459
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, but yeah, there's, there's potential opportunities for some additional spots for, um, EV charging stations.

718
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:20,762
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't believe that making them EV takes away from their count in terms of zoning for parking.

719
01:12:21,597 --> 01:12:36,626
[SPEAKER_02]: We're exploring in some of our public lots having multiple chargers where maybe two spots say EV only and other spots that are served or servable by the EV charging is not restricted to EV only.

720
01:12:37,106 --> 01:12:43,530
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to have that flexibility, do you have two staff with electric vehicles or do you have four staff?

721
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:48,313
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you only have two, then the other spots can be used by other vehicles.

722
01:12:49,313 --> 01:12:52,896
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's something that we're actually looking at doing in some of our public lots.

723
01:12:53,716 --> 01:12:56,178
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's not necessarily the count that I'm concerned about.

724
01:12:56,878 --> 01:13:05,644
[SPEAKER_19]: We don't have a lot of areas where I can actually put the charging station itself, so it could have to go into the parking area, which then would take away potential parking spaces.

725
01:13:05,764 --> 01:13:18,272
[SPEAKER_19]: But yeah, there would be preference for EV, but typically, if nobody has an electric car, then the space could potentially be parked in otherwise.

726
01:13:19,512 --> 01:13:27,156
[SPEAKER_16]: And I just say that the tenant's gonna drive and we're gonna work with them to drive when we do secure a tenant, they're gonna wanna do these things as well.

727
01:13:27,256 --> 01:13:34,420
[SPEAKER_16]: So hopefully we're bringing on a tenant early in this process while we're still working on all of our design to incorporate that.

728
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:45,706
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's something we will push as well, but we wanted to show the commitment and the response to Todd's comments and the team to make sure that we are addressing at minimum what we should be addressing, but we'll be pushing for more.

729
01:13:49,927 --> 01:13:55,069
[SPEAKER_10]: just director Han, while we have used, I believe this, this building is also subject to the solar ordinance.

730
01:13:55,509 --> 01:14:03,311
[SPEAKER_10]: And, um, is there their plans to kind of install the solar, uh, right at the beginning?

731
01:14:07,692 --> 01:14:15,975
[SPEAKER_16]: So just, just a quick answer on that for my part, if you were asking me, sorry, but, um, so the one thing we had talked about in the beginning is that we need to confirm, we don't want to,

732
01:14:16,728 --> 01:14:22,032
[SPEAKER_16]: With solar, there's a lot of lease and requirements to keep their space, like you don't want to ever move them, right?

733
01:14:22,132 --> 01:14:27,776
[SPEAKER_16]: And so we want to confirm with the tenant that they're not putting certain equipment up there so then we can decide where to place it.

734
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:42,628
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think it's what we had talked about the beginning of what we had hoped would be possible is, you know, we go through this process as a core and shell, but when the tenant comes in with us, we address all those items because then we'll know exactly where we have space for it, which I think will be abundant.

735
01:14:42,868 --> 01:14:43,028
[SPEAKER_16]: But

736
01:14:43,657 --> 01:14:45,057
[SPEAKER_16]: I would hate to put solar in.

737
01:14:45,077 --> 01:14:48,119
[SPEAKER_16]: We've actually, we purchased a building in the seaport.

738
01:14:48,699 --> 01:14:53,300
[SPEAKER_16]: They had an abundance of solar and they wanted to convert to life science and they thought they had done it right.

739
01:14:53,340 --> 01:14:55,921
[SPEAKER_16]: We needed to add a bunch of dunnage and chillers and all this stuff.

740
01:14:55,941 --> 01:14:57,242
[SPEAKER_16]: This is different than this type of building.

741
01:14:57,562 --> 01:15:09,846
[SPEAKER_16]: But my only point is that it was a nightmare trying to reduce the amount of solar and get the same type of power out of it by having these units to take away from the sunlight and the glare and all that stuff.

742
01:15:10,725 --> 01:15:15,047
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to avoid that by being a little more thoughtful, and we just can't do that without the tenant at this point.

743
01:15:15,107 --> 01:15:18,548
[SPEAKER_16]: So I just, we are committed to it, and I don't want you to think that's an empty promise.

744
01:15:18,608 --> 01:15:20,048
[SPEAKER_16]: It's definitely a promise.

745
01:15:21,349 --> 01:15:25,470
[SPEAKER_16]: You're recording this meeting, so you can go back to these minutes at some point.

746
01:15:25,910 --> 01:15:29,332
[SPEAKER_16]: But I just can't answer that in a way that would be smart at this point.

747
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:37,995
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, I don't believe we have to see where they're gonna go, but there is an ordinance that's gonna need to be followed, which is, I believe, 25% of the,

748
01:15:40,532 --> 01:15:40,753
[SPEAKER_10]: roof.

749
01:15:40,813 --> 01:15:42,480
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that correct, Director Hunt?

750
01:15:44,492 --> 01:15:45,052
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's 50%.

751
01:15:45,312 --> 01:15:54,034
[SPEAKER_02]: The early requirement is to do a solar assessment.

752
01:15:54,554 --> 01:16:05,936
[SPEAKER_02]: But part of that is knowing where the equipment is going to go, what roof space is required for equipment, but then doing the solar assessment and letting us know what you can do.

753
01:16:06,676 --> 01:16:08,616
[SPEAKER_02]: And then moving forward with that.

754
01:16:08,956 --> 01:16:13,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully you can get a tenant committed before we get too far down this process.

755
01:16:14,458 --> 01:16:16,739
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we're committed to doing all this, the assessment and everything.

756
01:16:16,759 --> 01:16:17,860
[SPEAKER_16]: We just want to make sure it's smart.

757
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:20,862
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, and I don't want to say that this is the tenant's problem.

758
01:16:20,902 --> 01:16:22,303
[SPEAKER_16]: It's not, it's, it's ours, right?

759
01:16:22,423 --> 01:16:24,244
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just, we don't know it until the tenant comes there.

760
01:16:24,284 --> 01:16:32,048
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's helpful having an owner who's understanding and on board as opposed to a tenant who wants to do it.

761
01:16:32,108 --> 01:16:37,551
[SPEAKER_02]: And the owner that is not interested.

762
01:16:38,512 --> 01:16:43,175
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a few questions, but I'm going to open it up to the board members so that they can, they can get their questions first.

763
01:16:43,215 --> 01:16:43,355
[SPEAKER_10]: So,

764
01:16:45,602 --> 01:16:49,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Board members, anyone want to jump in?

765
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:52,707
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, David Blumberg.

766
01:16:53,827 --> 01:16:54,308
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure, Andre.

767
01:16:54,328 --> 01:16:54,708
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

768
01:16:56,269 --> 01:16:59,251
[SPEAKER_20]: In the materials, there are mentions of the proposed greenway.

769
01:16:59,291 --> 01:17:03,353
[SPEAKER_20]: Could Alicia, maybe someone just give us a little background?

770
01:17:03,413 --> 01:17:13,039
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, I just didn't see from the terrain the possibility of this linking up with much of anything, but maybe you can educate me or someone can educate me on the background with the

771
01:17:13,372 --> 01:17:15,193
[SPEAKER_20]: with the property and the proposed greenway?

772
01:17:16,615 --> 01:17:18,916
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a vision.

773
01:17:19,017 --> 01:17:27,764
[SPEAKER_02]: So the end of that rail line, that spur that's behind them, that actually is an old rail line that continues to go.

774
01:17:28,524 --> 01:17:32,828
[SPEAKER_02]: And the line itself is still, the space is still physically clear.

775
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:41,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Around the Bush property, under Route 28, next to BJ's,

776
01:17:43,009 --> 01:17:48,231
[SPEAKER_02]: And the property owner, so it's not immediate to BJ's, there's water next to BJ's, as you're all well aware.

777
01:17:48,591 --> 01:17:50,712
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the other side of that is the rail line.

778
01:17:51,272 --> 01:18:02,457
[SPEAKER_02]: And the property owner there is actually building new multifamily housing, is also very interested in there being a greenway along his property.

779
01:18:02,517 --> 01:18:04,978
[SPEAKER_02]: So he has left space for that in his plan.

780
01:18:05,998 --> 01:18:08,739
[SPEAKER_02]: And it then continues actually to cross Route 28.

781
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:18,663
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's an existing rail spur there that I actually walked a couple of times that then comes to the orange line.

782
01:18:19,263 --> 01:18:33,228
[SPEAKER_02]: And we thought that it was was actually quite excellent because it crossed the orange line at a land bridge that was had no rail use on top of it when we started exploring this up four years ago, and then one of the

783
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:43,799
[SPEAKER_02]: rail companies started running a line on the land bridge, but there's a lot of interest in exploring what can be done there.

784
01:18:43,819 --> 01:18:53,343
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes then across to River's Edge, where the property owner, John Priato, he actually walked this spur with me many years ago.

785
01:18:53,917 --> 01:19:01,203
[SPEAKER_02]: to look at whether we could use it to open up the East Medford neighborhood to connect to the Malden River by his properties.

786
01:19:01,743 --> 01:19:03,365
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's one end of it.

787
01:19:03,625 --> 01:19:11,431
[SPEAKER_02]: And behind this building is the other end of an existing, mostly abandoned rail spur.

788
01:19:12,832 --> 01:19:13,673
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, that's interesting.

789
01:19:13,733 --> 01:19:19,878
[SPEAKER_20]: It just looked like from the terrain that where it's close to this building, it was just sort of dead end there without an access to,

790
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:24,222
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the dead end behind this building.

791
01:19:24,342 --> 01:19:27,725
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the other direction where there's a lot of vision.

792
01:19:29,026 --> 01:19:29,306
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

793
01:19:29,326 --> 01:19:29,646
[SPEAKER_20]: Got it.

794
01:19:29,966 --> 01:19:30,187
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

795
01:19:30,207 --> 01:19:31,047
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for the background.

796
01:19:31,067 --> 01:19:31,768
[SPEAKER_20]: I appreciate that.

797
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:39,793
[SPEAKER_20]: The signage is our site plan review.

798
01:19:40,494 --> 01:19:47,919
[SPEAKER_20]: Should it include a view of the proposed signage for the building or is that subject to separate city approval?

799
01:19:51,607 --> 01:20:00,635
[SPEAKER_02]: that goes to the city council, I believe, but maybe there's a certain amount of zoning that's allowed as of essentially as of right.

800
01:20:00,655 --> 01:20:07,262
[SPEAKER_02]: If it, if they do signage that fits within our current zoning, then our office just signs off on it.

801
01:20:07,822 --> 01:20:13,147
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they want more signing that signage, then what's allowed by right, they have to go to city council.

802
01:20:14,237 --> 01:20:14,497
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

803
01:20:15,118 --> 01:20:15,378
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

804
01:20:16,559 --> 01:20:33,691
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to say just, I guess, generally my sense of the market for buildings like this these days is just so much demand right now for warehousing space, which I think would bring a lot of truck traffic, a lot of ins and outs to a warehouse.

805
01:20:33,791 --> 01:20:37,694
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think the city and the community would benefit.

806
01:20:39,149 --> 01:20:46,652
[SPEAKER_20]: in a great part by this sort of a reuse of this property as opposed to what I think would otherwise happen right now, given the market demands.

807
01:20:46,692 --> 01:20:56,476
[SPEAKER_20]: So I just wanted to share that if we have members of the community watching, I think they should feel better about this use than its current use or what the other alternatives might be.

808
01:20:57,617 --> 01:21:02,879
[SPEAKER_20]: I wondered if the tank pads, I mean, it's sort of, I guess,

809
01:21:04,498 --> 01:21:10,101
[SPEAKER_20]: Nothing you can really do about this as a design team, but it does seem like the back of the house is out front on this building.

810
01:21:10,181 --> 01:21:12,362
[SPEAKER_20]: You have the nice entrance sort of in the back.

811
01:21:13,662 --> 01:21:24,828
[SPEAKER_20]: Do we have an image that shows us the screening that was mentioned that would sort of block the tank area from the view of Sycamore Ave?

812
01:21:24,888 --> 01:21:31,551
[SPEAKER_20]: And then there was some graphics that were mentioned to soften the view, maybe block the view into the loading area as well.

813
01:21:32,677 --> 01:21:36,688
[SPEAKER_20]: I just didn't remember seeing a nice image on those two fronts.

814
01:21:42,437 --> 01:21:45,439
[SPEAKER_11]: We don't have a rendering that captures those views.

815
01:21:45,559 --> 01:21:53,183
[SPEAKER_11]: We share some precedence as to kind of what we're hoping to achieve and working through in terms of the feel of that screening.

816
01:21:53,823 --> 01:22:00,626
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's important to us, you said it well, that the back of house kind of comes to the front in some ways because it needs to.

817
01:22:00,646 --> 01:22:07,630
[SPEAKER_11]: So we feel very strongly about providing a nice screen edge there and having that be part of that entry sequence into the site.

818
01:22:08,850 --> 01:22:13,113
[SPEAKER_11]: but we don't have that designed to a detailed level yet.

819
01:22:13,133 --> 01:22:15,335
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's something we can certainly work with people on.

820
01:22:15,355 --> 01:22:16,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

821
01:22:17,976 --> 01:22:28,924
[SPEAKER_16]: David, just one of the things, we've been partners with SGA for a while, but one of the things that really had our teams come together a lot was what they did at the links in Watertown.

822
01:22:29,204 --> 01:22:34,147
[SPEAKER_16]: And I feel like they did a really good job of repurposing a building, if you ever have a chance to see it,

823
01:22:34,618 --> 01:22:37,801
[SPEAKER_16]: but really like there's generators across the street in the parking lot, right.

824
01:22:37,841 --> 01:22:45,527
[SPEAKER_16]: As you're coming in and that's screened by some nice, like, you know, higher end kind of wood, um, sliding and fencing and things like that.

825
01:22:45,567 --> 01:22:49,871
[SPEAKER_16]: They did a really good job of making it not feel like you're going through a tank farm or anything like that.

826
01:22:50,551 --> 01:22:53,614
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, and that's, that's one of the reasons we partnered with SGA.

827
01:22:53,634 --> 01:22:58,678
[SPEAKER_16]: Cause I think they get creative around those and it doesn't just look like, you know, some awful chain link fence in front of it.

828
01:22:58,738 --> 01:23:01,521
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really got some purpose behind it.

829
01:23:01,541 --> 01:23:03,162
[SPEAKER_16]: So hopefully it'll look nice when we're done with it.

830
01:23:04,969 --> 01:23:06,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, that sounds good.

831
01:23:06,691 --> 01:23:22,812
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just jump on that David just because you raised that issue and yeah that's a very big concern of mine is that sort of the southwestern corner which would be what the front of the building is as you're approaching it from the street and

832
01:23:23,973 --> 01:23:45,199
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would really like to see something done with that facade, either continuing the, you know, the window treatments, even if they're false windows, or potentially using those huge walls for some kind of, you know, mural or, you know, public art.

833
01:23:47,079 --> 01:23:47,800
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that would be

834
01:23:49,722 --> 01:23:50,743
[SPEAKER_10]: a great opportunity.

835
01:23:50,783 --> 01:23:54,366
[SPEAKER_10]: Otherwise, just leaving it the way that it is, I think, would be unfortunate.

836
01:24:00,450 --> 01:24:03,793
[SPEAKER_16]: So we'd put anything on the side of the building if cities would let us.

837
01:24:03,853 --> 01:24:06,035
[SPEAKER_16]: Typically, we're not asked to do that.

838
01:24:06,115 --> 01:24:09,978
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm sure John and his team could come up with something creative there.

839
01:24:10,018 --> 01:24:16,983
[SPEAKER_16]: We were trying to put a lot of focus on the areas we could control, which is really making that entry so important.

840
01:24:17,544 --> 01:24:17,864
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think

841
01:24:18,423 --> 01:24:23,686
[SPEAKER_16]: John and his team are very focused on trying to make that a better experience as you're coming up Sycamore.

842
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:31,611
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's not, you know, we're trying to solve for a better building within the community, but we're also trying to solve for selling this to a tenant to make them attractive to come here.

843
01:24:31,631 --> 01:24:34,673
[SPEAKER_16]: And they don't want to be going by a tank farm that they create every day either.

844
01:24:34,733 --> 01:24:36,654
[SPEAKER_16]: So we need to make that look a little better.

845
01:24:36,714 --> 01:24:37,955
[SPEAKER_16]: We can spend some time on that.

846
01:24:39,165 --> 01:24:53,051
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I think one of the, you know, a couple of things we're trying to balance, but to Matt's point where, you know, we really want this building to have a nice, pleasant experience for people, you know, that are approaching it and appealing for tenants to make it, you know, successful.

847
01:24:54,451 --> 01:25:04,275
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think, you know, we felt like we could clean it up and keep it somewhat neutral for tenants until we know who that tenant is and maybe what their branding looks like and, you know, how that may start to work with it.

848
01:25:05,736 --> 01:25:14,084
[SPEAKER_11]: The screening, you know, kind of back to the screening elements, I think that those are wonderful opportunities for public art or something kind of fun and sculptural and something that kind of ties into the building.

849
01:25:14,124 --> 01:25:25,555
[SPEAKER_11]: So we certainly, we want to reduce the view of some of the equipment, but we certainly see those as opportunities to make it a better building and a better project and incorporate something fun and, you know, specific to the site.

850
01:25:25,635 --> 01:25:28,758
[SPEAKER_11]: So very much appreciate the comments.

851
01:25:31,067 --> 01:25:37,962
[SPEAKER_10]: John, what did you think about the idea of kind of like continuing in some way the window treatments, even if they're not actually windows?

852
01:25:39,973 --> 01:25:42,634
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there may be, I mean, we need to look at it with the group.

853
01:25:42,674 --> 01:25:43,975
[SPEAKER_11]: I think there may be an opportunity.

854
01:25:44,015 --> 01:25:57,140
[SPEAKER_11]: We've used those vertical elements to organize the windows, and maybe some of those vertical elements could find their way towards the front of the building and, you know, kind of speak to that rhythm and provide a little bit of continuity as you turn the corner.

855
01:25:58,301 --> 01:26:06,764
[SPEAKER_11]: Or maybe we carry some material a little bit further around the corner that we're starting, you know, to use for cladding on the side we're providing the new facade.

856
01:26:06,784 --> 01:26:07,965
[SPEAKER_11]: So I do think there's some,

857
01:26:09,085 --> 01:26:09,866
[SPEAKER_11]: opportunity there.

858
01:26:10,747 --> 01:26:14,951
[SPEAKER_11]: That said, it's a really long facade, and it does step back a little bit.

859
01:26:14,971 --> 01:26:20,516
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think we'd want to be smart about making those interventions where they kind of help the most in terms of what you'd see.

860
01:26:20,536 --> 01:26:31,046
[SPEAKER_11]: And it may be some interventions that kind of lead you to where you actually physically enter the site, and that's where there's more expression.

861
01:26:31,546 --> 01:26:34,089
[SPEAKER_11]: But I definitely think there's some opportunity there.

862
01:26:35,727 --> 01:26:51,351
[SPEAKER_10]: just struggling a little bit with how we can, you know, condition the project to ensure that we get the, you know, the quality site design that we want, you know, while maintaining the flexibility that you're looking for, um, since you don't have a tenant yet.

863
01:26:51,571 --> 01:26:53,831
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's just, just going through my mind right now.

864
01:26:55,632 --> 01:26:56,772
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, absolutely.

865
01:26:56,812 --> 01:27:02,994
[SPEAKER_11]: And I mean, I know Matt feels this way too, but we're, you know, we're committed to making this a great building.

866
01:27:03,014 --> 01:27:03,054
[SPEAKER_11]: Um,

867
01:27:04,729 --> 01:27:07,094
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're open to exploring those ideas.

868
01:27:10,262 --> 01:27:12,908
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there other board members who want to jump in?

869
01:27:13,910 --> 01:27:14,812
[SPEAKER_10]: Christy or Deanna?

870
01:27:15,347 --> 01:27:15,787
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, go ahead.

871
01:27:15,807 --> 01:27:17,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, I did interrupt you.

872
01:27:17,128 --> 01:27:17,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, David.

873
01:27:17,788 --> 01:27:18,008
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

874
01:27:18,208 --> 01:27:20,369
[SPEAKER_20]: I just said a few more if it's okay.

875
01:27:21,950 --> 01:27:32,514
[SPEAKER_20]: And that is, I was a little surprised only a couple of spots, but I think my guess is that the type of tenant you're looking to attract to this building is probably going to ask much more of you on that front.

876
01:27:33,554 --> 01:27:35,535
[SPEAKER_20]: And there's probably a lot of

877
01:27:36,613 --> 01:27:47,217
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, some comfort that we should get from thinking through that next tenant will be at this building because they're gonna be, I think, aware of the sort of the back of the house issues that we're talking about right now.

878
01:27:48,238 --> 01:27:52,840
[SPEAKER_20]: The parking itself and the number of spaces, is it being driven by zoning?

879
01:27:52,920 --> 01:27:59,103
[SPEAKER_20]: Is it being driven by your sense of what the market is looking for in terms of satisfying the employee counts?

880
01:28:01,884 --> 01:28:02,384
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe it's both.

881
01:28:06,367 --> 01:28:14,714
[SPEAKER_15]: It is both, but I don't know if Ken or, who wants to talk to that one?

882
01:28:14,774 --> 01:28:33,329
[SPEAKER_19]: I mean, obviously, yes, zoning is driving this a little bit, but I think as we talk about the potential number of employees here, we could handle around 200, that would put us at the 100 spaces that would be needed just to handle the employees here.

883
01:28:34,090 --> 01:28:35,311
[SPEAKER_19]: So I think it's,

884
01:28:36,698 --> 01:28:38,959
[SPEAKER_19]: you know, I think it's yes, zoning, but it's also market driven.

885
01:28:39,880 --> 01:28:42,541
[SPEAKER_19]: And they seem to be aligning on this site.

886
01:28:42,581 --> 01:28:54,248
[SPEAKER_16]: So yeah, I'll just compliment that with the fact that, you know, we have, you know, we've loosely marketed this and, and the first question, surprisingly, I thought it would be ceiling height and things like that.

887
01:28:54,288 --> 01:28:56,469
[SPEAKER_16]: First question, how many parking spots do you get to have?

888
01:28:56,489 --> 01:28:58,971
[SPEAKER_16]: Because they can't see the parking right when we walk up there.

889
01:28:58,991 --> 01:29:00,672
[SPEAKER_16]: And, and they're kind of

890
01:29:01,532 --> 01:29:05,273
[SPEAKER_16]: pushing us, there's been a few that have pushed us to say, well, 100 is not enough.

891
01:29:05,473 --> 01:29:07,854
[SPEAKER_16]: And we're like, well, there's no real valid reason to go beyond that.

892
01:29:07,894 --> 01:29:15,556
[SPEAKER_16]: So we have properties in Framingham that are GNP facilities, and they're at this ratio currently, and it seems to work pretty well.

893
01:29:15,777 --> 01:29:20,058
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think we just kind of fell into it by both of those kind of converging at that 100.

894
01:29:20,518 --> 01:29:23,559
[SPEAKER_16]: But it is something that's very important to them.

895
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:26,400
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm not

896
01:29:26,682 --> 01:29:28,063
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I actually had that question.

897
01:29:28,083 --> 01:29:28,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Same question.

898
01:29:29,143 --> 01:29:33,546
[SPEAKER_10]: If you, even if you have 200 employees, I mean, how many are actually on site at any one time?

899
01:29:33,986 --> 01:29:34,246
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

900
01:29:34,306 --> 01:29:37,208
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, they, they actually use this if you can believe it.

901
01:29:37,408 --> 01:29:43,011
[SPEAKER_16]: So for their investors and think they like to have in tours come in because they want to continue to raise funding.

902
01:29:43,031 --> 01:29:47,994
[SPEAKER_16]: Like they use this as like a chance to showcase kind of their, what they're capable of at some point.

903
01:29:48,054 --> 01:29:52,056
[SPEAKER_16]: So they have the workers that are there, but they also like to have some spots where people can come in.

904
01:29:52,096 --> 01:29:52,276
[SPEAKER_16]: So it,

905
01:29:53,979 --> 01:29:57,400
[SPEAKER_16]: there is no great answer other than the fact that everybody's looking for more than this.

906
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:01,980
[SPEAKER_16]: And we, we derive to the fact that, all right, let's find out how many people actually working here.

907
01:30:02,000 --> 01:30:02,160
[SPEAKER_16]: That's 200.

908
01:30:02,201 --> 01:30:06,641
[SPEAKER_16]: That's at 50% living on, you know, 0.5 per person.

909
01:30:06,681 --> 01:30:13,383
[SPEAKER_16]: And we came to a hundred and it, you know, we were quite honestly, we were pushing pretty hard to get to the a hundred because we were at like 85 to 86.

910
01:30:13,463 --> 01:30:17,603
[SPEAKER_16]: When we originally looked at this, we had to really tighten it up to make it proper.

911
01:30:17,623 --> 01:30:21,304
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um, I don't know this we've,

912
01:30:22,225 --> 01:30:24,006
[SPEAKER_16]: we're getting pushed out and framing it as well.

913
01:30:24,026 --> 01:30:29,871
[SPEAKER_16]: They're asking us to build a new building and they're really pushing us to do above ground infrastructure parking, which is not preferred up there.

914
01:30:30,531 --> 01:30:33,513
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, but they really wish they really are pushing the parking and they are using it.

915
01:30:33,533 --> 01:30:37,996
[SPEAKER_16]: I will say it's full even during these COVID times, it is full the parking lot.

916
01:30:39,698 --> 01:30:43,040
[SPEAKER_10]: We tend to be a board that is, uh, pushes down on parking.

917
01:30:44,061 --> 01:30:46,783
[SPEAKER_09]: I was also wondering the same thing, like, uh,

918
01:30:47,455 --> 01:30:57,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Would it be expected that all 200 employees would be like working during the day or is it expected that this would be like a, you know, where there would be night shifts and that people would be there at night?

919
01:30:59,542 --> 01:31:00,863
[SPEAKER_16]: It's predominantly day.

920
01:31:00,883 --> 01:31:02,644
[SPEAKER_16]: I think the traffic counts show that, right?

921
01:31:02,664 --> 01:31:10,308
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, I wasn't asking you, just on our team, but it's predominantly day traffic and day usage.

922
01:31:12,570 --> 01:31:14,791
[SPEAKER_09]: I was wondering if we have any like other

923
01:31:15,919 --> 01:31:18,502
[SPEAKER_09]: buildings that are similar size in the area.

924
01:31:18,642 --> 01:31:30,195
[SPEAKER_09]: And if we know what their like parking ratio, how many employees drive to work versus take the, I don't know, Todd, if you have any sense of that.

925
01:31:33,292 --> 01:31:38,717
[SPEAKER_01]: And not of this particular type of use, I would rely on the proponent to come up with comps for that.

926
01:31:38,837 --> 01:31:40,178
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a great question.

927
01:31:40,939 --> 01:31:42,380
[SPEAKER_01]: I had that initial question as well.

928
01:31:42,440 --> 01:31:45,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there a number of shifts or is it just one shift?

929
01:31:45,864 --> 01:31:48,486
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if it's not a number of shifts, what are the ratios?

930
01:31:48,506 --> 01:31:53,831
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ratios in Medford, there's some data, census data that show ratios in Medford.

931
01:31:53,871 --> 01:31:57,874
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the other things that that's why we're pushing, as you know, pushing

932
01:31:59,293 --> 01:32:07,895
[SPEAKER_01]: developers and proponents to advocate for other alternative modes so that we're not just, you know, one could argue that Medford's not the same as Framingham, right?

933
01:32:07,955 --> 01:32:09,776
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little closer to Boston.

934
01:32:09,816 --> 01:32:11,656
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a few more options.

935
01:32:11,676 --> 01:32:18,038
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully, but that was, that stood out to me as well, but based on what they provided, it seemed like.

936
01:32:19,198 --> 01:32:19,418
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

937
01:32:19,558 --> 01:32:26,160
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully that works, but it might be useful to identify like shared parking opportunities in the area.

938
01:32:26,220 --> 01:32:26,740
[SPEAKER_09]: If, if

939
01:32:27,879 --> 01:32:32,021
[SPEAKER_09]: there is more of a demand than the number of spaces.

940
01:32:34,902 --> 01:32:48,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was thinking particularly along the northern edge of the parking lot where you have faces onto the other parking lot and the other industrial property.

941
01:32:49,188 --> 01:32:56,131
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not very attractive, so I wanted to get a little bit more clarity about what you're planning for screening there and

942
01:32:57,059 --> 01:33:05,543
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, hey, I wouldn't mind taking, you know, five of the spaces and turning them into like tree islands so you could get more trees on that edge.

943
01:33:11,045 --> 01:33:12,766
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I had one additional question.

944
01:33:12,786 --> 01:33:18,388
[SPEAKER_09]: There's like a hatched area in the parking lot, I think on the northern edge.

945
01:33:18,428 --> 01:33:19,548
[SPEAKER_09]: I was wondering what that was.

946
01:33:19,568 --> 01:33:23,150
[SPEAKER_19]: It's for fire department access.

947
01:33:24,613 --> 01:33:29,217
[SPEAKER_19]: So the fire department wants people to come into the site and maneuver without having to stop or back up.

948
01:33:29,977 --> 01:33:34,701
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's a very tight, you know, from where the building is to the property line, it's very tight.

949
01:33:35,242 --> 01:33:41,567
[SPEAKER_19]: And so very large ladder truck or tower, you know, aerial tower comes in.

950
01:33:41,687 --> 01:33:47,932
[SPEAKER_19]: It needs all of that room to maneuver, and the fire department requested that we make it so that the truck can maneuver through the site.

951
01:33:48,312 --> 01:33:52,055
[SPEAKER_19]: Victor was at the meeting, and they were pretty adamant.

952
01:33:52,828 --> 01:33:55,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Should that be labeled like fire lane or?

953
01:33:56,230 --> 01:33:58,132
[SPEAKER_19]: We could call that fire lane no parking.

954
01:34:02,775 --> 01:34:13,482
[SPEAKER_16]: One of the things just important to note to your point, Andre, is that existing right now is some pretty bad delineation between the two property lines.

955
01:34:13,562 --> 01:34:16,024
[SPEAKER_16]: It's like bent up guardrail.

956
01:34:16,084 --> 01:34:17,004
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm just looking at it right now.

957
01:34:18,225 --> 01:34:20,387
[SPEAKER_16]: Chain link fence that's completely dilapidated.

958
01:34:20,427 --> 01:34:22,188
[SPEAKER_16]: We're actually raising the land by like,

959
01:34:23,163 --> 01:34:24,084
[SPEAKER_16]: I forget how many feet it is.

960
01:34:25,925 --> 01:34:29,508
[SPEAKER_16]: Campbell, we're bringing it up to that entrance because the slab is actually elevated.

961
01:34:30,049 --> 01:34:35,053
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're bringing it up and we're gonna create a condition that is definitely more favorable along that line.

962
01:34:36,074 --> 01:34:48,123
[SPEAKER_16]: But again, I don't know what we do there, like in terms of like going beyond that, some kind of, you know, sophisticated better fencing system.

963
01:34:48,163 --> 01:34:52,527
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what the other, like I'm just trying to figure out what are we solving for there?

964
01:34:53,487 --> 01:34:59,572
[SPEAKER_16]: Is it more the view of people from our parking lot looking at their building parking lot, or is it the other way?

965
01:34:59,592 --> 01:35:13,845
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I'd be, from my perspective, in terms of putting more vegetation in, it'd be, you know, reducing the asphalt heat island effect, getting, you know, more permeability.

966
01:35:13,865 --> 01:35:19,870
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, so you're thinking more like if there was a line of vegetation along that, I'm sorry, I just misunderstood that.

967
01:35:20,929 --> 01:35:26,011
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I was thinking, I mean, ideally, and I understand this is not kind of where you're going with it.

968
01:35:26,352 --> 01:35:42,559
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I would love to take, you know, several of those parking spots, you know, every few parking spots and turn it into a tree Island so that you can get a lot more, uh, you know, green cover of the, of the parking lot.

969
01:35:42,579 --> 01:35:46,841
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think it'd also be a lot more attractive for the parking lot as well, but

970
01:35:48,486 --> 01:35:55,112
[SPEAKER_10]: I think what you've been saying is that you're hearing that there are people pushing to have more than 100 spots.

971
01:35:57,034 --> 01:36:01,238
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we recently had somebody from Bedford come to us and ask for significantly more.

972
01:36:01,459 --> 01:36:03,060
[SPEAKER_16]: We may have been disqualified because of it.

973
01:36:06,540 --> 01:36:35,194
[SPEAKER_16]: it's uh we're trying to push the story as well like you know when you talk about um you know Todd made the recommendations like covered bike park and things like that those are things we intend to do anyways but we're trying to push that sustainability item um we can only push so far i guess is my only thing i would say and we are going to continue to push hard but again how do we assure you of that um how do you write a condition to make us assure that i'm not sure i just we want to say we're responsible but we also want to

974
01:36:35,942 --> 01:36:37,784
[SPEAKER_16]: we do wanna be able to lease this at some point too.

975
01:36:37,804 --> 01:36:42,570
[SPEAKER_10]: Todd Blake, I see that you have, oops, sorry, Ken.

976
01:36:42,771 --> 01:36:44,413
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's take Todd and then go back to you.

977
01:36:45,088 --> 01:36:55,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was going to respond to something Andre said, but quickly, Matt, something you could do to promote bicycle usage is also have shower type facilities inside the building.

978
01:36:55,633 --> 01:37:05,318
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if you would have that anyways for this type of use, but by having that, sometimes that encourages cycling, especially for people with a long cycling commute.

979
01:37:06,618 --> 01:37:12,601
[SPEAKER_01]: But to get back to Andre's point about the parking and adding some green space, there may be an opportunity I see on the plan

980
01:37:14,262 --> 01:37:20,684
[SPEAKER_01]: So the proponent does show 19 foot spaces in three of the four aisles and 17 in another.

981
01:37:21,104 --> 01:37:25,625
[SPEAKER_01]: So 17 is compact and 19 does meet our zoning code.

982
01:37:26,165 --> 01:37:31,526
[SPEAKER_01]: But my experience in other parking lots, you could make the 19, 18 and it would still work.

983
01:37:31,666 --> 01:37:43,769
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you did that at all three aisles, you'd gain three feet of, you know, I know it's not much Andre, but three feet of landscaping capability, either down along the whole length, along the middle or along that left edge there.

984
01:37:47,012 --> 01:37:48,613
[SPEAKER_19]: And that's something that we've talked about.

985
01:37:48,633 --> 01:37:50,675
[SPEAKER_19]: I think we would need to look at that.

986
01:37:51,115 --> 01:37:54,898
[SPEAKER_19]: I think the challenge still is the fire truck maneuvering through the site.

987
01:37:54,918 --> 01:37:58,481
[SPEAKER_19]: So even if I shrunk those parking spaces up, it kind of impacts it.

988
01:37:58,501 --> 01:37:59,402
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's something we looked at.

989
01:37:59,422 --> 01:38:12,013
[SPEAKER_19]: The thing that I was going to say is, you know, we made an effort to try to push the landscaping out towards Sycamore Avenue to create the entrance, you know, to create a better entrance, create a better feel along Sycamore Avenue.

990
01:38:12,888 --> 01:38:13,508
[SPEAKER_19]: for the site.

991
01:38:14,669 --> 01:38:20,632
[SPEAKER_19]: One option could be a little bit of a redistribution of like we have the larger landscape islands.

992
01:38:22,073 --> 01:38:25,255
[SPEAKER_19]: And I know Nicole's not going to be thrilled me, but we have the larger landscape island here.

993
01:38:25,275 --> 01:38:32,059
[SPEAKER_19]: At the entrance, we could put two parking spaces in there and maybe two

994
01:38:32,898 --> 01:38:39,343
[SPEAKER_19]: create an island of two spaces more centered on the, to help break up that a little bit more so you could put something more central.

995
01:38:39,363 --> 01:38:44,666
[SPEAKER_19]: So we're just, we're still getting the hundred spaces, but we're redistributing the landscaping through the parking lot a little bit better.

996
01:38:46,187 --> 01:39:02,159
[SPEAKER_16]: And I would just say on top of that, like where you're showing that, you know, the entry with the signage and the increased vegetation that currently, you know, two generators reside there and taking some of the comments, we decided let's move the generator, which is a substantial cost over to the,

997
01:39:02,791 --> 01:39:13,854
[SPEAKER_16]: the loading dock area because in both cases, just because we thought that we were trying to solve for as much, you know, we went from a building coverage to parking lot coverage, and we wanted to make as much vegetation as possible.

998
01:39:15,574 --> 01:39:18,275
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're open, obviously, to different suggestions.

999
01:39:18,355 --> 01:39:21,215
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, we were willing to put a significant cost to do that.

1000
01:39:21,255 --> 01:39:26,657
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just a matter of we want to try to solve for, I think, a lot of different aspects of what you're saying.

1001
01:39:26,677 --> 01:39:32,238
[SPEAKER_16]: Even just to your point, Todd, are you saying, if I'm looking at this plan, would it shrink from left to

1002
01:39:32,822 --> 01:39:37,818
[SPEAKER_16]: Would it shrink a little bit left and right, meaning the space's length will become shorter?

1003
01:39:39,741 --> 01:39:40,302
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that what you're saying?

1004
01:39:40,322 --> 01:39:41,102
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, that's what he's saying.

1005
01:39:41,202 --> 01:39:41,283
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1006
01:39:41,303 --> 01:39:41,943
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, correct.

1007
01:39:42,003 --> 01:39:48,450
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like you may be able to gain three feet, but I do understand there's still maneuverability up at the corner.

1008
01:39:48,610 --> 01:40:03,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you squeeze, basically shift the parking aisles in the central parking out to the right towards the building by three feet, you can then move the parking edge on the left by three feet and have a three foot buffer of landscape or in the middle, down the middle.

1009
01:40:05,017 --> 01:40:19,823
[SPEAKER_01]: But as others mentioned, if you shave off some on the entrance and put it somewhere in the middle, Alicia, please help me here, that may help with the heat zone of the parking lot by spreading the trees out slightly versus having a big swath of pavement in the middle as well.

1010
01:40:24,867 --> 01:40:43,592
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't hurt as long as the island was big enough for the trees were planted in a well to really support larger trees so like a small island if it was done as a tree well, so there was room under the parking lot for the roots to expand if water from the parking lot was allowed to go into the tree well.

1011
01:40:44,992 --> 01:40:47,553
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that Cambridge has been working with a lot.

1012
01:40:48,933 --> 01:40:57,755
[SPEAKER_02]: That could then support a larger tree, which would give you shade, as opposed to a tiny island with only a tiny bit of water that hits that tree.

1013
01:40:58,395 --> 01:40:59,875
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd have some shade problems.

1014
01:41:00,815 --> 01:41:04,016
[SPEAKER_02]: I would defer to an arborist as to whether or not you could make it work.

1015
01:41:11,406 --> 01:41:13,546
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it sounds like it's just shifting it around.

1016
01:41:13,566 --> 01:41:17,267
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm not saying that that's necessarily what we wanna do.

1017
01:41:17,587 --> 01:41:23,528
[SPEAKER_10]: I was trying to see if there's anything additive, particularly for large shade trees.

1018
01:41:25,169 --> 01:41:35,170
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm wondering if you could just talk a little bit again about the landscaper, if Nicole could speak a little bit more about where there will be kind of large trees.

1019
01:41:35,330 --> 01:41:37,971
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't really tell from this site plan here.

1020
01:41:39,874 --> 01:41:57,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, so right now we're looking at the main entry where the monument sign is for some larger trees, the tree wells in the parking lot, and then several spots around the page right area where we've got a little bit more distance with the building.

1021
01:41:58,341 --> 01:42:07,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, we'd need to be working with how the openings to the building are working so that we're not just blocking windows and views and light that are coming in.

1022
01:42:08,747 --> 01:42:16,611
[SPEAKER_03]: But those are the areas that we're looking at trying to bring in some of the larger trees and possibly in this tank farm area as well.

1023
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:28,178
[SPEAKER_03]: The other piece that we are aware of, just keeping in mind, is visibility for the loading dock and the entry and exits for the parking area.

1024
01:42:28,418 --> 01:42:35,142
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's something that we've been in discussion with on how do we make sure that we've got safety sightlines kept in mind with that as well.

1025
01:42:37,077 --> 01:42:59,523
[SPEAKER_03]: But as you know, as to what Alicia was saying about trying to bring in more permeability with larger trees in these medians, that is definitely something that we could look at and explore further with how to have more root expansion under this parking lot area and taking up some of the stormwater that happens in those areas.

1026
01:42:59,803 --> 01:43:02,064
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something that we've done quite a bit of.

1027
01:43:03,632 --> 01:43:07,336
[SPEAKER_10]: And is there, are you landscaping on the railroad spur?

1028
01:43:08,036 --> 01:43:13,161
[SPEAKER_10]: I know you're not moving the rails, but it looks like there's landscaping on the spur.

1029
01:43:13,641 --> 01:43:17,524
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really trees, you know, adding trees where we have space to add trees.

1030
01:43:17,605 --> 01:43:19,046
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not a lot of room.

1031
01:43:19,066 --> 01:43:27,193
[SPEAKER_03]: So in some areas that would be smaller trees or it'd really just be maintaining or adding to the turf grass that's back there because

1032
01:43:27,540 --> 01:43:39,285
[SPEAKER_03]: we're not anticipating a lot of activity back in this space, but it's really more to add in whatever ecosystem services we can where we've got the space.

1033
01:43:42,727 --> 01:43:45,388
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm still a little confused about the tank farm.

1034
01:43:45,448 --> 01:43:48,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Is the tank farm service from the inside or the outside?

1035
01:43:48,670 --> 01:43:50,090
[SPEAKER_10]: And how tall is it?

1036
01:43:50,130 --> 01:43:53,532
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't have, we didn't really see a rendering from that side.

1037
01:43:53,552 --> 01:43:55,273
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm confused about like how the,

1038
01:43:56,359 --> 01:44:02,101
[SPEAKER_10]: the signage and the concrete walkway and the plantings, how that's all working together.

1039
01:44:07,582 --> 01:44:11,823
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, Tom Joyner with AHA Consulting Engineers.

1040
01:44:12,403 --> 01:44:25,187
[SPEAKER_14]: So right now the tanks are being, we're planning three spots, and as Ken mentioned, typical gases that are needed for this type of operation are nitrogen, oxygen,

1041
01:44:26,825 --> 01:44:29,747
[SPEAKER_14]: and CO2, they can be of varying size.

1042
01:44:29,767 --> 01:44:36,512
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, there could be a facility that actually doesn't need any, that they work with indoor tanks.

1043
01:44:36,632 --> 01:44:49,742
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, these tanks could be of the size that are six foot diameter and 12 feet tall or higher, depending on what their bulk need is.

1044
01:44:50,743 --> 01:44:55,266
[SPEAKER_14]: But in general, that's, you know, order of magnitude of what we would see out there.

1045
01:44:57,140 --> 01:45:08,423
[SPEAKER_10]: So is this, again, another element that's going to depend on the tenant, and could potentially be no tank farm, or is there... What's going to be there?

1046
01:45:08,883 --> 01:45:17,046
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I mean, from a planning standpoint, what Oxford's doing is trying to anticipate what this type of manufacturing tenant would need.

1047
01:45:17,926 --> 01:45:24,328
[SPEAKER_14]: And so for space planning, it is location for bulk tank and for filling.

1048
01:45:25,247 --> 01:45:29,651
[SPEAKER_14]: So these things would be filled by tanker trucks that actually could park.

1049
01:45:30,953 --> 01:45:36,618
[SPEAKER_14]: In within the loading dock area and bring hoses over to the tanks to fill them.

1050
01:45:37,419 --> 01:45:45,767
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you would have piping in behind the tank that you know we've taken and comes into the building for for the process utility.

1051
01:45:52,766 --> 01:46:02,016
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that was one of my questions whether a tanker truck would have to like get right up there where the, you know, this site plan says there's going to be planting.

1052
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:12,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, they typically all come with with long hoses that can can fill from from a distance.

1053
01:46:14,042 --> 01:46:21,545
[SPEAKER_11]: And just to kind of give a little sense of scale, that's about a 15 foot depth of planting before you get to the screen from the back of the sidewalk.

1054
01:46:21,565 --> 01:46:26,846
[SPEAKER_11]: So it is a good opportunity for some decent size planting buffering.

1055
01:46:32,288 --> 01:46:42,752
[SPEAKER_10]: And John, I don't know if you're the one doing this, but what is the treatment right now for the edge of the parking lot on the,

1056
01:46:43,752 --> 01:46:44,332
[SPEAKER_10]: North side.

1057
01:46:49,995 --> 01:46:54,518
[SPEAKER_11]: Right here, this, and Nicole, you may be able to help also.

1058
01:46:55,018 --> 01:46:56,679
[SPEAKER_11]: This is, I mean, it is tight.

1059
01:46:56,719 --> 01:46:59,881
[SPEAKER_11]: We're kind of right up against the edge, and that's just meant to be kind of a fence condition.

1060
01:47:00,621 --> 01:47:01,222
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.

1061
01:47:01,682 --> 01:47:04,783
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think you could talk about different ways to treat that fence.

1062
01:47:05,944 --> 01:47:10,186
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we're going to want a nicer edge for that, you know, for that side of the site.

1063
01:47:10,306 --> 01:47:12,388
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's kind of what we have.

1064
01:47:13,401 --> 01:47:14,361
[SPEAKER_11]: space for in that end.

1065
01:47:15,441 --> 01:47:15,601
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1066
01:47:15,661 --> 01:47:26,664
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I guess I was just wondering whether you had something already planned there or if it was, you know, is it going to match some of the, like the nice cladding you had on the, on the rendering?

1067
01:47:26,684 --> 01:47:42,487
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what we have initially thrown out for some ideas is the corrugated aluminum fence that we had a precedent image of, but this is definitely something that we would want it to speak to the facade and the architecture and

1068
01:47:43,047 --> 01:47:49,611
[SPEAKER_03]: and definitely coordinate with how that's working as well as with the other screens.

1069
01:47:52,032 --> 01:48:03,339
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, and that's been the thought for some of these other screens that are kind of more to the front of the site is that this, particularly this one here near the loading and near the tank could be a similar material that we've started to use on the facade.

1070
01:48:03,359 --> 01:48:08,182
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's some connection to the building and then an opportunity to provide graphics or

1071
01:48:09,998 --> 01:48:12,600
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, color or some art as you had referenced before.

1072
01:48:12,620 --> 01:48:17,605
[SPEAKER_11]: But that was the thought that, you know, maybe this one in particular and this one start to speak to the building facade.

1073
01:48:17,625 --> 01:48:24,352
[SPEAKER_11]: So that gives you some of those continuous moments around the site as you work kind of deeper into the site towards the entry.

1074
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:30,392
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1075
01:48:31,072 --> 01:48:32,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, one more question.

1076
01:48:33,173 --> 01:48:38,734
[SPEAKER_10]: This is more about the probably a traffic question and great question.

1077
01:48:39,955 --> 01:48:41,595
[SPEAKER_10]: So with the loading dock area.

1078
01:48:41,915 --> 01:48:46,837
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I appreciate the fact that you've narrowed that opening to about 100 feet.

1079
01:48:49,723 --> 01:48:53,466
[SPEAKER_10]: You also mentioned that the parking area is actually going to be regraded.

1080
01:48:53,486 --> 01:48:56,508
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be a little higher than what it is right now, I think.

1081
01:48:57,089 --> 01:49:10,939
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess my question is, generally, when we review projects with this board, when there are driveways, we require the pedestrian crossing to be at grade.

1082
01:49:11,540 --> 01:49:15,463
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm wondering, here, it doesn't look like that's the case, because it's a six

1083
01:49:16,461 --> 01:49:18,282
[SPEAKER_10]: door loading dock, industrial area.

1084
01:49:18,583 --> 01:49:23,146
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm just wondering whether with some of the grade changes that would be possible to do that.

1085
01:49:26,989 --> 01:49:29,531
[SPEAKER_19]: So across the loading dock, there won't be any grade change.

1086
01:49:29,671 --> 01:49:36,676
[SPEAKER_19]: If anything, we've enhanced the pedestrian connection by creating the sidewalk that isn't there today and creating that opportunity.

1087
01:49:37,036 --> 01:49:41,860
[SPEAKER_19]: It will be at grade with the existing, with Sycamore Avenue and the loading area.

1088
01:49:42,999 --> 01:49:54,345
[SPEAKER_19]: As you enter into the site, we use more of a traditional driveway apron so that the sidewalk is sitting up and continuous across the driveway and you ramp up into the site.

1089
01:49:56,085 --> 01:49:58,767
[SPEAKER_19]: That was suggested by Todd.

1090
01:49:59,067 --> 01:50:01,048
[SPEAKER_19]: So we've incorporated that into the design.

1091
01:50:01,328 --> 01:50:04,730
[SPEAKER_19]: So it keeps a more continuous pedestrian connection through there.

1092
01:50:05,010 --> 01:50:10,852
[SPEAKER_19]: But the parking lot, we're matching into the grades at Sycamore Avenue.

1093
01:50:12,718 --> 01:50:22,762
[SPEAKER_19]: The parking lot is generally gonna be the same grade as the loading area, the existing loading area for the existing building.

1094
01:50:23,242 --> 01:50:24,463
[SPEAKER_19]: It'll be generally that same area.

1095
01:50:24,503 --> 01:50:39,309
[SPEAKER_19]: I think what we're talking about towards the back, we ramp up a little bit, but we still have a great difference between the parking and the finished floor elevation of the space where you have to get up that three and a half feet, and hence the stairs and ramp system at the entrance.

1096
01:50:54,012 --> 01:50:56,693
[SPEAKER_10]: Board members, do you have additional questions?

1097
01:50:56,713 --> 01:50:59,094
[SPEAKER_20]: I had a couple more, Andre.

1098
01:51:00,015 --> 01:51:00,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, David, go ahead.

1099
01:51:02,016 --> 01:51:23,305
[SPEAKER_20]: What I guess is sort of a comment to throw out there, maybe it's for Matt's consideration more than anyone else, but given the proximity to Wellington, it may be that that tenant that occupies the whole building would find it advantageous to have some sort of shuttle service that would be able to pick up employees who are coming out of the city on the Orange Line.

1100
01:51:23,999 --> 01:51:26,003
[SPEAKER_20]: to work in the mornings, evenings.

1101
01:51:26,704 --> 01:51:32,716
[SPEAKER_20]: I've seen that work in some other of our suburban office parks.

1102
01:51:33,738 --> 01:51:34,800
[SPEAKER_20]: So something to consider there.

1103
01:51:35,494 --> 01:51:36,454
[SPEAKER_16]: That's great, David.

1104
01:51:36,714 --> 01:51:40,175
[SPEAKER_16]: We bought property at 645 Summer in the seaport.

1105
01:51:41,095 --> 01:51:43,436
[SPEAKER_16]: We organize and manage a shuttle service.

1106
01:51:44,796 --> 01:51:52,998
[SPEAKER_16]: Inevitably, the tenant ends up paying through the operation costs, but it's something, again, that we like to connect people to transportation, right?

1107
01:51:53,018 --> 01:51:54,539
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we want to make sure that's easy for them.

1108
01:51:55,519 --> 01:51:57,479
[SPEAKER_16]: But I 100% agree.

1109
01:51:57,599 --> 01:52:01,860
[SPEAKER_16]: We did that about two years ago there, and it's been very successful so far.

1110
01:52:02,640 --> 01:52:03,021
[SPEAKER_16]: That's great.

1111
01:52:03,581 --> 01:52:03,781
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1112
01:52:04,001 --> 01:52:04,841
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for the suggestion.

1113
01:52:05,588 --> 01:52:05,848
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure.

1114
01:52:06,428 --> 01:52:32,493
[SPEAKER_20]: On the building entry, which I find quite attractive, I wonder, are there opportunities, I know it was mentioned that you're still considering the combination and exact pavers that might be used there, but for some more permeable surfaces, is there an opportunity for maybe some smaller ornamental trees there also to give a little green flavor to the entry?

1115
01:52:35,940 --> 01:52:36,781
[SPEAKER_16]: Let Nicole take that.

1116
01:52:36,801 --> 01:52:37,521
[SPEAKER_16]: She's the expert.

1117
01:52:37,981 --> 01:52:46,987
[SPEAKER_10]: We do have a question from an audience member on Zoom asking about permeable pavement for the parking area in general.

1118
01:52:53,371 --> 01:52:55,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think it's a great question.

1119
01:52:55,953 --> 01:52:58,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I think some of it comes down to

1120
01:53:01,267 --> 01:53:10,010
[SPEAKER_03]: like vehicular traffic on all the permeable pavers, it tends to be a little bit easier when you've got areas where it's more pedestrian traffic.

1121
01:53:11,911 --> 01:53:16,673
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's, I'm always a fan of permeable pavers if we can get them in there.

1122
01:53:16,693 --> 01:53:23,575
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's something that would be great for conversation, but definitely consider in pedestrian areas.

1123
01:53:26,376 --> 01:53:27,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I would say the same thing.

1124
01:53:28,617 --> 01:53:30,598
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a building in the back bay in Boston where we

1125
01:53:31,445 --> 01:53:32,666
[SPEAKER_16]: We had it over drive lanes.

1126
01:53:33,626 --> 01:53:35,347
[SPEAKER_16]: It goes around the entire perimeter of Back Bay.

1127
01:53:35,367 --> 01:53:37,048
[SPEAKER_16]: We did permeable pavers on the outside.

1128
01:53:38,028 --> 01:53:43,610
[SPEAKER_16]: The drive lanes haven't held up as well as we would hope, but the pedestrian portions of it have been very good.

1129
01:53:46,032 --> 01:53:48,113
[SPEAKER_16]: So we're open-minded to that.

1130
01:53:51,174 --> 01:53:59,698
[SPEAKER_10]: And the clarification from the audience member is that she was thinking of porous pavement.

1131
01:54:00,690 --> 01:54:02,171
[SPEAKER_10]: porous asphalt, not pavers.

1132
01:54:04,233 --> 01:54:20,546
[SPEAKER_02]: So something that I've seen in some places, actually, Lexington DPW's parking lot comes to mind, is that they use porous pavement and porous asphalt for the parking spots and regular asphalt for the drive lane.

1133
01:54:22,425 --> 01:54:26,767
[SPEAKER_02]: And that way to the untrained eye, it's just continuous asphalt.

1134
01:54:27,327 --> 01:54:40,934
[SPEAKER_02]: For somebody who's been given a green tour of their lot, you can actually see the difference in that way, because they spoke actually, because you're right, porous pavement does not hold up as well in the drive lanes.

1135
01:54:46,676 --> 01:54:48,197
[SPEAKER_16]: Well, I don't know what you've seen on that,

1136
01:54:48,780 --> 01:55:02,404
[SPEAKER_16]: We personally haven't done porous pavement in our parking lots and our facilities, but I'd have to look and see how they hold up, what's the maintenance, what's the, you know, how, what, you know, with snow removal, all that stuff.

1137
01:55:02,444 --> 01:55:06,885
[SPEAKER_16]: I just have to look at that to see if that's something that makes sense for the longevity of the project.

1138
01:55:08,686 --> 01:55:13,187
[SPEAKER_16]: But again, I mean, we're looking for better ways to do things every day if there's something

1139
01:55:14,727 --> 01:55:15,128
[SPEAKER_16]: It'd be great.

1140
01:55:15,148 --> 01:55:20,213
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, I think I just saw the note come across from stormwater management, which I think is a great point.

1141
01:55:20,234 --> 01:55:21,095
[SPEAKER_16]: We take it seriously.

1142
01:55:22,837 --> 01:55:25,880
[SPEAKER_16]: We can expand on what we're doing for stormwater if we need to.

1143
01:55:26,821 --> 01:55:35,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt, I'll add in, Copley Wolf has done some of this, like a project similar at UConn, if that's something that we want to

1144
01:55:35,708 --> 01:55:36,889
[SPEAKER_03]: discuss and put out there.

1145
01:55:37,189 --> 01:55:43,234
[SPEAKER_03]: And I imagine Ken has some more thoughts in terms of the infiltration rates that they've been calculating.

1146
01:55:43,254 --> 01:55:45,836
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I was going to jump in on that.

1147
01:55:45,896 --> 01:55:46,416
[SPEAKER_19]: So thanks.

1148
01:55:46,536 --> 01:55:47,297
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks, Nicole.

1149
01:55:47,677 --> 01:55:54,983
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I think that'll be the one big issue here is that the infiltration rates that we're preliminarily seeing out on the site aren't that great.

1150
01:55:55,023 --> 01:55:58,986
[SPEAKER_19]: So the benefit that we would have gotten from a porous pavement by letting it infiltrate into the ground

1151
01:55:59,660 --> 01:56:00,180
[SPEAKER_19]: isn't going to be there.

1152
01:56:00,200 --> 01:56:11,385
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to have to put based on what I'm seeing now, you know, we're probably we probably have to under drain the porous pavement so we can eliminate some of the frosty potential because the water is going to hold there.

1153
01:56:12,265 --> 01:56:18,067
[SPEAKER_19]: So we'll have to look at it a little bit more once we get some additional once we can take that building down and go out and do some additional testing.

1154
01:56:18,327 --> 01:56:20,868
[SPEAKER_19]: Hopefully we get better results than what we saw initially.

1155
01:56:20,888 --> 01:56:24,650
[SPEAKER_19]: And then go from there and look at what the opportunities may be.

1156
01:56:29,543 --> 01:56:30,825
[SPEAKER_10]: Do other board members have questions?

1157
01:56:31,065 --> 01:56:34,529
[SPEAKER_10]: David, do you still have a couple more?

1158
01:56:35,710 --> 01:56:46,643
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if anyone answered my sort of general comment about the building entry and maybe some additional landscaping or more greenery and less hard surfaces there as we enter the building.

1159
01:56:47,384 --> 01:56:49,787
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe the possibility of some trees there as well.

1160
01:56:51,390 --> 01:56:51,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1161
01:56:51,751 --> 01:56:56,736
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of what we're working with is the need to have space for our accessibility ramp.

1162
01:56:57,057 --> 01:57:05,366
[SPEAKER_03]: And so being able to have the width for the walls and the slope that we need to make that rise happen and fitting it into a pretty tight space.

1163
01:57:05,446 --> 01:57:11,694
[SPEAKER_03]: The major constraint we had was that with our traffic analysis and the need for fire access.

1164
01:57:12,415 --> 01:57:14,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, everything got pretty condensed.

1165
01:57:15,337 --> 01:57:18,779
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I, I will always put a tree in if I can.

1166
01:57:18,799 --> 01:57:24,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I need root ball space and I need accessibility space and I need fire truck space.

1167
01:57:24,363 --> 01:57:29,326
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a little bit, it's a little bit limited, um, up in that area.

1168
01:57:29,346 --> 01:57:32,148
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1169
01:57:32,168 --> 01:57:32,849
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you, Andrea.

1170
01:57:32,889 --> 01:57:33,969
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll pass the baton back.

1171
01:57:34,330 --> 01:57:34,690
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1172
01:57:36,031 --> 01:57:39,093
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, Blake, you have your hand raised.

1173
01:57:39,781 --> 01:57:44,752
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you Mister chair is just going to come into something you brought about the crosswalk across the loading base.

1174
01:57:45,314 --> 01:57:48,280
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was trying to look at the existing grades based on Street view and

1175
01:57:49,234 --> 01:58:18,032
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't appear that there's anything necessarily prohibiting them from necessarily proposing I think what you're suggesting Mister chair about sidewalk cement crossing versus painted crossing in other projects we usually Tim I usually suggest one or the other continue the sidewalk at the sidewalk grade and have a typical sidewalk driveway apron or if it's designed with pavement as more of a street opening to have a crosswalk

1176
01:58:18,816 --> 01:58:26,699
[SPEAKER_01]: So unless there's some grading issue that I'm not seeing, it doesn't seem like there's anything preventing them from doing what you're suggesting, if you prefer that.

1177
01:58:31,821 --> 01:58:32,141
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1178
01:58:34,562 --> 01:58:36,242
[SPEAKER_10]: Christy or Deanne?

1179
01:58:36,823 --> 01:58:37,583
[SPEAKER_12]: Tim, is that?

1180
01:58:38,943 --> 01:58:39,303
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I do.

1181
01:58:39,444 --> 01:58:39,864
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Andrea.

1182
01:58:39,904 --> 01:58:42,825
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to talk about the porous asphalt piece of it.

1183
01:58:44,193 --> 01:58:47,654
[SPEAKER_12]: As Ken mentioned, they're going to have to wait, see what they have in soil.

1184
01:58:47,935 --> 01:58:48,815
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm open to that.

1185
01:58:49,015 --> 01:58:56,558
[SPEAKER_12]: And as far as maintenance and things like that, I highly recommend the cured concrete porous product that's removable for cleaning up.

1186
01:58:57,739 --> 01:58:58,879
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are really nice.

1187
01:59:00,360 --> 01:59:07,482
[SPEAKER_12]: But of course, it's something that I'm willing to talk to you guys about if that's something you're interested in doing for stormwater for your site.

1188
01:59:07,522 --> 01:59:09,703
[SPEAKER_12]: So we want to make sure the soil is right.

1189
01:59:09,943 --> 01:59:10,924
[SPEAKER_12]: Ken's point is clear.

1190
01:59:18,052 --> 01:59:20,254
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Engineer McGovern.

1191
01:59:22,016 --> 01:59:23,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Christy or Deanna, any questions?

1192
01:59:24,998 --> 01:59:25,519
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Christy.

1193
01:59:25,539 --> 01:59:26,640
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have any questions.

1194
01:59:26,700 --> 01:59:33,686
[SPEAKER_06]: I think all the questions that the board members and the city staff have raised and the comments have been great, and I have nothing more to add to that.

1195
01:59:34,206 --> 01:59:37,529
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have a statement that I appreciate the presentation.

1196
01:59:37,569 --> 01:59:43,914
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was very well done and thorough, and I support the project.

1197
01:59:43,975 --> 01:59:45,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a no-brainer.

1198
01:59:50,198 --> 01:59:51,658
[SPEAKER_09]: I have no further questions.

1199
01:59:52,659 --> 01:59:53,039
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1200
01:59:53,639 --> 01:59:57,920
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me open the public participation portion of the hearing.

1201
01:59:58,721 --> 02:00:05,383
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there anybody on the Zoom who would like to speak?

1202
02:00:06,703 --> 02:00:12,185
[SPEAKER_10]: And let me just get the information so you could also, if you're watching remotely, participate.

1203
02:00:19,807 --> 02:00:35,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, if you are watching from home, you can submit questions and comments by email to OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

1204
02:00:35,451 --> 02:00:39,652
[SPEAKER_10]: That's OCD at Medford-MA.gov.

1205
02:00:40,432 --> 02:00:41,632
[SPEAKER_10]: Or you can call 781-393-4222.

1206
02:00:46,003 --> 02:00:47,124
[SPEAKER_10]: 2480.

1207
02:00:46,143 --> 02:00:47,124
[SPEAKER_10]: That's 781-393-2480.

1208
02:00:47,144 --> 02:00:58,512
[SPEAKER_10]: And there'll be a city staff who will respond to you and make sure that we get your comments.

1209
02:01:03,796 --> 02:01:11,522
[SPEAKER_10]: So while we wait a couple of minutes to see if we get anybody there, is there anybody here on the Zoom call who would like to speak?

1210
02:01:36,227 --> 02:01:48,336
[SPEAKER_10]: So in the meantime, let me just take a minute to ask the proponent if the pedestrian crossing, how do you have the sidewalk crossing in front of the loading dock treated right now?

1211
02:01:48,396 --> 02:01:49,937
[SPEAKER_10]: Could you just clarify that one more time?

1212
02:01:53,459 --> 02:01:53,820
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure.

1213
02:01:53,880 --> 02:01:56,962
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a painted crosswalk across the driveway apron.

1214
02:01:57,983 --> 02:02:03,326
[SPEAKER_19]: So it's just the asphalt continues from Sycamore Avenue into the site.

1215
02:02:03,807 --> 02:02:04,127
[SPEAKER_19]: And it's a,

1216
02:02:05,269 --> 02:02:06,650
[SPEAKER_19]: Just a painted crosswalk at this point.

1217
02:02:12,274 --> 02:02:13,515
[SPEAKER_10]: You have a problem with putting in.

1218
02:02:17,043 --> 02:02:26,506
[SPEAKER_10]: Not a graded one across, but a different kind of a treatment that continues the sidewalk, even if it's at the street grade.

1219
02:02:26,526 --> 02:02:37,529
[SPEAKER_19]: So basically, if we continue the sidewalk at whatever the slope is of the driveway, but continuous without having to do the apron up, I think we could be amenable to that.

1220
02:02:37,549 --> 02:02:42,671
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't want to speak for Matt, but my one concern was truck maneuverability in and out.

1221
02:02:43,599 --> 02:02:46,200
[SPEAKER_19]: But if it's at grade, that's an excellent solution.

1222
02:02:47,341 --> 02:02:49,021
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, yeah, I understand.

1223
02:02:50,122 --> 02:02:52,143
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, we'd definitely be open-minded to doing that.

1224
02:02:52,163 --> 02:02:53,824
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you.

1225
02:02:59,506 --> 02:03:03,688
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, Amanda, have we gotten any comments or questions from the public?

1226
02:03:03,708 --> 02:03:07,530
[SPEAKER_16]: I think somebody just said yes, Bill, that she has a question.

1227
02:03:08,050 --> 02:03:08,370
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1228
02:03:10,177 --> 02:03:13,418
[SPEAKER_10]: Espel, I don't know if that is that your first name.

1229
02:03:13,438 --> 02:03:16,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe the city staff can unmute you.

1230
02:03:18,820 --> 02:03:24,241
[SPEAKER_10]: And just a reminder to state your name and address for the record before you ask your question.

1231
02:03:24,862 --> 02:03:31,443
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so my name is Erin Bell, and I am 108 Otis Street.

1232
02:03:32,184 --> 02:03:38,406
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Oxford looks for new tenants, just in terms of development in Medford, what do you see from that area?

1233
02:03:40,325 --> 02:03:49,708
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of being a little bit familiar with the area, having, wondering, you know, what you're seeing with this, knowing the storage units and kind of what else is on that street.

1234
02:03:51,528 --> 02:04:03,592
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so is the question about like who is looking at these or is it more, um, like the tenants you're looking at and then what do you see maybe in five years for Medford for that area?

1235
02:04:04,312 --> 02:04:08,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, as, as a Tufts alumni and kind of seeing the, uh, 200 Boston Ave,

1236
02:04:10,510 --> 02:04:12,091
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that.

1237
02:04:12,491 --> 02:04:29,677
[SPEAKER_00]: Just wondering kind of what you see with the growth, especially as we see the expansion of Harvard, which kind of pushed so much up to Somerville and Medford and just from the town and kind of your interest in this, especially as you're looking at tenants.

1238
02:04:30,117 --> 02:04:30,777
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, absolutely.

1239
02:04:30,837 --> 02:04:31,858
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would say that

1240
02:04:33,077 --> 02:04:37,078
[SPEAKER_16]: when you first looking at this space in terms of just GMP in Boston, right?

1241
02:04:37,138 --> 02:04:40,879
[SPEAKER_16]: And nationally, we talked about it a little earlier.

1242
02:04:40,899 --> 02:04:43,419
[SPEAKER_16]: We look at like an hour within the city limits, right?

1243
02:04:43,479 --> 02:04:46,380
[SPEAKER_16]: And then you start to pressure test that a little bit.

1244
02:04:47,340 --> 02:04:59,383
[SPEAKER_16]: And what we see for this space is I really do believe that Medford has some unique opportunity to become a leader in this type of life science, as well as life science just in general.

1245
02:04:59,803 --> 02:05:00,963
[SPEAKER_16]: So we believe that,

1246
02:05:01,647 --> 02:05:09,208
[SPEAKER_16]: there's going to be a cluster here and we'd like to own as much of a cluster as possible because we've talked about that ecosystem a little bit.

1247
02:05:09,228 --> 02:05:11,449
[SPEAKER_16]: We really do want that ecosystem to thrive.

1248
02:05:11,469 --> 02:05:15,629
[SPEAKER_16]: We can't just have one small component of the ecosystem.

1249
02:05:15,649 --> 02:05:26,991
[SPEAKER_16]: We want to have everything and be able to really, um, you know, both for us, our tenants in the surrounding neighborhood, be able to, to allow these, you know, these companies to grow, um, and remain in this area.

1250
02:05:27,332 --> 02:05:29,352
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, because there's the other option is not good for anybody.

1251
02:05:29,392 --> 02:05:30,012
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think so.

1252
02:05:30,918 --> 02:05:39,001
[SPEAKER_16]: What we've seen is that I think before us having something this close, there weren't many offerings inside of 128.

1253
02:05:39,121 --> 02:05:43,823
[SPEAKER_16]: And we've seen a lot of interest just from the speculation of us saying, hey, we may have a site.

1254
02:05:43,843 --> 02:05:45,823
[SPEAKER_16]: There's been a lot of interest in looking at this site.

1255
02:05:46,283 --> 02:05:48,484
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think others are taking notice in this area.

1256
02:05:48,524 --> 02:05:58,608
[SPEAKER_16]: And I do believe, and hopefully it's us as well, that there'll be a lot more proposals in front of you in the near future for this type of product, as well as R&D, which you guys have already seen a lot of.

1257
02:06:00,367 --> 02:06:03,870
[SPEAKER_16]: but we are, we are what we like to say, bullish on Medford.

1258
02:06:04,290 --> 02:06:15,179
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, so, uh, we do believe it has the unique qualities and the city that is, um, conscientious and willing to work with you to, to understand, Hey, these are our, our concerns.

1259
02:06:15,720 --> 02:06:15,920
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

1260
02:06:15,960 --> 02:06:18,382
[SPEAKER_16]: If we address these, let's, let's work together to move forward.

1261
02:06:18,402 --> 02:06:21,624
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think, you know, cities really, I mean, uh, companies really embrace that.

1262
02:06:21,725 --> 02:06:25,748
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's probably a long winded way of saying that we just really given that.

1263
02:06:25,848 --> 02:06:27,029
[SPEAKER_16]: So, um,

1264
02:06:27,844 --> 02:06:35,288
[SPEAKER_16]: Hopefully we can prove it out to you in the next year and five years from now, there's a great ecosystem and cluster that's existing in Medford.

1265
02:06:36,589 --> 02:06:37,810
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your answer, Matt.

1266
02:06:38,150 --> 02:06:43,333
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually my parents' address, but I also will confess I'm the porous pavement person.

1267
02:06:43,693 --> 02:06:44,433
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I saw that.

1268
02:06:44,473 --> 02:06:46,074
[SPEAKER_15]: I was looking forward to your question.

1269
02:06:46,955 --> 02:06:52,258
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am a structural engineer and doing research in porous asphalt.

1270
02:06:53,327 --> 02:07:10,583
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a faculty, so that was something that I always think of when I see parking decks is porous asphalt, and especially from a stormwater management standpoint, because whenever there's a big storm, people always think it was, it's their flooding problem.

1271
02:07:10,623 --> 02:07:11,443
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not their flooding problem.

1272
02:07:11,463 --> 02:07:12,905
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a stormwater management problem.

1273
02:07:12,925 --> 02:07:14,326
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you have a problem.

1274
02:07:14,806 --> 02:07:17,809
[SPEAKER_00]: So I will confess, but thank you very much for your answer.

1275
02:07:18,303 --> 02:07:19,024
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I appreciate that.

1276
02:07:19,084 --> 02:07:30,573
[SPEAKER_16]: And quite honestly, separate from this, whatever you learn, send it to me if you can, if you get my contact information through this, because like I said, we're globally looking at things to try to be better, both our product and the environment.

1277
02:07:31,874 --> 02:07:38,959
[SPEAKER_16]: And we do want to get, even to Alicia's point, we do want to get to net zero on these type of projects, which is going to be coming sooner than we think.

1278
02:07:39,019 --> 02:07:42,302
[SPEAKER_16]: So anyways, we're trying to be responsible, but.

1279
02:07:42,882 --> 02:07:44,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I appreciate and respect that.

1280
02:07:46,494 --> 02:07:52,377
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always looking for ways that there's a nexus between energy and our usage and our need.

1281
02:07:54,117 --> 02:07:57,839
[SPEAKER_00]: Side note, I have a tidal turbine on a bridge in New Hampshire.

1282
02:07:57,859 --> 02:08:02,040
[SPEAKER_00]: So I look at nexus between transportation and energy and sustainability as well.

1283
02:08:03,681 --> 02:08:06,642
[SPEAKER_16]: Man, I'm about to contact you after this.

1284
02:08:12,081 --> 02:08:12,962
[SPEAKER_16]: That's my other question.

1285
02:08:13,042 --> 02:08:18,085
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, I was just gonna say that's why not having these in person anymore is so detrimental.

1286
02:08:18,105 --> 02:08:19,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Recording stopped.

1287
02:08:23,970 --> 02:08:26,111
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you want to continue the recording?

1288
02:08:27,112 --> 02:08:28,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Recording in progress.

1289
02:08:28,353 --> 02:08:30,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry about that.

1290
02:08:30,534 --> 02:08:31,595
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how that happened.

1291
02:08:33,937 --> 02:08:34,197
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

1292
02:08:34,297 --> 02:08:36,459
[SPEAKER_10]: Any other questions by members of the public?

1293
02:08:38,240 --> 02:08:40,842
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't believe any emails or calls have come in.

1294
02:08:46,319 --> 02:08:51,903
[SPEAKER_10]: I do have one other thing that occurred to me, Matt.

1295
02:08:51,963 --> 02:09:12,137
[SPEAKER_10]: So with the kinds of tenants coming in and this being manufacturing, I'm wondering if you could address a little bit more how trash and waste is going to be handled on the site, and is it possible that there would be any medical or biohazard

1296
02:09:13,175 --> 02:09:13,735
[SPEAKER_10]: material?

1297
02:09:15,397 --> 02:09:19,980
[SPEAKER_16]: No, I knew you would ask that question and I wish I was an expert in that portion of it.

1298
02:09:20,600 --> 02:09:39,614
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, I, I don't know if anybody else on our team can talk to it, but I'll quickly just state that, um, we have many different types of assets in our portfolio globally, and these are considered to be the most cleanliness rated ones for anything that we've ever had because they are so regulated by the FDA.

1299
02:09:40,138 --> 02:09:43,761
[SPEAKER_16]: So many people think these facilities are going to be dirty, and they have all this waste and things like that.

1300
02:09:43,801 --> 02:09:49,346
[SPEAKER_16]: You see none of it as a neighbor or as an operator or a landlord.

1301
02:09:50,567 --> 02:09:56,753
[SPEAKER_16]: But maybe some of my team can actually intelligently say why that's the case, because I'm not the person that can do that.

1302
02:09:56,793 --> 02:09:57,514
[SPEAKER_16]: I apologize.

1303
02:09:58,995 --> 02:10:04,480
[SPEAKER_16]: I can get your documentation further later on it, but I don't know if, John, you have anything you can opine on that.

1304
02:10:05,903 --> 02:10:29,208
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I was just going to kind of echo what you have said, Matt, just that because there's such a high level of regulation for how these spaces work, all of the material that's coming out of the spaces goes through such a process before it gets to, you know, gets to the loading dock door that, again, you know, we do a lot of, you know, just research buildings, which are also, you know, highly regulated and also

1305
02:10:29,948 --> 02:10:39,150
[SPEAKER_11]: extremely safe, but just the amount of process that's associated with this type of space is just elevated so that all of that material is very controlled.

1306
02:10:39,170 --> 02:10:47,432
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, I'm sure there are others that can say that better than me, but that's been our experience with how these GMP buildings are starting to work.

1307
02:10:47,452 --> 02:10:58,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I would just add that in our application materials, it does say that we would be contracting with a private waste hauler for waste removal and to the extent that a specialized hauler is needed.

1308
02:10:58,755 --> 02:11:06,718
[SPEAKER_05]: hauler is necessary for any biohazard material or medical waste, then the appropriate contractor would be engaged.

1309
02:11:06,938 --> 02:11:08,939
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wouldn't be a burden to the city.

1310
02:11:12,101 --> 02:11:18,523
[SPEAKER_10]: And with that waste disposal, is that happening through the loading docks or is that some other?

1311
02:11:18,543 --> 02:11:24,546
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, so they have a designated area on what we would call the

1312
02:11:26,004 --> 02:11:27,325
[SPEAKER_16]: the outflow side, right?

1313
02:11:27,605 --> 02:11:30,927
[SPEAKER_16]: They have six lock docks, they may have three for incoming, three for outloading.

1314
02:11:30,947 --> 02:11:47,237
[SPEAKER_16]: But I think it's important to note, just to John and I's point that, you know, all because it's so regulated within the facility, this waste will actually sit in their facility, and it's completely contained, right within their facility, because it has to be so, so separated from anything.

1315
02:11:47,638 --> 02:11:51,320
[SPEAKER_16]: So it's just another competence, the fact that these people

1316
02:11:52,266 --> 02:11:54,667
[SPEAKER_16]: do the process all the way through to the storage part.

1317
02:11:54,767 --> 02:11:57,508
[SPEAKER_16]: They wait for the waste truck to come up, they load the waste truck and it goes.

1318
02:11:57,589 --> 02:12:05,212
[SPEAKER_16]: But we've been operating these for a few years now and I've never seen visibly any evidence of the waste.

1319
02:12:06,613 --> 02:12:10,995
[SPEAKER_16]: But again, I'm not, I should get somebody to send a statement over about that.

1320
02:12:12,055 --> 02:12:17,518
[SPEAKER_10]: But no, I mean, as far as I can tell, there's no external like dumpster or container or anything.

1321
02:12:18,157 --> 02:12:24,625
[SPEAKER_16]: There is a compactor, a typical compactor, but that's more for just general waste, like what an office and lab would be.

1322
02:12:25,086 --> 02:12:25,426
[SPEAKER_16]: Right, John?

1323
02:12:26,748 --> 02:12:27,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, that's right.

1324
02:12:27,589 --> 02:12:31,774
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's located on the site next to the generator adjacent to the loading base.

1325
02:12:42,785 --> 02:12:50,793
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think we should try to summarize some of the things that we've discussed.

1326
02:12:50,813 --> 02:12:55,358
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if Amanda, you have notes that you can start us off with.

1327
02:12:57,180 --> 02:12:59,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, let me pull them up here.

1328
02:13:01,021 --> 02:13:07,183
[SPEAKER_04]: So I apologize in advance if I didn't capture these in the most eloquent way or if I've miscaptured them.

1329
02:13:07,283 --> 02:13:11,085
[SPEAKER_04]: So feel free everyone to chime in and we can adjust as necessary.

1330
02:13:13,546 --> 02:13:26,811
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have a condition here to provide design graphics or art for the front facade of the building or explore design for the facade of the building.

1331
02:13:28,644 --> 02:13:34,186
[SPEAKER_04]: Utilize tree wells to capture stormwater from parking lot and support larger shade trees.

1332
02:13:35,806 --> 02:13:41,808
[SPEAKER_04]: Include language outlining expectations regarding the tank and screening that staff can review.

1333
02:13:44,509 --> 02:13:53,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Consider permeable paver in pedestrian areas and explore the use of porous pavement for parking spots and normal asphalt for drive lanes.

1334
02:13:55,554 --> 02:13:59,796
[SPEAKER_04]: continue the sidewalk across the driveway in front of the tank farm.

1335
02:14:02,138 --> 02:14:08,601
[SPEAKER_04]: And Alicia's adding an edited version here, just waiting for her to finish typing.

1336
02:14:09,922 --> 02:14:21,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Todd had mentioned the potential for increasing pedestrian access by inclusion of accessibility wheelchair ramps and crosswalks along Riverside Ave and crossing Sycamore Ave.

1337
02:14:24,532 --> 02:14:27,414
[SPEAKER_04]: and compliance with Medford Solar Ordinance.

1338
02:14:32,998 --> 02:14:39,863
[SPEAKER_02]: So one thing we usually state is incorporation of department head letters.

1339
02:14:41,504 --> 02:14:43,686
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't really discuss some of them.

1340
02:14:43,746 --> 02:14:46,728
[SPEAKER_02]: We really focused on the ones where there were responses.

1341
02:14:47,689 --> 02:14:52,832
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just sort of briefly looking at the Board of Health seem to have submitted a letter that is

1342
02:14:54,478 --> 02:15:10,989
[SPEAKER_02]: just standard thing that I assume that there's no concerns or questions about any of their statements, that they're all just standard construction, rodent control type stuff.

1343
02:15:11,589 --> 02:15:13,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, let me just phrase it as a little bit differently.

1344
02:15:13,731 --> 02:15:20,055
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, is there anything in the department headletters that you have trouble complying with?

1345
02:15:21,255 --> 02:15:23,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I just add, we never received a Board of Health

1346
02:15:23,997 --> 02:15:24,697
[SPEAKER_05]: comment letter.

1347
02:15:24,717 --> 02:15:26,699
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't shared with the applicant.

1348
02:15:26,819 --> 02:15:33,563
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you could forward that to us so that we can at least briefly review it to make sure we know what we're implying to you.

1349
02:15:34,003 --> 02:15:34,724
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

1350
02:15:34,804 --> 02:15:35,965
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me do that right away.

1351
02:15:40,647 --> 02:15:52,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I will tell you that as I skimmed through it, my impression was that it was all standard dust remediation, noise remediation during construction stuff.

1352
02:15:53,844 --> 02:15:58,005
[SPEAKER_02]: adequate drainage plan for groundwater management.

1353
02:16:00,146 --> 02:16:04,787
[SPEAKER_02]: Solid waste, that there must be a solid waste plan provided to the Board of Health for approval.

1354
02:16:05,347 --> 02:16:07,648
[SPEAKER_02]: Permit must be obtained for all dumpsters.

1355
02:16:08,728 --> 02:16:12,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Removal and disposal practices must comply with dumpster regulations.

1356
02:16:13,933 --> 02:16:16,234
[SPEAKER_02]: Receptacles must be kept clean and sanitary.

1357
02:16:17,375 --> 02:16:19,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Temporary septic.

1358
02:16:19,836 --> 02:16:23,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Installation of temporary septic port-a-potties for construction.

1359
02:16:23,778 --> 02:16:28,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Protection of existing businesses.

1360
02:16:31,442 --> 02:16:34,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Conditions must be kept sanitary for existing businesses.

1361
02:16:34,984 --> 02:16:36,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Plan has to be submitted to the Board of Health.

1362
02:16:38,999 --> 02:16:44,483
[SPEAKER_02]: They require a list of 24 by 7 contacts to notify during demolition and construction.

1363
02:16:44,503 --> 02:16:52,370
[SPEAKER_02]: These are basically standard demolition items.

1364
02:16:52,770 --> 02:16:56,193
[SPEAKER_02]: There must be a Board of Health inspection afterwards.

1365
02:16:59,195 --> 02:17:05,160
[SPEAKER_02]: It's under additional concerns

1366
02:17:05,652 --> 02:17:11,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Thorough information regarding the actual scope of operations should be submitted to the health department for review and approval.

1367
02:17:12,059 --> 02:17:16,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Any and all biomedical processes may be subject to additional requirements from the department.

1368
02:17:18,685 --> 02:17:23,110
[SPEAKER_02]: As more information the project has submitted, additional concerns and requirements may be imposed.

1369
02:17:29,341 --> 02:17:32,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I just saw one that I hadn't seen in their letters before.

1370
02:17:33,182 --> 02:17:39,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Green space to allow drainage and reduce the heat index on the property must be included with tree coverage available.

1371
02:17:40,803 --> 02:17:43,484
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, that was new for Department of Health letter.

1372
02:17:44,344 --> 02:17:47,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Permeable pavement should be used for drainage purposes.

1373
02:17:58,200 --> 02:17:59,820
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Board of Health letter.

1374
02:18:00,821 --> 02:18:04,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I assume you saw the fire department letter, right?

1375
02:18:05,102 --> 02:18:11,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you did, you responded to that one.

1376
02:18:13,924 --> 02:18:14,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

1377
02:18:14,204 --> 02:18:23,027
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, you know, the Board of Health, like the green space one and the permeable pavement, that was all in additional concerns.

1378
02:18:23,247 --> 02:18:24,707
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's, uh,

1379
02:18:26,928 --> 02:18:30,629
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't necessarily call those requirements.

1380
02:18:33,411 --> 02:18:55,119
[SPEAKER_10]: I think those are, you know, to the extent viable, the ones that are more requirements of the integrated pest management, you know, identification of any underground storage tanks or hazardous materials, the dust remediation, noise remediation,

1381
02:18:58,107 --> 02:19:17,801
[SPEAKER_10]: drainage plan, solid waste, porta-potties, and then submitting a plan to keep the condition sanitary during the demolition process.

1382
02:19:24,846 --> 02:19:25,807
[SPEAKER_16]: And those make sense to us.

1383
02:19:25,867 --> 02:19:27,028
[SPEAKER_16]: I think you mentioned

1384
02:19:28,741 --> 02:19:29,821
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry, do I have an echo now?

1385
02:19:30,522 --> 02:19:30,702
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

1386
02:19:31,042 --> 02:19:37,444
[SPEAKER_16]: I think you mentioned that a few that were actually related specifically to what the tenant process would be.

1387
02:19:37,464 --> 02:19:42,826
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think, you know, Andre, I think there's a couple of good points you made.

1388
02:19:42,906 --> 02:19:44,766
[SPEAKER_16]: There's a couple items, like how do you condition this?

1389
02:19:44,826 --> 02:19:50,548
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm wondering, and I think Valerie's gonna talk to it as well, but is there a way to condition a little bit to the tenant, right?

1390
02:19:50,568 --> 02:19:55,450
[SPEAKER_16]: Because we won't be able to tell you what the use is, but we also won't be able to get a tenant unless we,

1391
02:19:56,227 --> 02:19:58,569
[SPEAKER_16]: get a core and shell to a certain extent, right?

1392
02:19:58,589 --> 02:20:13,481
[SPEAKER_16]: So I would imagine there's some components like the tank farm, the actual, how we do that screening, things like that, as well as Board of Health, which we would imagine would be addressed at the tenant time that we can condition.

1393
02:20:13,521 --> 02:20:21,327
[SPEAKER_16]: The only one I think that maybe we need to just talk about a little bit and how do we condition is the facade, which I think was a concern to you.

1394
02:20:21,347 --> 02:20:23,549
[SPEAKER_16]: And I think we want to do something better for this facade.

1395
02:20:23,589 --> 02:20:24,010
[SPEAKER_16]: I just don't,

1396
02:20:26,656 --> 02:20:31,359
[SPEAKER_16]: not positive what that is yet, but I do think we could resolve it pretty quickly here.

1397
02:20:31,379 --> 02:20:33,040
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know what it needs to be.

1398
02:20:33,060 --> 02:20:39,443
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm a little hesitant to make it look like the rest of the building because it is a loading docked area that will never quite match up.

1399
02:20:39,504 --> 02:20:46,728
[SPEAKER_16]: I liked your idea about whether it's artwork or something that makes that just feel like a better building coming across.

1400
02:20:46,808 --> 02:20:51,370
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure, John, if you had any thoughts while we've been sitting here.

1401
02:20:51,390 --> 02:20:55,133
[SPEAKER_11]: I certainly think maybe that

1402
02:20:56,144 --> 02:21:03,211
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know how it ties into the process, but something that we can review downstream as staff or with the group.

1403
02:21:03,251 --> 02:21:12,399
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think that there are ways to bring some of those materials around and turn the corner or extend some of those elements on the facade itself.

1404
02:21:13,832 --> 02:21:19,596
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, opportunities for art on the screen walls or on some of those other elements I think could be, you know, could be interesting.

1405
02:21:19,876 --> 02:21:22,158
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, I love the idea of a mural on some portion of the building.

1406
02:21:22,198 --> 02:21:28,822
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just hard to know exactly what that right thing would be until we know exactly how the building's being used and who's in it.

1407
02:21:29,323 --> 02:21:37,489
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think kind of short of that, there could certainly be some ways to carry some of the materiality around some corners and extend it onto that Sycamore facade too.

1408
02:21:38,189 --> 02:21:43,652
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, give it a more kind of consistent appearance towards the street that it has when it starts to turn around the other side.

1409
02:21:43,672 --> 02:21:45,833
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1410
02:21:46,293 --> 02:22:04,503
[SPEAKER_05]: To that point, I think perhaps the way to solve for that is a condition that once we've identified a tenant before we pull a permit for a tenant fit out that perhaps the staff could further review the design that we would submit additional detail of the

1411
02:22:05,048 --> 02:22:08,309
[SPEAKER_05]: the facade and the tank screening at that point.

1412
02:22:09,269 --> 02:22:17,950
[SPEAKER_05]: If we get a 10 that doesn't require any tanks and perhaps we're able to integrate more landscaping at that point but we won't we won't know that at this stage of permitting.

1413
02:22:25,392 --> 02:22:31,113
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm a question for either the director Hans or even Victor have

1414
02:22:32,527 --> 02:22:46,841
[SPEAKER_10]: You dealt with these situations before where you had the spec development and then you have the tenants require some additional kind of design feedback loop.

1415
02:22:48,062 --> 02:22:49,263
[SPEAKER_10]: And what's the best way to handle that?

1416
02:22:49,303 --> 02:22:51,145
[SPEAKER_10]: I think as Ms.

1417
02:22:51,185 --> 02:22:52,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Morris suggested, I'm happy to

1418
02:22:54,278 --> 02:23:14,945
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, to have a condition that would have the proponent come back at a future time just for, you know, feedback and final approval of the, you know, of the design.

1419
02:23:14,985 --> 02:23:22,048
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have to, you know, figure out the language, but I would like the board to be able to actually see it, not just staff.

1420
02:23:27,138 --> 02:23:38,987
[SPEAKER_05]: Could I suggest that that proceed through a public meeting rather than a public hearing, and that it be just a simple board approval rather than... Yeah.

1421
02:23:40,528 --> 02:23:41,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Absolutely, not a public hearing.

1422
02:23:45,712 --> 02:23:47,433
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's something that could work.

1423
02:23:47,993 --> 02:23:48,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1424
02:23:48,313 --> 02:23:51,476
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just sort of thinking about the logistics of it.

1425
02:23:51,496 --> 02:23:54,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say that

1426
02:23:56,216 --> 02:24:05,201
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have enough experience with these personally to be able to say what has worked for us in the past.

1427
02:24:06,182 --> 02:24:10,705
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if Victor would from a different from his previous position.

1428
02:24:10,725 --> 02:24:15,527
[SPEAKER_02]: I think newer to the city than I am, but

1429
02:24:17,779 --> 02:24:22,202
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't, so they will be issued another building permit for tenant fit out.

1430
02:24:22,763 --> 02:24:25,624
[SPEAKER_02]: That does not necessarily run through our office.

1431
02:24:26,485 --> 02:24:28,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, we wouldn't sign off on it.

1432
02:24:28,466 --> 02:24:42,076
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things that I'm sort of thinking about is how do we put a flag in there that the building department is aware that actually in this case it does need to run through our office for tenant fit out.

1433
02:24:43,297 --> 02:24:43,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

1434
02:24:45,748 --> 02:24:47,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's something that we can figure out.

1435
02:24:52,430 --> 02:25:05,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I do wanna ask, it sounds like the board would be willing to include, potentially approve this tonight with a number of conditions that a proponent will do this, will do that.

1436
02:25:06,575 --> 02:25:13,697
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanna, would it be easier for the proponent to review some of this stuff and come back

1437
02:25:15,008 --> 02:25:24,632
[SPEAKER_02]: next month with like this is exactly what we're doing versus we could get the approvals through this evening.

1438
02:25:24,652 --> 02:25:36,796
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I want to be clear because I feel like a lot of a number of these things are fairly nebulous and I like to have very concrete conditions that when

1439
02:25:37,483 --> 02:25:44,946
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody's asking for their occupancy permit or building permit, I'm walking out there with the list saying, did you do this check?

1440
02:25:44,986 --> 02:25:45,646
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you do that?

1441
02:25:46,287 --> 02:25:51,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Versus an owner saying to me, well, I thought you meant this.

1442
02:25:51,349 --> 02:25:54,970
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're saying, but we thought we meant this because it's not clear enough.

1443
02:25:55,430 --> 02:26:02,373
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just, I sort of want to raise that to make sure we're all on the same page for these.

1444
02:26:03,641 --> 02:26:09,945
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Director Hunt, I agree with you about the specifics, but I probably they're not going to have a tenant in the next month.

1445
02:26:09,985 --> 02:26:13,567
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know if it makes doesn't make sense to continue it that way.

1446
02:26:14,027 --> 02:26:23,092
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we're going to have to just figure out how to word the conditions in a way that there is a feedback loop and that when they have

1447
02:26:25,682 --> 02:26:31,007
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I mean, we're not a board that's going to like pull the rug out from, from, from under you at all.

1448
02:26:31,047 --> 02:26:34,150
[SPEAKER_10]: We just want to, I think, see the final product.

1449
02:26:34,271 --> 02:26:43,880
[SPEAKER_10]: And once you have those final designs and provide, you know, some, you know, feedback and endorsement at that time.

1450
02:26:43,900 --> 02:26:48,905
[SPEAKER_16]: And I could be, oh, sorry.

1451
02:26:49,045 --> 02:26:49,185
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry.

1452
02:26:49,205 --> 02:26:49,406
[SPEAKER_16]: Go ahead.

1453
02:26:50,382 --> 02:27:11,922
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we can address that through a condition that just requires that prior to pulling a tenant fit out permit that we come back and appear before this board at a regularly scheduled public meeting for the board's subsequent approval of it sounds like parts of the facade and the screening.

1454
02:27:13,528 --> 02:27:32,845
[SPEAKER_05]: and the feasibility of permeable paving, some of these sort of more open-ended items that I don't think we're in a position to refine at this point, and we probably won't be able to refine them until we're able to take down part of the building and start to do some of the site work and the shell work that goes into this.

1455
02:27:32,865 --> 02:27:38,710
[SPEAKER_05]: We've seen this done in other communities certainly, so it's

1456
02:27:39,230 --> 02:27:42,031
[SPEAKER_05]: we can work a condition to address that.

1457
02:27:42,431 --> 02:27:47,073
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, could you sort of help me with the process that you're anticipating here?

1458
02:27:47,114 --> 02:27:52,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, you don't know our details, but there's a permit.

1459
02:27:53,636 --> 02:27:55,597
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at demolition here.

1460
02:27:55,717 --> 02:27:58,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally, we're looking at construction.

1461
02:27:58,779 --> 02:28:01,340
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is going to issue a demolition permit.

1462
02:28:01,960 --> 02:28:08,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to be looking for an occupancy permit before you come for a fit-out permit?

1463
02:28:10,246 --> 02:28:23,097
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, it's actually, so we're looking for a construction permit, but we're looking for a demolition permit for the portion of the building, construction obviously to build like the mezzanine and to create that entire entry.

1464
02:28:23,737 --> 02:28:28,121
[SPEAKER_16]: And then we would not have a certificate of occupancy until a tenant came, right?

1465
02:28:28,141 --> 02:28:38,990
[SPEAKER_16]: It would be some form of a temporary or a substantial completion with the city until the tenant is in the space, obviously with fire department sign off and things of that nature to make sure it's a safe building.

1466
02:28:40,143 --> 02:28:45,908
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, but yeah that's that's what we'll be looking for right Valerie, that summarize that.

1467
02:28:46,209 --> 02:28:47,350
[SPEAKER_05]: That's exactly right.

1468
02:28:47,450 --> 02:28:56,398
[SPEAKER_05]: So the, the interior that I work for the tenant would require another building permit, and obviously, once we've identified a tenant, it's not a

1469
02:28:56,959 --> 02:29:11,311
[SPEAKER_05]: process to have their designs ready to pull that permit so there'll be plenty of time built into the schedule for us to appear at a public meeting and we'll work with the staff obviously to make sure that that works for you and adequate notices provided.

1470
02:29:11,892 --> 02:29:15,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Great, that's sort of what I wanted to ensure that there wouldn't be.

1471
02:29:17,823 --> 02:29:26,287
[SPEAKER_02]: the opportunity to accidentally fly under the radar, issue all the permits, suddenly, and that you had already gotten.

1472
02:29:26,747 --> 02:29:29,849
[SPEAKER_02]: So my office, I'll sign off on occupancy permits.

1473
02:29:30,609 --> 02:29:42,154
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you know that I'm not signing off on occupancy permit, unless you've come back in front of us for these other items, that's actually the check in the system that is very helpful.

1474
02:29:44,282 --> 02:29:49,448
[SPEAKER_02]: to be aware that you're aware that there's that check.

1475
02:29:50,589 --> 02:29:57,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Tim also has to sign off on occupancy permits, so he'll also be aware of some of these details.

1476
02:29:59,699 --> 02:30:21,638
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's sort of the the thing we we that the worst is when somebody comes to us for an occupancy permit and they think they've done everything and we say but remember this list of conditions that was issued three years ago you actually haven't met all of them and we're not signing the occupancy permit until you come back and and meet the list of conditions so

1477
02:30:22,215 --> 02:30:35,097
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess the, but is the point at which you come back to us before the, after the demolition permit, before the building permit, or is it before the occupancy permit?

1478
02:30:35,177 --> 02:30:40,338
[SPEAKER_10]: Because some of the things may, I mean, would that, wouldn't it affect the building permit at all?

1479
02:30:40,438 --> 02:30:41,519
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the screening maybe?

1480
02:30:41,919 --> 02:30:43,819
[SPEAKER_02]: There are going to be two building permits.

1481
02:30:44,899 --> 02:30:48,560
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that's the big, the big, larger things.

1482
02:30:49,242 --> 02:30:54,165
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's going to be a more detailed building permit once they've identified a tenant.

1483
02:30:54,765 --> 02:30:56,186
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I get that correct, Matt?

1484
02:30:56,986 --> 02:31:03,790
[SPEAKER_16]: It is, but I can see where Andre's going as well, is that, you know, in the core and shell, you want to address maybe the facade or the screening, right?

1485
02:31:03,830 --> 02:31:10,873
[SPEAKER_16]: So we are proposing to have the screening, which may or may not be needed, and the facade we need to iron out.

1486
02:31:11,333 --> 02:31:12,274
[SPEAKER_16]: The other components

1487
02:31:13,321 --> 02:31:14,382
[SPEAKER_16]: I think are all addressable.

1488
02:31:14,402 --> 02:31:18,403
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, I think we've already agreed that the crosswalk should be done, so that would just be a condition we do.

1489
02:31:19,203 --> 02:31:28,207
[SPEAKER_16]: UVA ramps that, you know, traffic brought up was really, sorry, I was just looking for them and my screen disappeared.

1490
02:31:28,227 --> 02:31:31,368
[SPEAKER_16]: So that traffic brought up that we're going to address as well.

1491
02:31:32,769 --> 02:31:36,430
[SPEAKER_16]: You know, I would think that one of the conditions would actually be the solar, right?

1492
02:31:36,470 --> 02:31:40,251
[SPEAKER_16]: You'd want to say, like, we need to do the feasibility and look at, sorry, Todd, there you are.

1493
02:31:42,735 --> 02:31:46,798
[SPEAKER_16]: So those are pretty easy to be addressable.

1494
02:31:47,218 --> 02:31:49,419
[SPEAKER_16]: Our intention is the following, right?

1495
02:31:49,479 --> 02:32:05,770
[SPEAKER_16]: We need to get approval so we feel comfortable demoing and starting procuring this project because we need to bring this to market by next summer, which then the tenant, we need to try to bring in a tenant in the next three to four months to really get ramped up on their design.

1496
02:32:06,290 --> 02:32:09,872
[SPEAKER_16]: And in that period, before they file, it's going to take them a while to file.

1497
02:32:11,575 --> 02:32:15,236
[SPEAKER_16]: Best case, they're probably filing a year from now, right, with all the design they have to do.

1498
02:32:16,197 --> 02:32:30,742
[SPEAKER_16]: That period between the four months to a year is really where we bring in and understand their requirements and come back to the board and say, all right, we're building all this short of these two things that we were kind of leaving to go, but we were ready to proceed with that portion of it.

1499
02:32:32,012 --> 02:32:35,674
[SPEAKER_16]: because we aren't going to be going for a CFO for our core and shell.

1500
02:32:36,195 --> 02:32:40,297
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to be required to meet the conditions that we agreed to.

1501
02:32:41,217 --> 02:32:43,278
[SPEAKER_16]: Does that make sense on the facade and on the screen wall?

1502
02:32:43,638 --> 02:32:48,601
[SPEAKER_16]: I can't get anything signed off or done until then, I guess.

1503
02:32:49,141 --> 02:32:50,542
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm probably confusing you.

1504
02:32:51,102 --> 02:32:51,763
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, Matt.

1505
02:32:52,743 --> 02:32:55,805
[SPEAKER_10]: Were you agreeing with me or with Alicia on that?

1506
02:32:55,865 --> 02:32:58,426
[SPEAKER_16]: It was kind of in between, but what I was trying to say is that

1507
02:32:59,025 --> 02:33:06,628
[SPEAKER_16]: We're gonna, we will know generally who the tenant is before we are even at the stage where we're completing the corn shell.

1508
02:33:07,068 --> 02:33:15,812
[SPEAKER_16]: But the two components I think that are, one is the tank farm, which I actually don't think is much of a component other than just, if you don't need it, they're not gonna have it, right?

1509
02:33:15,852 --> 02:33:16,913
[SPEAKER_16]: We're just gonna make it look prettier.

1510
02:33:17,233 --> 02:33:18,893
[SPEAKER_16]: It's really down to the facade, right?

1511
02:33:18,913 --> 02:33:22,415
[SPEAKER_16]: And so how do we make sure that that facade is addressed in a way that makes sense?

1512
02:33:24,135 --> 02:33:34,538
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we want to understand what the tenant is, and a month after that, we're coming back to you to present, and it's well in advance of them filing for a permit, so that we can get the work done before they actually start their work.

1513
02:33:35,279 --> 02:33:38,360
[SPEAKER_10]: But you'll need your first building permit before that.

1514
02:33:38,900 --> 02:33:39,720
[SPEAKER_16]: We will, yep.

1515
02:33:40,560 --> 02:33:44,202
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, we'll need the building permit to get the mezzanine and all that going, because it's such a long lead item.

1516
02:33:47,420 --> 02:33:55,743
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll word it that before, you know, before final facade design, you know, work is done, you'll come back to the board.

1517
02:33:56,403 --> 02:33:56,603
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.

1518
02:33:58,204 --> 02:34:03,885
[SPEAKER_16]: Maybe just on that elevation, if that makes sense, just because the rest of it requires some long lead items as well with the glass.

1519
02:34:04,365 --> 02:34:06,366
[SPEAKER_16]: That'd be great.

1520
02:34:07,066 --> 02:34:09,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I think it's really the west elevation.

1521
02:34:09,907 --> 02:34:10,367
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

1522
02:34:11,868 --> 02:34:14,128
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there's the piece of the south.

1523
02:34:14,969 --> 02:34:15,449
[SPEAKER_16]: That'll wrap.

1524
02:34:16,393 --> 02:34:16,633
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1525
02:34:17,774 --> 02:34:17,894
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1526
02:34:17,914 --> 02:34:26,361
[SPEAKER_16]: You can condition it as such, as long as we've got kind of what we generally think is approved as part of this, that we can further that design while we think we'll be in good shape.

1527
02:34:35,328 --> 02:34:35,668
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1528
02:34:35,728 --> 02:34:36,589
[SPEAKER_10]: And I, and I agree.

1529
02:34:36,609 --> 02:34:39,491
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there is a lot of these conditions we have agreed on.

1530
02:34:39,551 --> 02:34:40,091
[SPEAKER_10]: We can just,

1531
02:34:42,402 --> 02:34:42,983
[SPEAKER_10]: clarify them.

1532
02:34:43,083 --> 02:35:01,173
[SPEAKER_10]: I do want to say generally we have something in there saying that, you know, the other, if we don't have a specific condition about it or address it particularly, then we say, you know, that the proponent has, will comply with the department's letters.

1533
02:35:01,894 --> 02:35:10,639
[SPEAKER_10]: I think in this case, we have to kind of exempt the historical commission letter from that because there,

1534
02:35:11,695 --> 02:35:16,499
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, they're not, they're sort of opining on design, but that's not in their jurisdiction.

1535
02:35:16,679 --> 02:35:19,121
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll leave that aside.

1536
02:35:20,762 --> 02:35:32,831
[SPEAKER_02]: We can handle that by saying that the proponent will comply with engineering, traffic, health, fire department letters per their, per proponent's response letters.

1537
02:35:32,931 --> 02:35:35,593
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can incorporate the proponent's response letters.

1538
02:35:41,832 --> 02:35:46,175
[SPEAKER_02]: we just don't mention the ones that we're not holding them to?

1539
02:35:55,381 --> 02:36:02,426
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the one thing that the Historic Commission did bring up, which we didn't ask, was whether there's an opportunity to create a little

1540
02:36:03,732 --> 02:36:11,034
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, a seating area, some kind of amenity over in the green space towards the rail.

1541
02:36:11,074 --> 02:36:13,895
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if there's enough room for that or if you thought about that.

1542
02:36:16,575 --> 02:36:25,698
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I could add on the rail, it is a really confined space and it is also

1543
02:36:26,431 --> 02:36:29,533
[SPEAKER_05]: still considered a railroad right-of-way by the state.

1544
02:36:30,114 --> 02:36:35,597
[SPEAKER_05]: So to add a seating area or structures would require approval from the Mass.

1545
02:36:35,617 --> 02:36:40,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Department of Transportation, which is something we don't currently require.

1546
02:36:40,701 --> 02:36:45,024
[SPEAKER_05]: So we haven't been planning to add such a seating area at this time.

1547
02:36:45,044 --> 02:36:54,050
[SPEAKER_05]: That said, if the city were to advance plans for the Greenway and it were to extend into this area, certainly at that time,

1548
02:36:54,735 --> 02:37:10,580
[SPEAKER_05]: because if you'd be working through the process of terminating the railroad right-of-way to do that, then that would present the opportunity for the applicant at that time to consider adding seating areas and other elements that would make that a more exciting greenway space.

1549
02:37:12,000 --> 02:37:23,604
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering if it would be beneficial to the city and amenable to the proponent to include a condition that says

1550
02:37:24,263 --> 02:37:43,210
[SPEAKER_02]: that the, that the proponent is amenable, you know, is willing to work with the city on any future Greenway development of the rail line so that eight years from now, 10 years from now, somebody could pull that out and say, Hey, you know, Matt's not here anymore.

1551
02:37:43,310 --> 02:37:46,692
[SPEAKER_02]: John's these guys aren't here anymore, but they said they'd work with us on it.

1552
02:37:46,712 --> 02:37:50,293
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, you can see.

1553
02:37:51,277 --> 02:37:57,459
[SPEAKER_16]: When we talked about it earlier, I mean, we basically positioned our entrance on that side so that it allows for that to be a potential in the future.

1554
02:37:57,479 --> 02:38:00,740
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we would hope it does become a potential in the future.

1555
02:38:00,760 --> 02:38:06,041
[SPEAKER_16]: So if you want a condition that we will, you know, be open and work with that, that's not an issue.

1556
02:38:06,081 --> 02:38:13,743
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we'd fully embrace that because that's another form of transportation that gets down to us and allows for another real amenity.

1557
02:38:15,444 --> 02:38:19,905
[SPEAKER_16]: Like I said earlier, SGA did links and links has a direct connection to

1558
02:38:21,202 --> 02:38:28,168
[SPEAKER_16]: like a old railway that's created into a into a bike way that it really does tell us I'm kind of that holistic design.

1559
02:38:29,950 --> 02:38:30,691
[SPEAKER_15]: Experience so.

1560
02:38:33,213 --> 02:38:34,214
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for that.

1561
02:38:34,994 --> 02:38:38,697
[SPEAKER_10]: So maybe something along the lines of the proponent.

1562
02:38:41,099 --> 02:38:44,222
[SPEAKER_10]: So participate in any planning effort.

1563
02:38:44,783 --> 02:38:46,304
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I mean you should really.

1564
02:38:46,737 --> 02:38:54,399
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, I mean, as I said, if I'm not here, good luck with that guy trying to figure it out, you know, but no, that's great.

1565
02:38:55,359 --> 02:38:55,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy to.

1566
02:38:56,099 --> 02:38:58,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Blake, Director of Traffic, you had your hand up.

1567
02:38:59,700 --> 02:39:07,662
[SPEAKER_01]: If they really want a seating area bench, we could have a placeholder put the bench out on Riverside Ave for the trains to stop until they determine that's needed later.

1568
02:39:21,435 --> 02:39:22,196
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know.

1569
02:39:24,397 --> 02:39:25,478
[SPEAKER_16]: Is there a need for a bench?

1570
02:39:25,518 --> 02:39:26,679
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry.

1571
02:39:26,699 --> 02:39:28,460
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if that was a joke, Todd.

1572
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:29,701
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't tell you that.

1573
02:39:30,341 --> 02:39:36,626
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a joke, but we can always add more transit amenities, so feel free to add some more.

1574
02:39:39,288 --> 02:39:47,614
[SPEAKER_16]: We'll try, but I don't know if I can get to a bench on Riverside, randomly faceted in, but we want to work with you guys as much as we can.

1575
02:39:47,674 --> 02:39:49,495
[SPEAKER_16]: But I'm hoping that us,

1576
02:39:49,891 --> 02:39:50,791
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know if this is solving it.

1577
02:39:50,811 --> 02:40:01,675
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm hoping that us creating a lot of bike parking stuff will drive this a little further and maybe hopefully the greenway will extend and they'll see that there's a bunch of people biking and they need a better route.

1578
02:40:02,976 --> 02:40:04,176
[SPEAKER_16]: So hopefully that's the case.

1579
02:40:05,337 --> 02:40:11,519
[SPEAKER_10]: And actually, Todd, I have one question about the crosswalk on Riverside.

1580
02:40:12,199 --> 02:40:14,540
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that just restriping the one at the intersection?

1581
02:40:14,560 --> 02:40:17,361
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not talking about a new crosswalk, are we?

1582
02:40:18,352 --> 02:40:19,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it would be new.

1583
02:40:19,313 --> 02:40:23,457
[SPEAKER_01]: So across Sycamore, it would be striping it where it should be.

1584
02:40:23,917 --> 02:40:33,746
[SPEAKER_01]: Across Riverside would be a brand new one to facilitate crossings from anyone from the dead end of Sycamore to get across the street to utilize the bus stop on the other side.

1585
02:40:33,766 --> 02:40:41,714
[SPEAKER_10]: So you probably have to put like a pedestrian priority sign in the middle somewhere.

1586
02:40:41,734 --> 02:40:42,655
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

1587
02:40:43,448 --> 02:40:50,952
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if the traffic commission approved it would involve accessible ramp on either side because it's required for any new crosswalk.

1588
02:40:50,992 --> 02:41:00,877
[SPEAKER_01]: And then standard aluminum metal warning signs would be as well, W11-2, the fluorescent yellow green pedestrian walkway signs.

1589
02:41:01,318 --> 02:41:05,600
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if the chair or the CD board thinks that's

1590
02:41:06,412 --> 02:41:15,176
[SPEAKER_01]: A concern of theirs, you could also suggest including enhanced elements such as flashing border or something like that as well.

1591
02:41:16,817 --> 02:41:29,963
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems like you may be suggesting a median in the middle, which isn't necessarily a bad idea, but the lane structure, the lane configuration on Riverside Ave has the opportunity, has the potential to include bike lane both directions in this segment.

1592
02:41:30,503 --> 02:41:33,765
[SPEAKER_01]: So we wouldn't necessarily want to preclude that by adding a median.

1593
02:41:35,689 --> 02:41:43,292
[SPEAKER_10]: I wasn't thinking about a median, I was just thinking about, if people are crossing not at a light, then it could be dangerous.

1594
02:41:46,073 --> 02:42:02,140
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you could also consider on the parking side opposite Sycamore, you could consider a bump out for that wheelchair ramp so that it's more visible to the drivers driving by, and the crossing distance would become shorter as well.

1595
02:42:03,230 --> 02:42:08,134
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the south side of Riverside, there's a parking shoulder, but on the north side, there's no parking.

1596
02:42:08,854 --> 02:42:17,120
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you added a crosswalk and added a bump out on the south side, it would reduce the crossing distance a little bit and provide better sight lines.

1597
02:42:17,140 --> 02:42:23,725
[SPEAKER_10]: Does the proponent have any thoughts about this?

1598
02:42:28,129 --> 02:42:29,149
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a good idea.

1599
02:42:29,169 --> 02:42:31,151
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think people will walk down to the

1600
02:42:32,312 --> 02:42:36,975
[SPEAKER_09]: signal to get to the, to cross, to get back to the bus stop.

1601
02:42:40,037 --> 02:42:40,618
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to be clear.

1602
02:42:40,638 --> 02:42:56,228
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're talking about, I think the, I mean, the only place that makes sense, I think to put it in would be from the West sidewalk of Sycamore to the East sidewalk of Linden street, because putting it over more

1603
02:42:59,532 --> 02:43:03,636
[SPEAKER_10]: From the other side, you get into the parking entrance, right?

1604
02:43:03,676 --> 02:43:07,620
[SPEAKER_10]: There's like a parking, which I don't think is used.

1605
02:43:07,660 --> 02:43:14,067
[SPEAKER_10]: It's walled off right now or fenced off, but it seems tricky.

1606
02:43:15,368 --> 02:43:18,932
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just looking at it in Google Maps here.

1607
02:43:20,274 --> 02:43:21,395
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be from the...

1608
02:43:22,045 --> 02:43:36,748
[SPEAKER_01]: East side of Sycamore directly across Riverside, essentially being a mid block crossing on, you know, in one half and an in section on the other, or even between the two driveways so that the property I think you're referring to on the east side, basically was meant to connect.

1609
02:43:37,469 --> 02:43:43,951
[SPEAKER_01]: folks that want to utilize the transit stops when they're either returning to, you know, coming to work or returning home.

1610
02:43:44,471 --> 02:43:53,013
[SPEAKER_01]: And as Deanna pointed out, this is roughly mid-block, so are people really going to, from Sycamore, travel to Locust or Commercial to press the button across?

1611
02:43:53,053 --> 02:43:59,395
[SPEAKER_01]: They're likely going to just cross there where the transit stop is anyways, so to make that as safe as possible.

1612
02:44:00,575 --> 02:44:03,096
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, Todd, I think we completely agree with you.

1613
02:44:03,136 --> 02:44:17,104
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we're just going to have to work with the Traffic Commission to figure out the appropriate signage to make motorists aware that the mid-block crossing is occurring here and exactly what curb ramps that we want to match up.

1614
02:44:17,224 --> 02:44:27,470
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's something that's worthwhile, especially to further encourage transit use to this location and support safe and direct crossings to those facilities.

1615
02:44:31,020 --> 02:44:34,062
[SPEAKER_01]: The interesting thing is Andre that the team moved the bus stop.

1616
02:44:34,102 --> 02:44:41,906
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to be closer to Locust Street, the one westbound, but they moved it because they needed to get into the left lane at Locust anyway, so.

1617
02:44:45,087 --> 02:44:45,988
[SPEAKER_10]: Right, OK.

1618
02:44:48,269 --> 02:44:55,553
[SPEAKER_10]: So the language, I guess, that's in the Todd Blake's letter is amenable then to the proponent.

1619
02:44:56,153 --> 02:44:57,154
[SPEAKER_10]: We can just go with that.

1620
02:44:59,275 --> 02:44:59,415
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

1621
02:45:00,423 --> 02:45:01,123
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, absolutely.

1622
02:45:06,004 --> 02:45:06,225
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

1623
02:45:07,505 --> 02:45:15,307
[SPEAKER_10]: And any concerns with any of the conditions that Amanda had read off?

1624
02:45:20,208 --> 02:45:26,350
[SPEAKER_16]: I had the facade, the tree wells, I think we addressed in the fact that, I'm not sure, I think that was David's point, right?

1625
02:45:26,390 --> 02:45:26,870
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't think we

1626
02:45:28,643 --> 02:45:30,105
[SPEAKER_16]: We don't have much to put trees there.

1627
02:45:30,145 --> 02:45:31,366
[SPEAKER_16]: Unfortunately, it's not much land there.

1628
02:45:31,446 --> 02:45:33,829
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think that may be something we can't work on David.

1629
02:45:33,849 --> 02:45:35,251
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, we can take that one out.

1630
02:45:35,331 --> 02:45:36,612
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's that's correct.

1631
02:45:36,993 --> 02:45:42,219
[SPEAKER_16]: The tank screening obviously tenant kind of driven porous pavement will will explore it.

1632
02:45:42,299 --> 02:45:42,840
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm not sure.

1633
02:45:43,597 --> 02:45:45,258
[SPEAKER_16]: I think it's more of an exploration, right?

1634
02:45:45,458 --> 02:45:52,684
[SPEAKER_10]: Just to look at the- Yeah, I think that would be the condition to be explore the use of porous pavement on the parking areas.

1635
02:45:53,144 --> 02:45:57,547
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, and the sidewalk along across the loading dock, we agree that that makes sense to do it.

1636
02:45:59,389 --> 02:46:02,491
[SPEAKER_10]: The way you stated- That's street grade, but with concrete.

1637
02:46:02,831 --> 02:46:03,132
[SPEAKER_16]: Correct.

1638
02:46:03,172 --> 02:46:03,392
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1639
02:46:03,412 --> 02:46:03,872
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, that works.

1640
02:46:03,892 --> 02:46:05,673
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's just David's comments.

1641
02:46:05,693 --> 02:46:06,854
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, Todd's comments.

1642
02:46:06,934 --> 02:46:09,817
[SPEAKER_16]: I think, yeah, we're 100% on board with those conditions.

1643
02:46:13,223 --> 02:46:14,543
[SPEAKER_10]: Board members, did we miss anything?

1644
02:46:18,044 --> 02:46:33,628
[SPEAKER_20]: Andre, was there something to the potential shifting the landscaping in the parking lot to perhaps create a landscaping area, and also the idea of the length of the parking spaces along that fence line?

1645
02:46:34,686 --> 02:46:39,529
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I guess my, my, you know, Todd said that we might be able to squeeze three feet out.

1646
02:46:39,849 --> 02:46:50,635
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, for me, it just seemed like a washed and didn't really seem worth doing and shifting, you know, they have a nicely landscaped entrance right now.

1647
02:46:50,735 --> 02:46:54,357
[SPEAKER_10]: Shifting that to the interior didn't seem to add a lot.

1648
02:46:55,558 --> 02:46:55,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

1649
02:46:56,018 --> 02:46:56,858
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't disagree with that.

1650
02:46:56,878 --> 02:47:00,140
[SPEAKER_20]: I just wanted to make sure we hadn't reached some other conclusion on that.

1651
02:47:00,881 --> 02:47:01,041
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1652
02:47:01,081 --> 02:47:01,341
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1653
02:47:05,742 --> 02:47:25,970
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, well, with this list of conditions, and I think we should just have some language in there saying that the chair will work with the community development staff to finalize the wording.

1654
02:47:28,011 --> 02:47:32,853
[SPEAKER_10]: We could accept a motion

1655
02:47:34,165 --> 02:47:44,310
[SPEAKER_10]: to approve the special permit with site plan review, including conditions for this project.

1656
02:47:44,330 --> 02:47:49,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a board member that would like to so move?

1657
02:47:52,414 --> 02:47:54,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Andre, I'll so move that motion.

1658
02:47:54,895 --> 02:47:55,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1659
02:47:55,935 --> 02:47:56,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Deanna.

1660
02:47:56,576 --> 02:47:57,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a second?

1661
02:47:58,316 --> 02:47:59,337
[SPEAKER_20]: I can second, Andre.

1662
02:47:59,357 --> 02:47:59,917
[SPEAKER_20]: It's David.

1663
02:48:01,178 --> 02:48:01,498
[SPEAKER_10]: David?

1664
02:48:02,451 --> 02:48:03,551
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, roll call vote.

1665
02:48:04,551 --> 02:48:05,171
[SPEAKER_10]: Christy Dowd.

1666
02:48:06,212 --> 02:48:06,372
[SPEAKER_06]: Aye.

1667
02:48:07,492 --> 02:48:08,212
[SPEAKER_10]: David Blumberg.

1668
02:48:08,892 --> 02:48:09,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

1669
02:48:09,992 --> 02:48:10,552
[SPEAKER_10]: Anna Peabody.

1670
02:48:11,233 --> 02:48:11,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

1671
02:48:12,193 --> 02:48:13,333
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm an aye as well.

1672
02:48:16,773 --> 02:48:21,334
[SPEAKER_10]: Special permit with site plan review is approved.

1673
02:48:23,835 --> 02:48:24,135
[SPEAKER_15]: Awesome.

1674
02:48:24,795 --> 02:48:25,755
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you so much, everybody.

1675
02:48:25,775 --> 02:48:31,236
[SPEAKER_16]: This has obviously been an enjoyable experience and a good discussion, so I appreciate your

1676
02:48:31,892 --> 02:48:35,914
[SPEAKER_16]: flexibility on a kind of new way of moving through a process.

1677
02:48:35,974 --> 02:48:42,857
[SPEAKER_16]: So we, uh, this isn't the last you see of us, obviously we'll be back hopefully sooner than anybody hopes, um, to see you guys.

1678
02:48:42,877 --> 02:48:43,338
[SPEAKER_16]: So thank you.

1679
02:48:44,078 --> 02:48:44,658
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thank you.

1680
02:48:44,698 --> 02:48:47,359
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really, uh, I think everybody agrees.

1681
02:48:47,380 --> 02:48:48,340
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a great project.

1682
02:48:48,380 --> 02:48:51,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Brings a lot of jobs to the community, different kinds of jobs.

1683
02:48:51,822 --> 02:48:53,302
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're excited about it.

1684
02:48:53,322 --> 02:48:54,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Awesome.

1685
02:48:54,963 --> 02:48:55,183
[SPEAKER_16]: Great.

1686
02:48:55,543 --> 02:48:56,564
[SPEAKER_16]: I hope everybody has a great night.

1687
02:48:57,244 --> 02:48:57,564
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1688
02:48:57,604 --> 02:48:58,185
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1689
02:48:58,205 --> 02:48:59,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much.

1690
02:48:59,946 --> 02:49:00,706
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you guys.

1691
02:49:01,282 --> 02:49:02,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, good night.

1692
02:49:02,223 --> 02:49:02,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1693
02:49:02,703 --> 02:49:14,032
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so CD board members, we're not quite done, but since we only have four of us, I'm going to suggest we continue the discussion of the rules and regulations one more time.

1694
02:49:14,052 --> 02:49:17,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's fair.

1695
02:49:17,754 --> 02:49:19,836
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I feel like more of us need to be here.

1696
02:49:21,397 --> 02:49:23,198
[SPEAKER_10]: Christy, would you make that motion?

1697
02:49:23,218 --> 02:49:27,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I will make that motion to continue.

1698
02:49:29,549 --> 02:49:32,932
[SPEAKER_06]: until we have more board members at the next meeting to review the rules and ranks.

1699
02:49:33,973 --> 02:49:35,113
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

1700
02:49:35,594 --> 02:49:36,454
[SPEAKER_20]: I'd like to second that.

1701
02:49:38,556 --> 02:49:39,276
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call vote.

1702
02:49:39,376 --> 02:49:39,997
[SPEAKER_10]: Christy down.

1703
02:49:41,658 --> 02:49:42,339
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.

1704
02:49:43,259 --> 02:49:43,920
[SPEAKER_10]: David Blumberg.

1705
02:49:44,620 --> 02:49:44,840
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

1706
02:49:46,341 --> 02:49:46,702
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

1707
02:49:47,482 --> 02:49:49,984
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm an eye as well.

1708
02:49:50,084 --> 02:49:50,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1709
02:49:50,504 --> 02:49:52,045
[SPEAKER_10]: That's unanimously continued.

1710
02:49:52,066 --> 02:49:58,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have a date yet for the next meeting?

1711
02:50:01,858 --> 02:50:02,939
[SPEAKER_09]: And I might have a couple.

1712
02:50:02,959 --> 02:50:06,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the next?

1713
02:50:06,100 --> 02:50:06,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1714
02:50:07,561 --> 02:50:11,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Under miscellaneous and other updates, that's one of the bullet items there.

1715
02:50:12,584 --> 02:50:12,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1716
02:50:13,084 --> 02:50:21,229
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, before we get to that, I wanted to give a brief update about a previous filing that had come in, because it kind of ties into our scheduling.

1717
02:50:21,909 --> 02:50:24,090
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me just pull up my notes here.

1718
02:50:24,110 --> 02:50:25,691
[SPEAKER_04]: But 200 Boston Avenue.

1719
02:50:30,321 --> 02:50:33,944
[SPEAKER_04]: is reconsidering a bit their project.

1720
02:50:35,125 --> 02:50:46,754
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've spoken with staff here, and we've consulted with the building commissioner in kind of figuring out what the process ought to be moving forward.

1721
02:50:47,795 --> 02:50:51,998
[SPEAKER_04]: But they are, yeah, I think reimagining a slightly smaller project.

1722
02:50:54,900 --> 02:51:02,288
[SPEAKER_04]: And had kind of heard what the board had been saying about some of their concerns as well as I think a change in circumstances with a potential tenant.

1723
02:51:03,610 --> 02:51:08,335
[SPEAKER_04]: So just wanted to give you a heads up that that will be coming before you, excuse me.

1724
02:51:10,157 --> 02:51:13,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Another time, and it will be kind of reconceived as a new project.

1725
02:51:15,943 --> 02:51:20,746
[SPEAKER_04]: it won't need to be going, or sorry, it will be still going to the ZBA.

1726
02:51:21,867 --> 02:51:35,736
[SPEAKER_04]: So the board here will be in charge of putting forth some recommendations or even just continuing the existing recommendations that were already kind of discussed.

1727
02:51:36,937 --> 02:51:40,619
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be a slightly expedited process from normal, and

1728
02:51:43,968 --> 02:52:00,067
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I want to make sure that, and this, this is why it ties into some of the scheduling, if we talk about September, kind of just want to make sure that we're not overloading the agenda, and also kind of getting things within a certain timeframe.

1729
02:52:03,678 --> 02:52:14,921
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, and I guess maybe I would just invite Victor, if there's anything else you felt like might be relevant to share about the nature of the changes for this project.

1730
02:52:15,261 --> 02:52:19,462
[SPEAKER_10]: Amanda, just to be clear, we would still have to do a public hearing, right?

1731
02:52:21,442 --> 02:52:24,643
[SPEAKER_04]: It would be a public meeting, yes.

1732
02:52:25,243 --> 02:52:27,024
[SPEAKER_04]: So we would still have to do a public meeting.

1733
02:52:28,184 --> 02:52:31,165
[SPEAKER_04]: We would still put out a courtesy notice to abutters.

1734
02:52:32,970 --> 02:52:51,662
[SPEAKER_04]: much of the process is kind of the same as before, with like a little bit of time shaved off for review, because the project itself is kind of similar in conception to what was already put before the board, but less of an impact.

1735
02:52:51,942 --> 02:53:01,228
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of the materials still provide like updated plans, and then kind of a memo detailing changes with traffic or parking.

1736
02:53:03,171 --> 02:53:05,372
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, that's a great summary, Amanda.

1737
02:53:05,652 --> 02:53:09,355
[SPEAKER_17]: Andre, the process actually wouldn't change.

1738
02:53:09,415 --> 02:53:10,195
[SPEAKER_17]: We don't expect.

1739
02:53:10,235 --> 02:53:14,457
[SPEAKER_17]: We are asking Cummings to refile with the building commissioner.

1740
02:53:14,497 --> 02:53:21,882
[SPEAKER_17]: He'll issue a new permit refusal, but we don't anticipate a change in the steps.

1741
02:53:23,042 --> 02:53:28,465
[SPEAKER_17]: So it would come to you for a recommendation and then move on to ZBA, which would be the special permit.

1742
02:53:29,906 --> 02:53:32,648
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a significantly smaller project is my understanding.

1743
02:53:33,279 --> 02:53:34,279
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it is.

1744
02:53:34,359 --> 02:53:40,522
[SPEAKER_17]: It looks similar to the original design.

1745
02:53:40,762 --> 02:53:46,024
[SPEAKER_17]: Smaller garage, smaller gross leaseable, and smaller retail.

1746
02:53:46,064 --> 02:53:46,724
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's

1747
02:53:49,127 --> 02:53:56,130
[SPEAKER_17]: We do want them to update some of the material, obviously present a new package to you all so that you can have your input.

1748
02:53:57,151 --> 02:54:17,840
[SPEAKER_17]: But as Amanda said, because it's not dramatically different, we don't expect the need for the typical kind of time frame around internal staff review, because everyone's looked at it recently, and it shouldn't

1749
02:54:19,770 --> 02:54:23,192
[SPEAKER_17]: shouldn't require a whole lot of time and attention to move it forward.

1750
02:54:23,252 --> 02:54:29,515
[SPEAKER_17]: So if we can expedite it, then we'll follow the normal process.

1751
02:54:29,555 --> 02:54:33,397
[SPEAKER_17]: But we are trying to work with them to move it along if we can.

1752
02:54:38,440 --> 02:54:40,741
[SPEAKER_10]: So Amanda, in terms of the scheduling,

1753
02:54:41,781 --> 02:54:55,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so with that in mind, I kind of wanted to just ask the board what their thoughts were on, so there are, as I know, of two filings that could or should be happening in September for review.

1754
02:54:55,929 --> 02:55:05,495
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't sure if we wanted to include both of them in one meeting or if it would make sense to split those up into separate meetings within September.

1755
02:55:06,555 --> 02:55:15,581
[SPEAKER_04]: But two dates that I wanted to float by y'all were September 15th and September 22nd.

1756
02:55:23,226 --> 02:55:29,410
[SPEAKER_17]: And the other filing is 16 Foster Court, which has come in with their formal proposal.

1757
02:55:33,969 --> 02:55:35,369
[SPEAKER_10]: How many units is that?

1758
02:55:37,250 --> 02:55:38,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Nine, eight.

1759
02:55:40,311 --> 02:55:43,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Have they changed their plans much?

1760
02:55:44,993 --> 02:55:45,673
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, they have.

1761
02:55:45,733 --> 02:55:56,336
[SPEAKER_17]: They they definitely incorporated the many of the recommendations that came out of the last, the preview meeting with the board.

1762
02:55:56,356 --> 02:55:59,177
[SPEAKER_17]: Um is it dramatically changed?

1763
02:55:59,217 --> 02:55:59,397
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1764
02:55:59,798 --> 02:56:01,518
[SPEAKER_17]: But certainly, you

1765
02:56:09,302 --> 02:56:10,663
[SPEAKER_10]: I could do either one, Amanda.

1766
02:56:11,023 --> 02:56:13,205
[SPEAKER_10]: 15th is a little bit of a preference for me.

1767
02:56:14,466 --> 02:56:17,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any thought to doing two separate meetings?

1768
02:56:18,789 --> 02:56:23,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do we think that both of those will be short enough to have them in one meeting together that it's fine?

1769
02:56:24,013 --> 02:56:26,055
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to be explicit about it.

1770
02:56:26,936 --> 02:56:31,719
[SPEAKER_02]: And at this point, it's too late that we wouldn't add anything else to the agenda.

1771
02:56:32,440 --> 02:56:34,682
[SPEAKER_02]: And if there was anything big coming in, we'd know about it.

1772
02:56:34,742 --> 02:56:38,685
[SPEAKER_02]: We could get an A&R or something that could slip in.

1773
02:56:41,635 --> 02:56:47,196
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I feel like we're not going to be changing our conditions much for the Cummings one.

1774
02:56:47,736 --> 02:56:53,438
[SPEAKER_10]: The Foster Court could be a longer conversation, but we have seen it before, so there's that advantage.

1775
02:56:54,758 --> 02:57:05,121
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't mind doing both of them together, because I don't think the Cummings one is going to be going to take a long time.

1776
02:57:05,341 --> 02:57:07,161
[SPEAKER_10]: Board members, it's your pleasure.

1777
02:57:07,181 --> 02:57:11,262
[SPEAKER_09]: That works for me, doing both on the same.

1778
02:57:18,158 --> 02:57:18,898
[SPEAKER_20]: Sounds good to me, too.

1779
02:57:19,458 --> 02:57:20,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, same.

1780
02:57:21,719 --> 02:57:24,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Would the 15th be amenable to you all?

1781
02:57:27,321 --> 02:57:27,521
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1782
02:57:34,944 --> 02:57:35,864
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that looks fine.

1783
02:57:39,186 --> 02:57:39,486
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

1784
02:57:41,947 --> 02:57:42,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

1785
02:57:44,243 --> 02:57:53,773
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, maybe I'll just, we'll say that works, and I'll confirm with other board members who aren't present, but we'll say the 15th.

1786
02:57:53,793 --> 02:58:02,302
[SPEAKER_10]: I finished before by nine, so Alicia, you have 60 seconds for any updates.

1787
02:58:03,225 --> 02:58:14,612
[SPEAKER_02]: The have two things on one was the what you just said, so the other update was I just wanted to sorry I wrote this down and now it's on the other screen.

1788
02:58:15,429 --> 02:58:16,150
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.

1789
02:58:16,210 --> 02:58:18,151
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the climate adaptation plan.

1790
02:58:18,211 --> 02:58:18,671
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that right?

1791
02:58:18,871 --> 02:58:19,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1792
02:58:20,292 --> 02:58:24,455
[SPEAKER_02]: You have the, you have our notes open and I can't get that window.

1793
02:58:24,475 --> 02:58:25,636
[SPEAKER_02]: Two screens here.

1794
02:58:26,337 --> 02:58:35,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so we sent around some of them, my staff working on the climate plan, sent around the draft strategies, the community development board members.

1795
02:58:36,003 --> 02:58:37,724
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is basically it's in preview mode.

1796
02:58:38,105 --> 02:58:42,588
[SPEAKER_02]: And if any of you want to put the mid comments or feedback on them,

1797
02:58:43,471 --> 02:58:50,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, before it goes public, if you want to submit stuff within the next week, we can do that.

1798
02:58:50,918 --> 02:58:52,339
[SPEAKER_02]: We're happy to get that input.

1799
02:58:53,380 --> 02:58:56,223
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't feel that this is your only input chance.

1800
02:58:56,623 --> 02:59:06,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, the process is that in early September, we're going to release a full draft Climate Action and Adaptation Plan with all the strategies

1801
02:59:07,212 --> 02:59:09,993
[SPEAKER_02]: and actions in it and take public comment.

1802
02:59:10,394 --> 02:59:13,435
[SPEAKER_02]: And we expect to be open for public comment for at least two months.

1803
02:59:14,736 --> 02:59:18,417
[SPEAKER_02]: So there'll be plenty of time to review it and to provide feedback.

1804
02:59:19,238 --> 02:59:36,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been particularly asking departments such as Tim's and Todd's that have very direct connections to it to look at strategies before we go public so that we're not publishing anything that they then have serious concerns with.

1805
02:59:37,285 --> 02:59:42,147
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if any members, we didn't hear anything back from the DEVELOP planning board.

1806
02:59:42,167 --> 02:59:51,692
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just sort of wanted to mention that, that if you want to review it, if you want to provide input before we go public, this is the chance.

1807
02:59:53,172 --> 02:59:53,752
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks, Alicia.

1808
02:59:53,873 --> 02:59:54,533
[SPEAKER_10]: Appreciate that.

1809
02:59:54,633 --> 03:00:05,758
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe, you know, Amanda, you could just send out an email reminder to the board, especially since we're missing members.

1810
03:00:06,642 --> 03:00:07,482
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I am.

1811
03:00:07,502 --> 03:00:11,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Amanda, if you help me remember, I'll look in my email.

1812
03:00:11,903 --> 03:00:23,006
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have, I was copied on all the messages, so I should actually have the message that went to the board about this, that I can resend it to everybody, sort of reminding you all.

1813
03:00:24,386 --> 03:00:30,187
[SPEAKER_02]: When we met today on the plan, I said I'd mention it to you guys tonight, in case anybody wanted to do that.

1814
03:00:30,207 --> 03:00:33,288
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you.

1815
03:00:35,455 --> 03:00:37,136
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, thanks, everybody.

1816
03:00:37,156 --> 03:00:40,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have a... Go ahead, David.

1817
03:00:40,378 --> 03:00:41,879
[SPEAKER_20]: No questions.

1818
03:00:42,079 --> 03:00:47,162
[SPEAKER_20]: Any updates on our seventh member and terms and that sort of stuff to share?

1819
03:00:47,643 --> 03:00:57,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I discussed... I sent the mayor some information, discussed with her briefly the membership in July, and then I went on a two-week vacation.

1820
03:00:58,149 --> 03:01:00,390
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have not... I've been back since Monday.

1821
03:01:00,450 --> 03:01:04,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't had a chance to follow up with her, and she didn't act on it while I was away.

1822
03:01:05,205 --> 03:01:09,008
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why it seems like nothing has happened.

1823
03:01:09,029 --> 03:01:12,031
[SPEAKER_10]: It's also August.

1824
03:01:12,291 --> 03:01:13,012
[SPEAKER_10]: Things slow down.

1825
03:01:13,833 --> 03:01:14,153
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

1826
03:01:14,213 --> 03:01:15,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're working.

1827
03:01:15,054 --> 03:01:15,815
[SPEAKER_02]: I apologize.

1828
03:01:15,835 --> 03:01:17,316
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also working on hiring.

1829
03:01:17,777 --> 03:01:22,481
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of new positions were approved in the city budget.

1830
03:01:25,081 --> 03:01:29,084
[SPEAKER_02]: There is churn going on in the municipal employment world.

1831
03:01:29,824 --> 03:01:46,854
[SPEAKER_02]: This may be happening in all fields everywhere, but the number of openings and people leaving municipalities to go to other municipalities, like we just left the city engineer to Cambridge, not Tim, but like one of his staff.

1832
03:01:47,595 --> 03:01:53,118
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're kind of a bit overwhelmed by the churn that's occurring with staff.

1833
03:01:57,474 --> 03:02:00,776
[SPEAKER_20]: My other question is on the progress on zoning.

1834
03:02:01,496 --> 03:02:02,837
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been trying to keep up with it.

1835
03:02:03,357 --> 03:02:12,142
[SPEAKER_20]: The last viewing I did was, I believe, from the July 24th meeting with Mark Mabrowski, and obviously, Alicia, you were contributing at that.

1836
03:02:13,402 --> 03:02:16,284
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if there was one subsequent to that, if you can remember and let me know,

1837
03:02:18,058 --> 03:02:34,413
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm feeling already a little bit of stress and a little sweat about what this is going to look like when it comes back to us, because I keep hearing the city council talking about how they're relying on us to air this thing out and provide feedback.

1838
03:02:35,133 --> 03:02:39,858
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know how much time we're going to have to deal with it, and that's what gets me a little nervous.

1839
03:02:44,143 --> 03:02:47,825
[SPEAKER_02]: And you said it was the July meetings, the one that you remember that.

1840
03:02:48,045 --> 03:02:56,110
[SPEAKER_20]: 24th is, that's the date that I recall being, this is like the last one that I could find on demand, so to speak.

1841
03:02:56,970 --> 03:02:59,452
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just checking my notes.

1842
03:02:59,732 --> 03:03:05,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we got an update in June and they met on it in July.

1843
03:03:05,415 --> 03:03:09,538
[SPEAKER_20]: This one went over wireless and it went over the definition of family.

1844
03:03:09,558 --> 03:03:11,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the last meeting that they held.

1845
03:03:13,850 --> 03:03:15,831
[SPEAKER_20]: Victor spoke about O2 at the same time.

1846
03:03:16,531 --> 03:03:19,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they have not notified me of another meeting.

1847
03:03:20,313 --> 03:03:20,554
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

1848
03:03:21,814 --> 03:03:30,059
[SPEAKER_20]: It seems like Mark is always pushing to get a draft turned around, but they don't always come back with a meeting that's as prompt as perhaps his turnaround is.

1849
03:03:31,019 --> 03:03:31,319
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1850
03:03:33,100 --> 03:03:38,563
[SPEAKER_20]: But you don't have a sense of when that's going to come to us or how long will we be allowed to kind of deal with it?

1851
03:03:39,578 --> 03:03:48,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so I would look at it this way with if they were first zoning to us, we have a short window of time to open a public hearing.

1852
03:03:49,485 --> 03:03:52,967
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's nothing that says when we have to close the public hearing.

1853
03:03:53,708 --> 03:03:58,071
[SPEAKER_02]: They also have to open a public hearing in sort of that same amount of time.

1854
03:03:58,131 --> 03:04:00,613
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very odd work in the law.

1855
03:04:02,403 --> 03:04:06,929
[SPEAKER_02]: But they obviously can't do anything until they hear back from us.

1856
03:04:07,570 --> 03:04:15,180
[SPEAKER_02]: My expectation is that if we have a couple of public hearings, we continue it, that would be

1857
03:04:16,303 --> 03:04:17,444
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm anticipating that.

1858
03:04:17,644 --> 03:04:21,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't imagine, you know, they have 15 meetings on this.

1859
03:04:21,285 --> 03:04:24,807
[SPEAKER_02]: We obviously can't have one public hearing in one night and that's it.

1860
03:04:25,287 --> 03:04:26,828
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll open a public hearing.

1861
03:04:26,968 --> 03:04:36,373
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have a short window to open the public hearing, but then I anticipate we would meet multiple times on it.

1862
03:04:37,353 --> 03:04:38,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't see any other way.

1863
03:04:38,894 --> 03:04:40,014
[SPEAKER_02]: It's massive.

1864
03:04:46,656 --> 03:04:47,457
[SPEAKER_10]: Anything else.

1865
03:04:48,298 --> 03:04:58,607
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just add that I assume that everybody has pays attention to the news and that with the evolution of this pandemic.

1866
03:04:59,107 --> 03:05:02,711
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not talking about in person meetings anytime soon.

1867
03:05:03,539 --> 03:05:24,590
[SPEAKER_02]: And if anybody, if a member of the committee feels that we should be meeting in person, there are members of the public who feel that they want us to adjust how we're doing business, it would be helpful for us to hear that directly in this office, because we have not gotten any feedback from anybody saying we wish the Community Development Board meetings were in person.

1868
03:05:25,970 --> 03:05:28,512
[SPEAKER_02]: If that changes, we'll discuss it.

1869
03:05:29,991 --> 03:05:36,754
[SPEAKER_02]: But with the numbers going back up, we are not talking about holding in-person meetings.

1870
03:05:36,814 --> 03:05:43,758
[SPEAKER_10]: I think virtual meetings actually work well for this board, especially given the presentations and the ability of people to hear and see the proponents.

1871
03:05:46,319 --> 03:05:55,203
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's been another long evening, so I'm going to entertain a motion to adjourn, if someone would like to make that motion.

1872
03:05:55,803 --> 03:05:59,165
[SPEAKER_20]: Andre, David, I'd like to make a motion to adjourn tonight's meeting.

1873
03:06:00,362 --> 03:06:01,043
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a second?

1874
03:06:02,305 --> 03:06:02,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'll second.

1875
03:06:05,189 --> 03:06:05,870
[SPEAKER_10]: Roll call vote.

1876
03:06:05,950 --> 03:06:06,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Christy Dowd?
