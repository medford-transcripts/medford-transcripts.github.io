00:00:58,583 --> 00:00:59,083
[SPEAKER_08]: That is correct.

15
00:00:59,123 --> 00:00:59,323

[SPEAKER_08]: And we have a representative for the applicant.

20
00:01:28,895 --> 00:01:30,516
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm representing myself.

[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

22
00:01:33,319 --> 00:01:35,060
[SPEAKER_08]: If you could give your name and address for the record.

23
00:01:36,041 --> 00:01:37,282
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Lubna Kiadi.

24
00:01:38,202 --> 00:01:40,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Address is 39 Taft Street in Medford.

25
00:01:43,386 --> 00:01:43,727
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

26
00:01:44,487 --> 00:01:44,928
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

27
00:01:46,289 --> 00:01:47,970
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you could go ahead with your presentation.

28
00:01:50,051 --> 00:01:56,637
[SPEAKER_03]: So the house is currently, when we purchased the house, it was two bedrooms.

29
00:01:59,204 --> 00:02:00,325
[SPEAKER_03]: a single family house.

30
00:02:02,006 --> 00:02:05,609
[SPEAKER_03]: I have three kids, my mom living with me.

31
00:02:06,770 --> 00:02:18,399
[SPEAKER_03]: So we need to expand the size of the room to at least four bedrooms so we can all have a privacy, kids can have privacy, me, my mom, my husband.

32
00:02:20,552 --> 00:02:40,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking forward to extend the size of the family and one of the bedrooms, which puts me in a situation that I'm not meet the requirements for the street and the border with my neighbor.

33
00:02:40,989 --> 00:02:44,152
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not too much that I need to expand, it's only,

34
00:02:49,707 --> 00:02:52,769
[SPEAKER_03]: The size is like 8 inches or 8 feet.

35
00:02:56,813 --> 00:03:01,777
[SPEAKER_03]: So currently my son is having asthma from sleeping in the basement.

36
00:03:03,138 --> 00:03:05,380
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's getting worse.

37
00:03:06,641 --> 00:03:08,903
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to...

38
00:03:12,385 --> 00:03:16,527
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're in a situation that we have to add another second floor.

39
00:03:16,627 --> 00:03:21,730
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not optional right now.

40
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:22,370
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.

41
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:26,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to display any content?

42
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:30,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to have Dennis share any of the files that you sent over?

43
00:03:34,236 --> 00:03:35,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have to?

44
00:03:36,297 --> 00:03:36,837
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I can do it.

45
00:03:36,857 --> 00:03:40,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I can show the map, sort of the plan that sort of shows the house if you want.

46
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:42,480
[SPEAKER_05]: So everyone can sort of visually see it.

47
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me do that right now.

48
00:03:44,762 --> 00:03:46,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the lab plan would be the best item.

49
00:03:48,764 --> 00:03:59,010
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, is everyone seeing this?

50
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:02,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

51
00:04:02,457 --> 00:04:02,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

52
00:04:02,757 --> 00:04:05,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me just zoom in a little bit.

53
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:08,880
[SPEAKER_04]: That's too much, I think.

54
00:04:10,521 --> 00:04:10,701
Yeah.

55
00:04:12,662 --> 00:04:12,983
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

56
00:04:13,743 --> 00:04:14,123
[SPEAKER_07]: No worries.

57
00:04:14,823 --> 00:04:15,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

58
00:04:22,967 --> 00:04:29,691
[SPEAKER_05]: Where my arrow is, this is the corner of the house that's adding on that's requiring the

59
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:34,841
[SPEAKER_05]: the zoning position.

60
00:04:36,622 --> 00:04:37,222
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

61
00:04:37,262 --> 00:04:41,965
[SPEAKER_03]: The red line, that's where we need to expand from the side.

62
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:45,828
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like two feet on six.

63
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:52,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Then seven feet coming forward to the street.

64
00:04:55,734 --> 00:04:58,976
[SPEAKER_03]: That has already existed, the one in front.

65
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:03,832
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not changing the measurements.

66
00:05:05,393 --> 00:05:07,194
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just extending the wall.

67
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:13,338
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

68
00:05:13,638 --> 00:05:14,699
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

69
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:16,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions from the board?

70
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:27,507
[SPEAKER_07]: Commissioner?

71
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:38,296
[SPEAKER_09]: I do want to clarify the front setback, both corners come into play here as encroachments on the front setback.

72
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:46,958
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're both, you're looking at both the two as a finding or a special permit for finding for an extension of non-conformity on both corners.

73
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:48,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

74
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:49,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for the correction.

75
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,320
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the one corner for the side yard setback and then both corners for the front.

76
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, both sides.

77
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:55,601
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

78
00:05:55,841 --> 00:05:56,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

79
00:06:12,453 --> 00:06:13,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Any questions from the board?

80
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:15,857
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just throw that out there one more time.

81
00:06:22,602 --> 00:06:35,367
[SPEAKER_08]: And just a clarification for me to everyone, the, the original filing in the note was that this was a request for variance, but the commissioner did just qualify and we did discuss that.

82
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:38,828
[SPEAKER_08]: This is will be a special permit, not a variance.

83
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:40,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

84
00:06:46,318 --> 00:06:52,941
[SPEAKER_03]: The size of the room, it won't be in a good size room and a good size living room to extend the sides.

85
00:06:53,241 --> 00:07:00,104
[SPEAKER_03]: And the rooms will be in a weird shape if it's not extended from both sides.

86
00:07:00,124 --> 00:07:00,924
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

87
00:07:11,527 --> 00:07:14,869
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Chris, go ahead.

88
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:31,678
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, I just have a, you know, sort of a question about whether or not that area in the front of the house, since we don't have an elevation or photo, was that originally a porch?

89
00:07:32,298 --> 00:07:34,900
[SPEAKER_06]: And is it an enclosed porch?

90
00:07:35,740 --> 00:07:36,641
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a closed porch.

91
00:07:37,121 --> 00:07:38,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so I don't know if that

92
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:54,098
[SPEAKER_06]: that doesn't factor into our discussions tonight, I guess, if building commissioner feels that's... So we don't have the thing that we don't have that like a sidewalk in the street.

93
00:07:54,218 --> 00:08:02,104
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is a lot of houses in our street that they have that wall like that close to the streets.

94
00:08:02,364 --> 00:08:05,427
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, that's how the streets as we don't have

95
00:08:06,867 --> 00:08:10,948
[SPEAKER_03]: like a sidewalk and like their houses, they're already built like that.

96
00:08:12,088 --> 00:08:13,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, how are you guys?

97
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:15,289
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm Briss.

98
00:08:16,269 --> 00:08:22,150
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to just explain to you that the front is like, it's called like a sun room.

99
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:23,830
[SPEAKER_02]: It already exists.

100
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,771
[SPEAKER_02]: We will not add anything in the front.

101
00:08:26,751 --> 00:08:28,371
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's already sun room.

102
00:08:30,692 --> 00:08:32,092
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fully enclosed already.

103
00:08:32,848 --> 00:08:40,690
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to only add the sides, like two feet and a half on the right and two feet on the right, on the left.

104
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:47,352
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I understood what the proposal is.

105
00:08:47,432 --> 00:08:48,473
[SPEAKER_06]: I just didn't know.

106
00:08:48,993 --> 00:08:59,576
[SPEAKER_06]: Perhaps, Mr. Chair, through you, to the building commissioner, is there any factor other than the type of construction that's done on that?

107
00:09:01,944 --> 00:09:09,106
[SPEAKER_06]: proposed extension that would differ from it being a different portion of the house?

108
00:09:10,686 --> 00:09:12,186
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter from our perspective.

109
00:09:12,226 --> 00:09:13,887
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just the setback that we're looking at.

110
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:20,828
[SPEAKER_09]: It's considered part of the structure, part of the footprint being fully enclosed.

111
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:24,069
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't really have any bearing per se.

112
00:09:25,969 --> 00:09:26,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

113
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:27,589
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I was curious about.

114
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:27,950
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

115
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:29,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Chris.

116
00:09:31,365 --> 00:09:34,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions from the board before we open public comment?

117
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:42,132
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one question.

118
00:09:42,392 --> 00:09:47,516
[SPEAKER_00]: That addition, that's from the top through the bottom, right?

119
00:09:47,576 --> 00:09:50,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're adding that bit for the second floor?

120
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:51,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

121
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:54,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're adding that in the second floor too.

122
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,701
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

123
00:09:57,442 --> 00:09:57,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

124
00:09:58,543 --> 00:09:58,963
[SPEAKER_03]: You're welcome.

125
00:10:02,063 --> 00:10:02,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

126
00:10:02,423 --> 00:10:15,847
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we'll open to public comment for anyone that is in the meeting that would like to comment, please raise your hand on zoom or on the screen.

127
00:10:16,947 --> 00:10:25,189
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you want, you can also send an email to Dennis at the city and D and McDougall.

128
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:30,542
[SPEAKER_08]: at medford.ma.gov.

129
00:10:31,283 --> 00:10:32,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dennis.

130
00:10:32,123 --> 00:10:32,944
[SPEAKER_08]: That's now in the chat.

131
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:44,593
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just give that a minute.

132
00:10:46,015 --> 00:10:50,678
[SPEAKER_08]: And Dennis, we didn't receive any letters from the public prior to the meeting, correct, from our vendors?

133
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:55,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, you're on mute.

134
00:10:57,704 --> 00:11:05,353
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, your letters for the board, there were some letters with questions about the project, but nothing that would be that were that was asked to submit to the board.

135
00:11:07,616 --> 00:11:07,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

136
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:13,162
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see any hands raised in zoom.

137
00:11:13,202 --> 00:11:15,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any other anything else in email Dennis?

138
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:27,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, you're back on mute.

139
00:11:27,867 --> 00:11:28,367
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I do not.

140
00:11:29,028 --> 00:11:29,388
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

141
00:11:30,609 --> 00:11:31,650
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

142
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:34,992
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair awaits a motion to enter deliberation.

143
00:11:36,593 --> 00:11:38,695
[SPEAKER_08]: To close the public comment and enter deliberation.

144
00:11:41,877 --> 00:11:44,459
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to know the decision today?

145
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,422
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep, the board's going to discuss it now.

146
00:11:47,962 --> 00:11:48,723
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, thank you.

147
00:11:51,064 --> 00:11:51,765
[SPEAKER_06]: I second that motion.

148
00:11:54,085 --> 00:11:55,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody needs to make it first.

149
00:11:55,865 --> 00:11:56,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I thought you made it.

150
00:11:57,086 --> 00:11:57,626
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't make it.

151
00:11:58,046 --> 00:12:00,406
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, yeah.

152
00:12:00,446 --> 00:12:05,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Make the motion to close public comment.

153
00:12:05,467 --> 00:12:06,328

154
00:12:06,548 --> 00:12:06,988
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, guys.

00:12:07,068 --> 00:12:07,888
[SPEAKER_08]: And enter deliberation.

156
00:12:09,568 --> 00:12:09,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Roll call.

157
00:12:10,969 --> 00:12:11,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Yvette?

158
00:12:14,649 --> 00:12:14,789
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

159
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:15,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Jim?

160
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:16,970
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

161
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:18,490
[SPEAKER_08]: Chris?

162
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:19,711
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

163
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:21,831
[SPEAKER_08]: And Andre?

164
00:12:23,838 --> 00:12:23,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Aye.

165
00:12:24,998 --> 00:12:25,618
[SPEAKER_08]: And Jamie, aye.

166
00:12:25,638 --> 00:12:50,644
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, from a deliberation perspective, again, this is for a special permit, not a variance, so we're going to be looking at circumstances relating to soil condition, shape, topography of the land or structures, where a literal enforcement of provisions of the ordinance or bylaw would involve a substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the petitioner.

167
00:12:51,834 --> 00:13:01,157
[SPEAKER_08]: and that desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of the ordinance or bylaw.

168
00:13:03,577 --> 00:13:07,419
[SPEAKER_08]: So, this is for the board's discussion.

169
00:13:07,779 --> 00:13:08,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

170
00:13:15,441 --> 00:13:16,521
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

171
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything for discussion from the board?

172
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:33,892
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamie this is Andre you know, I think this seems reasonable to me, I think we want to.

173
00:13:35,713 --> 00:13:51,477
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't exacerbate any you know any detrimental impact I think on on the neighborhood and it would seems like it's something that that we could do it's a modest modest ask and modest give.

174
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

175
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:02,205
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

176
00:14:02,365 --> 00:14:03,706
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry.

177
00:14:03,826 --> 00:14:30,403
[SPEAKER_06]: Similarly to Andre, I didn't really have any issues with it, especially if, you know, if, as Dennis says, there are no objections from the abutters and would only be the immediate abutters, I imagine, that would be, you know, interested or affected by such a change.

178
00:14:30,463 --> 00:14:31,204
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's pretty minimal.

179
00:14:34,227 --> 00:14:34,627
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

180
00:14:37,249 --> 00:14:37,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Chris.

181
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:40,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'm in agreement.

182
00:14:41,231 --> 00:14:44,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously we're looking at the extension of a pre existing condition.

183
00:14:45,313 --> 00:14:47,214
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no increase to that either.

184
00:14:49,255 --> 00:14:59,280
[SPEAKER_08]: So I definitely see the need for the family with regards to the improvements to the property and the fact that it does not extend.

185
00:14:59,761 --> 00:15:01,902
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an extension, not an increase.

186
00:15:03,308 --> 00:15:04,609
[SPEAKER_08]: to the nonconformity.

187
00:15:07,089 --> 00:15:18,994
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't see any negative impact to the area, for the neighborhood.

188
00:15:20,414 --> 00:15:28,937
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously from a construction perspective, with regards to the position of the property, there's not much else they can do with what they're planning to move forward with.

189
00:15:33,723 --> 00:15:36,104
[SPEAKER_07]: I also agree with everything that's been said.

190
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:38,944
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Jim.

191
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:43,925
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

192
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair awaits a motion.

193
00:15:54,908 --> 00:15:58,209
[SPEAKER_01]: A motion to approve the special permit for 39 Taft Street.

194
00:15:58,249 --> 00:15:58,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Seconded.

195
00:16:04,137 --> 00:16:08,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you and thank you Chris Roco Andre.

196
00:16:10,201 --> 00:16:14,224
[SPEAKER_08]: I. Chris I event.

197
00:16:16,106 --> 00:16:29,876
[SPEAKER_08]: I Jim I and Jamie I. You have so we've got an approval for the special permit.

198
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:39,256
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have an attorney on your side, Dennis will work on putting that decision together.

199
00:16:40,397 --> 00:16:41,799
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Luna, I'll write the decision.

200
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:44,582
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll try and get it in and get it signed as quickly as possible.

201
00:16:45,222 --> 00:16:46,724
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna get both.

202
00:16:47,352 --> 00:16:51,294
[SPEAKER_05]: After we do it, it's going to get checked by our legal counsel, which is usually a pretty quick turnaround.

203
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:55,075
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the board members will sign that, and then it gets filed in the clerk's office.

204
00:16:55,496 --> 00:17:00,138
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after that, there's a three-week waiting period before you can actually get your permit.

205
00:17:00,198 --> 00:17:05,700
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can go into the building department and sort of talk about steps you need to do to get that building permit in the interim.

206
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:09,282
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can't actually get the final permit until all that time has passed.

207
00:17:09,322 --> 00:17:13,944
[SPEAKER_05]: So it'll take a little bit of time, but we'll try to get this through as quickly as possible for you.

208
00:17:13,964 --> 00:17:14,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

209
00:17:14,764 --> 00:17:16,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, guys, for your time.

210
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:19,130
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

211
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand it.

212
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:29,173
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I believe that so that is our only case for today.

213
00:17:29,193 --> 00:17:48,298
[SPEAKER_05]: So the only administrative... A couple other things, so yeah, so we do have the meeting minutes, not from the August meeting, but from the July meeting that I sent to you after the last meeting for approval, if we, you know, if folks reviewed them or not, but we can get a vote on that.

214
00:17:53,418 --> 00:17:59,001
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the did everybody have an opportunity to review those minutes.

215
00:18:09,164 --> 00:18:12,205
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can just do it at the next meeting, that's easier.

216
00:18:17,327 --> 00:18:19,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if we could do it at the next meeting, that would be great.

217
00:18:20,308 --> 00:18:21,289
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, yeah, thank you.

218
00:18:21,409 --> 00:18:28,491
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we can table that and then the other thing, which we need to discuss is a couple of things is basically scheduling for the basically the next.

219
00:18:29,232 --> 00:18:35,954
[SPEAKER_05]: We can do at least next month, but just as sort of a. Heads up that, you know, October meeting is Halloween.

220
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,476
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't really see having a meeting on Halloween.

221
00:18:40,016 --> 00:18:42,077
[SPEAKER_05]: The November meeting is Thanksgiving.

222
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,938
[SPEAKER_05]: And the December meeting is the day after Christmas.

223
00:18:46,319 --> 00:18:46,479
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

224
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:54,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I would like to sort of at least, at the very bare minimum, get a date for the October meeting.

225
00:18:54,729 --> 00:18:58,370
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully, you know, I think we can sort of discuss the other ones as well.

226
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:03,551
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got five of us here, so I think we can... Isn't that called a trifecta or something?

227
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:06,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much, yeah.

228
00:19:07,031 --> 00:19:08,212
[SPEAKER_05]: Usually, it's two out of three.

229
00:19:08,252 --> 00:19:14,813
[SPEAKER_05]: This year, it's usually... Last year, because Thanksgiving was so early, we actually didn't have to move the November meeting.

230
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:15,853
[SPEAKER_05]: We usually have to move that one.

231
00:19:16,636 --> 00:19:19,278
[SPEAKER_05]: And usually it's that one Christmas, but this year, yeah.

232
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:25,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so let's start with the October week.

233
00:19:25,361 --> 00:19:33,326
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to move it forward a week, which would, I mean, luckily it's a, it's a three, it's a four, it's five Thursday month.

234
00:19:33,986 --> 00:19:37,208
[SPEAKER_05]: So it wouldn't be the fourth Thursday in this case, 24th.

235
00:19:38,028 --> 00:19:45,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, that would give a little bit of a tighter window for people submitting applications, but we're kind of nearing, you know, basically that, that still,

236
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:47,480
[SPEAKER_05]: four weeks.

237
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:54,686
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just need, I basically would need stuff by the end of next week in order to get the ads in the paper.

238
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:55,266
[SPEAKER_05]: I should know the 10th.

239
00:19:55,306 --> 00:19:55,406
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

240
00:19:55,486 --> 00:19:56,667
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to get the ads in by the 10th.

241
00:19:56,687 --> 00:19:59,490
[SPEAKER_05]: So that gives us another, almost like two, two full weeks.

242
00:20:01,171 --> 00:20:01,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

243
00:20:01,591 --> 00:20:03,633
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, it's doable.

244
00:20:04,073 --> 00:20:10,899
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the main reason why I'm kind of maybe pushing for that one is that I will be out of town on November 7th.

245
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,442
[SPEAKER_08]: So, and the seventh doesn't work for me either.

246
00:20:15,143 --> 00:20:15,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

247
00:20:16,134 --> 00:20:18,955
[SPEAKER_09]: How many cases are already on next month's agenda?

248
00:20:20,096 --> 00:20:21,576
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, none.

249
00:20:21,956 --> 00:20:26,258
[SPEAKER_05]: One that I've been talking to the applicant and they're going to be submitting in the next day or so, I believe.

250
00:20:26,618 --> 00:20:27,399
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one.

251
00:20:27,439 --> 00:20:36,983
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the one in Elm Street, and I don't know, I know that Attorney Desmond has been speaking with staff about what to do with that one.

252
00:20:37,183 --> 00:20:39,504
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know if that is actually going forward or not.

253
00:20:39,684 --> 00:20:41,145
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know the status of that right now.

254
00:20:41,165 --> 00:20:41,925
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you all do.

255
00:20:44,312 --> 00:20:48,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Danielle might know more, but is she essentially withdrew?

256
00:20:50,404 --> 00:20:53,911
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard anything from her.

257
00:20:54,432 --> 00:20:54,612
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

258
00:20:55,382 --> 00:21:00,365
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, she notified us a while back that she was going to put it on hold or withdraw.

259
00:21:01,686 --> 00:21:06,909
[SPEAKER_09]: And we made it clear that your withdrawal does not trip the constructive approval clock.

260
00:21:06,969 --> 00:21:07,689
[SPEAKER_09]: And she agrees.

261
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:13,072
[SPEAKER_09]: But I have not heard anything recent either about what her plans are to come back with anything.

262
00:21:14,433 --> 00:21:15,113
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's unknown.

263
00:21:16,294 --> 00:21:17,055
[SPEAKER_09]: just sitting out there.

264
00:21:17,155 --> 00:21:19,456
[SPEAKER_05]: I can check with her, but so that's a possibility.

265
00:21:19,516 --> 00:21:21,178
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the other one I think is going to go forward.

266
00:21:21,318 --> 00:21:25,140
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there might be one other one that they're working on getting their things together.

267
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:36,348
[SPEAKER_05]: So it doesn't look like it would be the only other thing which will probably be on that hearing that if we do it, then is, um, the 4,000 miss Charlie Parkway 40 D they've made some.

268
00:21:37,809 --> 00:21:43,213
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been some tweaks to the design, which would merit having come back before us for approval.

269
00:21:44,334 --> 00:21:44,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

270
00:21:46,083 --> 00:21:53,667
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way that process works is that they submit and then we have 20 days to have a meeting.

271
00:21:53,707 --> 00:22:00,091
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been talking to them and they're going to like whatever date we schedule our meeting for, they'll file within those.

272
00:22:00,271 --> 00:22:04,013
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're not trying to screw us over and, you know, trying to force us.

273
00:22:04,473 --> 00:22:07,495
[SPEAKER_05]: And they agree that, you know, let's just do it on the regularly scheduled meeting.

274
00:22:07,735 --> 00:22:10,216
[SPEAKER_05]: They were fine with that to move forward.

275
00:22:12,983 --> 00:22:15,744
[SPEAKER_05]: That would probably also be that meeting.

276
00:22:15,764 --> 00:22:29,868
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think if we just go back from the 24th, that means they have to submit by Friday the 4th, which I'm relatively sure that they are ready to do so.

277
00:22:30,108 --> 00:22:37,230
[SPEAKER_05]: We're looking at then October 24th for the October meeting, unless anyone has any conflicts.

278
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:39,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, Jim, Andre.

279
00:22:41,292 --> 00:22:41,612
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out.

280
00:22:45,079 --> 00:22:47,700
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have my board meeting for my building.

281
00:22:48,301 --> 00:22:49,421
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm at another meeting.

282
00:22:49,441 --> 00:22:50,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

283
00:22:50,662 --> 00:22:50,842
[SPEAKER_00]: 24th, sorry.

284
00:22:54,403 --> 00:22:54,643
[SPEAKER_06]: October 24th.

285
00:22:54,663 --> 00:22:55,824
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, okay, I am available.

286
00:22:55,844 --> 00:23:04,388
[SPEAKER_06]: I am taking a vacation tour at the end of October, so I'm not 100% certain whether I will be available or not.

287
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:18,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Should be able to do it by zoom.

288
00:23:18,372 --> 00:23:23,796
[SPEAKER_07]: I will, I will be available.

289
00:23:27,298 --> 00:23:28,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Did Mary ever join?

290
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:30,961
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, yeah, she was.

291
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:36,044
[SPEAKER_05]: At a wake, so I don't know if she was a little unsure of how long she was going to be there.

292
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:37,626
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just understandable.

293
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:38,426
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

294
00:23:38,506 --> 00:23:41,488
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think.

295
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:43,470
[SPEAKER_07]: To.

296
00:23:46,646 --> 00:23:47,966
[SPEAKER_05]: 3 million at least.

297
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:52,988
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds like we should go for it and yeah.

298
00:23:53,768 --> 00:23:55,608
[SPEAKER_05]: And if need be we can you know it.

299
00:23:56,008 --> 00:24:00,649
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but I was let's let's put a pin on that one for that they'll contact.

300
00:24:02,390 --> 00:24:15,973
[SPEAKER_05]: The attorney for the sky Parkway and tell them that we're looking at that they know I'll send an e-mail and you can get Mary and Mike as well confirmation that I'll do that but that so maybe in that case maybe

301
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:22,435
[SPEAKER_05]: If we do that, then we November into the 20.

302
00:24:25,377 --> 00:24:25,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we do that?

303
00:24:25,977 --> 00:24:26,738
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we do the.

304
00:24:27,518 --> 00:24:29,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we kind of move them all up a bit a week or.

305
00:24:30,741 --> 00:24:35,464
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we can put a pin on the November 1, just in case.

306
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:41,729
[SPEAKER_05]: And then same thing with the December, just sort of get the October 1 sort of sorted.

307
00:24:42,129 --> 00:24:45,331
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that might sort of lead us to when the other meeting is going to be.

308
00:24:45,351 --> 00:24:47,733
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm kind of looking at weeks in between meetings.

309
00:24:48,368 --> 00:24:53,192
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do it on the 24th, and we push the November meeting to the 5th of December.

310
00:24:53,232 --> 00:24:54,833
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like a long time in between.

311
00:24:54,873 --> 00:24:55,994
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe the 21st then.

312
00:24:56,454 --> 00:25:02,859
[SPEAKER_08]: And then if we do... And then now we're still in the Thanksgiving holiday.

313
00:25:02,899 --> 00:25:06,041
[SPEAKER_08]: You've still got three weeks.

314
00:25:07,122 --> 00:25:09,023
[SPEAKER_05]: Three, four weeks pretty much between meetings.

315
00:25:09,084 --> 00:25:14,848
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that's usually enough time to sort of get stuff in, especially given the new process, I think.

316
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:17,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Things go in a little bit quicker.

317
00:25:17,571 --> 00:25:21,453
[SPEAKER_05]: So as long as I get time to get the lead client in, that's really all that we need to worry about.

318
00:25:23,595 --> 00:25:25,516
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're saying Thursday, November 21st?

319
00:25:28,759 --> 00:25:30,099
[SPEAKER_05]: At the moment, yeah.

320
00:25:30,260 --> 00:25:38,345
[SPEAKER_05]: As a temporary one, yeah, I think that's because that'll be basically four full weeks in between hearings, as opposed to six weeks if we do the other one.

321
00:25:38,365 --> 00:25:41,508
[SPEAKER_05]: And then same thing with, I think around Christmas, I think that might

322
00:25:43,813 --> 00:25:50,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we can hold off on the Christmas one for now, the December one for now, just because it may be the 19th or the 2nd.

323
00:25:50,056 --> 00:25:53,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the 2nd is probably more likely because people go away.

324
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:56,479
[SPEAKER_05]: People are planning trips.

325
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,341
[SPEAKER_05]: Christmas is sort of tougher before.

326
00:26:01,202 --> 00:26:07,425
[SPEAKER_05]: Christmas time is tougher before the 25th than it is after for people's scheduling.

327
00:26:10,628 --> 00:26:14,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I know I got nothing going on, but I'm a, I'm a single guy with no kids.

328
00:26:14,329 --> 00:26:14,850
[SPEAKER_05]: So.

329
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:19,731
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not my schedule is pretty wide open.

330
00:26:19,751 --> 00:26:23,393
[SPEAKER_00]: I booked my travel already for.

331
00:26:23,993 --> 00:26:27,554
[SPEAKER_00]: That month, so I'm here for the 19th, but I'm not here for the 2nd.

332
00:26:28,675 --> 00:26:29,455
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, that's good to know.

333
00:26:29,475 --> 00:26:29,775
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

334
00:26:29,815 --> 00:26:29,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.

335
00:26:32,416 --> 00:26:37,458
[SPEAKER_05]: We can sort of, let's just put a pin on that 1 for now, but, you know, let's just so then state that the October meeting.

336
00:26:38,123 --> 00:26:43,485
[SPEAKER_05]: will be on October 24th and the November meeting will be on November 21st.

337
00:26:43,565 --> 00:27:01,873
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's pretty much it for administrative stuff.

338
00:27:06,388 --> 00:27:10,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, um, does anybody have any other items?

339
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:12,731
[SPEAKER_08]: New business.

340
00:27:15,993 --> 00:27:27,259
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, for, um, actually, I'll give a quick update, um, for the commissioner and Daniel and for actually everybody we are working on the update to the rules and regulations for the board.

341
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:32,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, so with the changes that have been made for the process, uh, for

342
00:27:32,879 --> 00:27:36,021
[SPEAKER_08]: Bringing projects in, we are making updates.

343
00:27:38,063 --> 00:27:44,168
[SPEAKER_08]: The commissioner had sent us a couple of draft, a couple of other cities that have updated their zoning processes.

344
00:27:44,228 --> 00:27:52,274
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're reviewing those and looking at changes to update for both the process coming into the board as well as the board's processes itself.

345
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:57,158
[SPEAKER_08]: And we should hope to have a draft for that ready by the next meeting.

346
00:28:03,575 --> 00:28:08,519
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.

347
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:17,046
[SPEAKER_08]: And with no other business, we have set the next meeting for October 21 at 630.

348
00:28:17,306 --> 00:28:20,348
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, no.

349
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:21,049
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.
