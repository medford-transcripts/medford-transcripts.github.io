    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=92.118">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=93.319">If</a>  you could give your name and address for the record.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=96.041">My</a>  name is Lubna Kiadi. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=98.202">Address</a>  is 39 Taft Street in Medford.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=103.386">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=104.487">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=110.051">So</a>  the house is currently, when we purchased the house, it was two bedrooms. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=119.204">a</a>  single family house. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=122.006">I</a>  have three kids, my mom living with me. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=126.77">So</a>  we need to expand the size of the room to at least four bedrooms so we can all have a privacy, kids can have privacy, me, my mom, my husband. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=140.552">I</a>  was looking forward to extend the size of the family and one of the bedrooms, which puts me in a situation that I'm not meet the requirements for the street and the border with my neighbor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=160.989">It's</a>  not too much that I need to expand, it's only, <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=169.707">The</a>  size is like 8 inches or 8 feet. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=176.813">So</a>  currently my son is having asthma from sleeping in the basement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=183.138">And</a>  it's getting worse. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=186.641">So</a>  we have to... <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=192.385">So</a>  we're in a situation that we have to add another second floor. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=196.627">It's</a>  not optional right now.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=202.23">OK.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=202.39">Do</a>  you want to display any content? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=206.753">Do</a>  you want to have Dennis share any of the files that you sent over?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=214.236">Do</a>  I have to?</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=216.297">No,</a>  I can do it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=216.857">I</a>  can show the map, sort of the plan that sort of shows the house if you want. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=220.479">So</a>  everyone can sort of visually see it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=222.5">Let</a>  me do that right now.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=224.762">Yeah,</a>  the lab plan would be the best item.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=228.764">All</a>  right, is everyone seeing this? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=241.937">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=242.457">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=242.757">Let</a>  me just zoom in a little bit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=247.88">That's</a>  too much, I think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=252.662">Sorry.</a> </p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=253.743">No</a>  worries.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=254.823">Here</a>  we go. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=262.967">Where</a>  my arrow is, this is the corner of the house that's adding on that's requiring the <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=271.539">the</a>  zoning position.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=276.622">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=277.262">The</a>  red line, that's where we need to expand from the side. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=283.266">It's</a>  like two feet on six.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=290.591">Then</a>  seven feet coming forward to the street.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=295.734">That</a>  has already existed, the one in front. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=301.29">So</a>  we're not changing the measurements. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=305.393">We're</a>  just extending the wall.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=312.437">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=313.638">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=315.459">Any</a>  questions from the board?</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=316.86">Commissioner?</a> </p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=328.933">I</a>  do want to clarify the front setback, both corners come into play here as encroachments on the front setback. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=338.356">So</a>  they're both, you're looking at both the two as a finding or a special permit for finding for an extension of non-conformity on both corners.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=348.419">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=348.979">Thank</a>  you for the correction. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=350.399">It's</a>  the one corner for the side yard setback and then both corners for the front.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=354.36">Yeah,</a>  both sides.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=355.241">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=355.841">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=372.453">Any</a>  questions from the board? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=374.555">I'll</a>  just throw that out there one more time. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=382.602">And</a>  just a clarification for me to everyone, the, the original filing in the note was that this was a request for variance, but the commissioner did just qualify and we did discuss that. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=395.427">This</a>  is will be a special permit, not a variance.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=400.509">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=406.318">The</a>  size of the room, it won't be in a good size room and a good size living room to extend the sides. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=413.241">And</a>  the rooms will be in a weird shape if it's not extended from both sides. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=420.124">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=431.527">Okay,</a>  Chris, go ahead.</p>

    <p>[Chris D'Aveta]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=435.189">Yes,</a>  I just have a, you know, sort of a question about whether or not that area in the front of the house, since we don't have an elevation or photo, was that originally a porch? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=452.298">And</a>  is it an enclosed porch?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=455.74">It's</a>  a closed porch.</p>

    <p>[Chris D'Aveta]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=457.121">Yeah,</a>  so I don't know if that <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=459.726">that</a>  doesn't factor into our discussions tonight, I guess, if building commissioner feels that's... So we don't have the thing that we don't have that like a sidewalk in the street.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=474.218">So</a>  there is a lot of houses in our street that they have that wall like that close to the streets. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=482.364">It's</a>  not, that's how the streets as we don't have <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=486.867">like</a>  a sidewalk and like their houses, they're already built like that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=492.088">Hi,</a>  how are you guys? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=493.968">So</a>  I'm Briss. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=496.269">So</a>  I want to just explain to you that the front is like, it's called like a sun room. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=503.01">It</a>  already exists. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=503.85">We</a>  will not add anything in the front. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=506.751">So</a>  it's already sun room. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=510.692">It's</a>  fully enclosed already. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=512.848">We're</a>  going to only add the sides, like two feet and a half on the right and two feet on the right, on the left.</p>

    <p>[Chris D'Aveta]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=524.751">Yeah,</a>  I understood what the proposal is. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=527.432">I</a>  just didn't know. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=528.993">Perhaps,</a>  Mr. Chair, through you, to the building commissioner, is there any factor other than the type of construction that's done on that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=541.944">proposed</a>  extension that would differ from it being a different portion of the house? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=550.686">It</a>  doesn't matter from our perspective. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=552.226">It's</a>  just the setback that we're looking at.</p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=555.007">It's</a>  considered part of the structure, part of the footprint being fully enclosed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=562.028">It</a>  doesn't really have any bearing per se.</p>

    <p>[Chris D'Aveta]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=565.969">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=566.269">That's</a>  all I was curious about. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=567.629">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Yvette Velez]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=580.911">I</a>  have one question. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=582.392">That</a>  addition, that's from the top through the bottom, right? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=587.576">Because</a>  they're adding that bit for the second floor?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=591.518">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=592.499">Yeah,</a>  we're adding that in the second floor too. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=594.6">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=597.442">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=598.543">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=657.704">Uh,</a>  your letters for the board, there were some letters with questions about the project, but nothing that would be that were that was asked to submit to the board.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=667.616">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=670.839">I</a>  don't see any hands raised in zoom. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=673.202">Do</a>  you have any other anything else in email Dennis?</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=689.028">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=690.609">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=691.81">Chair</a>  awaits a motion to enter deliberation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=696.593">To</a>  close the public comment and enter deliberation.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=701.877">Are</a>  we going to know the decision today?</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=705.88">Yep,</a>  the board's going to discuss it now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=707.962">OK,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Chris D'Aveta]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=711.064">I</a>  second that motion. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=714.085">Somebody</a>  needs to make it first. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=715.865">Oh,</a>  I thought you made it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=717.086">I</a>  can't make it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=718.046">I</a>  mean, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=720.446">Make</a>  the motion to close public comment. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=725.467">And</a>  enter deliberation.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=726.548">Thank</a>  you, guys. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=727.068">And</a>  enter deliberation. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=729.568">Roll</a>  call. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=730.969">Yvette?</a> </p>

    <p>[Yvette Velez]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=734.649">Aye.</a> </p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=735.73">Jim?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=736.81">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=738.21">Chris?</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=739.55">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=741.371">And</a>  Andre? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=743.838">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=744.998">And</a>  Jamie, aye. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=745.638">All</a>  right, from a deliberation perspective, again, this is for a special permit, not a variance, so we're going to be looking at circumstances relating to soil condition, shape, topography of the land or structures, where a literal enforcement of provisions of the ordinance or bylaw would involve a substantial hardship, financial or otherwise, to the petitioner. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=771.834">and</a>  that desirable relief may be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and without nullifying or substantially derogating from the intent or purpose of the ordinance or bylaw. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=783.577">So,</a>  this is for the board's discussion.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=787.779">Oh,</a>  okay.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=795.441">All</a>  right. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=797.041">Anything</a>  for discussion from the board?</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=805.61">Jamie</a>  this is Andre you know, I think this seems reasonable to me, I think we want to. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=815.713">It</a>  doesn't exacerbate any you know any detrimental impact I think on on the neighborhood and it would seems like it's something that that we could do it's a modest modest ask and modest give.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=831.497">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Chris D'Aveta]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=842.005">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=842.365">Oh,</a>  I'm sorry. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=843.826">Similarly</a>  to Andre, I didn't really have any issues with it, especially if, you know, if, as Dennis says, there are no objections from the abutters and would only be the immediate abutters, I imagine, that would be, you know, interested or affected by such a change. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=870.463">And</a>  it's pretty minimal.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=874.227">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=877.249">Thank</a>  you, Chris. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=879.55">Yeah,</a>  I'm in agreement. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=881.231">Obviously</a>  we're looking at the extension of a pre existing condition. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=885.313">There's</a>  no increase to that either. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=889.255">So</a>  I definitely see the need for the family with regards to the improvements to the property and the fact that it does not extend. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=899.761">This</a>  is an extension, not an increase. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=903.308">to</a>  the nonconformity. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=907.089">So</a>  I don't see any negative impact to the area, for the neighborhood. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=920.414">And</a>  obviously from a construction perspective, with regards to the position of the property, there's not much else they can do with what they're planning to move forward with.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=933.723">I</a>  also agree with everything that's been said. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=938.504">Thank</a>  you, Jim. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=939.524">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=945.166">Chair</a>  awaits a motion.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=954.908">A</a>  motion to approve the special permit for 39 Taft Street. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=958.249">Seconded.</a> </p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=964.137">Thank</a>  you and thank you Chris Roco Andre. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=970.201">I.</a>  Chris I event. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=976.106">I</a>  Jim I and Jamie I. You have so we've got an approval for the special permit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=992.149">We</a>  don't have an attorney on your side, Dennis will work on putting that decision together.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1000.397">So,</a>  Luna, I'll write the decision. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1001.959">I'll</a>  try and get it in and get it signed as quickly as possible. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1005.222">It's</a>  gonna get both. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1007.352">After</a>  we do it, it's going to get checked by our legal counsel, which is usually a pretty quick turnaround. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1011.314">And</a>  then the board members will sign that, and then it gets filed in the clerk's office. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1015.496">And</a>  then after that, there's a three-week waiting period before you can actually get your permit. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1020.198">But</a>  you can go into the building department and sort of talk about steps you need to do to get that building permit in the interim. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1025.78">But</a>  you can't actually get the final permit until all that time has passed. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1029.322">So</a>  it'll take a little bit of time, but we'll try to get this through as quickly as possible for you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1033.964">Thank</a>  you so much. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1034.764">Thank</a>  you so much, guys, for your time.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1038.71">You're</a>  welcome.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1040.19">I</a>  understand it.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1044.031">Okay,</a>  I believe that so that is our only case for today.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1049.193">So</a>  the only administrative... A couple other things, so yeah, so we do have the meeting minutes, not from the August meeting, but from the July meeting that I sent to you after the last meeting for approval, if we, you know, if folks reviewed them or not, but we can get a vote on that.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1073.418">We</a>  have the did everybody have an opportunity to review those minutes.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1089.164">If</a>  we can just do it at the next meeting, that's easier.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1097.327">Yeah,</a>  if we could do it at the next meeting, that would be great.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1100.308">Okay,</a>  yeah, thank you. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1101.409">So,</a>  we can table that and then the other thing, which we need to discuss is a couple of things is basically scheduling for the basically the next. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1109.232">We</a>  can do at least next month, but just as sort of a. Heads up that, you know, October meeting is Halloween. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1116.615">So,</a>  I don't really see having a meeting on Halloween. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1120.016">The</a>  November meeting is Thanksgiving. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1123.497">And</a>  the December meeting is the day after Christmas. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1126.319">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1129.328">I</a>  think I would like to sort of at least, at the very bare minimum, get a date for the October meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1134.729">And</a>  hopefully, you know, I think we can sort of discuss the other ones as well. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1138.53">We've</a>  got five of us here, so I think we can... Isn't that called a trifecta or something? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1145.371">Pretty</a>  much, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1147.031">Usually,</a>  it's two out of three. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1148.252">This</a>  year, it's usually... Last year, because Thanksgiving was so early, we actually didn't have to move the November meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1154.833">We</a>  usually have to move that one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1156.636">And</a>  usually it's that one Christmas, but this year, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1161.119">Okay,</a>  so let's start with the October week. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1165.361">We</a>  need to move it forward a week, which would, I mean, luckily it's a, it's a three, it's a four, it's five Thursday month. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1173.986">So</a>  it wouldn't be the fourth Thursday in this case, 24th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1178.028">Um,</a>  that would give a little bit of a tighter window for people submitting applications, but we're kind of nearing, you know, basically that, that still, <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1186.919">four</a>  weeks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1187.56">So</a>  I just need, I basically would need stuff by the end of next week in order to get the ads in the paper. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1194.726">I</a>  should know the 10th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1195.306">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1195.486">I</a>  have to get the ads in by the 10th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1196.687">So</a>  that gives us another, almost like two, two full weeks. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1201.171">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1201.591">So,</a>  um, it's doable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1204.073">I</a>  think the main reason why I'm kind of maybe pushing for that one is that I will be out of town on November 7th.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1211.48">So,</a>  and the seventh doesn't work for me either.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1215.143">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1216.134">How</a>  many cases are already on next month's agenda?</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1220.096">Right</a>  now, none. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1221.956">One</a>  that I've been talking to the applicant and they're going to be submitting in the next day or so, I believe. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1226.618">So</a>  that's one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1227.439">And</a>  then the one in Elm Street, and I don't know, I know that Attorney Desmond has been speaking with staff about what to do with that one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1237.183">And</a>  I don't know if that is actually going forward or not. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1239.684">So</a>  I don't know the status of that right now. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1241.165">I</a>  don't know if you all do.</p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1244.312">Danielle</a>  might know more, but is she essentially withdrew?</p>

    <p>[Yvette Velez]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1250.404">I</a>  haven't heard anything from her. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1254.432">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Scott Vandewalle]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1255.382">Yeah,</a>  she notified us a while back that she was going to put it on hold or withdraw. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1261.686">And</a>  we made it clear that your withdrawal does not trip the constructive approval clock. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1266.969">And</a>  she agrees. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1267.769">But</a>  I have not heard anything recent either about what her plans are to come back with anything. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1274.433">So</a>  it's unknown. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1276.294">just</a>  sitting out there.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1277.155">I</a>  can check with her, but so that's a possibility. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1279.516">I</a>  think the other one I think is going to go forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1281.318">And</a>  then there might be one other one that they're working on getting their things together. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1285.2">So</a>  it doesn't look like it would be the only other thing which will probably be on that hearing that if we do it, then is, um, the 4,000 miss Charlie Parkway 40 D they've made some. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1297.809">There's</a>  been some tweaks to the design, which would merit having come back before us for approval. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1304.334">Um,</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1306.083">And</a>  the way that process works is that they submit and then we have 20 days to have a meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1313.707">So</a>  I've been talking to them and they're going to like whatever date we schedule our meeting for, they'll file within those. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1320.271">So</a>  they're not trying to screw us over and, you know, trying to force us. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1324.473">And</a>  they agree that, you know, let's just do it on the regularly scheduled meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1327.735">They</a>  were fine with that to move forward. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1332.983">That</a>  would probably also be that meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1335.764">Because</a>  I think if we just go back from the 24th, that means they have to submit by Friday the 4th, which I'm relatively sure that they are ready to do so. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1350.108">We're</a>  looking at then October 24th for the October meeting, unless anyone has any conflicts.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1358.391">Yeah,</a>  Jim, Andre.</p>

    <p>[Yvette Velez]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1361.292">I'm</a>  out. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1365.079">Yeah,</a>  I have my board meeting for my building. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1368.301">So</a>  I'm at another meeting. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1369.441">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1370.662">24th,</a>  sorry.</p>

    <p>[Chris D'Aveta]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1374.403">October</a>  24th. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1374.663">Yeah,</a>  okay, I am available. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1375.844">I</a>  am taking a vacation tour at the end of October, so I'm not 100% certain whether I will be available or not.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1396.27">Should</a>  be able to do it by zoom.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1398.372">I</a>  will, I will be available. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1407.298">Did</a>  Mary ever join?</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1410.0">No,</a>  no, yeah, she was. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1412.002">At</a>  a wake, so I don't know if she was a little unsure of how long she was going to be there. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1416.625">That's</a>  just understandable. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1418.166">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1418.506">But</a>  I think.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1423.39">To.</a> </p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1426.646">3</a>  million at least.</p>

    <p>[Andre Leroux]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1429.127">It</a>  sounds like we should go for it and yeah.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1433.768">And</a>  if need be we can you know it. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1436.008">You</a>  know, but I was let's let's put a pin on that one for that they'll contact. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1442.39">The</a>  attorney for the sky Parkway and tell them that we're looking at that they know I'll send an e-mail and you can get Mary and Mike as well confirmation that I'll do that but that so maybe in that case maybe <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1458.832">If</a>  we do that, then we November into the 20. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1465.377">Do</a>  we do that? <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1465.977">And</a>  then we do the. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1467.518">Do</a>  we kind of move them all up a bit a week or. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1470.741">Maybe</a>  we can put a pin on the November 1, just in case. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1476.685">And</a>  then same thing with the December, just sort of get the October 1 sort of sorted. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1482.129">And</a>  then that might sort of lead us to when the other meeting is going to be. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1485.351">I'm</a>  kind of looking at weeks in between meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1488.368">So</a>  we do it on the 24th, and we push the November meeting to the 5th of December. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1493.232">That's</a>  like a long time in between. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1494.873">So</a>  maybe the 21st then.</p>

    <p>[KaEkSOLEwkQ_SPEAKER_31]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1496.454">And</a>  then if we do... And then now we're still in the Thanksgiving holiday. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1502.899">You've</a>  still got three weeks.</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1507.122">Three,</a>  four weeks pretty much between meetings. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1509.084">So</a>  I think that's usually enough time to sort of get stuff in, especially given the new process, I think. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1515.929">Things</a>  go in a little bit quicker. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1517.571">So</a>  as long as I get time to get the lead client in, that's really all that we need to worry about.</p>

    <p>[Yvette Velez]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1523.595">So</a>  we're saying Thursday, November 21st?</p>

    <p>[Denis MacDougall]</a>:  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1528.759">At</a>  the moment, yeah. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1530.26">As</a>  a temporary one, yeah, I think that's because that'll be basically four full weeks in between hearings, as opposed to six weeks if we do the other one. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1538.365">And</a>  then same thing with, I think around Christmas, I think that might <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1543.813">Maybe</a>  we can hold off on the Christmas one for now, the December one for now, just because it may be the 19th or the 2nd. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1550.056">I</a>  think the 2nd is probably more likely because people go away. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1555.019">People</a>  are planning trips. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1558.56">Christmas</a>  is sort of tougher before. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1561.202">Christmas</a>  time is tougher before the 25th than it is after for people's scheduling. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1570.628">I</a>  know I got nothing going on, but I'm a, I'm a single guy with no kids. <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1574.329">So.</a>  <a href="https://archive.org/details/zoning-board-of-appeals-09-26-24&start=1575.81">I'm</a>  not my schedule is pretty wide open.</p>
