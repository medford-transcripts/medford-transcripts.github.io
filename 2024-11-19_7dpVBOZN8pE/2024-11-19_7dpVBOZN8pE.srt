00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,061
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

145
00:12:30,202 --> 00:12:30,522
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure.

146
00:12:30,823 --> 00:12:31,443
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not sure.

147
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:39,229
[SPEAKER_11]: But, uh, timing wise, since the other grant of location we have, um, is kind of diagonally across the street is are these being tied together?

148
00:12:39,349 --> 00:12:42,531
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, as far as the intention of when to do the work, I know there's still, um.

149
00:12:43,312 --> 00:12:49,336
[SPEAKER_11]: Some requirements from our city engineer, but I'm curious the desired timing as far as the work of the two projects.

150
00:12:50,397 --> 00:12:51,938
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh I'm not

151
00:12:59,798 --> 00:13:00,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Knight.

152
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

153
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,842
[SPEAKER_08]: I certainly don't have any problem with this petition that's before us this evening.

154
00:13:04,942 --> 00:13:10,086
[SPEAKER_08]: If you drive through that area and that intersection in particular, I do believe there are three projects that are underway.

155
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:25,617
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the Greenland Extension Project, we have the Cummings Center Project, and I do also believe we have issued a grant of location for underground utility work coming from the train tracks on the southern side or the western side of the intersection of College Avenue and Boston Ave as well.

156
00:13:26,157 --> 00:13:27,977
[SPEAKER_08]: So I certainly have no problem with this, Mr. President.

157
00:13:28,017 --> 00:13:33,259
[SPEAKER_08]: I look forward to the day that the Green Line stations in South Medford Ball Square opens.

158
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:36,159
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that in order for that, we need to let them have electricity.

159
00:13:36,539 --> 00:13:38,200
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, I move approval.

160
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,780
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

161
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,901
[SPEAKER_07]: On the motion, Councilor Bears.

162
00:13:45,601 --> 00:13:47,221
[SPEAKER_07]: I just had a question for the city engineer.

163
00:13:47,281 --> 00:13:48,262
[SPEAKER_07]: Is he on the call?

164
00:13:48,602 --> 00:13:50,562
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Bears has a question for you.

165
00:13:50,582 --> 00:13:53,243
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep, I'm here.

166
00:13:55,733 --> 00:14:02,065
[SPEAKER_07]: addition for the plan, not including utility.

167
00:14:02,346 --> 00:14:03,468
[SPEAKER_07]: That's something that's been addressed.

168
00:14:07,022 --> 00:14:09,384
[SPEAKER_12]: So in a simple, this is a very simple crossing.

169
00:14:09,404 --> 00:14:15,428
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if you recall with the one, that Tufts one, which was more complicated, I requested that plan ahead of time.

170
00:14:15,848 --> 00:14:18,270
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a shallow conduit routing.

171
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:32,900
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was okay with moving this forward without that detailed plan, but I am requiring a detailed plan for the street opening, just so we have something a little bit more detailed for the utility crossings in the area, including one of MWRA's lines there.

172
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,281
[SPEAKER_22]: Got it.

173
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:34,842
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Tim.

174
00:14:35,765 --> 00:14:36,825
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, any further discussion?

175
00:14:37,746 --> 00:14:41,147
[SPEAKER_22]: So on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

176
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:43,368
[SPEAKER_22]: For approval, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

177
00:14:44,488 --> 00:14:45,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears?

178

[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Knight?

182
00:14:48,090 --> 00:14:48,430
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

183
00:14:48,550 --> 00:14:49,110
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks?

184
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:49,790
Yes.

185
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:50,551
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Morell?

186
00:14:50,731 --> 00:14:50,951
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

187
00:14:51,251 --> 00:14:51,911
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli?

188
00:14:51,931 --> 00:14:52,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

189
00:14:52,551 --> 00:14:53,212
[SPEAKER_22]: President Caraviello?

190
00:14:53,252 --> 00:14:54,232
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I move the affirmative.

191
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:55,172
[SPEAKER_22]: Motion passes.

00:16:31,749 --> 00:16:33,111
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry.

204
00:16:33,131 --> 00:16:33,731

206

00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:41,159
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Knight.

212
00:16:41,239 --> 00:16:41,560

[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

214
00:16:43,742 --> 00:16:43,962
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

215
00:16:45,884 --> 00:16:46,105
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

216
00:16:46,365 --> 00:16:46,825
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

217
00:16:46,946 --> 00:16:47,226
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

218
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:49,508
[SPEAKER_22]: Tim McGiven, City Engineer.

219
00:16:49,528 --> 00:16:51,911
[SPEAKER_22]: We can give a brief synopsis of this project.

220
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,173
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, I can.

221
00:16:54,193 --> 00:16:59,696
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe this is also a national grid project, similar to the last one.

222
00:17:01,176 --> 00:17:04,157
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is also for one of the Green Line stations.

223
00:17:04,778 --> 00:17:05,918
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is a much shorter run.

224
00:17:05,978 --> 00:17:11,080
[SPEAKER_12]: This is just under a sidewalk from a pole near the site, under the sidewalk to the site.

225
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,881
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a short run, just of secondary service.

226
00:17:13,961 --> 00:17:16,082
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's about it.

227
00:17:16,442 --> 00:17:19,944
[SPEAKER_12]: So a couple of concrete panels in coordination with the Green Line project.

228
00:17:20,284 --> 00:17:21,825
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't even believe they need to go on the roadway.

229
00:17:22,445 --> 00:17:22,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

230
00:17:25,005 --> 00:17:27,345
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so this is a public hearing.

231
00:17:29,746 --> 00:17:39,868
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Socrates, this is a public hearing and those who wish to speak in favor of this may do so.

232
00:17:40,708 --> 00:17:43,828
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, I'm in favor, Socrates Perez.

233
00:17:45,129 --> 00:17:45,769
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm in favor.

234
00:17:47,189 --> 00:17:48,149
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

235
00:17:48,229 --> 00:17:49,349
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyone else in favor of this?

236
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:53,130
[SPEAKER_22]: Hearing and seeing none, we close this part of the hearing.

237
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,271
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there anyone in opposition to this project?

238
00:18:02,332 --> 00:18:06,993
[SPEAKER_22]: Hearing and seeing none, we close this part of hearing.

239
00:18:07,713 --> 00:18:09,314
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

240
00:18:10,794 --> 00:18:13,115
[SPEAKER_22]: Do we have any discussion from the council on this?

241
00:18:14,015 --> 00:18:16,135
[SPEAKER_22]: For the reasons stated previously, Mr. President, move approval.

242
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,696
[SPEAKER_22]: On the motion by Vice President for approval.

243
00:18:20,056 --> 00:18:20,536
[SPEAKER_22]: One second.

244
00:18:21,377 --> 00:18:22,177
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Scarpelli.

245
00:18:24,821 --> 00:18:26,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Socrates, I thank you for being here tonight.

246
00:18:26,402 --> 00:18:29,024
[SPEAKER_04]: The question, you said it's going underneath.

247
00:18:29,385 --> 00:18:31,546
[SPEAKER_04]: So this project is going underneath the sidewalk?

248
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:33,007
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

249
00:18:34,068 --> 00:18:34,728
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

250
00:18:35,469 --> 00:18:37,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it existing sidewalk?

251
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:49,660
[SPEAKER_04]: It will be replaced with the proper cement forms?

252
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:52,702
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it hot top there now?

253
00:18:53,615 --> 00:18:56,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it will.

254
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:58,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so do we know if it's cement right now?

255
00:18:58,978 --> 00:18:59,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it hot top?

256
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:11,946
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to make sure that it's uniformed and that it's left better than what we gave it to.

257
00:19:11,966 --> 00:19:16,169
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just want to make sure of that.

258
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:17,430
[SPEAKER_04]: You can say yes, no, is it?

259
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:30,118
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, whatever the material is, cement or concrete or asphalt, we'll replace it in better condition of what it was, to the condition that it was.

260
00:19:31,398 --> 00:19:31,679
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

261
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:33,719
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

262
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:38,081
[SPEAKER_22]: So on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

263
00:19:39,382 --> 00:19:40,642
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

264
00:19:44,364 --> 00:19:44,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears.

265
00:19:45,084 --> 00:19:45,344
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

266
00:19:45,825 --> 00:19:46,545
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Falco.

267
00:19:47,244 --> 00:19:47,946
[SPEAKER_09]: Vice President Knight.

268
00:19:48,006 --> 00:19:48,307
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

269
00:19:48,627 --> 00:19:49,189
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks.

270
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:49,891
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

271
00:19:50,111 --> 00:19:50,713
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Morell.

272
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:51,134
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

273
00:19:51,735 --> 00:19:52,497
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli.

274
00:19:52,597 --> 00:19:52,798
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

275
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:53,660
[SPEAKER_09]: President Caraviello.

276
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:54,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

277
00:19:55,063 --> 00:19:56,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

278
00:20:15,108 --> 00:20:17,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

279
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,692
[SPEAKER_08]: Council paper 21382 offered by President Caraviello.

280
00:20:23,272 --> 00:20:30,877
[SPEAKER_08]: Be it so resolved that the city completely paved the area of new construction from Woburn Street to Auburn Street, rather than just the new intersection.

281
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:35,799
[SPEAKER_08]: And be it further resolved, the new island on High Street be discussed in the interest of public safety.

282
00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:36,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Caraviello.

283
00:20:47,572 --> 00:20:50,192
[SPEAKER_22]: I think he started this last year.

284
00:20:50,993 --> 00:20:52,553
[SPEAKER_22]: And it's nearing completion.

285
00:20:52,593 --> 00:21:00,594
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if anyone's driven up that way, but they're pretty much done with all the sidewalks, bump outs, and the concrete sidewalks have been fixed.

286
00:21:00,734 --> 00:21:07,515
[SPEAKER_22]: But they're planning on just repaving those intersections, which to me is foolish.

287
00:21:08,736 --> 00:21:10,576
[SPEAKER_22]: You've got those four blocks, the trucks are there.

288
00:21:12,296 --> 00:21:15,797
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't see why the city just doesn't pay the contractor to

289
00:21:18,045 --> 00:21:28,629
[SPEAKER_22]: pave those probably maybe a hundred yards of paving to at least make that section look uniform.

290
00:21:28,909 --> 00:21:38,533
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I think it's harder for them to cut off sections of concrete and put in little patches and it'd be more uniform if it's just paved with those four blocks.

291
00:21:39,134 --> 00:21:42,515
[SPEAKER_22]: And further, I don't know if anyone's also driven by there,

292
00:21:44,005 --> 00:21:49,388
[SPEAKER_22]: They put an island there on the top of right under this intersection of Woburn Street and high.

293
00:21:49,488 --> 00:21:54,231
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't know if our traffic engineer signed off on that.

294
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:56,292
[SPEAKER_22]: It's in a very dangerous location.

295
00:21:57,052 --> 00:21:58,053
[SPEAKER_22]: There's no light on it.

296
00:21:59,094 --> 00:22:02,295
[SPEAKER_22]: And anybody coming up during the night is not going to see it.

297
00:22:02,395 --> 00:22:07,138
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm telling you now, that's going to be hit multiple times going forward.

298
00:22:07,779 --> 00:22:11,321
[SPEAKER_22]: And we've had the same issue with the one that's in front of the Brook School.

299
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:13,462
[SPEAKER_22]: The science team coming down and

300
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:19,755
[SPEAKER_22]: And the other thing that bothers me, we now have another concrete block there.

301
00:22:20,135 --> 00:22:24,658
[SPEAKER_22]: Why couldn't that have been left open with some irrigation so we could have put some plantings in the middle of it?

302
00:22:25,059 --> 00:22:33,665
[SPEAKER_22]: So at least it would have made it look somewhat better looking than just a hunk of concrete with four poles on it and no light or anything.

303
00:22:34,086 --> 00:22:40,510
[SPEAKER_22]: So I would hope that the administration would look forward into having McCain Company at least

304
00:22:43,217 --> 00:22:56,625
[SPEAKER_22]: give them a quota on paving on paving that from the whole four block section and having that our traffic engineer review that islands in the interest of public safety Mr. President.

305
00:23:02,489 --> 00:23:06,611
[SPEAKER_08]: I certainly agree with the Mr. President on a motion by Councilor Caraviello seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

306
00:23:06,631 --> 00:23:09,033
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, Councilor Marks you have the floor.

307
00:23:09,794 --> 00:23:10,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

308
00:23:10,495 --> 00:23:13,856
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank President Caraviello for putting this on the agenda tonight.

309
00:23:14,677 --> 00:23:25,423
[SPEAKER_05]: When this issue was presented to the city council, that was one of the recommendations the president council, President Caraviello just mentioned, was to have the area be paved in totality.

310
00:23:25,803 --> 00:23:36,469
[SPEAKER_05]: So rather than space it from one intersection to another, which didn't make sense, was to have that stretch, which is only maybe a couple hundred yards, four or 500 yards,

311
00:23:38,063 --> 00:23:40,304
[SPEAKER_05]: to have it paved curb to curb the entire length.

312
00:23:41,264 --> 00:23:47,725
[SPEAKER_05]: And that would increase the longevity of the construction, the roadwork itself.

313
00:23:48,366 --> 00:23:50,206
[SPEAKER_05]: And it only made sense, Mr. President.

314
00:23:50,686 --> 00:24:03,309
[SPEAKER_05]: Secondly, this council voted unanimously to continue the bike lane, which starts in front of Brooks School and goes all the way up to the top of High Street.

315
00:24:04,329 --> 00:24:06,890
[SPEAKER_05]: And then where it bends down, it actually stops.

316
00:24:07,473 --> 00:24:19,843
[SPEAKER_05]: And we ask that they continue the bike lane to Winter Circle, Mr. President, because there'd be nothing worse than riding your bike there and all of a sudden come up to a decline where you're gonna pick up speed and there's no more bike lane.

317
00:24:20,423 --> 00:24:21,944
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes absolutely no sense.

318
00:24:22,385 --> 00:24:25,207
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know we have the city engineer on the line.

319
00:24:25,887 --> 00:24:33,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping maybe he can let us know if that is still under consideration, because I believe that was something the city was gonna look into.

320
00:24:34,214 --> 00:24:37,236
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would ask maybe if Tim McGiven could give us a response.

321
00:24:38,223 --> 00:24:40,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair recognizes City Engineer Timothy McGivern.

322
00:24:42,695 --> 00:24:44,236
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi, thank you very much, Councilors.

323
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:50,518
[SPEAKER_12]: So the issue of paving, we are coordinating with MassDOT to pave the whole stretch.

324
00:24:51,218 --> 00:24:58,441
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was a swap out to get more pedestrian-friendly lights, so the lights that are going in for the crossings.

325
00:24:58,782 --> 00:25:03,664
[SPEAKER_12]: So we did a trade-off on the budget of the project with the full intention from the beginning of completing the paving.

326
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,105
[SPEAKER_12]: You may have noticed that National Grid has been out there too.

327
00:25:06,225 --> 00:25:11,987
[SPEAKER_12]: So the idea, and the Water Division as well, replacing that services.

328
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:26,078
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're doing our typical prep work for, you know, fully paving the road from approximately, let's see, Auburn, the school, all the way to pass Woburn to the next street, excuse me, the next street down.

329
00:25:26,478 --> 00:25:27,619
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is the plan.

330
00:25:27,879 --> 00:25:35,805
[SPEAKER_12]: And then in regards to the bike lane, that's also something that we are looking into doing, extending the bike lane striping as discussed previously by this council.

331
00:25:36,706 --> 00:25:40,929
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the safety issue with the island, this is the second time that I've heard about this.

332
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:46,653
[SPEAKER_12]: We do review plans in my office, and Todd Blake, the traffic engineer, has reviewed these plans.

333
00:25:46,673 --> 00:25:49,315
[SPEAKER_12]: We've been involved through the design of the project.

334
00:25:49,635 --> 00:26:01,982
[SPEAKER_12]: But if there is something that was unanticipated, a safety concern that has arisen that's a legit concern, then we'll definitely check it out and make sure that any issues are resolved and there's no safety issues out there.

335
00:26:02,243 --> 00:26:03,904
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll definitely take it seriously for sure.

336
00:26:05,284 --> 00:26:06,305
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't remember if there was anything else.

337
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:07,386
[SPEAKER_12]: I think I touched upon everything.

338
00:26:10,227 --> 00:26:10,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President?

339
00:26:11,606 --> 00:26:13,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Council Max, just to follow up on that.

340
00:26:13,427 --> 00:26:14,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anything like that?

341
00:26:14,188 --> 00:26:15,588
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good, thank you, Chair.

342
00:26:15,668 --> 00:26:25,054
[SPEAKER_22]: If we can get a report back from Todd Blake on that island, it's in a very dangerous spot.

343
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:29,196
[SPEAKER_22]: It's on the crest of the hill.

344
00:26:29,216 --> 00:26:35,840
[SPEAKER_22]: It's nighttime, someone's going to be coming up that hill and they're going to hit that because there's no blinking light on it and they're not going to see it.

345
00:26:38,093 --> 00:26:40,814
[SPEAKER_22]: So I've been saying, if he could give us a report on that.

346
00:26:41,254 --> 00:26:49,178
[SPEAKER_22]: And I feel bad for the guy who just put in the new driveway there on the corner of Hastings Lane and High Street.

347
00:26:49,478 --> 00:26:52,299
[SPEAKER_22]: And I don't know how this guy's gonna get in and out of his driveway now.

348
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:54,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. President.

349
00:26:55,901 --> 00:27:05,145
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion of Councilor Caraviello, requesting a report back from the traffic engineer on the island at Woburn Street and Hastings Lane along High Street.

350
00:27:05,205 --> 00:27:06,606
[SPEAKER_08]: Does the chair have a second?

351
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

352
00:27:09,874 --> 00:27:10,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Final motion, Mr. Clerk.

353
00:27:13,037 --> 00:27:15,278
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, Councilor Falco, I apologize.

354
00:27:15,358 --> 00:27:15,859
[SPEAKER_10]: No worries.

355
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:16,579
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

356
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,863
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to thank Councilor Caraviello for bringing this forward and Councilor Marks.

357
00:27:21,983 --> 00:27:25,126
[SPEAKER_10]: I had some great questions regarding the bike lane.

358
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:32,572
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember when this issue came up previously, we were discussing the bike lane and at that point in time, it was kind of like a bike lane to nowhere.

359
00:27:32,592 --> 00:27:33,632
[SPEAKER_10]: It just kind of just stopped.

360
00:27:36,116 --> 00:27:38,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. McGovern, thank you for your response regarding the bike lane.

361
00:27:39,018 --> 00:27:42,760
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just wondering, you said that you're looking into it or the department's looking into it.

362
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:44,721
[SPEAKER_10]: If you could just talk about the process a little bit.

363
00:27:46,061 --> 00:27:48,423
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there going to be a meeting with the traffic engineer?

364
00:27:48,443 --> 00:27:50,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there any type of timing on that?

365
00:27:50,664 --> 00:27:51,885
[SPEAKER_10]: Could you elaborate a little bit more?

366
00:27:51,905 --> 00:27:55,086
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, I'd be happy to.

367
00:27:55,106 --> 00:27:56,507
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yep.

368
00:27:56,627 --> 00:27:56,967
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, sorry.

369
00:27:57,007 --> 00:27:58,408
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, thank you very much, Mr. President.

370
00:28:01,071 --> 00:28:07,198
[SPEAKER_12]: where the process begins because we know that, you know, obviously we need to pave the whole street.

371
00:28:07,258 --> 00:28:09,039
[SPEAKER_12]: So when you do that, then you talk about striping.

372
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,802
[SPEAKER_12]: So we know that MassDOT has striping scope in the project.

373
00:28:12,243 --> 00:28:13,444
[SPEAKER_12]: So we take a look at where that scope ends.

374
00:28:13,644 --> 00:28:16,127
[SPEAKER_12]: Excuse me, I'm eating peanuts and throat's a little dry.

375
00:28:18,175 --> 00:28:28,180
[SPEAKER_12]: Then, so the resolution was to extend the bike lane down so when we are preparing for that paving and preparing the striping plan for that will will we're going to try to extend it down as far as we can.

376
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:40,927
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you may recall when this was discussed last time that it's okay if bike lanes, you know, and nowhere, but you know the point is taken that it's it's in a place that maybe if we can extend this all the way to the circle or something further down we might be able to

377
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:45,151
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of bring cyclists to a safer, more calmer spot on the road.

378
00:28:45,752 --> 00:28:47,254
[SPEAKER_12]: So, factors go into it.

379
00:28:47,314 --> 00:29:01,269
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, we're going to measure widths, and we're going to make sure that sightlines are there, and we're going to make sure that we're not creating any problems by putting in new infrastructure, which is the similar design process that, you know, any engineer would go through when

380
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:06,813
[SPEAKER_12]: you're thinking about these things and laying it out prior to installing it.

381
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:16,077
[SPEAKER_12]: I may not sound committing, and that's just because we got to go through the rigmarole of the engineering judgments and standards to make sure that it's all going to work.

382
00:29:16,598 --> 00:29:24,222
[SPEAKER_12]: But that's what I mean when I say we're considering it, and we know that it's a desire, but we also don't want to do anything that creates a problem.

383
00:29:24,962 --> 00:29:31,991
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, if this island issue is really a problem, we try to foresee as many problems as we possibly can before we install things.

384
00:29:33,994 --> 00:29:35,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. McGivern.

385
00:29:35,356 --> 00:29:39,441
[SPEAKER_10]: And last but not least, what is the estimated completion date of this project?

386
00:29:40,683 --> 00:29:46,904
[SPEAKER_12]: So the original completion date was August and then they actually pushed things forward.

387
00:29:46,924 --> 00:29:49,725
[SPEAKER_12]: So they should be done actually within a few weeks here.

388
00:29:49,745 --> 00:29:57,166
[SPEAKER_12]: And then there may be some lag time between completion of the work that's happening now.

389
00:29:57,206 --> 00:30:02,507
[SPEAKER_12]: So the sidewalk works and the patching work and pulling the forms and all that and final paving.

390
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,907
[SPEAKER_12]: So that may happen in July or August.

391
00:30:06,648 --> 00:30:06,948
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

392
00:30:07,528 --> 00:30:07,928
[SPEAKER_12]: You're welcome.

393
00:30:09,149 --> 00:30:10,550
[SPEAKER_07]: Chair recognizes Councilor Bears.

394
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:18,694
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President, through you to engineer, we give her just two quick questions on the review of the extension of the bike lane.

395
00:30:18,974 --> 00:30:21,435
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a timeline on how long that will take?

396
00:30:23,745 --> 00:30:26,646
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, but before we issue the scope for the striping.

397
00:30:26,906 --> 00:30:36,649
[SPEAKER_12]: So we need to know the answer to that question where it's gonna land before we hire a contractor to do the paving and the striping.

398
00:30:36,869 --> 00:30:39,150
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're working on that piece now with MassDOT.

399
00:30:39,430 --> 00:30:46,552
[SPEAKER_12]: So doing the calculations for the area, how much is left, what's, you know, and who does what and who pays for what and kind of splitting that all up.

400
00:30:46,592 --> 00:30:47,952
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's kind of happening right now.

401
00:30:48,092 --> 00:30:50,913
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't have an exact date for you, but before,

402
00:30:51,733 --> 00:30:55,097
[SPEAKER_12]: Before we tell a contractor to go out and work, we'll have it all worked out.

403
00:30:56,178 --> 00:30:56,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.

404
00:30:56,518 --> 00:30:59,461
[SPEAKER_07]: And then my second question is actually about striping and painting.

405
00:31:00,422 --> 00:31:06,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Is there something included in the plan around striping and painting that may make the island more visible to drivers?

406
00:31:09,946 --> 00:31:13,647
[SPEAKER_12]: potentially, this is a new issue for me, so I need to look into it.

407
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:20,148
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure if there's a retrofit that needs to happen, if a curb needs to move, or if it's something more drastic or severe.

408
00:31:20,729 --> 00:31:25,050
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're gonna have to wait and see, give us a chance to look at it and understand what the issue is.

409
00:31:25,410 --> 00:31:30,071
[SPEAKER_12]: So because it's a safety issue, we're gonna look at it first thing tomorrow to try to understand what's going on.

410
00:31:31,111 --> 00:31:31,851
[SPEAKER_08]: Great, thank you.

411
00:31:32,931 --> 00:31:34,192
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Caraviello?

412
00:31:34,552 --> 00:31:35,292
[SPEAKER_22]: I think Mr. President,

413
00:31:37,842 --> 00:31:42,345
[SPEAKER_22]: I know we always, we've asked for the thermoplastic striping on multiple occasions.

414
00:31:42,785 --> 00:31:47,228
[SPEAKER_22]: We've always been told because the roads are so bad, we can't have, well, we're gonna have a new road there.

415
00:31:48,209 --> 00:31:57,895
[SPEAKER_22]: It would be my suggestion to the DOT to stripe those lines and the crosswalks with the thermoplastic paints.

416
00:31:58,356 --> 00:32:00,157
[SPEAKER_22]: So we won't be doing it every two years.

417
00:32:00,177 --> 00:32:03,199
[SPEAKER_22]: And again, like I said, the road's new,

418
00:32:03,915 --> 00:32:08,617
[SPEAKER_22]: Everything's new there there's no reason why they can't do that in the, and the longevity will be much longer.

419
00:32:10,518 --> 00:32:13,479
[SPEAKER_22]: Here a second on the amendment.

420
00:32:13,499 --> 00:32:18,041
[SPEAKER_08]: Make that a formal motion recognizes customer marks.

421
00:32:21,182 --> 00:32:24,603
[SPEAKER_22]: I know some, there's some guy in the council that kept on talking about it for many years.

422
00:32:37,608 --> 00:32:41,752
[SPEAKER_08]: Chair recognizes the gentleman from Zero Summit Road, Mr. Penta.

423
00:32:41,812 --> 00:32:44,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Robert Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of the Saugus body.

424
00:32:45,595 --> 00:32:50,420
[SPEAKER_02]: During this past week, I've had two conversations with two separate bus drivers from the MBTA.

425
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,121
[SPEAKER_02]: And their question is, cause I can't answer it.

426
00:32:52,141 --> 00:32:58,247
[SPEAKER_02]: So since you do have the city engineer online, they think this is a complete hasty comment.

427
00:32:58,755 --> 00:33:06,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Safety has it as Councilor Caraviello and a few of you alluded to, to having this island that sticks out on the corner of High Street and Woburn.

428
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:12,502
[SPEAKER_02]: So since we have the city engineer, could you please answer the question, whose idea was to put that island there?

429
00:33:13,022 --> 00:33:16,884
[SPEAKER_02]: And did that island come in as an afterthought to this construction project?

430
00:33:16,944 --> 00:33:23,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if that's the case, then I would strongly suggest that you folks recommend that that be removed before someone gets killed here.

431
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:27,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we ask the question, please, to the city engineer?

432
00:33:28,107 --> 00:33:30,269
[SPEAKER_08]: City engineer, Mr. McGibbon, the chair recognizes.

433
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:32,611
[SPEAKER_08]: City engineer, Timothy McGibbon, the question, gentlemen.

434
00:33:35,153 --> 00:33:35,674
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

435
00:33:35,894 --> 00:33:37,015
[SPEAKER_12]: That island has been in the design.

436
00:33:37,055 --> 00:33:47,164
[SPEAKER_12]: The purpose of the island is to allow a place for a pedestrian to have refuge during the crossing and to shorten the lengths of the crossing through traffic, so it is a pedestrian improvement.

437
00:33:47,904 --> 00:33:52,168
[SPEAKER_12]: So like I said, I was unaware of this potential issue, so we will look into it.

438
00:33:54,581 --> 00:33:58,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, just some of the things going on.

439
00:33:58,262 --> 00:34:11,026
[SPEAKER_12]: The decision to have that there was a design decision by the designers and one of the interests of the project was to improve pedestrian safety so it was considered a positive element in that regard.

440
00:34:11,286 --> 00:34:14,007
[SPEAKER_12]: So, and then it went through full design through MassDOT.

441
00:34:15,541 --> 00:34:30,028
[SPEAKER_02]: But with that being said, Mr. President, going back to what Councilor Marks and others have alluded to, the bike lane and the taking a property coming up high street and then getting to that intersection going down the hill, that seems to be have bypassed whatever was supposed to be done.

442
00:34:30,548 --> 00:34:35,291
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're asking for something now that this council has already voted on and there's been a change.

443
00:34:36,291 --> 00:34:41,634
[SPEAKER_02]: I get the impression that this council has not been advised of these changes and the bike route.

444
00:34:42,586 --> 00:34:48,187
[SPEAKER_02]: and the island that went there, because it appears that that island, I mean, you're talking about safety.

445
00:34:48,687 --> 00:34:55,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about the traffic safety before the, you already have a crosswalk right there at the corner of Hastings Lane going across.

446
00:34:56,069 --> 00:35:02,210
[SPEAKER_02]: And the island comes out a little bit more, it comes over in the area that's pushed out where, in front of the other island that's already there, that's gonna be gone.

447
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:09,792
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to take into consideration in the wintertime, buses coming down the street, heavy duty trucks, ambulances that have to get there.

448
00:35:10,652 --> 00:35:11,832
[SPEAKER_02]: You're looking at a serious,

449
00:35:12,587 --> 00:35:16,891
[SPEAKER_02]: vehicular emergency situation that's going to happen there.

450
00:35:16,991 --> 00:35:20,515
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would strongly suggest that that island can be removed.

451
00:35:20,555 --> 00:35:21,436
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be removed.

452
00:35:27,021 --> 00:35:29,784
[SPEAKER_05]: What does the city engineer say, Mr. President?

453
00:35:30,484 --> 00:35:31,966
[SPEAKER_05]: The chair recognizes Councilor Mux.

454
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:42,649
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what we're hearing, and I hear what Councilor Prentice stating, I think what we're hearing is a commitment from the city engineer and a commitment from the traffic engineer to take a look at this first thing tomorrow.

455
00:35:43,049 --> 00:35:48,214
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they deem it to be a safety concern, then naturally they'll address the safety concern.

456
00:35:48,234 --> 00:35:57,443
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't wanna put anything out there that we have to remove something or let's leave it to the experts and let's see what they say when they go out and take a look at it.

457
00:35:58,238 --> 00:36:04,002
[SPEAKER_08]: And I do believe that that was the initial motion that was made by Councilor Caraviello and seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

458
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:06,324
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna take those steps and report back to the council.

459
00:36:08,286 --> 00:36:14,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anybody else that has any questions relative to the issue at hand?

460
00:36:18,493 --> 00:36:19,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Hearing and seeing none.

461
00:36:22,516 --> 00:36:24,798
[SPEAKER_08]: On the main, let me see here, what do we have?

462
00:36:25,158 --> 00:36:25,999
[SPEAKER_08]: On the motion by,

463
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:43,268
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, on the first amendment made by Councilor Caraviello, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, that striping be considered in the form of thermoplastic materials.

464
00:36:45,389 --> 00:36:52,574
[SPEAKER_08]: So on the motion, on the paper, on the amendment.

465
00:36:55,035 --> 00:36:55,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

466
00:37:00,143 --> 00:37:00,603

00:37:09,845 --> 00:37:10,225
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

470
00:37:11,385 --> 00:37:11,625
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

471
00:37:19,927 --> 00:37:25,668
[SPEAKER_08]: On the amendment for report back from the city engineer in the traffic engineer relative to safety questions concerning the

472
00:37:27,419 --> 00:37:30,481
[SPEAKER_08]: traffic island at the corner of a winter of Hastings on high.

473
00:37:32,002 --> 00:37:37,386
[SPEAKER_08]: The main motion made by Councilor Caraviello seconded by Councilor Scarpelli, will the clerk please call the roll.

474
00:37:39,127 --> 00:37:39,427
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

475
00:37:40,969 --> 00:37:41,209
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

476
00:37:41,769 --> 00:37:42,009
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

477
00:37:42,349 --> 00:37:42,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

478
00:37:43,891 --> 00:37:44,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

479
00:37:47,233 --> 00:37:48,514
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

480
00:37:48,534 --> 00:37:55,158
[SPEAKER_08]: On the main motion is offered by Councilor Caraviello seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

481
00:37:59,555 --> 00:37:59,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

482
00:38:01,316 --> 00:38:01,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

483
00:38:02,837 --> 00:38:03,217
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

484
00:38:04,298 --> 00:38:04,518
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

485
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:06,079
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

486
00:38:06,379 --> 00:38:20,729
[SPEAKER_08]: Paper 21383 offered by Councilor Marks.

487
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:37,544
[SPEAKER_08]: be it resolved the city administration requests Eversource as part of their underground utility project, install new sidewalk and curbing on the even side of Winthrop Street from Wildwood Road to Placedead Road in the interest of public safety.

488
00:38:37,905 --> 00:38:39,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

489
00:38:40,606 --> 00:38:41,706
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

490
00:38:41,766 --> 00:38:50,869
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank all my colleagues for their work on behalf of the residents that are impacted by this Eversource project.

491
00:38:51,589 --> 00:38:52,970
[SPEAKER_05]: This project, Mr. President,

492
00:38:53,710 --> 00:38:57,853
[SPEAKER_05]: started in November 2014.

493
00:38:58,973 --> 00:39:22,868
[SPEAKER_05]: That's when initially Eversource presented to the mayor at the time their wishes to install an underground transmission line roughly 3.2 miles through the heart of the city of Medford, which involved saw cuts, excavation,

494
00:39:24,397 --> 00:39:32,641
[SPEAKER_05]: installation of pipe, backfill, temporary restoration, cable pulling, cable splicing, permanent restoration.

495
00:39:34,802 --> 00:39:36,102
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not it, Mr. President.

496
00:39:37,743 --> 00:39:54,150
[SPEAKER_05]: Residents in the area for the past two, well over two years, have to deal directly with vibration from the construction, with trenching that's being dug.

497
00:39:55,422 --> 00:39:57,123
[SPEAKER_05]: Excavating, Mr. President.

498
00:39:57,864 --> 00:39:59,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Heavy equipment noise.

499
00:40:01,046 --> 00:40:06,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Road plates that cling when you drive over them constantly.

500
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:10,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Dirt and debris in the air from the excavation.

501
00:40:12,834 --> 00:40:13,855
[SPEAKER_05]: Additional traffic.

502
00:40:15,476 --> 00:40:16,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Fumes.

503
00:40:17,558 --> 00:40:18,618
[SPEAKER_05]: Construction noise.

504
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,883
[SPEAKER_05]: And to top it off, as we all heard from residents,

505
00:40:26,058 --> 00:40:29,521
[SPEAKER_05]: countless sleepless nights, Mr. President.

506
00:40:29,962 --> 00:40:37,209
[SPEAKER_05]: We actually had residents that had to go to a hotel because they couldn't sleep, Mr. President.

507
00:40:37,589 --> 00:40:41,913
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how bad this construction got for residents in the area.

508
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:50,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, one would say, well, look, we're getting underground transmission line that's going to benefit the city.

509
00:40:52,444 --> 00:40:55,706
[SPEAKER_05]: There's zero truth to that, zero.

510
00:40:55,926 --> 00:40:59,968
[SPEAKER_05]: There is zero benefit from this project to the city of Medford.

511
00:41:01,489 --> 00:41:03,490
[SPEAKER_05]: This has zero benefit.

512
00:41:03,910 --> 00:41:07,552
[SPEAKER_05]: It has all the inconvenience and problems, Mr. President.

513
00:41:08,773 --> 00:41:21,120
[SPEAKER_05]: Putting that all aside, over the last two years during this construction, like I said, this process started in 2014 when we started to notify residents

514
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:33,286
[SPEAKER_05]: of potential hearings and what's going to happen, and they may not be able to get out of their driveway at certain times, and all the other stuff associated with construction that lasts for years, Mr. President.

515
00:41:34,526 --> 00:41:39,569
[SPEAKER_05]: The city, during this process, signed a memorandum of understanding.

516
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,931
[SPEAKER_05]: And I assume it was the mayor at the time.

517
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:47,033
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who else was in the room on behalf of the city.

518
00:41:47,533 --> 00:41:49,734
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was between the city and Eversource.

519
00:41:51,232 --> 00:42:04,783
[SPEAKER_05]: And the memorandum of understanding states that the city of Medford will receive a city field engineer to monitor work activities.

520
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:12,610
[SPEAKER_05]: So during this process, they were gonna pay for someone to monitor the activities.

521
00:42:13,602 --> 00:42:16,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Sounds like a regular construction site to me, Mr. President.

522
00:42:17,003 --> 00:42:22,325
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not sure if that was a win for the city, but it was part of the memorandum of understanding.

523
00:42:23,805 --> 00:42:25,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Curb to curb street restoration.

524
00:42:27,306 --> 00:42:36,789
[SPEAKER_05]: So imagine they came in and dug a three mile trench and then also put nine 12 by 12 cement vaults along the way.

525
00:42:37,629 --> 00:42:41,130
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can imagine the disruption and the digging and so forth.

526
00:42:42,796 --> 00:42:47,841
[SPEAKER_05]: And they decided that they are going to pave curb to curb when they're done.

527
00:42:48,422 --> 00:42:49,283
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that tremendous?

528
00:42:50,284 --> 00:42:53,708
[SPEAKER_05]: They dig up all the street, no benefit to the city, and guess what?

529
00:42:54,068 --> 00:42:56,070
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to get curb to curb restoration.

530
00:42:56,531 --> 00:42:57,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Yippee, Mr. President.

531
00:42:58,213 --> 00:42:58,493
[SPEAKER_05]: Yippee.

532
00:42:58,533 --> 00:43:04,039
[SPEAKER_05]: You can tell the residents after two years of construction in front of their home, they're getting a new street in front.

533
00:43:04,459 --> 00:43:04,800
[SPEAKER_05]: Yippee.

534
00:43:06,243 --> 00:43:08,364
[SPEAKER_05]: part of the memorandum of understanding.

535
00:43:09,065 --> 00:43:18,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Three ways crosswalks along the project route and a speed radar trailer for use during construction near Method High School.

536
00:43:19,411 --> 00:43:23,193
[SPEAKER_05]: For use, they didn't buy it for the city, although we could use one.

537
00:43:24,294 --> 00:43:27,256
[SPEAKER_05]: This is for use during the construction time.

538
00:43:27,936 --> 00:43:34,020
[SPEAKER_05]: How magnanimous of Eversource to provide a temporary speed radar trailer.

539
00:43:34,967 --> 00:43:40,129
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know why you need it in the area, because they're in such bad condition, the roads, you can't speed anyways.

540
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:49,052
[SPEAKER_05]: With the metal plates, the dirt, the debris, the tar, anyone that go up and down Winthrop Street can speak for that firsthand, Mr. President.

541
00:43:49,932 --> 00:43:55,154
[SPEAKER_05]: So in addition, the city also signed the following projects.

542
00:43:56,395 --> 00:44:02,477
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me just add, Mr. President, out of the 3.2 miles, Winthrop Street

543
00:44:03,692 --> 00:44:16,862
[SPEAKER_05]: had 6,400 feet, 1.2 miles of road, by far the largest residential construction site for this Eversource project, by far.

544
00:44:18,063 --> 00:44:31,953
[SPEAKER_05]: They were the ones, Mr. President, a lot of people were impacted from traffic, surrounding areas, I understand that, surrounding roads, but they were the ones, Mr. President, that felt the digging, that had the fumes, that had the construction in front of their homes.

545
00:44:34,266 --> 00:44:36,047
[SPEAKER_05]: And what else did they get, Mr. President?

546
00:44:37,368 --> 00:44:42,711
[SPEAKER_05]: The restoration of Winthrop Circle Rotary and high street sidewalks.

547
00:44:43,511 --> 00:44:45,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't say how many high street sidewalks.

548
00:44:47,713 --> 00:45:00,420
[SPEAKER_05]: Then, Mr. President, 50,000 for the installation of 220 linear feet of sidewalk curbs, curb ramps from Lorraine Road to Smith Lane.

549
00:45:01,283 --> 00:45:06,687
[SPEAKER_05]: We all know where that little stretch of road is, near the high school, across the street.

550
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:08,408
[SPEAKER_05]: 220 linear feet.

551
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:25,682
[SPEAKER_05]: And then rather than continue that, Mr. President, which makes sense, like we were just talking about paving the whole length of high street during the construction, right after that area, there are areas with no curb and no sidewalk.

552
00:45:27,903 --> 00:45:29,845
[SPEAKER_05]: So like putting a bike lane to nowhere,

553
00:45:30,696 --> 00:45:33,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's put a sidewalk that doesn't lead to another sidewalk.

554
00:45:36,659 --> 00:45:53,427
[SPEAKER_05]: So all the residents are asking, Mr. President, for all this disruption, all this noise, all this inconvenience for the past two years is to extend the sidewalk that they're doing from Lorain Road to Smith Lane to include Wildwood Road to Placeland Road.

555
00:45:53,867 --> 00:45:54,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Finish it off.

556
00:45:55,048 --> 00:45:57,829
[SPEAKER_05]: Make it a complete sidewalk, complete curbing.

557
00:45:58,850 --> 00:46:01,592
[SPEAKER_05]: make it so pedestrian safety comes first.

558
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:04,895
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a small price to pay.

559
00:46:05,456 --> 00:46:11,781
[SPEAKER_05]: They're saying the cost for 220 linear feet is $50,000 from Lorain Road to Smith.

560
00:46:12,862 --> 00:46:15,865
[SPEAKER_05]: That's double it to $100,000 to go to Placeton.

561
00:46:16,345 --> 00:46:20,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Even if you have to triple it, Mr. President, to $150,000.

562
00:46:20,549 --> 00:46:21,509
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a small price to pay.

563
00:46:27,345 --> 00:46:34,330
[SPEAKER_05]: And we paid a large price as residents, as inconvenience, as traffic, as debris, as equipment left on the roads.

564
00:46:36,012 --> 00:46:36,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Vibration.

565
00:46:37,172 --> 00:46:39,594
[SPEAKER_05]: We all got the calls when homes started to shake.

566
00:46:39,814 --> 00:46:40,415
[SPEAKER_05]: What do I do?

567
00:46:43,677 --> 00:46:48,041
[SPEAKER_05]: So I respectfully ask, Mr. President, this contract is still ongoing.

568
00:46:48,861 --> 00:46:53,825
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other part that I just read was in addition to the original MOU,

569
00:46:56,286 --> 00:46:59,167
[SPEAKER_05]: that provided for the sidewalk and the rotary.

570
00:47:00,007 --> 00:47:24,372
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would ask, Mr. President, respectfully, and I'm gonna offer a motion tonight, on behalf of the residents of Winthrop Street, that we continue the sidewalk and install new sidewalk, curbing, curb ramps along the even side of Winthrop Street, from Wildwood Road to Placelet Road, which continues

571
00:47:24,963 --> 00:47:30,066
[SPEAKER_05]: from Lorraine Road to Smith Lane, Mr. President, in the interest of public safety.

572
00:47:30,386 --> 00:47:37,249
[SPEAKER_05]: We may have some residents that are on tonight, and I would ask if you can indulge them, Mr. President, as well.

573
00:47:37,309 --> 00:47:37,689
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

574
00:47:39,930 --> 00:47:40,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. President.

575
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:43,152
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, thank you, Council Marks.

576
00:47:43,212 --> 00:47:52,857
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, another issue that when we reviewed this, to be honest with you, I thought with the discussions that this

577
00:47:54,218 --> 00:47:57,420
[SPEAKER_04]: the sidewalk was to go all the way to place it.

578
00:47:58,241 --> 00:48:05,486
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, your due diligence and making sure that we're protecting our residents.

579
00:48:05,546 --> 00:48:12,972
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we're at a point right now, another concern as you so eloquently stated, it's going nowhere.

580
00:48:13,092 --> 00:48:14,533
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's give an example.

581
00:48:14,993 --> 00:48:21,378
[SPEAKER_04]: You have Mr. Jones taking Mrs. Jones out on her walk and she's in a wheelchair.

582
00:48:22,122 --> 00:48:30,285
[SPEAKER_04]: you traverse that area, when you get to that part of the street, it's a huge concern for public safety.

583
00:48:30,905 --> 00:48:50,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that we need to push Eversource in this project, but if we're not gonna see that happen, and because we've seen them dig their heels in, I think we really also need to get for a backup plan, ask the city administration and the city engineer to maybe look into

584
00:48:51,643 --> 00:48:51,763
[SPEAKER_04]: that.

585
00:48:51,783 --> 00:49:03,566
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to continue in that and seeing if it could be done either in house or as, um, uh, possible the city because I it's that's that's it's.

586
00:49:04,647 --> 00:49:12,349
[SPEAKER_04]: Inexcusable to keep doing to not have that to the end of place that and that and leaving that that, uh, that opening.

587
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:14,249
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just it's just not safe at all.

588
00:49:14,609 --> 00:49:14,809
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's

589
00:49:21,781 --> 00:49:24,222
[SPEAKER_04]: where there were no sidewalks.

590
00:49:24,402 --> 00:49:28,523
[SPEAKER_04]: So to hear that it's stopping there is a disgrace.

591
00:49:28,563 --> 00:49:32,444
[SPEAKER_04]: So I appreciate you bringing this up again, Councilor Marks, and I will second that resolution.

592
00:49:33,185 --> 00:49:33,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

593
00:49:33,605 --> 00:49:34,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Best.

594
00:49:34,745 --> 00:49:35,725
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

595
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:37,766
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Marks and Councilor Scarpelli.

596
00:49:38,566 --> 00:49:43,408
[SPEAKER_07]: I fully support the sidewalk extension and always think it's important to remember

597
00:49:44,105 --> 00:49:48,267
[SPEAKER_07]: that this public utility made $1.2 billion in profit last year.

598
00:49:48,767 --> 00:49:52,449
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that they can give back to this community and have more than enough funds to do so.

599
00:49:53,289 --> 00:49:57,071
[SPEAKER_07]: I do have a question for the city engineer if he is still on the call.

600
00:50:03,014 --> 00:50:04,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Is the city engineer still on?

601
00:50:14,732 --> 00:50:15,012
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm here.

602
00:50:16,334 --> 00:50:16,634
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

603
00:50:18,717 --> 00:50:20,519
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. I haven't asked it yet.

604
00:50:20,739 --> 00:50:26,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, question for you, Tim, uh, regarding the timing on this whole project.

605
00:50:26,545 --> 00:50:33,473
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we discussed several weeks ago, um, around trying to accelerate the project, specifically the

606
00:50:34,072 --> 00:50:38,616
[SPEAKER_07]: paving on Mystic Avenue, paving on South Street, these areas that could be repaved.

607
00:50:39,016 --> 00:50:41,979
[SPEAKER_07]: Has there been any progress on making sure that that's done this season?

608
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:51,107
[SPEAKER_07]: I think as everyone is well aware, Mystic Avenue is a disaster in terms of road condition and South Street isn't too far behind.

609
00:50:51,207 --> 00:50:54,350
[SPEAKER_07]: So are we moving forward with that?

610
00:50:58,348 --> 00:50:59,288
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, thank you, Councilors.

611
00:50:59,768 --> 00:51:00,848
[SPEAKER_12]: We are moving forward with that.

612
00:51:01,109 --> 00:51:12,690
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have put the request in, as you know, to accelerate the resurfacing of Mystic Avenue and South Street, because those two portions of the project are complete, at least they're ready to be restored.

613
00:51:14,431 --> 00:51:17,151
[SPEAKER_12]: So we don't have a set timing on that yet.

614
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:23,972
[SPEAKER_12]: In the meantime, so you probably saw maybe some crews out there recently, we're having them repair the trench work that's out there.

615
00:51:24,572 --> 00:51:27,773
[SPEAKER_12]: Even that's starting to get a little old now, so we need to

616
00:51:28,354 --> 00:51:29,875
[SPEAKER_12]: repair that as well.

617
00:51:29,975 --> 00:51:32,577
[SPEAKER_12]: I think everybody understands the conditions of Mystic Avenue.

618
00:51:32,997 --> 00:51:37,059
[SPEAKER_12]: So while, you know, obviously while this project is delaying, Mystic Avenue continues to fall apart.

619
00:51:37,179 --> 00:51:42,803
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is the goal right now is to have the trenches repaired.

620
00:51:42,963 --> 00:51:50,407
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the meantime, at the end of the year, end of the construction season, have them repave Mystic Avenue, the city's portion of it and South Street too.

621
00:51:50,868 --> 00:51:52,369
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is the plan.

622
00:51:54,430 --> 00:51:54,730
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

623
00:51:57,215 --> 00:51:57,996
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

624
00:51:58,236 --> 00:52:01,538
[SPEAKER_11]: I also want to thank Councilor Mark for his board and his due diligence.

625
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:02,779
[SPEAKER_11]: I like Councilor Scarpelli.

626
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:08,663
[SPEAKER_11]: I obviously wasn't on the council at the time, but it was my understanding as a resident that the sidewalk would be continued the whole way.

627
00:52:08,703 --> 00:52:11,105
[SPEAKER_11]: So I really appreciate Councilor Mark's pointing that out.

628
00:52:12,105 --> 00:52:21,312
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the issue here is too that because of these promises from Eversource and also I believe there's the project on Winthrop Street, the giant pool,

629
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:25,973
[SPEAKER_11]: has also, you know, there's been some promise that they will do the sidewalk.

630
00:52:26,193 --> 00:52:28,634
[SPEAKER_11]: Because of this, we're lacking sidewalk in perpetuity.

631
00:52:28,674 --> 00:52:33,375
[SPEAKER_11]: We keep on being told, we're not going to handle it as a city because XYZ is going to handle it.

632
00:52:33,816 --> 00:52:41,738
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're going on several years now of a very obvious dangerous situation that we have no date in sight when this is actually going to be done.

633
00:52:42,578 --> 00:52:45,739
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wish I wish what Council Marks was saying was true.

634
00:52:45,759 --> 00:52:48,060
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it is true sometimes that people do slow down the area.

635
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:49,341
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of times they don't.

636
00:52:50,221 --> 00:52:51,601
[SPEAKER_11]: They're also trying to avoid the plates.

637
00:52:51,942 --> 00:53:00,925
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have areas where maybe there's sidewalk but there's not appropriate curbing and your cars that are kind of driving you know zigzagging around the plates and it's just incredibly dangerous.

638
00:53:02,058 --> 00:53:17,566
[SPEAKER_11]: So I really think Councilor Marks for bringing this up and really staying on this because this is a major issue in our community and something that, you know, we've been promised a safety update that the finish line just keeps on moving and it's unclear when it's ever going to be made safe for residents.

639
00:53:17,626 --> 00:53:18,967
[SPEAKER_11]: So I fully support the resolution.

640
00:53:19,287 --> 00:53:19,628
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

641
00:53:20,228 --> 00:53:21,589
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor Morocco.

642
00:53:22,169 --> 00:53:22,989
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. President.

643
00:53:23,029 --> 00:53:27,852
[SPEAKER_10]: I also want to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward and thank all my council colleagues for the comments that they've made.

644
00:53:28,827 --> 00:53:33,629
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been on that council now, this is my sixth year, and we have been talking about this project since day one.

645
00:53:34,449 --> 00:53:40,651
[SPEAKER_10]: And the residents of Winthrop Street have had to put up with far too much with regard to this project.

646
00:53:40,671 --> 00:53:44,092
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a public safety issue.

647
00:53:44,112 --> 00:53:46,873
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a quality of life issue.

648
00:53:47,913 --> 00:53:52,175
[SPEAKER_10]: You're in plates clanging all day as cars are going up and down Winthrop Street.

649
00:53:52,835 --> 00:53:55,996
[SPEAKER_10]: The dirt that Councilor Marks mentioned, this is ridiculous.

650
00:53:57,104 --> 00:53:59,185
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like, this is like the project that will never end.

651
00:54:00,426 --> 00:54:02,387
[SPEAKER_10]: And it needs to end soon.

652
00:54:02,407 --> 00:54:11,372
[SPEAKER_10]: I know at one point in time, I think it was during one of our meetings, probably about a month or two months ago, we had Eversource on the line with us.

653
00:54:11,492 --> 00:54:15,714
[SPEAKER_10]: And they had mentioned that at that time, I think there was one crew working.

654
00:54:16,895 --> 00:54:21,998
[SPEAKER_10]: Can City Engineer give us an update as to whether or not that has been increased?

655
00:54:22,758 --> 00:54:24,079
[SPEAKER_22]: I sure recognize it's not to be given.

656
00:54:27,257 --> 00:54:27,457
[SPEAKER_22]: Tim.

657
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:31,739
[SPEAKER_22]: Hold on.

658
00:54:31,759 --> 00:54:32,420
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, I'm unmuted.

659
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:33,420
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

660
00:54:34,801 --> 00:54:37,002
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, Councilor Falco, could you repeat the question one more time?

661
00:54:38,163 --> 00:54:50,649
[SPEAKER_10]: Last time we met with Eversource, I believe they mentioned that the time there was one crew working on the project or working on Winthrop Street, and it had something to do with the police detail availability.

662
00:54:51,029 --> 00:54:53,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you just give us an update as to whether or not that has changed?

663
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:56,612
[SPEAKER_10]: Are there more crews working on the project?

664
00:54:57,507 --> 00:54:58,127
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, absolutely.

665
00:54:58,907 --> 00:55:16,771
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, it was not just details it was the opinion that of the Medford Police Department and the chief that having all the crews strung out on winter street and the other projects going on in this in the city like the high street project created a traffic safety problem public safety problem so that was really the root of that.

666
00:55:17,211 --> 00:55:19,992
[SPEAKER_12]: However, in light of that, we did schedule.

667
00:55:21,312 --> 00:55:25,415
[SPEAKER_12]: meetings every three weeks on site to review the field conditions and what was going on.

668
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:37,602
[SPEAKER_12]: So as of Friday, we have given the green light to a third crew that will be starting at the area of the community gardens, the DCR property, and will be moving north on Winthrop Street.

669
00:55:38,643 --> 00:55:43,846
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's kind of a crux of the project through that intersection, so they're going to get going on that.

670
00:55:45,487 --> 00:55:52,429
[SPEAKER_12]: So yes, the answer is yes, they're going to be three crews on Winthrop Street as of Monday.

671
00:55:52,449 --> 00:56:02,031
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, you know, when we try to talk about the schedule of this project, it's been difficult without knowing how many crews are active in the city.

672
00:56:02,071 --> 00:56:06,572
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, the last look ahead I received from Eversource

673
00:56:08,172 --> 00:56:12,394
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, showed this work starting next week with all the other crews happening.

674
00:56:13,015 --> 00:56:17,717
[SPEAKER_12]: And, you know, it does kind of have more meat on the bone, so to speak.

675
00:56:17,777 --> 00:56:23,200
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, hopefully having this amount of activity will bring the finish line closer.

676
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:29,664
[SPEAKER_12]: So obviously if, you know, if the city could let them work 24 seven, they would finish, you know, as quick as possible.

677
00:56:29,704 --> 00:56:30,644
[SPEAKER_12]: We can't do that either.

678
00:56:30,744 --> 00:56:35,587
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a balance and I think we're getting close to it for the rest of the construction season.

679
00:56:35,607 --> 00:56:36,988
[SPEAKER_12]: So hopefully that answers your question.

680
00:56:38,203 --> 00:56:50,109
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Giver, and I definitely, it's good news that we're having additional crews working on the project, but just going back to the original point, you know, it is a public safety issue.

681
00:56:50,229 --> 00:56:51,750
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a quality of life issue.

682
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:53,630
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we're going to do it, we should be doing it right.

683
00:56:54,091 --> 00:56:59,393
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we're going to be ripping up the road, then we should be continuing the sidewalk all the way to place that road.

684
00:56:59,934 --> 00:57:01,834
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm definitely in support of this resolution.

685
00:57:01,874 --> 00:57:03,695
[SPEAKER_10]: I thank Councilor Marks for bringing this forward.

686
00:57:04,236 --> 00:57:04,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

687
00:57:07,687 --> 00:57:08,948
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

688
00:57:08,988 --> 00:57:11,670
[SPEAKER_08]: And I thank Councilor Marks for giving us a great history on this project.

689
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:19,995
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think it's important that we also look back and think about what's been going on in this stretch for the better part of a decade now.

690
00:57:21,135 --> 00:57:26,979
[SPEAKER_08]: We had an underground utility project going on there from the MWRA that went up Winthrop Street.

691
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:28,440
[SPEAKER_08]: That took about three years.

692
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:33,703
[SPEAKER_08]: And part of that project included some work that went underneath the Winthrop Street Rotary.

693
00:57:34,263 --> 00:57:36,885
[SPEAKER_08]: And when they restored the Rotary, they restored it improperly.

694
00:57:37,590 --> 00:57:45,916
[SPEAKER_08]: So part of the mitigation of this project is actually, Eberstrom is fixing the project, fixing the mistake that the MWI made in the restoration.

695
00:57:46,476 --> 00:57:51,600
[SPEAKER_08]: So for two and a half years, that stretch was under construction.

696
00:57:52,300 --> 00:58:02,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Then once that project, that underground, that water project finished, what happened was this little project over here, they call it the Craddock Bridge project.

697
00:58:02,747 --> 00:58:06,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Three years, Mr. President, where all the traffic that was supposed to go over that bridge

698
00:58:07,489 --> 00:58:09,930
[SPEAKER_08]: was detoured up Winthrop Street to Winthrop Street Rotary.

699
00:58:12,252 --> 00:58:17,334
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear the day the Craddock Bridge project ended, the day, that's when they started this project.

700
00:58:18,115 --> 00:58:26,500
[SPEAKER_08]: This stretch of road has been under construction or under part of a traffic management plan in one way, shape or form for the better part of 10 years.

701
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:29,361
[SPEAKER_08]: 10 years, Mr. President, that's not right.

702
00:58:29,841 --> 00:58:30,562
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not right.

703
00:58:31,202 --> 00:58:34,444
[SPEAKER_08]: So this should be a project that should have been completed by now

704
00:58:35,367 --> 00:58:40,271
[SPEAKER_08]: when they sold us the bill of goods, when we granted the locations, they said it will be completed by now.

705
00:58:40,731 --> 00:58:45,375
[SPEAKER_08]: So I share Councilor Mack's frustration with the process and with what's going on.

706
00:58:46,856 --> 00:58:57,604
[SPEAKER_08]: I also have a question for the city engineer because it's been brought up that all our roadways are gonna be restored curb to curb and that we're gonna prioritize the curb to curb resurfacing of Mystic Gap, if I understood that correctly.

707
00:58:57,944 --> 00:58:58,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Am I correct with that?

708
00:58:58,965 --> 00:59:01,146
[SPEAKER_08]: That Mystic Gap will be resurfaced curb to curb as well?

709
00:59:01,867 --> 00:59:04,629
[SPEAKER_08]: So they say, I just drove down Mystic Gap and it looks like

710
00:59:05,033 --> 00:59:11,194
[SPEAKER_08]: The paint truck exploded and we have a whole brand new lane painted red all the way down.

711
00:59:11,734 --> 00:59:13,675
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Gabb going southbound into the city.

712
00:59:14,355 --> 00:59:16,055
[SPEAKER_08]: So what's going to happen with that?

713
00:59:16,195 --> 00:59:21,216
[SPEAKER_08]: If the roadway is going to be resurfaced curb to curb, and it's going to be restored in time.

714
00:59:21,916 --> 00:59:22,957
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm confused by this.

715
00:59:23,937 --> 00:59:26,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any coordination going on between these projects at all?

716
00:59:27,057 --> 00:59:30,438
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, can the city engineer answer that question for me, please address that.

717
00:59:31,008 --> 00:59:35,531
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we just spent an inordinate amount of money that I believe Rep.

718
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:42,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Barber was able to secure in the state budget for this transportation initiative on Mystic Gap, and they implemented it.

719
00:59:42,835 --> 00:59:55,243
[SPEAKER_08]: But they implemented it without coordinating the resurfacing of the roadway, which is something that I anticipate will happen towards the conclusion of this Eversource project if we don't get our ducks in a row.

720
00:59:55,603 --> 00:59:58,505
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm hoping the city engineer can speak on that a little bit, Mr. President.

721
01:00:01,898 --> 01:00:02,138
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

722
01:00:02,478 --> 01:00:03,139
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Knight.

723
01:00:03,979 --> 01:00:07,301
[SPEAKER_12]: So they were coordinated the best that they could be coordinated.

724
01:00:07,742 --> 01:00:16,667
[SPEAKER_12]: So the bus lane pilot project, there was a window of opportunity with the grant and the coordination with Somerville, and it is just paint.

725
01:00:17,127 --> 01:00:27,834
[SPEAKER_12]: So when the milling and overlay of Mystic Avenue happens or it rebuilds, it will go back to the bus lane if the state thinks that it was a successful pilot project.

726
01:00:27,914 --> 01:00:30,776
[SPEAKER_12]: If they think it was not successful, then it wouldn't go back.

727
01:00:31,456 --> 01:00:32,476
[SPEAKER_12]: it would go back to the way it was.

728
01:00:33,617 --> 01:00:35,037
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's my understanding of it.

729
01:00:35,077 --> 01:00:38,499
[SPEAKER_12]: So they did paint a road that needs to be paved, certainly.

730
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:41,360
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's a pilot project with paint.

731
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:49,743
[SPEAKER_12]: So from the infrastructure world, it's seen as acceptable to do that, even though there is an investment there with the paint.

732
01:00:50,323 --> 01:01:00,667
[SPEAKER_12]: But when curb-to-curb happens on a road like that, and they put it back the way it was, they would put that bus lane back the way it was, again, if the state decided it was a successful pilot project at that time.

733
01:01:01,447 --> 01:01:02,228
[SPEAKER_12]: and they wanted it back.

734
01:01:02,768 --> 01:01:04,069
[SPEAKER_12]: So hopefully that answers your question.

735
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:11,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, if the goal is to fast track that stretch, then how are they going to be able to gauge whether or not the pilot project works?

736
01:01:11,734 --> 01:01:19,620
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, if we get the green light to fast track that stretch repaving because that work is done in that roadway, how long are they going to be able to examine the data from this pilot project?

737
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:22,101
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I don't know exactly how long it's going to last.

738
01:01:22,341 --> 01:01:24,443
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have that information in front of me, but I can get it to you.

739
01:01:24,483 --> 01:01:29,026
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, the pilot project lasts for a certain amount of time and they need enough data in order to make a decision.

740
01:01:29,367 --> 01:01:37,332
[SPEAKER_12]: So if the timing of that doesn't work out, then it gets painted back as the pilot project, the way it is, the way you see it today, when the curve to curve is done.

741
01:01:38,633 --> 01:01:41,295
[SPEAKER_12]: So it would just continue, the pilot project would continue at that point.

742
01:01:41,335 --> 01:01:45,477
[SPEAKER_12]: So I was just saying that as a cap, if the state for some reason said, you know what, this is just not working.

743
01:01:45,497 --> 01:01:49,059
[SPEAKER_12]: You guys, you know, Eversource is repaving that road, don't put it back the way it was.

744
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,761
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, I don't think that the timing would line up that way.

745
01:01:53,661 --> 01:02:01,165
[SPEAKER_08]: And I just see it as extremely wasteful that they put the paint down on the road, knowing that it's going to be milled and resurfaced.

746
01:02:01,925 --> 01:02:06,808
[SPEAKER_08]: And then who's responsible for restoring it back to the in-kind situation, it will be National Grid, correct?

747
01:02:07,943 --> 01:02:14,506
[SPEAKER_12]: I for that it would be ever source so when we give ever source a striping plan it will have the bustling on it.

748
01:02:15,367 --> 01:02:21,750
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, so it seems like a waste it does but it does happen all the time paints ground off and put back.

749
01:02:22,450 --> 01:02:30,414
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree it is, you know, it is a waste if we could have done it a better way we could have but that's, those are the cards that were dealt with a delta was for the situation.

750
01:02:30,734 --> 01:02:30,834
[SPEAKER_12]: So,

751
01:02:34,249 --> 01:02:34,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

752
01:02:34,989 --> 01:02:38,451
[SPEAKER_11]: I just have one question for the city engineer, if I could, through the chair.

753
01:02:38,471 --> 01:02:48,056
[SPEAKER_11]: Does the city, so I mean, the hope is that Eversource is going to meet the council's and residents' demands about the sidewalk extension, completing it to place that.

754
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:54,119
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'm curious, does the city have a contingency plan or a plan for the sidewalk portion?

755
01:02:54,219 --> 01:02:54,599
[SPEAKER_11]: Is it met?

756
01:02:54,619 --> 01:03:01,402
[SPEAKER_11]: We're talking about one of the busiest thoroughfares in the city that a lot of people are walking down or trying to move down as well.

757
01:03:01,422 --> 01:03:02,843
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm curious if there's a city plan

758
01:03:03,723 --> 01:03:07,967
[SPEAKER_11]: to make up that missing sidewalk if these companies don't.

759
01:03:10,489 --> 01:03:10,649
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep.

760
01:03:11,770 --> 01:03:15,994
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, there isn't there isn't a plan right now a customer all the doesn't exist.

761
01:03:16,935 --> 01:03:18,416
[SPEAKER_12]: We do have the.

762
01:03:20,102 --> 01:03:24,443
[SPEAKER_12]: contractor for that 220 feet of sidewalk we do have them lined up.

763
01:03:25,223 --> 01:03:34,986
[SPEAKER_12]: So if the city administration were to get sort of a renegotiation of that number and extended the place said, you know, that would be the easiest way to do it it's this unit prices and we would just extend it down.

764
01:03:35,006 --> 01:03:38,367
[SPEAKER_12]: However, I just do want to clarify one thing.

765
01:03:39,487 --> 01:03:49,673
[SPEAKER_12]: The, the new sidewalk that's going in the 220 feet that Councilmarks referred to is connecting basically a portion of winter street that has no sidewalk.

766
01:03:50,173 --> 01:03:59,398
[SPEAKER_12]: So it is connecting to a sidewalk, it's a bad sidewalk it's not in good shape, but it is there, it's a four foot wide asphalt side sidewalk in poor shape that runs up to, I believe close to place that if not place

767
01:04:00,118 --> 01:04:02,480
[SPEAKER_12]: But it doesn't have a curb or anything like that.

768
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:05,042
[SPEAKER_12]: So I understand that folks wanted to extend it.

769
01:04:05,162 --> 01:04:09,826
[SPEAKER_12]: I do not know why Winthrop Street was built that way originally and why they didn't put sidewalks on both sides.

770
01:04:09,966 --> 01:04:10,586
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know why.

771
01:04:11,767 --> 01:04:23,115
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, if for some reason that can't happen or if a source refuses or whatever, something doesn't happen with extending it, it would be something that the city would be looking into because it is a connection.

772
01:04:24,016 --> 01:04:29,180
[SPEAKER_12]: And one of the complete streets project on our priority list is the Playstead intersection, I believe.

773
01:04:29,580 --> 01:04:30,481
[SPEAKER_12]: If not, I think it should be.

774
01:04:30,501 --> 01:04:32,483
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope I didn't speak incorrectly on that.

775
01:04:32,863 --> 01:04:39,490
[SPEAKER_12]: Which if we were to redo that whole intersection and the geometry of it, we would obviously take that into consideration, but that would be multiple years off.

776
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:43,053
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, hopefully that answers your question for you.

777
01:04:43,634 --> 01:04:44,955
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing necessarily on the books today.

778
01:04:45,816 --> 01:04:46,596
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, yes, it does.

779
01:04:46,657 --> 01:04:47,017
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

780
01:04:48,138 --> 01:04:50,080
[SPEAKER_22]: Tim, if I can make an observation for you.

781
01:04:50,580 --> 01:04:52,202
[SPEAKER_22]: Tim, I'll challenge you to

782
01:04:53,313 --> 01:05:03,562
[SPEAKER_22]: go across the method line into Winchester, and once you look at the quality of construction and repair of their roads, compared to how our construction is done.

783
01:05:03,843 --> 01:05:13,091
[SPEAKER_22]: And you go by and you see all the, yes, they have the plates down there, but all their plates are all hocked on, they're nice and tight, so they don't have the clanging.

784
01:05:13,611 --> 01:05:15,573
[SPEAKER_22]: And when you see the repairs, they're nice and straight.

785
01:05:16,283 --> 01:05:17,566
[SPEAKER_22]: and nicely paid.

786
01:05:18,227 --> 01:05:21,093
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know if it's if it's the same construction company doing that.

787
01:05:22,215 --> 01:05:26,083
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the guy work is you know, Tim,

788
01:05:27,075 --> 01:05:28,396
[SPEAKER_12]: It is not the same company.

789
01:05:29,236 --> 01:05:30,897
[SPEAKER_12]: I have looked at that.

790
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:32,858
[SPEAKER_12]: The alignments are different.

791
01:05:33,158 --> 01:05:44,384
[SPEAKER_12]: The unfortunate situation, the plates, I don't think are there anymore, but at that stretch of Winthrop Street with the curve and the way the plates lined up, we did ultimately have them asphalt down the plates for the last couple of weeks.

792
01:05:45,865 --> 01:05:53,509
[SPEAKER_12]: We did work quite diligently with McCourt, the construction company, engineering division, DPW, even police to try to figure out ways

793
01:05:54,169 --> 01:05:55,630
[SPEAKER_12]: to reduce the plate noise.

794
01:05:56,330 --> 01:06:01,653
[SPEAKER_12]: The last option was welding them together, but when you weld them together, then you can't actually work under there.

795
01:06:01,713 --> 01:06:07,816
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm very grateful that the residents were patient through that whole ordeal.

796
01:06:07,876 --> 01:06:09,837
[SPEAKER_12]: The geometry was part of it.

797
01:06:09,897 --> 01:06:12,098
[SPEAKER_12]: As you noticed, the plates didn't line up.

798
01:06:12,118 --> 01:06:16,280
[SPEAKER_12]: In Winchester, they were able to line up more, and it was a different construction company.

799
01:06:16,320 --> 01:06:18,882
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's Middlesex Construction as opposed to McCourt.

800
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:21,063
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm not going to

801
01:06:22,324 --> 01:06:25,026
[SPEAKER_12]: you can see the differences in places, I believe.

802
01:06:25,046 --> 01:06:29,349
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, we, so hopefully.

803
01:06:29,369 --> 01:06:36,074
[SPEAKER_22]: Shame on whoever bid this contract to let a different city get the higher quality work than we got in Medford.

804
01:06:36,394 --> 01:06:38,436
[SPEAKER_22]: We got the low-end contractor.

805
01:06:39,177 --> 01:06:42,339
[SPEAKER_22]: This is the second one, because the first one bailed out of the project.

806
01:06:42,639 --> 01:06:48,524
[SPEAKER_22]: And you can tell by the quality work that's been done throughout the city on this entire project for the last four, five, six years.

807
01:06:49,184 --> 01:06:51,286
[SPEAKER_22]: We should be ashamed of ourselves for letting this happen.

808
01:06:53,227 --> 01:06:55,048
[SPEAKER_22]: We have some people that want to speak in this.

809
01:06:55,128 --> 01:06:56,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, name and address of the record.

810
01:06:57,589 --> 01:06:58,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Giglio, Winthrop Street.

811
01:06:59,409 --> 01:07:02,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Councilor Marks and the rest of the council for bringing this up consistently.

812
01:07:02,731 --> 01:07:04,011
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate it.

813
01:07:04,331 --> 01:07:05,752
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm right in the middle of this project.

814
01:07:06,712 --> 01:07:12,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Since two years ago, when they had the Jersey barriers right in front of my house, I would have to do a three point turn just to get out of my driveway.

815
01:07:13,455 --> 01:07:16,736
[SPEAKER_03]: At the time, my son just got his license coming down the street.

816
01:07:16,796 --> 01:07:21,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Now he, unfortunately, because he was a new driver, he hit that Jersey barriers many times.

817
01:07:23,183 --> 01:07:31,408
[SPEAKER_03]: that they're gone, they took the curbing, which I believe I've sent to a lot of you guys, threw it across the street, and it's just thrown there.

818
01:07:31,448 --> 01:07:33,629
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not placed, it's thrown there every which way.

819
01:07:33,649 --> 01:07:35,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Some go this way, some go this way.

820
01:07:35,330 --> 01:07:41,413
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also a black and white cement bowl that was dug up previously, and it's just thrown there.

821
01:07:41,513 --> 01:07:44,615
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been there for two years now, I wanna say.

822
01:07:45,056 --> 01:07:48,798
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that the plates are there, that's all we hear all night is the clink, clink, clink.

823
01:07:49,558 --> 01:07:52,760
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a five-year-old, major sensory issues,

824
01:07:53,108 --> 01:07:54,509
[SPEAKER_03]: She wakes up all night long.

825
01:07:54,929 --> 01:07:56,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, that's what I sleep.

826
01:07:56,410 --> 01:07:56,710
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

827
01:07:57,230 --> 01:07:57,731
[SPEAKER_03]: She doesn't.

828
01:07:58,111 --> 01:08:00,132
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, you know, her bedrooms in the front.

829
01:08:00,732 --> 01:08:01,653
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already painted pink.

830
01:08:01,873 --> 01:08:04,214
[SPEAKER_03]: She can't switch with my son.

831
01:08:04,655 --> 01:08:08,837
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to thank everyone here so much for staying on top of this.

832
01:08:08,897 --> 01:08:10,198
[SPEAKER_03]: I really, really appreciate it.

833
01:08:10,258 --> 01:08:10,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

834
01:08:10,878 --> 01:08:11,218
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

835
01:08:11,939 --> 01:08:16,782
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, anyone else want to speak on this on, uh, anyone else?

836
01:08:16,862 --> 01:08:17,842
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyone else want to speak?

837
01:08:20,103 --> 01:08:21,204
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't see anyone.

838
01:08:22,225 --> 01:08:22,525
[SPEAKER_22]: Uh, so

839
01:08:24,555 --> 01:08:26,056
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm sorry?

840
01:08:26,556 --> 01:08:28,316
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't see anyone with their hand up.

841
01:08:30,657 --> 01:08:31,637
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyone want to speak at home?

842
01:08:34,278 --> 01:08:39,279
[SPEAKER_22]: I see someone out there, iPad in the corner.

843
01:08:39,619 --> 01:08:44,160
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Clerk, if you can read, that looks like Mr. Karan, if you can unmute him, please.

844
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:46,180
[SPEAKER_22]: iPad.

845
01:08:48,981 --> 01:08:50,081
[SPEAKER_17]: This is Dennis Karan.

846
01:08:51,002 --> 01:08:52,382
[SPEAKER_22]: Dennis, name and address of the record, please.

847
01:08:53,076 --> 01:08:56,238
[SPEAKER_17]: That's Dennis Kerr on 578 Winthrop Street, thank you.

848
01:08:59,381 --> 01:09:03,924
[SPEAKER_17]: I would like also to thank Councilor Marks for bringing this to tonight's agenda.

849
01:09:05,165 --> 01:09:11,290
[SPEAKER_17]: With such passion, it's not easy to follow someone who's so passionate, much less someone named Socrates.

850
01:09:12,611 --> 01:09:22,538
[SPEAKER_17]: But you all in this very serious and sober discussion tonight, expressing your concern for our situation,

851
01:09:23,052 --> 01:09:26,455
[SPEAKER_17]: make me thankful to be a resident, a 40 year resident.

852
01:09:28,236 --> 01:09:32,399
[SPEAKER_17]: It is a safety issue as described by Councilor Marks.

853
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:48,051
[SPEAKER_17]: We have walkers and pedestrians all day long coming and going, including students in the public schools, the parochial schools, the bus stop is up the street here at the next corner for youngsters.

854
01:09:49,632 --> 01:09:57,837
[SPEAKER_17]: There are people with small children who walk up and down the, I can't call it a sidewalk, I call it an asphalt path.

855
01:09:59,158 --> 01:09:59,598
[SPEAKER_17]: Primitive.

856
01:10:00,418 --> 01:10:02,820
[SPEAKER_17]: They walk their children up and down this path.

857
01:10:03,981 --> 01:10:06,402
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm concerned because there is no curbing.

858
01:10:07,242 --> 01:10:12,205
[SPEAKER_17]: Drivers from anywhere will pull over to the side of the road to make a phone call.

859
01:10:12,766 --> 01:10:14,707
[SPEAKER_17]: Sometimes they leave their cars overnight.

860
01:10:16,008 --> 01:10:16,128
[SPEAKER_17]: And

861
01:10:17,562 --> 01:10:28,489
[SPEAKER_17]: I can see a car coming up on the sidewalk, which is where they settled for a little while and encounter one of these unwitting pedestrians, people who fall them.

862
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:39,537
[SPEAKER_17]: I for one, and I was very thankful that day that the Medford police, Medford fire, ambulance were there in five minutes to help me up.

863
01:10:41,418 --> 01:10:41,578
[SPEAKER_17]: So,

864
01:10:42,460 --> 01:10:43,861
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you again, all of you.

865
01:10:43,941 --> 01:10:49,303
[SPEAKER_17]: I know some of you have been out here to survey the situation personally, maybe some of you live in the neighborhood.

866
01:10:50,023 --> 01:10:52,944
[SPEAKER_17]: We do need the sidewalk, we do need the curbing.

867
01:10:53,765 --> 01:10:54,685
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you and good night.

868
01:10:55,946 --> 01:10:56,946
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

869
01:10:57,346 --> 01:10:58,527
[SPEAKER_22]: Marsha Kerwin, did you wanna speak?

870
01:11:00,727 --> 01:11:03,389
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Clerk, if you could unmute Marsha Kerwin, please.

871
01:11:10,131 --> 01:11:11,512
[SPEAKER_22]: Marsha, name and address of the record, please.

872
01:11:12,078 --> 01:11:15,239
[SPEAKER_00]: Marsha Karen, I also live at 578 Winthrop Street.

873
01:11:15,919 --> 01:11:29,763
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna thank all of you for all of the things that you have listed and thank Councilor Marks for all of the homework that he has done on this construction project.

874
01:11:30,764 --> 01:11:34,785
[SPEAKER_00]: It has been a great disruption to the neighborhood with the noise level.

875
01:11:35,105 --> 01:11:40,967
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the previous speakers also noted that all day long we hear clang, clang, clang.

876
01:11:42,274 --> 01:11:53,073
[SPEAKER_00]: In some places we do not because the workers are working so they have the orange cones, but as soon as they go home for the day, it starts and it ends about.

877
01:11:54,171 --> 01:12:02,538
[SPEAKER_00]: It lightens up around midnight and then begins again when the traffic comes down Winthrop Street at around 4.30 in the morning.

878
01:12:03,158 --> 01:12:05,240
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've spent many sleepless nights.

879
01:12:06,081 --> 01:12:11,825
[SPEAKER_00]: There's large equipment parked across our driveway so that it makes it difficult for us to get in and out.

880
01:12:12,526 --> 01:12:17,630
[SPEAKER_00]: The police have been extremely helpful with that part of it.

881
01:12:18,271 --> 01:12:20,733
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had the port-a-parties on our front lawn.

882
01:12:23,009 --> 01:12:25,350
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cracked some of my china.

883
01:12:25,490 --> 01:12:30,311
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the neighbors also told me that it has cracked some of their glasses.

884
01:12:31,172 --> 01:12:35,393
[SPEAKER_00]: There are students who walk along this so-called sidewalk.

885
01:12:36,433 --> 01:12:42,015
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually saw one waiting for the bus, maybe last week or the week before.

886
01:12:42,035 --> 01:12:46,116
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had his backpack all set to go until

887
01:12:47,051 --> 01:12:51,315
[SPEAKER_00]: The workers arrived and he ran off in the opposite direction of Medford High School.

888
01:12:51,755 --> 01:12:54,698
[SPEAKER_00]: I would guess he was probably about 14 years old.

889
01:12:57,681 --> 01:13:01,024
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a bus stop out in front, but

890
01:13:01,860 --> 01:13:09,326
[SPEAKER_00]: The curbing would also allow not only the sidewalk, but the curbing would allow for illegal parkers.

891
01:13:10,027 --> 01:13:17,333
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really urge you and encourage you to continue with this project and make it complete.

892
01:13:18,234 --> 01:13:24,940
[SPEAKER_00]: The area, I wanna address the area between the sidewalk and the street where the trees are planted.

893
01:13:25,920 --> 01:13:28,583
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was at one time grass.

894
01:13:29,987 --> 01:13:35,390
[SPEAKER_00]: It is now dirt where there have been plates placed on top of them.

895
01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:48,058
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whatever grass may have been there in some areas, not in all of the areas of that portion of Winthrop street, it's now just dirt.

896
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:49,259
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um,

897
01:13:52,125 --> 01:13:54,446
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it does need some attention.

898
01:13:54,646 --> 01:14:02,170
[SPEAKER_00]: We've lived here for over 40 years now, and this project has gone on for a long time.

899
01:14:02,310 --> 01:14:07,573
[SPEAKER_00]: So our frustration level is quite high, as you can imagine.

900
01:14:07,633 --> 01:14:15,377
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanna thank you for taking up this issue, and Councilor Marks, thank you for all that additional history that you noted in the beginning.

901
01:14:16,057 --> 01:14:16,877
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.

902
01:14:17,778 --> 01:14:18,418
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Marsha.

903
01:14:19,118 --> 01:14:20,099
[SPEAKER_22]: Christina Cassano.

904
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:36,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.

905
01:14:36,571 --> 01:14:42,995
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate all of you coming tonight and hearing all of us on Winthrop Street and hearing our concerns.

906
01:14:43,395 --> 01:14:44,295
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you hear me okay?

907
01:14:45,276 --> 01:14:46,857
[SPEAKER_22]: Christina, can we get your name and address please?

908
01:14:47,201 --> 01:14:51,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Christina Cassano, 572 Winthrop Street in Medford.

909
01:14:52,123 --> 01:14:53,984
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm here with my husband, Robert Cassano.

910
01:14:56,905 --> 01:14:57,605
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

911
01:14:58,185 --> 01:15:00,626
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm born and raised in Medford on Billings Ave.

912
01:15:00,666 --> 01:15:03,847
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've lived on Winthrop Street since 2015.

913
01:15:04,687 --> 01:15:06,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Have really loved living here.

914
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:14,251
[SPEAKER_01]: That said, obviously the project has been really disruptive to us and to everyone around us.

915
01:15:14,792 --> 01:15:19,254
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a two and a half year old daughter and her bedroom is at the front of the house.

916
01:15:19,394 --> 01:15:25,538
[SPEAKER_01]: And we put on three white noise machines in order to keep the noise out while she sleeps.

917
01:15:26,018 --> 01:15:38,184
[SPEAKER_01]: So while I appreciate that work is being done, it's been really difficult to kind of manage with the loud noise from the metal plates and just the construction trucks starting early in the morning.

918
01:15:38,804 --> 01:15:39,545
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really,

919
01:15:40,847 --> 01:15:49,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all for bringing this to everyone's attention and hopefully addressing it, because I think adding the sidewalks is a huge safety issue.

920
01:15:49,029 --> 01:15:59,291
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be great to add for all the high school students nearby, all the little kids in the area, all the elderly who are using the sidewalks, the bus stop, everything.

921
01:16:00,451 --> 01:16:02,091
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll pass it to my husband.

922
01:16:02,972 --> 01:16:08,833
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you again, Councilor Marks, for spearheading this issue.

923
01:16:10,175 --> 01:16:11,976
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been trying for five years now.

924
01:16:12,916 --> 01:16:19,478
[SPEAKER_18]: I've reached out to the mayor's office, engineers, and you know, it's never a promise kept here.

925
01:16:20,118 --> 01:16:21,298
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a little disappointing.

926
01:16:21,858 --> 01:16:29,240
[SPEAKER_18]: I have a pretty good construction background and it's just hard to see what happens.

927
01:16:29,320 --> 01:16:35,902
[SPEAKER_18]: And I agree with the other councilman about how things are done in Winchester and how things are done in Medford.

928
01:16:36,302 --> 01:16:38,363
[SPEAKER_18]: It's, you know, you literally go,

929
01:16:39,602 --> 01:16:47,546
[SPEAKER_18]: not even a minute, and you can see the quality of work, how it's less impactful to us.

930
01:16:50,007 --> 01:16:57,050
[SPEAKER_18]: We really like to see, as the project progresses, that there is more coordination.

931
01:16:58,371 --> 01:17:05,294
[SPEAKER_18]: There should be a project manager or someone, if the city has to hire someone, and you heard that earlier in the call,

932
01:17:06,110 --> 01:17:07,831
[SPEAKER_18]: there was promised a project manager.

933
01:17:07,851 --> 01:17:09,811
[SPEAKER_18]: There should be somebody designated.

934
01:17:11,312 --> 01:17:24,037
[SPEAKER_18]: I've talked to Tim many times and I somewhat understand his frustration because I think he's the only person I can call, but there should be other people handling this type of project.

935
01:17:25,458 --> 01:17:27,979
[SPEAKER_18]: We have multiple projects, not just the curbing.

936
01:17:28,139 --> 01:17:29,739
[SPEAKER_18]: We had the wind trip development.

937
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:33,801
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess the one question I have for the council and I wish

938
01:17:34,982 --> 01:17:40,205
[SPEAKER_18]: and I hope I can get an answer, would be who's in charge of enforcing this?

939
01:17:41,145 --> 01:17:50,911
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we can complain as neighbors, but we really don't have a say, whether we had the wind trip development, the curbing, the sidewalks, we really don't have a say.

940
01:17:53,212 --> 01:17:55,013
[SPEAKER_18]: We're leading the blind with the neighbors here.

941
01:17:55,033 --> 01:18:04,598
[SPEAKER_18]: Like we can complain all we want, but nobody really does anything for us besides if we complain enough, we just got this meeting.

942
01:18:05,175 --> 01:18:17,347
[SPEAKER_18]: But something like the winter of development where they put in 18 houses or whatever they're doing now, we should have been the ones making the decision for our neighbors and our neighborhood, not a developer.

943
01:18:18,127 --> 01:18:25,495
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't wanna go off on a different topic, but that's what happens a lot on this area for us.

944
01:18:26,195 --> 01:18:26,435
[SPEAKER_18]: It's-

945
01:18:29,325 --> 01:18:50,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, if I could just interrupt you real quick, Mr. says, I think that we need to, um, I think we've we've asked this before that we've called for what has worked as in person meetings, and I asked to do this at Victory Park or and at the high school parking lot with all the neighbors and ever source when we when we requested ever source to come to this meeting.

946
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:51,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that, uh,

947
01:18:52,091 --> 01:19:05,428
[SPEAKER_04]: that we make that initiative right now as an amendment to this resolution, that we call for an immediate meeting with all the neighbors and the community.

948
01:19:05,975 --> 01:19:08,717
[SPEAKER_04]: ever source team and the city administration.

949
01:19:09,097 --> 01:19:13,920
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the neighbors can look the people in the eye that have the answers for this.

950
01:19:14,300 --> 01:19:17,523
[SPEAKER_04]: We've asked to have ever source pay for clerical works.

951
01:19:17,943 --> 01:19:19,844
[SPEAKER_04]: So we make sure all the project gets done.

952
01:19:20,204 --> 01:19:22,266
[SPEAKER_04]: This is something this council has asked for as well.

953
01:19:22,286 --> 01:19:23,787
[SPEAKER_04]: So we share your frustration.

954
01:19:23,807 --> 01:19:29,130
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry to interrupt you, but I think we have to make that a point and move with that quickly.

955
01:19:29,190 --> 01:19:31,552
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you, I apologize.

956
01:19:31,792 --> 01:19:32,572
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I appreciate that.

957
01:19:35,303 --> 01:19:37,945
[SPEAKER_18]: And Dennis knows as well, because we're neighbors.

958
01:19:38,285 --> 01:19:43,648
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, one side of the street gets plowed, and we get stuck with all the snow.

959
01:19:44,268 --> 01:19:47,550
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's a lot of hard work with all the snow getting pushed on.

960
01:19:47,971 --> 01:19:58,257
[SPEAKER_18]: You look across the street, and you got city little trucks there plowing the sidewalk that nobody owns, or the city owns.

961
01:19:59,644 --> 01:20:03,747
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just, it's really disappointing.

962
01:20:03,807 --> 01:20:09,091
[SPEAKER_18]: I've spoken to mayors, I've spoken to the commissioner of DPW and promises and promises.

963
01:20:09,612 --> 01:20:22,121
[SPEAKER_18]: I like to know personally, doesn't have to be at this meeting, but I wish somebody could tell me who's in charge of enforcing these things because it's hard.

964
01:20:22,281 --> 01:20:27,185
[SPEAKER_18]: It's really hard to stay at home, pick up the phone, call the mayor's office and never get an answer.

965
01:20:27,565 --> 01:20:28,786
[SPEAKER_18]: I never get the answer I

966
01:20:29,133 --> 01:20:39,558
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not the answer I want to hear, but at least to hear somebody tell me why ever source can just drop something on, on, on my doorstep and say, we're starting construction.

967
01:20:39,978 --> 01:20:41,299
[SPEAKER_18]: And I have no clue about it.

968
01:20:41,779 --> 01:20:53,505
[SPEAKER_18]: And I had no, I had no, uh, opinion to bring to, to my neighborhood and the developer in five seconds gets a permit, throws a house down and I'm stuck here.

969
01:20:53,965 --> 01:20:54,806
[SPEAKER_18]: How did he do that?

970
01:20:54,926 --> 01:20:57,407
[SPEAKER_18]: And I had no impact on my neighbors.

971
01:20:58,198 --> 01:21:03,121
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's something that it has to happen, especially on Winthrop Street.

972
01:21:06,204 --> 01:21:10,146
[SPEAKER_18]: We get impacted so much from the 93 traffic on Winthrop Street.

973
01:21:10,226 --> 01:21:18,912
[SPEAKER_18]: Look what Winchester's doing, how many bump outs they have done from Highland to Winthrop Street.

974
01:21:19,293 --> 01:21:24,016
[SPEAKER_18]: They have done so much to help the sound, the noise, and the traffic.

975
01:21:24,616 --> 01:21:26,978
[SPEAKER_18]: Winthrop Street, we have no ADA compliance.

976
01:21:27,392 --> 01:21:28,633
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have sidewalks.

977
01:21:29,373 --> 01:21:31,474
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, literally, we're looking for a lawsuit.

978
01:21:32,274 --> 01:21:41,518
[SPEAKER_18]: And I wish somebody would step up and really give the neighbors, the community, an answer.

979
01:21:42,038 --> 01:21:43,319
[SPEAKER_18]: I called the chief of police.

980
01:21:43,719 --> 01:21:45,540
[SPEAKER_18]: I said, why didn't you shut down Winthrop Street?

981
01:21:45,720 --> 01:21:47,281
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, we're not going to shut Winthrop Street down.

982
01:21:47,461 --> 01:21:47,761
[SPEAKER_18]: Why?

983
01:21:48,241 --> 01:21:49,722
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it would impact traffic.

984
01:21:50,202 --> 01:21:51,843
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it impacts me.

985
01:21:51,923 --> 01:21:53,503
[SPEAKER_18]: Why do I have to be impacted that way?

986
01:21:54,244 --> 01:21:57,025
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's always Winthrop Street is

987
01:21:57,945 --> 01:22:02,786
[SPEAKER_18]: is, you know, look what they did on Lawrence Street, they put up they put a big bump out.

988
01:22:03,326 --> 01:22:04,867
[SPEAKER_18]: So it would slow traffic down.

989
01:22:04,927 --> 01:22:09,748
[SPEAKER_18]: Why don't we do something on Winthrop Street, traffic control to slow traffic down.

990
01:22:09,828 --> 01:22:11,288
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a lot of things we can do.

991
01:22:11,348 --> 01:22:13,709
[SPEAKER_18]: And I, I wish I could be part of that.

992
01:22:13,729 --> 01:22:19,350
[SPEAKER_18]: And, and I'm never invited or we, we at Winthrop Street, we don't care about these things.

993
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:22,531
[SPEAKER_18]: We just know when a truck shows up and we can't do anything about it.

994
01:22:23,346 --> 01:22:31,231
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think you should stop maybe, stop Eversource in their tracks and make a deal, negotiate, and then let them start work up again.

995
01:22:31,811 --> 01:22:39,155
[SPEAKER_18]: Because they're gonna continue just using Winthrop Street and I'm really tired of it personally.

996
01:22:39,255 --> 01:22:49,501
[SPEAKER_18]: And I thank you again, all you councilmen, I know how hard to hear this, because I know a lot of you live here close by to me and I really appreciate everyone's time.

997
01:22:49,561 --> 01:22:50,382
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much.

998
01:22:51,663 --> 01:22:52,443
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Mr. Lazzaro.

999
01:22:53,597 --> 01:22:55,679
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyone else have any comments?

1000
01:22:56,739 --> 01:22:57,300
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks.

1001
01:22:58,481 --> 01:23:07,828
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to address Mr. Cassano's concerns about who he can go to, as far as I'm concerned with the Eversource project, it should be the city engineer, right?

1002
01:23:07,908 --> 01:23:10,430
[SPEAKER_05]: The city engineer should be the contact person.

1003
01:23:11,210 --> 01:23:18,756
[SPEAKER_05]: If there is a clerk of the works, that person's name should be given out, but ultimately the buck stops with the city engineer to be the communicator.

1004
01:23:19,496 --> 01:23:21,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Additionally, Mr. President, when it comes to plowing,

1005
01:23:22,140 --> 01:23:36,692
[SPEAKER_05]: as Mr. Cassano mentioned, if they're plowing one way or another, it's helpful information when you get this from residents, because that's how the city should, you know, when they put together their plan of attack, when it comes time to snow plowing, how they address it.

1006
01:23:37,053 --> 01:23:42,517
[SPEAKER_05]: So this information that Mr. Cassano has given is important and it's vital that we have residents at the table.

1007
01:23:43,038 --> 01:23:45,119
[SPEAKER_05]: So he's a thousand percent correct.

1008
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:48,142
[SPEAKER_05]: When we have these type of projects going on,

1009
01:23:48,500 --> 01:23:52,908
[SPEAKER_05]: The neighborhood and the direct abutters should have the first say in what's happening.

1010
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:56,294
[SPEAKER_05]: And clearly that did not happen during this project.

1011
01:23:56,675 --> 01:23:57,577
[SPEAKER_05]: It's after the fact.

1012
01:23:57,937 --> 01:24:03,940
[SPEAKER_05]: that neighbors are given the leaflets and the door knockers and all that stuff, Mr. President, which is not helpful.

1013
01:24:04,241 --> 01:24:05,841
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to be at the table ahead of time.

1014
01:24:06,362 --> 01:24:08,203
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe we can address some of the concerns.

1015
01:24:08,563 --> 01:24:21,850
[SPEAKER_05]: But regarding the plowing, again, you probably reached out, but it would be Brian Kerins, the head of DPW, that really should be responsible for making sure that they don't plow just one side or another, and that they move snow appropriately.

1016
01:24:22,211 --> 01:24:24,752
[SPEAKER_05]: So it really should be that, Mr. President.

1017
01:24:25,242 --> 01:24:29,365
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say, ultimately, the buck stops with the mayor.

1018
01:24:29,405 --> 01:24:32,327
[SPEAKER_05]: The mayor runs the day-to-day operations of this city.

1019
01:24:32,887 --> 01:24:35,489
[SPEAKER_05]: All the department heads report directly to the mayor.

1020
01:24:35,990 --> 01:24:39,952
[SPEAKER_05]: So if there's a concern, the mayor should be addressing these concerns, Mr. President.

1021
01:24:40,393 --> 01:24:53,822
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm hoping, in a multi-million dollar project of this magnitude, when we're asking for some just minor mitigation, Mr. President, this is minor stuff to increase the length of sidewalks and curbing.

1022
01:24:54,215 --> 01:24:59,239
[SPEAKER_05]: that this would be something that the mayor meet immediately with Eversource to address.

1023
01:24:59,759 --> 01:25:15,292
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm hoping as part of the motion, Mr. President, the clerk would also send that we're requesting the mayor meet immediately to get an answer from Eversource and they can renegotiate the memorandum of understanding on behalf of the residents of that area.

1024
01:25:15,892 --> 01:25:18,834
[SPEAKER_05]: Seconding the form of amendment, Mr. Councilor Marks?

1025
01:25:19,535 --> 01:25:20,396
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, Mr. President.

1026
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:21,356
[SPEAKER_07]: I would second that.

1027
01:25:22,337 --> 01:25:23,178
[SPEAKER_22]: Seconded by Councilor Best.

1028
01:25:26,230 --> 01:25:32,033
[SPEAKER_08]: I do believe Councilor Scott Villanueva offered an amendment as well that wasn't drafted up at the on-site meeting.

1029
01:25:32,373 --> 01:25:33,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Would I be happy to second that?

1030
01:25:35,774 --> 01:25:47,520
[SPEAKER_22]: Tim, through the Chair, if I could ask you, I recall when this project first started that there were many people vying to be the project manager representing the city.

1031
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:54,863
[SPEAKER_22]: Do we have a project manager on this that represents, Tim?

1032
01:25:59,281 --> 01:26:01,322
[SPEAKER_22]: Do we have a project manager representing the city on this?

1033
01:26:02,503 --> 01:26:04,044
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have a field engineer.

1034
01:26:04,424 --> 01:26:16,292
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have someone out there on the daily on the daily confirming that they are working to Medford standards and, you know, backfilling the trench properly using the right materials, right methods, things like that.

1035
01:26:16,312 --> 01:26:22,796
[SPEAKER_12]: And we get weekly reports, but they're, they're based off the civil work or the utility work, the infrastructure.

1036
01:26:25,613 --> 01:26:29,492
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that his only scope of responsibility is just making sure they're doing the work?

1037
01:26:30,961 --> 01:26:40,448
[SPEAKER_12]: In doing it correctly, yeah, and reporting back if the issues arise or if there's issues with non-conformance and we will attack those and figure out solutions, things like that.

1038
01:26:41,649 --> 01:26:46,473
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not a typical job where the city is tracking payments, for example, where we'd have a clerk of the works.

1039
01:26:46,913 --> 01:26:58,482
[SPEAKER_12]: So the primary function of a lot of the city representation on projects is to count things and make sure that the billings are correct for the work that the contractor claims has been completed.

1040
01:26:59,062 --> 01:27:00,803
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, you know, payment requests and things like that.

1041
01:27:01,064 --> 01:27:03,605
[SPEAKER_12]: So this project is not the city's, so we're not paying for it.

1042
01:27:03,785 --> 01:27:07,628
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, uh, so they're operating under a couple of different jurisdictions.

1043
01:27:07,748 --> 01:27:11,411
[SPEAKER_12]: One of them, as Councilor Marks pointed out, is mine, the street opening permit jurisdiction.

1044
01:27:11,831 --> 01:27:19,936
[SPEAKER_12]: And then, obviously, the chief of police has a public safety jurisdiction, and the DPW commissioner has, um, the overall right-of-way jurisdiction.

1045
01:27:20,317 --> 01:27:28,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, so those are the three entities with, with jurisdiction in the right-of-way and would be providing enforcement if enforcement is required.

1046
01:27:29,458 --> 01:27:42,668
[SPEAKER_22]: Tim, if I can amend Councilor Scott-Billings, for when we have an onsite meeting, if the project engineer be at that meeting also.

1047
01:27:44,170 --> 01:27:52,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure, it's a field engineer from AI engineers who, as you recalled, they work in the competition for this particular contract.

1048
01:27:53,197 --> 01:27:56,439
[SPEAKER_22]: So I'll amend Councilor Scott-Billings.

1049
01:27:57,801 --> 01:28:03,849
[SPEAKER_22]: motion that when we have this meeting, that the field engineer be required to attend this meeting also.

1050
01:28:06,093 --> 01:28:07,675
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, do we have any further discussion on this?

1051
01:28:08,095 --> 01:28:08,616
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks.

1052
01:28:08,876 --> 01:28:14,945
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, if I can ask Tim, because as he mentioned, he is responsible for the street openings.

1053
01:28:16,275 --> 01:28:27,924
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Engineer, if the city is not happy with the progress, not happy with the quality of construction, not happy about what's going on in the community, what's our recourse as a community to stop this project?

1054
01:28:30,145 --> 01:28:32,307
[SPEAKER_12]: To stop the projects?

1055
01:28:35,088 --> 01:28:46,218
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe myself, the Commissioner of Public Works or the Chief of Police has the authority to stop the project based off of a violation in one of those jurisdictions.

1056
01:28:46,758 --> 01:28:57,228
[SPEAKER_12]: So for me, if they were doing something that was outside of the scope of their permit, then we would issue them a violation.

1057
01:28:58,718 --> 01:28:59,699
[SPEAKER_12]: and have them remedy it.

1058
01:29:00,259 --> 01:29:02,179
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's usually the course we take.

1059
01:29:02,619 --> 01:29:09,141
[SPEAKER_12]: If it's egregious or they're not responding to a warning, then, you know, not this particular project, but other projects we have shut down.

1060
01:29:09,161 --> 01:29:15,963
[SPEAKER_12]: So, you know, you can't begin work tomorrow until, you know, you have whatever the issue is resolved.

1061
01:29:17,663 --> 01:29:18,584
[SPEAKER_12]: This project, I believe,

1062
01:29:21,897 --> 01:29:34,502
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not sure if shutting it down would be the right move, necessarily, if we want them to be complete with the work, but I'm not sure if that answers your question.

1063
01:29:35,122 --> 01:29:36,742
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not asking that it be shut down.

1064
01:29:36,782 --> 01:29:48,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm asking to find out what the process is, if it's a cease and desist order, or what the actual steps are, because in my opinion, in dealing with utility companies on this council for the last 20 years,

1065
01:29:49,915 --> 01:29:53,538
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they understand is when you play hardball, in my opinion.

1066
01:29:54,138 --> 01:30:04,626
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think if the city takes a laissez-faire approach to this, and just let things proceed as usual, then they're never gonna take us serious.

1067
01:30:05,086 --> 01:30:15,494
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think at some point when we raise our concerns, and I'm hoping this comes from the administration about the sidewalk, that they take us serious, Mr. President.

1068
01:30:15,754 --> 01:30:18,716
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not gonna wanna come back to the table and renegotiate

1069
01:30:19,092 --> 01:30:20,913
[SPEAKER_05]: an MOU, but guess what?

1070
01:30:21,614 --> 01:30:26,958
[SPEAKER_05]: If we hold their feet to the fire right now, I think we'll have that leverage to do so.

1071
01:30:27,598 --> 01:30:30,060
[SPEAKER_05]: And we experienced the same thing on Riverside Ave.

1072
01:30:30,920 --> 01:30:37,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Another utility digging up, we were talking about having sidewalks that were level with the street.

1073
01:30:38,526 --> 01:30:48,633
[SPEAKER_05]: So even though there was curbing, the street was done over so many times that it was as high as the curb to the sidewalk, therefore creating an insecure pedestrian pathway.

1074
01:30:49,481 --> 01:30:54,403
[SPEAKER_05]: And we got the same feedback from the MWRA and National Grid.

1075
01:30:54,723 --> 01:30:56,843
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's not part of the scope of the project.

1076
01:30:57,364 --> 01:30:59,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we can't afford it.

1077
01:30:59,084 --> 01:30:59,884
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't do this.

1078
01:31:00,185 --> 01:31:01,665
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't do that, Mr. President.

1079
01:31:02,005 --> 01:31:03,866
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to hold their feet to the fire.

1080
01:31:04,406 --> 01:31:09,348
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it's a cease and desist order and having them stop, it's going to hit them in the pocket.

1081
01:31:09,708 --> 01:31:10,848
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they understand.

1082
01:31:11,408 --> 01:31:12,809
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe that's what we need to do.

1083
01:31:12,829 --> 01:31:17,890
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't worry me about a potential lawsuit or whatever else it might be.

1084
01:31:18,131 --> 01:31:19,291
[SPEAKER_05]: The residents come first.

1085
01:31:20,069 --> 01:31:28,192
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think we're at a point with this project that we need to reshape the work in this project and make sure we're leading and not falling behind this.

1086
01:31:28,632 --> 01:31:30,992
[SPEAKER_05]: So I appreciate council Scott Belly bringing that up.

1087
01:31:31,272 --> 01:31:33,393
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope the mayor's on the phone tomorrow morning.

1088
01:31:33,973 --> 01:31:38,055
[SPEAKER_05]: We see a lot of press releases, but I hope we get a press release that matters.

1089
01:31:38,355 --> 01:31:43,756
[SPEAKER_05]: A press release that comes out and says we're doing something positive that impacts residents, Mr. President.

1090
01:31:43,976 --> 01:31:45,297
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope we see something positive.

1091
01:31:45,597 --> 01:31:45,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1092
01:31:46,217 --> 01:31:46,997
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Locks.

1093
01:31:49,752 --> 01:31:51,653
[SPEAKER_22]: You have your hand up, Mr. Clark, can you please?

1094
01:31:56,717 --> 01:31:57,198
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening, sir.

1095
01:31:57,218 --> 01:31:58,539
[SPEAKER_22]: Can I name an address on the record, please?

1096
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:01,881
[SPEAKER_15]: Joanna Quintero Mejia, 35 Early Ave.

1097
01:32:02,342 --> 01:32:06,865
[SPEAKER_15]: And actually, Council Marks just said everything I was going to say to the residents, especially.

1098
01:32:07,286 --> 01:32:08,246
[SPEAKER_15]: They do have recourse.

1099
01:32:08,947 --> 01:32:11,289
[SPEAKER_15]: They can play high ball, get themselves a lawyer.

1100
01:32:11,649 --> 01:32:12,990
[SPEAKER_15]: They have a right to live peacefully.

1101
01:32:13,370 --> 01:32:16,873
[SPEAKER_15]: And there should be a projected end date on the project.

1102
01:32:17,233 --> 01:32:17,614
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

1103
01:32:18,975 --> 01:32:19,235
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1104
01:32:20,406 --> 01:32:21,306
[SPEAKER_22]: Any further questions?

1105
01:32:22,827 --> 01:32:23,487
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. President.

1106
01:32:25,228 --> 01:32:25,608
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening.

1107
01:32:25,808 --> 01:32:26,628
[SPEAKER_22]: Address the director, please.

1108
01:32:27,688 --> 01:32:29,489
[SPEAKER_06]: Orlando 13 Winfrey Way.

1109
01:32:29,649 --> 01:32:31,930
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't come down here to speak about this, but as I listen.

1110
01:32:33,070 --> 01:32:34,431
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate everything that's being said.

1111
01:32:34,491 --> 01:32:42,393
[SPEAKER_06]: We know the safety issues, the quality of life issues and so on, but we're really now we're we're in behind the curve.

1112
01:32:43,313 --> 01:32:45,674
[SPEAKER_06]: At the beginning, the horses out of the bond.

1113
01:32:45,774 --> 01:32:47,875
[SPEAKER_06]: Were there any performance metrics put on?

1114
01:32:48,278 --> 01:32:58,981
[SPEAKER_06]: with this contract before it started, was in terms of completion dates, lack of completion dates, fines on a weekly basis, the quality of life issue.

1115
01:33:00,121 --> 01:33:03,622
[SPEAKER_06]: Beyond the repaving of the streets, that should be a given.

1116
01:33:04,323 --> 01:33:15,586
[SPEAKER_06]: But why isn't the city imposing on such contractors, you are affecting quality of life in our city for three, four, five years, and in some cases, 10, I'm hearing,

1117
01:33:16,983 --> 01:33:28,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Why isn't a condition in place that you, that contractor, that developer, that utility, will pay the city X amount of dollars in addition to the road corrections?

1118
01:33:28,828 --> 01:33:36,150
[SPEAKER_06]: $2 million to deal with the lack of performance, to deal with the loss of quality of life.

1119
01:33:36,790 --> 01:33:39,671
[SPEAKER_06]: Those things should be negotiated on any contract.

1120
01:33:39,791 --> 01:33:43,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been involved with programs, both private and public, and

1121
01:33:44,596 --> 01:33:50,938
[SPEAKER_06]: Dealing with what we're dealing with now after the fact, you have little to no leverage.

1122
01:33:51,838 --> 01:33:55,159
[SPEAKER_06]: What I just heard the Councilor Mark say, what can we do?

1123
01:33:55,179 --> 01:33:56,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Cease and desist.

1124
01:33:57,799 --> 01:34:00,040
[SPEAKER_06]: These are difficult things to do after the fact.

1125
01:34:00,940 --> 01:34:01,260
[SPEAKER_06]: Why?

1126
01:34:01,280 --> 01:34:04,941
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess the lesson is learn from this.

1127
01:34:05,461 --> 01:34:12,403
[SPEAKER_06]: The next big contractor comes in the city, sit down and play hardball before the first shovel goes in the ground.

1128
01:34:13,403 --> 01:34:13,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

1129
01:34:14,371 --> 01:34:14,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, sir.

1130
01:34:17,512 --> 01:34:18,012
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyone else?

1131
01:34:19,493 --> 01:34:33,959
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so on the motion by Councilor Marks, as amended by Councilor Marks twice, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli, as amended by Councilor Caraviello-Viello.

1132
01:34:35,580 --> 01:34:37,901
[SPEAKER_22]: I'd like to offer an amendment as well.

1133
01:34:38,081 --> 01:34:38,821
[SPEAKER_08]: As amended by,

1134
01:34:41,728 --> 01:34:42,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Knight.

1135
01:34:42,569 --> 01:34:50,915
[SPEAKER_08]: As I go through my paperwork here, Mr. President, you know, I have a document dated April 30th, 2015, the Mystic to Woburn transmission project.

1136
01:34:51,776 --> 01:34:58,841
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a document here, the Mystic to Woburn 115 kilovolt line project, Medford City Council presentation dated May 19th, 2015.

1137
01:34:58,962 --> 01:35:03,505
[SPEAKER_08]: I have the same document dated October 20th, 2015.

1138
01:35:05,427 --> 01:35:06,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Another presentation, November 14th, 2017,

1139
01:35:09,264 --> 01:35:11,846
[SPEAKER_08]: And another presentation is the present February 4th, 2020.

1140
01:35:12,566 --> 01:35:16,169
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's time we bring them back for another presentation as to what's going on.

1141
01:35:16,849 --> 01:35:19,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get everybody in the same room here as well as onsite.

1142
01:35:20,652 --> 01:35:24,515
[SPEAKER_08]: So that everybody that has something to say can participate and can express their concerns with the president.

1143
01:35:24,575 --> 01:35:29,678
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to offer that as a formal motion that just as they have previously, I was supposed to pay before the council.

1144
01:35:29,698 --> 01:35:31,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Last time they were here was February 4th, 2020.

1145
01:35:31,520 --> 01:35:36,844
[SPEAKER_22]: So councilor Nays in the form of motion was expected to get councilor Nays.

1146
01:35:37,424 --> 01:35:38,925
[SPEAKER_22]: We have a second on councilor Nays motion.

1147
01:35:41,613 --> 01:35:43,614
[SPEAKER_22]: Second by Councilor Falco.

1148
01:35:43,974 --> 01:35:49,496
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so on the main paper, offered by Councilor Marks as amended.

1149
01:35:51,936 --> 01:35:53,177
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1150
01:35:54,057 --> 01:35:55,717
[SPEAKER_22]: Offered by Councilor Marks, second and by.

1151
01:35:56,138 --> 01:35:56,438
[SPEAKER_22]: Second.

1152
01:35:56,978 --> 01:35:57,598
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

1153
01:35:58,018 --> 01:35:58,978
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Marks.

1154
01:35:59,019 --> 01:36:01,659
[SPEAKER_05]: Just if we could, I just want to follow up.

1155
01:36:02,059 --> 01:36:03,580
[SPEAKER_05]: Rick Orlando hit the nail on the head.

1156
01:36:04,405 --> 01:36:05,546
[SPEAKER_05]: because he's absolutely right.

1157
01:36:05,686 --> 01:36:12,372
[SPEAKER_05]: After the fact, it's increasingly difficult to try to get any type of mitigation or any agreements.

1158
01:36:13,053 --> 01:36:15,675
[SPEAKER_05]: And we should have some form of metrics.

1159
01:36:15,975 --> 01:36:17,316
[SPEAKER_05]: He's 1000% right.

1160
01:36:17,757 --> 01:36:19,979
[SPEAKER_05]: And he was part of the building of the new schools.

1161
01:36:20,039 --> 01:36:22,741
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that's where a lot of the metrics came from.

1162
01:36:23,282 --> 01:36:26,925
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, Mr. President, when you sit down and negotiate,

1163
01:36:27,621 --> 01:36:40,706
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're looking at a project of this magnitude and the impact of the community and look at a few items of sidewalks and a winter circle being done over and the mitigation was next to nothing on this project.

1164
01:36:41,107 --> 01:36:42,067
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's absolutely right.

1165
01:36:42,455 --> 01:36:54,400
[SPEAKER_05]: You should have a contingency and say, we're going to put $2 million in a fund that if we're not happy with the outcome of this project, we can take money to do additional sidewalks, signage, marking streets, whatever it might be.

1166
01:36:55,021 --> 01:37:02,004
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't even know what damage is being caused to personal property, a neighbor's wall, the cracks in their ceilings and so forth.

1167
01:37:02,404 --> 01:37:06,326
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know there's other insurance binders for that, but he's a thousand percent right.

1168
01:37:06,346 --> 01:37:09,427
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope moving forward, Mr. President, the city engineers on the call

1169
01:37:09,863 --> 01:37:14,689
[SPEAKER_05]: that we do have some type of listing when it comes to metrics and a check off.

1170
01:37:14,989 --> 01:37:17,372
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have to recreate the wheel, a check off.

1171
01:37:17,632 --> 01:37:18,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we do this?

1172
01:37:18,213 --> 01:37:18,793
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we do that?

1173
01:37:18,833 --> 01:37:19,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we do this?

1174
01:37:19,855 --> 01:37:24,760
[SPEAKER_05]: And that way, at least we know when we're working through a project that we did our homework.

1175
01:37:25,061 --> 01:37:27,483
[SPEAKER_05]: Because right now, when I look at the memorandum of understanding,

1176
01:37:28,184 --> 01:37:28,884
[SPEAKER_05]: It says nothing.

1177
01:37:28,924 --> 01:37:29,905
[SPEAKER_05]: It's two paragraphs.

1178
01:37:30,405 --> 01:37:31,345
[SPEAKER_05]: It really says nothing.

1179
01:37:32,086 --> 01:37:39,449
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, whoever negotiated that, don't ever have to negotiate on my behalf because the city got nothing, Mr. President, on this project.

1180
01:37:39,709 --> 01:37:43,731
[SPEAKER_05]: And the residents, which comprise of this community, got nothing in return.

1181
01:37:44,211 --> 01:37:45,031
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1182
01:37:45,072 --> 01:37:46,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1183
01:37:46,392 --> 01:37:47,032
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President.

1184
01:37:47,212 --> 01:37:47,813
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President.

1185
01:37:49,654 --> 01:37:50,954
[SPEAKER_07]: I just had a quick question.

1186
01:37:50,974 --> 01:37:53,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Martz, what's the date on that MOU?

1187
01:37:53,215 --> 01:37:57,557
[SPEAKER_22]: Give me one second.

1188
01:37:58,120 --> 01:37:58,500
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1189
01:38:01,043 --> 01:37:58,500
14, 15.

1190
01:38:11,371 --> 01:38:14,934
[SPEAKER_05]: So the date I have for this, this was a response back.

1191
01:38:15,275 --> 01:38:16,075
[SPEAKER_05]: This date is March 9, 2017.

1192
01:38:16,456 --> 01:38:17,357
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, thank you.

1193
01:38:17,477 --> 01:38:18,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1194
01:38:18,518 --> 01:38:19,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1195
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:21,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1196
01:38:22,181 --> 01:38:24,783
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, I'm Bob Pento, Zero Summit Road, Method Mass.

1197
01:38:25,126 --> 01:38:26,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Rick just jogged my mind.

1198
01:38:26,887 --> 01:38:34,449
[SPEAKER_02]: The city has in its Department of Public Works, anytime a street is opened by a public utility, there is a bond that they have to place.

1199
01:38:34,489 --> 01:38:36,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it's gone from five to $10,000.

1200
01:38:37,630 --> 01:38:45,073
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what really needs to be checked, if you wanna get into this review as Rick suggested, and he's absolutely right, have those bonds been taken out?

1201
01:38:45,393 --> 01:38:50,075
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the city sitting on any kind of money in its legal department or the Department of Public Works?

1202
01:38:50,535 --> 01:38:53,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Because one of the big complaints before when the streets were being dug up by utilities,

1203
01:38:54,260 --> 01:38:57,781
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't being put back in the way they were or made better than what they were.

1204
01:38:58,122 --> 01:39:02,343
[SPEAKER_02]: And many streets are like that in the city, national grids coming in, they've done that on numerous occasions.

1205
01:39:02,844 --> 01:39:06,385
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a result of that, I think it's something that you probably should look into.

1206
01:39:06,405 --> 01:39:10,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Have they filed anything by way of a bond with the city as it relates to this?

1207
01:39:11,267 --> 01:39:18,150
[SPEAKER_02]: And more importantly, when you talk about the residents not getting their fair share out of this whole thing, Councilor Marx is right.

1208
01:39:18,550 --> 01:39:26,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if in that agreement, in that purchase and whatever you want to call it, that agreement between the city and Eversource, it keeps going on.

1209
01:39:26,716 --> 01:39:39,984
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we know, and I'll ask Councilor Knight, Vice President Knight, if you look at all those additions that they've had since 2015, I guarantee you that the personnel that started this aren't the same personnel that's there right now.

1210
01:39:40,305 --> 01:39:42,886
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that's the case, that's where the city is losing out.

1211
01:39:43,186 --> 01:39:46,949
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why you need it hard and fast right up front when the contract is signed,

1212
01:39:47,714 --> 01:39:48,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Once again, what are they putting up?

1213
01:39:49,034 --> 01:39:50,975
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they putting up a million or two million?

1214
01:39:51,035 --> 01:39:53,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever the contingency might be, but you have it right now.

1215
01:39:54,076 --> 01:39:56,357
[SPEAKER_02]: You have it already built into the Department of Public Works.

1216
01:39:56,737 --> 01:40:00,578
[SPEAKER_02]: When the public utility comes into the city, they have to place a bond.

1217
01:40:00,898 --> 01:40:05,879
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they don't place the bond, they don't get their money back as it relates to the work that they've done.

1218
01:40:06,239 --> 01:40:08,480
[SPEAKER_02]: And there has to be what they call a performance bond.

1219
01:40:08,857 --> 01:40:10,479
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the term, performance bond.

1220
01:40:10,519 --> 01:40:17,145
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that's not in the contract and they are digging up the street and Eversource is in fact utility, then shame on the city.

1221
01:40:17,245 --> 01:40:24,191
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you do have it, then maybe that $10,000 ought to be increased to a million or two because of the magnitude and the scope of the project.

1222
01:40:24,812 --> 01:40:26,693
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Rick Orlando, you jog my memory.

1223
01:40:27,474 --> 01:40:27,734
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1224
01:40:29,503 --> 01:40:42,308
[SPEAKER_08]: I also think it's important to take a look and see if we're contributing the decisions of the administration and contributing to delays by not allowing more crews out on the roadways and not taking some steps to address it dynamically.

1225
01:40:42,348 --> 01:40:44,549
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, obviously we know that this project's been a disaster.

1226
01:40:44,589 --> 01:40:46,350
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been going on for about a part of five years.

1227
01:40:46,890 --> 01:40:50,732
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, the MOU says what it says, but it might be time to go back to the table and really

1228
01:40:51,142 --> 01:40:56,664
[SPEAKER_08]: look at what's going on and try to figure out if this traffic management plan is the best and what we can do to get additional crews out there.

1229
01:40:57,104 --> 01:41:05,526
[SPEAKER_08]: I always find it interesting when a resolution makes its way into the agenda and then someone from the administration comes and says, actually on Monday, we have three crews out there working now.

1230
01:41:05,546 --> 01:41:06,867
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's gonna be the first day it happens.

1231
01:41:06,927 --> 01:41:08,147
[SPEAKER_08]: It seems kind of reactionary.

1232
01:41:08,647 --> 01:41:10,628
[SPEAKER_08]: And I don't blame the city engineer for this.

1233
01:41:10,668 --> 01:41:16,110
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that he has a lot going on and that he only has limited control over certain aspects of this project.

1234
01:41:16,550 --> 01:41:20,791
[SPEAKER_08]: But with that being said, Mr. President, is city decision-making contributing

1235
01:41:22,188 --> 01:41:25,089
[SPEAKER_08]: a lack of city decision making contributing to the ongoing delays as well.

1236
01:41:25,109 --> 01:41:26,410
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that's important to consider.

1237
01:41:29,151 --> 01:41:30,052
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1238
01:41:30,612 --> 01:41:37,215
[SPEAKER_22]: So on the original motion offered by Council Locke says, I think, who seconded?

1239
01:41:37,956 --> 01:41:38,576
[SPEAKER_22]: I missed the second.

1240
01:41:40,357 --> 01:41:43,238
[SPEAKER_22]: I think Councilor Scarpelli seconded.

1259
01:42:08,967 --> 01:42:10,968
[SPEAKER_22]: On Councilor Knight's, Vice President Knight's made a motion.

1260
01:42:11,308 --> 01:42:14,609
[SPEAKER_22]: I thought it was, I thought it was, I thought it was an amendment.

1261
01:42:14,649 --> 01:42:14,850
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1262
01:42:14,950 --> 01:42:16,850
[SPEAKER_22]: I thought you wanted it to be a motion.

1263
01:42:18,291 --> 01:42:19,432
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

1264
01:42:19,612 --> 01:42:20,292
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, so we'll keep it.

1265
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:24,533
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, thank you, everybody.

1266
01:42:24,553 --> 01:42:26,436
[SPEAKER_22]: All right, 2-1-3-8-4 offered by Vice President Knight.

1267
01:42:26,936 --> 01:42:31,383
[SPEAKER_22]: We're asked to pursue the Governor Baker's lifting of the COVID-19 restrictions.

1268
01:42:32,052 --> 01:42:34,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Before you go through this, I will be withdrawing this paper this evening.

1269
01:42:35,113 --> 01:42:38,894
[SPEAKER_08]: The governor has extended the special pocket outdoor dining regulations.

1270
01:42:39,975 --> 01:42:47,597
[SPEAKER_08]: Massachusetts Restaurant Association had worked with the governor's office to extend certain provisions of the emergency order that were lifted.

1271
01:42:47,637 --> 01:42:48,358
[SPEAKER_08]: This is one of them.

1272
01:42:48,878 --> 01:42:54,360
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, the purpose and intent of this resolution has been addressed and there's no need for further discussion.

1273
01:42:55,300 --> 01:42:58,861
[SPEAKER_22]: So on the- Withdrawn.

1274
01:42:59,121 --> 01:43:00,702
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Knight has withdrawn his motion.

1275
01:43:03,200 --> 01:43:06,282
[SPEAKER_22]: 2-1-385 offered by Councilor Marks.

1276
01:43:07,503 --> 01:43:20,532
[SPEAKER_22]: Whereas in response to a recent resolution regarding requests by this council that the administration ask Waste Management to clean residents' barrels, the administration answered that Waste Management is unable to provide this service to residents.

1277
01:43:20,632 --> 01:43:27,817
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, therefore, be it resolved that the administration identify and procure a vendor to provide the service on the resident's behalf.

1278
01:43:28,177 --> 01:43:28,838
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks.

1279
01:43:30,227 --> 01:43:31,187
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1280
01:43:31,207 --> 01:43:39,810
[SPEAKER_05]: I offered this resolution several weeks back on behalf of the residents of this community that would like to see their recycle in their trash barrel.

1281
01:43:40,170 --> 01:43:41,591
[SPEAKER_05]: How to wash Mr. President.

1282
01:43:42,491 --> 01:43:46,493
[SPEAKER_05]: We then asked waste management if they provide the service.

1283
01:43:46,893 --> 01:43:53,755
[SPEAKER_05]: The city came back last week and stated they do not provide waste management does not provide that type of service.

1284
01:43:54,175 --> 01:43:58,977
[SPEAKER_05]: So last week I was unable because it wasn't on the agenda to ask that the city administration

1285
01:43:59,817 --> 01:44:10,920
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, hire a private contractor to come in during trash pickup and alert residents that barrels will be washed right after the trash is picked up, Mr. President.

1286
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:21,043
[SPEAKER_05]: Power washed in the interest of public safety, in the interest of rodent concerns, Mr. President, when you have lingering food and other smells coming from a barrel.

1287
01:44:21,703 --> 01:44:27,525
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would ask that the city administration immediately hire a private contractor

1288
01:44:27,969 --> 01:44:31,210
[SPEAKER_05]: to provide that service on behalf of the residents of this community.

1289
01:44:31,810 --> 01:44:32,690
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Councilor Marks.

1290
01:44:33,830 --> 01:44:37,811
[SPEAKER_22]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Scott Belli.

1291
01:44:38,812 --> 01:44:39,912
[SPEAKER_22]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1292
01:44:40,972 --> 01:44:41,532
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Bears.

1293
01:44:41,732 --> 01:44:41,992
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1294
01:44:42,212 --> 01:44:42,853
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Falco.

1295
01:44:42,893 --> 01:44:43,113
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

1296
01:44:43,273 --> 01:44:43,993
[SPEAKER_22]: Vice President Knight.

1297
01:44:48,054 --> 01:44:48,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Vice President Knight.

1298
01:44:48,894 --> 01:44:50,114
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thinking, Mr. President.

1299
01:44:51,755 --> 01:44:52,015
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1300
01:44:54,175 --> 01:44:54,795
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Marks.

1301
01:44:55,456 --> 01:44:55,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1302
01:44:56,376 --> 01:44:56,956
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Morell.

1303
01:44:57,666 --> 01:44:59,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli, President Caraviello.

1304
01:44:59,707 --> 01:45:01,349
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, I'm in the frame of the motion pass.

1305
01:45:03,130 --> 01:45:17,580
[SPEAKER_22]: Offered by Councilor Bez and Councilor Morelle, be it resolved that the City Council, that the City Administration address the issue of senior center parking as part of any implementation of parking policy and enforcement changes.

1306
01:45:17,620 --> 01:45:18,201
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Bez.

1307
01:45:18,441 --> 01:45:19,321
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1308
01:45:19,341 --> 01:45:22,944
[SPEAKER_07]: I think as everyone behind this rail and across the city knows,

1309
01:45:23,722 --> 01:45:27,384
[SPEAKER_07]: The senior center has very limited parking immediately adjacent to it.

1310
01:45:27,985 --> 01:45:45,755
[SPEAKER_07]: And prior to the implementation of Park Medford seniors would use the city parking lot across the street without incident, whether they're going to on a trip or leaving their car there or going just to the senior center to do the activities and spend time at the senior center.

1311
01:45:46,978 --> 01:45:50,161
[SPEAKER_07]: Once Park Medford came in, that lot became restricted.

1312
01:45:50,201 --> 01:45:51,302
[SPEAKER_07]: A kiosk went in.

1313
01:45:52,723 --> 01:45:56,246
[SPEAKER_07]: Initially, there were no additional parking spots for the senior center at all.

1314
01:45:56,706 --> 01:46:06,634
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe the mitigation that was made was that there are certain, I think 20 or so permits that the senior center has that allows seniors to park in that lot for about three hours.

1315
01:46:07,594 --> 01:46:11,277
[SPEAKER_07]: But that hasn't been enough, quite frankly, for the senior center.

1316
01:46:11,878 --> 01:46:15,841
[SPEAKER_07]: If residents are going on a day trip, you know, eight, 10 hours,

1317
01:46:17,749 --> 01:46:20,731
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, the three hour limit there is insufficient.

1318
01:46:21,332 --> 01:46:26,395
[SPEAKER_07]: They've tried to find some other alternatives, but people are constantly worried that they'll be ticketed or towed.

1319
01:46:27,136 --> 01:46:43,028
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of the things that did not make it into the enforcement report, as far as I could tell, was what would happen with senior center parking as these policies and enforcement and policies are changed.

1320
01:46:43,762 --> 01:46:59,588
[SPEAKER_07]: So the request here is that the administration as it implements any parking changes, make sure that the senior center has sufficient parking for a sufficient amount of time for seniors to adequately use the center for all of the various activities that they use.

1321
01:47:00,488 --> 01:47:02,309
[SPEAKER_07]: There are several suggestions that could work.

1322
01:47:02,569 --> 01:47:06,230
[SPEAKER_07]: One of them, I believe I've heard many of my fellow Councilors mentioned before,

1323
01:47:06,790 --> 01:47:17,740
[SPEAKER_07]: is that there should be a senior parking permit citywide, that seniors should be exempt or have a special permit that exempts them from the kiosks and those various charges.

1324
01:47:18,272 --> 01:47:24,735
[SPEAKER_07]: Another option would be to change the rules specifically on that lot to expand the amount of time that seniors can park there.

1325
01:47:24,755 --> 01:47:34,520
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there's a lot of ways that this could be addressed, but it's a serious issue for seniors, for the staff at the senior center, and for folks who use that space.

1326
01:47:34,600 --> 01:47:42,343
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just hope, and that's why I filed this along with Councilor Morell, that the city administration will make sure that this is finally worked out.

1327
01:47:43,844 --> 01:47:52,351
[SPEAKER_07]: All of our residents can access the senior center, park there and do the various activities and services that they use the senior center for.

1328
01:47:52,711 --> 01:47:53,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1329
01:47:53,832 --> 01:47:54,772
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you, Councilor Bears.

1330
01:47:55,433 --> 01:48:05,801
[SPEAKER_22]: The record, President Caraviello has a senior citizen parking pass that I know many senior citizens in the community have, so that allows them to park there.

1331
01:48:06,381 --> 01:48:12,125
[SPEAKER_22]: I got tired of paying the $25 tickets and as soon as I turned 65, I got my pass right away.

1332
01:48:14,112 --> 01:48:14,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1333
01:48:14,873 --> 01:48:17,614
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to thank Councilor Beres for introducing this with me.

1334
01:48:17,634 --> 01:48:32,682
[SPEAKER_11]: He hit on really all the key points, but I want to add that the timing of this is, you know, in addition to being time for, you know, the hopeful implementation or looking at parking policy and enforcement changes for the report is just the anticipation of pandemic restrictions ending.

1335
01:48:32,742 --> 01:48:40,246
[SPEAKER_11]: And this is a cohort of residents that have, you know, really been harmed by the inability to kind of gather and have that community that the senior center provides.

1336
01:48:40,286 --> 01:48:42,207
[SPEAKER_11]: So it would just be, you know,

1337
01:48:43,544 --> 01:48:51,068
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really needed timing to have this hammered out and figured out by the time our seniors are returning and able to meet in person once more.

1338
01:48:51,768 --> 01:48:52,108
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1339
01:48:53,669 --> 01:48:54,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Councilor Morell.

1340
01:48:54,570 --> 01:48:57,811
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, if I may, is there a time limit on your permit?

1341
01:48:57,831 --> 01:48:59,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you can only say- One year.

1342
01:48:59,232 --> 01:49:01,393
[SPEAKER_07]: Just in terms of how long you can stay in a specific spot?

1343
01:49:03,214 --> 01:49:06,876
[SPEAKER_21]: It's whenever, I don't know, I've never, I haven't gotten a ticket since I've gone.

1344
01:49:06,896 --> 01:49:09,217
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, thank you.

1345
01:49:11,944 --> 01:49:13,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1346
01:49:13,064 --> 01:49:14,325
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd answer the councilor's question.

1347
01:49:14,585 --> 01:49:16,966
[SPEAKER_08]: For all two hour parking spots, you're allowed three hours.

1348
01:49:16,986 --> 01:49:22,448
[SPEAKER_08]: You get an extra hour every whatever the spot says in terms of if it's a one hour spot, you get two hours.

1349
01:49:22,508 --> 01:49:25,429
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's two hours, you get three hours according to the police department website.

1350
01:49:26,149 --> 01:49:31,992
[SPEAKER_08]: But I wonder, Mr. President, if there's a way that we could implement the mechanism where an individual, if they get a parking, if they get a ticket,

1351
01:49:32,509 --> 01:49:34,190
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an automatic mechanism.

1352
01:49:34,230 --> 01:49:40,154
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's someone that's over the age of 65, upon payment of the ticket, they're also given an application to apply for the senior citizen parking pass.

1353
01:49:40,934 --> 01:49:57,985
[SPEAKER_08]: So, say an individual that's over the age of 65, like yourself, got a parking ticket, oh, say down out in front of a place, maybe, I don't know if it's been there, Magnificent Muffins, you know, and you got a ticket out in front of Magnificent Muffin, when you paid the ticket, then they'd have an automatic mechanism to say, Richard Caraviello paid this ticket, he's a Metro resident, we know what his registration says.

1354
01:49:59,085 --> 01:50:01,467
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we send him an application in the mail?

1355
01:50:02,103 --> 01:50:07,725
[SPEAKER_08]: that says you're eligible for the 65 plus parking program is the application.

1356
01:50:07,825 --> 01:50:10,706
[SPEAKER_08]: They have no problem sending out late notices when people don't pay Mr. President.

1357
01:50:11,046 --> 01:50:21,009
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that, you know, in an effort to address some of the issues like Councilor Scarpelli brought up with the amnesty day and stuff like that, this might be a way for us to get in front of some of these issues that are arising.

1358
01:50:21,525 --> 01:50:22,486
[SPEAKER_08]: with Park Metro number one.

1359
01:50:22,506 --> 01:50:25,609
[SPEAKER_08]: Number two, it seems to me like Park Metro is out the door.

1360
01:50:26,209 --> 01:50:39,461
[SPEAKER_08]: We did get a correspondence from the administration relatively recently indicating that their contract was up relatively soon and the administration is having meetings of some sort to discuss the future of parking in the city.

1361
01:50:39,481 --> 01:50:45,086
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand that we did have a committee put together to do some examination.

1362
01:50:45,606 --> 01:50:47,328
[SPEAKER_08]: I felt the presentation was a little bit focused

1363
01:50:47,845 --> 01:50:51,529
[SPEAKER_08]: more so on the Greenland extension sites and a little bit less on citywide efforts and endeavors.

1364
01:50:51,989 --> 01:51:05,563
[SPEAKER_08]: But with that being said, Mr. President, I certainly think that an automatic mechanism that notifies seniors that they're available and that they're eligible for this type of service, this type of amenity that the city can provide would be very helpful to the residents in the community.

1365
01:51:05,924 --> 01:51:10,068
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'd like to offer that in the form of a motion as to whether or not Park Metro can determine

1366
01:51:10,704 --> 01:51:18,987
[SPEAKER_08]: if there is a way that they can offer, extend applications to residents in the community that are 65 years or older, when they pay a ticket that they received.

1367
01:51:20,787 --> 01:51:21,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1368
01:51:21,627 --> 01:51:32,811
[SPEAKER_22]: I know the senior center does have passes that they do give out to, because we do have a lot of residents, a lot of people that go there that don't live in Medford, and they do give them passes to put on their car, they bring them back.

1369
01:51:32,851 --> 01:51:37,092
[SPEAKER_22]: So I don't know how many they have, but I know that is a service officer, Officer Bass.

1370
01:51:37,677 --> 01:51:40,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and along those lines, I appreciate the additional information.

1371
01:51:40,879 --> 01:51:44,901
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the issue is, it's a two hour spot, so you can stay for three hours.

1372
01:51:45,281 --> 01:51:51,185
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only, I think, 20, I believe 22 is the number, I might be wrong, but there's more passes out than there are spots.

1373
01:51:51,245 --> 01:52:01,870
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of one of those situations where if additional spots could be signed for this, and if they could be signed to be, you know, you can park there all day, that would address a lot of the issues that I've been hearing.

1374
01:52:02,051 --> 01:52:03,531
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's the intent here.

1375
01:52:04,632 --> 01:52:04,852
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1376
01:52:04,872 --> 01:52:06,333
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, Council Member Max.

1377
01:52:07,067 --> 01:52:07,607
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1378
01:52:07,627 --> 01:52:09,468
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank my colleagues for putting this on.

1379
01:52:09,528 --> 01:52:15,391
[SPEAKER_05]: And let me tell you, over the years, the seniors have received a lot of lip service.

1380
01:52:16,432 --> 01:52:26,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Just recently, Mr. President, in the last mayoral debate in this community, it was stated by one of the candidates that seniors would get free parking.

1381
01:52:27,937 --> 01:52:29,238
[SPEAKER_05]: Free parking, Mr. President.

1382
01:52:29,998 --> 01:52:32,640
[SPEAKER_05]: And that can be accomplished very simple.

1383
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:35,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyone that has a car registered,

1384
01:52:36,362 --> 01:52:40,963
[SPEAKER_05]: that's of senior age, Mr. President, would get a senior sticker.

1385
01:52:42,264 --> 01:52:45,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now you have to pay $25 for the sticker.

1386
01:52:46,525 --> 01:52:48,646
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't sound free to me, Mr. President.

1387
01:52:49,286 --> 01:52:51,066
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's been a lot of promises made.

1388
01:52:51,987 --> 01:52:58,889
[SPEAKER_05]: And when the time comes, a lot of things promised, but then never followed through.

1389
01:52:59,969 --> 01:53:03,230
[SPEAKER_05]: I would ask, Mr. President, where is the senior free parking?

1390
01:53:03,770 --> 01:53:06,131
[SPEAKER_05]: What happened to the senior free parking program?

1391
01:53:07,533 --> 01:53:10,455
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a valid question to ask, Mr. President.

1392
01:53:12,676 --> 01:53:13,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1393
01:53:14,697 --> 01:53:16,058
[SPEAKER_22]: Is that a form of amendment?

1394
01:53:17,058 --> 01:53:17,779
[SPEAKER_22]: Absolutely.

1395
01:53:18,039 --> 01:53:18,419
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1396
01:53:18,439 --> 01:53:23,202
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, so as amended by Councilor Marks.

1397
01:53:25,763 --> 01:53:26,484
[SPEAKER_22]: Any further discussion?

1398
01:53:26,944 --> 01:53:35,509
[SPEAKER_22]: So on the motion by Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Morell, as amended by Councilor Marks.

1399
01:53:37,447 --> 01:53:38,047
[SPEAKER_22]: And by Vice President Knight.

[SPEAKER_05]: And by Vice President Knight.

01:54:02,697 --> 01:54:03,337
[SPEAKER_05]: And by Vice President Knight.

01:54:03,397 --> 01:54:03,997
[SPEAKER_05]: And by Vice President Knight.

01:54:04,317 --> 01:54:05,017
[SPEAKER_05]: And by Vice President Knight.

1434
01:54:05,037 --> 01:54:05,718
[SPEAKER_05]: And by Vice President Knight.

1435
01:54:05,738 --> 01:54:06,298
[SPEAKER_05]: And by Vice President Knight.

1436
01:54:06,318 --> 01:54:06,438
[SPEAKER_05]: And by

1437
01:54:06,718 --> 01:54:10,483
[SPEAKER_05]: us all, including the community, an update, Mr. President.

1438
01:54:10,843 --> 01:54:13,326
[SPEAKER_05]: So I would ask that we receive an update.

1439
01:54:13,626 --> 01:54:17,370
[SPEAKER_05]: I would also ask that we receive an update when the senior center is going to open.

1440
01:54:17,410 --> 01:54:23,257
[SPEAKER_05]: As you heard from my colleagues, the seniors rely on talking to other seniors, getting their information,

1441
01:54:23,877 --> 01:54:25,358
[SPEAKER_05]: socializing, Mr. President.

1442
01:54:25,738 --> 01:54:29,559
[SPEAKER_05]: And there have been 14, 15 months without being able to socialize.

1443
01:54:29,839 --> 01:54:33,280
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's about time we get our seniors back in the senior center.

1444
01:54:33,540 --> 01:54:44,364
[SPEAKER_05]: And for those seniors that can't get out there, let's offer them the service that's provided by Mystic Elders service to allow the seniors that aren't in mobile to get them there as well, Mr. President.

1445
01:54:44,424 --> 01:54:44,684
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1446
01:54:46,961 --> 01:54:56,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Mr. President, on Council Max's point, I think it's also important to point out that the administration had recently asked the council to fund a position called the COVID-19 communication specialist.

1447
01:54:58,045 --> 01:54:59,545
[SPEAKER_08]: So I don't see any reason why if Ms.

1448
01:54:59,605 --> 01:55:06,808
[SPEAKER_08]: O'Connor is not available, that this other city employee that works in the press office can't appear before the council and provide us with the update.

1449
01:55:07,228 --> 01:55:08,348
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Council Max, for bringing it up.

1450
01:55:09,649 --> 01:55:10,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1451
01:55:10,389 --> 01:55:13,190
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Mr. President, just to follow up, I don't want to beat a dead horse,

1452
01:55:13,671 --> 01:55:15,092
[SPEAKER_05]: But you hear all the different dates.

1453
01:55:15,772 --> 01:55:17,674
[SPEAKER_05]: May 29th, you can take your mask off.

1454
01:55:17,994 --> 01:55:23,017
[SPEAKER_05]: June 15th is the date that the governor said that you can stop meeting without having a mask on.

1455
01:55:23,338 --> 01:55:25,239
[SPEAKER_05]: Then are you allowed to go in stores?

1456
01:55:25,319 --> 01:55:29,282
[SPEAKER_05]: Are individual private owners of stores allowed to keep you out if you don't have your mask?

1457
01:55:29,522 --> 01:55:34,605
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of questions, Mr. President, that this is the time we should be hearing from the city.

1458
01:55:35,126 --> 01:55:36,246
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're nowhere to be found.

1459
01:55:36,266 --> 01:55:41,430
[SPEAKER_22]: I would think that would be the job of the new hire.

1460
01:55:42,773 --> 01:55:47,856
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know whose job it is, Mr. President, but you know, someone has to do it.

1461
01:55:50,177 --> 01:55:53,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Mock.

1462
01:55:53,559 --> 01:55:56,080
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Mock's actually struck upon an important point.

1463
01:55:56,320 --> 01:56:10,508
[SPEAKER_10]: If she's not gonna be here to give us an update and no one's gonna be sent from the department to give us an update, we should get some sort of a written update as to what's going on, if there are any changes that are happening, what are the vital metrics that we should know.

1464
01:56:12,534 --> 01:56:13,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Because we're being asked all the time.

1465
01:56:15,036 --> 01:56:19,539
[SPEAKER_10]: And we should be informed by the administration if Marianne can't come to a meeting.

1466
01:56:20,720 --> 01:56:27,025
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you could please communicate that to her and her department that if they can't send someone, at least send us some sort of a written update.

1467
01:56:27,825 --> 01:56:29,026
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. Clerk, can you put that into the record?

1468
01:56:29,106 --> 01:56:35,808
[SPEAKER_08]: On that point, Mr. President, because I do believe this council voted and we said, you know, we'd appreciate you coming to give us an update, but we also want it in writing.

1469
01:56:35,988 --> 01:56:40,530
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason we want it in writing is so we can keep a record of what's going on so we can have a snapshot in time.

1470
01:56:41,190 --> 01:56:49,014
[SPEAKER_08]: So we don't have to go back and watch a meeting from two years ago about the other source construction pipeline per se, when we have paperwork that they gave us on it.

1471
01:56:49,034 --> 01:56:51,295
[SPEAKER_08]: So I concur with councilor Falco 100%.

1472
01:56:51,815 --> 01:56:56,257
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we have a very well-funded communications office and we should be getting communications.

1473
01:56:56,917 --> 01:56:57,197
[SPEAKER_22]: Correct.

1474
01:56:58,574 --> 01:56:58,874
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1475
01:56:58,954 --> 01:56:59,734
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1476
01:57:00,075 --> 01:57:02,937
[SPEAKER_22]: If you read, we got this put on our desk tonight.

1477
01:57:03,317 --> 01:57:04,658
[SPEAKER_22]: It says programs will start in June.

1478
01:57:04,678 --> 01:57:09,661
[SPEAKER_22]: We are not physically open to the public yet, but we are beginning some activities by appointment only.

1479
01:57:10,382 --> 01:57:19,748
[SPEAKER_22]: So again, I think I asked for a plan three weeks ago on opening the senior center up and I never received a response on that.

1480
01:57:20,929 --> 01:57:25,292
[SPEAKER_22]: So again, this is the lifeline for the seniors in this community.

1481
01:57:25,973 --> 01:57:29,896
[SPEAKER_22]: And I tell you, I don't want to anytime I'm out shopping or anywhere.

1482
01:57:30,336 --> 01:57:34,539
[SPEAKER_22]: First question I see a senior is, when is the senior center going to open?

1483
01:57:34,799 --> 01:57:35,600
[SPEAKER_22]: When are we getting back?

1484
01:57:36,200 --> 01:57:41,124
[SPEAKER_22]: And like Councilor Marksley, we're hearing rules from everybody and we don't know whose rule is what anymore.

1485
01:57:44,314 --> 01:57:44,774
[SPEAKER_22]: Councilor Marks.

1486
01:57:45,074 --> 01:57:49,677
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the Memorial Day ceremony that's gonna take place at the Oak Grove Cemetery.

1487
01:57:49,717 --> 01:57:49,957
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1488
01:57:50,257 --> 01:57:52,518
[SPEAKER_05]: That's been a tradition for a hundred years in this community.

1489
01:57:52,578 --> 01:57:52,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1490
01:57:53,099 --> 01:57:56,100
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're gonna actually, last year we were unable to meet due to COVID.

1491
01:57:56,420 --> 01:57:58,421
[SPEAKER_05]: We just got a response that we're gonna have an in-person.

1492
01:57:58,582 --> 01:57:58,782
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1493
01:57:58,842 --> 01:58:02,484
[SPEAKER_05]: And as part of the letter it stated, this is gonna be on May 31st, correct?

1494
01:58:02,644 --> 01:58:02,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Correct.

1495
01:58:02,944 --> 01:58:05,445
[SPEAKER_05]: As part of the letter it stated that you have to wear a mask.

1496
01:58:05,885 --> 01:58:08,507
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the inconsistencies.

1497
01:58:08,707 --> 01:58:10,648
[SPEAKER_22]: I thought I heard that because it was outside,

1498
01:58:11,162 --> 01:58:13,203
[SPEAKER_22]: masks weren't going to be required.

1499
01:58:13,223 --> 01:58:18,187
[SPEAKER_05]: The letter I read said you have to wear a mask at this event from the city administration.

1500
01:58:18,747 --> 01:58:20,048
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I read in the letter.

1501
01:58:20,428 --> 01:58:22,230
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's fine if that's what they want to do.

1502
01:58:22,470 --> 01:58:30,015
[SPEAKER_05]: But these are the inconsistencies that I think we need some type of direction on, Mr. President, not just for our benefit, for the residents of this community.

1503
01:58:30,575 --> 01:58:31,056
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I agree.

1504
01:58:31,896 --> 01:58:37,100
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I just want to add that I definitely agree with my colleagues that

1505
01:58:37,770 --> 01:58:44,416
[SPEAKER_07]: We should be getting the weekly written updates that we requested especially if the Board of Health staff can't be in attendance at the meeting.

1506
01:58:46,518 --> 01:58:51,482
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just add that the, the order that's being released on March on May 29.

1507
01:58:52,937 --> 01:58:57,141
[SPEAKER_07]: It says if you are fully vaccinated, there are situations where you no longer have to wear a mask.

1508
01:58:57,161 --> 01:58:59,184
[SPEAKER_07]: There are other situations where it's still recommended.

1509
01:58:59,644 --> 01:59:06,371
[SPEAKER_07]: And I also believe that the city health department and board of health can still implement other regulations.

1510
01:59:06,411 --> 01:59:12,197
[SPEAKER_07]: So I completely agree with all my colleagues that we need that information because right now we don't have it.

1511
01:59:12,237 --> 01:59:15,120
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're saying, what is the rule here in Medford?

1512
01:59:16,114 --> 01:59:17,375
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just wanted to put that out there.

1513
01:59:17,716 --> 01:59:21,180
[SPEAKER_07]: And there is information on the mass.gov website around the governor's order.

1514
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:24,083
[SPEAKER_07]: If folks who are watching want to learn more.

1515
01:59:24,423 --> 01:59:24,764
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1516
01:59:25,424 --> 01:59:25,785
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

1517
01:59:25,905 --> 01:59:31,792
[SPEAKER_05]: So Mr. President, if I could, all along in this community, we've been following the governor's order.

1518
01:59:32,392 --> 01:59:33,594
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've been following the CDC.

1519
01:59:35,148 --> 01:59:39,770
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've been heard that our border health is bound by the governor's order and the CDC.

1520
01:59:40,070 --> 01:59:43,292
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the governor is saying that you can go outside without a mask.

1521
01:59:43,552 --> 01:59:45,093
[SPEAKER_05]: The CDC is saying the same thing.

1522
01:59:45,373 --> 01:59:50,875
[SPEAKER_05]: But the city has yet to come out and say why we have to wear a mask or why we don't have to wear a mask.

1523
01:59:51,215 --> 01:59:52,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they no longer following?

1524
01:59:52,776 --> 01:59:55,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Now they're coming up with their own rules and regulations.

1525
01:59:55,858 --> 01:59:58,059
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the questions that we need answered, Mr. President.

1526
01:59:58,319 --> 02:00:01,040
[SPEAKER_05]: The school committee is coming back June 7th.

1527
02:00:02,323 --> 02:00:06,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard last night at their meeting, they're gonna come back in person on June 7th.

1528
02:00:07,746 --> 02:00:21,655
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was one particular member of the school committee that spent more time figuring out how you're gonna throw residents out of the meeting that aren't wearing a mask than deciding what the rules and regulations are and social distancing and so forth.

1529
02:00:22,075 --> 02:00:25,437
[SPEAKER_05]: But they're more concerned about throwing people out of meetings, Mr. President.

1530
02:00:25,877 --> 02:00:30,760
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know what direction we're going in, but we need direction from this city administration.

1531
02:00:32,997 --> 02:00:33,957
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1532
02:00:34,117 --> 02:00:55,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I think it's also very important when we look at, you know, not only the seniors in that community, not only the administration of government, but you know, what families rely on in the summertime, um, you know, the recreation department, participation limits surrounding summer fun camp, rights, pawn tops pool, um, the recreational programs that are offered to the rec department.

1533
02:00:55,446 --> 02:00:56,667
[SPEAKER_08]: They're all right now limited.

1534
02:00:57,421 --> 02:00:59,462
[SPEAKER_08]: because of the participation limits, Mr. President.

1535
02:00:59,482 --> 02:01:04,824
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you wanted to sign your kid up for the Saturday morning basketball league, it's $145 for five weeks.

1536
02:01:04,844 --> 02:01:08,785
[SPEAKER_08]: You get 45 minutes a week, and it's limited to six kids.

1537
02:01:09,186 --> 02:01:10,886
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a community of 60,000 people.

1538
02:01:11,226 --> 02:01:16,388
[SPEAKER_08]: If you wanted to have your kid play in the recreation department's basketball program, it's limited to six kids.

1539
02:01:17,029 --> 02:01:18,489
[SPEAKER_08]: It's less than 1% of the population.

1540
02:01:18,529 --> 02:01:19,329
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information?

1541
02:01:20,090 --> 02:01:21,350
[SPEAKER_08]: Point of information, Councilor Scapino.

1542
02:01:21,390 --> 02:01:25,932
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe to enlighten you, the recreation housing now lifted

1543
02:01:26,553 --> 02:01:36,655
[SPEAKER_04]: all the limitations, any participants outdoors for recreation programming, the instructors and the kids do not need to wear a mask.

1544
02:01:37,255 --> 02:01:49,977
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're indoor recreational activities, they still have to wear a mask and still keep the social distancing, but they've lifted almost everything dealing with recreation.

1545
02:01:50,017 --> 02:01:53,698
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope, and Mr. Bailey's usually on this,

1546
02:01:54,449 --> 02:01:57,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully you can set increase in those council vice-president.

1547
02:01:57,331 --> 02:02:03,317
[SPEAKER_08]: So when you say there's important, when you say their Councilor, you're referring to the governor, the governor, not the city administration.

1548
02:02:03,477 --> 02:02:03,757
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.

1549
02:02:03,817 --> 02:02:03,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1550
02:02:04,017 --> 02:02:10,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Because when I recently checked the recreation website, the participation limits was still at six, six people per event.

1551
02:02:10,983 --> 02:02:11,864
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we need these.

1552
02:02:12,204 --> 02:02:15,787
[SPEAKER_09]: We need some clarification department heads as well.

1553
02:02:15,807 --> 02:02:16,488
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for that.

1554
02:02:16,968 --> 02:02:17,168
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1555
02:02:17,188 --> 02:02:21,832
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that, uh,

1556
02:02:23,022 --> 02:02:28,605
[SPEAKER_10]: the main point is clarification because it seems like there are definitely some inconsistencies from what we're hearing yet.

1557
02:02:29,205 --> 02:02:46,713
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we could please actually form I guess a motion amendment that we have Marion specifically state towards in writing, if there are any inconsistencies that the city is, if the city has different rules than what are being implied by the state.

1558
02:02:48,654 --> 02:02:50,015
[SPEAKER_22]: No, I do not.

1559
02:02:50,155 --> 02:02:51,896
[SPEAKER_22]: Constable if you repeat that for the court please.

1560
02:02:52,806 --> 02:03:05,074
[SPEAKER_10]: I would like to know, I'd like to know if the city is, if the city's rules regarding COVID are different from what the state guidelines are.

1561
02:03:05,415 --> 02:03:08,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Are the city guidelines different from the state guidelines with regard to COVID?

1562
02:03:17,503 --> 02:03:17,763
[SPEAKER_22]: Thank you.

1563
02:03:19,704 --> 02:03:20,985

1610

1618
02:05:40,632 --> 02:05:44,355

1619
02:05:46,036 --> 02:05:48,097
[SPEAKER_22]: Do we already vote on that?

1620
02:05:48,697 --> 02:05:49,337
[SPEAKER_22]: We didn't vote on that.

1621
02:05:50,797 --> 02:05:52,958

[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1628
02:06:00,801 --> 02:06:01,501

1630
02:06:01,921 --> 02:06:02,401

[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1632
02:06:02,901 --> 02:06:03,481
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Morell?

02:06:03,581 --> 02:06:03,801
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1634
02:06:03,981 --> 02:06:04,582
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1635
02:06:04,602 --> 02:06:04,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1636
02:06:05,082 --> 02:06:05,862
[SPEAKER_09]: President Caraviello?

1637
02:06:06,202 --> 02:06:07,783
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I'm in the front of the motion passes.

1638
02:06:08,243 --> 02:06:09,443
[SPEAKER_22]: Public participation.

1639
02:06:10,483 --> 02:06:13,324
[SPEAKER_22]: Would anyone like to speak in public participation?

1640
02:06:17,307 --> 02:06:17,728
[SPEAKER_22]: Good evening.

1641
02:06:17,768 --> 02:06:18,989
[SPEAKER_22]: Name and address of the record, please.

1642
02:06:19,289 --> 02:06:21,771
[SPEAKER_16]: Rosalie DeLucia, 30 Walcott Street.

1643
02:06:23,612 --> 02:06:32,238
[SPEAKER_16]: I almost left, but I came because after watching last week's meeting, I'm totally overwhelmed as to what is happening with this city.

1644
02:06:32,899 --> 02:06:41,405
[SPEAKER_16]: Why in heaven's name are we exhausting our money and time on changing the name of the Columbus School?

1645
02:06:41,845 --> 02:06:42,886
[SPEAKER_16]: It makes no sense.

1646
02:06:43,386 --> 02:06:46,208
[SPEAKER_16]: And as Rick Orlando says, if it ain't broke, don't fix it.

1647
02:06:46,709 --> 02:06:53,155
[SPEAKER_16]: Why are we going to put our money into this when we should be putting it into the education of our children?

1648
02:06:54,376 --> 02:06:58,940
[SPEAKER_16]: I mean, changing the name to me is like you're trying to change history.

1649
02:06:59,600 --> 02:07:04,084
[SPEAKER_16]: And I have spoken to many of my neighbors in the community, inside and out.

1650
02:07:05,105 --> 02:07:06,987
[SPEAKER_16]: My daughter went to the Columbus School.

1651
02:07:07,928 --> 02:07:08,929
[SPEAKER_16]: There's nothing wrong.

1652
02:07:09,789 --> 02:07:12,572
[SPEAKER_16]: Put the money into educating the children.

1653
02:07:12,954 --> 02:07:14,876
[SPEAKER_16]: Forget changing the name.

1654
02:07:14,936 --> 02:07:15,816
[SPEAKER_16]: It makes no sense.

1655
02:07:15,856 --> 02:07:18,158
[SPEAKER_16]: You're causing a war in the city.

1656
02:07:19,659 --> 02:07:20,280
[SPEAKER_16]: It's awful.

1657
02:07:21,121 --> 02:07:21,661
[SPEAKER_16]: It's awful.

1658
02:07:22,121 --> 02:07:24,623
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't know who started this or for what purpose.

1659
02:07:25,284 --> 02:07:28,146
[SPEAKER_16]: I know when I went to school, there was nothing wrong with Christopher Columbus.

1660
02:07:28,166 --> 02:07:29,247
[SPEAKER_16]: He discovered America.

1661
02:07:29,327 --> 02:07:30,028
[SPEAKER_16]: He was a good man.

1662
02:07:30,048 --> 02:07:30,608
[SPEAKER_16]: He's a hero.

1663
02:07:30,648 --> 02:07:31,929
[SPEAKER_16]: We celebrate Columbus Day.

1664
02:07:32,270 --> 02:07:33,891
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, all of a sudden, he's a bad man.

1665
02:07:34,531 --> 02:07:36,533
[SPEAKER_16]: Listen, that was back in the 1400s.

1666
