1
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:10,693
Hey listeners, this is Danielle.

2
00:00:11,073 --> 00:00:11,574
And Shelley.

3
00:00:12,314 --> 00:00:14,956
Shelley is a radical Dravidian and racial equity activist.

4
00:00:15,256 --> 00:00:17,998
And Danielle is a community mobilizer and changemaker.

5
00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:20,340
And this is the Medford Bites podcast.

6
00:00:21,621 --> 00:00:28,506
Every two weeks, we chew on the issues facing Medford and deliver bites of information about the city by lifting the expertise of our guests.

7
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:32,409
Join us in discussion about what you hope for the future of Medford.

8
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:34,911
And as always, tell us where you like to eat.

9
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:38,990
All right, thanks so much for being with us today.

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,112
If you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name, pronouns, and who you are.

11
00:00:44,232 --> 00:00:44,452
Sure.

12
00:00:44,552 --> 00:00:48,834
Brianna Lungo Kern, Mayor of Medford, and my pronouns are she and her.

13
00:00:48,854 --> 00:00:50,095
Great.

14
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:51,456
Well, thanks for being back with us.

15
00:00:52,036 --> 00:00:53,116
You've been on a few times.

16
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,117
We really appreciate it.

17
00:00:55,297 --> 00:00:58,599
And you have answered this question in the past, but we'll see if there's any updates to your answer.

18
00:00:59,379 --> 00:01:01,961
Favorite place to eat in Medford, and what do you like to eat there?

19
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:04,742
Jeez, I love

20
00:01:05,383 --> 00:01:06,972
a good meal from Fiore, Italy.

21
00:01:07,595 --> 00:01:08,781
That's one of my favorites.

22
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:11,020
Nice.

23
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,962
Yeah, I'm a big fan of like grilled octopus.

24
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:17,465
They do like a really good, like really good.

25
00:01:17,585 --> 00:01:17,805
Great.

26
00:01:17,865 --> 00:01:18,345
So thank you.

27
00:01:18,365 --> 00:01:28,852
So we wanted to hear your thoughts, maybe some explanation and some of your thoughts as the mayor on the three questions that we're going to be voting on in November.

28
00:01:28,932 --> 00:01:32,334
So that have to do with overrides and debt exclusions.

29
00:01:32,755 --> 00:01:35,457
So maybe we could start with those, the second two questions.

30
00:01:35,537 --> 00:01:40,520
So seven and eight that propose different types of overrides to the city budget.

31
00:01:41,563 --> 00:01:44,145
Sure, yeah, thank you for having me, both of you.

32
00:01:44,165 --> 00:01:49,929
I think I've been pretty quiet because we've had a busy summer, but it's time.

33
00:01:49,969 --> 00:01:56,654
We're only weeks away from the November election where the city has three important questions on the ballot.

34
00:01:56,874 --> 00:02:05,761
And yes, that's a good idea to start with seven and eight, which are the financial questions as it relates to two different overrides.

35
00:02:06,602 --> 00:02:08,943
And an override is different than a debt exclusion.

36
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:10,725
An override will be in perpetuity

37
00:02:11,563 --> 00:02:29,618
And I think they're very important, and I encourage everybody to really understand what they are before they make their decision, because they will only benefit for the good our students and our faculty at the schools, as well as city staff on the DPW end.

38
00:02:29,738 --> 00:02:32,320
So with question seven, it's 3.5 million.

39
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,981
500,000 of that is for the city to hire a crew

40
00:02:41,615 --> 00:02:46,739
that will be responsible just for streets and sidewalks.

41
00:02:48,440 --> 00:03:03,192
Our DPW department works extremely hard, but as you notice, the number one complaint you see either on social media or that I get on email is potholes and deterioration of our streets and sidewalks.

42
00:03:03,252 --> 00:03:08,617
So when I came into office in 2021, we did a street and sidewalk assessment which showed

43
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:14,665
well over $200 million needed to repair all the streets and sidewalks that need to be repaired.

44
00:03:15,284 --> 00:03:16,744
And we are trying our best to keep up.

45
00:03:16,784 --> 00:03:28,546
We are trying our best to get ahead of where we were, but due to the decades of neglect, we could really, really use another crew out there to fill in potholes.

46
00:03:29,067 --> 00:03:36,248
We have equipment that will do patchwork, which means like if there's a section of a street that's really bad, they can go out and square it off.

47
00:03:36,308 --> 00:03:40,129
And you see that happening some, but we obviously need more of it.

48
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:41,349
You see us out,

49
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:47,512
fixing sidewalks, but we do have, we can do that in-house and we would like to do more of it.

50
00:03:48,193 --> 00:03:57,178
I'm not saying that that crew might not get pulled for an emergency if there's a water main break and we need them, but we want a crew of about three, maybe

51
00:03:57,962 --> 00:04:06,508
about three people, maybe four, to focus mainly and entirely on our streets and sidewalks, which desperately need it.

52
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:12,853
And that's something that we've been hearing from all sides in this city about, and I think it's extremely important.

53
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:13,994
And I know that we have

54
00:04:14,643 --> 00:04:21,145
know, one of the strongest engineering and DPW teams we've ever had, especially with regards to the leadership.

55
00:04:21,165 --> 00:04:30,368
You know, Owen Wartell, who's our engineer, and Tim McGivern, who's our DPW director, as well as Todd Blake, who's our traffic and traffic transportation director.

56
00:04:30,928 --> 00:04:32,109
They know what's needed.

57
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:34,709
They're working very, very hard to get it done.

58
00:04:34,729 --> 00:04:36,370
It doesn't help that we have

59
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:58,100
climate change issues so during our winters are warmer and we are freezing at night and then defrosting during the day and any crack that is in our street is filling with water it's expanding it's melting and back and forth like during the winter especially we're not getting caught up to like may or may or so now with potholes and it's it's

60
00:04:58,539 --> 00:05:01,882
It's a lot to handle, so we could really use another crew.

61
00:05:02,322 --> 00:05:08,828
So I really hope the taxpayers see that piece of the question as important for the city.

62
00:05:09,508 --> 00:05:11,310
The second piece is the $3 million.

63
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:22,739
And what I think is most important to understand is that $3 million is not to hire more staff necessarily or do anything extravagant.

64
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:24,661
$2 million of that $3 million is

65
00:05:26,022 --> 00:05:31,104
the current staff we have working in our school district today.

66
00:05:32,184 --> 00:05:42,008
What we did in the last budget, knowing we were prepping for the override questions, is the school department obviously had to make a whole lot of cuts.

67
00:05:42,768 --> 00:05:50,711
And after they made millions in cuts, we had another two, two and a half million that still needed to be cut.

68
00:05:51,491 --> 00:05:53,092
So the financial task force and I,

69
00:05:54,747 --> 00:06:00,873
which has been, we've been extremely transparent, as you know, there's about three, at least three press releases on the work we've done.

70
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,614
We work together and we

71
00:06:04,921 --> 00:06:09,123
upfronted or gave an advance to get through the fiscal year 25 budget.

72
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:12,285
And so we didn't have to lay off even more people.

73
00:06:13,765 --> 00:06:19,028
So that was almost $2 million in current staff that this question covers.

74
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,590
That's one of the largest pieces of the $3 million.

75
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,552
And they are staff from teachers, paras,

76
00:06:27,145 --> 00:06:36,869
secretaries, behavioral supports, mental health supports, guidance counselors, nurses, their staff that we, our children, our school district needs.

77
00:06:37,089 --> 00:06:42,511
And we, I mean, we really, really need this question to pass and I really hope it does.

78
00:06:43,732 --> 00:06:47,393
And other two pieces of that that are important are our tech.

79
00:06:47,653 --> 00:06:53,396
Technology is expensive and our students deserve new technology every three to five, six, seven years.

80
00:06:54,036 --> 00:06:55,116
And that means 500,000 a year.

81
00:06:57,353 --> 00:07:03,957
We used one-time funding to purchase that, but that is something that should be in the budget and is needed year after year after year.

82
00:07:04,537 --> 00:07:06,778
So IT is a big piece of that question.

83
00:07:07,179 --> 00:07:17,664
And one that is extremely important to me, and it's something that I'm working, even though managing the city, I am, we are, my city staff and myself are helping the school district with maintenance.

84
00:07:19,045 --> 00:07:25,849
Not only preventative maintenance, but maintenance of our security equipment, maintenance of our door locks, safety, you know,

85
00:07:26,961 --> 00:07:29,903
maintenance that has to do with safety of our students as well.

86
00:07:30,963 --> 00:07:32,704
And there alone is the $3 million.

87
00:07:32,724 --> 00:07:36,567
Now, we also have transportation needs.

88
00:07:36,647 --> 00:07:42,170
We have this two mile walking distance that we'd like to be able to close that gap.

89
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,992
So this money could go an extremely long way.

90
00:07:45,472 --> 00:07:55,938
And I would never have supported this if I didn't think we, if I thought we weren't doing a good job on the city and school side to get rid of and hold

91
00:07:56,398 --> 00:07:58,339
you know, our department's accountable with their spending.

92
00:07:58,747 --> 00:08:12,129
It's taken four and a half years, and right now, I'm very in tuned and working to make sure we're not wasting on overtime and making sure we don't have personnel that there's not enough work for.

93
00:08:12,569 --> 00:08:14,230
We've right-sized it.

94
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:20,311
You have a good school committee, good leadership in the schools, and we've done the hard work, as you saw.

95
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:25,692
We made a plethora of cuts, unfortunately, but some of those cuts

96
00:08:27,652 --> 00:08:33,753
I think show you that we know where the money's needed and where we need to put additional funding.

97
00:08:34,333 --> 00:08:52,677
So that 3.5 million is one of the most important things that we're gonna experience in November, because to have to cut current more personnel will be devastating for the fiscal year 26 budget, and mostly devastating for our children.

98
00:08:54,077 --> 00:09:04,683
Yeah, no, I think that like a lot of what I've been hearing is this question about like how we analyze what we're doing with what we have and how can we kind of make more out of less.

99
00:09:04,723 --> 00:09:10,627
And it sounds like that's something that you've been doing for many years and it's sort of run out of options.

100
00:09:11,447 --> 00:09:20,913
And we did have somebody write into us that was sort of, he was sort of looking at the current, you know, the budget over the last few years for the school department and noticing that

101
00:09:21,573 --> 00:09:26,274
there had been increases of about $7 million marked for things like busing and paras.

102
00:09:27,174 --> 00:09:41,238
And so his question was like, how do we know we can use additional funds to solve this problem if we haven't been able to do it with the past budget increases?

103
00:09:41,258 --> 00:09:47,600
And I think you've answered that, but if you want to address it at all anymore, I think we could hear that.

104
00:09:48,524 --> 00:09:57,794
I think people know that the school committee, the city council, and myself have really prioritized our schools and our school district and funding in our school system.

105
00:09:58,595 --> 00:10:10,468
And each year, including one year where I think schools got a 9% plus increase, every year on the city side, I'm really tasking our department heads to

106
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:22,471
produce a budget that is within our means because of the high costs that are associated with, that are going up everywhere, but especially in our school system.

107
00:10:23,052 --> 00:10:25,074
And that we're at a breaking point.

108
00:10:26,261 --> 00:10:33,827
where I can't ask city departments to cut any more because we need to give 10% more to the schools or 12% or 13%.

109
00:10:34,327 --> 00:10:50,999
And that goes along with what you said, it's costs are rising in special ed, they're rising in transportation, they're rising in utilities faster than our 2% that we're able to tax residential and commercial is allowing us to fund.

110
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:53,061
So I think

111
00:10:53,583 --> 00:11:00,247
The 3.5 million will go a very long way, just helping us stabilize, not face any more cuts.

112
00:11:01,168 --> 00:11:13,515
And then also on the maintenance side, get facilities maintenance contracts in place for hopefully January 1, when hopefully the money comes in, to make sure our schools aren't deteriorating any more than they are.

113
00:11:14,035 --> 00:11:21,500
Alone, it cost us a million and a half dollars to hire an OPM to review the HVAC systems in our schools.

114
00:11:22,128 --> 00:11:29,214
And it's upwards of 15 plus million just to do the fixes we need on the air conditioning at the Andrews and the McGlynn alone.

115
00:11:30,035 --> 00:11:33,317
So people say, why don't you use free cash to fund the budget?

116
00:11:33,357 --> 00:11:37,141
Why don't you use free cash for the cuts?

117
00:11:37,481 --> 00:11:41,905
We did this year, and we had, because of the lost revenues in COVID,

118
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,341
but that's not sustainable.

119
00:11:44,701 --> 00:11:50,525
The cuts are gonna come sooner than later if we continue to plug the budget with any one-time funding.

120
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:51,966
We cannot continue to do that.

121
00:11:52,367 --> 00:12:06,676
We have so many needs for that one-time funding from fire trucks to lighting that's going down, just requests in the last few weeks, lighting that needs to be replaced on Freedom Way.

122
00:12:08,438 --> 00:12:11,781
overage for construction costs to keep our streets safe.

123
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:16,765
There's a project on Spring and Central that needed another $250,000 to get done.

124
00:12:17,186 --> 00:12:24,653
We need to provide some funding for some fixes that are needed at the Brooks Estate and the cemetery buildings.

125
00:12:25,293 --> 00:12:27,155
The list is never ending.

126
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:33,281
And even though we built up our free cash supply more than we ever have, I think

127
00:12:34,322 --> 00:12:41,526
And that has to do, I think, with some of the ARPA funding and the way revenue loss fell back into free cash.

128
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:48,169
We're never going to be able to sustain a budget and budget increases with free cash.

129
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:49,590
We just won't.

130
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:51,751
We put some money into stabilization accounts.

131
00:12:52,251 --> 00:12:57,413
There's a couple million dollars sitting for fire trucks that are being built now.

132
00:12:57,634 --> 00:13:00,095
There is $3 million from that free cash that is

133
00:13:00,908 --> 00:13:10,291
being put aside for an OPM and the design and architecture work for hopefully the work we'll do with the new high school and the list goes on.

134
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:18,393
There's just not enough money to sustain personnel and recurring costs with what we have now, which is one time funding.

135
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:32,371
And it also seemed like the way it's been described to me, it seems like that, like if it's not like financially wise to use free cash like that, either it's, it sounds as like, it's kind of like planning your household budget based on your savings account.

136
00:13:32,471 --> 00:13:38,234
Um, and I like, I like the analogy with, you know, my sister, my daughter just got her, her permit.

137
00:13:38,795 --> 00:13:42,357
If she came to me and said, Hey mom, I just made $500 from my birthday.

138
00:13:42,377 --> 00:13:42,857
Can I lease a car?

139
00:13:46,743 --> 00:13:55,410
That's the best analogy I've heard and that I tell people, because I would say to her, absolutely not.

140
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:58,112
You have one payment for your car lease.

141
00:13:58,253 --> 00:13:59,734
What are you going to do for the rest?

142
00:13:59,794 --> 00:14:02,796
You'll be able to drive it for a month, and then they will take it back.

143
00:14:03,979 --> 00:14:07,081
And yeah, and that's just, it's not, it's against best practice.

144
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:08,983
It would make our bond rating go down.

145
00:14:09,323 --> 00:14:13,346
We need a good bond rating because we want to build a new fire headquarters.

146
00:14:14,306 --> 00:14:18,969
We want to build a new high school and the list, you know, again, the list goes on.

147
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:20,791
Thank you.

148
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:25,054
Do you want to talk at all about question eight?

149
00:14:26,027 --> 00:14:26,348
Sure, sure.

150
00:14:26,368 --> 00:14:28,973
I'll be brief about question eight at full transparency.

151
00:14:29,013 --> 00:14:36,008
My sister is a teacher at the McGlynn, so I am somewhat staying out of this question, but I think it's important for

152
00:14:38,196 --> 00:14:51,160
people to know that this question, it's $4 million to be able to work on some of the problems, which is, we all know the high school scheduling is a problem that needs to be changed.

153
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,262
Time in the classroom is something that a bunch of us have been talking about for a long time.

154
00:14:57,902 --> 00:15:05,204
And this question would allow us the ability to even have a seat at the table and negotiate changes with

155
00:15:06,024 --> 00:15:10,308
scheduling and class time that's going to cost funding that's going to have to be negotiated.

156
00:15:10,968 --> 00:15:25,460
We fully understand that but it's something we want to do and we believe it's benefit our students, especially at the vocational school in the high school where you have students, both students who may want to take Spanish or art

157
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:35,724
And either they don't have the ability to do it because their schedule doesn't allow, because you need that extra 15 plus minutes in the day, or they're taking classes on Zoom after hours.

158
00:15:35,784 --> 00:15:41,266
You know, there's so much that needs to be fixed, and we really want to provide our students with this opportunity.

159
00:15:42,046 --> 00:15:51,830
So I think it was good that we split these two questions, because it's one is, you know, basically current needs that need to continue and maybe be enhanced some, and then the four million is,

160
00:15:52,688 --> 00:15:53,950
We are building a new high school.

161
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,592
We care about our students.

162
00:15:55,632 --> 00:15:56,934
We care about our faculty.

163
00:15:57,274 --> 00:16:03,923
We want to have the ability to sit at the table and negotiate and make sure that these schedules work for the Vogue and the high school.

164
00:16:04,303 --> 00:16:10,031
And we want to make sure that our elementary and middle school students, too, have more opportunities.

165
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:12,010
Thank you.

166
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:12,850
Yeah, yeah.

167
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:23,453
So, we did kind of reach out to folks in the city to see if they had like questions or feedback in support or against these, these three questions.

168
00:16:24,053 --> 00:16:32,775
We pretty much only got messages of support and we did have one person, express a question related to question six which is the dead.

169
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:55,940
um and they were one they had heard which we've heard as well and watched some of the videos about um that some of the firefighters and folks in the firefighter union are against this debt exclusion against the money to build a new fire headquarters so i don't know if you want to share any of your thoughts on that or kind of what your experience has been there um thank you yeah i mean

170
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:05,483
From the beginning, when I got elected, we put a committee together, a task force to go over all the needs of all of our stations, including headquarters.

171
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:13,152
And out of that meeting, which was, I think their report was done by early 2021, but I stand to be corrected.

172
00:17:17,187 --> 00:17:28,224
We had millions of dollars in needs amongst our six fire stations and we've done a ton of work to from windows to roofs to kitchens and beyond.

173
00:17:29,483 --> 00:17:31,063
It's been a group effort.

174
00:17:31,304 --> 00:17:35,745
My chief of staff Nina Nazarian has taken the lead on those projects.

175
00:17:36,505 --> 00:17:41,506
And the fire headquarters was also something that came out of it that obviously we need a new fire headquarters.

176
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:46,208
I think I was on the council when we were building a new when the plans came out for the new police station.

177
00:17:46,228 --> 00:17:47,288
And I said, please, please.

178
00:17:47,722 --> 00:17:50,344
take a time out and do a combined station.

179
00:17:50,544 --> 00:17:57,968
It will cost us less in the long run, and our fire department deserves a new headquarters.

180
00:17:58,028 --> 00:18:00,470
It's the same building as the deteriorating police station.

181
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,611
That didn't happen, and here we are.

182
00:18:02,991 --> 00:18:10,036
We've spent two years plus with, we have an architect, we have an OPM, and we are well on our way.

183
00:18:10,116 --> 00:18:12,777
We've invested over a million dollars in that work.

184
00:18:13,738 --> 00:18:17,962
that is pretty much getting finalized at this point.

185
00:18:18,642 --> 00:18:23,286
And I believe that our fire department deserves a new headquarters.

186
00:18:23,466 --> 00:18:25,508
And this is the way to do it.

187
00:18:25,928 --> 00:18:30,612
We decided, the task force and I decided a debt exclusion is the way to do it.

188
00:18:30,672 --> 00:18:35,456
Because if you put it on the budget, if you put the bond payments and principal and interest on the budget,

189
00:18:36,035 --> 00:18:41,340
it would be more that you're taking away from what I say would be the schools, more you're having to balance.

190
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:44,363
This debt exclusion is a question.

191
00:18:44,443 --> 00:18:45,725
It's different than an override.

192
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:50,550
Taxpayers will pay for it for the life of the bond.

193
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:56,035
I think it was something like $10 or less per month to do this debt exclusion.

194
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:03,495
It's, we limited it to a 20 million plus facility.

195
00:19:03,515 --> 00:19:07,536
30 million will be after full construction costs.

196
00:19:07,556 --> 00:19:09,477
30 million is kind of where we set the limit.

197
00:19:10,077 --> 00:19:22,342
But I agree, I'm pretty, I am frustrated with, it's, you know what, it's probably just one, two, maybe three union representatives that are coming out against this question.

198
00:19:24,256 --> 00:19:36,202
And I did watch one of the videos and it was then yesterday after watching the video I did some just looking back at old emails and I what was said is even it's even more concerning.

199
00:19:37,582 --> 00:19:43,385
We, and I'll send you all these documents and I'm going to make them public because I want the community to understand, you know,

200
00:19:44,644 --> 00:19:46,865
what is actually, what the facts are.

201
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:55,149
I have emails dating back to 2023 and the subject line from the prior chief was new headquarters committee.

202
00:19:55,169 --> 00:20:12,416
And on that committee, on that new committee, so obviously there was one beforehand, you had deputy Che, you had deputy Gilberti, you had Lieutenant Casella, you had Lieutenant Mon, you had firefighter Buckley, you had firefighter Spinelli.

203
00:20:13,157 --> 00:20:13,957
And this email was,

204
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:20,399
to let them know we're beginning the process of working on the beginning stages of the headquarter design.

205
00:20:20,599 --> 00:20:28,641
Each team member should go over the materials in the program book and make recommendations and notes and mark these up for space inside the headquarters.

206
00:20:30,042 --> 00:20:36,283
So from that email, I'm just, you know, I was perplexed at what I happened to be listening to the day before.

207
00:20:37,283 --> 00:20:43,445
You know, he says, I look forward to working with our team, getting your technical assistance and feedback on the current and future needs of the headquarters.

208
00:20:44,461 --> 00:20:53,684
And one of the claims they made in that video is that no input was sought from any firefighters or people that would be using the building.

209
00:20:53,784 --> 00:20:54,444
Is that right?

210
00:20:55,105 --> 00:20:55,505
That's right.

211
00:20:55,525 --> 00:20:56,405
That's correct.

212
00:20:56,545 --> 00:20:59,906
They were excluded from the design.

213
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:01,267
They were planned.

214
00:21:01,287 --> 00:21:03,628
They were excluded from the process.

215
00:21:06,153 --> 00:21:07,494
I wasn't aware they were excluded.

216
00:21:07,575 --> 00:21:15,281
We had meetings monthly and we invited the deputies, the chief of the fire department was always on those meetings.

217
00:21:15,721 --> 00:21:20,545
And during those meetings, they talked about the projects at each individual station and they talked about the fire headquarters.

218
00:21:21,366 --> 00:21:23,007
So was the union invited?

219
00:21:23,027 --> 00:21:32,975
I don't know other than I know three members of the union were invited to be on this new fire headquarters building team back March 7th, 2023 from

220
00:21:36,450 --> 00:21:37,271
the chief at the time.

221
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:45,193
And then you go on to emails that were starting in 2024.

222
00:21:45,234 --> 00:21:51,316
And that's when Chief Evans, who's now the current chief, came on board.

223
00:21:51,336 --> 00:21:56,678
And there's additional emails where

224
00:21:57,955 --> 00:22:03,498
the chief is thanking the president of the union, I appreciate your input regarding the new fire headquarters.

225
00:22:04,519 --> 00:22:15,024
I would appreciate a confirmation from the union at this time, would you be okay moving forward in removing the fire tower in favor of increasing the living space?

226
00:22:15,605 --> 00:22:25,530
And at that time, I got a call from the chief and he said, the union is not interested in the, they would rather more living space than a training tower and I said,

227
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,562
I don't feel comfortable taking out the training tower.

228
00:22:28,662 --> 00:22:31,623
This is something they've been asking for for a long time.

229
00:22:32,104 --> 00:22:34,565
Is it the largest training tower?

230
00:22:34,585 --> 00:22:34,625
No.

231
00:22:35,046 --> 00:22:36,386
Is it ideal?

232
00:22:37,087 --> 00:22:39,629
No, because it probably should be on a separate location.

233
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:43,171
But we did that when I was a counselor.

234
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:44,191
We met with the state.

235
00:22:44,251 --> 00:22:44,912
We were trying to get a

236
00:22:47,145 --> 00:23:07,591
Caroline Miller, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen Hollweg, OSBT-Karen

237
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:26,335
So then I did get an email from the president of the union, and it said, we do feel the space could be used to improve the living conditions in the building.

238
00:23:26,815 --> 00:23:31,177
So at that point, once I had that in writing, we took out the training tower.

239
00:23:31,197 --> 00:23:36,659
And from that video, I believe we fixed almost every concern they had.

240
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:43,462
The chief met, this is an email from April, Friday, April 12th, 2024.

241
00:23:45,335 --> 00:23:48,857
And it's an email to our architect.

242
00:23:49,438 --> 00:24:02,947
Yesterday, a group of firefighters that had been involved with planning, discussing the headquarters with Chief Friedman early in the process, met with me to voice concerns about storage space and then another few items.

243
00:24:03,507 --> 00:24:06,249
So the architect writes back, OK, we'll look at that.

244
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:07,269
We'll make adjustments.

245
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:08,570
And what did they do?

246
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,791
They made adjustments.

247
00:24:10,992 --> 00:24:11,172
Hi.

248
00:24:14,558 --> 00:24:25,280
They made, they revisited the, this is an email from May 3rd, we revisited the floor plan, floor, the plans and site plans, all based on our meeting with the chief a few weeks ago.

249
00:24:26,241 --> 00:24:32,662
We've been able to add some square footage and storage bases that he and his team walked us through at that meeting.

250
00:24:33,302 --> 00:24:37,463
So there's members of the union that had a meeting with the chief and the architect

251
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:40,924
They walked through and then adjustments were made.

252
00:24:41,404 --> 00:24:45,265
We adjusted the drawings to accommodate what we believe all the needs are.

253
00:24:46,425 --> 00:24:59,068
So it sounds like a lot of evidence that shows that you actually did work together with them, that they kind of signed off on some of these changes that they're now saying are things that they wanted and don't have in this new design.

254
00:25:00,048 --> 00:25:00,268
Right.

255
00:25:00,328 --> 00:25:03,529
And all of these things were, you know, cc'd.

256
00:25:03,649 --> 00:25:05,110
All the deputies were cc'd.

257
00:25:05,330 --> 00:25:06,690
President Buckley was cc'd.

258
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:12,859
Lieutenant Marcellino, Friar Friar Spinelli, they were all CC'd on this.

259
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:24,970
And the follow-up email was actually from Lieutenant Marcellino, who wrote on May 4th, 2024, this is marked improvement.

260
00:25:25,310 --> 00:25:30,094
Thank you for facilitating the meeting and working to get the changes made.

261
00:25:31,997 --> 00:25:38,062
Wow, and that's the person who made the speech that we can watch on allmedford.com, yeah.

262
00:25:38,342 --> 00:25:49,772
So it's out, so you're offering them, like, you're working with them and designing this new headquarters, putting in this question in the ballot to get the funding for that, and they're saying no.

263
00:25:50,212 --> 00:25:52,154
Like, it seems like there's more to this story.

264
00:25:52,194 --> 00:25:56,358
Like, is there more going on that you think is important for folks to understand?

265
00:25:56,378 --> 00:25:59,060
I think there is, and I,

266
00:26:00,263 --> 00:26:15,554
For me, like I said before, it's one or two, maybe three union representatives that are coming out strongly against this debt exclusion, which seems crazy to me because we need this funding to be able to build a brand new facility.

267
00:26:17,653 --> 00:26:28,305
I don't think, and not that anybody else from the department besides the chief or maybe the deputies will come out in support of this, because people are going to lay low, they're going to listen to their union reps.

268
00:26:28,946 --> 00:26:34,852
But I think the majority of our firefighters are probably perplexed as well.

269
00:26:35,453 --> 00:26:36,854
And I think they're being led in a

270
00:26:38,353 --> 00:26:42,595
bad direction if they are gonna show their support against a debt exclusion.

271
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:46,658
This debt exclusion isn't just for the three union leaders that might be against it.

272
00:26:47,238 --> 00:26:56,063
This debt exclusion is for the majority of our department who is out there doing the right thing, coming to work, working hard, keeping our city safe.

273
00:26:56,744 --> 00:27:00,926
And this new building is for the hundreds that are gonna work after them.

274
00:27:01,927 --> 00:27:05,509
The fact that there are some issues in the fire department and in some,

275
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:11,353
some issues between the union and I as far as I manage 26 departments.

276
00:27:11,794 --> 00:27:13,855
I manage 400 employees.

277
00:27:13,875 --> 00:27:19,357
I lead with knowing that accountability has to be at the forefront and I am.

278
00:27:19,457 --> 00:27:24,620
I am holding people accountable, not just in the fire department, throughout the entire city.

279
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,281
Please come to work.

280
00:27:26,541 --> 00:27:28,061
Please call out sick when you're sick.

281
00:27:28,422 --> 00:27:29,682
If you're not sick, come to work.

282
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,504
If you just do the right thing and

283
00:27:33,595 --> 00:27:40,443
HAB-Juliette Boone, Moderator, The Cooperative Extension Office of the City of Santa Clara City Council and the City of Santa Clara City Council.

284
00:27:46,117 --> 00:27:56,642
I don't believe they want to be managed by somebody, especially one that holds accountability as the most important thing to make a city stronger, to make a department stronger.

285
00:27:56,662 --> 00:28:02,985
And I'm holding them accountable so much because we all know what happened the weekends of February 2nd through the 6th.

286
00:28:03,225 --> 00:28:06,747
We had almost the entire department call out sick.

287
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:11,369
Most of them called out sick for their first half of their shift.

288
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:13,630
Thank goodness, because then they were able to do overtime.

289
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:20,445
what they did was cost us $100,000 in overtime and sick time use.

290
00:28:21,265 --> 00:28:25,747
And what they really did, and more important than the money, is that they risked the safety of our community.

291
00:28:27,908 --> 00:28:32,569
And since that time, sick time has been a real issue.

292
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:39,432
You know, Chief is working hard, I'm working hard to try to bring some accountability and try to make them understand that

293
00:28:40,825 --> 00:28:43,406
not even the sick time, but just the culture in the department.

294
00:28:44,187 --> 00:28:50,270
I was told by my consultant that if I didn't fix the culture and the dysfunction within the department, that somebody would get hurt.

295
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:56,513
Now I wasn't told it would be a resident or firefighter, but I'm taking it extremely seriously.

296
00:28:57,093 --> 00:29:00,354
And I know there's conflict and I wish I could fix that.

297
00:29:01,375 --> 00:29:06,597
But I asked the president of the union after that week and I said, listen, here are some of the personnel issues.

298
00:29:06,758 --> 00:29:07,638
And we talked about them.

299
00:29:08,031 --> 00:29:12,413
We talked about them quite a bit, 10, 12 personnel issues that I was really concerned about.

300
00:29:12,973 --> 00:29:16,235
And after that, I said, I want you to be part of the solution.

301
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:22,898
I want you, myself, and a new chief to work to change the culture in the department.

302
00:29:23,839 --> 00:29:25,360
Work with me, not against me.

303
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,801
He's choosing to work against me.

304
00:29:28,421 --> 00:29:35,825
He's choosing to work against the chief of fire, who is really working hard to build a better department.

305
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:45,946
You know, when we have to give out 29 letters saying to people, you know, we are watching your sick time, we're concerned.

306
00:29:45,966 --> 00:29:52,329
You know, we have a few people that are calling out upwards of a third to a half of their shifts.

307
00:29:55,090 --> 00:30:00,513
So for me, it's not even just accountability and making sure our firefighters and our community is safe and that nobody gets hurt.

308
00:30:00,813 --> 00:30:04,255
It's how much money are we spending on overtime that

309
00:30:05,831 --> 00:30:07,011
we could be given to our schools.

310
00:30:07,752 --> 00:30:15,214
What are we showing the multiple people we have in the academy and the 11 that we're doing background checks on now to hire?

311
00:30:15,674 --> 00:30:20,856
So that's upwards of 15 new firefighters we'll have on staff in the next six to nine months.

312
00:30:21,576 --> 00:30:27,838
What message are we showing to those 15 and to our younger generation of firefighters that are already in the department?

313
00:30:28,497 --> 00:30:37,945
If we're just, you know, at odds and fighting over like accountability and we have some people that are just calling out sick all the time.

314
00:30:39,166 --> 00:30:40,047
It's not, it's not right.

315
00:30:40,107 --> 00:30:43,349
It's not fair, you know, and it's something that I'm determined to fix.

316
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:44,831
Yeah.

317
00:30:44,851 --> 00:30:48,694
So what I asked the residents of the community is watch that video.

318
00:30:49,777 --> 00:30:54,899
And then take a listen to this podcast and read these emails that I'm going to release.

319
00:30:55,399 --> 00:30:56,640
And you make up your own mind.

320
00:30:56,820 --> 00:31:03,082
I think that video ended with, we don't want to come off as a bunch of angry people that don't like anything.

321
00:31:03,642 --> 00:31:17,508
And I'm not going to comment on my opinion, but I think our residents are smart enough to know that they can form their own opinion on that if they did 20 minutes of homework, maybe 30 minutes of listening to this podcast.

322
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:29,533
Because it's those three people that may lose an opportunity for our entire department, not just current, but future, to have a brand new fire headquarters.

323
00:31:30,614 --> 00:31:33,296
I'm sorry there's not five bays, there's only four.

324
00:31:33,736 --> 00:31:36,898
I'm sorry that we didn't have enough storage space or bathroom space.

325
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:41,773
in the original plans that we've now fixed and we do.

326
00:31:42,433 --> 00:31:44,915
I'm sorry that I put a training tower in.

327
00:31:44,955 --> 00:31:46,176
I thought that's what they wanted.

328
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:49,558
I'm sorry it wasn't perfect enough, but I took it out when they asked me to.

329
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,661
I don't know what else I can do.

330
00:31:53,421 --> 00:32:02,167
And there's no way I would ever just stop holding people accountable so that I could get them to stop fighting me.

331
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:04,469
I mean, I can't even breathe right.

332
00:32:04,948 --> 00:32:09,431
The grievances, the injunctions, the charges, every day it's something.

333
00:32:10,512 --> 00:32:10,932
Every day.

334
00:32:10,992 --> 00:32:15,535
And every time I hold somebody accountable, it's another nasty post about me online.

335
00:32:15,555 --> 00:32:18,817
And it is what it is.

336
00:32:19,077 --> 00:32:19,857
I have thick skin.

337
00:32:20,218 --> 00:32:21,338
I'm doing it for a reason.

338
00:32:21,458 --> 00:32:32,485
And I'm going to continue to build this department to a place where I know it should and can be, especially when the majority of our firefighters, like I said, are doing the right thing.

339
00:32:34,378 --> 00:32:42,562
You know, and I'm sure that there's internal issues going on, and I'm assuming that they're questioning the leadership of their own union.

340
00:32:42,902 --> 00:32:43,582
I'm sure they are.

341
00:32:43,882 --> 00:32:45,323
They have to be.

342
00:32:45,663 --> 00:32:48,804
They have to be, and I'm understanding of that.

343
00:32:50,305 --> 00:33:00,889
But I will, I'll ask the president again, one more time, if he wants to be part of the solution with the chief and I, because I think he has a great amount of pull in that union.

344
00:33:03,072 --> 00:33:04,215
I think he could be the game changer.

345
00:33:06,004 --> 00:33:06,304
Thank you.

346
00:33:06,324 --> 00:33:08,506
And I think this is really helpful information.

347
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:14,410
And I appreciate your like, sort of offering these ways of thinking about it and help and you know, allowing people to make their own choices.

348
00:33:15,791 --> 00:33:18,553
I think it's, you know, all really helpful stuff to know.

349
00:33:19,013 --> 00:33:25,518
And does like, it does make the situation like the nuance of the situation seem a little bit more understandable.

350
00:33:26,359 --> 00:33:28,460
Well, under, I don't know if understandable is the right word.

351
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,601
It's not very rational.

352
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:33,644
But yeah, well, I think I think it's, it's, I

353
00:33:34,124 --> 00:33:49,292
it's almost to a point when reading these emails after watching that video, it's almost to the point where I feel bad that I have to, you know, go public with all this because not only does it ruin people's credibility, it ruins the credibility of that, you know, the group they spoke at.

354
00:33:52,033 --> 00:33:53,974
Yeah, well thank you.

355
00:33:54,034 --> 00:33:55,755
Chelly, was there anything that you wanted to add?

356
00:33:56,451 --> 00:34:02,537
I may just reiterate what kind of we shared at the end of our last episode, which is for me this is a values choice.

357
00:34:02,578 --> 00:34:11,347
This is when you spend money, you communicate to the full community where our values lie and they should absolutely be children, education, public services, and

358
00:34:12,688 --> 00:34:15,449
To me, this should not be a conversation of individual politics.

359
00:34:15,469 --> 00:34:20,251
This is about visioning for the city, best practice and sort of growing up together.

360
00:34:20,411 --> 00:34:22,392
So that's in service of everybody.

361
00:34:22,432 --> 00:34:25,974
And it's absolutely in service of our young ones, our young people and our littles.

362
00:34:26,454 --> 00:34:28,935
I don't see this as a, this should not be.

363
00:34:29,035 --> 00:34:32,357
It feels very Medford that a loud minority is allowing this to be.

364
00:34:33,397 --> 00:34:38,619
to cloud, you know, it just feels like bullying and it feels like interfering with forward movement.

365
00:34:38,759 --> 00:34:48,183
So I agree that a small amount of applied homework should help folks to think about where they sit personally across the board.

366
00:34:48,903 --> 00:34:49,984
Yeah, and people have a choice.

367
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:51,284
There's three questions.

368
00:34:51,324 --> 00:34:55,626
You have the debt exclusion, and you have two financial questions that we split for a reason.

369
00:34:55,986 --> 00:35:01,749
I'm not naive to think that every single person in this community can afford this increase.

370
00:35:02,109 --> 00:35:08,732
There is a calculator on the bestmedford.com people can go to and calculate what their home's worth and how much they'll have to pay.

371
00:35:08,752 --> 00:35:11,133
And they have to make educated decisions.

372
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:17,857
But for those that can afford it, and I mean, $38 a month, it's a no-brainer to me.

373
00:35:18,943 --> 00:35:25,290
I ask the people that they trust in the school committee, myself, the city council to manage the budgets as best we can.

374
00:35:27,984 --> 00:35:33,306
along with holding people accountable and just holding our departments accountable to make sure the money is spent wisely.

375
00:35:33,826 --> 00:35:35,646
Of course, nothing's perfect.

376
00:35:35,806 --> 00:35:36,567
I'm not perfect.

377
00:35:37,287 --> 00:35:45,630
Nobody's perfect, but we are doing our best to manage and make sure that there's no waste in our schools or our city.

378
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:49,891
We've come a very long way, and that's the reason why I have

379
00:35:50,871 --> 00:35:52,512
you know, put my support behind this.

380
00:35:53,293 --> 00:35:58,537
That's why I've agreed with the task force to go to the $7.5 million plus the debt exclusion.

381
00:35:59,018 --> 00:35:59,538
It's time.

382
00:35:59,899 --> 00:36:03,402
You know, we're going to have a new high school, hopefully, in the next five years.

383
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:07,065
And we need staff in those schools.

384
00:36:07,185 --> 00:36:10,848
We need our mental health, especially since the pandemic, within our schools.

385
00:36:10,908 --> 00:36:12,790
We need those supports in our schools.

386
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:16,893
And I'm thankful that, you know, you invited me on this podcast.

387
00:36:16,913 --> 00:36:18,935
It's just the start of me speaking out.

388
00:36:19,475 --> 00:36:44,644
and being candid and honest and I'm sure there's things I can do to improve and with not only the relationship with the, you know, the few fire union members and I but also just as mayor and I will continue to strive to do better but please don't let, you know, a couple people determine, you know, the future and the present of what could be.

389
00:36:44,664 --> 00:36:45,404
Yeah.

390
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,541
Yeah, a couple of very loud people.

391
00:36:47,601 --> 00:36:52,263
So I appreciate you having the time and coming on and explaining a lot of this to us.

392
00:36:52,323 --> 00:37:06,210
I think also the investment folks talked to us about different ways for seniors to figure out how to make this work or get sort of help with their taxes should they go up in a way that's unaffordable for them.

393
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:09,972
And also, I think your point about the new high school,

394
00:37:10,652 --> 00:37:15,235
is like we want to keep people here to so that they get their kids get to enjoy that high school.

395
00:37:15,275 --> 00:37:27,862
And so I think, you know, slowly improving and, you know, focusing on improving all these programs will help to keep people in Medford so they can keep enjoying everything that Medford will continue to become.

396
00:37:27,942 --> 00:37:32,085
So yeah, anything else you want to make sure that you mentioned before we wrap up?

397
00:37:32,927 --> 00:37:34,607
No, thank you both for having me today.

398
00:37:34,928 --> 00:37:46,390
Thank you to, I know it looks like we did a long segment, but thank you for listening, and thank you for really taking your time to research these questions, and I encourage people to vote in favor of them.

399
00:37:46,870 --> 00:38:00,074
I encourage them to block out the noise, especially when they listen to this podcast and do some research on their own, make an educated decision, because our future's in the taxpayer and voters' hands.

400
00:38:01,183 --> 00:38:02,928
appreciate everybody willing to support.

401
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,813
Well, thank you.

402
00:38:04,833 --> 00:38:06,097
Thank you.

403
00:38:06,478 --> 00:38:07,060
Thank you so much.

404
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:07,722
This was excellent.

405
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:16,982
Thanks so much for listening to today's episode.
