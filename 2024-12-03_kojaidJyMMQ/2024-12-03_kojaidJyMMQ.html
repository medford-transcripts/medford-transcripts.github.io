<a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=581.831s">Now</a>  you're seeing lifetime sports where you're seeing people using crew to go to the next level in academia, and then taking that to the next level and really promoting something that's really healthy and positive in our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=596.3s">So</a>  I know I'm winded, but I just wanted to <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=599.961s">I</a>  had the vision when this came forth of when this started, when I was on the school committee and seeing where it is today, just amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=608.648s">I</a>  like so much pride with all the medals on our athletes and coaches standing there stoically and I appreciate all this hard work. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=616.915s">So</a>  thank you and congratulations.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=621.099s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Starkelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=630.712s">Councilor</a>  say, thank you.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=632.513s">Um,</a>  Councilor Scarpelli spoke to the beginning of the crew program. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=637.495s">Um,</a>  I was there when it was really ramping up really building up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=640.917s">Um,</a>  and I know that for most of my friends that crew. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=646.345s">put</a>  so many hours into it woke up so early, so many hours after school training and gym outside of practice as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=653.192s">I</a>  know how much work it takes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=656.275s">It's</a>  something that I can't I can't do myself so hats off to you all. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=661.861s">I</a>  also know, looking at all my friends and seeing their love for CRU, that CRU is home for so many people. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=669.065s">And</a>  I'm just so happy that a program that so many of our students call home has gotten this really splendid, really, really amazing achievement and recognition of the hard work and the community that you all have built together. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=687.839s">You</a>  know, I think as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, as Vice President Collins mentioned, this is really bringing pride to our city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=697.606s">This</a>  is something our city can unite around, can be proud of, and you've made it happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=704.21s">And</a>  I think for that, all of us here on this side of the rail are very, very, very grateful for that hard work that you've put into everything. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=716.124s">know,</a>  Councilor Scarpelli kind of stole my thunder when he said, you know, you got the sports that, you know, I think a generation ago we would have thought were, you know, the normal listing of sports. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=727.307s">And</a>  then you got crew, which, you know, is something so, I think, central to life in Medford, especially with the Mystic in the middle, running through the middle of our city, that I think our residents, our students often take for granted. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=740.151s">But</a>  having gone to college and grad school, you start to realize that not everyone has this opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=747.321s">And</a>  for you guys to really make it shine and to really show everyone how worth it it is to have a program like this, I think that's really stellar. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=758.3s">I</a>  have a lot of friends who've gone on to do crew in college and really thrived there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=763.802s">And</a>  I hope that you carry that energy with you, even when life gets really busy, to find time to do it, even for fun. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=771.144s">It</a>  might be for a college sport, but to really keep up with it and keep making all of us proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=777.585s">I</a>  would be really remiss if I didn't thank the coaches for their hard work that they put into this as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=783.527s">as</a>  well as the parents, because I know, you know, I had parents that really were very, very supportive of my extracurriculars. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=790.01s">I</a>  know there's a lot of work put into it, a lot of work making sure that you can afford what you do, making sure that you can get to your practice, making sure that you have everything you need to succeed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=798.895s">And</a>  I think oftentimes that kind of, that work from the parent's side has gone underappreciated. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=805.278s">So</a>  I wanted to thank you all too. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=807.499s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1232.017s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Lazzaro. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1234.197s">Councilor</a>  Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1238.578s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1239.697s">A</a>  number of us from this council went together. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1244.899s">It</a>  was a great day, a great way to spend a rainy Thanksgiving. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1252.341s">It's</a>  always really exciting to see your home team do well, especially as someone who, you know, I've been involved in Medford High School, the Medford High School scene for such a long time that I can remember, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1269.536s">more</a>  difficult times. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1275.979s">But</a>  you know what, I think this really exemplifies how much work we, the coaches have put into this program, how much work our teachers and the school, public schools have put into our sports here in Medford, that Medford sports is now on the rise. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1293.688s">One</a>  of the most exciting moments of Thanksgiving week was seeing a touchdown happen right in front of us. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1299.664s">And</a>  that's something, you know, we can really hoot and holler about. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1302.407s">So</a>  I'm really pumped for the football team, really pumped for what Medford Sports has in store for the seasons to come, and really grateful, again, for the hard work of the parents, the students, the coaches as well.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1317.34s">I'm</a>  gonna go to Councilor Callahan, then Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1321.101s">Thanks</a>  so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1322.322s">Yes,</a>  it was an excellent time to see a game on Thanksgiving day. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1327.066s">It</a>  was fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1328.107s">Really</a>  great to see some touchdowns. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1330.268s">I</a>  will say as a total band geek that I was sad that I missed the marching band, but it was okay to see a wonderful winning game and an excellent game of football. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1342.338s">Thank</a>  you so much.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1343.919s">And</a>  our next resolution is about the marching band. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1345.821s">So</a>  we'll get to talk about them too. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1347.502s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1349.042s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1350.043s">It</a>  truly was the victory, the first time greater Boston League champion since the early 90s. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1358.047s">First</a>  time announced tonight, first time we've had a greater Boston League MVP and Justin Marino. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1365.291s">So</a>  many kids now coach Curley and his coaching staff ascending off to play at the next level that you have, and you're talking about <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1374.122s">a</a>  group of kids that without football wouldn't have an opportunity to get to the next level. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1378.923s">That's</a>  what's amazing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1381.103s">What</a>  I really want to stress is how impressed I am with the football program for what they do for the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1389.085s">If</a>  you see the wins and Thanksgiving, that's great, touchdowns, and everybody's happy about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1394.246s">What</a>  I find more amazing is what they did the week before when they went to the shelter and they <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1402.99s">They</a>  prepared a couple of the, what am I thinking, Zach? <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1411.241s">The</a>  food, it wasn't the meals, they were doing the different community centers. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1420.973s">Yeah,</a>  so they really, the pantry, excuse me, thank you for helping me with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1424.974s">But</a>  they were setting up the food pantries and helping with stock and share and present that to the community members. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1433.837s">You'll</a>  see them this winter, delivering, shoveling seniors out. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1440.059s">So</a>  what you're seeing right now is a true champion in the sense that, forget about the wins and losses. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1447.99s">Coach</a>  for 32 years, you seldom remember those truly what they're going to remember is what they did as a team and as a family as being part of a community and really giving back to the community so I congratulate coach curly. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1463.221s">Chris</a>  Murphy, who's the President of the Mustang. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1467.669s">football</a>  program and what they do for our community and give them back. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1471.672s">And</a>  I would love to invite them to our next meeting, if we can, Mr. President, to them and our next guests and the band and really celebrate what they've done, both on the field and off. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1483.299s">I</a>  think it's equally important. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1484.66s">So</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1485.981s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1487.081s">Yeah,</a>  and I was hoping we'll reach out, we'll figure out if it's next meeting or maybe in January, <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1493.116s">which</a>  which one we can get people here for but I also just wanted to. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1498.837s">really</a>  appreciate what the program means year round for students and keeping them engaged in the community and involved, not just in football activities, but community activities, community service, and academic success. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1514.426s">It</a>  really is something that not just the football program, the crew team, the band, every program that we have in our city, <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1524.452s">gives</a>  a young person an opportunity to be more involved in their community, or maybe helps make sure they stay involved in their community and stay on track and I think that that is really the great benefit of the vibrant. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1537.532s">activities</a>  that we have arts, sports, music, all of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1541.494s">And</a>  also, I do want to ask Coach Curley, how he's going to replace the GBL MVP and I think now all time Mustang football scoring leader and Justin Marino, it's pretty impressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1551.757s">So,</a>  you know, we can have a little sports fun too. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1556.459s">It's</a>  got a brother in the fifth grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1558.82s">It's</a>  a lot of pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1562.287s">But</a>  yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1566.309s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1567.509s">Any</a>  further discussion on this motion as amended by Councilor Scarpelli to invite representatives from the team or the full team if they can all make it to a future meeting? <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1578.854s">Seeing</a>  none on the motion of Councilor Collins to approve as amended seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1583.956s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1584.456s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1586.32s">second</a>  resolution under suspension, be it resolved that we celebrate and congratulate our Medford Mustang marching band on their NESBA championship. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1594.663s">And</a>  we'll say that that's from Councilor Zahra Callahan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1599.025s">And</a>  just wanted to introduce that our marching band also has seen, I was in the marching band and I sat through I think four consecutive <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1608.052s">four</a>  or five, I think it might've been there even longer than that, consecutive Thanksgiving losses, but it was still awesome. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1615.178s">The</a>  program was still doing community work. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1618.62s">Cheer</a>  Squad was doing great and we were doing well, but it was at a time, Councilor Scarpelli knows we've talked about it, of cuts where we lost our marching director. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1628.528s">We</a>  had one person doing the band. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1630.81s">And</a>  we've seen this really vibrant resurgence over the last 10 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1636.267s">For</a>  better, I mean, thankfully from, but from the parents and from private fundraising to support the band as someone who thinks that it would be great to have the public funds back in those programs that that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1648.331s">All</a>  that extra work doesn't go unnoticed, even though I don't think that needs to happen and I think it can be helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1655.216s">I'd</a>  love to see more support but our band has really seen that resurgence to in recent years winning multiple NSBA championships. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1663.502s">And,</a>  you know, my senior year we didn't have we didn't march. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1668.188s">You</a>  know that that's how bad it had gotten we had a field show but we stood in place and we performed it or we performed it from the stands and now you have a color guard, and you have percussion and you have electronically amplified instruments and all these things and new uniforms, all of these things that we didn't have. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1687.307s">Yeah,</a>  and they're doing the tree and wreath sale to support the Medford Mustang Marching Band as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1692.529s">So</a>  thanks to everyone for letting me go on first on this one, but it is a real passion of mine. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1698.71s">I</a>  want to celebrate them too and hope that someone will amend to invite them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1704.412s">I'm</a>  going to go to Councilor Tseng and then Councilor Zahra.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1708.273s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1708.593s">I'd</a>  be happy to make that amendment. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1711.974s">I</a>  think my fellow councilors know how I was <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1715.069s">I</a>  was involved a lot more with the art scene growing up and seeing the marching band through its many iterations, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1723.936s">I</a>  remember the marching band as President Bears described it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1728.239s">I</a>  remember the marching band as it was growing as well with a new band director, with new uniforms, equipment, things really, really ramping up. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1739.288s">I</a>  think we're <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1740.856s">the</a>  recent successes of the marching band, the year after year successes of the marching band really show, I mean, one thing, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1749.102s">Like</a>  pride to the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1750.643s">Another</a>  thing is the result of community investment into the arts, into building a community for our students where they can really thrive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1758.228s">And</a>  the third thing that comes to mind for me especially is just the importance of building a home for our students to have their energies <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1769.189s">their</a>  creative energies their expressive energies channeled into a place where they can feel safe and we're. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1777.589s">where</a>  when you do that, when you do that, you not only help that child succeed, but you help our city succeed as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1786.174s">And</a>  so I'm really, really grateful for the teachers, for the band directors, for all the parents who make this happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1794.9s">Because,</a>  again, I've seen it from the other side, from the student side, and I know how much work there is there that goes unsaid. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1802.665s">I've</a>  talked to the teachers after rehearsals are done. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1807.108s">you</a>  know, it's, they're tired, but they're, they're right on their next lesson plan. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1812.511s">I,</a>  I've talked to, I have a lot of friends who are in bands, especially as well, and they're the reason why President Bears and Councilor Scarpelli can, can sing the fight song right on the spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1826.478s">As</a>  they have before.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1830.28s">I'll</a>  share, I'll share, I'll share with everybody.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1834.302s">But,</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1837.639s">But</a>  you know, it goes to show that investments, the investments that we make as a community in our schools, especially in our extracurriculars, which so often fall by the wayside, are so, so important in building a stronger and more thriving community.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1854.884s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Tseng. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1857.584s">I'm</a>  gonna go to Councilor Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1860.389s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1861.27s">I</a>  think you can tell how much the City Council relishes an opportunity to talk about our schools. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1868.474s">We</a>  don't get that many chances, but it's exciting when we have something to celebrate like this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1873.977s">But</a>  I do really agree and want to reiterate how important it is for students in our public schools to have opportunities to try different things, find the thing that <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1886.944s">they</a>  fit in with and that they can thrive in, whatever that thing is, if it's sports, if it's music, if it's art, if it's some seemingly random or counterintuitive activity that makes them really happy and makes them feel like they have a place, that's what makes kids thrive. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1906.674s">So</a>  the importance of these kinds of successes for our students can't be overstated. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1913.537s">So</a>  I'm just very excited about <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1915.959s">these</a>  resolutions coming forward and these celebrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1919.026s">So</a>  thanks.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1920.89s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=1921.271s">Go</a>  to Councilor Callahan.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2161.974s">I</a>  had some phone calls after and I think that the biggest concern was the private process of tree removal. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2170.437s">Residents</a>  were really concerned with <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2172.369s">their</a>  freedoms and what they have control on their properties. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2175.912s">And</a>  I think that at the time KP law did say that that could be viewed as taking. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2181.836s">So</a>  I know that that's something that will be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2184.138s">And</a>  I think that as people ask me, this is the process, it's gonna be vetted through the process and we'll get a clearer understanding as we move forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2192.324s">So</a>  thank you for that, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2793.021s">I</a>  will go to Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2886.112s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2887.373s">Motions,</a>  orders, and resolutions. <a href="../resolutions/24-503.pdf"><font color="green">24-503</font></a> offered by Councilor Lazzaro, President Bears, and Vice President Collins.
 <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2894.057s">Let</a>  me get the full language here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2900.782s">Whereas</a>  speed is one of the most important factors in traffic safety and crashes that occur at lower speeds cause less injury. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2907.606s">And</a>  whereas a pedestrian hit by a car traveling 40 miles per hour has a one in 10 chance of surviving a crash, while a pedestrian hit by a car traveling at 20 miles per hour has a nine in 10 chance of surviving. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2919.213s">And</a>  whereas Medford has set a citywide speed limit of 25 miles per hour on city controlled streets. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2924.915s">and</a>  whereas Medford has a high proportion of state-controlled roads, including Mystic Valley and Alewife Brook Parkways, Route 16, Route 28, Route 38, and High Street, Route 60, which are Medford's busiest thoroughfares, connecting Medford, the surrounding towns, and I-93, and passing through residential and commercial areas, impacting the safety of people walking, cycling, taking transit, and driving to school, work, parks, grocery stores, natural spaces, and city squares. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2950.776s">excuse</a>  me, and whereas Massachusetts general law chapter 90 section 18 allows city councils to petition state agencies to modify the speed limit on a state highway within their geographic boundaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2961.44s">Now,</a>  therefore, be it resolved by the Medford city council that we respect the request and recommend that the Massachusetts department of conservation and recreation, DCR and Massachusetts department of transportation, MassDOT set the speed limit on route 16, route 28, route 38 and route 60 in Medford at 25 miles per hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2976.325s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2982.947s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=2984.388s">This</a>  is an issue that was brought to my attention by some local concerned citizens who, in particular, we were talking about Route 16 close to the Whole Foods where the guardrail has been crashed into and replaced so many times that it has its own Instagram account. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3008.89s">Um,</a>  it's, uh, it's while we were walking through that intersection, we witnessed at least two, at least two extremely illegal and dangerous traffic violations that we pointed to, and we were like, like that, like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3026.156s">It</a>  just kept happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3027.757s">Um,</a>  people drive really fast on Route 16 in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3030.718s">Um,</a>  and then, uh, as I was looking into it, I discovered what the other, <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3037.18s">that</a>  are controlled by state agencies. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3041.403s">This</a>  causes a lot of complications when we try to increase the safety of our roadways. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3047.907s">But,</a>  um. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3050.068s">I</a>  wanted to make a couple of notes on this resolution after looking into it and discussing the matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3056.852s">Um</a>  a couple of these roadways are now under local <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3066.898s">So</a>  we can if we can amend that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3071.04s">Or</a>  I'm not sure if we need to amend it really the the mass general law chapter 90 section 18 says that we can basically petition those agencies to change their sections. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3082.565s">So</a>  really, all we're doing is we're saying <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3085.606s">DCR,</a>  can you lower the speed limit of the roads that you control, mainly route 16 and 38 and 28, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3102.205s">are</a>  up around 35 miles per hour is the limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3105.206s">And</a>  people do drive faster than that, of course. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3107.927s">But</a>  it's just like anything, we're not in charge of how people break the laws, we're only in charge of what the laws are. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3112.428s">So</a>  if we would like to move forward with it, we would say, we would ask these state agencies to change their, those roadways speed limits. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3123.792s">And</a>  what that does is, <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3128.527s">lessens</a>  the likelihood that a crash would be a fatal crash. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3133.432s">And</a>  that is the hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3135.834s">It</a>  is a small step, but it is hopefully something in the direction of greater safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3141.399s">And</a>  I wanted to say thank you to <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3145.543s">Walk</a>  Medford, Ellery Klein of Walk Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3147.944s">We</a>  had a ton of support from the Medford Bike Commission, Emily O'Brien. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3154.728s">We</a>  had support from Patricia, Senator Patricia Jalen's office, Matt Hartman, her chief of staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3160.831s">We</a>  had a big group of people that did this walking. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3163.692s">of</a>  that intersection, but we talked a lot about there are a lot of really interested people and, um, traffic safety and just safety of human beings moving through the city is, of course, not I don't think it's very contentious issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3176.319s">Um</a>  so people do want to be safe where they live and work and travel. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3180.921s">So</a>  this is a this is something that I think can At least move in the direction of achieving that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3188.545s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3191.425s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3192.946s">I</a>  will go to Councilor Callahan and then Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3195.789s">But</a>  just before I do that, it might be worth the amendment being, saying Route 16, Route 28, Route 38, Route 60, and any other streets or highways controlled by state agencies, something like that as an amendment, just to be a catch-all.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3218.28s">sorry,</a>  what I do wonder is if we would, if it would behoove us to ever take anything out of it, like we might as well just say anything that's state controlled, ask that the agency is lower the speed limit to 25 miles per hour.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3229.063s">Yeah,</a>  because I off the top of my head I'm thinking of South Border Road, Elm Street, Highland Avenue.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3233.844s">Exactly.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3234.264s">And</a>  there's a couple of other state, there's a Valley Parkway that's not part of Route 16 by the lakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3241.026s">I</a>  mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3242.606s">Someone</a>  said that I think Medford has the second highest proportion of state-controlled roads after Boston, which is pretty wild, but we do have a lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3250.572s">And</a>  38 is partially city, partially state. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3253.034s">I</a>  think 60 is the only one that's all under city control. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3255.797s">So</a>  I think a catch-all amendment might be worth.</p>

    <p>[Lazzaro]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3259.34s">I</a>  think that you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3260.34s">Rather</a>  than eliminating some that are technically city-controlled, to maybe just say any and all state-controlled roads, we petition that they be lowered to 25.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3272.051s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3272.872s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3273.834s">I'll</a>  go to Councilor Callahan and then Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Callahan]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3279.437s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3280.477s">I</a>  love the idea of having a catch all. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3282.818s">I</a>  was going to ask that we specifically mention South Border Road because there are a number of residents on the upper part of governors who have for many years been complaining about the safety issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3292.361s">They're</a>  really concerned about their kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3295.743s">You</a>  know lots of very fast traffic because of South Border Road. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3299.104s">So</a>  I hope we can leave some specific mention of things as well as having a catch all and I would love to have South Border Road specifically called out in this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3309.65s">Thanks.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3310.651s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Kelly, and I'll go to Vice President Collins.</p>

    <p>[Collins]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3314.774s">Thank</a>  you, President Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3316.055s">Councilor</a>  Lazzaro, thank you so much for putting this forward and to all of the collaborators from the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3321.3s">I</a>  know that we have been hearing from safety advocates in the community for a long time about this, and I'm glad that we're doing this one small step towards a potential solution. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3335.252s">I</a>  think this one is really simple. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3336.573s">You</a>  know, we have a 25 mile per hour speed limit on city managed roads for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3343.498s">We</a>  struggle to maintain and enforce that speed limit on city roads as it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3348.523s">I</a>  heard a couple speeding complaints from residents twice in the past two days, and that was before the meeting started. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3354.447s">And</a>  then we heard about more traffic issues on Salem, about the lack of safety on Salem Street as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3359.812s">So</a>  we really need the state's help in creating a culture of safe road speeds here in Medford and around the region, because it's just intuitive, you know, people whip on the roads in Medford, they whip on the state roads, and they bring that speed to the neighborhoods, and it's incredibly dangerous, it's incredibly scary. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3377.142s">So</a>  I hope that this will send a really clear message to DCR and DOT that Medford wants this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3386.731s">We</a>  do not want this fast traffic from these state roads bleeding into the neighborhoods anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3392.436s">So</a>  thank you so much for putting this together and thank you so much to everybody in the community who's been raising the alarm about this as well for a long time.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3400.236s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Collins. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3401.357s">Yeah,</a>  as someone who grew up on a state road, Fells Bay West, but has spent many years <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3410.751s">looking</a>  out my driver's side mirror or looking left and right across the street, worried that someone's going to come whipping down Fells Bay West in the one-way section at 45 miles an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3420.001s">And</a>  they have taken out two of our cars and a tree in that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3425.087s">And</a>  luckily, no people, but that's probably only because there's no crosswalks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3429.291s">And</a>  the only thing <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3431.173s">To</a>  our West is 93. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3432.935s">There's</a>  other parts that are even much more dangerous. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3437.018s">I'm</a>  a huge supporter of this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3438.579s">I'm</a>  also directly experienced what it's like to lose someone in another community, not in Medford to traffic violence so <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3448.807s">Yeah,</a>  it's just important to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3450.689s">And</a>  I have here a suggested amendment in the last sentence, set the speed limit on any street, highway, or portion of a street or highway controlled by a state agency, including but not limited to Route 16, Route 28, Route 38, Route 60, South Border Road, Elm Street, and Highland Ave in Medford at 25 miles per hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3474.508s">Sound</a>  good? <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3476.75s">You'll</a>  make that amendment? <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3480.402s">I</a>  wrote it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3483.844s">On</a>  the motion of Councilor Lazzaro to approve the resolution as amended, seconded by Councilor Callahan, is there any further discussion by members of the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3494.77s">Seeing</a>  none, any discussion by members of the public? <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3497.512s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3498.432s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please, and you have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Klein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3501.82s">Hello.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3502.581s">My</a>  name is Ellery Klein. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3504.743s">I'm</a>  37 Fells Avenue and chair of Walk Medford and also a member of the Safe Routes to School Medford Citywide Task Force, which was formed last year. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3514.495s">And</a>  I've been a walking and biking to school leader now for 11 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3519.681s">So</a>  I have been asking for this for a while. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3522.124s">This</a>  was made a change in state law in 2023, thanks to many advocates. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3529.692s">As</a>  we've said, we've had this 25 mile an hour speed limit here for years and years. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3534.937s">yet</a>  we have all these state roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3537.82s">So</a>  I thank you so much for finally bringing this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3540.882s">I</a>  know we were busy with the overrides, so it's great that this got right on the plate. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3544.986s">I</a>  will just say that, you know, if you walk up, I live in Fulton Heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3549.99s">If</a>  you start at Wellington, you know, you're looking at the road down there by the shopping centers where people are waiting for the buses with no protection, no bollards, nothing, and people are whipping by at 45 miles an hour because the speed limit is 35 down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3562.521s">And</a>  then you get to where I live on Fells Way West between Salem and Fulton Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3567.467s">And</a>  we have about 500, 600 kids up in Fulton Heights. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3571.552s">And</a>  we're about to spend, we've already spent, I think, I can't remember, $200,000 on the RFFB. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3578.761s">at</a>  Hickey Park there, and I've seen multiple crashes happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3583.165s">So,</a>  you know, blinking lights don't really help when people are driving 45 miles an hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3588.83s">It's</a>  set at 30, but people whip down that road at incredibly fast speeds. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3595.837s">So</a>  and they were recently serving to do more of the Safer to School grant work. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3600.641s">So</a>  it's gonna be a total of about a million dollars they're gonna spend to supposedly help kids cross. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3605.446s">But</a>  if we don't actually address the speeds on Fells Way West, no kid is ever gonna be able to cross the street to go to school or the park or the square by themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3614.715s">The</a>  parents, if you talk to any parent in the city, <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3618.058s">They</a>  just don't feel safe at all letting their kids walk and bike around themselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3623.103s">But</a>  we are a city that's very compact, and kids should be able to grow up and have the freedom and independence in the city that safety like this would provide. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3631.251s">So</a>  obviously, this would just be a change in the speed limit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3635.775s">But</a>  hopefully, it sends a signal to the state that Medford would like <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3640.9s">these</a>  agencies to take safety seriously. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3643.481s">And</a>  once they have the speed marked, then the pressure is on them to actually engineer the roads and design them so that drivers have to drive these speeds that are safe for our communities. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3657.166s">And</a>  there'll be other effects too with less noise pollution, less exhaust, less crashes, and just generally better quality of life and more community cohesion as people are more able to walk and bike around. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3670.131s">say</a>  hi to their neighbors and smile at babies. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3671.992s">So,</a>  all right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3673.212s">Thank</a>  you so much for this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3675.093s">I</a>  appreciate it.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3676.473s">Thank</a>  you, Ellery. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3677.093s">And</a>  I'd start with less drag racing myself. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3681.615s">If</a>  we have anyone else who'd like to speak in person, you can come to the podium or on Zoom, raise your hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3688.697s">I</a>  do see Mr. Castagnettititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititi on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3691.218s">I</a>  will unmute you, Mr. Castagnettititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititi, name and address for the record, and then we'll go back to the podium. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3702.099s">Mr.</a>  Castagnettititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititi, do you want to speak on this item? <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3709.647s">It</a>  may have been an error in hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3711.109s">Oh,</a>  we got him. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3712.21s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3713.111s">Mr.</a>  Castagnettititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititi, name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3714.492s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3716.587s">Yes,</a>  Andrew Castagnettititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititititi, Cushion Street, Bedford, Massachusetts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3720.89s">I</a>  want to commend and thank Councilor Lazzaro for bringing up a very dangerous spot in that area, that curve on Route 16. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3728.777s">I</a>  think it's near Whole Foods. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3732.4s">Matter</a>  of fact, I think that speed limit, they should have a reduced speed down to like 10 miles per hour, especially if there's ice on that curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3741.027s">It's</a>  a dangerous curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3742.468s">I've</a>  negotiated many times, and once I had <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3745.874s">Very</a>  little success. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3747.054s">I</a>  ended up wiping out in front of Whole Foods. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3749.335s">I</a>  hit the curb. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3750.155s">I</a>  lost two tires back in 1969 while I was commuting to Honeywell in Waltham. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3756.377s">However,</a>  I disagree. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3759.318s">You</a>  should not lower the 35 mile an hour limit, in my opinion, on the other parts of the state roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3765.681s">Because</a>  if you're coming from Boston on Route 28, heading to a station landing, you might be in dangerous, more dangerous, <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3773.695s">troubles</a>  with a speed limit of 25, because they're moving pretty fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3784.202s">The</a>  city itself, it lowered the speed limits, I believe, within the city of 25 miles per hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3790.106s">So</a>  I think it would be an opposite effect. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3795.49s">I</a>  think it would cause more problems on the rest of the roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3798.872s">And</a>  by the way, who would enforce these tickets?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3806.792s">I</a>  believe state police enforces speed on the state-controlled roads.</p>

    <p>[Castagnetti]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3812.695s">Okay,</a>  I said my piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3813.896s">I</a>  think that curve in front of Whole Foods, very dangerous from past experience, I know. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3820.059s">That</a>  could reduce speed down to 10 miles per hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3825.722s">But</a>  the rest of the state highways, I would let it be. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3828.524s">But</a>  I would compromise if I had a choice, if I had the power, instead of 25, maybe go to 30, <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3835.504s">And</a>  in between, we could settle between 25 and 35 miles per hour. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3840.788s">Thank</a>  you for listening. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3841.648s">I</a>  got to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3842.229s">Bye.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3936.965s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3937.546s">We'll</a>  go to Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3938.966s">Emily</a>  Stein from the Safe Roads Alliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3942.507s">Name</a>  and address for the record, please.</p>

    <p>[Stein]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3946.889s">Hi,</a>  I'm Emily Stein, 177 High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3953.073s">And</a>  I just wanted to echo what Ellery and Martha said. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3957.274s">I</a>  run Safe Roads Alliance. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3959.174s">It's</a>  a local nonprofit, mostly focused on educating drivers about how to share the roads with vulnerable road users, people walking and biking. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3968.417s">And</a>  also I focus on distracted driving prevention. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3973.638s">I</a>  was just at the state house today talking to legislators about <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3979.255s">speed,</a>  safety cameras, red light cameras. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3983.481s">And</a>  it seems like this is going to be what we hope will be a lot more municipal opt-in traffic safety measures. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3992.995s">So</a>  it's fantastic. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=3995.057s">If</a>  the Council pushes this forward, it'd be great to have Medford be one of the leads in pushing DCR to lower their speed limits and also kind of weighing in at the Boston Region MPO. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4009.628s">Metropolitan</a>  Planning Organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4012.911s">As</a>  they're developing their Vision Zero action plan, they are wanting to have policies that they can share with other municipalities on how to make their streets safer. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4023.139s">So</a>  if you see these DCR roads as corridors that need full safety improvements along the whole corridors, it's great. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4032.587s">Medford</a>  will be a leader. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4034.409s">So</a>  thank you all, and thank you to the advocates for putting this in.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4041.55s">Thank</a>  you, Emily, and please reach out and let us know, Ellery, to anyone in the city, how we can support further efforts for regional and state coordination on road safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4053.133s">Any</a>  further discussion by members of the Council? <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4055.973s">Seeing</a>  none, I will go to the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4060.495s">Name</a>  and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4061.675s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Vardabedian]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4064.295s">Paulette</a>  Vardabedian, Central Lab. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4067.045s">Thank</a>  you, Emily, for bringing this up because I do agree that the speed limit does need to be lowered, even though we do have 25 mile an hour citywide. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4075.969s">Some</a>  of the roads, even the city roads, they go so fast. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4080.331s">I</a>  travel on South border road a lot and I go the speed limit or a little bit more maybe. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4088.495s">And</a>  I've had people on my butt and people go around me and pass me. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4094.026s">when</a>  I think I'm going at a decent speed and I think it's very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4099.471s">The</a>  other thing too is some of these roads that go into the adjoining towns, we have to <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4105.618s">maybe</a>  try to work with those towns to get that continuous road on the same speed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4112.002s">So</a>  say South Border Road goes into Winchester. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4114.644s">If</a>  we're going to have a 25 mile an hour, which is now 30, go into 25 mile an hour, we want to make sure that it's posted at the Medford-Winchester border. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4124.991s">So</a>  people can't say, oh, it just said it was 30 or something, and maybe get Winchester and or the other towns similar to go in with us on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4135.798s">continuous</a>  road. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4137.819s">So</a>  I think it's a great idea and I hope it passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4141.201s">And</a>  I wish we could be like New York that we had these cameras that flash and get you your license plate because we get so much money for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4149.825s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4151.866s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4152.387s">Yeah,</a>  and I did want to just note enforcement is something <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4157.714s">that</a>  we need more of. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4158.875s">I</a>  mean, it's not a state-controlled road, but I was on Winthrop Street coming down the hill from Tufts six weeks ago, and I'm doing 20, maybe 25, but 20 going down to 15 to go over the raised crosswalk in front of the church. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4170.42s">Guy</a>  whips around me 45 miles an hour, left lane, opposite lane, oncoming traffic, and he's not all the way back into the right lane until Goldilocks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4179.685s">I</a>  mean, and you had people <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4182.082s">trying</a>  to cross at West Street, trying to cross up a little further at Summer Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4185.425s">It</a>  was just awful to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4187.527s">And</a>  I, of course, immediately pulled over on South Street and called the chief because I had the license plate number. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4193.432s">And</a>  he says, we can't do anything but pull the plate, call them, and say, hey, you can't do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4198.055s">But</a>  I can't enforce the law. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4201.178s">So</a>  we need more enforcement. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4205.161s">that,</a>  you know, I used to have some more concerns about the safe traffic cameras that I do now, given how people have been driving. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4212.267s">So</a>  with that, any further discussion on this item or public participation will go to Councilor Tseng.</p>

    <p>[Tseng]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4219.65s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4220.47s">I</a>  just wanted to thank folks for giving us their input about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4225.192s">You</a>  know, these conversations can be contentious in different communities, but I think in Medford here, we really do value safety and we really do value, we see that it's not at conflict with having a good standard of living. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4239.757s">We</a>  know that safety is at the core of having a good standard of living here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4246.536s">You</a>  know, I spend much of my life as a pedestrian. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4249.959s">I</a>  get made fun of a lot for it, but I do love walking around. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4254.163s">That</a>  includes crossing state roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4256.145s">I</a>  think anyone who, and I grew up near, very, a block away from the Felsway. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4261.069s">So</a>  anyone who has very regularly crossed those roads knows the mad dash, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4267.755s">The</a>  sprint that you make to avoid being hit. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4271.838s">It's</a>  really easy to pinpoint one or two anecdotes right here and there by all these different roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4276.901s">I</a>  think it tells us something when we have anecdotes about every single road in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4283.005s">And</a>  I think that's at the core why, for me, I'll be voting yes on this tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4289.268s">And</a>  I think it's just logical to bring our roads all in line with our citywide speed limit as well.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4296.957s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4297.297s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4297.397s">And</a>  I think, you know, there's several processes to be on the lookout for as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4301.361s">Wellington</a>  Circle redesign, the Mystic Avenue, Main Street, Medford Square corridor design process, which is ongoing, and High Street and Mystic Valley Parkway at the Arlington border as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4312.572s">I</a>  know there's designs for shrinking those rotaries. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4316.828s">the</a>  lane width at those rotaries as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4318.509s">And</a>  those are some really major projects that we should all be paying attention to, um, in terms of design and making sure that they're gonna keep us safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4326.452s">So</a>  seeing no further discussion on the motion of Councilors are seconded by Council Vice President Collins as amended by Councilors are all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4338.236s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4338.736s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4340.697s">Last</a>  thing we have on the agenda, public participation. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4343.138s">If</a>  you have public participation on any item that was not otherwise on the agenda, you can come to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4350.139s">And</a>  I will go to Mr. Fiore, name and address for the record. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4353.26s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4354.36s">Thank</a>  you very much, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4357.0s">I</a>  just had a few comments, semi-related to the last item. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4360.761s">So</a>  I didn't want to take the time for specific that agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4364.002s">So</a>  first of all, on South Border Road, there's no crosswalk <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4369.252s">either</a>  on the cross Fells Trail. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4371.674s">So</a>  as you go from Lawrence Estates part of the Fells Reservation to the main part of the reservation, there's a witness an accident there because like, so when hikers kind of go through and the car sort of stops, the cars behind the car, they don't realize, and then they just like rear end. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4389.071s">There's</a>  actually debris right now there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4390.673s">So</a>  if you go like there was an accident, I don't know, not that long ago, probably. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4394.916s">So</a>  if we could do something to at least put a sign, if not a crosswalk to, you know, so cars are a little bit more aware that there might be people crossing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4402.319s">Same</a>  thing on Governor's Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4404.96s">So</a>  when it reaches the falls, a lot of people just cross because there's like a fire road that goes into the falls there and people cross. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4411.303s">There's</a>  no sort of like even a sign that says like, oh, you know, people might be crossing here. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4416.285s">So</a>  that might be something to address. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4419.926s">Yes,</a>  so you mentioned that Medford might be the city after Boston that has the highest proportion of state control roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4427.468s">So</a>  I've been thinking about this. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4429.429s">So</a>  who maintains those roads? <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4431.689s">So</a>  whenever they need, you know, there's potholes or something, they need to be fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4436.971s">Is</a>  that Medford or is that</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4440.239s">That's</a>  a complicated question. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4441.4s">Actually,</a>  there are state routes like Route 60 that are city controlled. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4446.847s">Most</a>  of High Street and Salem Street is city controlled. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4449.971s">So</a>  I believe Medford does repairs on those the state controlled portions of state road state routes or non state routes, the agency. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4460.083s">that</a>  controls them is responsible. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4461.584s">So,</a>  for example, I lived on Fells Way West. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4465.125s">Our</a>  snow shoveling and snow removal, that's DCR region, I can't remember the region number, but it's the region that's up at Spot Pond, the headquarters there. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4474.249s">So</a>  Medford snow shoveling and street sweeping rules don't apply to that section of Fells Way West, nor does maintenance or redesign. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4481.892s">It's</a>  actually also one of the reasons that <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4484.053s">Main</a>  Street and Mystic Ave and Medford Square, that intersection design is so complicated, a portion of the streets are city controlled, a portion of the streets are DCR, and a portion of the streets are MassDOT. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4495.345s">So</a>  you had to get all three of those groups together to approve design. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4500.77s">And</a>  probably when it's done, you'll have different agencies maintaining different parts of that intersection. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4507.116s">That's</a>  my general understanding of how it works. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4509.537s">It's</a>  probably even more specific stuff but for example, if you're going up fells way west towards stone them, or you can turn right onto Elm Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4519.682s">They</a>  put a paint bump out to change the angle of the curve because it was really steep and people were just whipping right up Elm. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4527.244s">but</a>  it was just paint. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4528.585s">I</a>  remember talking with director Blake about putting bollards out to further try to make people actually follow the new curve. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4537.553s">And</a>  DCR said that they wouldn't do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4540.976s">They</a>  didn't have the staff to maintain the bollards and Todd and DPW offered to do it ourselves. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4546.481s">And</a>  they said, we won't let you do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4548.202s">So</a>  there's jurisdictional questions that create some <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4552.614s">really</a>  frustrating issues.</p>

    <p>[Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4554.235s">Yeah,</a>  it would be interesting. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4555.636s">I'm</a>  going to try to get the data because it would be interesting to actually compute, you know, what what in terms of like our total road length, what percentage is actually, you know, we cannot control in terms of maintenance, for example, and then the same issue with private roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4569.347s">So</a>  I live in a private road and then there's a section that is actually in pretty bad shape. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4574.591s">I've</a>  been going through the process of trying to repave it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4576.552s">The</a>  city won't repave it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4577.973s">The</a>  only thing that they do is just patching. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4580.474s">So</a>  I think it would be interesting to have this data. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4582.956s">So</a>  then when the conversation comes about, for example, the DPW budget, then we can compare, well, this is how much we're spending compared to, for example, some of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4590.72s">But</a>  at the same time, we might have less roads that we can actually maintain, for example, private roads or roads around the DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4597.383s">I</a>  just think it would be interesting to just have the data so then we can talk based on facts. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4603.745s">I</a>  think that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4606.496s">Yep.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4607.199s">But</a>  tell what the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4608.953s">There's</a>  accidents all the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4610.354s">And</a>  again, it's not necessarily a car that goes over a pedestrian. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4613.897s">It's</a>  like the first car slows down or breaks and the next cars are just doing something else. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4619.882s">They</a>  don't realize and there's an accident.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4622.024s">Yeah,</a>  cyclists on that street too. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4623.985s">I</a>  mean, I would have a really, I mean, it seems like a great place to go on a bike ride and then you're there.</p>

    <p>[Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4629.65s">I</a>  mentioned the good bike racks. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4631.271s">So</a>  people can actually bike to the falls. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4632.813s">There's</a>  none. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4633.873s">And</a>  now that I think about it, last thing is like, so also people dump trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4637.596s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4638.417s">In</a>  those areas of the files. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4640.479s">So</a>  enforcement, not only related to traffic, but we could put a camera or something to see figure out who is actually dumping trash. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4648.245s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4649.666s">Because</a>  it's just, it's just not nice.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4651.647s">There's</a>  a couple larger conversations DCR at the state level. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4657.423s">It</a>  used to be even more ridiculous how many agencies controlled different parkways and roadways, and they were regionalized. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4663.725s">And</a>  you had the old MDC and different regional district commissions. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4667.126s">And</a>  I won't go into it, but that all got merged into DCR. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4670.427s">But</a>  it still doesn't make a ton of sense to have DCR maintaining all of these roads. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4674.188s">MassDOT</a>  should probably be doing it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4675.349s">It</a>  should be centralized. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4676.569s">DCR</a>  is deeply underfunded. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4679.41s">I</a>  think, yeah, I could go into that forever. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4681.831s">But</a>  that's another piece of the problem with the enforcement on, <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4686.112s">You</a>  know, fells by going up towards stone or south border road. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4690.374s">Snow</a>  shoveling, I mean it was ridiculous you know they won't even put up bollards to because they're like what if someone we don't have the staff capacity to put them back up if they get knocked down, so that was their justification so that that funding issue with DC ours and there's a problem to that needs to get solved. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4704.941s">But</a>  I appreciate the comment. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4706.042s">And</a>  the one other thing is that the Chapter 90 money that we get, which is basically the only money most cities use for street maintenance, is based on just the proportion of the public ways that are in the city control. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4717.469s">So</a>  the state-controlled roads are out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4719.49s">The</a>  private ways are out of it.</p>

    <p>[Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4721.455s">So</a>  that's the money from the state, basically. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4723.316s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4723.616s">And</a>  that formula is also deeply underfunded, but we get an even shorter end of the stick because we have such a smaller proportion of the mileage in the city is actually controlled by the city.</p>

    <p>[Fiore]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4733.04s">Interesting.</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4733.7s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4734.381s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4735.001s">You</a>  got it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4735.541s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4736.742s">Any</a>  further public participation, either in person or on Zoom? <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4742.244s">We</a>  have Steve Schnapp. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4743.465s">Steve,</a>  name and address for the record, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4745.786s">You</a>  have three minutes.</p>

    <p>[Schnapp]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4748.727s">Thank</a>  you, Steve Schnapp, 36 Hillside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4751.729s">in</a>  Medford Square. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4753.429s">I</a>  have a quick question and then a request, or maybe the other way around. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4759.993s">The</a>  request is that when you use acronyms, perhaps at least once, say what they are. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4765.955s">Most</a>  folks know what MassDOT is, not everybody does. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4770.137s">So</a>  it's just helpful when using an acronym to first let folks know what it means. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4779.203s">The</a>  second question I have is I've noticed on the agenda for several meetings that there's a report under reports due and deadlines, a quarterly presentation on the city's financial health by the CFO. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4798.052s">I've</a>  noticed that on the agenda item many times, but I've never heard or haven't heard in those meetings discussion of that, whether the reports come into the city council. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4812.565s">I'm</a>  just curious about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4814.026s">That's</a>  all. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4815.968s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4816.388s">I'll</a>  have to check my email. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4817.849s">We</a>  did receive a report for quarter one. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4822.483s">Yeah,</a>  I think it was within the last two weeks or maybe early November. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4827.306s">It</a>  would be incumbent on a councillor to move that item from unfinished business to take it up from the table for us to discuss it. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4835.651s">So</a>  if councillors want to do that, they're free to do so at any time. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4840.554s">And</a>  we do have a report that we got from the administration on fiscal 25 quarter one finances. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4848.739s">And</a>  I will work on the acronym thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4850.08s">Thanks,</a>  Steve. <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4853.871s">All</a>  right, any further discussion by members of the council? <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4858.4s">On</a>  the motion to adjourn by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4863.391s">Opposed?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/kojaidJyMMQ&t=4863.852s">Motion</a>  passes.</p>
