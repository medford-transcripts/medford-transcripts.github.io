[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.

29
00:06:33,712 --> 00:06:34,772
[SPEAKER_05]: That is really amazing.

30
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:37,134
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much for all of your hard work.

31
00:06:38,194 --> 00:06:41,556
[SPEAKER_05]: I lived with a rower during college and they have to be the fittest athletes.

32
00:06:41,636 --> 00:06:43,217
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe how early you guys must wake up.

33
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:49,221
[SPEAKER_05]: So just our heartiest congratulations on this really major achievement and for doing Medford proud.

34
00:06:49,461 --> 00:06:49,701
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

35
00:06:54,721 --> 00:06:55,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

36
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:59,483
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for my fellow colleagues to add me to this resolution.

37
00:06:59,523 --> 00:07:03,405
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it speaks volumes for me as a school team member.

38
00:07:03,825 --> 00:07:12,949
[SPEAKER_02]: I was part of that group that was first initiated with the thought of, hey, there's a program that we really want to start here in Medford.

39
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:13,669
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called Crew.

40
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:16,891
[SPEAKER_02]: And we didn't have a slip.

41
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:18,551
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have any docks.

42
00:07:18,611 --> 00:07:19,732
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have a boathouse.

43
00:07:19,812 --> 00:07:20,652
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have anything.

44
00:07:21,073 --> 00:07:24,214
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were borrowing skulls from different

45
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:27,136
[SPEAKER_02]: different colleges and they were donating them to us.

46
00:07:27,577 --> 00:07:31,065
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really started so and you know, it's just a fad.

47
00:07:31,967 --> 00:07:34,011
[SPEAKER_02]: What I what you realize is that

48
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,354
[SPEAKER_02]: committed young people really drove this when we first started it to where we are today.

49
00:07:40,874 --> 00:07:53,984
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's so amazing that we have state champions in front of us right now with committed coaches and kids looking to go to the next level, colleges, universities, and participate in crew at that level.

50
00:07:54,004 --> 00:07:56,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just amazing feet and see where we've gone.

51
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:57,787
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what, I'll say it here.

52
00:07:57,827 --> 00:08:01,370
[SPEAKER_02]: I've talked to a bunch of parents that I work in recreation and one of the,

53
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:09,798
[SPEAKER_02]: the most attractive pieces of our puzzle in Somerville is our boathouse.

54
00:08:10,418 --> 00:08:21,128
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we can do, we have summer programs using rowing crew and the different avenues of community that crew really brings to Medford.

55
00:08:21,669 --> 00:08:26,233
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll say it publicly, I would love to see the mayor

56
00:08:27,134 --> 00:08:40,847
[SPEAKER_02]: use our CPA money to look down the line to building us a true boathouse over at home else stadium I think that, to me, would be full circle and look at something that you know we have an avenue, we have a funding mechanism in place.

57
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:44,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Now all we need is a reason for it.

58
00:08:44,384 --> 00:08:46,025
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've given us this reason tenfold.

59
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:48,748
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to congratulate all of you coaches.

60
00:08:49,369 --> 00:08:54,954
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that Mr. Maloney was in the forefront years ago when people told him that this wasn't going to happen.

61
00:08:54,994 --> 00:09:02,041
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe if maybe some people remember, when we first started, they put a couple of rowing machines

62
00:09:02,801 --> 00:09:06,283
[SPEAKER_02]: in what's now the boys locker basketball locker room in the gym.

63
00:09:06,723 --> 00:09:08,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it still there do you guys still use that area.

64
00:09:09,105 --> 00:09:10,245
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like that's all we had.

65
00:09:10,665 --> 00:09:18,890
[SPEAKER_02]: We had four, and people were just taking turns, jumping in so we've gone a long way so I commend all of you for pushing this forward.

66
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:24,393
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's amazing when you listen to other people from different communities, when they talk about

67
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:37,081
[SPEAKER_02]: What Medford crew is doing at the regard is and what they're doing at different events, and how you're seeing sportsmanship and and pride in community and this is what it's all about, you know, in.

68
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:41,390
[SPEAKER_02]: Traditionally, it was what hockey, football, baseball, right?

69
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:56,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you're seeing lifetime sports where you're seeing people using crew to go to the next level in academia, and then taking that to the next level and really promoting something that's really healthy and positive in our community.

70
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,421
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know I'm winded, but I just wanted to

71
00:09:59,961 --> 00:10:08,408
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the vision when this came forth of when this started, when I was on the school committee and seeing where it is today, just amazing.

72
00:10:08,648 --> 00:10:16,875
[SPEAKER_02]: I like so much pride with all the medals on our athletes and coaches standing there stoically and I appreciate all this hard work.

73
00:10:16,915 --> 00:10:19,317
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you and congratulations.

74
00:10:21,099 --> 00:10:22,040
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

75
00:10:30,712 --> 00:10:32,493
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor say, thank you.

76
00:10:32,513 --> 00:10:36,715
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, Councilor Scarpelli spoke to the beginning of the crew program.

77
00:10:37,495 --> 00:10:40,216
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I was there when it was really ramping up really building up.

78
00:10:40,917 --> 00:10:44,498
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and I know that for most of my friends that crew.

79
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:52,812
[SPEAKER_12]: put so many hours into it woke up so early, so many hours after school training and gym outside of practice as well.

80
00:10:53,192 --> 00:10:55,615
[SPEAKER_12]: I know how much work it takes.

81
00:10:56,275 --> 00:10:59,939
[SPEAKER_12]: It's something that I can't I can't do myself so hats off to you all.

82
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:08,405
[SPEAKER_12]: I also know, looking at all my friends and seeing their love for CRU, that CRU is home for so many people.

83
00:11:09,065 --> 00:11:25,895
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm just so happy that a program that so many of our students call home has gotten this really splendid, really, really amazing achievement and recognition of the hard work and the community that you all have built together.

84
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:36,485
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I think as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned, as Vice President Collins mentioned, this is really bringing pride to our city.

85
00:11:37,606 --> 00:11:44,050
[SPEAKER_12]: This is something our city can unite around, can be proud of, and you've made it happen.

86
00:11:44,210 --> 00:11:54,297
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think for that, all of us here on this side of the rail are very, very, very grateful for that hard work that you've put into everything.

87
00:11:56,124 --> 00:12:06,747
[SPEAKER_12]: know, Councilor Scarpelli kind of stole my thunder when he said, you know, you got the sports that, you know, I think a generation ago we would have thought were, you know, the normal listing of sports.

88
00:12:07,307 --> 00:12:19,631
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you got crew, which, you know, is something so, I think, central to life in Medford, especially with the Mystic in the middle, running through the middle of our city, that I think our residents, our students often take for granted.

89
00:12:20,151 --> 00:12:27,100
[SPEAKER_12]: But having gone to college and grad school, you start to realize that not everyone has this opportunity.

90
00:12:27,321 --> 00:12:37,073
[SPEAKER_12]: And for you guys to really make it shine and to really show everyone how worth it it is to have a program like this, I think that's really stellar.

91
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:43,281
[SPEAKER_12]: I have a lot of friends who've gone on to do crew in college and really thrived there.

92
00:12:43,802 --> 00:12:50,544
[SPEAKER_12]: And I hope that you carry that energy with you, even when life gets really busy, to find time to do it, even for fun.

93
00:12:51,144 --> 00:12:57,225
[SPEAKER_12]: It might be for a college sport, but to really keep up with it and keep making all of us proud.

94
00:12:57,585 --> 00:13:02,607
[SPEAKER_12]: I would be really remiss if I didn't thank the coaches for their hard work that they put into this as well.

95
00:13:03,527 --> 00:13:09,970
[SPEAKER_12]: as well as the parents, because I know, you know, I had parents that really were very, very supportive of my extracurriculars.

96
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:18,855
[SPEAKER_12]: I know there's a lot of work put into it, a lot of work making sure that you can afford what you do, making sure that you can get to your practice, making sure that you have everything you need to succeed.

97
00:13:18,895 --> 00:13:25,258
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think oftentimes that kind of, that work from the parent's side has gone underappreciated.

98
00:13:25,278 --> 00:13:26,798
[SPEAKER_12]: So I wanted to thank you all too.

99
00:13:27,499 --> 00:13:27,799
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

100
00:13:36,018 --> 00:13:36,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Councilor Cullohan.

101
00:13:52,232 --> 00:13:53,092
[SPEAKER_15]: mechanical problems.

102
00:13:53,913 --> 00:13:54,613
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for being here.

103
00:13:54,633 --> 00:14:10,581
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a nephew who got into rowing in high school that all through college had changed his life, the sheer amount of time and dedication and, you know, muscles that you got to put in to be, to do rowing and teamwork.

104
00:14:11,382 --> 00:14:14,323
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's an incredible achievement for you to reach the state level.

105
00:14:14,984 --> 00:14:17,185
[SPEAKER_15]: It is an incredible achievement for Medford.

106
00:14:18,265 --> 00:14:19,626
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm just so proud.

107
00:14:19,806 --> 00:14:23,607
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm excited for you to be here and thanks each and every one of you for all the work that you do.

108
00:14:25,607 --> 00:14:28,768
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

109
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:32,729
[SPEAKER_13]: A long, long time ago, I was on the crew team for a season.

110
00:14:33,410 --> 00:14:37,111
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli was like a freshman on the school committee at the time.

111
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:41,412
[SPEAKER_13]: But I was much better on the ERG machine than I was on the water.

112
00:14:41,692 --> 00:14:42,752
[SPEAKER_13]: I caught a lot of crabs.

113
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:48,958
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah, I mean, it's just amazing to see how far the program has come.

114
00:14:49,078 --> 00:14:55,360
[SPEAKER_13]: We were on the Malden River running out of that gentle giant tent and it was really new at the time.

115
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,761
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just really great to see what you've accomplished.

116
00:14:58,781 --> 00:15:00,502
[SPEAKER_13]: So thank you so much for being here.

117
00:15:00,582 --> 00:15:04,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Parents, students, coaches, we're really, really excited to celebrate you.

118
00:15:04,563 --> 00:15:06,984
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know this is your second night in this room in a row.

119
00:15:07,344 --> 00:15:08,764
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll get you out of here real soon.

120
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:10,605
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much for being here.

121
00:15:15,868 --> 00:15:26,535
[SPEAKER_13]: Open it up, if anyone from the team wants to say anything, you're welcome to come to the podium and say something if you want, share your story.

122
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:32,359
[SPEAKER_11]: He's got the trophy.

123
00:15:32,705 --> 00:15:34,466
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, I'm Scott Campbell.

124
00:15:34,706 --> 00:15:38,268
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm a senior at Medford High School and a captain of the Medford rowing team.

125
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:45,872
[SPEAKER_11]: When I first came on the team freshman year, I would have been shocked if you told me that we would have been getting a trophy like this.

126
00:15:45,972 --> 00:15:48,893
[SPEAKER_11]: We've come a really long way, very quickly.

127
00:15:49,493 --> 00:15:53,315
[SPEAKER_11]: And I would really like to thank the coaches, thank the captains, and thank the support from the city.

128
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:59,078
[SPEAKER_11]: If any of you council members want to come out and do some rowing, let us know and we'll be able to get that arranged.

129
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,159
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, thank you.

130
00:16:01,219 --> 00:16:02,000
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you so much.

131
00:16:07,674 --> 00:16:11,715
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, if there's no further discussion, we'd love to take a photo with you.

132
00:16:12,256 --> 00:16:15,857
[SPEAKER_13]: Feel free to come up and fill in the center of the chamber here.

133
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:22,039
[SPEAKER_13]: If you can make it around, we've got a lot of stuff in here.

134
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:55,270
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion on the floor?

135
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:57,451
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Collins.

136
00:19:01,433 --> 00:19:03,535
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to take resolutions under suspension.

137
00:19:04,335 --> 00:19:05,236
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to approve this first.

138
00:19:05,556 --> 00:19:06,517
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, motion to approve.

139
00:19:06,537 --> 00:19:13,401
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion to approve the resolution by Council, Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

140
00:19:14,662 --> 00:19:15,322
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

141
00:19:15,762 --> 00:19:15,902
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

142
00:19:16,062 --> 00:19:16,423
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

143
00:19:16,503 --> 00:19:17,323
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

144
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:18,984
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Collins.

145
00:19:19,725 --> 00:19:21,486
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to take resolutions under suspension.

146
00:19:22,134 --> 00:19:28,638
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion to take resolutions under suspension by Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan.

147
00:19:29,499 --> 00:19:30,200
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

148
00:19:31,941 --> 00:19:32,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

149
00:19:33,202 --> 00:19:34,122
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

150
00:19:34,142 --> 00:19:37,004
[SPEAKER_13]: So you have three resolutions under suspension tonight.

151
00:19:39,025 --> 00:19:44,189
[SPEAKER_13]: Resolution one offered by the president, vice president,

152
00:19:44,793 --> 00:19:56,138
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved by the city council that we congratulate the Medford Mustang football team on beating Malden in the Thanksgiving game and winning the first GBL championship for the city since 1985.

153
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:00,840
[SPEAKER_13]: Any discussion on that item?

154
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:06,082
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, Councilor Lazzaro.

155
00:20:12,093 --> 00:20:18,494
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, that was a very fun Thanksgiving game in the rain, and it was cold, and it was amazing.

156
00:20:18,534 --> 00:20:20,355
[SPEAKER_08]: They played, the team played so, so well.

157
00:20:20,395 --> 00:20:21,495
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really exciting.

158
00:20:23,315 --> 00:20:30,596
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm so happy to celebrate the team and gladly support that resolution.

159
00:20:30,776 --> 00:20:31,997
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for putting it forward.

160
00:20:32,017 --> 00:20:34,097
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

161
00:20:34,197 --> 00:20:35,477
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Tseng.

162
00:20:38,578 --> 00:20:38,978
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

163
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:43,298
[SPEAKER_12]: A number of us from this council went together.

164
00:20:44,899 --> 00:20:50,660
[SPEAKER_12]: It was a great day, a great way to spend a rainy Thanksgiving.

165
00:20:52,341 --> 00:21:08,426
[SPEAKER_12]: It's always really exciting to see your home team do well, especially as someone who, you know, I've been involved in Medford High School, the Medford High School scene for such a long time that I can remember, you know,

166
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:10,457
[SPEAKER_12]: more difficult times.

167
00:21:15,979 --> 00:21:32,728
[SPEAKER_12]: But you know what, I think this really exemplifies how much work we, the coaches have put into this program, how much work our teachers and the school, public schools have put into our sports here in Medford, that Medford sports is now on the rise.

168
00:21:33,688 --> 00:21:38,531
[SPEAKER_12]: One of the most exciting moments of Thanksgiving week was seeing a touchdown happen right in front of us.

169
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:42,027
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's something, you know, we can really hoot and holler about.

170
00:21:42,407 --> 00:21:55,358
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm really pumped for the football team, really pumped for what Medford Sports has in store for the seasons to come, and really grateful, again, for the hard work of the parents, the students, the coaches as well.

171
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,442
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna go to Councilor Callahan, then Councilor Scarpelli.

172
00:22:01,101 --> 00:22:02,102
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks so much.

173
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:07,026
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, it was an excellent time to see a game on Thanksgiving day.

174
00:22:07,066 --> 00:22:08,047
[SPEAKER_15]: It was fantastic.

175
00:22:08,107 --> 00:22:09,328
[SPEAKER_15]: Really great to see some touchdowns.

176
00:22:10,268 --> 00:22:22,318
[SPEAKER_15]: I will say as a total band geek that I was sad that I missed the marching band, but it was okay to see a wonderful winning game and an excellent game of football.

177
00:22:22,338 --> 00:22:22,838
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you so much.

178
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,761
[SPEAKER_13]: And our next resolution is about the marching band.

179
00:22:25,821 --> 00:22:26,902
[SPEAKER_13]: So we'll get to talk about them too.

180
00:22:27,502 --> 00:22:28,443
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli.

181
00:22:29,042 --> 00:22:29,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

182
00:22:30,043 --> 00:22:36,686
[SPEAKER_02]: It truly was the victory, the first time greater Boston League champion since the early 90s.

183
00:22:38,047 --> 00:22:43,650
[SPEAKER_02]: First time announced tonight, first time we've had a greater Boston League MVP and Justin Marino.

184
00:22:45,291 --> 00:22:53,355
[SPEAKER_02]: So many kids now coach Curley and his coaching staff ascending off to play at the next level that you have, and you're talking about

185
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:58,543
[SPEAKER_02]: a group of kids that without football wouldn't have an opportunity to get to the next level.

186
00:22:58,923 --> 00:22:59,763
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's amazing.

187
00:23:01,103 --> 00:23:08,165
[SPEAKER_02]: What I really want to stress is how impressed I am with the football program for what they do for the community.

188
00:23:09,085 --> 00:23:13,826
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see the wins and Thanksgiving, that's great, touchdowns, and everybody's happy about that.

189
00:23:14,246 --> 00:23:22,188
[SPEAKER_02]: What I find more amazing is what they did the week before when they went to the shelter and they

190
00:23:22,990 --> 00:23:31,201
[SPEAKER_02]: They prepared a couple of the, what am I thinking, Zach?

191
00:23:31,241 --> 00:23:39,893
[SPEAKER_02]: The food, it wasn't the meals, they were doing the different community centers.

192
00:23:40,973 --> 00:23:44,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so they really, the pantry, excuse me, thank you for helping me with that.

193
00:23:44,974 --> 00:23:53,577
[SPEAKER_02]: But they were setting up the food pantries and helping with stock and share and present that to the community members.

194
00:23:53,837 --> 00:23:59,659
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see them this winter, delivering, shoveling seniors out.

195
00:24:00,059 --> 00:24:06,701
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you're seeing right now is a true champion in the sense that, forget about the wins and losses.

196
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:20,839
[SPEAKER_02]: Coach for 32 years, you seldom remember those truly what they're going to remember is what they did as a team and as a family as being part of a community and really giving back to the community so I congratulate coach curly.

197
00:24:23,221 --> 00:24:25,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris Murphy, who's the President of the Mustang.

198
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:31,151
[SPEAKER_02]: football program and what they do for our community and give them back.

199
00:24:31,672 --> 00:24:43,259
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would love to invite them to our next meeting, if we can, Mr. President, to them and our next guests and the band and really celebrate what they've done, both on the field and off.

200
00:24:43,299 --> 00:24:44,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's equally important.

201
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,140
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

202
00:24:45,981 --> 00:24:47,061
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

203
00:24:47,081 --> 00:24:52,165
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and I was hoping we'll reach out, we'll figure out if it's next meeting or maybe in January,

204
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:56,772
[SPEAKER_13]: which which one we can get people here for but I also just wanted to.

205
00:24:58,837 --> 00:25:14,226
[SPEAKER_13]: really appreciate what the program means year round for students and keeping them engaged in the community and involved, not just in football activities, but community activities, community service, and academic success.

206
00:25:14,426 --> 00:25:22,931
[SPEAKER_13]: It really is something that not just the football program, the crew team, the band, every program that we have in our city,

207
00:25:24,452 --> 00:25:35,244
[SPEAKER_13]: gives a young person an opportunity to be more involved in their community, or maybe helps make sure they stay involved in their community and stay on track and I think that that is really the great benefit of the vibrant.

208
00:25:37,532 --> 00:25:40,393
[SPEAKER_13]: activities that we have arts, sports, music, all of it.

209
00:25:41,494 --> 00:25:51,617
[SPEAKER_13]: And also, I do want to ask Coach Curley, how he's going to replace the GBL MVP and I think now all time Mustang football scoring leader and Justin Marino, it's pretty impressive.

210
00:25:51,757 --> 00:25:55,179
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, we can have a little sports fun too.

211
00:25:56,459 --> 00:25:57,900
[SPEAKER_13]: It's got a brother in the fifth grade.

212
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,580
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a lot of pressure.

213
00:26:02,287 --> 00:26:02,727
[SPEAKER_13]: But yeah.

214
00:26:06,309 --> 00:26:06,689
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

215
00:26:07,509 --> 00:26:16,973
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion on this motion as amended by Councilor Scarpelli to invite representatives from the team or the full team if they can all make it to a future meeting?

216
00:26:18,854 --> 00:26:23,296
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none on the motion of Councilor Collins to approve as amended seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favor?

217
00:26:23,956 --> 00:26:24,376
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

218
00:26:24,456 --> 00:26:25,217
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

219
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:33,463
[SPEAKER_13]: second resolution under suspension, be it resolved that we celebrate and congratulate our Medford Mustang marching band on their NESBA championship.

220
00:26:34,663 --> 00:26:37,284
[SPEAKER_13]: And we'll say that that's from Councilor Lazzaro Callahan.

221
00:26:39,025 --> 00:26:47,468
[SPEAKER_13]: And just wanted to introduce that our marching band also has seen, I was in the marching band and I sat through I think four consecutive

222
00:26:48,052 --> 00:26:54,937
[SPEAKER_13]: four or five, I think it might've been there even longer than that, consecutive Thanksgiving losses, but it was still awesome.

223
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:57,259
[SPEAKER_13]: The program was still doing community work.

224
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:08,488
[SPEAKER_13]: Cheer Squad was doing great and we were doing well, but it was at a time, Councilor Scarpelli knows we've talked about it, of cuts where we lost our marching director.

225
00:27:08,528 --> 00:27:10,089
[SPEAKER_13]: We had one person doing the band.

226
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:13,832
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've seen this really vibrant resurgence over the last 10 years.

227
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:27,602
[SPEAKER_13]: For better, I mean, thankfully from, but from the parents and from private fundraising to support the band as someone who thinks that it would be great to have the public funds back in those programs that that.

228
00:27:28,331 --> 00:27:34,476
[SPEAKER_13]: All that extra work doesn't go unnoticed, even though I don't think that needs to happen and I think it can be helpful.

229
00:27:35,216 --> 00:27:43,182
[SPEAKER_13]: I'd love to see more support but our band has really seen that resurgence to in recent years winning multiple NSBA championships.

230
00:27:43,502 --> 00:27:47,405
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, my senior year we didn't have we didn't march.

231
00:27:48,188 --> 00:28:04,464
[SPEAKER_13]: You know that that's how bad it had gotten we had a field show but we stood in place and we performed it or we performed it from the stands and now you have a color guard, and you have percussion and you have electronically amplified instruments and all these things and new uniforms, all of these things that we didn't have.

232
00:28:07,307 --> 00:28:12,409
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and they're doing the tree and wreath sale to support the Medford Mustang Marching Band as well.

233
00:28:12,529 --> 00:28:18,690
[SPEAKER_13]: So thanks to everyone for letting me go on first on this one, but it is a real passion of mine.

234
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:24,272
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to celebrate them too and hope that someone will amend to invite them as well.

235
00:28:24,412 --> 00:28:26,173
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to go to Councilor Tseng and then Councilor Lazzaro.

236
00:28:28,273 --> 00:28:28,553
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

237
00:28:28,593 --> 00:28:31,434
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd be happy to make that amendment.

238
00:28:31,974 --> 00:28:34,515
[SPEAKER_12]: I think my fellow councilors know how I was

239
00:28:35,069 --> 00:28:42,815
[SPEAKER_12]: I was involved a lot more with the art scene growing up and seeing the marching band through its many iterations, I think.

240
00:28:43,936 --> 00:28:48,079
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember the marching band as President Bears described it.

241
00:28:48,239 --> 00:28:58,908
[SPEAKER_12]: I remember the marching band as it was growing as well with a new band director, with new uniforms, equipment, things really, really ramping up.

242
00:28:59,288 --> 00:28:59,788
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we're

243
00:29:00,856 --> 00:29:09,062
[SPEAKER_12]: the recent successes of the marching band, the year after year successes of the marching band really show, I mean, one thing, right?

244
00:29:09,102 --> 00:29:10,563
[SPEAKER_12]: Like pride to the city.

245
00:29:10,643 --> 00:29:18,208
[SPEAKER_12]: Another thing is the result of community investment into the arts, into building a community for our students where they can really thrive.

246
00:29:18,228 --> 00:29:28,816
[SPEAKER_12]: And the third thing that comes to mind for me especially is just the importance of building a home for our students to have their energies

247
00:29:29,189 --> 00:29:36,006
[SPEAKER_12]: their creative energies their expressive energies channeled into a place where they can feel safe and we're.

248
00:29:37,589 --> 00:29:45,434
[SPEAKER_12]: where when you do that, when you do that, you not only help that child succeed, but you help our city succeed as well.

249
00:29:46,174 --> 00:29:54,540
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I'm really, really grateful for the teachers, for the band directors, for all the parents who make this happen.

250
00:29:54,900 --> 00:30:02,484
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, again, I've seen it from the other side, from the student side, and I know how much work there is there that goes unsaid.

251
00:30:02,665 --> 00:30:05,526
[SPEAKER_12]: I've talked to the teachers after rehearsals are done.

252
00:30:07,108 --> 00:30:11,930
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, it's, they're tired, but they're, they're right on their next lesson plan.

253
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:24,617
[SPEAKER_12]: I, I've talked to, I have a lot of friends who are in bands, especially as well, and they're the reason why President Bears and Councilor Scarpelli can, can sing the fight song right on the spot.

254
00:30:26,478 --> 00:30:27,258
[SPEAKER_12]: As they have before.

255
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:32,381
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll share, I'll share, I'll share with everybody.

256
00:30:34,302 --> 00:30:34,522
[SPEAKER_12]: But,

257
00:30:37,639 --> 00:30:54,864
[SPEAKER_12]: But you know, it goes to show that investments, the investments that we make as a community in our schools, especially in our extracurriculars, which so often fall by the wayside, are so, so important in building a stronger and more thriving community.

258
00:30:54,884 --> 00:30:57,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Tseng.

259
00:30:57,584 --> 00:30:59,205
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna go to Councilor Lazzaro.

260
00:31:00,389 --> 00:31:00,950
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

261
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:08,434
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you can tell how much the City Council relishes an opportunity to talk about our schools.

262
00:31:08,474 --> 00:31:13,897
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't get that many chances, but it's exciting when we have something to celebrate like this.

263
00:31:13,977 --> 00:31:26,484
[SPEAKER_08]: But I do really agree and want to reiterate how important it is for students in our public schools to have opportunities to try different things, find the thing that

264
00:31:26,944 --> 00:31:46,614
[SPEAKER_08]: they fit in with and that they can thrive in, whatever that thing is, if it's sports, if it's music, if it's art, if it's some seemingly random or counterintuitive activity that makes them really happy and makes them feel like they have a place, that's what makes kids thrive.

265
00:31:46,674 --> 00:31:53,457
[SPEAKER_08]: So the importance of these kinds of successes for our students can't be overstated.

266
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,078
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm just very excited about

267
00:31:55,959 --> 00:31:58,926
[SPEAKER_08]: these resolutions coming forward and these celebrations.

268
00:31:59,026 --> 00:31:59,627
[SPEAKER_08]: So thanks.

269
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:01,231
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

270
00:32:01,271 --> 00:32:02,434
[SPEAKER_13]: Go to Councilor Callahan.

271
00:32:05,339 --> 00:32:05,719
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

272
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:09,381
[SPEAKER_15]: As previously stated, I am a band geek.

273
00:32:09,501 --> 00:32:12,102
[SPEAKER_15]: I did marching band all through high school and college.

274
00:32:13,182 --> 00:32:18,064
[SPEAKER_15]: I love the way that the marching band supports the football team and the sports.

275
00:32:19,424 --> 00:32:21,165
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, all of the work that people put in.

276
00:32:21,285 --> 00:32:26,147
[SPEAKER_15]: I really appreciate what Councilor Lazzaro said about kids being able to find

277
00:32:26,747 --> 00:32:31,891
[SPEAKER_15]: an activity and a community in which they feel they can really be themselves and express themselves.

278
00:32:32,871 --> 00:32:39,096
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm so happy that we have not just a marching band, but an amazing marching band that is, you know, really striving and pushing itself.

279
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:42,478
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm really excited and I congratulate them.

280
00:32:43,238 --> 00:32:45,580
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm super proud of what they bring to our community.

281
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:45,860
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks.

282
00:32:47,261 --> 00:32:48,302
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

283
00:32:49,022 --> 00:32:54,166
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do just want to note part of question eight was about

284
00:32:55,207 --> 00:33:14,758
[SPEAKER_13]: trying to expand access to these programs, especially for kids who are taking the vocational programs, supporting coaches and trying to get their salaries up as part of negotiations and investing in not just the core academics, but the access to programs like our football team and our marching band and our crew team and others.

285
00:33:15,239 --> 00:33:23,603
[SPEAKER_13]: And that is a priority, you know, I think we've all talked about just what Councilor Lazzaro said reminded me, it's important to invest in all of that.

286
00:33:25,194 --> 00:33:31,476
[SPEAKER_13]: That's something that we're going to be, well, the school committee is going to be doing over the next several months as they work on their budget.

287
00:33:32,796 --> 00:33:34,337
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion on this item?

288
00:33:36,757 --> 00:33:48,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none on the motion to approve by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Callahan on the paper as amended by Councilor Tseng to invite our marching band to a future meeting.

289
00:33:49,021 --> 00:33:49,661
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

290
00:33:50,381 --> 00:33:50,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Aye.

291
00:33:50,461 --> 00:33:50,922
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

292
00:33:51,442 --> 00:33:52,282
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

293
00:33:54,016 --> 00:34:00,099
[SPEAKER_13]: On the third paper under suspension, we did receive from the mayor a donation acceptance.

294
00:34:00,579 --> 00:34:19,029
[SPEAKER_13]: Dear President Bears and members of the city council, I respectfully request and recommend that your honorable body approves under general law, chapter 44, section 53A, a donation by Andrew P. Castagnetti of $100 and zero cents to be used to install lights on the Mystic River footbridge in memory of Lawrence Larry Lepore, our dearly departed city messenger.

295
00:34:19,749 --> 00:34:21,430
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there any further discussion on that item?

296
00:34:22,364 --> 00:34:26,887
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion to approve by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Council Vice President Collins.

297
00:34:27,588 --> 00:34:28,308
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

298
00:34:29,189 --> 00:34:29,629
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

299
00:34:29,749 --> 00:34:30,630
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

300
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:33,472
[SPEAKER_13]: Records.

301
00:34:33,512 --> 00:34:37,434
[SPEAKER_13]: The records of the meeting of November 12th, 2024 were passed to Vice President Collins.

302
00:34:37,474 --> 00:34:39,196
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Collins, how did you find those records?

303
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:44,599
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, sorry.

304
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:47,982
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Collins found them in order and moves for approval.

305
00:34:48,162 --> 00:34:51,384
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Collins, seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favor?

306
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:52,823
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

307
00:34:52,923 --> 00:34:53,724
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

308
00:34:54,964 --> 00:35:00,106
[SPEAKER_13]: On the records of the meeting of November 19th, 2024, passed to Councilor Lazzaro.

309
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:01,647
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lazzaro, how did you find those records?

310
00:35:01,927 --> 00:35:03,908
[SPEAKER_08]: I found the records in order and I move to approve.

311
00:35:04,788 --> 00:35:07,509
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Lazzaro to approve, seconded by.

312
00:35:07,909 --> 00:35:09,110
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

313
00:35:09,130 --> 00:35:09,810
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

314
00:35:10,551 --> 00:35:11,011
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

315
00:35:11,091 --> 00:35:11,871
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

316
00:35:11,891 --> 00:35:18,574
[SPEAKER_13]: 19-070 offered by Council President Bears, Committee of the Whole report, November 20th, 2024, report to follow.

317
00:35:21,576 --> 00:35:24,437
[SPEAKER_13]: This was, we took back up the tree ordinances.

318
00:35:24,517 --> 00:35:31,159
[SPEAKER_13]: There are three parts of that ordinance, a tree committee ordinance, a public tree ordinance, and a private tree ordinance.

319
00:35:32,539 --> 00:35:44,143
[SPEAKER_13]: Tree committee and public tree ordinance are going to, there's going to be a meeting with city staff and advocates and some members of the council to discuss further that ordinance.

320
00:35:44,823 --> 00:35:49,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Private tree ordinance is being reviewed by the zoning team since it's a zoning ordinance.

321
00:35:49,684 --> 00:35:51,185
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's probably going to either

322
00:35:52,011 --> 00:35:57,713
[SPEAKER_13]: get incorporated into our zoning updates project or at least be aligned with that project.

323
00:35:58,173 --> 00:35:59,573
[SPEAKER_13]: Any discussion on the report.

324
00:36:01,014 --> 00:36:01,954
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Scarpelli.

325
00:36:01,974 --> 00:36:08,936
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some phone calls after and I think that the biggest concern was the private process of tree removal.

326
00:36:10,437 --> 00:36:11,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Residents were really concerned with

327
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:15,872
[SPEAKER_02]: their freedoms and what they have control on their properties.

328
00:36:15,912 --> 00:36:21,256
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that at the time KP law did say that that could be viewed as taking.

329
00:36:21,836 --> 00:36:24,098
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know that that's something that will be reviewed.

330
00:36:24,138 --> 00:36:32,304
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that as people ask me, this is the process, it's gonna be vetted through the process and we'll get a clearer understanding as we move forward.

331
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:33,826
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for that, Mr. President.

332
00:36:33,926 --> 00:36:35,007
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, councilor Scarpelli.

333
00:36:35,027 --> 00:36:37,168
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a motion to approve the committee report?

334
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:40,631
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion of Councilor Tseng to approve the committee report, seconded by?

335
00:36:41,425 --> 00:36:42,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Callahan.

336
00:36:42,846 --> 00:36:43,747
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

337
00:36:44,568 --> 00:36:45,108
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

338
00:36:45,248 --> 00:36:46,069
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

339
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,711
[SPEAKER_13]: Refer to committee for further discussion.

340
00:36:48,731 --> 00:36:52,174
[SPEAKER_13]: 24-502 offered by Vice President Collins.

341
00:36:52,214 --> 00:36:59,500
[SPEAKER_13]: Be it resolved that the Public Health and Community Safety Committee meet to discuss technical amendments to the Community Control over Public Surveillance Ordinance.

342
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Collins.

343
00:37:02,462 --> 00:37:03,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Bears.

344
00:37:03,844 --> 00:37:04,684
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm motioning.

345
00:37:05,225 --> 00:37:05,605
[SPEAKER_05]: Motioning.

346
00:37:06,486 --> 00:37:06,886
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that right?

347
00:37:06,946 --> 00:37:07,246
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving.

348
00:37:07,487 --> 00:37:07,827
[SPEAKER_05]: Moving.

349
00:37:08,217 --> 00:37:09,498
[SPEAKER_05]: God, I knew that didn't sound right.

350
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:10,959
[SPEAKER_05]: Geez.

351
00:37:12,221 --> 00:37:24,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, I am moving to send the existing Community Control of Public Surveillance Ordinance, which was passed last term, to the Public Health and Community Safety Committee.

352
00:37:24,791 --> 00:37:27,394
[SPEAKER_05]: This ordinance was crafted and collaborated on

353
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:52,843
[SPEAKER_05]: in the previous term because the city, the council, and residents had a shared concern and a shared interest in the civil liberties of residents, transparency in our governmental decisions, and a shared interest in making sure that our very precious city dollars are spent on true public safety and not on expensive gadgets and softwares that enrich corporations more than they actually help communities and residents.

354
00:37:53,663 --> 00:38:03,371
[SPEAKER_05]: So to that end, some residents have identified potential changes that we could make to this rather new ordinance that would make it even stronger and even more in line with those shared goals.

355
00:38:04,072 --> 00:38:15,000
[SPEAKER_05]: So I look forward to reviewing those comments, perhaps making some tweaks and having this discussion in committee where we can really get into the details and make this even stronger than it already is.

356
00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:16,001
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

357
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:24,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you on the motion to refer this paper 24502 for discussion by Vice President Collins, seconded by Councilor Lazzaro.

358
00:38:24,355 --> 00:38:25,395
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there any further discussion?

359
00:38:27,596 --> 00:38:29,357
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none, is there any discussion by members of the public?

360
00:38:31,778 --> 00:38:33,398
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none, all those in favor?

361
00:38:33,418 --> 00:38:34,178
[SPEAKER_05]: Aye.

362
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:34,999
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

363
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:35,879
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

364
00:38:36,859 --> 00:38:43,182
[SPEAKER_13]: Hearings 24-490 offered by the City Council public hearing proposed amendments to the Medford zoning ordinance chapter 94.

365
00:38:44,517 --> 00:38:46,877
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm now declaring the public hearing open.

366
00:38:47,818 --> 00:38:51,318
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a hearing notice regarding the Mystic Avenue Corridor District.

367
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:56,039
[SPEAKER_13]: We have not received the recommendations of the Community Development Board yet.

368
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:04,681
[SPEAKER_13]: So general practice is that we would continue this public hearing to a date certain our next regular meeting of December 17th.

369
00:39:05,621 --> 00:39:13,523
[SPEAKER_13]: And at that point, we can review the recommendations of the Community Development Board regarding the Mystic Avenue Corridor District.

370
00:39:14,445 --> 00:39:18,907
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there any discussion?

371
00:39:18,987 --> 00:39:22,789
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none, is there anyone who'd like to speak in the public hearing right now?

372
00:39:25,991 --> 00:39:27,091
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none, is there a motion?

373
00:39:27,712 --> 00:39:28,952
[SPEAKER_13]: Vice President Collins.

374
00:39:30,513 --> 00:39:32,954
[SPEAKER_05]: To continue the public hearing to our next regular meeting.

375
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:38,197
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion to continue the public hearing to the date certain, December 17th regular meeting.

376
00:39:38,217 --> 00:39:40,498
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the right date, right?

377
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:42,499
[SPEAKER_13]: That is, yes.

378
00:39:44,462 --> 00:39:45,602
[SPEAKER_13]: That will need a roll call vote.

379
00:39:46,022 --> 00:39:50,123
[SPEAKER_13]: So on the motion of vice-president Collins, seconded by, seconded by councilor Tseng.

380
00:39:50,523 --> 00:39:51,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

381
00:39:53,764 --> 00:39:54,404

382
00:39:56,244 --> 00:39:57,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice-president Collins.

383
00:39:57,904 --> 00:39:58,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Lazzaro.

384
00:39:59,745 --> 00:40:00,705
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Leming is absent.

385
00:40:01,585 --> 00:40:02,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Scarpelli.

386
00:40:03,745 --> 00:40:04,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Tseng.

387
00:40:04,946 --> 00:40:05,466
[SPEAKER_03]: President Paris.

388
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:07,106
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, six present, one absent.

389
00:40:07,526 --> 00:40:11,967
[SPEAKER_13]: The motion passes and the public hearing has continued to our December 17th regular meeting.

390
00:40:13,592 --> 00:40:17,695
[SPEAKER_13]: petitions, presentations, and similar papers.

391
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:21,558
[SPEAKER_13]: 24-504, petition for a common victualer's license, Medford Donuts Cafe, Inc.

392
00:40:22,478 --> 00:40:33,786
[SPEAKER_13]: We have here on record business certificate, petition, fire department sign-off, building department sign-off, health department treasurer, state tax number, workers' compensation form, letter of compliance, and traffic impact.

393
00:40:33,946 --> 00:40:36,208
[SPEAKER_13]: And I will turn this over to Councilor Scarpelli.

394
00:40:36,688 --> 00:40:38,489
[SPEAKER_13]: We do have the petitioner on Zoom.

395
00:40:43,439 --> 00:40:44,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. President.

396
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,520
[SPEAKER_02]: I see, is Mr. Silva here?

397
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:48,280
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

398
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

399
00:40:49,801 --> 00:40:51,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

400
00:40:51,681 --> 00:41:00,723
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe this is just a carry over from the previous owner who his family had owned it.

401
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:09,685
[SPEAKER_02]: The Calais family owned the donut shop for many, many years, a fixture in the Mefford community.

402
00:41:10,446 --> 00:41:12,226
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm so happy that

403
00:41:13,113 --> 00:41:24,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Silva stepped up and kept this location alive because it is something that I remember when I was a kid.

404
00:41:25,541 --> 00:41:32,425
[SPEAKER_02]: After church, dad would go over to Demet's and pick up the healthy donuts.

405
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:34,146
[SPEAKER_02]: They weren't the bad ones at the time.

406
00:41:35,647 --> 00:41:39,149
[SPEAKER_02]: But I appreciate the information.

407
00:41:39,169 --> 00:41:41,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Looks like everything, Mr. President, is in order.

408
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:58,624
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can, I think the only questions we have is, you know, the number of employees, the hours are staying the same, and that would be it on my end, but I don't see anything that would prohibit us to move this forward after my colleagues share any thoughts, so.

409
00:41:59,124 --> 00:42:00,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

410
00:42:00,105 --> 00:42:02,345
[SPEAKER_13]: I am attempting to unmute the petitioner.

411
00:42:02,865 --> 00:42:08,187
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Silva, I'm gonna click a button and then something should pop up on your screen that'll allow you to speak.

412
00:42:31,328 --> 00:42:33,829
[SPEAKER_13]: I can see you, but I can't unmute you.

413
00:42:33,849 --> 00:42:36,030
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to unmute yourself when I ask.

414
00:42:46,955 --> 00:42:48,816
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you seeing a pop-up on your screen?

415
00:42:48,896 --> 00:42:52,898
[SPEAKER_13]: If you could give me a thumbs up or down if you see it when I press this button.

416
00:42:56,259 --> 00:43:00,301
[SPEAKER_13]: So if you click the unmute button on that pop-up, that should allow you to speak.

417
00:43:16,243 --> 00:43:22,706
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we just, honestly, if we have any other questions, this is a pretty straightforward petition.

418
00:43:23,126 --> 00:43:24,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is in order, Mr. President.

419
00:43:24,967 --> 00:43:25,808
[SPEAKER_02]: I would move approval.

420
00:43:26,128 --> 00:43:35,732
[SPEAKER_02]: If Mr. Silva can add anything, maybe reach out to the clerk for a next meeting, but I don't want to hold this up any longer if it's something that's just technical.

421
00:43:37,033 --> 00:43:38,894
[SPEAKER_13]: Do the councilors have any other questions on this item?

422
00:43:43,396 --> 00:43:44,337
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lazzaro.

423
00:43:46,573 --> 00:43:54,695
[SPEAKER_08]: I would just have some basic questions about if there are any changes planned to the building or the establishment, or if it's just a change of ownership.

424
00:43:55,675 --> 00:43:56,455
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a change of ownership.

425
00:43:56,475 --> 00:43:57,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Seems like just a change of ownership.

426
00:43:57,556 --> 00:43:58,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just a change of ownership.

427
00:43:59,376 --> 00:43:59,576
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

428
00:44:00,376 --> 00:44:00,536
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

429
00:44:01,797 --> 00:44:07,858
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Scarpelli to approve, and we can send any questions through the clerk to the petitioner if needed.

430
00:44:10,519 --> 00:44:11,419
[SPEAKER_13]: Is there a second on the motion?

431
00:44:12,959 --> 00:44:14,039
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Tseng.

432
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:15,860
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion by members of the Council?

433
00:44:17,290 --> 00:44:19,951
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none, is there any discussion by members of the public on this item?

434
00:44:28,496 --> 00:44:28,976
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh boy.

435
00:44:30,837 --> 00:44:35,599
[SPEAKER_13]: Folks don't know City Hall was closed to most of today, at least till noon, because the heat was not working.

436
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:39,741
[SPEAKER_13]: So another building that needs some TLC for sure.

437
00:44:39,761 --> 00:44:42,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Should ask for an override.

438
00:44:49,792 --> 00:44:51,753
[SPEAKER_13]: Maybe a dead exclusion.

439
00:44:52,333 --> 00:44:58,455
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion, all in favor, or do you want a roll call?

440
00:44:59,896 --> 00:45:00,356
[SPEAKER_13]: We don't have to?

441
00:45:00,376 --> 00:45:01,477
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, all those in favor?

442
00:45:02,257 --> 00:45:02,977
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

443
00:45:03,037 --> 00:45:05,858
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes and the common fixture license is approved.

444
00:45:05,918 --> 00:45:06,278
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

445
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,099
[SPEAKER_13]: Sorry, we couldn't hear from you.

446
00:45:12,375 --> 00:45:15,897
[SPEAKER_13]: 24505 petition for a common victor's license for Bunn's House.

447
00:45:16,197 --> 00:45:29,302
[SPEAKER_13]: We have the petition here, business certificate fee, approval from fire department, building department, health department, treasurer, state tax ID, worker's compensation form, a letter of compliance and police and traffic.

448
00:45:29,742 --> 00:45:37,465
[SPEAKER_13]: And it looks like we also have counsel for the applicant, Mr. Chin on Zoom perhaps, or I saw you come on video.

449
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:43,016
[SPEAKER_13]: I can ask you to unmute if there's anything you'd like to add, and then I'll go to Councilor Scarpelli.

450
00:45:50,309 --> 00:45:51,030
[SPEAKER_13]: Hello, Councilor.

451
00:45:51,591 --> 00:45:52,152
[SPEAKER_13]: How are you?

452
00:45:53,733 --> 00:45:54,434
[SPEAKER_16]: Good evening again.

453
00:45:54,454 --> 00:45:56,456
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much for recognizing me.

454
00:45:56,476 --> 00:46:01,380
[SPEAKER_16]: Attorney Russell Chen here for the applicant, Rosen Boston Inc.

455
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:08,887
[SPEAKER_16]: Looking for a CV license to conduct business at the former Chili Garden location, 41 Riverside Avenue.

456
00:46:08,907 --> 00:46:17,095
[SPEAKER_16]: I am joined, I believe he is there in person, Mr. Guangping Ding, who is the principal of the applicant corporation.

457
00:46:18,277 --> 00:46:21,242
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, he is a simple change of ownership of this restaurant.

458
00:46:21,322 --> 00:46:31,257
[SPEAKER_16]: Mr. Ding intends to go in and just continue to conduct a similar business that would not be much in the way of renovation that to my knowledge that would take place.

459
00:46:33,021 --> 00:46:34,982
[SPEAKER_13]: I will go to Councilor Scarpelli.

460
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:39,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one question to the attorney while we have the hours of operations.

461
00:46:40,644 --> 00:46:41,805
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you continue those with us?

462
00:46:42,985 --> 00:46:46,447
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, I'm saying he would like to operate from 11 a.m.

463
00:46:46,467 --> 00:46:46,587
[SPEAKER_16]: to 10 p.m.

464
00:46:46,607 --> 00:46:47,127
[SPEAKER_16]: seven days a week.

465
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:50,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, perfect.

466
00:46:50,868 --> 00:47:00,152
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that sometimes when they go outside that I just would like to remind the petitioner that if it's later that that had to go through the process as well.

467
00:47:00,192 --> 00:47:03,933
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, Mr. President, I see everything in order.

468
00:47:04,534 --> 00:47:13,157
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited that we don't have an empty storefront and we see a responsible owner coming in and taking over and

469
00:47:14,638 --> 00:47:17,862
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I said, everything's in order.

470
00:47:18,603 --> 00:47:19,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I would move for approval.

471
00:47:19,845 --> 00:47:21,707
[SPEAKER_02]: My colleagues have any comments?

472
00:47:22,328 --> 00:47:22,908
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

473
00:47:23,129 --> 00:47:25,592
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion to approve by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by.

474
00:47:26,533 --> 00:47:27,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Seconded by Councilor Tseng.

475
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:29,316
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion by members of the Council?

476
00:47:30,979 --> 00:47:32,861
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none, is there any discussion by members of the public?

477
00:47:35,681 --> 00:47:48,989
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none, I just want to say good luck, congratulations, and we are excited to have you filling the, you know, Chili Garden's been a big community anchor, so we look forward to having you in there and doing your business.

478
00:47:49,049 --> 00:47:53,292
[SPEAKER_13]: So congratulations on the motion to approve.

479
00:47:54,412 --> 00:47:55,093
[SPEAKER_13]: All those in favor?

480
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:56,473
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

481
00:47:56,994 --> 00:47:57,734
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

482
00:47:57,794 --> 00:47:58,615
[SPEAKER_13]: Congratulations.

483
00:47:58,915 --> 00:48:00,776
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you very much for your support and have a good evening.

484
00:48:06,112 --> 00:48:06,592
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

485
00:48:07,373 --> 00:48:10,495
[SPEAKER_13]: Motions, orders, and resolutions.

486
00:48:10,515 --> 00:48:14,037
[SPEAKER_13]: 24-503 offered by Councilor Lazzaro, President Bears, and Vice President Collins.

487
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:17,099
[SPEAKER_13]: Let me get the full language here.

488
00:48:20,782 --> 00:48:27,166
[SPEAKER_13]: Whereas speed is one of the most important factors in traffic safety and crashes that occur at lower speeds cause less injury.

489
00:48:27,606 --> 00:48:38,152
[SPEAKER_13]: And whereas a pedestrian hit by a car traveling 40 miles per hour has a one in 10 chance of surviving a crash, while a pedestrian hit by a car traveling at 20 miles per hour has a nine in 10 chance of surviving.

490
00:48:39,213 --> 00:48:43,996
[SPEAKER_13]: And whereas Medford has set a citywide speed limit of 25 miles per hour on city controlled streets.

491
00:48:44,915 --> 00:49:09,182
[SPEAKER_13]: and whereas Medford has a high proportion of state-controlled roads, including Mystic Valley and Alewife Brook Parkways, Route 16, Route 28, Route 38, and High Street, Route 60, which are Medford's busiest thoroughfares, connecting Medford, the surrounding towns, and I-93, and passing through residential and commercial areas, impacting the safety of people walking, cycling, taking transit, and driving to school, work, parks, grocery stores, natural spaces, and city squares.

492
00:49:10,776 --> 00:49:21,380
[SPEAKER_13]: excuse me, and whereas Massachusetts general law chapter 90 section 18 allows city councils to petition state agencies to modify the speed limit on a state highway within their geographic boundaries.

493
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:36,305
[SPEAKER_13]: Now, therefore, be it resolved by the Medford city council that we respect the request and recommend that the Massachusetts department of conservation and recreation, DCR and Massachusetts department of transportation, MassDOT set the speed limit on route 16, route 28, route 38 and route 60 in Medford at 25 miles per hour.

494
00:49:36,325 --> 00:49:36,725
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Lazzaro.

495
00:49:42,947 --> 00:49:43,287
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

496
00:49:44,388 --> 00:50:08,030
[SPEAKER_08]: This is an issue that was brought to my attention by some local concerned citizens who, in particular, we were talking about Route 16 close to the Whole Foods where the guardrail has been crashed into and replaced so many times that it has its own Instagram account.

497
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:25,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, it's, uh, it's while we were walking through that intersection, we witnessed at least two, at least two extremely illegal and dangerous traffic violations that we pointed to, and we were like, like that, like that.

498
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:27,137
[SPEAKER_08]: It just kept happening.

499
00:50:27,757 --> 00:50:30,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, people drive really fast on Route 16 in particular.

500
00:50:30,718 --> 00:50:36,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and then, uh, as I was looking into it, I discovered what the other,

501
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:41,343
[SPEAKER_08]: that are controlled by state agencies.

502
00:50:41,403 --> 00:50:47,506
[SPEAKER_08]: This causes a lot of complications when we try to increase the safety of our roadways.

503
00:50:47,907 --> 00:50:49,328
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um.

504
00:50:50,068 --> 00:50:56,832
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to make a couple of notes on this resolution after looking into it and discussing the matter.

505
00:50:56,852 --> 00:51:02,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Um a couple of these roadways are now under local

506
00:51:06,898 --> 00:51:09,999
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can if we can amend that.

507
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:22,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Or I'm not sure if we need to amend it really the the mass general law chapter 90 section 18 says that we can basically petition those agencies to change their sections.

508
00:51:22,565 --> 00:51:24,586
[SPEAKER_08]: So really, all we're doing is we're saying

509
00:51:25,606 --> 00:51:35,317
[SPEAKER_08]: DCR, can you lower the speed limit of the roads that you control, mainly route 16 and 38 and 28, I think.

510
00:51:42,205 --> 00:51:45,006
[SPEAKER_08]: are up around 35 miles per hour is the limit.

511
00:51:45,206 --> 00:51:46,887
[SPEAKER_08]: And people do drive faster than that, of course.

512
00:51:47,927 --> 00:51:51,908
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's just like anything, we're not in charge of how people break the laws, we're only in charge of what the laws are.

513
00:51:52,428 --> 00:52:03,032
[SPEAKER_08]: So if we would like to move forward with it, we would say, we would ask these state agencies to change their, those roadways speed limits.

514
00:52:03,792 --> 00:52:06,013
[SPEAKER_08]: And what that does is,

515
00:52:08,527 --> 00:52:12,571
[SPEAKER_08]: lessens the likelihood that a crash would be a fatal crash.

516
00:52:13,432 --> 00:52:14,773
[SPEAKER_08]: And that is the hope.

517
00:52:15,834 --> 00:52:20,318
[SPEAKER_08]: It is a small step, but it is hopefully something in the direction of greater safety.

518
00:52:21,399 --> 00:52:23,641
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wanted to say thank you to

519
00:52:25,543 --> 00:52:27,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Walk Medford, Ellery Klein of Walk Medford.

520
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:32,466
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a ton of support from the Medford Bike Commission, Emily O'Brien.

521
00:52:34,728 --> 00:52:40,191
[SPEAKER_08]: We had support from Patricia, Senator Patricia Jalen's office, Matt Hartman, her chief of staff.

522
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,552
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a big group of people that did this walking.

523
00:52:43,692 --> 00:52:55,798
[SPEAKER_08]: of that intersection, but we talked a lot about there are a lot of really interested people and, um, traffic safety and just safety of human beings moving through the city is, of course, not I don't think it's very contentious issue.

524
00:52:56,319 --> 00:53:00,821
[SPEAKER_08]: Um so people do want to be safe where they live and work and travel.

525
00:53:00,921 --> 00:53:07,824
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is a this is something that I think can At least move in the direction of achieving that.

526
00:53:08,545 --> 00:53:08,785
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

527
00:53:11,425 --> 00:53:11,905
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

528
00:53:12,946 --> 00:53:15,168
[SPEAKER_13]: I will go to Councilor Callahan and then Vice President Collins.

529
00:53:15,789 --> 00:53:34,125
[SPEAKER_13]: But just before I do that, it might be worth the amendment being, saying Route 16, Route 28, Route 38, Route 60, and any other streets or highways controlled by state agencies, something like that as an amendment, just to be a catch-all.

530
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:49,043
[SPEAKER_08]: sorry, what I do wonder is if we would, if it would behoove us to ever take anything out of it, like we might as well just say anything that's state controlled, ask that the agency is lower the speed limit to 25 miles per hour.

531
00:53:49,063 --> 00:53:53,744
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, because I off the top of my head I'm thinking of South Border Road, Elm Street, Highland Avenue.

532
00:53:53,844 --> 00:53:54,244
[SPEAKER_08]: Exactly.

533
00:53:54,264 --> 00:54:00,726
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's a couple of other state, there's a Valley Parkway that's not part of Route 16 by the lakes.

534
00:54:01,026 --> 00:54:01,246
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean,

535
00:54:02,606 --> 00:54:10,032
[SPEAKER_13]: Someone said that I think Medford has the second highest proportion of state-controlled roads after Boston, which is pretty wild, but we do have a lot.

536
00:54:10,572 --> 00:54:12,954
[SPEAKER_13]: And 38 is partially city, partially state.

537
00:54:13,034 --> 00:54:15,556
[SPEAKER_13]: I think 60 is the only one that's all under city control.

538
00:54:15,797 --> 00:54:18,399
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think a catch-all amendment might be worth.

539
00:54:19,340 --> 00:54:20,280
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that you're right.

540
00:54:20,340 --> 00:54:30,368
[SPEAKER_08]: Rather than eliminating some that are technically city-controlled, to maybe just say any and all state-controlled roads, we petition that they be lowered to 25.

541
00:54:32,051 --> 00:54:32,211
[SPEAKER_13]: Yep.

542
00:54:32,872 --> 00:54:33,113
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

543
00:54:33,834 --> 00:54:37,018
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll go to Councilor Callahan and then Vice President Collins.

544
00:54:39,437 --> 00:54:39,997
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

545
00:54:40,477 --> 00:54:42,658
[SPEAKER_15]: I love the idea of having a catch all.

546
00:54:42,818 --> 00:54:52,301
[SPEAKER_15]: I was going to ask that we specifically mention South Border Road because there are a number of residents on the upper part of governors who have for many years been complaining about the safety issues.

547
00:54:52,361 --> 00:54:54,362
[SPEAKER_15]: They're really concerned about their kids.

548
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:58,664
[SPEAKER_15]: You know lots of very fast traffic because of South Border Road.

549
00:54:59,104 --> 00:55:08,387
[SPEAKER_15]: So I hope we can leave some specific mention of things as well as having a catch all and I would love to have South Border Road specifically called out in this resolution.

550
00:55:09,650 --> 00:55:09,790
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks.

551
00:55:10,651 --> 00:55:12,933
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Councilor Kelly, and I'll go to Vice President Collins.

552
00:55:14,774 --> 00:55:15,595
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, President Bears.

553
00:55:16,055 --> 00:55:21,280
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Lazzaro, thank you so much for putting this forward and to all of the collaborators from the community.

554
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:33,971
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that we have been hearing from safety advocates in the community for a long time about this, and I'm glad that we're doing this one small step towards a potential solution.

555
00:55:35,252 --> 00:55:36,333
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this one is really simple.

556
00:55:36,573 --> 00:55:42,378
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, we have a 25 mile per hour speed limit on city managed roads for a reason.

557
00:55:43,498 --> 00:55:48,503
[SPEAKER_05]: We struggle to maintain and enforce that speed limit on city roads as it is.

558
00:55:48,523 --> 00:55:54,187
[SPEAKER_05]: I heard a couple speeding complaints from residents twice in the past two days, and that was before the meeting started.

559
00:55:54,447 --> 00:55:58,391
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we heard about more traffic issues on Salem, about the lack of safety on Salem Street as well.

560
00:55:59,812 --> 00:56:15,541
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really need the state's help in creating a culture of safe road speeds here in Medford and around the region, because it's just intuitive, you know, people whip on the roads in Medford, they whip on the state roads, and they bring that speed to the neighborhoods, and it's incredibly dangerous, it's incredibly scary.

561
00:56:17,142 --> 00:56:26,371
[SPEAKER_05]: So I hope that this will send a really clear message to DCR and DOT that Medford wants this.

562
00:56:26,731 --> 00:56:31,616
[SPEAKER_05]: We do not want this fast traffic from these state roads bleeding into the neighborhoods anymore.

563
00:56:32,436 --> 00:56:38,242
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you so much for putting this together and thank you so much to everybody in the community who's been raising the alarm about this as well for a long time.

564
00:56:40,236 --> 00:56:41,317
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Vice President Collins.

565
00:56:41,357 --> 00:56:48,524
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, as someone who grew up on a state road, Fells Bay West, but has spent many years

566
00:56:50,751 --> 00:56:59,981
[SPEAKER_13]: looking out my driver's side mirror or looking left and right across the street, worried that someone's going to come whipping down Fells Bay West in the one-way section at 45 miles an hour.

567
00:57:00,001 --> 00:57:05,067
[SPEAKER_13]: And they have taken out two of our cars and a tree in that time.

568
00:57:05,087 --> 00:57:09,191
[SPEAKER_13]: And luckily, no people, but that's probably only because there's no crosswalks.

569
00:57:09,291 --> 00:57:10,352
[SPEAKER_13]: And the only thing

570
00:57:11,173 --> 00:57:12,414
[SPEAKER_13]: To our West is 93.

571
00:57:12,935 --> 00:57:16,417
[SPEAKER_13]: There's other parts that are even much more dangerous.

572
00:57:17,018 --> 00:57:18,559
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm a huge supporter of this resolution.

573
00:57:18,579 --> 00:57:27,947
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm also directly experienced what it's like to lose someone in another community, not in Medford to traffic violence so

574
00:57:28,807 --> 00:57:30,449
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, it's just important to me.

575
00:57:30,689 --> 00:57:52,187
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have here a suggested amendment in the last sentence, set the speed limit on any street, highway, or portion of a street or highway controlled by a state agency, including but not limited to Route 16, Route 28, Route 38, Route 60, South Border Road, Elm Street, and Highland Ave in Medford at 25 miles per hour.

576
00:57:54,508 --> 00:57:54,949
[SPEAKER_13]: Sound good?

577
00:57:56,750 --> 00:57:57,471
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll make that amendment?

578
00:58:00,402 --> 00:58:00,842
[SPEAKER_13]: I wrote it down.

579
00:58:03,844 --> 00:58:12,349
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion of Councilor Lazzaro to approve the resolution as amended, seconded by Councilor Callahan, is there any further discussion by members of the Council?

580
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:16,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none, any discussion by members of the public?

581
00:58:17,512 --> 00:58:18,372
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

582
00:58:18,432 --> 00:58:20,994
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please, and you have three minutes.

583
00:58:21,820 --> 00:58:22,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Hello.

584
00:58:22,581 --> 00:58:24,383
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Ellery Klein.

585
00:58:24,743 --> 00:58:34,014
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm 37 Fells Avenue and chair of Walk Medford and also a member of the Safe Routes to School Medford Citywide Task Force, which was formed last year.

586
00:58:34,495 --> 00:58:37,398
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've been a walking and biking to school leader now for 11 years.

587
00:58:39,681 --> 00:58:42,064
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have been asking for this for a while.

588
00:58:42,124 --> 00:58:48,971
[SPEAKER_07]: This was made a change in state law in 2023, thanks to many advocates.

589
00:58:49,692 --> 00:58:53,436
[SPEAKER_07]: As we've said, we've had this 25 mile an hour speed limit here for years and years.

590
00:58:54,937 --> 00:58:56,659
[SPEAKER_07]: yet we have all these state roads.

591
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:00,842
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thank you so much for finally bringing this forward.

592
00:59:00,882 --> 00:59:04,365
[SPEAKER_07]: I know we were busy with the overrides, so it's great that this got right on the plate.

593
00:59:04,986 --> 00:59:09,610
[SPEAKER_07]: I will just say that, you know, if you walk up, I live in Fulton Heights.

594
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:20,980
[SPEAKER_07]: If you start at Wellington, you know, you're looking at the road down there by the shopping centers where people are waiting for the buses with no protection, no bollards, nothing, and people are whipping by at 45 miles an hour because the speed limit is 35 down there.

595
00:59:22,521 --> 00:59:27,187
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you get to where I live on Fells Way West between Salem and Fulton Street.

596
00:59:27,467 --> 00:59:30,691
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have about 500, 600 kids up in Fulton Heights.

597
00:59:31,552 --> 00:59:35,397
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're about to spend, we've already spent, I think, I can't remember, $200,000 on the RFFB.

598
00:59:38,761 --> 00:59:42,604
[SPEAKER_07]: at Hickey Park there, and I've seen multiple crashes happen.

599
00:59:43,165 --> 00:59:48,810
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, blinking lights don't really help when people are driving 45 miles an hour.

600
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:53,735
[SPEAKER_07]: It's set at 30, but people whip down that road at incredibly fast speeds.

601
00:59:55,837 --> 01:00:00,621
[SPEAKER_07]: So and they were recently serving to do more of the Safer to School grant work.

602
01:00:00,641 --> 01:00:05,406
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's gonna be a total of about a million dollars they're gonna spend to supposedly help kids cross.

603
01:00:05,446 --> 01:00:14,455
[SPEAKER_07]: But if we don't actually address the speeds on Fells Way West, no kid is ever gonna be able to cross the street to go to school or the park or the square by themselves.

604
01:00:14,715 --> 01:00:17,077
[SPEAKER_07]: The parents, if you talk to any parent in the city,

605
01:00:18,058 --> 01:00:22,863
[SPEAKER_07]: They just don't feel safe at all letting their kids walk and bike around themselves.

606
01:00:23,103 --> 01:00:31,191
[SPEAKER_07]: But we are a city that's very compact, and kids should be able to grow up and have the freedom and independence in the city that safety like this would provide.

607
01:00:31,251 --> 01:00:35,295
[SPEAKER_07]: So obviously, this would just be a change in the speed limit.

608
01:00:35,775 --> 01:00:40,240
[SPEAKER_07]: But hopefully, it sends a signal to the state that Medford would like

609
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:43,241
[SPEAKER_07]: these agencies to take safety seriously.

610
01:00:43,481 --> 01:00:56,366
[SPEAKER_07]: And once they have the speed marked, then the pressure is on them to actually engineer the roads and design them so that drivers have to drive these speeds that are safe for our communities.

611
01:00:57,166 --> 01:01:09,471
[SPEAKER_07]: And there'll be other effects too with less noise pollution, less exhaust, less crashes, and just generally better quality of life and more community cohesion as people are more able to walk and bike around.

612
01:01:10,131 --> 01:01:11,932
[SPEAKER_07]: say hi to their neighbors and smile at babies.

613
01:01:11,992 --> 01:01:13,072
[SPEAKER_07]: So, all right.

614
01:01:13,212 --> 01:01:14,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you so much for this.

615
01:01:15,093 --> 01:01:15,713
[SPEAKER_07]: I appreciate it.

616
01:01:16,473 --> 01:01:17,053
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Ellery.

617
01:01:17,093 --> 01:01:19,194
[SPEAKER_13]: And I'd start with less drag racing myself.

618
01:01:21,615 --> 01:01:27,977
[SPEAKER_13]: If we have anyone else who'd like to speak in person, you can come to the podium or on Zoom, raise your hand on Zoom.

619
01:01:28,697 --> 01:01:30,558
[SPEAKER_13]: I do see Mr. Castagnetti on Zoom.

620
01:01:31,218 --> 01:01:34,899
[SPEAKER_13]: I will unmute you, Mr. Castagnetti, name and address for the record, and then we'll go back to the podium.

621
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:44,121
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Castagnetti, do you want to speak on this item?

622
01:01:49,647 --> 01:01:50,628
[SPEAKER_13]: It may have been an error in hand.

623
01:01:51,109 --> 01:01:52,030
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, we got him.

624
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:52,490
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.

625
01:01:53,111 --> 01:01:54,472
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Castagnetti, name and address for the record.

626
01:01:54,492 --> 01:01:55,133
[SPEAKER_13]: You have three minutes.

627
01:01:56,587 --> 01:01:59,870
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, Andrew Castagnetti, Cushion Street, Bedford, Massachusetts.

628
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:08,697
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to commend and thank Councilor Lazzaro for bringing up a very dangerous spot in that area, that curve on Route 16.

629
01:02:08,777 --> 01:02:11,099
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's near Whole Foods.

630
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:20,967
[SPEAKER_01]: Matter of fact, I think that speed limit, they should have a reduced speed down to like 10 miles per hour, especially if there's ice on that curve.

631
01:02:21,027 --> 01:02:22,007
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a dangerous curve.

632
01:02:22,468 --> 01:02:25,150
[SPEAKER_01]: I've negotiated many times, and once I had

633
01:02:25,874 --> 01:02:26,774
[SPEAKER_01]: Very little success.

634
01:02:27,054 --> 01:02:29,315
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up wiping out in front of Whole Foods.

635
01:02:29,335 --> 01:02:29,895
[SPEAKER_01]: I hit the curb.

636
01:02:30,155 --> 01:02:35,817
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost two tires back in 1969 while I was commuting to Honeywell in Waltham.

637
01:02:36,377 --> 01:02:38,938
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I disagree.

638
01:02:39,318 --> 01:02:45,140
[SPEAKER_01]: You should not lower the 35 mile an hour limit, in my opinion, on the other parts of the state roads.

639
01:02:45,681 --> 01:02:52,883
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're coming from Boston on Route 28, heading to a station landing, you might be in dangerous, more dangerous,

640
01:02:53,695 --> 01:03:00,179
[SPEAKER_01]: troubles with a speed limit of 25, because they're moving pretty fast.

641
01:03:04,202 --> 01:03:09,646
[SPEAKER_01]: The city itself, it lowered the speed limits, I believe, within the city of 25 miles per hour.

642
01:03:10,106 --> 01:03:15,430
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it would be an opposite effect.

643
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:18,492
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would cause more problems on the rest of the roads.

644
01:03:18,872 --> 01:03:21,574
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, who would enforce these tickets?

645
01:03:26,792 --> 01:03:30,814
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe state police enforces speed on the state-controlled roads.

646
01:03:32,695 --> 01:03:33,776
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, I said my piece.

647
01:03:33,896 --> 01:03:40,039
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that curve in front of Whole Foods, very dangerous from past experience, I know.

648
01:03:40,059 --> 01:03:44,882
[SPEAKER_01]: That could reduce speed down to 10 miles per hour.

649
01:03:45,722 --> 01:03:48,444
[SPEAKER_01]: But the rest of the state highways, I would let it be.

650
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:53,146
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would compromise if I had a choice, if I had the power, instead of 25, maybe go to 30,

651
01:03:55,504 --> 01:04:00,408
[SPEAKER_01]: And in between, we could settle between 25 and 35 miles per hour.

652
01:04:00,788 --> 01:04:01,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for listening.

653
01:04:01,648 --> 01:04:02,069
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to go.

654
01:04:02,229 --> 01:04:02,409
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.

655
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:04,290
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. Castagnetti.

656
01:04:07,633 --> 01:04:09,094
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll go to Martha at the podium.

657
01:04:09,114 --> 01:04:10,835
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please.

658
01:04:10,895 --> 01:04:11,816
[SPEAKER_13]: You have three minutes.

659
01:04:12,409 --> 01:04:14,070
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Martha Andres.

660
01:04:14,170 --> 01:04:17,873
[SPEAKER_06]: I live at 45 Kilgore Avenue in West Medford.

661
01:04:19,514 --> 01:04:23,957
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank Councilor Lazzaro and others for supporting this measure.

662
01:04:25,298 --> 01:04:30,341
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like a very, doesn't cost us anything.

663
01:04:31,342 --> 01:04:35,845
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a very effective measure to change the culture so that

664
01:04:37,524 --> 01:04:44,787
[SPEAKER_06]: the 25 mile an hour habit begins to form for the state roads as well as for our local roads.

665
01:04:45,487 --> 01:04:57,812
[SPEAKER_06]: I crossed a state road every morning walking my dog and it's interesting to see how many near accidents there are when I'm in a crosswalk of people who are going too fast.

666
01:04:59,832 --> 01:05:05,314
[SPEAKER_06]: realizing they have to stop or the people behind them not realizing that they've stopped.

667
01:05:06,055 --> 01:05:08,215
[SPEAKER_06]: We're human and we're going fast.

668
01:05:09,096 --> 01:05:16,478
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't take in information and we don't act on information as quickly as we need to to be safe.

669
01:05:16,618 --> 01:05:19,639
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think this is a good cultural change.

670
01:05:20,080 --> 01:05:26,542
[SPEAKER_06]: I know there are areas of my neighborhood, shops, small businesses, parks, where I would be far more likely to go

671
01:05:27,142 --> 01:05:32,524
[SPEAKER_06]: if I didn't have to cross High Street and other dangerous streets.

672
01:05:32,544 --> 01:05:35,305
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you for listening, and thank you for this measure.

673
01:05:36,965 --> 01:05:37,465
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

674
01:05:37,546 --> 01:05:38,346
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll go to Zoom.

675
01:05:38,966 --> 01:05:41,767
[SPEAKER_13]: Emily Stein from the Safe Roads Alliance.

676
01:05:42,507 --> 01:05:43,588
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record, please.

677
01:05:46,889 --> 01:05:49,189
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, I'm Emily Stein, 177 High Street.

678
01:05:53,073 --> 01:05:57,054
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just wanted to echo what Ellery and Martha said.

679
01:05:57,274 --> 01:05:59,134
[SPEAKER_14]: I run Safe Roads Alliance.

680
01:05:59,174 --> 01:06:08,397
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a local nonprofit, mostly focused on educating drivers about how to share the roads with vulnerable road users, people walking and biking.

681
01:06:08,417 --> 01:06:11,777
[SPEAKER_14]: And also I focus on distracted driving prevention.

682
01:06:13,638 --> 01:06:17,879
[SPEAKER_14]: I was just at the state house today talking to legislators about

683
01:06:19,255 --> 01:06:22,539
[SPEAKER_14]: speed, safety cameras, red light cameras.

684
01:06:23,481 --> 01:06:32,093
[SPEAKER_14]: And it seems like this is going to be what we hope will be a lot more municipal opt-in traffic safety measures.

685
01:06:32,995 --> 01:06:34,357
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's fantastic.

686
01:06:35,057 --> 01:06:48,886
[SPEAKER_14]: If the Council pushes this forward, it'd be great to have Medford be one of the leads in pushing DCR to lower their speed limits and also kind of weighing in at the Boston Region MPO.

687
01:06:49,628 --> 01:06:52,250
[SPEAKER_14]: Metropolitan Planning Organization.

688
01:06:52,911 --> 01:07:03,079
[SPEAKER_14]: As they're developing their Vision Zero action plan, they are wanting to have policies that they can share with other municipalities on how to make their streets safer.

689
01:07:03,139 --> 01:07:12,547
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you see these DCR roads as corridors that need full safety improvements along the whole corridors, it's great.

690
01:07:12,587 --> 01:07:14,188
[SPEAKER_14]: Medford will be a leader.

691
01:07:14,409 --> 01:07:18,392
[SPEAKER_14]: So thank you all, and thank you to the advocates for putting this in.

692
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:30,832
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Emily, and please reach out and let us know, Ellery, to anyone in the city, how we can support further efforts for regional and state coordination on road safety.

693
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:35,873
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further discussion by members of the Council?

694
01:07:35,973 --> 01:07:37,974
[SPEAKER_13]: Seeing none, I will go to the public.

695
01:07:40,495 --> 01:07:41,635
[SPEAKER_13]: Name and address for the record.

696
01:07:41,675 --> 01:07:42,995
[SPEAKER_13]: You have three minutes.

697
01:07:44,295 --> 01:07:45,756
[SPEAKER_09]: Paulette Vartabedian, Central Lab.

698
01:07:47,045 --> 01:07:55,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Emily, for bringing this up because I do agree that the speed limit does need to be lowered, even though we do have 25 mile an hour citywide.

699
01:07:55,969 --> 01:07:59,771
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of the roads, even the city roads, they go so fast.

700
01:08:00,331 --> 01:08:08,075
[SPEAKER_09]: I travel on South border road a lot and I go the speed limit or a little bit more maybe.

701
01:08:08,495 --> 01:08:12,937
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've had people on my butt and people go around me and pass me.

702
01:08:14,026 --> 01:08:19,411
[SPEAKER_09]: when I think I'm going at a decent speed and I think it's very important.

703
01:08:19,471 --> 01:08:25,036
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing too is some of these roads that go into the adjoining towns, we have to

704
01:08:25,618 --> 01:08:31,542
[SPEAKER_09]: maybe try to work with those towns to get that continuous road on the same speed.

705
01:08:32,002 --> 01:08:34,364
[SPEAKER_09]: So say South Border Road goes into Winchester.

706
01:08:34,644 --> 01:08:44,351
[SPEAKER_09]: If we're going to have a 25 mile an hour, which is now 30, go into 25 mile an hour, we want to make sure that it's posted at the Medford-Winchester border.

707
01:08:44,991 --> 01:08:55,038
[SPEAKER_09]: So people can't say, oh, it just said it was 30 or something, and maybe get Winchester and or the other towns similar to go in with us on that.

708
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:56,919
[SPEAKER_09]: continuous road.

709
01:08:57,819 --> 01:09:00,821
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think it's a great idea and I hope it passes.

710
01:09:01,201 --> 01:09:09,045
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wish we could be like New York that we had these cameras that flash and get you your license plate because we get so much money for the city.

711
01:09:09,825 --> 01:09:10,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

712
01:09:11,866 --> 01:09:12,307
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

713
01:09:12,387 --> 01:09:16,409
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, and I did want to just note enforcement is something

714
01:09:17,714 --> 01:09:18,675
[SPEAKER_13]: that we need more of.

715
01:09:18,875 --> 01:09:29,660
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, it's not a state-controlled road, but I was on Winthrop Street coming down the hill from Tufts six weeks ago, and I'm doing 20, maybe 25, but 20 going down to 15 to go over the raised crosswalk in front of the church.

716
01:09:30,420 --> 01:09:39,385
[SPEAKER_13]: Guy whips around me 45 miles an hour, left lane, opposite lane, oncoming traffic, and he's not all the way back into the right lane until Goldilocks.

717
01:09:39,685 --> 01:09:40,966
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, and you had people

718
01:09:42,082 --> 01:09:45,365
[SPEAKER_13]: trying to cross at West Street, trying to cross up a little further at Summer Street.

719
01:09:45,425 --> 01:09:47,447
[SPEAKER_13]: It was just awful to see.

720
01:09:47,527 --> 01:09:53,271
[SPEAKER_13]: And I, of course, immediately pulled over on South Street and called the chief because I had the license plate number.

721
01:09:53,432 --> 01:09:57,995
[SPEAKER_13]: And he says, we can't do anything but pull the plate, call them, and say, hey, you can't do that.

722
01:09:58,055 --> 01:10:00,177
[SPEAKER_13]: But I can't enforce the law.

723
01:10:01,178 --> 01:10:02,919
[SPEAKER_13]: So we need more enforcement.

724
01:10:05,161 --> 01:10:12,047
[SPEAKER_13]: that, you know, I used to have some more concerns about the safe traffic cameras that I do now, given how people have been driving.

725
01:10:12,267 --> 01:10:18,392
[SPEAKER_13]: So with that, any further discussion on this item or public participation will go to Councilor Tseng.

726
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:20,070
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

727
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:23,911
[SPEAKER_12]: I just wanted to thank folks for giving us their input about this.

728
01:10:25,192 --> 01:10:39,617
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, these conversations can be contentious in different communities, but I think in Medford here, we really do value safety and we really do value, we see that it's not at conflict with having a good standard of living.

729
01:10:39,757 --> 01:10:45,019
[SPEAKER_12]: We know that safety is at the core of having a good standard of living here.

730
01:10:46,536 --> 01:10:49,939
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I spend much of my life as a pedestrian.

731
01:10:49,959 --> 01:10:53,723
[SPEAKER_12]: I get made fun of a lot for it, but I do love walking around.

732
01:10:54,163 --> 01:10:55,824
[SPEAKER_12]: That includes crossing state roads.

733
01:10:56,145 --> 01:11:01,009
[SPEAKER_12]: I think anyone who, and I grew up near, very, a block away from the Fellsway.

734
01:11:01,069 --> 01:11:07,715
[SPEAKER_12]: So anyone who has very regularly crossed those roads knows the mad dash, right?

735
01:11:07,755 --> 01:11:10,758
[SPEAKER_12]: The sprint that you make to avoid being hit.

736
01:11:11,838 --> 01:11:16,781
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really easy to pinpoint one or two anecdotes right here and there by all these different roads.

737
01:11:16,901 --> 01:11:22,465
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it tells us something when we have anecdotes about every single road in Medford.

738
01:11:23,005 --> 01:11:27,928
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that's at the core why, for me, I'll be voting yes on this tonight.

739
01:11:29,268 --> 01:11:35,412
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it's just logical to bring our roads all in line with our citywide speed limit as well.

740
01:11:36,957 --> 01:11:37,277
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

741
01:11:37,297 --> 01:11:37,377
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

742
01:11:37,397 --> 01:11:40,701
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think, you know, there's several processes to be on the lookout for as well.

743
01:11:41,361 --> 01:11:52,532
[SPEAKER_13]: Wellington Circle redesign, the Mystic Avenue, Main Street, Medford Square corridor design process, which is ongoing, and High Street and Mystic Valley Parkway at the Arlington border as well.

744
01:11:52,572 --> 01:11:55,775
[SPEAKER_13]: I know there's designs for shrinking those rotaries.

745
01:11:56,828 --> 01:11:58,489
[SPEAKER_13]: the lane width at those rotaries as well.

746
01:11:58,509 --> 01:12:06,132
[SPEAKER_13]: And those are some really major projects that we should all be paying attention to, um, in terms of design and making sure that they're gonna keep us safe.

747
01:12:06,452 --> 01:12:17,476
[SPEAKER_13]: So seeing no further discussion on the motion of Councilors are seconded by Council Vice President Collins as amended by Councilors are all those in favor.

748
01:12:18,236 --> 01:12:18,656
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

749
01:12:18,736 --> 01:12:19,517
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.

750
01:12:20,697 --> 01:12:22,697
[SPEAKER_13]: Last thing we have on the agenda, public participation.

751
01:12:23,138 --> 01:12:29,979
[SPEAKER_13]: If you have public participation on any item that was not otherwise on the agenda, you can come to the podium or raise your hand on Zoom.

752
01:12:30,139 --> 01:12:33,220
[SPEAKER_13]: And I will go to Mr. Fiore, name and address for the record.

753
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:34,300
[SPEAKER_13]: You have three minutes.

754
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,940
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you very much, Mr. President.

755
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:40,741
[SPEAKER_10]: I just had a few comments, semi-related to the last item.

756
01:12:40,761 --> 01:12:43,182
[SPEAKER_10]: So I didn't want to take the time for specific that agenda item.

757
01:12:44,002 --> 01:12:48,583
[SPEAKER_10]: So first of all, on South Border Road, there's no crosswalk

758
01:12:49,252 --> 01:12:51,494
[SPEAKER_10]: either on the cross Fells Trail.

759
01:12:51,674 --> 01:13:08,651
[SPEAKER_10]: So as you go from Lawrence Estates part of the Fells Reservation to the main part of the reservation, there's a witness an accident there because like, so when hikers kind of go through and the car sort of stops, the cars behind the car, they don't realize, and then they just like rear end.

760
01:13:09,071 --> 01:13:10,633
[SPEAKER_10]: There's actually debris right now there.

761
01:13:10,673 --> 01:13:13,816
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you go like there was an accident, I don't know, not that long ago, probably.

762
01:13:14,916 --> 01:13:21,899
[SPEAKER_10]: So if we could do something to at least put a sign, if not a crosswalk to, you know, so cars are a little bit more aware that there might be people crossing.

763
01:13:22,319 --> 01:13:24,040
[SPEAKER_10]: Same thing on Governor's Ave.

764
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:30,242
[SPEAKER_10]: So when it reaches the falls, a lot of people just cross because there's like a fire road that goes into the falls there and people cross.

765
01:13:31,303 --> 01:13:35,844
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no sort of like even a sign that says like, oh, you know, people might be crossing here.

766
01:13:36,285 --> 01:13:38,185
[SPEAKER_10]: So that might be something to address.

767
01:13:39,926 --> 01:13:47,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, so you mentioned that Medford might be the city after Boston that has the highest proportion of state control roads.

768
01:13:47,468 --> 01:13:49,389
[SPEAKER_10]: So I've been thinking about this.

769
01:13:49,429 --> 01:13:51,449
[SPEAKER_10]: So who maintains those roads?

770
01:13:51,689 --> 01:13:56,650
[SPEAKER_10]: So whenever they need, you know, there's potholes or something, they need to be fixed.

771
01:13:56,971 --> 01:13:58,571
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that Medford or is that

772
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:01,340
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a complicated question.

773
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:06,367
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, there are state routes like Route 60 that are city controlled.

774
01:14:06,847 --> 01:14:09,430
[SPEAKER_13]: Most of High Street and Salem Street is city controlled.

775
01:14:09,971 --> 01:14:18,201
[SPEAKER_13]: So I believe Medford does repairs on those the state controlled portions of state road state routes or non state routes, the agency.

776
01:14:20,083 --> 01:14:21,524
[SPEAKER_13]: that controls them is responsible.

777
01:14:21,584 --> 01:14:25,105
[SPEAKER_13]: So, for example, I lived on Fells Way West.

778
01:14:25,125 --> 01:14:34,169
[SPEAKER_13]: Our snow shoveling and snow removal, that's DCR region, I can't remember the region number, but it's the region that's up at Spot Pond, the headquarters there.

779
01:14:34,249 --> 01:14:40,932
[SPEAKER_13]: So Medford snow shoveling and street sweeping rules don't apply to that section of Fells Way West, nor does maintenance or redesign.

780
01:14:41,892 --> 01:14:43,393
[SPEAKER_13]: It's actually also one of the reasons that

781
01:14:44,053 --> 01:14:54,964
[SPEAKER_13]: Main Street and Mystic Ave and Medford Square, that intersection design is so complicated, a portion of the streets are city controlled, a portion of the streets are DCR, and a portion of the streets are MassDOT.

782
01:14:55,345 --> 01:14:59,789
[SPEAKER_13]: So you had to get all three of those groups together to approve design.

783
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:05,635
[SPEAKER_13]: And probably when it's done, you'll have different agencies maintaining different parts of that intersection.

784
01:15:07,116 --> 01:15:08,957
[SPEAKER_13]: That's my general understanding of how it works.

785
01:15:09,537 --> 01:15:18,902
[SPEAKER_13]: It's probably even more specific stuff but for example, if you're going up fells way west towards stone them, or you can turn right onto Elm Street.

786
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:26,446
[SPEAKER_13]: They put a paint bump out to change the angle of the curve because it was really steep and people were just whipping right up Elm.

787
01:15:27,244 --> 01:15:28,005
[SPEAKER_13]: but it was just paint.

788
01:15:28,585 --> 01:15:36,692
[SPEAKER_13]: I remember talking with director Blake about putting bollards out to further try to make people actually follow the new curve.

789
01:15:37,553 --> 01:15:40,956
[SPEAKER_13]: And DCR said that they wouldn't do it.

790
01:15:40,976 --> 01:15:46,461
[SPEAKER_13]: They didn't have the staff to maintain the bollards and Todd and DPW offered to do it ourselves.

791
01:15:46,481 --> 01:15:47,602
[SPEAKER_13]: And they said, we won't let you do that.

792
01:15:48,202 --> 01:15:51,786
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's jurisdictional questions that create some

793
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:53,775
[SPEAKER_13]: really frustrating issues.

794
01:15:54,235 --> 01:15:55,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it would be interesting.

795
01:15:55,636 --> 01:16:09,307
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm going to try to get the data because it would be interesting to actually compute, you know, what what in terms of like our total road length, what percentage is actually, you know, we cannot control in terms of maintenance, for example, and then the same issue with private roads.

796
01:16:09,347 --> 01:16:13,251
[SPEAKER_10]: So I live in a private road and then there's a section that is actually in pretty bad shape.

797
01:16:14,591 --> 01:16:16,532
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been going through the process of trying to repave it.

798
01:16:16,552 --> 01:16:17,573
[SPEAKER_10]: The city won't repave it.

799
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:19,994
[SPEAKER_10]: The only thing that they do is just patching.

800
01:16:20,474 --> 01:16:22,936
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think it would be interesting to have this data.

801
01:16:22,956 --> 01:16:30,680
[SPEAKER_10]: So then when the conversation comes about, for example, the DPW budget, then we can compare, well, this is how much we're spending compared to, for example, some of it.

802
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:37,103
[SPEAKER_10]: But at the same time, we might have less roads that we can actually maintain, for example, private roads or roads around the DCR.

803
01:16:37,383 --> 01:16:42,026
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think it would be interesting to just have the data so then we can talk based on facts.

804
01:16:43,745 --> 01:16:45,974
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's it.

805
01:16:46,496 --> 01:16:46,737
[SPEAKER_10]: Yep.

806
01:16:47,199 --> 01:16:48,223
[SPEAKER_10]: But tell what the road.

807
01:16:48,953 --> 01:16:50,214
[SPEAKER_10]: There's accidents all the time.

808
01:16:50,354 --> 01:16:53,717
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, it's not necessarily a car that goes over a pedestrian.

809
01:16:53,897 --> 01:16:58,961
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like the first car slows down or breaks and the next cars are just doing something else.

810
01:16:59,882 --> 01:17:02,004
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't realize and there's an accident.

811
01:17:02,024 --> 01:17:03,965
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, cyclists on that street too.

812
01:17:03,985 --> 01:17:09,049
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I would have a really, I mean, it seems like a great place to go on a bike ride and then you're there.

813
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:11,011
[SPEAKER_10]: I mentioned the good bike racks.

814
01:17:11,271 --> 01:17:12,793
[SPEAKER_10]: So people can actually bike to the falls.

815
01:17:12,813 --> 01:17:13,293
[SPEAKER_10]: There's none.

816
01:17:13,873 --> 01:17:17,196
[SPEAKER_10]: And now that I think about it, last thing is like, so also people dump trash.

817
01:17:17,596 --> 01:17:17,797
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

818
01:17:18,417 --> 01:17:19,938
[SPEAKER_10]: In those areas of the files.

819
01:17:20,479 --> 01:17:28,025
[SPEAKER_10]: So enforcement, not only related to traffic, but we could put a camera or something to see figure out who is actually dumping trash.

820
01:17:28,245 --> 01:17:29,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

821
01:17:29,666 --> 01:17:31,287
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's just, it's just not nice.

822
01:17:31,647 --> 01:17:35,951
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a couple larger conversations DCR at the state level.

823
01:17:37,423 --> 01:17:43,645
[SPEAKER_13]: It used to be even more ridiculous how many agencies controlled different parkways and roadways, and they were regionalized.

824
01:17:43,725 --> 01:17:47,066
[SPEAKER_13]: And you had the old MDC and different regional district commissions.

825
01:17:47,126 --> 01:17:49,987
[SPEAKER_13]: And I won't go into it, but that all got merged into DCR.

826
01:17:50,427 --> 01:17:53,468
[SPEAKER_13]: But it still doesn't make a ton of sense to have DCR maintaining all of these roads.

827
01:17:54,188 --> 01:17:55,329
[SPEAKER_13]: MassDOT should probably be doing it.

828
01:17:55,349 --> 01:17:56,369
[SPEAKER_13]: It should be centralized.

829
01:17:56,569 --> 01:17:57,889
[SPEAKER_13]: DCR is deeply underfunded.

830
01:17:59,410 --> 01:18:01,791
[SPEAKER_13]: I think, yeah, I could go into that forever.

831
01:18:01,831 --> 01:18:05,312
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's another piece of the problem with the enforcement on,

832
01:18:06,112 --> 01:18:08,573
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, fells by going up towards stone or south border road.

833
01:18:10,374 --> 01:18:23,841
[SPEAKER_13]: Snow shoveling, I mean it was ridiculous you know they won't even put up bollards to because they're like what if someone we don't have the staff capacity to put them back up if they get knocked down, so that was their justification so that that funding issue with DC ours and there's a problem to that needs to get solved.

834
01:18:24,941 --> 01:18:25,942
[SPEAKER_13]: But I appreciate the comment.

835
01:18:26,042 --> 01:18:37,249
[SPEAKER_13]: And the one other thing is that the Chapter 90 money that we get, which is basically the only money most cities use for street maintenance, is based on just the proportion of the public ways that are in the city control.

836
01:18:37,469 --> 01:18:39,450
[SPEAKER_13]: So the state-controlled roads are out of it.

837
01:18:39,490 --> 01:18:40,511
[SPEAKER_13]: The private ways are out of it.

838
01:18:41,455 --> 01:18:43,236
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's the money from the state, basically.

839
01:18:43,316 --> 01:18:43,536
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

840
01:18:43,616 --> 01:18:52,780
[SPEAKER_13]: And that formula is also deeply underfunded, but we get an even shorter end of the stick because we have such a smaller proportion of the mileage in the city is actually controlled by the city.

841
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:53,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Interesting.

842
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:54,261
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

843
01:18:54,381 --> 01:18:54,981
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.

844
01:18:55,001 --> 01:18:55,361
[SPEAKER_13]: You got it.

845
01:18:55,541 --> 01:18:55,881
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

846
01:18:56,742 --> 01:18:59,243
[SPEAKER_13]: Any further public participation, either in person or on Zoom?

847
01:19:02,244 --> 01:19:03,405
[SPEAKER_13]: We have Steve Schnapp.

848
01:19:03,465 --> 01:19:05,766
[SPEAKER_13]: Steve, name and address for the record, please.

849
01:19:05,786 --> 01:19:06,646
[SPEAKER_13]: You have three minutes.

850
01:19:08,727 --> 01:19:11,569
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Steve Schnapp, 36 Hillside Ave.

851
01:19:11,729 --> 01:19:12,489
[SPEAKER_00]: in Medford Square.

852
01:19:13,429 --> 01:19:18,732
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a quick question and then a request, or maybe the other way around.

853
01:19:19,993 --> 01:19:25,435
[SPEAKER_00]: The request is that when you use acronyms, perhaps at least once, say what they are.

854
01:19:25,955 --> 01:19:28,937
[SPEAKER_00]: Most folks know what MassDOT is, not everybody does.

855
01:19:30,137 --> 01:19:37,181
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just helpful when using an acronym to first let folks know what it means.

856
01:19:39,203 --> 01:19:55,701
[SPEAKER_00]: The second question I have is I've noticed on the agenda for several meetings that there's a report under reports due and deadlines, a quarterly presentation on the city's financial health by the CFO.

857
01:19:58,052 --> 01:20:10,022
[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that on the agenda item many times, but I've never heard or haven't heard in those meetings discussion of that, whether the reports come into the city council.

858
01:20:12,565 --> 01:20:13,826
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just curious about that.

859
01:20:14,026 --> 01:20:14,366
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all.

860
01:20:15,968 --> 01:20:16,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

861
01:20:16,388 --> 01:20:17,809
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll have to check my email.

862
01:20:17,849 --> 01:20:19,831
[SPEAKER_13]: We did receive a report for quarter one.

863
01:20:22,483 --> 01:20:26,265
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I think it was within the last two weeks or maybe early November.

864
01:20:27,306 --> 01:20:35,111
[SPEAKER_13]: It would be incumbent on a councillor to move that item from unfinished business to take it up from the table for us to discuss it.

865
01:20:35,651 --> 01:20:40,274
[SPEAKER_13]: So if councillors want to do that, they're free to do so at any time.

866
01:20:40,554 --> 01:20:47,338
[SPEAKER_13]: And we do have a report that we got from the administration on fiscal 25 quarter one finances.

867
01:20:48,739 --> 01:20:50,040
[SPEAKER_13]: And I will work on the acronym thing.

868
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:50,480
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, Steve.

869
01:20:53,871 --> 01:20:56,897
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, any further discussion by members of the council?

870
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:02,649
[SPEAKER_13]: On the motion to adjourn by Councilor Scarpelli, seconded by Councilor Tseng, all those in favor?

871
01:21:03,391 --> 01:21:03,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Opposed?

872
01:21:03,852 --> 01:21:04,613
[SPEAKER_13]: Motion passes.
