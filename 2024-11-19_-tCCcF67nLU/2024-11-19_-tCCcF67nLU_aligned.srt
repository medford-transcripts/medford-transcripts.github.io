1
00:00:00,431 --> 00:00:02,092
of the Medford City Council to order.

2
00:00:03,013 --> 00:00:04,573
Will the city clerk please call the roll.

3
00:00:05,114 --> 00:00:05,714
Councilor Behrs.

4
00:00:05,734 --> 00:00:06,154
Present.

5
00:00:06,995 --> 00:00:07,615
Councilor Falco.

6
00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:08,035
Present.

7
00:00:08,516 --> 00:00:09,076
Councilor Marks.

8
00:00:09,396 --> 00:00:09,636
Present.

9
00:00:09,856 --> 00:00:10,417
Councilor Morrell.

10
00:00:11,017 --> 00:00:11,357
Present.

11
00:00:11,737 --> 00:00:12,438
Councilor Scarpelli.

12
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:12,798
Present.

13
00:00:13,238 --> 00:00:13,818
President Caraballo.

14
00:00:13,858 --> 00:00:15,519
Present.

15
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:16,520
Vice President Nye presiding.

16
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:18,241
Will you all please rise to salute the flag.

17
00:00:19,722 --> 00:00:29,467
I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

18
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,402
Motions, orders, and resolutions.

19
00:00:39,783 --> 00:00:43,548
Paper 21404, offered by President Caraviello.

20
00:00:44,148 --> 00:00:49,395
Be it so resolved, the Medford City Council discuss the report submitted by the traffic engineer in regard to High Street.

21
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:54,282
Be it further resolved, the traffic engineer and the city engineer be available to address this issue.

22
00:00:55,501 --> 00:01:03,828
a council Scott Pelley offered an amendment requesting that the MBTA be contacted for answers and that the MBTA representatives meet with the council and committee of the whole for further discussion.

23
00:01:04,389 --> 00:01:08,572
Be counselor bears off an amendment that the 710 bus be included in discussions at this meeting.

24
00:01:17,303 --> 00:01:19,785
Because they run sort of together.

25
00:01:20,126 --> 00:01:20,946
There are no objections.

26
00:01:21,026 --> 00:01:40,002
Paper 21407, be it so resolved, the Medford City Council go on record as informing the city administration as being opposed to the new island installation of High Street, Rubin Street, and Hastings Lane for it directly affects the public safety of the immediate area residents, bus, truck, and public safety equipment, especially in times of an emergency and extreme inclement weather.

27
00:01:40,723 --> 00:01:56,169
Be it further resolved, the new intersection island at the Woburn Street intersection of High Street exposes the City of Medford to potential lawsuits from any such accidents from the installation, and as such, we, the City Council, respectfully put the City Administration on notice for being opposed for making our city exposed for liability.

28
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:58,370
Thank you, Mr. President.

29
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:03,352
Mr. President, this is something that's been out there for a couple of weeks now that I put on there.

30
00:02:03,845 --> 00:02:10,930
and disregard to the new traffic configuration at the top of High Street, Woobin, and Hastings.

31
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:19,657
I lived on Hastings Lane at the top of the street for 10 years, and I know the safety issues that go up there.

32
00:02:19,977 --> 00:02:23,260
I lived in the house there, and when the trucks came by, my house rattled.

33
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:27,303
And I don't know if anybody's gone by to see the island there.

34
00:02:28,405 --> 00:02:30,769
Not that I'm opposed to having an island somewhere.

35
00:02:31,330 --> 00:02:33,614
That is not a location where that island should be.

36
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:39,263
First of all, it's narrow for trucks to traverse at the time.

37
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,862
Route 60 is a major truck route.

38
00:02:43,662 --> 00:02:47,025
Gasoline tankers go by there all day and night.

39
00:02:47,465 --> 00:02:51,168
Be there at 2, 3 in the morning when those trucks go rolling down there in the dark.

40
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:55,792
They're not going to see that, and someone's going to hit it because there's no light there on either end.

41
00:02:55,812 --> 00:03:04,038
Someone's going to hit it, and they're going to tip over, and you're going to see a fuel spill, similar to what we saw on the Merritt-Arlington line some years back.

42
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:08,205
They spilled 30,000 gallons of fuel into the Mystic River.

43
00:03:08,645 --> 00:03:10,426
And I don't want to see that happen again over there.

44
00:03:10,706 --> 00:03:13,367
So people are saying that I don't care about public safety.

45
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:16,748
The reason I have this here is because I do care about public safety.

46
00:03:16,948 --> 00:03:20,209
And I care about the public safety of the people that live in that neighborhood.

47
00:03:20,409 --> 00:03:21,630
That's my neighborhood where I live.

48
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,651
On Sunday, the island has been hit.

49
00:03:26,675 --> 00:03:29,296
Sunday morning at 9 o'clock in the morning, the island got hit by a car.

50
00:03:29,837 --> 00:03:31,258
It had to be taken out there.

51
00:03:31,558 --> 00:03:32,998
DPOW had to clean up the mess.

52
00:03:33,579 --> 00:03:34,399
And it just started.

53
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,121
It's only been there for three weeks.

54
00:03:39,442 --> 00:03:42,584
The fire chief had the fire trucks get on there, try to make the turn.

55
00:03:43,064 --> 00:03:43,564
He says, yes.

56
00:03:43,604 --> 00:03:45,505
He says the truck was able to make the turn.

57
00:03:45,866 --> 00:03:46,766
He says it was a little thin.

58
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:51,609
He said there was only a foot of space on both sides of the road.

59
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:53,890
What are we going to do in the wintertime

60
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:55,761
when there's snow on the road there.

61
00:03:56,341 --> 00:03:59,764
And the road goes from 10 feet down to 8 feet.

62
00:04:00,264 --> 00:04:03,266
And those trucks, how do they make that turn?

63
00:04:03,647 --> 00:04:09,271
So if you read the traffic engineer's report, he wants you to go into the opposite lane and make the turn.

64
00:04:10,231 --> 00:04:13,394
Talk to the firemen that did the test route.

65
00:04:14,154 --> 00:04:15,855
Why wasn't the chief consultant on this?

66
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:17,657
This is the man that

67
00:04:19,234 --> 00:04:21,777
He's one of our chief safety officers in the city.

68
00:04:22,257 --> 00:04:24,059
He wasn't even consulted on this yet.

69
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:31,368
Again, it's not about the island, but it's the placement of the island.

70
00:04:31,388 --> 00:04:31,528
Listen.

71
00:04:35,144 --> 00:04:35,865
You want to have an island.

72
00:04:35,885 --> 00:04:37,366
The island on Woolman Street is fine.

73
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:40,128
That island on High Street, it's narrow.

74
00:04:40,348 --> 00:04:46,073
Go down to the island by the Brooks School, much wider, and it's not on a turn.

75
00:04:47,034 --> 00:04:50,557
Now, when the trucks are coming up the hill, they have to accelerate to get up there.

76
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:53,039
It's going to be difficult to picture.

77
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:57,143
There's got to be a light, at least, on one side of that in order to break that.

78
00:04:57,203 --> 00:04:59,945
If not, accidents are going to continue to happen.

79
00:05:00,526 --> 00:05:00,726
Listen.

80
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:03,486
The government makes mistakes.

81
00:05:03,526 --> 00:05:05,087
We make mistakes and then we do things wrong.

82
00:05:05,507 --> 00:05:16,231
Let's figure out what we did wrong here and try to fix it and make it right before the city ends up getting sued and before somebody gets hurt on that piece of it.

83
00:05:17,071 --> 00:05:19,792
And it is about public safety.

84
00:05:19,832 --> 00:05:21,332
It's not anything else.

85
00:05:21,432 --> 00:05:22,453
So thank you, Mr. President.

86
00:05:25,454 --> 00:05:26,674
Chair recognizes Councilor Morrell.

87
00:05:28,115 --> 00:05:28,795
Thank you, Mr. President.

88
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,756
Is the traffic engineer on the call?

89
00:05:31,596 --> 00:05:31,876
Do we know?

90
00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:36,225
I can't answer that question because the council president's computer shut off.

91
00:05:36,426 --> 00:05:37,386
I just have questions for them.

92
00:05:37,526 --> 00:05:41,529
So if they're not here, I don't have anything right now.

93
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,401
I do not see the traffic engineer on the call.

94
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:03,681
Nope, sitting in there, the traffic engineer.

95
00:06:04,802 --> 00:06:07,883
Any other councilors have anything they'd like to say?

96
00:06:07,903 --> 00:06:08,423
Councilor Baez.

97
00:06:08,603 --> 00:06:09,484
Thank you, Mr. President.

98
00:06:10,464 --> 00:06:12,485
Thank you, President Caravaglia for putting this forward.

99
00:06:15,066 --> 00:06:20,188
As it stands, you know, it says as being opposed to the new island installation, I'm not opposed to an island.

100
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:27,211
If we could change that to concerns regarding the placement of the new island installation, then I would be more comfortable voting for it.

101
00:06:27,251 --> 00:06:29,592
All right, did you get that, Mr. Clerk?

102
00:06:40,894 --> 00:06:44,936
So you want to amend it to say concerns regarding placement of the new island?

103
00:06:45,216 --> 00:06:49,737
Yeah, so where it says as being opposed to, change that to that we have concerns regarding the placement of.

104
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:59,301
I wouldn't mind seeing it redesigned, but if it's essential, it's, you know.

105
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:05,303
Chair recognizes Councilor Morocco.

106
00:07:05,908 --> 00:07:06,568
Thank you, Mr. President.

107
00:07:06,929 --> 00:07:16,454
I'm curious if we could also request from the city solicitor just if this does, in fact, open us up to liability, if it's up to code, you know, does that open us up to liability?

108
00:07:16,474 --> 00:07:21,457
I mean, I know people can sue for whatever, but are we, in fact, opened up to liability if this meets the code?

109
00:07:22,818 --> 00:07:24,539
Do you offer that as an amendment or as a B paper?

110
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,681
An amendment, if you'll oblige.

111
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:28,902
Thank you.

112
00:07:31,903 --> 00:07:32,564
Chair, wait a second.

113
00:07:33,764 --> 00:07:34,725
Seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

114
00:07:36,162 --> 00:07:39,770
Thank you.

115
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:41,353
Chair recognizes Mr. Penter at the podium.

116
00:07:43,132 --> 00:07:46,976
Good evening, my name is Bob Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of the Sarkis party.

117
00:07:47,496 --> 00:07:49,838
I would respectfully disagree with using the word concern.

118
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:52,881
The fact of the matter is that an accident has already taken place.

119
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:56,164
Tank has already been going down that road and coming up that road.

120
00:07:56,184 --> 00:08:05,272
You have MBTA buses telling you, you have a line from your own traffic consultant that tells you that a fire truck, if has to, can go on the opposite lane.

121
00:08:06,073 --> 00:08:08,996
You have no idea at what time of day or night that that might be happening.

122
00:08:09,436 --> 00:08:22,644
The whole idea, I believe, the impetus of the council president's resolution is to let this city administration know that this council is not supportive of this type of islands coming in here.

123
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:26,886
You can call it part of the complete streets program, the $563,000 that the city got from the commonwealth.

124
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:32,250
Where was the fire chief being consulted on that?

125
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:34,191
Where was the city engineer being consulted?

126
00:08:34,251 --> 00:08:43,058
And all these proposed bump outs that are being planned right now, continuing down on High Street, going into the West Memphis area, where's the consultation for that?

127
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:50,804
Just go look at Sagamore Avenue and see the way they want to have that cutout coming out into the middle of High Street and then Boston Avenue over there.

128
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:56,068
And then further down, right opposite the Brooks School, there's a gentleman who just did his driveway over and he's got a bump out in front of it.

129
00:08:56,308 --> 00:08:57,629
It doesn't make any sense at all.

130
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,911
I would not change one word in the president's resolution, only for one reason.

131
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:07,952
The city administration has to know that you do recognize that this is a safety problem here in the city of Medford.

132
00:09:08,192 --> 00:09:09,493
This isn't just for cars.

133
00:09:09,753 --> 00:09:10,593
This is for trucks.

134
00:09:10,873 --> 00:09:12,033
This is for ambulances.

135
00:09:12,273 --> 00:09:16,294
This is for other kinds of vehicles that are heavy duty going down there.

136
00:09:16,334 --> 00:09:21,255
And we're not talking about a good day, as the council just alluded to on Sunday at 9 o'clock in the morning.

137
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:24,336
The gentleman, unfortunately, didn't see the island.

138
00:09:24,376 --> 00:09:27,897
Not only didn't see the island, he wrecked the whole bottom of the carriage of his car.

139
00:09:28,738 --> 00:09:35,026
What are you going to do in a snowstorm when it's dark out late at night and you have a big heavy tanker going down there?

140
00:09:35,046 --> 00:09:43,557
What are you going to do with a bicycle, a gentleman or a lady driving their bike down there, going in that little lane there, and you have an emergency vehicle trying to get by?

141
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:50,822
You know, one thing I learned after many years of being on this council is one thing.

142
00:09:50,962 --> 00:10:08,627
If you know you see something that's wrong, why would you want to just smooth it over, use the word of concern as relates to telling the city administration, you're going to continue on with this complete streets program, this traffic calming issue, then the public safety is the priority.

143
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:11,287
And right now it's quite obvious that it's not a priority.

144
00:10:11,547 --> 00:10:13,328
Correct me if I'm wrong, Council President,

145
00:10:13,828 --> 00:10:17,757
Fire Chief said, even though he can get by, he's only got a foot on either side.

146
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:18,459
Is that what he said?

147
00:10:20,863 --> 00:10:21,323
to the chair.

148
00:10:22,184 --> 00:10:40,392
The chief said that it was, he said he had about a foot on either side, and on Sunday at the cemetery, I talked to the people who actually drove the test route, and they said it was a little tight, but they have concerns about making that turn in the winter, when the roadway gets narrow.

149
00:10:40,512 --> 00:10:42,073
So that's where the concern is.

150
00:10:42,413 --> 00:10:49,136
And if you look down where the islands by the Brooks School is, you can see how much wider it is there versus the width

151
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:51,843
on the turn.

152
00:10:53,904 --> 00:11:06,852
I would believe that the impetus of the resolution, if you want to get to the concern that Mr. Isaac Beers has introduced, that would be something that they would once again look at to come back, okay, we'll redesign it.

153
00:11:07,652 --> 00:11:17,618
But you'd lose your impact by putting the city on notice that you've recognized, you've talked, this is four times in a month, you have discussed this issue and it's not going away.

154
00:11:19,152 --> 00:11:28,194
And the only way it's going to go away is if the city administration is aware of it and whoever their contact is with the state for the purposes of trying to make this correction, so be it.

155
00:11:28,674 --> 00:11:32,875
As of this Sunday, the fire chief, as of this Sunday, the fire chief still hasn't been informed.

156
00:11:33,175 --> 00:11:35,095
So he had to go out there and do his dry run.

157
00:11:35,555 --> 00:11:37,896
Well, how do you call that progress?

158
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:43,437
How do you call that when somebody is supposed to sit down and let's talk about this traffic calming issue?

159
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:48,198
How can it be traffic calming when you haven't even spoken to the public safety personnel who it's going to affect?

160
00:11:50,559 --> 00:11:56,482
You know, it isn't like you guys, young lady, are in a tough bind.

161
00:11:56,882 --> 00:11:59,704
It's a very simple resolution that the President has offered.

162
00:12:03,225 --> 00:12:12,888
as the mayor of this community and to your departments, we're putting you on notice because God forbid something happens and somebody gets killed, this council has put the city on notice.

163
00:12:13,328 --> 00:12:20,270
If not, God forbid something happens and you modify that resolution, you're all gonna be part of a lawsuit.

164
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,651
And then you're gonna have to explain your way out of it.

165
00:12:23,651 --> 00:12:25,572
That's wrong and that shouldn't happen like that.

166
00:12:27,454 --> 00:12:32,099
I would suggest, Mr. President, that you do not accept the resolution to modify it.

167
00:12:32,939 --> 00:12:33,980
Just make it as a concern.

168
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:34,961
It's not a concern.

169
00:12:35,001 --> 00:12:35,562
It's an issue.

170
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:39,886
It's a public safety issue that demands its attention one way or the other.

171
00:12:40,987 --> 00:12:43,089
And if they don't want to resolve it, shame on them.

172
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:46,152
At least the council's on record explaining the reason why.

173
00:12:46,172 --> 00:12:48,014
Thank you.

174
00:12:48,034 --> 00:12:49,876
Mr. President.

175
00:12:50,837 --> 00:12:52,058
Chair recognizes Councilor Marks.

176
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:10,069
their potential concerns on this area.

177
00:13:10,509 --> 00:13:20,955
We also did hear back from the traffic engineer and the city engineer regarding the design standards and safety standards that meet state and federal guidelines.

178
00:13:21,776 --> 00:13:28,920
And at this point, in my opinion, that intersection of Woburn and High was a free-for-all.

179
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:31,013
a complete free-for-all.

180
00:13:31,834 --> 00:13:34,596
This actually makes a difference, in my opinion.

181
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:40,220
It clearly defines going up or taking a right or a left.

182
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,862
It clearly defines it now, which never existed.

183
00:13:43,663 --> 00:13:52,370
Now, if the issue is whether or not a fire apparatus can get there during snow time and clement weather and so forth, that's an issue that needs to be looked at and addressed.

184
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:56,393
I don't think anyone doubts what former Councilor Pence is stating.

185
00:13:56,873 --> 00:13:58,555
And I'm hoping that's taking place.

186
00:13:59,035 --> 00:14:01,216
because we've addressed this on several occasions.

187
00:14:01,856 --> 00:14:17,844
But by no stretch, Mr. President, do I believe that this area was better off prior to the work that was done, because I do believe that work clearly delineates where you have to go now and where you have to stay and so forth.

188
00:14:17,864 --> 00:14:19,145
Point of information, Councilor Marks.

189
00:14:20,506 --> 00:14:21,806
Point of information, Councilor Kerrio.

190
00:14:21,826 --> 00:14:24,588
The major concern is the width of the roadway.

191
00:14:25,472 --> 00:14:31,295
That's the real concern, where it really narrows down to a very narrow point there.

192
00:14:31,475 --> 00:14:37,017
That's really the big concern that I have, that it needs some more space on both sides of it.

193
00:14:38,158 --> 00:14:42,200
That's the whole crux of this.

194
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,442
Again, if someone's riding a bike and a car down there, they can't fit together.

195
00:14:47,382 --> 00:14:49,924
It needs to be widened a little more at some point there.

196
00:14:50,185 --> 00:14:50,925
Right, right.

197
00:14:51,185 --> 00:14:57,551
And I don't disagree with you, but I'm saying at some point we have to rely on the experts and the professionals.

198
00:14:58,252 --> 00:15:05,138
And if they're telling us that this complies with all safety standards and so forth, I think we have to at least rely on that.

199
00:15:05,158 --> 00:15:07,660
But I don't know if that's fully been vetted out yet.

200
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:15,783
And just because the state came in and did work there, to me, I think it at least, at the very least, requires an additional look.

201
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:20,584
And that's, I think, what we've been asking for the last three or four weeks, for the city to take an additional look.

202
00:15:21,825 --> 00:15:25,906
Asking to take stuff down now and so forth, I don't have the expertise to do that.

203
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:29,368
You know, I don't have the expertise to say take something down.

204
00:15:29,868 --> 00:15:33,232
What I do have is the common sense to say maybe it should be reviewed.

205
00:15:33,832 --> 00:15:40,299
But clearly, these type of initiatives, and I've been talking about them for 20 years, so I can't take a back step on it.

206
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,302
Traffic calming initiatives do work in the community.

207
00:15:44,138 --> 00:15:46,079
And these are traffic calming issues.

208
00:15:46,599 --> 00:15:58,643
We may not like this one in particular or think it doesn't fit in this particular area, but these bump outs, these extending of sidewalks, these definitely make a difference when it comes to slowing traffic down.

209
00:15:58,803 --> 00:16:00,244
It's a known fact.

210
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:01,824
It's not only happening in Memphis.

211
00:16:01,984 --> 00:16:03,205
It's happening all over the state.

212
00:16:03,705 --> 00:16:04,505
across the country.

213
00:16:04,545 --> 00:16:07,846
So I think we have to proceed with caution on this.

214
00:16:08,507 --> 00:16:09,847
I support having it looked at.

215
00:16:10,547 --> 00:16:13,588
You're right, if it is a safety concern, I agree with you.

216
00:16:13,628 --> 00:16:14,368
That's a neighborhood.

217
00:16:14,408 --> 00:16:20,430
And if we're in fear that trucks may have a hard time navigating over there, absolutely.

218
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,311
I think we're obligated to say that.

219
00:16:22,931 --> 00:16:29,776
But I'm not an engineer or a professional to say that we should start redesigning, because I don't know what a redesign would look like.

220
00:16:30,076 --> 00:16:32,297
That's not something that I do.

221
00:16:32,738 --> 00:16:38,321
So I will support the resolution, because I think it makes sense.

222
00:16:38,982 --> 00:16:46,146
But I'm not prepared to say that we have to take a step back and start redesigning things, because that's not in my realm.

223
00:16:47,247 --> 00:16:47,587
Thank you.

224
00:16:48,628 --> 00:16:49,689
Couldn't agree with you more, Councilman Max.

225
00:16:52,736 --> 00:16:54,398
Chair recognizes Jared Powell.

226
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:56,901
Clerk, will the clerk please unmute Jared Powell.

227
00:17:02,173 --> 00:17:03,073
All right, thank you.

228
00:17:03,393 --> 00:17:07,114
This is Jared Powell from 82 Brookings Street in Medford.

229
00:17:07,334 --> 00:17:11,615
I am the current chair of the Medford Bicycle Advisory Commission.

230
00:17:12,355 --> 00:17:17,177
I'm attending tonight largely to speak about the high street thing or provide some comments.

231
00:17:17,197 --> 00:17:22,798
I wanted to first thank Councilor Marks for his comments just now about how,

232
00:17:23,739 --> 00:17:28,565
This should represent a significant improvement to the state of affairs on High Street.

233
00:17:29,186 --> 00:17:30,648
I certainly agree with that.

234
00:17:30,668 --> 00:17:40,260
I myself am not an engineer, though I do believe that this process has been vetted by local and state officials and follows the various guidelines that are appropriate.

235
00:17:41,563 --> 00:17:44,325
I do think that any project could be better.

236
00:17:44,345 --> 00:17:48,909
I don't want to make the perfect the enemy of the good, however.

237
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:53,394
We should bear in mind the pre-existing conditions of this roadway.

238
00:17:54,274 --> 00:18:02,462
They are intense, they are unpleasant for people on foot, for people who are biking, and frankly, for people who are driving as well.

239
00:18:02,522 --> 00:18:04,144
We try to, in the commission, we try to keep

240
00:18:04,904 --> 00:18:08,168
of those interests align and pay attention to the needs of the whole.

241
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:15,558
But I do want to keep in mind that at a high level, this represents a significant improvement for the area.

242
00:18:16,699 --> 00:18:21,465
Any traffic changes, particularly to streets that have been the way they are for a long time,

243
00:18:22,446 --> 00:18:29,273
are probably going to require a little bit of learning and new driver reorientation in particular.

244
00:18:29,293 --> 00:18:42,225
That's certainly going to happen but we do have real problems now on that street with speed and safety and with bad behavior of drivers and frankly a lack of confusion.

245
00:18:42,325 --> 00:18:45,368
You know it's wide and it does create kind of a free fall

246
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:50,082
you know, a free for all situation, as one of the other councilors mentioned.

247
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:53,224
So I do want to thank everyone who's been working on this.

248
00:18:53,444 --> 00:19:10,475
I appreciate people who have been asking the tough questions and making sure that it does conform to all the standards that we want, but I don't want us to lose track of the fact that this is certainly a substantial improvement over the way things have been for a long time.

249
00:19:11,595 --> 00:19:11,896
Thank you.

250
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:15,878
Thank you, Mr. Powell.

251
00:19:19,218 --> 00:19:21,340
share recognizes Mr Penta.

252
00:19:23,281 --> 00:19:24,722
Just in response to Council max.

253
00:19:25,983 --> 00:19:41,615
Nobody's asking anything to be redesigned I don't think any of us have that expertise we're aware of that, but nobody came into the city and sat down with the public safety people, as it relates to all these locations that are being promulgated, and whether a review after four months

254
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:56,891
I mean, after four weeks talking about this and there's still, there is still no communication with the public safety personnel of this city, which means either one or two things, either the city administration is not listening to the council, the city engineers not listening to the council.

255
00:19:57,512 --> 00:20:01,154
And you have a fire chief who's basically telling you, you might have a problem.

256
00:20:01,414 --> 00:20:06,937
You have a city traffic engineer turns around and tells you, well, if something happens, you can go to the opposite side of the street.

257
00:20:07,537 --> 00:20:18,123
Well, that in and of itself tells you right there, don't talk about public safety when you have a fire truck coming at you on the opposite side of the street, if an emergency exists, or if there's a snowstorm or whatever it might be.

258
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:33,119
The whole idea I believe of the impotence of this whole resolution is to put the city on notice that you're not happy with the island there because it is, it has the potential to cause problems and if it's going to cause problems in an accident for which you've already had one it's already started.

259
00:20:33,951 --> 00:20:35,693
You know, keep us out of it.

260
00:20:35,793 --> 00:20:42,781
We should not be part of any lawsuit by any citizen, city of Medford or other city of Medford, because we told you this was going to happen.

261
00:20:43,402 --> 00:20:51,472
Maybe it might be wise, Mr. President, to invite the state in to sit down with the city council and review every one of these locations that they want to put in.

262
00:20:52,032 --> 00:20:53,753
How many accidents have taken place?

263
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:55,514
This is the reason why we're putting it here.

264
00:20:55,774 --> 00:20:58,455
Where the bump boats are going and what's the reason for it?

265
00:20:58,695 --> 00:21:00,036
They made the determination.

266
00:21:00,236 --> 00:21:01,756
They don't live in the city of Medford.

267
00:21:02,016 --> 00:21:04,257
They're not the experts for the city of Medford.

268
00:21:05,118 --> 00:21:15,042
It's our city engineer and our public safety because if it's going to impede anything that they do on a daily basis, they should be primary before any decision is made.

269
00:21:15,623 --> 00:21:16,043
Thank you.

270
00:21:18,524 --> 00:21:18,924
Mr. President.

271
00:21:20,438 --> 00:21:21,279
Want to be made clear.

272
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:22,660
Chair recognizes Councilor Kerrio.

273
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,441
Let me be clear, not opposed to any of the bump outs or anything like that.

274
00:21:25,722 --> 00:21:26,162
They're fine.

275
00:21:26,382 --> 00:21:28,263
I think those are all fine and great.

276
00:21:29,244 --> 00:21:32,226
But I say it's just that it's that width of the island there.

277
00:21:32,246 --> 00:21:34,027
So that's really the only concern that I have.

278
00:21:39,311 --> 00:21:41,072
Councilor Moxley, notice your microphone's on.

279
00:21:41,532 --> 00:21:42,013
You all set?

280
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:43,013
I'm good.

281
00:21:43,294 --> 00:21:45,595
All right.

282
00:21:46,896 --> 00:21:48,097
On the motion by Councilor Kerrio.

283
00:21:49,155 --> 00:21:59,663
seconded by councilor Scott Pelley as amended by councilor Biaza seconded by councilor Scott Pelley as further amended by councilor Morrell as seconded by councilor Scott Pelley.

284
00:22:00,104 --> 00:22:04,447
All those in favor, please say aye.

285
00:22:06,449 --> 00:22:07,470
Wow, that was great.

286
00:22:10,672 --> 00:22:12,133
All those in opposition, please say aye.

287
00:22:13,775 --> 00:22:16,457
Hearing none, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes.

288
00:22:21,205 --> 00:22:24,587
Council paper 21406 offered by Councilor Marks.

289
00:22:24,967 --> 00:22:30,851
Be it resolved that the Medford Chess Club Outdoor Riverside Avenue Park Sunday Club meetings be discussed.

290
00:22:31,571 --> 00:22:37,374
A, Councilor Scott Pelli offered an amendment requesting that the administration ask the Director of Recreation to reach out to this organization.

291
00:22:37,815 --> 00:22:43,758
B, Councilor Falco offered an amendment requesting the DPW look into the water spigots in the park to ensure they're working properly.

292
00:22:44,638 --> 00:22:50,682
C, Councilor Falco offered an amendment requesting the Medford Police Department increase its patrols in the area on Sundays.

293
00:22:51,418 --> 00:22:59,684
D, Vice President Knight offered an amendment requesting that the Recreation Department apply for determination of eligibility from the Community Preservation Committee.

294
00:23:00,985 --> 00:23:01,545
Councilor Marks.

295
00:23:02,606 --> 00:23:03,567
Thank you, Mr. President.

296
00:23:03,987 --> 00:23:20,499
I offered this last week under suspension and therefore under our council rules, it appears the following week, we had many discussions regarding the park on Riverside Ave and the usefulness of having

297
00:23:22,033 --> 00:23:30,117
a chess, actually a statewide chess club, being able to, on Sundays, use that particular area.

298
00:23:30,257 --> 00:23:38,381
And I think, Mr. Vice President, you brought up a great point about that being recognized as a park and may require permitting and so forth.

299
00:23:39,261 --> 00:23:49,386
But at the time, one of the organizers, Chris Donovan, who started this roughly two years ago to attract additional foot traffic to Meffitt Square,

300
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:54,119
came up with the idea, and there's a local Method chess club.

301
00:23:54,779 --> 00:23:58,761
They've been going down there ever since, I believe on weekends.

302
00:23:59,562 --> 00:24:19,632
And it was his thought if, you know, the old field of dreams, if we build it out to suit those who play chess, for instance, Chris sent me a number of pitches, which he sent to our director of Parks and Recreation of Stone

303
00:24:20,032 --> 00:24:22,653
chest tables with chairs that are fixed.

304
00:24:23,074 --> 00:24:24,634
So they're fixed right to the ground.

305
00:24:24,995 --> 00:24:27,476
There's no set up and tear down every time.

306
00:24:27,936 --> 00:24:31,638
It's far easier for community to put on these type of events.

307
00:24:32,418 --> 00:24:45,545
And the, according to Chris Donovan, the city's parks and recreations are currently looking at some fixed tables, chest tables to use that are made out of concrete or steel.

308
00:24:45,965 --> 00:24:48,867
They're looking at shade umbrellas because as we all know,

309
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:59,119
That area is pretty wide open to the sun and is not conducive to people playing chess in the sun for any more than a short period of time.

310
00:24:59,459 --> 00:25:00,500
So they're looking for shade.

311
00:25:00,821 --> 00:25:09,227
They're also looking for, which I believe they just purchased, and I want to thank the city, two foot tall chess pieces that are family friendly.

312
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:18,135
So if you're not that great of a chess player, you can go down there with your family and put around with the giant two foot chess pieces

313
00:25:18,735 --> 00:25:27,278
And there'll be people down there that will show you how to play the game of chess, which I think is a family fun activity for all, Mr. President.

314
00:25:27,538 --> 00:25:37,561
They're looking to have tournaments down there and for eventually that this be one of the recognized stops in Massachusetts for professional chess tournaments.

315
00:25:38,281 --> 00:25:46,023
And it's just one addition to the square, which I think would be much needed for additional foot traffic.

316
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:47,784
I want to thank Chris Donovan.

317
00:25:48,985 --> 00:25:50,406
for his efforts on this.

318
00:25:51,207 --> 00:26:13,679
And I know my council colleagues agree that we believe that this would be a great asset to the square and something that, you know, provide the additional foot traffic to those businesses that have been stuck with this pandemic for the past 15 months and welcome additional people into the square.

319
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:17,201
So I just want to thank Chris again and

320
00:26:18,323 --> 00:26:24,448
I look forward to the city moving forward over the summer with this chess club, Mr. President.

321
00:26:24,488 --> 00:26:24,828
Thank you.

322
00:26:28,791 --> 00:26:29,991
Councilor Marks, thank you very much.

323
00:26:30,772 --> 00:26:32,814
Councilor Falco, the chair recognizes Councilor Falco.

324
00:26:32,934 --> 00:26:33,754
Thank you, Mr. President.

325
00:26:33,774 --> 00:26:39,498
I also want to thank Chris Donovan for doing this.

326
00:26:39,518 --> 00:26:46,003
It's nice to see that space utilized for an event like this, and it's nice to see it utilized on a weekly basis.

327
00:26:46,955 --> 00:26:50,299
you know, that space is there and it's a perfect venue for something like this.

328
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:55,924
I just wanted to, I offered an amendment last week on this too.

329
00:26:57,145 --> 00:27:01,970
Point number C, or point C, I guess, it's to increase the patrols in the area on Sundays.

330
00:27:02,010 --> 00:27:02,991
Could that just be daily?

331
00:27:03,311 --> 00:27:04,632
That was supposed to be daily.

332
00:27:05,894 --> 00:27:10,498
If there's issues at that park, we should make sure that, you know,

333
00:27:11,489 --> 00:27:19,212
that the patrols are increased daily, just to make sure that if there is any type of activity that shouldn't be there, that the police aren't looking into it on a daily basis.

334
00:27:19,252 --> 00:27:21,873
So if I could adjust it to daily, I'd appreciate it.

335
00:27:22,353 --> 00:27:22,554
Thank you.

336
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:24,474
It's certainly not a problem, Councilor Lococo.

337
00:27:24,794 --> 00:27:25,455
Thank you very much.

338
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:35,419
On the motion by Councilor Max, seconded by Councilor Caraviello.

339
00:27:35,459 --> 00:27:36,919
All those in favor say aye.

340
00:27:37,099 --> 00:27:37,220
Aye.

341
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,140
All those opposed.

342
00:27:39,340 --> 00:27:40,681
Hearing none, the motion passes.

343
00:27:42,421 --> 00:27:54,343
Paper 21408 offered by... Paper 21408 withdrawn by Councilor Caravaglio.

344
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,443
Paper 21409 offered by Councilor Morrell.

345
00:27:56,884 --> 00:28:04,085
Be it so revolved that the city council receive an update on the Greenland extension project from our Greenland extension community working group representatives.

346
00:28:04,205 --> 00:28:04,765
Councilor Morrell.

347
00:28:06,005 --> 00:28:06,845
Thank you, Mr. President.

348
00:28:07,245 --> 00:28:10,466
Yeah, the Greenline extension project is very excitingly.

349
00:28:11,382 --> 00:28:13,283
nearing completion in the next several months.

350
00:28:13,323 --> 00:28:17,106
And we haven't had an update in a while from our community representatives.

351
00:28:17,166 --> 00:28:21,830
So if we could just get a brief update from Laurel and Jim, that would be beneficial for residents.

352
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:24,972
I believe they both are, either of them should be on the call right now.

353
00:28:30,376 --> 00:28:31,317
Let's go with Jim first.

354
00:28:31,778 --> 00:28:32,098
Okay.

355
00:28:32,858 --> 00:28:34,940
I will let Clark please unmute Jim Silva.

356
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:45,503
Hi, Jim Silva, 115 Yale Street, the Ball Square, South Medford, GLX representative, community working group.

357
00:28:46,588 --> 00:28:50,510
I just want to give an update on the Ball Square station at this point.

358
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:58,535
First, I want to thank the council for their support in enhancing the name and recognizing the significance in the community.

359
00:28:58,795 --> 00:28:59,496
So thank you.

360
00:29:00,956 --> 00:29:05,079
Our station is 70% complete at Ball Square.

361
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:11,843
The structure is in place from the bridge for the walkway support as well as the elevator is in as well.

362
00:29:13,944 --> 00:29:22,927
As far as the retaining walls and the noise walls are being delayed for a fourth time along the Granville Ave to the bridge itself.

363
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:24,088
So there's a delay there.

364
00:29:24,428 --> 00:29:28,890
The community has been notified of that and aware of the delay.

365
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:35,052
So because of COVID, there has been a number of supply chain issues that have taken place.

366
00:29:35,753 --> 00:29:41,495
So again, this is the fourth delay in that placement of the walls.

367
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:47,780
Any questions?

368
00:29:51,521 --> 00:29:52,042
I can't hear.

369
00:29:52,062 --> 00:29:59,584
If we could move on to Laurel.

370
00:29:59,664 --> 00:30:02,405
If we could move on to Laurel, I mean, Laurel.

371
00:30:02,445 --> 00:30:04,966
Laurel, Laurel Roma, name and address of the record, please.

372
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:09,988
Mr. Clerk, can you unmute Laurel?

373
00:30:13,569 --> 00:30:13,889
Thank you.

374
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:15,350
Laurel Roma, 149 Burgett Avenue.

375
00:30:18,127 --> 00:30:19,469
Um, let's see.

376
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:28,938
So for the Medford Tufts station, well, let me just back up and say overall, the project has about 60% of the track laid for it.

377
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:34,423
So in Medford, you'll have seen the track come through the ball square of South Medford station.

378
00:30:34,884 --> 00:30:38,668
It's not quite all the way through the Medford Tufts University stop yet.

379
00:30:39,829 --> 00:30:41,571
However, they're making progress.

380
00:30:42,413 --> 00:30:47,215
What you also may have seen in the news in last week is that this project will be delayed.

381
00:30:47,895 --> 00:31:05,181
So originally it was supposed to open in December, and we were really excited to give you a six month out update, but it turns out that the GLX constructors will be meeting with MassDOT's Physical Management Control Board on Monday, the 21st, to discuss

382
00:31:07,816 --> 00:31:09,857
how delayed the project actually will be.

383
00:31:10,597 --> 00:31:19,542
It's no surprise that the pandemic has thrown a wrench into a number of things, lives, everything, projects, but especially the Green Line extension.

384
00:31:20,856 --> 00:31:33,247
So while they were lucky to have purchased a majority of materials ahead of time, it's the actual manufacturing of the materials and then getting it to us here in Medford that is on delay.

385
00:31:34,068 --> 00:31:39,272
Those folks that live along the project will notice that the sound walls are not complete.

386
00:31:39,813 --> 00:31:41,454
The sound walls will not be complete now.

387
00:31:41,834 --> 00:31:43,536
They're saying it's a late August.

388
00:31:44,677 --> 00:31:48,280
And that we're really taking most dates as a to be determined date.

389
00:31:50,632 --> 00:32:09,914
As you may remember, the project itself has very strict rules that it has to be finished in December of 2021, or the contractors themselves are not just penalized a per day penalty, but they're forbidden to work on any federal contracts until they complete the project.

390
00:32:11,353 --> 00:32:19,760
I'm assuming that within the MBTA and the contractors, they're trying to find a solution to this issue because clearly we're not the only construction project that is delayed.

391
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:22,622
However, we'll know more on Monday.

392
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:32,770
The rest of the project here at Boston College Avenue or the Medford Tufts stop has been the slowest one to go.

393
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:35,392
We're very far behind most of the line.

394
00:32:36,308 --> 00:32:41,450
If you're interested in seeing what the project will look like, mostly finished, check out Union Square in Somerville.

395
00:32:42,610 --> 00:32:46,172
Also, the Lechmere stop is phenomenal to take a look at.

396
00:32:46,572 --> 00:32:55,755
They've relocated the station quite clearly across the street, away from the old station, and the art is installed on the elevator shafts.

397
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:04,138
Here at Midford and Tufts station, you'll see that two elevator shafts have been installed.

398
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:08,727
Also, the platform has been poured and that is curing now.

399
00:33:09,448 --> 00:33:13,893
The retaining wall is up and you'll see the black wire fence along the back.

400
00:33:16,054 --> 00:33:33,426
The next things that have to happen are the emergency egress path has to be built along to Boston Avenue, and the pedestrian bridge from College Avenue across to Boston Avenue, where the T station is, has finally been placed.

401
00:33:33,766 --> 00:33:34,647
It's not permanent.

402
00:33:34,747 --> 00:33:35,628
It's not situated.

403
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:36,808
It's definitely not open.

404
00:33:38,149 --> 00:33:41,772
There's a number of traffic considerations that people should be aware of in this area.

405
00:33:42,906 --> 00:33:56,411
College Avenue coming up from George Street to Boston Avenue is down to one lane for pedestrians, so you'll have to walk on one side of the street if you want to be a pedestrian and be safe.

406
00:33:56,911 --> 00:34:00,153
It's pretty dangerous right now for cyclists, so everyone should be really aware.

407
00:34:00,653 --> 00:34:08,936
The street has bumped out, sorry, construction has bumped out into the street, so there's no breakdown lane or sidewalk again coming up most of College Avenue.

408
00:34:10,192 --> 00:34:16,997
We make that right turn onto Boston Avenue, heading toward Winthrop and Tamper and Hillside Hardware.

409
00:34:18,158 --> 00:34:22,481
At least half of Boston Avenue is also now constrained and restricted.

410
00:34:22,862 --> 00:34:25,744
So there's no sidewalk access, no bike lane.

411
00:34:26,304 --> 00:34:30,047
So again, cyclists should be very careful as well as pedestrians in that area.

412
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:33,930
The intersection at College and Boston Avenue is also restricted.

413
00:34:34,390 --> 00:34:37,032
So you can't get there from here.

414
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:41,131
cross the intersection in a very specific way.

415
00:34:43,032 --> 00:34:46,254
I think that's about it for this particular station stop.

416
00:34:46,314 --> 00:34:50,417
Again, we'll know more about how delayed the project is on Monday.

417
00:34:52,738 --> 00:34:54,399
Thank you, Laurel.

418
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,120
Senior Councilor Marks.

419
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,721
Thank you, Mr. President.

420
00:34:58,001 --> 00:35:01,983
That was an excellent update and I appreciate it.

421
00:35:02,043 --> 00:35:07,987
My question is, the T will not open unless the sound walls are completed, correct?

422
00:35:10,649 --> 00:35:12,290
Um, well, yes.

423
00:35:13,751 --> 00:35:14,392
Yes.

424
00:35:14,672 --> 00:35:15,272
Okay.

425
00:35:15,412 --> 00:35:17,714
So what's correct?

426
00:35:19,155 --> 00:35:19,635
No, you're right.

427
00:35:19,675 --> 00:35:26,900
They can't access the walls until they have to install all the walls first before the

428
00:35:28,565 --> 00:35:29,965
this particular phase is complete.

429
00:35:30,786 --> 00:35:45,389
So there will be, as far as we've been told, parts of the construction still happening once the trains are running, but most likely not the walls unless that construction is so delayed, but we're assuming not.

430
00:35:46,929 --> 00:35:57,012
So residents that abut the tracks could rest assure more or less that the sound walls, which I know they're going to depend on, will be up when this project is underway.

431
00:35:59,184 --> 00:36:01,686
So that's all that's going to happen.

432
00:36:01,866 --> 00:36:02,527
That's correct.

433
00:36:03,167 --> 00:36:10,313
We've been notifying folks along the right-of-way in those three streets, Granville, Morton, and New Bern as well.

434
00:36:10,733 --> 00:36:11,834
They're well aware of the delay.

435
00:36:11,854 --> 00:36:18,720
They're a little frustrated by the process, but again, because of COVID, the supply chain delay has been in place.

436
00:36:20,001 --> 00:36:25,485
And there's also parts of the wall that are not finished along Breguet and up to Brookings as well.

437
00:36:27,223 --> 00:36:35,543
Okay, and do we have any update on the naming of the station that would be Ball Square South Method Station?

438
00:36:37,047 --> 00:36:42,630
The only update we can tell you is what we have within the budget.

439
00:36:43,511 --> 00:36:44,352
It is in there.

440
00:36:44,532 --> 00:36:51,976
Senator Jalen included that information in the budget for the T budget for 2022, as well as in the house bill.

441
00:36:52,256 --> 00:36:55,618
So both of those bills are going to the governor's office after they come out of committee.

442
00:36:55,919 --> 00:36:57,099
Sometime in July, we'll know.

443
00:36:59,321 --> 00:37:00,041
Would it be helpful?

444
00:37:00,101 --> 00:37:03,163
It took pressure from our state officials, apologies.

445
00:37:03,543 --> 00:37:06,085
It took pressure from the state officials

446
00:37:06,575 --> 00:37:15,563
as well as the city council, as well as both mayors from Medford and Somerville, as well as other representatives in Somerville to actually have the tea.

447
00:37:18,633 --> 00:37:26,138
fall through with our request from 2019 to actually change the, to ensure the name of the Ball Square stations, Ball Square slash South Medford.

448
00:37:27,298 --> 00:37:35,803
We're really emphasizing this here because it's important as we all know for wayfaring and also to clarify that Medford does have two station stops.

449
00:37:37,264 --> 00:37:41,206
It's not just Ball Square Somerville, it's also Medford as well.

450
00:37:41,707 --> 00:37:42,787
So the,

451
00:37:44,145 --> 00:37:59,153
T had released a map that showed Ball Square would only be named Ball Square, and it was only with the pressure from the elected officials did it actually get into the budget, therefore advised the T to change the name to Ball Square Self-Member.

452
00:38:00,974 --> 00:38:01,514
That's great.

453
00:38:01,574 --> 00:38:06,537
That pressure started largely in part because you and Jim shaking the tree.

454
00:38:06,997 --> 00:38:09,119
So that was extremely helpful.

455
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:11,560
I'm glad to hear that it's incorporated in

456
00:38:12,813 --> 00:38:14,053
the budgets at the Statehouse.

457
00:38:15,034 --> 00:38:17,836
Just a last point, Mr. President, I know we've all stated this.

458
00:38:18,577 --> 00:38:28,024
I think Jim and Laurel are probably the longest serving volunteers on a project in this city.

459
00:38:29,205 --> 00:38:32,447
And the amount of hours, the time, the effort

460
00:38:32,793 --> 00:38:36,314
As you can hear, they sound like they're city employees.

461
00:38:36,955 --> 00:38:38,555
They sound like they're the engineers.

462
00:38:39,195 --> 00:38:45,398
It's really remarkable what two volunteers have done in this community, Jim Silver and Wal Ruma.

463
00:38:45,818 --> 00:38:58,082
And we can't say enough thank you, because if they weren't at every meeting and at the table, I think much of this would have gone unnoticed, and many of the improvements we're seeing wouldn't have taken place, Mr. President.

464
00:38:58,482 --> 00:39:00,703
If they weren't actively out there,

465
00:39:01,266 --> 00:39:04,809
and looking out for the best interest of our residents and our community.

466
00:39:04,849 --> 00:39:12,775
So on behalf of the council, I want to personally thank them both for their extended service on this committee, Mr. President.

467
00:39:12,855 --> 00:39:13,175
Thank you.

468
00:39:13,675 --> 00:39:14,656
Thank you, Councilor Marks.

469
00:39:14,676 --> 00:39:15,197
Councilor Best.

470
00:39:15,397 --> 00:39:16,377
Thank you, Mr. President.

471
00:39:16,958 --> 00:39:23,142
I just want to echo Councilor Marks, Councilor Morrell, and thanking you, Jim and Laurel, for your service.

472
00:39:23,403 --> 00:39:29,207
I think it's really exciting news for South Medford that that name change will be in the budget, both the House and the Senate.

473
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:31,693
which is just great news, so thank you again.

474
00:39:32,633 --> 00:39:34,133
Thank you, any further comment?

475
00:39:36,174 --> 00:39:41,495
And again, I'm personally, Jim Amaro, thank you very much for all you do for us, thank you again.

476
00:39:41,595 --> 00:39:44,036
On the motion by Councilor Morrell, seconded by?

477
00:39:44,056 --> 00:39:46,897
Seconded by Councilor Falco, all in favor?

478
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:47,797
Aye.

479
00:39:48,197 --> 00:39:49,058
Motion passes.

480
00:39:49,078 --> 00:39:56,780
2-1, 4-1-0 offered by Vice President Knight and Councilor Falco, where is?

481
00:39:57,297 --> 00:40:08,165
The privately owned and operated housing development located at 99 Riverside Avenue provides 200 affordable housing units to senior citizens and disabled Methodist residents.

482
00:40:08,225 --> 00:40:14,870
And whereas the operations of 99 Riverside Avenue are not regulated by the Methodist Housing Authority.

483
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:25,218
And whereas between June 5th and June 9th, outdoor temperatures exceeded 90 degrees, yet the air conditioning in the building was not activated by the manager.

484
00:40:26,122 --> 00:40:50,130
Be it so resolved that the Memphis City Council authorize the city clerk to forward correspondence to the management company of 99 Riverside Avenue, requesting an explanation and citing council concern regarding public health, safety risks associated with senior citizens and disabled persons being preventably subjected to excessive exposure to extreme heat.

485
00:40:51,731 --> 00:40:52,511
Vice President Knight.

486
00:40:55,132 --> 00:40:55,652
Councilor Bacow.

487
00:40:56,258 --> 00:40:57,018
Thank you, Mr. President.

488
00:40:57,058 --> 00:40:58,479
Thank you, Vice President Knight.

489
00:40:59,299 --> 00:41:10,383
Received numerous calls regarding this issue and would like to receive a response from the management company with an explanation, basically an explanation of what happened and a timeline as well.

490
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:13,724
This is a very dangerous situation.

491
00:41:13,764 --> 00:41:20,346
As we know, there are many seniors that lived in that building and many people were negatively impacted by the excessive heat.

492
00:41:21,026 --> 00:41:23,387
And we wanna make sure of course that this is,

493
00:41:24,543 --> 00:41:26,524
you know, prevent it and it doesn't happen again.

494
00:41:26,544 --> 00:41:34,068
So I just want to get an update from the management company to actually find out exactly what happened.

495
00:41:34,289 --> 00:41:37,330
So if we could do that, I'd greatly appreciate it.

496
00:41:37,731 --> 00:41:47,396
And also we can also get a, actually if we can amend it to see what measures we're taking from the board of health with regard to the residents.

497
00:41:47,436 --> 00:41:50,538
I know that cooling stations, I believe were opened, but I believe it was opened

498
00:41:51,273 --> 00:41:52,893
They were open on the Monday after this.

499
00:41:53,533 --> 00:41:56,934
And if this happened on a Friday, why was there a delay?

500
00:41:57,114 --> 00:42:00,875
The city should have stepped in to make sure that our residents are safe.

501
00:42:01,215 --> 00:42:04,996
And cooling stations are great, but they need to be open.

502
00:42:05,536 --> 00:42:08,537
And they need to be open at hours when people need them as well.

503
00:42:08,717 --> 00:42:13,658
And in some instances, an instance like this, this was a really serious situation.

504
00:42:13,678 --> 00:42:15,898
It's a situation that's probably 24-7.

505
00:42:15,918 --> 00:42:17,859
Some people can't live in that excessive heat.

506
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:24,383
So I would like to amend that to get more information from the airport to help.

507
00:42:24,463 --> 00:42:24,724
Thank you.

508
00:42:25,004 --> 00:42:25,685
Thank you, Mr. President.

509
00:42:25,825 --> 00:42:26,706
Vice President Knight.

510
00:42:26,726 --> 00:42:28,008
Mr. President, thank you very much.

511
00:42:28,088 --> 00:42:30,932
And I thank you, Councilor Falco, for partnering with me on this resolution.

512
00:42:31,613 --> 00:42:37,696
When we think about the dangers, this is really a public safety and a public health issue, Mr. President.

513
00:42:37,956 --> 00:42:51,362
200 residents, 200 of our most vulnerable residents in this community, senior citizens and disabled on fixed incomes living in public housing, who are afforded an amenity, an amenity of air conditioning that the management company is not turning on during a heat wave.

514
00:42:52,367 --> 00:42:53,368
It creates a concern.

515
00:42:53,408 --> 00:43:03,196
You know, when you go in that building and we've all been in there campaigning, we've all been in there dropping off flyers and shaking hands and meeting people, you see the population that lives in that building, Mr. President.

516
00:43:03,537 --> 00:43:09,001
You know, you see the ride pulling up in front and taking people to doctor's appointments.

517
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:14,726
You see greater Lansing services pulling up and taking people to doctor's appointments, Mr. President.

518
00:43:14,746 --> 00:43:19,390
So when you look at the population that's serviced there and you look at the action or lack thereof,

519
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:27,043
of our border health and ensuring that these residents are going to be provided with the amenities that are necessary and outlined in the HUD contract.

520
00:43:27,083 --> 00:43:29,624
I think that that's very troubling, Mr. President.

521
00:43:29,704 --> 00:43:31,305
And I thank Councilor Caviello.

522
00:43:31,425 --> 00:43:35,227
I thank Councilor Farquhar again for partnering with me on this agenda item.

523
00:43:35,287 --> 00:43:49,173
And I hope that my council colleagues will support it and move forward and get some questions answered, Mr. President, because ultimately it's a head scratcher to me as to why we know that the air conditioning isn't going to be online, the cooling stations aren't open for the senior citizens that are directly across the street.

524
00:43:49,902 --> 00:43:53,003
So with that being said, I asked my council colleagues for the support of this resolution.

525
00:43:54,083 --> 00:43:54,783
Any further questions?

526
00:43:55,964 --> 00:43:56,484
Councilor Scarpelli.

527
00:43:56,504 --> 00:44:02,505
I think this is something that needs a little more teeth.

528
00:44:04,966 --> 00:44:05,266
Thank you.

529
00:44:05,286 --> 00:44:11,848
I think this needs a little more teeth than just an explanation from the management company.

530
00:44:12,328 --> 00:44:19,210
I think this is where our state administration has to take a lead, whether it's with the Board of Health, the building code, the building department, or

531
00:44:19,902 --> 00:44:22,143
code enforcement or the city solicitor.

532
00:44:22,583 --> 00:44:49,091
So I'd like to make an amendment that I think that not only through, from what I heard is that there are certain a timeline when these certain buildings, and I think that all our assisted living buildings should have some sort of protection with the city administration, whether which department to be, but my amendment would be that they would look at not just the heat, but excessive cold, that there are certain timelines when they,

533
00:44:49,605 --> 00:44:53,388
they look to turn these air conditioners or the heating systems on.

534
00:44:53,828 --> 00:45:02,054
But as you can see in New England weather and what we're seeing in different, we'll have days of 35 degrees one day, another day we'll have 90 degrees.

535
00:45:02,474 --> 00:45:14,623
So I think we have to have a way or we have to have an assistance here in the city of Medford where our city administration involved working with these assisted living homes where we're protecting our residents.

536
00:45:14,723 --> 00:45:17,985
And I think that from what I gathered, it was probably the most terrific

537
00:45:19,689 --> 00:45:23,991
situation where you're stuck on the fifth floor and there's no heat.

538
00:45:24,511 --> 00:45:26,792
I mean, there's no air conditioning that it was oppressive.

539
00:45:26,872 --> 00:45:29,353
So, which is dangerous for our residents.

540
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:48,842
So I appreciate Councilor Falcone, Councilor Knight bringing this forward, but I think we need to make, I'd like to amend this at the city administration and city solicitor's office, whether it be the code enforcement officer or the health department, that we implement a regulation that when,

541
00:45:49,295 --> 00:46:00,123
cases of certain heat or cold, that we make sure that by code or by law, by ordinance, that we're taking steps to make sure we're protecting our residents.

542
00:46:00,163 --> 00:46:02,365
Thank you.

543
00:46:03,286 --> 00:46:04,186
Thank you, Mr. President.

544
00:46:04,227 --> 00:46:13,033
If I may add to Councilor Scarpelli's point, I believe the private management company had said the state law says we have to give them heat till June 15th.

545
00:46:13,213 --> 00:46:15,095
So we couldn't turn on the air conditioning.

546
00:46:15,695 --> 00:46:16,276
I think maybe

547
00:46:17,493 --> 00:46:26,115
I think we've heard before from this administration that they've advocated with the state to change rules that they felt were affecting safety when it came to nursing homes and COVID.

548
00:46:26,175 --> 00:46:35,078
I think as part of Councilor Scarpelli's amendment, they should go to the state and say, why is this based on the arbitrary June 15th and not based on the temperature at the time?

549
00:46:35,198 --> 00:46:43,700
You should be able to have air conditioning when it's 90 degrees or heat when it's 30 degrees, whether it's June 12th or December 12th, it doesn't matter.

550
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,981
So I think that should be a part

551
00:46:46,522 --> 00:46:56,249
of this as well, is that the administration should go to the state and say, if it's not a local ordinance question and it's a state law, that law needs to be adjusted so that we're not in this situation.

552
00:46:56,289 --> 00:46:59,731
Because I believe the problem ended up being fixed on a Tuesday.

553
00:47:00,412 --> 00:47:04,375
That was four or five days of 90 degree heat until the problem was fixed.

554
00:47:04,515 --> 00:47:07,557
So it needs to be done in a much more timely manner going forward.

555
00:47:07,877 --> 00:47:08,217
Thank you.

556
00:47:08,618 --> 00:47:11,039
Thank you, Mr. President.

557
00:47:11,059 --> 00:47:14,762
I want to thank Vice President Knight and Councilor Falco for bringing this forward, as well as my

558
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:21,829
fellow counselors for their amendments and particularly Councilor Scarpelli for really raising the issue of volatility in the weather.

559
00:47:22,429 --> 00:47:29,633
You know, one thing with climate change, we know we're going to have these more volatile patterns and also we're going to have an increase in above 90 degree days.

560
00:47:30,297 --> 00:47:31,518
than we historically have had.

561
00:47:31,578 --> 00:47:42,303
So I think as mentioned also by Councilor Behrs, these arbitrary timelines or dates are really putting people in danger and not serving the people that I think perhaps they were originally designed to protect.

562
00:47:42,904 --> 00:47:49,147
So I support the council action on this and really appreciate the efforts to make sure we're protecting our residents.

563
00:47:50,768 --> 00:47:52,549
Thank you, Councilor Morrell.

564
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:53,389
Seeing Councilor Baxton.

565
00:47:54,550 --> 00:47:55,590
Thank you, Mr. President.

566
00:47:55,751 --> 00:47:57,832
And I wanna thank again Councilor

567
00:47:58,845 --> 00:48:00,286
Falco and Vice President Knight.

568
00:48:02,026 --> 00:48:04,747
This is common every year.

569
00:48:05,247 --> 00:48:06,368
We go through this every year.

570
00:48:07,848 --> 00:48:21,033
Some years we're lucky because we don't have a heat wave until well after the middle of June, but this year we faced a heat wave at the beginning of June, an extended heat wave.

571
00:48:21,954 --> 00:48:28,136
The issue to me is that whether it's a management company or whether it's Method Housing,

572
00:48:28,993 --> 00:48:39,001
If a temperature rises above a certain degree, Mr. President, and from what I read in the paper, that some of these units were upwards of 85 to 90 degrees.

573
00:48:40,041 --> 00:48:55,073
You can imagine being in a unit, 85 or 90 degrees, when you open a window and get zero breeze, Mr. President, or you put on a fan and all you're doing is blowing around the 90 degree heat in a unit, that creates heat exhaustion.

574
00:48:55,545 --> 00:49:03,530
And if you have comorbidities, like many seniors do, and disabled in our community, that could be a very serious combination.

575
00:49:04,071 --> 00:49:05,832
Very serious combination.

576
00:49:06,392 --> 00:49:14,998
And at the very least, Mr. President, and Councilor Farquhar will hit the nail on the head, the city was slow to operate the cooling stations.

577
00:49:15,058 --> 00:49:17,780
It was two days into the heat wave.

578
00:49:18,545 --> 00:49:24,690
that the city sent out a call saying there was the availability of cooling stations.

579
00:49:25,350 --> 00:49:33,277
Also, some of the cooling stations, as Councilor Falco alluded to, had hours that were, you know, bankers hours.

580
00:49:33,917 --> 00:49:40,883
So I guess you can't overheat at nine o'clock at night if it's 90 degrees, and you have nowhere to go, Mr. President.

581
00:49:41,403 --> 00:49:47,128
But at the very least, Mr. President, these particular buildings should be equipped

582
00:49:47,888 --> 00:49:56,714
like emergency management should be in this community, which I have to say, emergency management in this community does not exist.

583
00:49:57,695 --> 00:49:58,756
It's non-existent.

584
00:49:59,136 --> 00:50:06,201
So if we depend on emergency management during a true emergency, we're in trouble in this community.

585
00:50:06,621 --> 00:50:08,463
We can't even attend to one building.

586
00:50:10,464 --> 00:50:17,569
What should have happened is portable AC units should have been immediately deployed in that particular building.

587
00:50:18,788 --> 00:50:19,408
immediately.

588
00:50:19,969 --> 00:50:21,470
Every room should have been checked.

589
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:24,511
Every room should have been checked.

590
00:50:26,652 --> 00:50:37,839
And if we weren't able to get the portable AC systems, they should have contacted the hotel across the street or the hotels in Wellington and put people up for the night or two nights.

591
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:40,640
What's more important?

592
00:50:43,562 --> 00:50:47,404
It was totally mishandled, Mr. President, and it's unacceptable.

593
00:50:48,509 --> 00:50:50,332
and we're not prepared as a community.

594
00:50:51,794 --> 00:50:56,460
This is a shot across the bow for this administration and previous administrations.

595
00:50:59,191 --> 00:51:00,912
because it's a show of a program.

596
00:51:01,112 --> 00:51:17,639
When we go through our budget, and when the council sees a budget for $450 for a city of 58,000 people, Mr. President, you're going to say, what type of emergency management are you going to provide to us, to the seniors, to families?

597
00:51:17,939 --> 00:51:21,221
God forbid a true emergency would happen in this community.

598
00:51:23,261 --> 00:51:26,663
The way they address the pandemic, we hear all sorts of accolades.

599
00:51:28,665 --> 00:51:34,946
That should also be the way we address a situation like we had last week, Mr. President, with the heat wave.

600
00:51:35,447 --> 00:51:39,447
That should kick into effect with the Board of Health and emergency management.

601
00:51:42,188 --> 00:51:44,208
Did we hear about any emergency management?

602
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:48,909
Did the residents hear about any emergency management?

603
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:52,450
No, they had to wait for a newspaper to write an article.

604
00:51:54,351 --> 00:51:55,811
It's unacceptable, Mr. President.

605
00:51:56,175 --> 00:51:56,795
It really is.

606
00:51:57,075 --> 00:51:58,415
And this has been going on for years.

607
00:51:58,716 --> 00:52:00,196
It's not just this administration.

608
00:52:00,936 --> 00:52:05,857
When are we going to get serious with emergency management in this community?

609
00:52:06,917 --> 00:52:09,398
When are we going to have someone head emergency management?

610
00:52:09,738 --> 00:52:11,278
When are we going to fully fund it?

611
00:52:12,919 --> 00:52:14,119
It hasn't happened to date.

612
00:52:14,859 --> 00:52:16,599
And this budget is no different.

613
00:52:17,559 --> 00:52:24,561
Last year, apparently we had the perfect budget and we got accolades for having the perfect budget and mechanically,

614
00:52:25,034 --> 00:52:26,456
Maybe it was the perfect budget.

615
00:52:26,496 --> 00:52:30,020
Maybe it was written up and it looked great and had a great cover on it.

616
00:52:31,382 --> 00:52:34,486
But it's the substance that matters, what's inside the budget.

617
00:52:34,786 --> 00:52:37,950
And we sorely underfund emergency management.

618
00:52:38,171 --> 00:52:39,292
No one wants to talk about it.

619
00:52:40,153 --> 00:52:41,435
We sorely underfund it.

620
00:52:41,675 --> 00:52:43,137
And when it comes up, Mr. President,

621
00:52:43,988 --> 00:52:53,196
I'm going to be the first to shake the tree once again and find out why we're not fully funding emergency management, why we don't have a full time dedicated person.

622
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:58,281
This is not something you give someone a $500 stipend and say, Hey, here's your hat.

623
00:52:58,501 --> 00:53:01,103
You're in charge of emergency management for the city.

624
00:53:02,344 --> 00:53:03,645
There's grant funding out there.

625
00:53:03,665 --> 00:53:09,070
We're not taking advantage of this programs out there that we could take advantage of.

626
00:53:10,570 --> 00:53:15,573
There's companies that will come in and provide services at very little to no cost.

627
00:53:16,374 --> 00:53:17,395
But you have to ask.

628
00:53:17,615 --> 00:53:19,036
You have to have someone in charge.

629
00:53:20,537 --> 00:53:23,179
And it's not happening in this community, Mr. President.

630
00:53:23,379 --> 00:53:23,759
Thank you.

631
00:53:23,939 --> 00:53:25,560
And I thank my colleagues for bringing this up.

632
00:53:25,941 --> 00:53:26,301
Thank you.

633
00:53:29,083 --> 00:53:30,824
Mary Ann Broxton has your hand up.

634
00:53:31,384 --> 00:53:32,265
Mr. Clerk, are you in?

635
00:53:32,465 --> 00:53:32,946
Mary Ann?

636
00:53:36,548 --> 00:53:37,389
Hi, thank you.

637
00:53:37,409 --> 00:53:39,270
Mary Ann, name and address of the record, please.

638
00:53:39,767 --> 00:53:47,812
Maryam rocks in exchange of, and I appreciate your, um, the topic of emergency management and just, I would just like to add to that.

639
00:53:47,872 --> 00:53:52,996
If we're talking about emergency management, we should also have an emergency room in the city.

640
00:53:53,016 --> 00:53:56,498
A hospital that has a functioning emergency room.

641
00:53:57,359 --> 00:54:03,283
As if the people that were at 99, the elderly residents that were there at the apartment building, they got heat stroke.

642
00:54:03,803 --> 00:54:05,984
What emergency room would they have been taken to?

643
00:54:06,385 --> 00:54:08,166
We don't have an operating hospital.

644
00:54:08,961 --> 00:54:11,923
with a hospital with an operating emergency room in the city.

645
00:54:12,444 --> 00:54:16,627
That should be something else we talk about when we talk about emergency management and heat.

646
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:18,148
So that's it.

647
00:54:19,249 --> 00:54:20,010
That's my statement.

648
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:24,814
The council pushed to save that emergency room and it was out of our control, Mr. President.

649
00:54:24,834 --> 00:54:27,536
This council didn't support saving that emergency room.

650
00:54:27,556 --> 00:54:28,196
You are correct.

651
00:54:28,657 --> 00:54:30,158
Is there a way that we can bring one back?

652
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:33,621
I would tend to doubt it.

653
00:54:35,602 --> 00:54:37,324
You can't have an emergency room without a hospital.

654
00:54:38,458 --> 00:54:47,125
So unfortunately the hospital's gone and to have an emergency room that can't provide services would be a detriment to the safety of the public.

655
00:54:49,147 --> 00:55:02,197
So on the motion by Vice President Knight and Councilor Falco as amended by Councilor Falco and Councilor Scott Felly, seconded by Councilor Meares.

656
00:55:02,698 --> 00:55:07,281
I didn't put mine in the form of a motion, but I'd like to put mine in the form of a motion regarding

657
00:55:08,367 --> 00:55:14,390
the budget and the lack of funding in this community for emergency preparedness.

658
00:55:15,371 --> 00:55:17,752
I'd like to get a response back from the city administration.

659
00:55:17,812 --> 00:55:24,556
How they're going to increase the emergency preparedness and awareness in this community.

660
00:55:24,976 --> 00:55:35,622
And also that if this ever happens again in this community, that portable air conditioning units, as well as putting people up in hotels, Mr. President, and public housing.

661
00:55:36,372 --> 00:55:38,433
or in private, Mr. President.

662
00:55:38,773 --> 00:55:45,575
They're making money hand over fist in these private buildings, and they should take care of their residents.

663
00:55:46,135 --> 00:55:48,935
So I would ask that that be part of the report as well.

664
00:55:48,995 --> 00:55:49,956
Thank you.

665
00:55:50,036 --> 00:55:58,818
On the motion by Vice President Knight, Councilor Belco, second as, that's a B paper.

666
00:55:58,878 --> 00:56:05,740
So on the B paper, as offered by Councilor Locke, seconded by Vice President Knight,

667
00:56:06,482 --> 00:56:07,242
All those in favor?

668
00:56:07,582 --> 00:56:07,782
Aye.

669
00:56:08,022 --> 00:56:08,803
Motion passes.

670
00:56:09,303 --> 00:56:17,305
On the original motion offered by Vice President Knight and Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Scott Kelly and Councilor Falco, seconded by?

671
00:56:18,005 --> 00:56:18,345
Second.

672
00:56:18,725 --> 00:56:22,826
Seconded by Councilor Marks.

673
00:56:23,946 --> 00:56:26,147
I'm sorry, Councilor Baez, I'm sorry.

674
00:56:26,647 --> 00:56:27,527
All those in favor?

675
00:56:32,648 --> 00:56:32,848
Yes.

676
00:56:33,649 --> 00:56:35,009
Mr. Clerk, would you make that spot there?

677
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:39,141
Company was blaming the state rule on June 15th.

678
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:41,921
That's fine.

679
00:56:42,962 --> 00:56:45,042
Just to include the look at state law.

680
00:56:45,082 --> 00:56:45,242
Yeah.

681
00:56:45,282 --> 00:56:47,283
Yeah.

682
00:56:47,483 --> 00:56:48,563
Oh, all those in favor.

683
00:56:49,143 --> 00:56:49,283
Aye.

684
00:56:49,403 --> 00:56:50,143
Motion passes.

685
00:56:50,163 --> 00:57:05,107
2-1-4-1-1 offered by Councilor Scott Pelli, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council express its sincere condolences to the family of former athletic director, teacher, coach, and Method legend, Francis Bud Kelly, on his recent passing.

686
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:06,500
Dr. Scarpelli.

687
00:57:07,281 --> 00:57:08,121
Thank you, Mr. President.

688
00:57:09,762 --> 00:57:22,670
When I heard this news Friday morning, it was probably one of the toughest days because Buddy Kelly's played such a positive impact in my life and thousands of other residents here in the city of Method and outside.

689
00:57:24,471 --> 00:57:31,915
First to his family, his wife, Judy, who stood beside him through two bouts of cancer.

690
00:57:32,578 --> 00:57:35,919
and the most awful fifth stage of Parkinson's disease.

691
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:44,082
And his loving children, Beth, Judy, and Linda, who were there every step of the way for their dad.

692
00:57:45,662 --> 00:57:56,166
From what I hear, the last few months spent every single evening with him, making sure mom had the assistance that buddy's independence required.

693
00:57:58,747 --> 00:58:02,208
When I say this, I say this too often, maybe it starts to sound a little corny,

694
00:58:03,085 --> 00:58:06,707
This is happening too often when legends are leaving us here in Metro.

695
00:58:07,568 --> 00:58:14,912
And I thought of Buddy the other day and yesterday when we see our city going through a pretty tough time and it's so divided.

696
00:58:15,712 --> 00:58:28,120
And Buddy would be the type of person, no matter what race or gender, sexual orientation, what religion, your height, your color hair, or if you had no hair.

697
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:30,101
He's the type of person that

698
00:58:31,165 --> 00:58:33,386
would find that bond to bring everybody together.

699
00:58:34,226 --> 00:58:37,447
And that's what I think we miss here right now in this community.

700
00:58:38,687 --> 00:58:48,150
And what I'm talking about is if you grew up in Medford and if you didn't grow up in Medford, you should learn about this because Buddy taught me some important lessons in life.

701
00:58:48,770 --> 00:58:52,971
I learned them in my home about loyalty and commitment and pride.

702
00:58:53,691 --> 00:58:54,491
And that's in your home.

703
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:57,232
That's instilled in you by your mom and dad and your family, you hope.

704
00:58:57,992 --> 00:58:59,833
But Buddy taught you outside the home

705
00:59:00,955 --> 00:59:09,760
is what it all meant to be in Medford Mustang and be, and as he would say, blue and white, blue and white.

706
00:59:11,321 --> 00:59:14,623
And how that blue and white flow through your veins, no matter who you were.

707
00:59:14,643 --> 00:59:28,192
And it was funny as I read posts and talked to alumni and, you know, Krista McCormick, a legendary basketball player, captain of UMaine when I played professionally, she called us and she sent the message and said,

708
00:59:29,336 --> 00:59:37,183
But he was so amazing that he was the person back in the day that said to the girls' basketball program, to the boys' basketball program, hold on a second.

709
00:59:38,164 --> 00:59:39,485
The boys don't get the glass.

710
00:59:40,306 --> 00:59:44,229
The girls can shoot on that same glass the day before game day.

711
00:59:44,249 --> 00:59:45,570
So he changed the rule.

712
00:59:47,712 --> 00:59:51,435
And he made sure that everybody felt comfortable in Memphis High School.

713
00:59:51,455 --> 00:59:55,559
He had his own way, but his way was the Mustang way.

714
00:59:55,719 --> 00:59:56,880
He brought everybody together.

715
00:59:59,322 --> 01:00:07,928
And I'm going to miss him greatly because he did instill in me as a young coach and a young man what it was and why we live in the city of Medford.

716
01:00:08,449 --> 01:00:14,833
Because truly, whether you're here a day or whether you're here for 35 years, you're here for a reason.

717
01:00:15,133 --> 01:00:16,134
You moved here for a reason.

718
01:00:16,754 --> 01:00:19,897
You're brought here for a reason because you love the city of Medford.

719
01:00:21,558 --> 01:00:28,583
And if we can get back to what Buddy taught us for so many years and taught so many people that

720
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:31,853
let the blue and white overcome everything else.

721
01:00:33,753 --> 01:00:35,393
And you could see amazing things happen.

722
01:00:37,874 --> 01:00:42,155
Like I said, last couple of nights, I've been thinking about buddy and seeing what our city is going through.

723
01:00:42,715 --> 01:00:45,896
And that analogy just came to me because it really meant a lot to me.

724
01:00:46,136 --> 01:00:49,637
That's the type of person that brought me into coaching.

725
01:00:49,697 --> 01:00:56,779
That's the type of person that when you sit in a locker room with my teams, that it wasn't about the win or the loss.

726
01:00:57,279 --> 01:00:58,299
It was about being a Mustang.

727
01:00:58,912 --> 01:01:01,133
and loving the blue and white and loving the city.

728
01:01:02,253 --> 01:01:04,094
And somewhere along the line, we forgot that.

729
01:01:05,494 --> 01:01:10,636
And I'd be remiss to say that if it wasn't for Buddy Kelly, I don't know if my life would ever be the same.

730
01:01:11,437 --> 01:01:15,778
He taught me so much and I'm gonna miss him forever.

731
01:01:16,718 --> 01:01:17,099
Thank you.

732
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:18,239
Councilor Besser.

733
01:01:19,940 --> 01:01:21,160
Thank you, Mr. President.

734
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:26,042
I certainly couldn't say anything better than what Councilor Scarpelli just said.

735
01:01:28,001 --> 01:01:33,244
Send my condolences to you, Councilor Scarpelli, and also to Bud Kelly's family.

736
01:01:33,925 --> 01:01:38,988
My sister and I went to Medford Public Schools with Haley and Kelly Carr.

737
01:01:40,109 --> 01:01:41,149
Bud was their grandfather.

738
01:01:41,229 --> 01:01:48,454
So just send my condolences to the whole family on this loss of a great Medford resident.

739
01:01:49,475 --> 01:01:50,255
Thank you, Councilor Villescaz.

740
01:01:50,335 --> 01:01:50,956
Vice President Knight.

741
01:01:52,196 --> 01:01:53,417
Mr. President, thank you very much.

742
01:01:54,298 --> 01:01:57,860
I can't remember a time in my life that Bud Kelly wasn't a part of it.

743
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:01,182
uh, his nephew, David and I were best buddies.

744
01:02:01,222 --> 01:02:02,903
We met the first day of school in first grade.

745
01:02:03,563 --> 01:02:10,508
And, um, throughout high school, I had the opportunity to work in buddy Kelly's office at this great thing meant that I had, it was called office assignments.

746
01:02:11,308 --> 01:02:18,713
And, um, every fifth and sixth period for my junior and senior year, I spent that in Mr. Kelly's office, uh, working with him, putting together the athletic schedules.

747
01:02:19,534 --> 01:02:19,934
Not really.

748
01:02:20,426 --> 01:02:26,907
Um, it was more or less collecting equipment and making sure it was clean and, uh, you know, counting jock straps and shoulder pads.

749
01:02:27,027 --> 01:02:32,469
So it was really what we did, but, um, but it was a great guy and, um, I wouldn't have gotten through high school if it weren't for buddy.

750
01:02:33,249 --> 01:02:40,990
Um, I played lacrosse at Medford high and, uh, throughout my four years at Medford high, we had four different coaches and every year they tried to eliminate the program.

751
01:02:41,630 --> 01:02:46,611
And, um, I'd always go into buddy's office and I. Begging plead for him not to eliminate the program.

752
01:02:46,652 --> 01:02:48,792
So it'll be a keep lacrosse program alive for another year.

753
01:02:49,386 --> 01:02:51,787
And, you know, we still have that program today.

754
01:02:51,827 --> 01:02:52,928
And it was because of Buddy.

755
01:02:53,408 --> 01:02:55,249
Buddy, listen, listen to the kids.

756
01:02:56,310 --> 01:02:58,150
Tried to provide a service, but he was a great man.

757
01:02:58,291 --> 01:03:03,613
He was a great coach, Baldwin Catholic High School, Hall of Famer, Manfred High School, Hall of Famer.

758
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:10,417
Someone who always spoke about the blue and white, but it was always a little secret that he kept that he was actually a Baldwin Catholic graduate.

759
01:03:10,897 --> 01:03:14,459
You know, his sister, Patricia and Brenna Deck, the twins,

760
01:03:15,326 --> 01:03:16,486
very close friends of the family.

761
01:03:16,526 --> 01:03:18,867
And I just want to offer them my condolences.

762
01:03:18,967 --> 01:03:22,068
It was a very tough, tough way to go this evening.

763
01:03:22,248 --> 01:03:29,009
And I stand by my council colleagues and in all the time words that they have about Mr. Kelly, because every single one of them is true.

764
01:03:30,049 --> 01:03:31,190
Thank you, Mr. President.

765
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:31,970
Senior Councilor Marks.

766
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:33,730
Thank you, Mr. President.

767
01:03:33,750 --> 01:03:41,252
I want to thank Councilor Scott Pelly for his putting this on the agenda and for also his personal words because

768
01:03:42,189 --> 01:03:45,332
I think his tribute really struck home with me.

769
01:03:46,513 --> 01:03:50,497
Knowing Bud, you know, Bud was a friend to everyone.

770
01:03:51,417 --> 01:03:53,679
I had him a teacher when I was at the high school.

771
01:03:53,839 --> 01:03:54,580
He was my teacher.

772
01:03:55,961 --> 01:03:58,904
You know, I didn't play any sports under Bud.

773
01:03:58,964 --> 01:04:04,829
I actually wrestled for Method High School, but he was the athletic director and he cared about every program.

774
01:04:05,618 --> 01:04:08,180
And he cared about every kid individually.

775
01:04:08,560 --> 01:04:10,041
And he had a relationship.

776
01:04:10,061 --> 01:04:12,783
I don't know how he did it with every kid.

777
01:04:13,324 --> 01:04:14,785
And we all respected him.

778
01:04:15,285 --> 01:04:17,707
And he was tough as nails when he had to be.

779
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:20,189
And he let you know that he was there.

780
01:04:20,209 --> 01:04:22,430
And if you did something wrong, he let you know about it.

781
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:25,552
But he also had a side that was very sensitive.

782
01:04:26,273 --> 01:04:29,535
And Bud was truly a great family man.

783
01:04:30,236 --> 01:04:34,659
His wife, Judy, we used to joke around, come around this time every July.

784
01:04:35,632 --> 01:04:49,003
His wife and I would meet, and we used to meet at Stop and Shop around the cherries that came out every July, and we'd be the first in the cherry section, and we'd pick through all the cherries because we were cherry fiends.

785
01:04:49,603 --> 01:04:50,744
And we used to laugh about it.

786
01:04:50,944 --> 01:04:55,608
And they're just a great couple, Mr. President.

787
01:04:57,289 --> 01:05:02,613
Bud, I think, would be the first to lend a hand, as Councilor Scott Pelley mentioned.

788
01:05:03,073 --> 01:05:04,955
If he needed something, he'd be there.

789
01:05:05,716 --> 01:05:07,157
He'd be the first to help you out.

790
01:05:07,177 --> 01:05:09,278
He'd be the first to extend himself.

791
01:05:09,679 --> 01:05:11,060
He'd be the first to go to bat.

792
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,302
And, you know, that's what I remember about Bud Kelly.

793
01:05:14,882 --> 01:05:19,425
And you're absolutely right, my council colleagues, all three of that.

794
01:05:20,606 --> 01:05:33,875
You know, as we lose people of this character, people that made the city what it is, Mr. President, it truly is not just the loss of someone, it's the loss of, you know,

795
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:35,919
a feeling in the community.

796
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,640
It's the loss knowing that someone has your back.

797
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:44,202
It's the loss of having someone that is there with your best interest.

798
01:05:44,882 --> 01:05:48,863
And I think as we lose people like that, we really lose a part of the community.

799
01:05:49,603 --> 01:05:52,744
And I'm hoping that we start to build that camaraderie.

800
01:05:53,084 --> 01:05:58,326
We start to build that sense of neighborhood, that sense of belonging.

801
01:05:59,486 --> 01:06:02,687
And that's what, you know, I think Bud instilled

802
01:06:03,649 --> 01:06:05,090
how he acted in this community.

803
01:06:05,531 --> 01:06:07,092
It really was a sense of pride.

804
01:06:07,673 --> 01:06:14,958
And if you didn't go to the Thanksgiving football game, let me tell you, especially in the high school, you weren't getting an A or B anymore.

805
01:06:16,219 --> 01:06:19,842
You had to go to the game and he used to take attendance, believe me.

806
01:06:20,222 --> 01:06:27,168
And the crowds were huge because of Bud Kelly and because of the spirit and the pride that Bud Kelly had, Mr. President.

807
01:06:27,784 --> 01:06:29,084
And you're absolutely right.

808
01:06:29,104 --> 01:06:33,705
The blue and white, I don't think you can meet someone that had more blue and whites with their veins.

809
01:06:34,425 --> 01:06:36,306
Um, and he will be sorely missed.

810
01:06:36,386 --> 01:06:47,968
I, I feel awful, uh, for, uh, Judy and, uh, Beth and, um, uh, Linda and, uh, you know, the rest of the family, um, including the son-in-laws and so forth.

811
01:06:48,609 --> 01:06:55,130
Uh, because Bud was an excellent husband, father, grandfather, friend, coach.

812
01:06:56,667 --> 01:07:01,029
You name it, he excelled at everything and found the time to do so.

813
01:07:01,109 --> 01:07:03,950
And he will surely be missed, Mr. President.

814
01:07:04,250 --> 01:07:14,395
I ask, I know my colleague would want it, that we name Bud Kelly, dedicate this meeting after Bud Kelly in all his years of service, Mr. President.

815
01:07:15,595 --> 01:07:17,056
Thank you.

816
01:07:18,176 --> 01:07:20,877
Thank you, Mr. President.

817
01:07:22,398 --> 01:07:24,399
I had the honor to play football for Bud Kelly

818
01:07:26,025 --> 01:07:27,126
from 1985, 1986, and 1987.

819
01:07:27,206 --> 01:07:36,870
And I remember as a sophomore coming to Medford High School and being on the varsity team, it was quite intimidating.

820
01:07:37,070 --> 01:07:42,252
You had a lot of juniors and seniors that played.

821
01:07:42,312 --> 01:07:43,312
It was a great team in 1985.

822
01:07:43,472 --> 01:07:46,414
He was the head coach.

823
01:07:47,134 --> 01:07:51,516
But coming in as a sophomore, everyone at this council was really hit upon it.

824
01:07:52,016 --> 01:07:52,536
It was family.

825
01:07:52,869 --> 01:07:54,811
You came in, it didn't matter where you came from.

826
01:07:54,871 --> 01:07:57,674
It didn't matter who you were, you were family.

827
01:07:57,694 --> 01:07:59,455
And he preached that repeatedly.

828
01:08:00,296 --> 01:08:09,345
And it was about, you know, family, loyalty, being together, having fun, but also being serious too.

829
01:08:09,405 --> 01:08:11,907
When he had to be tough, he was tough, but he was fair.

830
01:08:12,868 --> 01:08:15,090
He was fair with everyone.

831
01:08:15,871 --> 01:08:17,292
It was probably one of the,

832
01:08:18,567 --> 01:08:21,329
You think about, you know, you play sports, you're part of clubs or groups.

833
01:08:21,429 --> 01:08:28,475
And it was probably one of the most fun moments of my life, you know, young life growing up, being 15 years old and being part of that.

834
01:08:29,096 --> 01:08:33,299
And, uh, you know, he was the last coach to win a GBL title in football.

835
01:08:33,940 --> 01:08:34,940
It's been quite some time.

836
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:38,563
It's been, uh, almost 30 years now, actually more than 30 years.

837
01:08:39,284 --> 01:08:46,690
Uh, but he was, uh, he was, you know, I remember seeing him after graduating and going to high school games, you'd see him as the AD then.

838
01:08:47,331 --> 01:08:47,551
And, uh,

839
01:08:48,463 --> 01:08:53,826
He was just a great guy, always a good friend, and someone who could really make you laugh.

840
01:08:54,947 --> 01:08:56,648
And, you know, he was a great family man.

841
01:08:56,688 --> 01:08:58,169
I remember those games in 1985.

842
01:08:58,229 --> 01:09:06,194
After we won, we'd always drive through Medford Square, pull up on the bus, and I think his wife worked at the dress shop right behind City Hall.

843
01:09:06,994 --> 01:09:15,099
And he'd stop the bus after every win, and everybody would be singing the Mustang Spice Song, and traffic would come to a stop.

844
01:09:15,907 --> 01:09:22,250
And literally he'd get out of the bus, he'd run across the street, his wife would come out and everybody that worked at the shop and he'd give his wife a kiss.

845
01:09:22,810 --> 01:09:26,252
And then he'd come back onto the bus and we'd make our way to the high school.

846
01:09:26,892 --> 01:09:30,934
And, uh, you know, it was just a really fun way to celebrate a victory.

847
01:09:30,954 --> 01:09:32,174
He was a great family man.

848
01:09:32,194 --> 01:09:36,096
And, uh, there was a lot of pride there in blue and white.

849
01:09:36,817 --> 01:09:39,838
If you play Mustang football, blue and white was running through your veins.

850
01:09:39,878 --> 01:09:44,360
If you played any sport, blue and white was running through your veins and he would preach that repeatedly.

851
01:09:44,999 --> 01:09:48,842
And, you know, the community is, this is a big loss to the community.

852
01:09:49,463 --> 01:09:54,026
And my, you know, thoughts and prayers and condolences go to the Kelly, to Judy Kelly and the family.

853
01:09:54,627 --> 01:09:55,988
And he will, he will be missed.

854
01:09:56,588 --> 01:09:57,829
Thank you.

855
01:09:58,910 --> 01:10:03,454
And on behalf of myself and my family, I knew Bud for many, many years.

856
01:10:03,494 --> 01:10:10,480
He, I had the opportunity to get to know him on a different level because he coached with my uncle for many, many years.

857
01:10:11,440 --> 01:10:12,221
Councilor Marks is right.

858
01:10:13,387 --> 01:10:17,068
Thanksgiving Day, God couldn't get into the home of the stadium.

859
01:10:17,409 --> 01:10:18,309
He didn't have a ticket.

860
01:10:18,789 --> 01:10:21,230
Sold out every year for many, many years.

861
01:10:21,310 --> 01:10:24,251
And he used to chastise me because I didn't play football.

862
01:10:25,071 --> 01:10:29,073
He says, big guy like you.

863
01:10:30,173 --> 01:10:33,435
He said, I want you on the team.

864
01:10:33,535 --> 01:10:36,136
I did play one year as a freshman year, but that was about it.

865
01:10:36,496 --> 01:10:38,177
But I knew Bud for many, many years.

866
01:10:38,257 --> 01:10:41,938
And he was part of the Super Bowl winning staff there.

867
01:10:42,331 --> 01:10:47,913
I think there's only one person left, that whole Super Bowl coaching staff.

868
01:10:49,953 --> 01:11:01,177
And like Councilor Scott probably said, men and women who have blue and white in their veins, they're dying quickly.

869
01:11:01,897 --> 01:11:07,398
And they're not, people just aren't stepping up to the degree that those people did.

870
01:11:10,458 --> 01:11:14,161
and there's a void in the community when another person passes on.

871
01:11:14,181 --> 01:11:17,923
So again, to the Bud and his family, my condolences.

872
01:11:18,824 --> 01:11:20,985
So if we could rise for a moment of silence, please.

873
01:11:39,077 --> 01:11:40,178
Mr. Clerk, could you please call the roll?

874
01:11:44,799 --> 01:11:45,339
Councilor Behrs.

875
01:11:45,980 --> 01:11:46,620
Councilor Falco.

876
01:11:46,661 --> 01:11:46,841
Yes.

877
01:11:47,241 --> 01:11:47,882
Vice President Knight.

878
01:11:47,922 --> 01:11:48,222
Yes.

879
01:11:48,462 --> 01:11:49,022
Councilor Marks.

880
01:11:49,243 --> 01:11:49,563
Yes.

881
01:11:49,723 --> 01:11:50,303
Councilor Morrell.

882
01:11:50,484 --> 01:11:50,664
Yes.

883
01:11:50,844 --> 01:11:51,564
Councilor Scarpelli.

884
01:11:51,625 --> 01:11:51,865
Yes.

885
01:11:52,045 --> 01:11:52,866
President Karaviello.

886
01:11:53,326 --> 01:11:54,807
Yes, I'm in favor of the motion, passes.

887
01:11:55,227 --> 01:11:57,950
Communications from the mayor.

888
01:11:57,970 --> 01:12:01,352
21412, dear President Karaviello and members of the city council.

889
01:12:02,273 --> 01:12:12,001
On behalf of the below entities, I respectfully submit to the Memphis city council the following requests for a food truck locations in the city of Medford.

890
01:12:12,842 --> 01:12:13,782
One, the sausage guy.

891
01:12:14,746 --> 01:12:16,447
Dates and times, June 25th, 2021, 7 p.m.

892
01:12:16,487 --> 01:12:17,167
July 10th, 2021, 7 p.m.

893
01:12:17,187 --> 01:12:17,507
July 17th, 2021, 7 p.m.

894
01:12:17,527 --> 01:12:18,147
August 6th, 2021, 7 p.m.

895
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:18,767
August 13th, 2021, 7 p.m.

896
01:12:19,428 --> 01:12:22,108
And the location, it would be at Hornbill Stadium.

897
01:12:22,128 --> 01:12:24,189
Are you here from the Sausage Guy?

898
01:12:24,209 --> 01:12:24,289
No.

899
01:12:24,309 --> 01:12:24,369
No.

900
01:12:24,389 --> 01:12:25,970
I'm here for the Boston Glory, the team that played

901
01:12:41,981 --> 01:12:44,983
and we're trying to get the sausage guy on board.

902
01:12:45,003 --> 01:12:45,924
Name and address of the director, please.

903
01:12:46,024 --> 01:12:47,225
Sure, Jason Tallerman.

904
01:12:47,285 --> 01:12:54,290
I'm the part owner and the director of operations for Boston Glory that has rented the facility for the spring and summer.

905
01:12:54,310 --> 01:12:56,292
Give us a little brief description of what Boston Glory is.

906
01:12:56,412 --> 01:12:58,874
So Boston Glory is a professional ultimate frisbee team.

907
01:12:59,134 --> 01:13:05,779
We've been practicing since March.

908
01:13:06,319 --> 01:13:10,162
Well, there we go.

909
01:13:11,017 --> 01:13:12,698
So we've been practicing since the spring.

910
01:13:12,718 --> 01:13:17,442
We were going to have our inaugural season last year, got delayed obviously.

911
01:13:17,622 --> 01:13:24,647
And we were, we started up this year, had our first home game this past Friday, had 600 fans, happy fans in there.

912
01:13:24,687 --> 01:13:28,350
It's a pretty successful 22 team national league.

913
01:13:28,530 --> 01:13:30,051
We're the newest entering in the league.

914
01:13:30,392 --> 01:13:37,597
Boston has a rich history of ultimate Frisbee with multiple national championships at a club and college.

915
01:13:38,182 --> 01:13:38,502
level.

916
01:13:38,522 --> 01:13:41,904
We're pleased to bring a product here to the city.

917
01:13:42,744 --> 01:13:54,850
Hormel has been terrific to us, the staff at Recreation at the Hormel Commission, Licensing Commission we're working with, Recreation, Mayor's Office, everyone's been incredibly welcoming.

918
01:13:54,951 --> 01:13:57,612
And a couple more pieces to the puzzle, we're meeting with the

919
01:13:58,233 --> 01:14:05,319
licensing commission next week to get a local brewery that can serve beer for us on a series of one day licenses.

920
01:14:05,919 --> 01:14:22,792
And the last piece of the puzzle would be to get some limited food service inside the gate so that we could serve our fans and have more fans and then have those more fans then either do pre-game or post-game in Medford's wonderful restaurants in the square and beyond.

921
01:14:22,832 --> 01:14:23,713
Excellent, excellent.

922
01:14:23,753 --> 01:14:23,953
Thank you.

923
01:14:25,013 --> 01:14:26,354
Questions for the gentleman.

924
01:14:26,894 --> 01:14:36,218
Mr. President, I actually had the opportunity of speaking with Mr. Tallman earlier, having some familiarity with the ongoings at Hormel Stadium in the rental of the fields.

925
01:14:36,418 --> 01:14:42,261
The history of Ultimate Frisbee in Medford is actually pretty strong and pretty proud.

926
01:14:42,341 --> 01:14:52,886
Just a couple of years ago, I do remember the Boston Whitecaps, I think was the name of the team that was competing in the national championship and were actually on ESPN's top 10 at Hormel Stadium.

927
01:14:53,747 --> 01:14:58,711
So they certainly do bring some interest to the area and certainly some bodies to the region.

928
01:14:59,151 --> 01:15:07,419
And I, for one, have no concerns supporting the Sausage Guys, Sausage Cat down at Hormel Stadium for these dates that have been selected.

929
01:15:07,979 --> 01:15:11,162
So with that being said, Mr. President, I certainly would move for approval on item one.

930
01:15:12,523 --> 01:15:12,783
Thank you.

931
01:15:16,040 --> 01:15:16,641
Thank you very much.

932
01:15:16,661 --> 01:15:18,723
Thank you for your presentation.

933
01:15:18,904 --> 01:15:21,187
Quick question, you said there were 22 teams in the league?

934
01:15:21,367 --> 01:15:22,068
22 teams in the league.

935
01:15:22,128 --> 01:15:22,708
And where are they from?

936
01:15:23,389 --> 01:15:24,210
All over the country.

937
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:30,678
So there's three teams, two teams in California, as far south as Florida and Texas.

938
01:15:32,716 --> 01:15:36,040
Minnesota, Chicago, Detroit, pretty much all the major hubs.

939
01:15:36,260 --> 01:15:42,528
So Boston was their last piece, Seattle, Boston, they've wanted a Boston team since the former league folded.

940
01:15:43,349 --> 01:15:47,274
And we got a couple of investors, including myself, and here we are.

941
01:15:47,554 --> 01:15:47,775
Great.

942
01:15:48,135 --> 01:15:49,356
And how long is your season?

943
01:15:49,396 --> 01:15:50,436
How many games do you play at home?

944
01:15:50,496 --> 01:15:57,359
So normally we, the season stretches from the spring to the mid-summer, but because of COVID, we're now playing throughout the summer.

945
01:15:57,839 --> 01:15:59,880
So we'll be at Hormel through August.

946
01:15:59,940 --> 01:16:05,503
And if we make the playoffs, maybe one game beyond that at Hormel, if we have a favorable record.

947
01:16:05,783 --> 01:16:06,163
Okay.

948
01:16:06,223 --> 01:16:08,304
And I'm sorry, how many, how many games do you play?

949
01:16:08,504 --> 01:16:10,605
We play 12 total regular season games.

950
01:16:10,925 --> 01:16:12,306
And then there's playoffs after that.

951
01:16:13,643 --> 01:16:14,324
It's pretty exciting.

952
01:16:14,344 --> 01:16:14,904
Thank you very much.

953
01:16:15,144 --> 01:16:15,465
Thank you.

954
01:16:16,105 --> 01:16:19,708
What I've seen before is that a city clerk is an ultimate frisbee.

955
01:16:20,729 --> 01:16:21,049
Perfect.

956
01:16:21,509 --> 01:16:22,570
Our own professional, I guess.

957
01:16:23,471 --> 01:16:28,775
I've been playing in a pickup league that's been in existence up at Car Park for more than 30 years.

958
01:16:28,815 --> 01:16:30,737
I've been playing with them for nine.

959
01:16:33,739 --> 01:16:39,581
You might have to take five of our teams to scrimmage once.

960
01:16:40,022 --> 01:16:44,504
Scrimmage against yours, that might give us some sort of advantage if we had five teams and you had one.

961
01:16:44,544 --> 01:16:47,485
But as you know, you know how much fun it is.

962
01:16:47,805 --> 01:16:48,906
It's a hard game to stop.

963
01:16:48,986 --> 01:16:50,226
I've been playing myself since 85.

964
01:16:50,827 --> 01:16:52,908
I'm now in the over 50 division.

965
01:16:52,928 --> 01:16:55,389
I'm a national and world champ at that division.

966
01:16:55,409 --> 01:16:56,109
Congratulations.

967
01:16:58,097 --> 01:16:58,398
What's that?

968
01:16:58,438 --> 01:16:58,860
Got a ring?

969
01:16:59,482 --> 01:17:00,164
I don't have a ring.

970
01:17:00,204 --> 01:17:01,248
I got a trophy at home.

971
01:17:05,940 --> 01:17:08,421
Okay, so we wanna vote on these separately.

972
01:17:08,441 --> 01:17:09,582
We have a second one here.

973
01:17:09,722 --> 01:17:12,443
Is the petitioner here for the second application?

974
01:17:12,483 --> 01:17:14,644
Yes, the Dunkin' Donuts is here for the second one also.

975
01:17:15,324 --> 01:17:15,625
Thank you.

976
01:17:15,905 --> 01:17:16,805
Hey, thank you so much.

977
01:17:16,905 --> 01:17:17,886
I appreciate it.

978
01:17:17,926 --> 01:17:19,246
Hope to see you all at a game.

979
01:17:19,306 --> 01:17:19,626
Thank you.

980
01:17:19,666 --> 01:17:20,747
Yeah, thank you.

981
01:17:20,987 --> 01:17:25,949
Number two, Kefauver Management Company, LLC, Dunkin' Donuts location.

982
01:17:26,670 --> 01:17:29,931
Start dates expected June 28th, 2021, 283 Middlesex Ave, Medford, August 2nd.

983
01:17:34,453 --> 01:17:43,699
2021 7 Commercial Street, Medford, and 283, 283 Mystic Avenue, Medford, and 7 Commercial Street, Medford.

984
01:17:45,280 --> 01:17:47,101
I see the representative of Declan Donovan is here.

985
01:17:47,381 --> 01:17:48,521
Name and address of the record, please.

986
01:17:48,682 --> 01:17:52,504
Hi, Emily Fitzgerald, 280 Merrimack Street, Methuen, Massachusetts.

987
01:17:53,624 --> 01:18:01,189
Can you give us a little brief update on what's going on and how long you've been needing these trucks for?

988
01:18:01,893 --> 01:18:08,894
So during those two weeks listed, we will be remodeling those Dunkin' Donuts locations to the next gen image.

989
01:18:09,934 --> 01:18:17,576
We like to use our dunking cart to make up for a loss of sales and hopefully not any loss of customers.

990
01:18:18,376 --> 01:18:28,378
We've had much success using this cart in other remodels in New York and Maine, and we are hoping to keep it going with a limited menu and limited hours.

991
01:18:30,721 --> 01:18:31,962
So we're hopeful.

992
01:18:31,982 --> 01:18:35,985
Okay, question to the petitioner.

993
01:18:36,565 --> 01:18:39,007
Vice President Knight.

994
01:18:39,468 --> 01:18:44,571
I'm not understanding this, so would it be located at the physical location of the store, just outside?

995
01:18:46,473 --> 01:18:46,953
Yes.

996
01:18:48,174 --> 01:18:58,982
Yes, so it's a cart, it's more of a trailer, it's enclosed, and then that's where the coffee and muffins are served to the customers.

997
01:19:00,073 --> 01:19:02,975
and it's just going to carry on just like a drive-through.

998
01:19:03,336 --> 01:19:10,001
The stations are positioned within the drive-through in the parking lot, so the traffic flow is the exact same.

999
01:19:11,182 --> 01:19:20,550
You come in, you stop at the tent, you order, you pull up to the cart, you get your coffee, your donut, whatever it may be, and you exit.

1000
01:19:21,691 --> 01:19:24,213
Do you have an existing drive-through window at this location presently?

1001
01:19:24,634 --> 01:19:24,834
Yes.

1002
01:19:26,075 --> 01:19:27,196
I think Middlesex Avenue.

1003
01:19:29,104 --> 01:19:30,805
And commercial street as well.

1004
01:19:31,326 --> 01:19:33,807
So I get the people to go inside the restaurant to go to the drive-thru.

1005
01:19:34,047 --> 01:19:35,969
They're gonna be remodeling inside the restaurant.

1006
01:19:35,989 --> 01:19:36,389
Remodeling?

1007
01:19:36,649 --> 01:19:36,829
Yes.

1008
01:19:37,249 --> 01:19:37,470
Yes.

1009
01:19:39,931 --> 01:19:44,234
Do you know how long you'll be remodeling each location?

1010
01:19:45,055 --> 01:19:47,076
Yes, each remodel is two weeks.

1011
01:19:47,556 --> 01:19:50,938
The cart runs Monday through Friday only, both of those two weeks.

1012
01:19:52,259 --> 01:19:53,460
Two weeks at each location?

1013
01:19:54,341 --> 01:19:54,681
Correct.

1014
01:19:55,301 --> 01:19:57,743
Will these be going on simultaneously?

1015
01:19:58,669 --> 01:19:59,389
are at different times.

1016
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:01,070
I'm sorry, say that again.

1017
01:20:01,090 --> 01:20:08,453
I said, well, the construction won't be going on at all these locations simultaneously or you're gonna finish on and then.

1018
01:20:09,753 --> 01:20:14,715
No, we are starting with the Middlesex Ave location tentatively June 28th.

1019
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:18,857
And then on August 2nd, we intend on starting seven commercial street.

1020
01:20:19,737 --> 01:20:19,958
Okay.

1021
01:20:21,038 --> 01:20:22,098
All right.

1022
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:23,999
Senior Councilor Baxton.

1023
01:20:25,180 --> 01:20:26,120
Thank you, Mr. President.

1024
01:20:27,329 --> 01:20:32,355
So the lot on Middlesex Ave is quite a large lot.

1025
01:20:32,915 --> 01:20:34,977
So I could see that working on Middlesex Ave.

1026
01:20:35,438 --> 01:20:40,103
The lot on Commercial Street is a very difficult lot to get in.

1027
01:20:40,664 --> 01:20:46,691
And I can only imagine during construction, I was just wondering if you can lay out what the plans are.

1028
01:20:46,711 --> 01:20:47,832
You said there's a tent and

1029
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:52,251
you know, they're going to be able to access through the tent and drive through.

1030
01:20:52,291 --> 01:21:01,314
Can you just explain, are they going to use the existing drive-through even though it's closed as a way to go in and out of that very small lot?

1031
01:21:01,674 --> 01:21:04,635
Can you just explain how it's going to work?

1032
01:21:04,655 --> 01:21:09,896
They are going to pull in the entrance as they normally would to enter the drive-through.

1033
01:21:10,176 --> 01:21:16,298
The tent is set up right over the drive-through lane where they pull up, they enter and

1034
01:21:17,003 --> 01:21:21,527
order through our employees and they pay under the tent, or I'm sorry, next to the tent.

1035
01:21:22,107 --> 01:21:25,289
The employees stand underneath the tent just for rain and shine.

1036
01:21:26,690 --> 01:21:34,456
Then they pull up to the cart and there's an employee standing there with their beverage, which is located right again in the drive-thru and they exit.

1037
01:21:36,018 --> 01:21:36,218
Right.

1038
01:21:36,618 --> 01:21:44,364
So part of my concern, Mr. President, and I know they're actually working on the Dunkin' Donuts on the Fellsway right now.

1039
01:21:44,824 --> 01:21:45,605
It's been closed for

1040
01:21:46,120 --> 01:21:46,780
I believe two days.

1041
01:21:48,641 --> 01:21:59,585
But part of my concern is when this duck and donuts originally went in, there was some grave concern about the queuing up of cars that are going through the drive-through.

1042
01:22:00,186 --> 01:22:04,647
And the reason that was raised is we all know that engine four is next door.

1043
01:22:05,488 --> 01:22:07,709
And believe it or not, it's not unheard of.

1044
01:22:07,849 --> 01:22:08,609
I live in the area.

1045
01:22:09,194 --> 01:22:21,504
that on certain days, you'll see the cars queuing up onto Commercial Street and out onto Riverside Ave, and not far from the entrance to the fire station.

1046
01:22:22,485 --> 01:22:27,189
My only concern now is you're gonna be backing up where cars are gonna be coming in.

1047
01:22:27,249 --> 01:22:36,697
The tent will be right where the entrance is, I assume where the doors are, and you're gonna be backing up cars queuing onto Riverside and Commercial.

1048
01:22:37,765 --> 01:22:42,648
And depending on the flow and so forth, I have some concern, Mr. President.

1049
01:22:43,609 --> 01:22:48,572
Is this something that has been run by public safety officials in the community?

1050
01:22:51,353 --> 01:22:51,574
No.

1051
01:22:53,755 --> 01:22:54,936
Not on my behalf, no.

1052
01:22:56,096 --> 01:22:59,879
I would just respectfully ask, I'm not opposed to what they're trying to do, Mr. President.

1053
01:23:00,459 --> 01:23:02,040
I just want to make sure it makes sense.

1054
01:23:03,311 --> 01:23:06,233
Like I said, this is a much smaller lot than Middlesex Ave.

1055
01:23:06,574 --> 01:23:12,297
Middlesex Ave can accommodate, you know, the big Apple Circus there under a tent and so forth.

1056
01:23:12,317 --> 01:23:15,419
But Commercial Street is a congested lot.

1057
01:23:15,439 --> 01:23:20,282
There's no access from Riverside Ave into their lot, either come into Commercial.

1058
01:23:20,903 --> 01:23:24,445
Getting in and out of their lot inherently is difficult already.

1059
01:23:25,621 --> 01:23:31,804
and I'm sure you would know as someone that's involved with that Dunkin Donuts, I just wanna make sure.

1060
01:23:32,104 --> 01:23:53,834
So I would ask that approval be conditioned upon getting approval from both the fire and police chief that they don't anticipate any concerns with public safety regarding access to our fire trucks getting in and out of engine four and also safety with the president of vehicles queuing up potentially onto Riverside Ave.

1061
01:23:54,167 --> 01:23:56,007
So that would be my recommendation, Mr. President.

1062
01:23:56,628 --> 01:23:58,028
Thank you.

1063
01:23:58,528 --> 01:24:00,008
As amended by council member.

1064
01:24:01,089 --> 01:24:01,709
Council member.

1065
01:24:02,429 --> 01:24:03,509
Thank you, Mr. President.

1066
01:24:03,529 --> 01:24:04,149
A quick question.

1067
01:24:04,189 --> 01:24:06,810
I believe, did you say there were abbreviated hours?

1068
01:24:08,570 --> 01:24:08,790
Yes.

1069
01:24:09,751 --> 01:24:09,971
Okay.

1070
01:24:10,011 --> 01:24:12,091
Can you just elaborate on that?

1071
01:24:12,191 --> 01:24:16,992
Is it the same hours for each location or does each location have different hours?

1072
01:24:17,672 --> 01:24:21,693
Typically we run the cart from six to two in the afternoon.

1073
01:24:24,323 --> 01:24:26,064
That would be the same for both locations.

1074
01:24:27,124 --> 01:24:28,245
Okay, so 6 a.m.

1075
01:24:28,285 --> 01:24:28,905
to 2 p.m.

1076
01:24:29,385 --> 01:24:33,707
for both locations for the duration of the remodel?

1077
01:24:34,227 --> 01:24:34,608
Correct.

1078
01:24:35,728 --> 01:24:39,430
I apologize, did you say the remodel was going to be two weeks?

1079
01:24:40,390 --> 01:24:40,590
Yes.

1080
01:24:43,151 --> 01:24:43,812
Okay, thank you.

1081
01:24:44,212 --> 01:24:44,812
Councilor Morocco.

1082
01:24:45,612 --> 01:24:46,193
Thank you, Mr. President.

1083
01:24:46,293 --> 01:24:50,135
Councilor Fabio asked my question, so I'm all set.

1084
01:24:50,295 --> 01:24:51,175
Thank you, Mr. President.

1085
01:24:51,934 --> 01:24:57,256
How many Dunkin' Donuts locations does your management company operate or own?

1086
01:24:57,977 --> 01:24:58,537
Entirely?

1087
01:24:59,377 --> 01:24:59,597
Yes.

1088
01:25:00,738 --> 01:25:01,798
Just shy of 300.

1089
01:25:02,839 --> 01:25:03,139
Okay.

1090
01:25:04,259 --> 01:25:11,382
And you have, you know, two locations within a pretty reasonable distance from the locations you're going to be remodeling.

1091
01:25:12,103 --> 01:25:17,585
Why not just send customers to the next closest location that you are owning?

1092
01:25:19,561 --> 01:25:23,662
It's really just to try to keep our customers on their same daily patterns.

1093
01:25:23,842 --> 01:25:30,624
And, you know, the customers that you go to Dunkin' Donuts on Middlesex every day, because that's the one you pass.

1094
01:25:30,784 --> 01:25:36,086
You don't pass the one on, say, Fells Way or whichever other road.

1095
01:25:38,107 --> 01:25:41,368
That's really, it's just to keep the same customers coming to the same location.

1096
01:25:42,928 --> 01:25:47,009
Yeah, I personally am not in favor of this.

1097
01:25:47,109 --> 01:25:48,710
I think you could say

1098
01:25:49,477 --> 01:25:51,358
Down the street is our Felsway location.

1099
01:25:51,418 --> 01:25:52,458
We'll be closed for two weeks.

1100
01:25:52,478 --> 01:25:58,280
And if you own hundreds of Dunkin' Donuts, it doesn't seem like it would hurt the bottom line that much to me.

1101
01:25:58,340 --> 01:25:59,700
So that's where I stand on this.

1102
01:25:59,740 --> 01:26:00,080
Thank you.

1103
01:26:00,980 --> 01:26:01,281
Thank you.

1104
01:26:01,581 --> 01:26:05,522
Vice President Knight, I'm somewhat in line with what Councilor Baez is saying.

1105
01:26:05,562 --> 01:26:09,543
I mean, I just don't like the precedent it sets, and I don't really feel as though it

1106
01:26:11,668 --> 01:26:14,390
falls in line with the intent of a food truck pilot program.

1107
01:26:14,410 --> 01:26:22,254
You know, we were talking about food trucks, we were talking about, you know, having the ability to, you know, bring the sausage guy to Hormel Stadium so that someone could have an event.

1108
01:26:22,294 --> 01:26:25,937
And I really think that, you know, remodeling the business, that's a cost of doing business.

1109
01:26:26,197 --> 01:26:32,721
And I think that the public safety concerns are going to outweigh, you know, the benefits that they're going to provide to the community, number one.

1110
01:26:33,121 --> 01:26:39,605
And number two, because it doesn't seem to really fall in line with the intent of our food truck ordinance, I'm going to have a difficult time supporting it this evening.

1111
01:26:40,666 --> 01:26:41,406
Thank you, Vice President.

1112
01:26:41,773 --> 01:26:49,441
Ma'am, are you going to be offering the same menu that you have in your stores, or will they be cooking under the tents?

1113
01:26:50,563 --> 01:26:51,544
It's a limited menu.

1114
01:26:52,104 --> 01:26:52,625
No cooking.

1115
01:26:53,506 --> 01:26:59,032
It's strictly hot coffee, coffee, iced tea, bottled water, and donuts.

1116
01:26:59,873 --> 01:27:00,033
Thanks.

1117
01:27:02,377 --> 01:27:03,477
Move approval, Mr. President.

1118
01:27:03,497 --> 01:27:06,498
So on the motion by City Council Marks.

1119
01:27:06,598 --> 01:27:07,178
As amended.

1120
01:27:07,678 --> 01:27:08,278
As amended.

1121
01:27:08,478 --> 01:27:09,298
Mr. President.

1122
01:27:09,398 --> 01:27:11,499
Are you going to sign off?

1123
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:15,800
I request that we vote on the sausage guy and the Dunkin' Donuts separately, please.

1124
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:16,400
That's fine.

1125
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:17,380
Okay.

1126
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:19,901
On the motion by Council Mears that we sever this.

1127
01:27:19,921 --> 01:27:25,442
All in favor, aye.

1128
01:27:25,822 --> 01:27:25,922
Aye.

1129
01:27:26,242 --> 01:27:26,402
Aye.

1130
01:27:26,742 --> 01:27:30,463
Okay, so the first one is the sausage guy.

1131
01:27:31,365 --> 01:27:33,506
with the dates and times that have been mentioned.

1132
01:27:35,606 --> 01:27:37,687
Vice President Knight has moved for approval.

1133
01:27:37,947 --> 01:27:39,688
Seconded by Councilor Mayes.

1134
01:27:41,528 --> 01:27:42,248
All those in favor?

1135
01:27:42,768 --> 01:27:42,908
Aye.

1136
01:27:43,309 --> 01:27:44,009
Motion passes.

1137
01:27:44,549 --> 01:27:56,072
On the capital management, on the motion by Councilor Mox, seconded by Councilor Scarpelli.

1138
01:27:56,512 --> 01:27:57,773
With the condition, Mr. President,

1139
01:27:59,245 --> 01:28:06,507
Duncan Donuts receive a sign off from both the chief of police and the fire chief regarding any potential safety concerns.

1140
01:28:07,787 --> 01:28:08,988
Okay, all those in favor.

1141
01:28:10,428 --> 01:28:10,768
Aye.

1142
01:28:13,109 --> 01:28:14,169
The chair seemed to be in doubt.

1143
01:28:14,189 --> 01:28:15,450
