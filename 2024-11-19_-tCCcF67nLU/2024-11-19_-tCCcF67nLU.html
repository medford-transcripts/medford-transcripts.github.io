    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=37.82s">Motions,</a>  orders, and resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=39.783s">Paper</a>  21404, offered by President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=44.148s">Be</a>  it so resolved, the Medford City Council discuss the report submitted by the traffic engineer in regard to High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=50.216s">Be</a>  it further resolved, the traffic engineer and the city engineer be available to address this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=55.501s">a</a>  council Scarpelli offered an amendment requesting that the MBTA be contacted for answers and that the MBTA representatives meet with the council and committee of the whole for further discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=64.389s">Be</a>  Councilor bears off an amendment that the 710 bus be included in discussions at this meeting.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=77.303s">Because</a>  they run sort of together.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=80.126s">There</a>  are no objections. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=81.026s">Paper</a>  21407, be it so resolved, the Medford City Council go on record as informing the city administration as being opposed to the new island installation of High Street, Rubin Street, and Hastings Lane for it directly affects the public safety of the immediate area residents, bus, truck, and public safety equipment, especially in times of an emergency and extreme inclement weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=100.723s">Be</a>  it further resolved, the new intersection island at the Woburn Street intersection of High Street exposes the City of Medford to potential lawsuits from any such accidents from the installation, and as such, we, the City Council, respectfully put the City Administration on notice for being opposed for making our city exposed for liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=117.69s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=118.91s">Mr.</a>  President, this is something that's been out there for a couple of weeks now that I put on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=123.845s">and</a>  disregard to the new traffic configuration at the top of High Street, Woobin, and Hastings. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=132.632s">I</a>  lived on Hastings Lane at the top of the street for 10 years, and I know the safety issues that go up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=139.977s">I</a>  lived in the house there, and when the trucks came by, my house rattled. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=145.021s">And</a>  I don't know if anybody's gone by to see the island there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=148.405s">Not</a>  that I'm opposed to having an island somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=151.33s">That</a>  is not a location where that island should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=153.954s">First</a>  of all, it's narrow for trucks to traverse at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=160.38s">Route</a>  60 is a major truck route. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=163.662s">Gasoline</a>  tankers go by there all day and night. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=167.465s">Be</a>  there at 2, 3 in the morning when those trucks go rolling down there in the dark. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=171.588s">They're</a>  not going to see that, and someone's going to hit it because there's no light there on either end. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=175.812s">Someone's</a>  going to hit it, and they're going to tip over, and you're going to see a fuel spill, similar to what we saw on the Merritt-Arlington line some years back. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=184.484s">They</a>  spilled 30,000 gallons of fuel into the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=188.645s">And</a>  I don't want to see that happen again over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=190.706s">So</a>  people are saying that I don't care about public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=193.727s">The</a>  reason I have this here is because I do care about public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=196.948s">And</a>  I care about the public safety of the people that live in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=200.409s">That's</a>  my neighborhood where I live. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=203.53s">On</a>  Sunday, the island has been hit. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=206.675s">Sunday</a>  morning at 9 o'clock in the morning, the island got hit by a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=209.837s">It</a>  had to be taken out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=211.558s">DPOW</a>  had to clean up the mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=213.579s">And</a>  it just started. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=215.9s">It's</a>  only been there for three weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=219.442s">The</a>  fire chief had the fire trucks get on there, try to make the turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=223.064s">He</a>  says, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=223.604s">He</a>  says the truck was able to make the turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=225.866s">He</a>  says it was a little thin. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=227.226s">He</a>  said there was only a foot of space on both sides of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=232.569s">What</a>  are we going to do in the wintertime <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=234.58s">when</a>  there's snow on the road there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=236.341s">And</a>  the road goes from 10 feet down to 8 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=240.264s">And</a>  those trucks, how do they make that turn? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=243.647s">So</a>  if you read the traffic engineer's report, he wants you to go into the opposite lane and make the turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=250.231s">Talk</a>  to the firemen that did the test route. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=254.154s">Why</a>  wasn't the chief consultant on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=256.956s">This</a>  is the man that <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=259.234s">He's</a>  one of our chief safety officers in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=262.257s">He</a>  wasn't even consulted on this yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=264.54s">Again,</a>  it's not about the island, but it's the placement of the island. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=271.388s">Listen.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=275.144s">You</a>  want to have an island. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=275.885s">The</a>  island on Woolman Street is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=277.906s">That</a>  island on High Street, it's narrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=280.348s">Go</a>  down to the island by the Brooks School, much wider, and it's not on a turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=287.034s">Now,</a>  when the trucks are coming up the hill, they have to accelerate to get up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=291.878s">It's</a>  going to be difficult to picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=293.319s">There's</a>  got to be a light, at least, on one side of that in order to break that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=297.203s">If</a>  not, accidents are going to continue to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=300.526s">Listen.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=302.566s">The</a>  government makes mistakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=303.526s">We</a>  make mistakes and then we do things wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=305.507s">Let's</a>  figure out what we did wrong here and try to fix it and make it right before the city ends up getting sued and before somebody gets hurt on that piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=317.071s">And</a>  it is about public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=319.832s">It's</a>  not anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=321.432s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=325.454s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Morell.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=328.115s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=328.895s">Is</a>  the traffic engineer on the call? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=331.596s">Do</a>  we know?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=332.983s">I</a>  can't answer that question because the council president's computer shut off.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=336.426s">I</a>  just have questions for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=337.526s">So</a>  if they're not here, I don't have anything right now.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=360.2s">I</a>  do not see the traffic engineer on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=362.441s">Nope,</a>  sitting in there, the traffic engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=364.802s">Any</a>  other councilors have anything they'd like to say?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=367.903s">Councilor</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=368.603s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=370.464s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello for putting this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=375.066s">As</a>  it stands, you know, it says as being opposed to the new island installation, I'm not opposed to an island. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=381.048s">If</a>  we could change that to concerns regarding the placement of the new island installation, then I would be more comfortable voting for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=387.251s">All</a>  right, did you get that, Mr. Clerk?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=400.894s">So</a>  you want to amend it to say concerns regarding placement of the new island?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=405.216s">Yeah,</a>  so where it says as being opposed to, change that to that we have concerns regarding the placement of. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=415.959s">I</a>  wouldn't mind seeing it redesigned, but if it's essential, it's, you know.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=420.641s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Morocco.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=425.908s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=426.929s">I'm</a>  curious if we could also request from the city solicitor just if this does, in fact, open us up to liability, if it's up to code, you know, does that open us up to liability? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=436.474s">I</a>  mean, I know people can sue for whatever, but are we, in fact, opened up to liability if this meets the code?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=442.818s">Do</a>  you offer that as an amendment or as a B paper?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=445.039s">An</a>  amendment, if you'll oblige. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=448.581s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=451.903s">Chair,</a>  wait a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=453.764s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=456.162s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=459.79s">Chair</a>  recognizes Mr. Penter at the podium.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=463.132s">Good</a>  evening, my name is Bob Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of the Sarkis party. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=467.496s">I</a>  would respectfully disagree with using the word concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=470.279s">The</a>  fact of the matter is that an accident has already taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=472.921s">Tank</a>  has already been going down that road and coming up that road. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=476.184s">You</a>  have MBTA buses telling you, you have a line from your own traffic consultant that tells you that a fire truck, if has to, can go on the opposite lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=486.073s">You</a>  have no idea at what time of day or night that that might be happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=489.436s">The</a>  whole idea, I believe, the impetus of the council president's resolution is to let this city administration know that this council is not supportive of this type of islands coming in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=503.304s">You</a>  can call it part of the complete streets program, the $563,000 that the city got from the commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=509.888s">Where</a>  was the fire chief being consulted on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=512.33s">Where</a>  was the city engineer being consulted? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=514.251s">And</a>  all these proposed bump outs that are being planned right now, continuing down on High Street, going into the West Medford area, where's the consultation for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=523.599s">Just</a>  go look at Sagamore Avenue and see the way they want to have that cutout coming out into the middle of High Street and then Boston Avenue over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=531.064s">And</a>  then further down, right opposite the Brooks School, there's a gentleman who just did his driveway over and he's got a bump out in front of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=536.308s">It</a>  doesn't make any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=538.49s">I</a>  would not change one word in the president's resolution, only for one reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=542.311s">The</a>  city administration has to know that you do recognize that this is a safety problem here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=548.192s">This</a>  isn't just for cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=549.753s">This</a>  is for trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=550.873s">This</a>  is for ambulances. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=552.273s">This</a>  is for other kinds of vehicles that are heavy duty going down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=556.334s">And</a>  we're not talking about a good day, as the council just alluded to on Sunday at 9 o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=561.795s">The</a>  gentleman, unfortunately, didn't see the island. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=564.376s">Not</a>  only didn't see the island, he wrecked the whole bottom of the carriage of his car. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=568.738s">What</a>  are you going to do in a snowstorm when it's dark out late at night and you have a big heavy tanker going down there? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=575.046s">What</a>  are you going to do with a bicycle, a gentleman or a lady driving their bike down there, going in that little lane there, and you have an emergency vehicle trying to get by? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=585.42s">You</a>  know, one thing I learned after many years of being on this council is one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=590.962s">If</a>  you know you see something that's wrong, why would you want to just smooth it over, use the word of concern as relates to telling the city administration, you're going to continue on with this complete streets program, this traffic calming issue, then the public safety is the priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=608.887s">And</a>  right now it's quite obvious that it's not a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=611.547s">Correct</a>  me if I'm wrong, Council President, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=613.828s">Fire</a>  Chief said, even though he can get by, he's only got a foot on either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=617.818s">Is</a>  that what he said?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=620.863s">to</a>  the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=622.184s">The</a>  chief said that it was, he said he had about a foot on either side, and on Sunday at the cemetery, I talked to the people who actually drove the test route, and they said it was a little tight, but they have concerns about making that turn in the winter, when the roadway gets narrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=640.512s">So</a>  that's where the concern is. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=642.413s">And</a>  if you look down where the islands by the Brooks School is, you can see how much wider it is there versus the width <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=651.283s">on</a>  the turn.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=653.904s">I</a>  would believe that the impetus of the resolution, if you want to get to the concern that Mr. Isaac Beers has introduced, that would be something that they would once again look at to come back, okay, we'll redesign it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=667.652s">But</a>  you'd lose your impact by putting the city on notice that you've recognized, you've talked, this is four times in a month, you have discussed this issue and it's not going away. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=679.152s">And</a>  the only way it's going to go away is if the city administration is aware of it and whoever their contact is with the state for the purposes of trying to make this correction, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=688.674s">As</a>  of this Sunday, the fire chief, as of this Sunday, the fire chief still hasn't been informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=693.175s">So</a>  he had to go out there and do his dry run. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=695.555s">Well,</a>  how do you call that progress? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=697.916s">How</a>  do you call that when somebody is supposed to sit down and let's talk about this traffic calming issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=703.837s">How</a>  can it be traffic calming when you haven't even spoken to the public safety personnel who it's going to affect? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=710.559s">You</a>  know, it isn't like you guys, young lady, are in a tough bind. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=716.882s">It's</a>  a very simple resolution that the President has offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=723.225s">as</a>  the mayor of this community and to your departments, we're putting you on notice because God forbid something happens and somebody gets killed, this council has put the city on notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=733.328s">If</a>  not, God forbid something happens and you modify that resolution, you're all gonna be part of a lawsuit. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=740.93s">And</a>  then you're gonna have to explain your way out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=743.651s">That's</a>  wrong and that shouldn't happen like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=747.454s">I</a>  would suggest, Mr. President, that you do not accept the resolution to modify it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=752.939s">Just</a>  make it as a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=754.02s">It's</a>  not a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=755.001s">It's</a>  an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=755.842s">It's</a>  a public safety issue that demands its attention one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=760.987s">And</a>  if they don't want to resolve it, shame on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=763.129s">At</a>  least the council's on record explaining the reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=766.172s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=768.034s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=770.837s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=787.167s">their</a>  potential concerns on this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=790.509s">We</a>  also did hear back from the traffic engineer and the city engineer regarding the design standards and safety standards that meet state and federal guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=801.776s">And</a>  at this point, in my opinion, that intersection of Woburn and High was a free-for-all. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=809.892s">a</a>  complete free-for-all. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=811.834s">This</a>  actually makes a difference, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=815.316s">It</a>  clearly defines going up or taking a right or a left. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=820.3s">It</a>  clearly defines it now, which never existed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=823.663s">Now,</a>  if the issue is whether or not a fire apparatus can get there during snow time and clement weather and so forth, that's an issue that needs to be looked at and addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=832.43s">I</a>  don't think anyone doubts what former Councilor Pence is stating. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=836.873s">And</a>  I'm hoping that's taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=839.035s">because</a>  we've addressed this on several occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=841.856s">But</a>  by no stretch, Mr. President, do I believe that this area was better off prior to the work that was done, because I do believe that work clearly delineates where you have to go now and where you have to stay and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=857.864s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=860.506s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=861.826s">The</a>  major concern is the width of the roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=865.472s">That's</a>  the real concern, where it really narrows down to a very narrow point there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=871.475s">That's</a>  really the big concern that I have, that it needs some more space on both sides of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=878.158s">That's</a>  the whole crux of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=882.92s">Again,</a>  if someone's riding a bike and a car down there, they can't fit together. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=887.382s">It</a>  needs to be widened a little more at some point there.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=890.185s">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=891.185s">And</a>  I don't disagree with you, but I'm saying at some point we have to rely on the experts and the professionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=898.252s">And</a>  if they're telling us that this complies with all safety standards and so forth, I think we have to at least rely on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=905.158s">But</a>  I don't know if that's fully been vetted out yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=908.18s">And</a>  just because the state came in and did work there, to me, I think it at least, at the very least, requires an additional look. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=916.123s">And</a>  that's, I think, what we've been asking for the last three or four weeks, for the city to take an additional look. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=921.825s">Asking</a>  to take stuff down now and so forth, I don't have the expertise to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=926.725s">You</a>  know, I don't have the expertise to say take something down. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=929.868s">What</a>  I do have is the common sense to say maybe it should be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=933.832s">But</a>  clearly, these type of initiatives, and I've been talking about them for 20 years, so I can't take a back step on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=940.8s">Traffic</a>  calming initiatives do work in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=944.138s">And</a>  these are traffic calming issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=946.599s">We</a>  may not like this one in particular or think it doesn't fit in this particular area, but these bump outs, these extending of sidewalks, these definitely make a difference when it comes to slowing traffic down. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=958.803s">It's</a>  a known fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=960.444s">It's</a>  not only happening in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=961.984s">It's</a>  happening all over the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=963.705s">across</a>  the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=964.545s">So</a>  I think we have to proceed with caution on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=968.507s">I</a>  support having it looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=970.547s">You're</a>  right, if it is a safety concern, I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=973.628s">That's</a>  a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=974.408s">And</a>  if we're in fear that trucks may have a hard time navigating over there, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=980.47s">I</a>  think we're obligated to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=982.931s">But</a>  I'm not an engineer or a professional to say that we should start redesigning, because I don't know what a redesign would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=990.076s">That's</a>  not something that I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=992.738s">So</a>  I will support the resolution, because I think it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=998.982s">But</a>  I'm not prepared to say that we have to take a step back and start redesigning things, because that's not in my realm.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1007.247s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1008.628s">Couldn't</a>  agree with you more, Councilman Max. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1012.736s">Chair</a>  recognizes Jared Powell. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1014.458s">Clerk,</a>  will the clerk please unmute Jared Powell.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1163.281s">Just</a>  in response to Council max. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1165.983s">Nobody's</a>  asking anything to be redesigned I don't think any of us have that expertise we're aware of that, but nobody came into the city and sat down with the public safety people, as it relates to all these locations that are being promulgated, and whether a review after four months <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1182.35s">I</a>  mean, after four weeks talking about this and there's still, there is still no communication with the public safety personnel of this city, which means either one or two things, either the city administration is not listening to the council, the city engineers not listening to the council. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1197.512s">And</a>  you have a fire chief who's basically telling you, you might have a problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1201.414s">You</a>  have a city traffic engineer turns around and tells you, well, if something happens, you can go to the opposite side of the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1207.537s">Well,</a>  that in and of itself tells you right there, don't talk about public safety when you have a fire truck coming at you on the opposite side of the street, if an emergency exists, or if there's a snowstorm or whatever it might be. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1219.06s">The</a>  whole idea I believe of the impotence of this whole resolution is to put the city on notice that you're not happy with the island there because it is, it has the potential to cause problems and if it's going to cause problems in an accident for which you've already had one it's already started. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1233.951s">You</a>  know, keep us out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1235.793s">We</a>  should not be part of any lawsuit by any citizen, city of Medford or other city of Medford, because we told you this was going to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1243.402s">Maybe</a>  it might be wise, Mr. President, to invite the state in to sit down with the city council and review every one of these locations that they want to put in. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1252.032s">How</a>  many accidents have taken place? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1253.833s">This</a>  is the reason why we're putting it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1255.774s">Where</a>  the bump boats are going and what's the reason for it? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1258.695s">They</a>  made the determination. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1260.236s">They</a>  don't live in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1262.016s">They're</a>  not the experts for the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1265.118s">It's</a>  our city engineer and our public safety because if it's going to impede anything that they do on a daily basis, they should be primary before any decision is made. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1275.623s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1278.524s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1280.438s">Want</a>  to be made clear. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1281.299s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1282.68s">Let</a>  me be clear, not opposed to any of the bump outs or anything like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1285.722s">They're</a>  fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1286.382s">I</a>  think those are all fine and great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1289.244s">But</a>  I say it's just that it's that width of the island there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1292.246s">So</a>  that's really the only concern that I have.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1299.311s">Councilor</a>  Marksley, notice your microphone's on. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1301.532s">You</a>  all set? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1302.553s">I'm</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1303.294s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1306.896s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1309.155s">seconded</a>  by councilor Scarpelli as amended by councilor Biaza seconded by councilor Scarpelli as further amended by councilor Morell as seconded by councilor Scarpelli. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1320.104s">All</a>  those in favor, please say aye. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1326.449s">Wow,</a>  that was great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1330.672s">All</a>  those in opposition, please say aye. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1333.775s">Hearing</a>  none, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative, the motion passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1341.205s">Council</a>  paper 21406 offered by Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1344.967s">Be</a>  it resolved that the Medford Chess Club Outdoor Riverside Avenue Park Sunday Club meetings be discussed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1351.571s">A,</a>  Councilor Scarpelli offered an amendment requesting that the administration ask the Director of Recreation to reach out to this organization. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1357.815s">B,</a>  Councilor Falco offered an amendment requesting the DPW look into the water spigots in the park to ensure they're working properly. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1364.638s">C,</a>  Councilor Falco offered an amendment requesting the Medford Police Department increase its patrols in the area on Sundays. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1371.418s">D,</a>  Vice President Knight offered an amendment requesting that the Recreation Department apply for determination of eligibility from the Community Preservation Committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1380.985s">Councilor</a>  Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1382.606s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1383.987s">I</a>  offered this last week under suspension and therefore under our council rules, it appears the following week, we had many discussions regarding the park on Riverside Ave and the usefulness of having <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1402.033s">a</a>  chess, actually a statewide chess club, being able to, on Sundays, use that particular area. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1410.257s">And</a>  I think, Mr. Vice President, you brought up a great point about that being recognized as a park and may require permitting and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1419.261s">But</a>  at the time, one of the organizers, Chris Donovan, who started this roughly two years ago to attract additional foot traffic to Medford Square, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1430.197s">came</a>  up with the idea, and there's a local Method chess club. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1434.779s">They've</a>  been going down there ever since, I believe on weekends. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1439.562s">And</a>  it was his thought if, you know, the old field of dreams, if we build it out to suit those who play chess, for instance, Chris sent me a number of pitches, which he sent to our director of Parks and Recreation of Stone <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1460.032s">chest</a>  tables with chairs that are fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1463.074s">So</a>  they're fixed right to the ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1464.995s">There's</a>  no set up and tear down every time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1467.936s">It's</a>  far easier for community to put on these type of events. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1472.418s">And</a>  the, according to Chris Donovan, the city's parks and recreations are currently looking at some fixed tables, chest tables to use that are made out of concrete or steel. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1485.965s">They're</a>  looking at shade umbrellas because as we all know, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1489.611s">That</a>  area is pretty wide open to the sun and is not conducive to people playing chess in the sun for any more than a short period of time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1499.459s">So</a>  they're looking for shade. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1500.821s">They're</a>  also looking for, which I believe they just purchased, and I want to thank the city, two foot tall chess pieces that are family friendly. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1509.308s">So</a>  if you're not that great of a chess player, you can go down there with your family and put around with the giant two foot chess pieces <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1518.735s">And</a>  there'll be people down there that will show you how to play the game of chess, which I think is a family fun activity for all, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1527.538s">They're</a>  looking to have tournaments down there and for eventually that this be one of the recognized stops in Massachusetts for professional chess tournaments. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1538.281s">And</a>  it's just one addition to the square, which I think would be much needed for additional foot traffic. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1546.444s">I</a>  want to thank Chris Donovan. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1548.985s">for</a>  his efforts on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1551.207s">And</a>  I know my council colleagues agree that we believe that this would be a great asset to the square and something that, you know, provide the additional foot traffic to those businesses that have been stuck with this pandemic for the past 15 months and welcome additional people into the square. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1574.679s">So</a>  I just want to thank Chris again and <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1578.323s">I</a>  look forward to the city moving forward over the summer with this chess club, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1584.488s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1588.791s">Councilor</a>  Marks, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1590.772s">Councilor</a>  Falco, the chair recognizes Councilor Falco.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1642.353s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1642.574s">It's</a>  certainly not a problem, Councilor Lococo.</p>

the project has about 60% of the track laid for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1829.078s">So</a>  in Medford, you'll have seen the track come through the ball square of South Medford station. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1834.884s">It's</a>  not quite all the way through the Medford Tufts University stop yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1839.829s">However,</a>  they're making progress. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1842.413s">What</a>  you also may have seen in the news in last week is that this project will be delayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1847.895s">So</a>  originally it was supposed to open in December, and we were really excited to give you a six month out update, but it turns out that the GLX constructors will be meeting with MassDOT's Physical Management Control Board on Monday, the 21st, to discuss <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1867.816s">how</a>  delayed the project actually will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1870.597s">It's</a>  no surprise that the pandemic has thrown a wrench into a number of things, lives, everything, projects, but especially the Green Line extension. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1880.856s">So</a>  while they were lucky to have purchased a majority of materials ahead of time, it's the actual manufacturing of the materials and then getting it to us here in Medford that is on delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1894.068s">Those</a>  folks that live along the project will notice that the sound walls are not complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1899.813s">The</a>  sound walls will not be complete now. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1901.834s">They're</a>  saying it's a late August. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1904.677s">And</a>  that we're really taking most dates as a to be determined date. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1910.632s">As</a>  you may remember, the project itself has very strict rules that it has to be finished in December of 2021, or the contractors themselves are not just penalized a per day penalty, but they're forbidden to work on any federal contracts until they complete the project. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1931.353s">I'm</a>  assuming that within the MBTA and the contractors, they're trying to find a solution to this issue because clearly we're not the only construction project that is delayed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1940.58s">However,</a>  we'll know more on Monday. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1943.983s">The</a>  rest of the project here at Boston College Avenue or the Medford Tufts stop has been the slowest one to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1953.67s">We're</a>  very far behind most of the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1956.308s">If</a>  you're interested in seeing what the project will look like, mostly finished, check out Union Square in Somerville. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1962.61s">Also,</a>  the Lechmere stop is phenomenal to take a look at. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1966.572s">They've</a>  relocated the station quite clearly across the street, away from the old station, and the art is installed on the elevator shafts. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1976.975s">Here</a>  at Midford and Tufts station, you'll see that two elevator shafts have been installed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1985.083s">Also,</a>  the platform has been poured and that is curing now. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1989.448s">The</a>  retaining wall is up and you'll see the black wire fence along the back. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1996.054s">The</a>  next things that have to happen are the emergency egress path has to be built along to Boston Avenue, and the pedestrian bridge from College Avenue across to Boston Avenue, where the T station is, has finally been placed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2013.766s">It's</a>  not permanent. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2014.747s">It's</a>  not situated. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2015.708s">It's</a>  definitely not open. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2018.149s">There's</a>  a number of traffic considerations that people should be aware of in this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2022.906s">College</a>  Avenue coming up from George Street to Boston Avenue is down to one lane for pedestrians, so you'll have to walk on one side of the street if you want to be a pedestrian and be safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2036.911s">It's</a>  pretty dangerous right now for cyclists, so everyone should be really aware. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2040.653s">The</a>  street has bumped out, sorry, construction has bumped out into the street, so there's no breakdown lane or sidewalk again coming up most of College Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2050.192s">We</a>  make that right turn onto Boston Avenue, heading toward Winthrop and Tamper and Hillside Hardware. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2058.158s">At</a>  least half of Boston Avenue is also now constrained and restricted. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2062.862s">So</a>  there's no sidewalk access, no bike lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2066.304s">So</a>  again, cyclists should be very careful as well as pedestrians in that area. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2070.467s">The</a>  intersection at College and Boston Avenue is also restricted. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2074.39s">So</a>  you can't get there from here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2078.75s">cross</a>  the intersection in a very specific way. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2083.032s">I</a>  think that's about it for this particular station stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2086.314s">Again,</a>  we'll know more about how delayed the project is on Monday.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2092.738s">Thank</a>  you, Laurel.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2095.2s">Senior</a>  Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2096.76s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2098.001s">That</a>  was an excellent update and I appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2102.043s">My</a>  question is, the T will not open unless the sound walls are completed, correct?</p>

    <p>[Ruma]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2110.649s">Um,</a>  well, yes.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2113.751s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2114.672s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2115.412s">So</a>  what's correct?</p>

    <p>[Ruma]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2119.155s">No,</a>  you're right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2119.675s">They</a>  can't access the walls until they have to install all the walls first before the <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2128.565s">this</a>  particular phase is complete. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2130.786s">So</a>  there will be, as far as we've been told, parts of the construction still happening once the trains are running, but most likely not the walls unless that construction is so delayed, but we're assuming not.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2146.929s">So</a>  residents that abut the tracks could rest assure more or less that the sound walls, which I know they're going to depend on, will be up when this project is underway. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2159.184s">So</a>  that's all that's going to happen.</p>

    <p>[Jim Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2161.866s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2163.167s">We've</a>  been notifying folks along the right-of-way in those three streets, Granville, Morton, and New Bern as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2170.733s">They're</a>  well aware of the delay. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2171.854s">They're</a>  a little frustrated by the process, but again, because of COVID, the supply chain delay has been in place.</p>

    <p>[Ruma]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2180.001s">And</a>  there's also parts of the wall that are not finished along Breguet and up to Brookings as well.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2187.223s">Okay,</a>  and do we have any update on the naming of the station that would be Ball Square South Method Station?</p>

    <p>[Jim Silva]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2197.047s">The</a>  only update we can tell you is what we have within the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2203.511s">It</a>  is in there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2204.532s">Senator</a>  Jalen included that information in the budget for the T budget for 2022, as well as in the house bill. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2212.256s">So</a>  both of those bills are going to the governor's office after they come out of committee. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2215.919s">Sometime</a>  in July, we'll know.</p>

    <p>[Ruma]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2219.321s">Would</a>  it be helpful? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2220.101s">It</a>  took pressure from our state officials, apologies. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2223.543s">It</a>  took pressure from the state officials <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2226.575s">as</a>  well as the city council, as well as both mayors from Medford and Somerville, as well as other representatives in Somerville to actually have the tea. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2238.633s">fall</a>  through with our request from 2019 to actually change the, to ensure the name of the Ball Square stations, Ball Square slash South Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2247.298s">We're</a>  really emphasizing this here because it's important as we all know for wayfaring and also to clarify that Medford does have two station stops. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2257.264s">It's</a>  not just Ball Square Somerville, it's also Medford as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2261.707s">So</a>  the, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2264.145s">T</a>  had released a map that showed Ball Square would only be named Ball Square, and it was only with the pressure from the elected officials did it actually get into the budget, therefore advised the T to change the name to Ball Square Self-Member.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2280.974s">That's</a>  great. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2281.574s">That</a>  pressure started largely in part because you and Jim shaking the tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2286.997s">So</a>  that was extremely helpful. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2289.159s">I'm</a>  glad to hear that it's incorporated in <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2292.813s">the</a>  budgets at the Statehouse. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2295.034s">Just</a>  a last point, Mr. President, I know we've all stated this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2298.577s">I</a>  think Jim and Laurel are probably the longest serving volunteers on a project in this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2309.205s">And</a>  the amount of hours, the time, the effort <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2312.793s">As</a>  you can hear, they sound like they're city employees. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2316.955s">They</a>  sound like they're the engineers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2319.195s">It's</a>  really remarkable what two volunteers have done in this community, Jim Silver and Wal Ruma. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2325.818s">And</a>  we can't say enough thank you, because if they weren't at every meeting and at the table, I think much of this would have gone unnoticed, and many of the improvements we're seeing wouldn't have taken place, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2338.482s">If</a>  they weren't actively out there, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2341.266s">and</a>  looking out for the best interest of our residents and our community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2344.849s">So</a>  on behalf of the council, I want to personally thank them both for their extended service on this committee, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2352.855s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2353.675s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Marks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2354.676s">Councilor</a>  Best. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2355.397s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2356.958s">I</a>  just want to echo Councilor Marks, Councilor Morell, and thanking you, Jim and Laurel, for your service. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2363.403s">I</a>  think it's really exciting news for South Medford that that name change will be in the budget, both the House and the Senate. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2369.992s">which</a>  is just great news, so thank you again.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2372.633s">Thank</a>  you, any further comment? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2376.174s">And</a>  again, I'm personally, Jim Amaro, thank you very much for all you do for us, thank you again. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2381.595s">On</a>  the motion by Councilor Morell, seconded by? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2384.056s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Falco, all in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2387.677s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2388.197s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2389.078s">2-1,</a>  4-1-0 offered by Vice President Knight and Councilor Falco, where is? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2397.297s">The</a>  privately owned and operated housing development located at 99 Riverside Avenue provides 200 affordable housing units to senior citizens and disabled Methodist residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2408.225s">And</a>  whereas the operations of 99 Riverside Avenue are not regulated by the Methodist Housing Authority. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2415.03s">And</a>  whereas between June 5th and June 9th, outdoor temperatures exceeded 90 degrees, yet the air conditioning in the building was not activated by the manager. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2426.122s">Be</a>  it so resolved that the Medford City Council authorize the city clerk to forward correspondence to the management company of 99 Riverside Avenue, requesting an explanation and citing council concern regarding public health, safety risks associated with senior citizens and disabled persons being preventably subjected to excessive exposure to extreme heat. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2451.731s">Vice</a>  President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2455.132s">Councilor</a>  Bacow.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2456.258s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2457.058s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2459.299s">Received</a>  numerous calls regarding this issue and would like to receive a response from the management company with an explanation, basically an explanation of what happened and a timeline as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2470.903s">This</a>  is a very dangerous situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2473.764s">As</a>  we know, there are many seniors that lived in that building and many people were negatively impacted by the excessive heat. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2481.026s">And</a>  we wanna make sure of course that this is, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2484.543s">you</a>  know, prevent it and it doesn't happen again. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2486.544s">So</a>  I just want to get an update from the management company to actually find out exactly what happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2494.289s">So</a>  if we could do that, I'd greatly appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2497.731s">And</a>  also we can also get a, actually if we can amend it to see what measures we're taking from the board of health with regard to the residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2507.436s">I</a>  know that cooling stations, I believe were opened, but I believe it was opened <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2511.273s">They</a>  were open on the Monday after this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2513.533s">And</a>  if this happened on a Friday, why was there a delay? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2517.114s">The</a>  city should have stepped in to make sure that our residents are safe. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2521.215s">And</a>  cooling stations are great, but they need to be open. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2525.536s">And</a>  they need to be open at hours when people need them as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2528.717s">And</a>  in some instances, an instance like this, this was a really serious situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2533.678s">It's</a>  a situation that's probably 24-7. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2535.918s">Some</a>  people can't live in that excessive heat. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2540.538s">So</a>  I would like to amend that to get more information from the airport to help. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2544.463s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2545.004s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2545.825s">Vice</a>  President Knight.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2546.726s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2548.088s">And</a>  I thank you, Councilor Falco, for partnering with me on this resolution. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2551.613s">When</a>  we think about the dangers, this is really a public safety and a public health issue, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2557.956s">200</a>  residents, 200 of our most vulnerable residents in this community, senior citizens and disabled on fixed incomes living in public housing, who are afforded an amenity, an amenity of air conditioning that the management company is not turning on during a heat wave. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2572.367s">It</a>  creates a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2573.408s">You</a>  know, when you go in that building and we've all been in there campaigning, we've all been in there dropping off flyers and shaking hands and meeting people, you see the population that lives in that building, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2583.537s">You</a>  know, you see the ride pulling up in front and taking people to doctor's appointments. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2589.041s">You</a>  see greater Lansing services pulling up and taking people to doctor's appointments, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2594.746s">So</a>  when you look at the population that's serviced there and you look at the action or lack thereof, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2599.8s">of</a>  our border health and ensuring that these residents are going to be provided with the amenities that are necessary and outlined in the HUD contract. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2607.083s">I</a>  think that that's very troubling, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2609.704s">And</a>  I thank Councilor Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2611.425s">I</a>  thank Councilor Farquhar again for partnering with me on this agenda item. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2615.287s">And</a>  I hope that my council colleagues will support it and move forward and get some questions answered, Mr. President, because ultimately it's a head scratcher to me as to why we know that the air conditioning isn't going to be online, the cooling stations aren't open for the senior citizens that are directly across the street. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2629.902s">So</a>  with that being said, I asked my council colleagues for the support of this resolution.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_16]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2634.083s">Any</a>  further questions? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2635.964s">Councilor</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2636.504s">I</a>  think this is something that needs a little more teeth. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2644.966s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2645.286s">I</a>  think this needs a little more teeth than just an explanation from the management company. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2652.328s">I</a>  think this is where our state administration has to take a lead, whether it's with the Board of Health, the building code, the building department, or <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2659.902s">code</a>  enforcement or the city solicitor. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2662.583s">So</a>  I'd like to make an amendment that I think that not only through, from what I heard is that there are certain a timeline when these certain buildings, and I think that all our assisted living buildings should have some sort of protection with the city administration, whether which department to be, but my amendment would be that they would look at not just the heat, but excessive cold, that there are certain timelines when they, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2689.605s">they</a>  look to turn these air conditioners or the heating systems on. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2693.828s">But</a>  as you can see in New England weather and what we're seeing in different, we'll have days of 35 degrees one day, another day we'll have 90 degrees. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2702.474s">So</a>  I think we have to have a way or we have to have an assistance here in the city of Medford where our city administration involved working with these assisted living homes where we're protecting our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2714.723s">And</a>  I think that from what I gathered, it was probably the most terrific <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2719.689s">situation</a>  where you're stuck on the fifth floor and there's no heat. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2724.511s">I</a>  mean, there's no air conditioning that it was oppressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2726.872s">So,</a>  which is dangerous for our residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2729.393s">So</a>  I appreciate Councilor Falco, Councilor Knight bringing this forward, but I think we need to make, I'd like to amend this at the city administration and city solicitor's office, whether it be the code enforcement officer or the health department, that we implement a regulation that when, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2749.295s">cases</a>  of certain heat or cold, that we make sure that by code or by law, by ordinance, that we're taking steps to make sure we're protecting our residents.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2760.163s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2763.286s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2764.227s">If</a>  I may add to Councilor Scarpelli's point, I believe the private management company had said the state law says we have to give them heat till June 15th. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2773.213s">So</a>  we couldn't turn on the air conditioning. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2775.695s">I</a>  think maybe <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2777.493s">I</a>  think we've heard before from this administration that they've advocated with the state to change rules that they felt were affecting safety when it came to nursing homes and COVID. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2786.175s">I</a>  think as part of Councilor Scarpelli's amendment, they should go to the state and say, why is this based on the arbitrary June 15th and not based on the temperature at the time? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2795.198s">You</a>  should be able to have air conditioning when it's 90 degrees or heat when it's 30 degrees, whether it's June 12th or December 12th, it doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2803.8s">So</a>  I think that should be a part <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2806.522s">of</a>  this as well, is that the administration should go to the state and say, if it's not a local ordinance question and it's a state law, that law needs to be adjusted so that we're not in this situation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2816.289s">Because</a>  I believe the problem ended up being fixed on a Tuesday. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2820.412s">That</a>  was four or five days of 90 degree heat until the problem was fixed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2824.515s">So</a>  it needs to be done in a much more timely manner going forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2827.877s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2828.618s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2831.059s">I</a>  want to thank Vice President Knight and Councilor Falco for bringing this forward, as well as my <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2835.625s">fellow</a>  Councilors for their amendments and particularly Councilor Scarpelli for really raising the issue of volatility in the weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2842.429s">You</a>  know, one thing with climate change, we know we're going to have these more volatile patterns and also we're going to have an increase in above 90 degree days. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2850.297s">than</a>  we historically have had. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2851.578s">So</a>  I think as mentioned also by Councilor Bears, these arbitrary timelines or dates are really putting people in danger and not serving the people that I think perhaps they were originally designed to protect. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2862.904s">So</a>  I support the council action on this and really appreciate the efforts to make sure we're protecting our residents.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2870.768s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Morell. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2872.569s">Seeing</a>  Councilor Baxton.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2874.55s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2875.751s">And</a>  I wanna thank again Councilor <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2878.845s">Falco</a>  and Vice President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2882.026s">This</a>  is common every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2885.247s">We</a>  go through this every year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2887.848s">Some</a>  years we're lucky because we don't have a heat wave until well after the middle of June, but this year we faced a heat wave at the beginning of June, an extended heat wave. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2901.954s">The</a>  issue to me is that whether it's a management company or whether it's Method Housing, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2908.993s">If</a>  a temperature rises above a certain degree, Mr. President, and from what I read in the paper, that some of these units were upwards of 85 to 90 degrees. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2920.041s">You</a>  can imagine being in a unit, 85 or 90 degrees, when you open a window and get zero breeze, Mr. President, or you put on a fan and all you're doing is blowing around the 90 degree heat in a unit, that creates heat exhaustion. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2935.545s">And</a>  if you have comorbidities, like many seniors do, and disabled in our community, that could be a very serious combination. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2944.071s">Very</a>  serious combination. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2946.392s">And</a>  at the very least, Mr. President, and Councilor Farquhar will hit the nail on the head, the city was slow to operate the cooling stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2955.058s">It</a>  was two days into the heat wave. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2958.545s">that</a>  the city sent out a call saying there was the availability of cooling stations. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2965.35s">Also,</a>  some of the cooling stations, as Councilor Falco alluded to, had hours that were, you know, bankers hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2973.917s">So</a>  I guess you can't overheat at nine o'clock at night if it's 90 degrees, and you have nowhere to go, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2981.403s">But</a>  at the very least, Mr. President, these particular buildings should be equipped <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2987.888s">like</a>  emergency management should be in this community, which I have to say, emergency management in this community does not exist. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2997.695s">It's</a>  non-existent. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=2999.136s">So</a>  if we depend on emergency management during a true emergency, we're in trouble in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3006.621s">We</a>  can't even attend to one building. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3010.464s">What</a>  should have happened is portable AC units should have been immediately deployed in that particular building. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3018.788s">immediately.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3019.969s">Every</a>  room should have been checked. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3023.311s">Every</a>  room should have been checked. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3026.652s">And</a>  if we weren't able to get the portable AC systems, they should have contacted the hotel across the street or the hotels in Wellington and put people up for the night or two nights. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3039.72s">What's</a>  more important? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3043.562s">It</a>  was totally mishandled, Mr. President, and it's unacceptable. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3048.509s">and</a>  we're not prepared as a community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3051.794s">This</a>  is a shot across the bow for this administration and previous administrations. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3059.191s">because</a>  it's a show of a program. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3061.112s">When</a>  we go through our budget, and when the council sees a budget for $450 for a city of 58,000 people, Mr. President, you're going to say, what type of emergency management are you going to provide to us, to the seniors, to families? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3077.939s">God</a>  forbid a true emergency would happen in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3083.261s">The</a>  way they address the pandemic, we hear all sorts of accolades. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3088.665s">That</a>  should also be the way we address a situation like we had last week, Mr. President, with the heat wave. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3095.447s">That</a>  should kick into effect with the Board of Health and emergency management. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3102.188s">Did</a>  we hear about any emergency management? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3106.229s">Did</a>  the residents hear about any emergency management? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3110.23s">No,</a>  they had to wait for a newspaper to write an article. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3114.351s">It's</a>  unacceptable, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3116.175s">It</a>  really is. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3117.075s">And</a>  this has been going on for years. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3118.716s">It's</a>  not just this administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3120.936s">When</a>  are we going to get serious with emergency management in this community? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3126.917s">When</a>  are we going to have someone head emergency management? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3129.738s">When</a>  are we going to fully fund it? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3132.919s">It</a>  hasn't happened to date. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3134.859s">And</a>  this budget is no different. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3137.559s">Last</a>  year, apparently we had the perfect budget and we got accolades for having the perfect budget and mechanically, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3145.034s">Maybe</a>  it was the perfect budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3146.496s">Maybe</a>  it was written up and it looked great and had a great cover on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3151.382s">But</a>  it's the substance that matters, what's inside the budget. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3154.786s">And</a>  we sorely underfund emergency management. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3158.171s">No</a>  one wants to talk about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3160.153s">We</a>  sorely underfund it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3161.675s">And</a>  when it comes up, Mr. President, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3163.988s">I'm</a>  going to be the first to shake the tree once again and find out why we're not fully funding emergency management, why we don't have a full time dedicated person. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3173.837s">This</a>  is not something you give someone a $500 stipend and say, Hey, here's your hat. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3178.501s">You're</a>  in charge of emergency management for the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3182.344s">There's</a>  grant funding out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3183.665s">We're</a>  not taking advantage of this programs out there that we could take advantage of. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3190.57s">There's</a>  companies that will come in and provide services at very little to no cost. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3196.374s">But</a>  you have to ask. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3197.615s">You</a>  have to have someone in charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3200.537s">And</a>  it's not happening in this community, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3203.379s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3203.939s">And</a>  I thank my colleagues for bringing this up.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3205.941s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3209.083s">Mary</a>  Ann Broxton has your hand up. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3211.384s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, are you in? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3212.465s">Mary</a>  Ann?</p>

    <p>[Broxton]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3216.548s">Hi,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Broxton]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3219.767s">Maryam</a>  rocks in exchange of, and I appreciate your, um, the topic of emergency management and just, I would just like to add to that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3227.872s">If</a>  we're talking about emergency management, we should also have an emergency room in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3233.016s">A</a>  hospital that has a functioning emergency room. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3237.359s">As</a>  if the people that were at 99, the elderly residents that were there at the apartment building, they got heat stroke. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3243.803s">What</a>  emergency room would they have been taken to? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3246.385s">We</a>  don't have an operating hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3248.961s">with</a>  a hospital with an operating emergency room in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3252.444s">That</a>  should be something else we talk about when we talk about emergency management and heat. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3257.588s">So</a>  that's it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3259.249s">That's</a>  my statement.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3260.13s">The</a>  council pushed to save that emergency room and it was out of our control, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3264.834s">This</a>  council didn't support saving that emergency room. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3267.556s">You</a>  are correct.</p>

    <p>[Broxton]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3268.657s">Is</a>  there a way that we can bring one back?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3271.359s">I</a>  would tend to doubt it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3275.602s">You</a>  can't have an emergency room without a hospital. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3278.458s">So</a>  unfortunately the hospital's gone and to have an emergency room that can't provide services would be a detriment to the safety of the public. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3289.147s">So</a>  on the motion by Vice President Knight and Councilor Falco as amended by Councilor Falco and Councilor Scott Felly, seconded by Councilor Meares.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3302.698s">I</a>  didn't put mine in the form of a motion, but I'd like to put mine in the form of a motion regarding <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3308.367s">the</a>  budget and the lack of funding in this community for emergency preparedness. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3315.371s">I'd</a>  like to get a response back from the city administration. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3317.812s">How</a>  they're going to increase the emergency preparedness and awareness in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3324.976s">And</a>  also that if this ever happens again in this community, that portable air conditioning units, as well as putting people up in hotels, Mr. President, and public housing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3336.372s">or</a>  in private, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3338.773s">They're</a>  making money hand over fist in these private buildings, and they should take care of their residents. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3346.135s">So</a>  I would ask that that be part of the report as well.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3348.995s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3350.036s">On</a>  the motion by Vice President Knight, Councilor Belco, second as, that's a B paper. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3358.878s">So</a>  on the B paper, as offered by Councilor Locke, seconded by Vice President Knight, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3366.482s">All</a>  those in favor? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3367.582s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3368.022s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3369.303s">On</a>  the original motion offered by Vice President Knight and Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Scarpelli and Councilor Falco, seconded by?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3405.282s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3407.483s">Oh,</a>  all those in favor. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3409.143s">Aye.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3409.403s">Motion</a>  passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3410.163s">2-1-4-1-1</a>  offered by Councilor Scarpelli, be it resolved that the Medford City Council express its sincere condolences to the family of former athletic director, teacher, coach, and Method legend, Francis Bud Kelly, on his recent passing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3425.86s">Dr.</a>  Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Scarpelli]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3427.281s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3429.762s">When</a>  I heard this news Friday morning, it was probably one of the toughest days because Buddy Kelly's played such a positive impact in my life and thousands of other residents here in the city of Medford and outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3444.471s">First</a>  to his family, his wife, Judy, who stood beside him through two bouts of cancer. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3452.578s">and</a>  the most awful fifth stage of Parkinson's disease. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3456.719s">And</a>  his loving children, Beth, Judy, and Linda, who were there every step of the way for their dad. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3465.662s">From</a>  what I hear, the last few months spent every single evening with him, making sure mom had the assistance that buddy's independence required. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3478.747s">When</a>  I say this, I say this too often, maybe it starts to sound a little corny, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3483.085s">This</a>  is happening too often when legends are leaving us here in Metro. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3487.568s">And</a>  I thought of Buddy the other day and yesterday when we see our city going through a pretty tough time and it's so divided. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3495.712s">And</a>  Buddy would be the type of person, no matter what race or gender, sexual orientation, what religion, your height, your color hair, or if you had no hair. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3508.96s">He's</a>  the type of person that <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3511.165s">would</a>  find that bond to bring everybody together. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3514.226s">And</a>  that's what I think we miss here right now in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3518.687s">And</a>  what I'm talking about is if you grew up in Medford and if you didn't grow up in Medford, you should learn about this because Buddy taught me some important lessons in life. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3528.77s">I</a>  learned them in my home about loyalty and commitment and pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3533.691s">And</a>  that's in your home. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3534.531s">That's</a>  instilled in you by your mom and dad and your family, you hope. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3537.992s">But</a>  Buddy taught you outside the home <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3540.955s">is</a>  what it all meant to be in Medford Mustang and be, and as he would say, blue and white, blue and white. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3551.321s">And</a>  how that blue and white flow through your veins, no matter who you were. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3554.643s">And</a>  it was funny as I read posts and talked to alumni and, you know, Krista McCormick, a legendary basketball player, captain of UMaine when I played professionally, she called us and she sent the message and said, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3569.336s">But</a>  he was so amazing that he was the person back in the day that said to the girls' basketball program, to the boys' basketball program, hold on a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3578.164s">The</a>  boys don't get the glass. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3580.306s">The</a>  girls can shoot on that same glass the day before game day. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3584.249s">So</a>  he changed the rule. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3587.712s">And</a>  he made sure that everybody felt comfortable in Medford High School. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3591.455s">He</a>  had his own way, but his way was the Mustang way. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3595.719s">He</a>  brought everybody together. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3599.322s">And</a>  I'm going to miss him greatly because he did instill in me as a young coach and a young man what it was and why we live in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3608.449s">Because</a>  truly, whether you're here a day or whether you're here for 35 years, you're here for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3615.133s">You</a>  moved here for a reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3616.754s">You're</a>  brought here for a reason because you love the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3621.558s">And</a>  if we can get back to what Buddy taught us for so many years and taught so many people that <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3629.592s">let</a>  the blue and white overcome everything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3633.753s">And</a>  you could see amazing things happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3637.874s">Like</a>  I said, last couple of nights, I've been thinking about buddy and seeing what our city is going through. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3642.715s">And</a>  that analogy just came to me because it really meant a lot to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3646.136s">That's</a>  the type of person that brought me into coaching. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3649.697s">That's</a>  the type of person that when you sit in a locker room with my teams, that it wasn't about the win or the loss. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3657.279s">It</a>  was about being a Mustang. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3658.912s">and</a>  loving the blue and white and loving the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3662.253s">And</a>  somewhere along the line, we forgot that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3665.494s">And</a>  I'd be remiss to say that if it wasn't for Buddy Kelly, I don't know if my life would ever be the same. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3671.437s">He</a>  taught me so much and I'm gonna miss him forever.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3709.475s">Thank</a>  you, Councilor Villescaz. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3710.335s">Vice</a>  President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3712.196s">Mr.</a>  President, thank you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3714.298s">I</a>  can't remember a time in my life that Bud Kelly wasn't a part of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3718.56s">uh,</a>  his nephew, David and I were best buddies. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3721.222s">We</a>  met the first day of school in first grade. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3723.563s">And,</a>  um, throughout high school, I had the opportunity to work in buddy Kelly's office at this great thing meant that I had, it was called office assignments. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3731.308s">And,</a>  um, every fifth and sixth period for my junior and senior year, I spent that in Mr. Kelly's office, uh, working with him, putting together the athletic schedules. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3739.534s">Not</a>  really. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3740.426s">Um,</a>  it was more or less collecting equipment and making sure it was clean and, uh, you know, counting jock straps and shoulder pads. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3747.027s">So</a>  it was really what we did, but, um, but it was a great guy and, um, I wouldn't have gotten through high school if it weren't for buddy. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3753.249s">Um,</a>  I played lacrosse at Medford high and, uh, throughout my four years at Medford high, we had four different coaches and every year they tried to eliminate the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3761.63s">And,</a>  um, I'd always go into buddy's office and I. Begging plead for him not to eliminate the program. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3766.652s">So</a>  it'll be a keep lacrosse program alive for another year. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3769.386s">And,</a>  you know, we still have that program today. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3771.827s">And</a>  it was because of Buddy. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3773.408s">Buddy,</a>  listen, listen to the kids. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3776.31s">Tried</a>  to provide a service, but he was a great man. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3778.291s">He</a>  was a great coach, Baldwin Catholic High School, Hall of Famer, Manfred High School, Hall of Famer. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3784.614s">Someone</a>  who always spoke about the blue and white, but it was always a little secret that he kept that he was actually a Baldwin Catholic graduate. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3790.897s">You</a>  know, his sister, Patricia and Brenna Deck, the twins, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3795.326s">very</a>  close friends of the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3796.526s">And</a>  I just want to offer them my condolences. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3798.967s">It</a>  was a very tough, tough way to go this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3802.248s">And</a>  I stand by my council colleagues and in all the time words that they have about Mr. Kelly, because every single one of them is true. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3810.049s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3811.23s">Senior</a>  Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3812.61s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3813.75s">I</a>  want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for his putting this on the agenda and for also his personal words because <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3822.189s">I</a>  think his tribute really struck home with me. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3826.513s">Knowing</a>  Bud, you know, Bud was a friend to everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3831.417s">I</a>  had him a teacher when I was at the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3833.839s">He</a>  was my teacher. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3835.961s">You</a>  know, I didn't play any sports under Bud. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3838.964s">I</a>  actually wrestled for Method High School, but he was the athletic director and he cared about every program. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3845.618s">And</a>  he cared about every kid individually. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3848.56s">And</a>  he had a relationship. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3850.061s">I</a>  don't know how he did it with every kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3853.324s">And</a>  we all respected him. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3855.285s">And</a>  he was tough as nails when he had to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3857.887s">And</a>  he let you know that he was there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3860.209s">And</a>  if you did something wrong, he let you know about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3862.95s">But</a>  he also had a side that was very sensitive. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3866.273s">And</a>  Bud was truly a great family man. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3870.236s">His</a>  wife, Judy, we used to joke around, come around this time every July. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3875.632s">His</a>  wife and I would meet, and we used to meet at Stop and Shop around the cherries that came out every July, and we'd be the first in the cherry section, and we'd pick through all the cherries because we were cherry fiends. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3889.603s">And</a>  we used to laugh about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3890.944s">And</a>  they're just a great couple, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3897.289s">Bud,</a>  I think, would be the first to lend a hand, as Councilor Scarpelli mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3903.073s">If</a>  he needed something, he'd be there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3905.716s">He'd</a>  be the first to help you out. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3907.177s">He'd</a>  be the first to extend himself. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3909.679s">He'd</a>  be the first to go to bat. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3911.8s">And,</a>  you know, that's what I remember about Bud Kelly. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3914.882s">And</a>  you're absolutely right, my council colleagues, all three of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3920.606s">You</a>  know, as we lose people of this character, people that made the city what it is, Mr. President, it truly is not just the loss of someone, it's the loss of, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3934.559s">a</a>  feeling in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3936.4s">It's</a>  the loss knowing that someone has your back. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3939.44s">It's</a>  the loss of having someone that is there with your best interest. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3944.882s">And</a>  I think as we lose people like that, we really lose a part of the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3949.603s">And</a>  I'm hoping that we start to build that camaraderie. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3953.084s">We</a>  start to build that sense of neighborhood, that sense of belonging. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3959.486s">And</a>  that's what, you know, I think Bud instilled <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3963.649s">how</a>  he acted in this community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3965.531s">It</a>  really was a sense of pride. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3967.673s">And</a>  if you didn't go to the Thanksgiving football game, let me tell you, especially in the high school, you weren't getting an A or B anymore. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3976.219s">You</a>  had to go to the game and he used to take attendance, believe me. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3980.222s">And</a>  the crowds were huge because of Bud Kelly and because of the spirit and the pride that Bud Kelly had, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3987.784s">And</a>  you're absolutely right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3989.104s">The</a>  blue and white, I don't think you can meet someone that had more blue and whites with their veins. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3994.425s">Um,</a>  and he will be sorely missed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=3996.386s">I,</a>  I feel awful, uh, for, uh, Judy and, uh, Beth and, um, uh, Linda and, uh, you know, the rest of the family, um, including the son-in-laws and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4008.609s">Uh,</a>  because Bud was an excellent husband, father, grandfather, friend, coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4016.667s">You</a>  name it, he excelled at everything and found the time to do so. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4021.109s">And</a>  he will surely be missed, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4024.25s">I</a>  ask, I know my colleague would want it, that we name Bud Kelly, dedicate this meeting after Bud Kelly in all his years of service, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4035.595s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4038.176s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4042.398s">I</a>  had the honor to play football for Bud Kelly <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4046.025s">from</a>  1985, 1986, and 1987. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4047.206s">And</a>  I remember as a sophomore coming to Medford High School and being on the varsity team, it was quite intimidating. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4057.07s">You</a>  had a lot of juniors and seniors that played. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4062.312s">It</a>  was a great team in 1985. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4063.472s">He</a>  was the head coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4067.134s">But</a>  coming in as a sophomore, everyone at this council was really hit upon it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4072.016s">It</a>  was family. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4072.869s">You</a>  came in, it didn't matter where you came from. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4074.871s">It</a>  didn't matter who you were, you were family. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4077.694s">And</a>  he preached that repeatedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4080.296s">And</a>  it was about, you know, family, loyalty, being together, having fun, but also being serious too. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4089.405s">When</a>  he had to be tough, he was tough, but he was fair. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4092.868s">He</a>  was fair with everyone. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4095.871s">It</a>  was probably one of the, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4098.567s">You</a>  think about, you know, you play sports, you're part of clubs or groups. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4101.429s">And</a>  it was probably one of the most fun moments of my life, you know, young life growing up, being 15 years old and being part of that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4109.096s">And,</a>  uh, you know, he was the last coach to win a GBL title in football. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4113.94s">It's</a>  been quite some time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4114.98s">It's</a>  been, uh, almost 30 years now, actually more than 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4119.284s">Uh,</a>  but he was, uh, he was, you know, I remember seeing him after graduating and going to high school games, you'd see him as the AD then. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4127.331s">And,</a>  uh, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4128.463s">He</a>  was just a great guy, always a good friend, and someone who could really make you laugh. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4134.947s">And,</a>  you know, he was a great family man. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4136.688s">I</a>  remember those games in 1985. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4138.229s">After</a>  we won, we'd always drive through Medford Square, pull up on the bus, and I think his wife worked at the dress shop right behind City Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4146.994s">And</a>  he'd stop the bus after every win, and everybody would be singing the Mustang Spice Song, and traffic would come to a stop. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4155.907s">And</a>  literally he'd get out of the bus, he'd run across the street, his wife would come out and everybody that worked at the shop and he'd give his wife a kiss. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4162.81s">And</a>  then he'd come back onto the bus and we'd make our way to the high school. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4166.892s">And,</a>  uh, you know, it was just a really fun way to celebrate a victory. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4170.954s">He</a>  was a great family man. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4172.194s">And,</a>  uh, there was a lot of pride there in blue and white. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4176.817s">If</a>  you play Mustang football, blue and white was running through your veins. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4179.878s">If</a>  you played any sport, blue and white was running through your veins and he would preach that repeatedly. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4184.999s">And,</a>  you know, the community is, this is a big loss to the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4189.463s">And</a>  my, you know, thoughts and prayers and condolences go to the Kelly, to Judy Kelly and the family. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4194.627s">And</a>  he will, he will be missed.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4196.588s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4198.91s">And</a>  on behalf of myself and my family, I knew Bud for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4203.494s">He,</a>  I had the opportunity to get to know him on a different level because he coached with my uncle for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4211.44s">Councilor</a>  Marks is right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4213.387s">Thanksgiving</a>  Day, God couldn't get into the home of the stadium. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4217.409s">He</a>  didn't have a ticket. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4218.789s">Sold</a>  out every year for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4221.31s">And</a>  he used to chastise me because I didn't play football. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4225.071s">He</a>  says, big guy like you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4230.173s">He</a>  said, I want you on the team. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4233.535s">I</a>  did play one year as a freshman year, but that was about it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4236.496s">But</a>  I knew Bud for many, many years. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4238.257s">And</a>  he was part of the Super Bowl winning staff there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4242.331s">I</a>  think there's only one person left, that whole Super Bowl coaching staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4249.953s">And</a>  like Councilor Scott probably said, men and women who have blue and white in their veins, they're dying quickly. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4261.897s">And</a>  they're not, people just aren't stepping up to the degree that those people did. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4270.458s">and</a>  there's a void in the community when another person passes on. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4274.181s">So</a>  again, to the Bud and his family, my condolences. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4278.824s">So</a>  if we could rise for a moment of silence, please. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4299.077s">Mr.</a>  Clerk, could you please call the roll?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4465.013s">Questions</a>  for the gentleman. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4466.894s">Mr.</a>  President, I actually had the opportunity of speaking with Mr. Tallman earlier, having some familiarity with the ongoings at Hormel Stadium in the rental of the fields. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4476.418s">The</a>  history of Ultimate Frisbee in Medford is actually pretty strong and pretty proud. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4482.341s">Just</a>  a couple of years ago, I do remember the Boston Whitecaps, I think was the name of the team that was competing in the national championship and were actually on ESPN's top 10 at Hormel Stadium. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4493.747s">So</a>  they certainly do bring some interest to the area and certainly some bodies to the region. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4499.151s">And</a>  I, for one, have no concerns supporting the Sausage Guys, Sausage Cat down at Hormel Stadium for these dates that have been selected. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4507.979s">So</a>  with that being said, Mr. President, I certainly would move for approval on item one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4512.523s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4516.04s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4516.661s">Thank</a>  you for your presentation. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4518.904s">Quick</a>  question, you said there were 22 teams in the league? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4521.367s">22</a>  teams in the league. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4522.128s">And</a>  where are they from?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4523.389s">All</a>  over the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4524.31s">So</a>  there's three teams, two teams in California, as far south as Florida and Texas. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4532.716s">Minnesota,</a>  Chicago, Detroit, pretty much all the major hubs. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4536.26s">So</a>  Boston was their last piece, Seattle, Boston, they've wanted a Boston team since the former league folded. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4543.349s">And</a>  we got a couple of investors, including myself, and here we are. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4547.554s">Great.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4548.135s">And</a>  how long is your season? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4549.396s">How</a>  many games do you play at home?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4550.496s">So</a>  normally we, the season stretches from the spring to the mid-summer, but because of COVID, we're now playing throughout the summer. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4557.839s">So</a>  we'll be at Hormel through August. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4559.94s">And</a>  if we make the playoffs, maybe one game beyond that at Hormel, if we have a favorable record.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4565.783s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4566.223s">And</a>  I'm sorry, how many, how many games do you play?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4568.504s">We</a>  play 12 total regular season games. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4570.925s">And</a>  then there's playoffs after that.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4573.643s">It's</a>  pretty exciting. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4574.344s">Thank</a>  you very much. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4575.144s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4576.105s">What</a>  I've seen before is that a city clerk is an ultimate frisbee. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4580.729s">Perfect.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4581.509s">Our</a>  own professional, I guess.</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4583.471s">I've</a>  been playing in a pickup league that's been in existence up at Carr Park for more than 30 years. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4588.815s">I've</a>  been playing with them for nine. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4593.739s">You</a>  might have to take five of our teams to scrimmage once. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4600.022s">Scrimmage</a>  against yours, that might give us some sort of advantage if we had five teams and you had one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4604.544s">But</a>  as you know, you know how much fun it is.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4625.94s">Okay,</a>  so we wanna vote on these separately. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4628.441s">We</a>  have a second one here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4629.722s">Is</a>  the petitioner here for the second application? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4632.483s">Yes,</a>  the Dunkin' Donuts is here for the second one also.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_14]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4635.324s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4635.905s">Hey,</a>  thank you so much. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4636.905s">I</a>  appreciate it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4637.926s">Hope</a>  to see you all at a game. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4639.306s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4639.666s">Yeah,</a>  thank you.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4640.987s">Number</a>  two, Kefauver Management Company, LLC, Dunkin' Donuts location. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4646.67s">Start</a>  dates expected June 28th, 2021, 283 Middlesex Ave, Medford, August 2nd. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4654.453s">2021</a>  7 Commercial Street, Medford, and 283, 283 Mystic Avenue, Medford, and 7 Commercial Street, Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4665.28s">I</a>  see the representative of Declan Donovan is here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4667.381s">Name</a>  and address of the record, please.</p>

    <p>[_tT-sIarT8Q_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4668.682s">Hi,</a>  Emily Fitzgerald, 280 Merrimack Street, Methuen, Massachusetts.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4673.624s">Can</a>  you give us a little brief update on what's going on and how long you've been needing these trucks for?</p>

    <p>[_tT-sIarT8Q_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4681.893s">So</a>  during those two weeks listed, we will be remodeling those Dunkin' Donuts locations to the next gen image. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4689.934s">We</a>  like to use our dunking cart to make up for a loss of sales and hopefully not any loss of customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4698.376s">We've</a>  had much success using this cart in other remodels in New York and Maine, and we are hoping to keep it going with a limited menu and limited hours. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4710.721s">So</a>  we're hopeful.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4711.982s">Okay,</a>  question to the petitioner. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4716.565s">Vice</a>  President Knight. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4719.468s">I'm</a>  not understanding this, so would it be located at the physical location of the store, just outside? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4726.473s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[_tT-sIarT8Q_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4728.174s">Yes,</a>  so it's a cart, it's more of a trailer, it's enclosed, and then that's where the coffee and muffins are served to the customers. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4740.073s">and</a>  it's just going to carry on just like a drive-through. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4743.336s">The</a>  stations are positioned within the drive-through in the parking lot, so the traffic flow is the exact same. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4751.182s">You</a>  come in, you stop at the tent, you order, you pull up to the cart, you get your coffee, your donut, whatever it may be, and you exit.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4761.691s">Do</a>  you have an existing drive-through window at this location presently?</p>

    <p>[_tT-sIarT8Q_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4764.634s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4766.075s">I</a>  think Middlesex Avenue. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4769.104s">And</a>  commercial street as well.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4771.326s">So</a>  I get the people to go inside the restaurant to go to the drive-thru.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4774.047s">They're</a>  gonna be remodeling inside the restaurant. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4775.989s">Remodeling?</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4776.649s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4777.249s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4779.931s">Do</a>  you know how long you'll be remodeling each location?</p>

    <p>[_tT-sIarT8Q_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4785.055s">Yes,</a>  each remodel is two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4787.556s">The</a>  cart runs Monday through Friday only, both of those two weeks.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4792.259s">Two</a>  weeks at each location?</p>

    <p>[_tT-sIarT8Q_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4794.341s">Correct.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4795.301s">Will</a>  these be going on simultaneously? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4798.669s">are</a>  at different times.</p>

    <p>[_tT-sIarT8Q_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4800.27s">I'm</a>  sorry, say that again.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4801.09s">I</a>  said, well, the construction won't be going on at all these locations simultaneously or you're gonna finish on and then.</p>

    <p>[_tT-sIarT8Q_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4809.753s">No,</a>  we are starting with the Middlesex Ave location tentatively June 28th. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4814.875s">And</a>  then on August 2nd, we intend on starting seven commercial street.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4819.737s">Okay.</a> </p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4821.038s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4823.199s">Senior</a>  Councilor Baxton.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4825.18s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4827.329s">So</a>  the lot on Middlesex Ave is quite a large lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4832.915s">So</a>  I could see that working on Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4835.438s">The</a>  lot on Commercial Street is a very difficult lot to get in. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4840.664s">And</a>  I can only imagine during construction, I was just wondering if you can lay out what the plans are. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4846.711s">You</a>  said there's a tent and <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4848.39s">you</a>  know, they're going to be able to access through the tent and drive through. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4852.291s">Can</a>  you just explain, are they going to use the existing drive-through even though it's closed as a way to go in and out of that very small lot? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4861.674s">Can</a>  you just explain how it's going to work?</p>

    <p>[_tT-sIarT8Q_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4864.655s">They</a>  are going to pull in the entrance as they normally would to enter the drive-through. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4870.176s">The</a>  tent is set up right over the drive-through lane where they pull up, they enter and <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4877.003s">order</a>  through our employees and they pay under the tent, or I'm sorry, next to the tent. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4882.107s">The</a>  employees stand underneath the tent just for rain and shine. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4886.69s">Then</a>  they pull up to the cart and there's an employee standing there with their beverage, which is located right again in the drive-thru and they exit.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4896.018s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4896.618s">So</a>  part of my concern, Mr. President, and I know they're actually working on the Dunkin' Donuts on the Fellsway right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4904.824s">It's</a>  been closed for <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4906.12s">I</a>  believe two days. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4908.641s">But</a>  part of my concern is when this duck and donuts originally went in, there was some grave concern about the queuing up of cars that are going through the drive-through. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4920.186s">And</a>  the reason that was raised is we all know that engine four is next door. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4925.488s">And</a>  believe it or not, it's not unheard of. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4927.849s">I</a>  live in the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4929.194s">that</a>  on certain days, you'll see the cars queuing up onto Commercial Street and out onto Riverside Ave, and not far from the entrance to the fire station. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4942.485s">My</a>  only concern now is you're gonna be backing up where cars are gonna be coming in. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4947.249s">The</a>  tent will be right where the entrance is, I assume where the doors are, and you're gonna be backing up cars queuing onto Riverside and Commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4957.765s">And</a>  depending on the flow and so forth, I have some concern, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4963.609s">Is</a>  this something that has been run by public safety officials in the community?</p>

    <p>[_tT-sIarT8Q_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4971.353s">No.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4973.755s">Not</a>  on my behalf, no.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4976.096s">I</a>  would just respectfully ask, I'm not opposed to what they're trying to do, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4980.459s">I</a>  just want to make sure it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4983.311s">Like</a>  I said, this is a much smaller lot than Middlesex Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4986.574s">Middlesex</a>  Ave can accommodate, you know, the big Apple Circus there under a tent and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4992.317s">But</a>  Commercial Street is a congested lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=4995.439s">There's</a>  no access from Riverside Ave into their lot, either come into Commercial. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5000.903s">Getting</a>  in and out of their lot inherently is difficult already. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5005.621s">and</a>  I'm sure you would know as someone that's involved with that Dunkin Donuts, I just wanna make sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5012.104s">So</a>  I would ask that approval be conditioned upon getting approval from both the fire and police chief that they don't anticipate any concerns with public safety regarding access to our fire trucks getting in and out of engine four and also safety with the president of vehicles queuing up potentially onto Riverside Ave. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5034.167s">So</a>  that would be my recommendation, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5036.628s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5038.528s">As</a>  amended by council member. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5041.089s">Council</a>  member.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5042.429s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5043.529s">A</a>  quick question. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5044.189s">I</a>  believe, did you say there were abbreviated hours? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5048.57s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5049.751s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5050.011s">Can</a>  you just elaborate on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5052.191s">Is</a>  it the same hours for each location or does each location have different hours?</p>

    <p>[_tT-sIarT8Q_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5057.672s">Typically</a>  we run the cart from six to two in the afternoon.</p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5064.323s">That</a>  would be the same for both locations. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5067.124s">Okay,</a>  so 6 a.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5068.285s">to</a>  2 p.m. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5069.385s">for</a>  both locations for the duration of the remodel? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5074.227s">Correct.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5075.728s">I</a>  apologize, did you say the remodel was going to be two weeks?</p>

    <p>[_tT-sIarT8Q_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5080.39s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[Falco]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5083.151s">Okay,</a>  thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5084.212s">Councilor</a>  Morocco.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5085.612s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5086.293s">Councilor</a>  Fabio asked my question, so I'm all set.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5090.295s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5091.934s">How</a>  many Dunkin' Donuts locations does your management company operate or own?</p>

    <p>[_tT-sIarT8Q_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5097.977s">Entirely?</a> </p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5099.377s">Yes.</a> </p>

    <p>[_tT-sIarT8Q_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5100.738s">Just</a>  shy of 300.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5102.839s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5104.259s">And</a>  you have, you know, two locations within a pretty reasonable distance from the locations you're going to be remodeling. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5112.103s">Why</a>  not just send customers to the next closest location that you are owning?</p>

    <p>[_tT-sIarT8Q_SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5119.561s">It's</a>  really just to try to keep our customers on their same daily patterns. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5123.842s">And,</a>  you know, the customers that you go to Dunkin' Donuts on Middlesex every day, because that's the one you pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5130.784s">You</a>  don't pass the one on, say, Fells Way or whichever other road. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5138.107s">That's</a>  really, it's just to keep the same customers coming to the same location.</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5142.928s">Yeah,</a>  I personally am not in favor of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5147.109s">I</a>  think you could say <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5149.477s">Down</a>  the street is our Felsway location. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5151.418s">We'll</a>  be closed for two weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5152.478s">And</a>  if you own hundreds of Dunkin' Donuts, it doesn't seem like it would hurt the bottom line that much to me. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5158.34s">So</a>  that's where I stand on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5159.74s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5161.581s">Vice</a>  President Knight, I'm somewhat in line with what Councilor Bears is saying. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5165.562s">I</a>  mean, I just don't like the precedent it sets, and I don't really feel as though it <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5171.668s">falls</a>  in line with the intent of a food truck pilot program. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5174.41s">You</a>  know, we were talking about food trucks, we were talking about, you know, having the ability to, you know, bring the sausage guy to Hormel Stadium so that someone could have an event. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5182.294s">And</a>  I really think that, you know, remodeling the business, that's a cost of doing business. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5186.197s">And</a>  I think that the public safety concerns are going to outweigh, you know, the benefits that they're going to provide to the community, number one. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5193.121s">And</a>  number two, because it doesn't seem to really fall in line with the intent of our food truck ordinance, I'm going to have a difficult time supporting it this evening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=5200.666s">Thank</a>  you, Vice President.</p>
