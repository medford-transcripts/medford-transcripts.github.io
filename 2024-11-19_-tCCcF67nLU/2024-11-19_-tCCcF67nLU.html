    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=37.82s">Motions,</a>  orders, and resolutions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=39.783s">Paper</a>  21404, offered by President Caraviello. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=44.148s">Be</a>  it so resolved, the Medford City Council discuss the report submitted by the traffic engineer in regard to High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=50.216s">Be</a>  it further resolved, the traffic engineer and the city engineer be available to address this issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=55.501s">a</a>  council Scarpelli offered an amendment requesting that the MBTA be contacted for answers and that the MBTA representatives meet with the council and committee of the whole for further discussion. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=64.389s">Be</a>  Councilor bears off an amendment that the 710 bus be included in discussions at this meeting.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=77.303s">Because</a>  they run sort of together.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=80.126s">There</a>  are no objections. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=81.026s">Paper</a>  21407, be it so resolved, the Medford City Council go on record as informing the city administration as being opposed to the new island installation of High Street, Rubin Street, and Hastings Lane for it directly affects the public safety of the immediate area residents, bus, truck, and public safety equipment, especially in times of an emergency and extreme inclement weather. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=100.723s">Be</a>  it further resolved, the new intersection island at the Woburn Street intersection of High Street exposes the City of Medford to potential lawsuits from any such accidents from the installation, and as such, we, the City Council, respectfully put the City Administration on notice for being opposed for making our city exposed for liability. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=117.69s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=118.91s">Mr.</a>  President, this is something that's been out there for a couple of weeks now that I put on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=123.845s">and</a>  disregard to the new traffic configuration at the top of High Street, Woobin, and Hastings. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=132.632s">I</a>  lived on Hastings Lane at the top of the street for 10 years, and I know the safety issues that go up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=139.977s">I</a>  lived in the house there, and when the trucks came by, my house rattled. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=145.021s">And</a>  I don't know if anybody's gone by to see the island there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=148.405s">Not</a>  that I'm opposed to having an island somewhere. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=151.33s">That</a>  is not a location where that island should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=153.954s">First</a>  of all, it's narrow for trucks to traverse at the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=160.38s">Route</a>  60 is a major truck route. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=163.662s">Gasoline</a>  tankers go by there all day and night. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=167.465s">Be</a>  there at 2, 3 in the morning when those trucks go rolling down there in the dark. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=171.588s">They're</a>  not going to see that, and someone's going to hit it because there's no light there on either end. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=175.812s">Someone's</a>  going to hit it, and they're going to tip over, and you're going to see a fuel spill, similar to what we saw on the Merritt-Arlington line some years back. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=184.484s">They</a>  spilled 30,000 gallons of fuel into the Mystic River. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=188.645s">And</a>  I don't want to see that happen again over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=190.706s">So</a>  people are saying that I don't care about public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=193.727s">The</a>  reason I have this here is because I do care about public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=196.948s">And</a>  I care about the public safety of the people that live in that neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=200.409s">That's</a>  my neighborhood where I live. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=203.53s">On</a>  Sunday, the island has been hit. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=206.675s">Sunday</a>  morning at 9 o'clock in the morning, the island got hit by a car. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=209.837s">It</a>  had to be taken out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=211.558s">DPOW</a>  had to clean up the mess. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=213.579s">And</a>  it just started. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=215.9s">It's</a>  only been there for three weeks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=219.442s">The</a>  fire chief had the fire trucks get on there, try to make the turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=223.064s">He</a>  says, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=223.604s">He</a>  says the truck was able to make the turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=225.866s">He</a>  says it was a little thin. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=227.226s">He</a>  said there was only a foot of space on both sides of the road. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=232.569s">What</a>  are we going to do in the wintertime <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=234.58s">when</a>  there's snow on the road there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=236.341s">And</a>  the road goes from 10 feet down to 8 feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=240.264s">And</a>  those trucks, how do they make that turn? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=243.647s">So</a>  if you read the traffic engineer's report, he wants you to go into the opposite lane and make the turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=250.231s">Talk</a>  to the firemen that did the test route. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=254.154s">Why</a>  wasn't the chief consultant on this? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=256.956s">This</a>  is the man that <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=259.234s">He's</a>  one of our chief safety officers in the city. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=262.257s">He</a>  wasn't even consulted on this yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=264.54s">Again,</a>  it's not about the island, but it's the placement of the island. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=271.388s">Listen.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=275.144s">You</a>  want to have an island. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=275.885s">The</a>  island on Woolman Street is fine. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=277.906s">That</a>  island on High Street, it's narrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=280.348s">Go</a>  down to the island by the Brooks School, much wider, and it's not on a turn. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=287.034s">Now,</a>  when the trucks are coming up the hill, they have to accelerate to get up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=291.878s">It's</a>  going to be difficult to picture. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=293.319s">There's</a>  got to be a light, at least, on one side of that in order to break that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=297.203s">If</a>  not, accidents are going to continue to happen. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=300.526s">Listen.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=302.566s">The</a>  government makes mistakes. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=303.526s">We</a>  make mistakes and then we do things wrong. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=305.507s">Let's</a>  figure out what we did wrong here and try to fix it and make it right before the city ends up getting sued and before somebody gets hurt on that piece of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=317.071s">And</a>  it is about public safety. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=319.832s">It's</a>  not anything else. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=321.432s">So</a>  thank you, Mr. President.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=325.454s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Morell.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=328.115s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=328.895s">Is</a>  the traffic engineer on the call? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=331.596s">Do</a>  we know?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=332.983s">I</a>  can't answer that question because the council president's computer shut off.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=336.426s">I</a>  just have questions for them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=337.526s">So</a>  if they're not here, I don't have anything right now.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=360.2s">I</a>  do not see the traffic engineer on the call. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=362.441s">Nope,</a>  sitting in there, the traffic engineer. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=364.802s">Any</a>  other councilors have anything they'd like to say?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=367.903s">Councilor</a>  Bears. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=368.603s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=370.464s">Thank</a>  you, President Caraviello for putting this forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=375.066s">As</a>  it stands, you know, it says as being opposed to the new island installation, I'm not opposed to an island. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=381.048s">If</a>  we could change that to concerns regarding the placement of the new island installation, then I would be more comfortable voting for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=387.251s">All</a>  right, did you get that, Mr. Clerk?</p>

    <p>[Hurtubise]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=400.894s">So</a>  you want to amend it to say concerns regarding placement of the new island?</p>

    <p>[Bears]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=405.216s">Yeah,</a>  so where it says as being opposed to, change that to that we have concerns regarding the placement of. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=415.959s">I</a>  wouldn't mind seeing it redesigned, but if it's essential, it's, you know.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=420.641s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Morocco.</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=425.908s">Thank</a>  you, Mr. President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=426.929s">I'm</a>  curious if we could also request from the city solicitor just if this does, in fact, open us up to liability, if it's up to code, you know, does that open us up to liability? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=436.474s">I</a>  mean, I know people can sue for whatever, but are we, in fact, opened up to liability if this meets the code?</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=442.818s">Do</a>  you offer that as an amendment or as a B paper?</p>

    <p>[Morell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=445.039s">An</a>  amendment, if you'll oblige. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=448.581s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=451.903s">Chair,</a>  wait a second. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=453.764s">Seconded</a>  by Councilor Scarpelli.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=456.162s">Thank</a>  you.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=459.79s">Chair</a>  recognizes Mr. Penter at the podium.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=463.132s">Good</a>  evening, my name is Bob Penta, Zero Summit Road, former member of the Sarkis party. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=467.496s">I</a>  would respectfully disagree with using the word concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=470.279s">The</a>  fact of the matter is that an accident has already taken place. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=472.921s">Tank</a>  has already been going down that road and coming up that road. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=476.184s">You</a>  have MBTA buses telling you, you have a line from your own traffic consultant that tells you that a fire truck, if has to, can go on the opposite lane. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=486.073s">You</a>  have no idea at what time of day or night that that might be happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=489.436s">The</a>  whole idea, I believe, the impetus of the council president's resolution is to let this city administration know that this council is not supportive of this type of islands coming in here. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=503.304s">You</a>  can call it part of the complete streets program, the $563,000 that the city got from the commonwealth. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=509.888s">Where</a>  was the fire chief being consulted on that? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=512.33s">Where</a>  was the city engineer being consulted? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=514.251s">And</a>  all these proposed bump outs that are being planned right now, continuing down on High Street, going into the West Medford area, where's the consultation for that? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=523.599s">Just</a>  go look at Sagamore Avenue and see the way they want to have that cutout coming out into the middle of High Street and then Boston Avenue over there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=531.064s">And</a>  then further down, right opposite the Brooks School, there's a gentleman who just did his driveway over and he's got a bump out in front of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=536.308s">It</a>  doesn't make any sense at all. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=538.49s">I</a>  would not change one word in the president's resolution, only for one reason. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=542.311s">The</a>  city administration has to know that you do recognize that this is a safety problem here in the city of Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=548.192s">This</a>  isn't just for cars. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=549.753s">This</a>  is for trucks. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=550.873s">This</a>  is for ambulances. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=552.273s">This</a>  is for other kinds of vehicles that are heavy duty going down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=556.334s">And</a>  we're not talking about a good day, as the council just alluded to on Sunday at 9 o'clock in the morning. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=561.795s">The</a>  gentleman, unfortunately, didn't see the island. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=564.376s">Not</a>  only didn't see the island, he wrecked the whole bottom of the carriage of his car. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=568.738s">What</a>  are you going to do in a snowstorm when it's dark out late at night and you have a big heavy tanker going down there? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=575.046s">What</a>  are you going to do with a bicycle, a gentleman or a lady driving their bike down there, going in that little lane there, and you have an emergency vehicle trying to get by? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=585.42s">You</a>  know, one thing I learned after many years of being on this council is one thing. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=590.962s">If</a>  you know you see something that's wrong, why would you want to just smooth it over, use the word of concern as relates to telling the city administration, you're going to continue on with this complete streets program, this traffic calming issue, then the public safety is the priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=608.887s">And</a>  right now it's quite obvious that it's not a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=611.547s">Correct</a>  me if I'm wrong, Council President, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=613.828s">Fire</a>  Chief said, even though he can get by, he's only got a foot on either side. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=617.818s">Is</a>  that what he said?</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=620.863s">to</a>  the chair. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=622.184s">The</a>  chief said that it was, he said he had about a foot on either side, and on Sunday at the cemetery, I talked to the people who actually drove the test route, and they said it was a little tight, but they have concerns about making that turn in the winter, when the roadway gets narrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=640.512s">So</a>  that's where the concern is. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=642.413s">And</a>  if you look down where the islands by the Brooks School is, you can see how much wider it is there versus the width <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=651.283s">on</a>  the turn.</p>

    <p>[Penta]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=653.904s">I</a>  would believe that the impetus of the resolution, if you want to get to the concern that Mr. Isaac Beers has introduced, that would be something that they would once again look at to come back, okay, we'll redesign it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=667.652s">But</a>  you'd lose your impact by putting the city on notice that you've recognized, you've talked, this is four times in a month, you have discussed this issue and it's not going away. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=679.152s">And</a>  the only way it's going to go away is if the city administration is aware of it and whoever their contact is with the state for the purposes of trying to make this correction, so be it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=688.674s">As</a>  of this Sunday, the fire chief, as of this Sunday, the fire chief still hasn't been informed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=693.175s">So</a>  he had to go out there and do his dry run. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=695.555s">Well,</a>  how do you call that progress? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=697.916s">How</a>  do you call that when somebody is supposed to sit down and let's talk about this traffic calming issue? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=703.837s">How</a>  can it be traffic calming when you haven't even spoken to the public safety personnel who it's going to affect? <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=710.559s">You</a>  know, it isn't like you guys, young lady, are in a tough bind. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=716.882s">It's</a>  a very simple resolution that the President has offered. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=723.225s">as</a>  the mayor of this community and to your departments, we're putting you on notice because God forbid something happens and somebody gets killed, this council has put the city on notice. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=733.328s">If</a>  not, God forbid something happens and you modify that resolution, you're all gonna be part of a lawsuit. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=740.93s">And</a>  then you're gonna have to explain your way out of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=743.651s">That's</a>  wrong and that shouldn't happen like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=747.454s">I</a>  would suggest, Mr. President, that you do not accept the resolution to modify it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=752.939s">Just</a>  make it as a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=754.02s">It's</a>  not a concern. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=755.001s">It's</a>  an issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=755.842s">It's</a>  a public safety issue that demands its attention one way or the other. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=760.987s">And</a>  if they don't want to resolve it, shame on them. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=763.129s">At</a>  least the council's on record explaining the reason why. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=766.172s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=768.034s">Mr.</a>  President. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=770.837s">Chair</a>  recognizes Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=787.167s">their</a>  potential concerns on this area. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=790.509s">We</a>  also did hear back from the traffic engineer and the city engineer regarding the design standards and safety standards that meet state and federal guidelines. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=801.776s">And</a>  at this point, in my opinion, that intersection of Woburn and High was a free-for-all. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=809.892s">a</a>  complete free-for-all. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=811.834s">This</a>  actually makes a difference, in my opinion. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=815.316s">It</a>  clearly defines going up or taking a right or a left. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=820.3s">It</a>  clearly defines it now, which never existed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=823.663s">Now,</a>  if the issue is whether or not a fire apparatus can get there during snow time and clement weather and so forth, that's an issue that needs to be looked at and addressed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=832.43s">I</a>  don't think anyone doubts what former Councilor Pence is stating. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=836.873s">And</a>  I'm hoping that's taking place. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=839.035s">because</a>  we've addressed this on several occasions. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=841.856s">But</a>  by no stretch, Mr. President, do I believe that this area was better off prior to the work that was done, because I do believe that work clearly delineates where you have to go now and where you have to stay and so forth. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=857.864s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Marks.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=860.506s">Point</a>  of information, Councilor Caraviello.</p>

    <p>[Caraviello]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=861.826s">The</a>  major concern is the width of the roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=865.472s">That's</a>  the real concern, where it really narrows down to a very narrow point there. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=871.475s">That's</a>  really the big concern that I have, that it needs some more space on both sides of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=878.158s">That's</a>  the whole crux of this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=882.92s">Again,</a>  if someone's riding a bike and a car down there, they can't fit together. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=887.382s">It</a>  needs to be widened a little more at some point there.</p>

    <p>[Marks]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=890.185s">Right,</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=891.185s">And</a>  I don't disagree with you, but I'm saying at some point we have to rely on the experts and the professionals. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=898.252s">And</a>  if they're telling us that this complies with all safety standards and so forth, I think we have to at least rely on that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=905.158s">But</a>  I don't know if that's fully been vetted out yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=908.18s">And</a>  just because the state came in and did work there, to me, I think it at least, at the very least, requires an additional look. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=916.123s">And</a>  that's, I think, what we've been asking for the last three or four weeks, for the city to take an additional look. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=921.825s">Asking</a>  to take stuff down now and so forth, I don't have the expertise to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=926.725s">You</a>  know, I don't have the expertise to say take something down. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=929.868s">What</a>  I do have is the common sense to say maybe it should be reviewed. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=933.832s">But</a>  clearly, these type of initiatives, and I've been talking about them for 20 years, so I can't take a back step on it. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=940.8s">Traffic</a>  calming initiatives do work in the community. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=944.138s">And</a>  these are traffic calming issues. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=946.599s">We</a>  may not like this one in particular or think it doesn't fit in this particular area, but these bump outs, these extending of sidewalks, these definitely make a difference when it comes to slowing traffic down. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=958.803s">It's</a>  a known fact. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=960.444s">It's</a>  not only happening in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=961.984s">It's</a>  happening all over the state. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=963.705s">across</a>  the country. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=964.545s">So</a>  I think we have to proceed with caution on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=968.507s">I</a>  support having it looked at. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=970.547s">You're</a>  right, if it is a safety concern, I agree with you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=973.628s">That's</a>  a neighborhood. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=974.408s">And</a>  if we're in fear that trucks may have a hard time navigating over there, absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=980.47s">I</a>  think we're obligated to say that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=982.931s">But</a>  I'm not an engineer or a professional to say that we should start redesigning, because I don't know what a redesign would look like. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=990.076s">That's</a>  not something that I do. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=992.738s">So</a>  I will support the resolution, because I think it makes sense. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=998.982s">But</a>  I'm not prepared to say that we have to take a step back and start redesigning things, because that's not in my realm.</p>

    <p>[Knight]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1007.247s">Thank</a>  you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1008.628s">Couldn't</a>  agree with you more, Councilman Max. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1012.736s">Chair</a>  recognizes Jared Powell. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1014.458s">Clerk,</a>  will the clerk please unmute Jared Powell.</p>

    <p>[Jared Powell]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1022.173s">All</a>  right, thank you. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1023.393s">This</a>  is Jared Powell from 82 Brookings Street in Medford. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1027.334s">I</a>  am the current chair of the Medford Bicycle Advisory Commission. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1032.355s">I'm</a>  attending tonight largely to speak about the high street thing or provide some comments. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1037.197s">I</a>  wanted to first thank Councilor Marks for his comments just now about how, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1043.739s">This</a>  should represent a significant improvement to the state of affairs on High Street. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1049.186s">I</a>  certainly agree with that. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1050.668s">I</a>  myself am not an engineer, though I do believe that this process has been vetted by local and state officials and follows the various guidelines that are appropriate. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1061.563s">I</a>  do think that any project could be better. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1064.345s">I</a>  don't want to make the perfect the enemy of the good, however. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1069.99s">We</a>  should bear in mind the pre-existing conditions of this roadway. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1074.274s">They</a>  are intense, they are unpleasant for people on foot, for people who are biking, and frankly, for people who are driving as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1082.522s">We</a>  try to, in the commission, we try to keep <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1084.904s">of</a>  those interests align and pay attention to the needs of the whole. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1089.47s">But</a>  I do want to keep in mind that at a high level, this represents a significant improvement for the area. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1096.699s">Any</a>  traffic changes, particularly to streets that have been the way they are for a long time, <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1102.446s">are</a>  probably going to require a little bit of learning and new driver reorientation in particular. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1109.293s">That's</a>  certainly going to happen but we do have real problems now on that street with speed and safety and with bad behavior of drivers and frankly a lack of confusion. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1122.325s">You</a>  know it's wide and it does create kind of a free fall <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1126.42s">you</a>  know, a free for all situation, as one of the other councilors mentioned. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1130.162s">So</a>  I do want to thank everyone who's been working on this. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1133.444s">I</a>  appreciate people who have been asking the tough questions and making sure that it does conform to all the standards that we want, but I don't want us to lose track of the fact that this is certainly a substantial improvement over the way things have been for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/-tCCcF67nLU&t=1151.595s">Thank</a>  you.</p>
