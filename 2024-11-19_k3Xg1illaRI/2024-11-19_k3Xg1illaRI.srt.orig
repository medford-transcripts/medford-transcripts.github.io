1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:04,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, everyone.

[SPEAKER_03]: Present.

[SPEAKER_03]: All attendance.

19
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:36,924
[SPEAKER_03]: The purpose of this meeting this evening is to discuss allegations of a legal and personal nature due to something received by the Council.

20
00:00:36,944 --> 00:00:40,446
[SPEAKER_03]: The City Council has chosen to enter an executive session for this discussion.

21
00:00:40,466 --> 00:00:43,627
[SPEAKER_03]: The City Council has also invited City Solicitor Cummings Cameron to attend

22
00:00:56,926 --> 00:00:57,486
[SPEAKER_03]: this meeting.

23
00:00:58,227 --> 00:00:58,887
[SPEAKER_03]: Do I have a motion?

24
00:00:58,927 --> 00:01:03,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion for approval, Mr. President.

25
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:05,470
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

26
00:01:13,535 --> 00:01:13,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

27
00:01:16,936 --> 00:01:18,377
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the mic on, Mr. President?

28
00:01:19,558 --> 00:01:19,718
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

29
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me now?

30
00:01:21,519 --> 00:01:21,659
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

31
00:01:22,823 --> 00:01:23,103
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

32
00:01:23,143 --> 00:01:25,064
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I was saying, there were 10 specific purposes.

33
00:01:25,084 --> 00:01:38,311
[SPEAKER_15]: The first and perhaps the most applicable is to discuss the reputation, character, physical condition, mental health of an individual, or to discuss discipline of dismissal of, or complaints or charges brought against the public officer, employee, staff, or individual.

34
00:01:39,451 --> 00:01:42,153
[SPEAKER_15]: That particular purpose invokes individual rights.

35
00:01:42,753 --> 00:01:45,574
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to be mindful of everyone's individual rights.

36
00:01:46,255 --> 00:01:52,398
[SPEAKER_15]: So the individuals to be discussed in executive session have to be notified by the public body at least 48 hours in advance,

37
00:01:53,012 --> 00:01:54,073
[SPEAKER_15]: They have the right to be present.

38
00:01:54,153 --> 00:01:57,335
[SPEAKER_15]: They have the right to counsel or a representative present.

39
00:01:57,756 --> 00:02:05,021
[SPEAKER_15]: They may also choose to have an open meeting and that choice will take precedence over the public body's option to go into executive session.

40
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:11,086
[SPEAKER_15]: So simply put what the council can discuss during a meeting, it's governed by open meeting laws.

41
00:02:12,086 --> 00:02:13,508
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just wanted to reiterate that.

42
00:02:13,528 --> 00:02:17,971
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we all understand what can be said and can't be said in the executive session.

43
00:02:22,415 --> 00:02:25,716
[SPEAKER_15]: So just to remind the council that there's individual rights.

44
00:02:26,016 --> 00:02:26,396
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

45
00:02:26,596 --> 00:02:26,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

46
00:02:26,876 --> 00:02:27,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

47
00:02:27,516 --> 00:02:28,897
[SPEAKER_03]: On that point, Mr. President.

48
00:02:29,937 --> 00:02:30,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Vice President Knight.

49
00:02:30,697 --> 00:02:40,119
[SPEAKER_05]: So would it be the solicitor's recommendation to go into executive session at this point in time, or would it be your recommendation to follow some sort of notification process?

50
00:02:41,179 --> 00:02:50,722
[SPEAKER_05]: I noticed that, you know, there's nine other reasons why we could go in and maybe she could shed some light on whether or not this would fall into one of those other buckets of,

51
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,090
[SPEAKER_05]: appropriate authority.

52
00:02:56,411 --> 00:03:01,672
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, in my opinion, none of the other reasons would apply here.

53
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:05,173
[SPEAKER_15]: And that particular purpose does trigger individual rights.

54
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:08,994
[SPEAKER_15]: So I want to make sure that the council follows individual rights.

55
00:03:09,034 --> 00:03:09,534
[SPEAKER_15]: I know you will.

56
00:03:10,194 --> 00:03:11,174
[SPEAKER_15]: So I just want to point that out.

57
00:03:11,615 --> 00:03:12,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.

58
00:03:12,615 --> 00:03:12,935
[SPEAKER_15]: You're welcome.

59
00:03:13,055 --> 00:03:14,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion for approval, Mr. President.

60
00:03:14,135 --> 00:03:17,556
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the motion by Councilor Mox, seconded by?

61
00:03:17,756 --> 00:03:18,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President.

62
00:03:18,776 --> 00:03:19,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Baez.

63
00:03:20,177 --> 00:03:21,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Solicitor, thanks for being here.

64
00:03:21,397 --> 00:03:21,937
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

65
00:03:23,823 --> 00:03:34,487
[SPEAKER_08]: if we were to enter executive session per that category, would it automatically invoke individual rights no matter what we discuss or would it depend on what we discuss in the meeting?

66
00:03:36,028 --> 00:03:44,571
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, so entering into executive session, it invokes a 48 hour notice requirement to the individuals to be discussed 48 hours prior to the actual meeting taking place.

67
00:03:44,591 --> 00:03:44,671
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

68
00:03:48,505 --> 00:03:54,270
[SPEAKER_05]: The motion by Councillor Marks, seconded by— So, in essence, then, what we're doing is tonight we're going to vote to go into executive session.

69
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,993
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to wait 48 hours before we do that because of the individual rights?

70
00:03:58,614 --> 00:03:58,914
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

71
00:04:01,837 --> 00:04:04,259
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not discussing any names, right?

72
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:10,264
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having this meeting to sit down and talk to our city solicitor, right?

73
00:04:10,324 --> 00:04:15,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that— I will warn all Councillors that no individuals will be named.

74
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:29,834
[SPEAKER_03]: or positions or any departments or anything like that, I suggest that we listen to the city's solicitor first before any questions are asked.

75
00:04:30,114 --> 00:04:31,034
[SPEAKER_03]: And take her advice.

76
00:04:32,435 --> 00:04:39,076
[SPEAKER_13]: But it's my understanding that because of the reason we would be using to go into this executive session, it's triggering that.

77
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:40,457
[SPEAKER_13]: So by using that reason,

78
00:04:41,465 --> 00:04:43,246
[SPEAKER_13]: it already triggers that 40 hour notice.

79
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:43,926
[SPEAKER_15]: So our options.

80
00:04:43,986 --> 00:04:44,206
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.

81
00:04:44,286 --> 00:04:51,230
[SPEAKER_15]: So you wouldn't be able to enter into an executive session under this purpose without the notification to the individual rights that are about to be discussed.

82
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:57,873
[SPEAKER_15]: If that hasn't occurred, then you wouldn't be able to use that purpose to go into an executive session.

83
00:04:57,893 --> 00:04:59,173
[SPEAKER_15]: We could have a regular meeting.

84
00:05:01,866 --> 00:05:04,747
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand why the city council can never meet an executive session.

85
00:05:05,327 --> 00:05:07,908
[SPEAKER_02]: But the school committee every other week can, Mr. President.

86
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:09,408
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes zero sense to me.

87
00:05:09,748 --> 00:05:24,292
[SPEAKER_02]: And why we can't discuss an executive session without returning an issue, Mr. President, which makes zero sense to me, too, and maybe cries out for the fact that this council needs to have a line item in the budget to have representation, Mr. President.

88
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:29,073
[SPEAKER_02]: for exact issues like we're experiencing right now, Mr. President.

89
00:05:29,213 --> 00:05:36,015
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, as I've said, nothing, no names will be mentioned or any that we listen to.

90
00:05:36,275 --> 00:05:37,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, I move the question.

91
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:37,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

92
00:05:37,815 --> 00:05:38,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I move the question.

93
00:05:38,535 --> 00:05:39,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Go on.

94
00:05:40,436 --> 00:05:40,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

95
00:05:40,936 --> 00:05:43,636
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by?

96
00:05:45,337 --> 00:05:45,637
[SPEAKER_12]: Second.

97
00:05:46,557 --> 00:05:47,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by Councilor Scott Kelly.

98
00:05:48,338 --> 00:05:49,018
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

99
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:49,838
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

100
00:05:49,998 --> 00:05:50,798
[SPEAKER_12]: Roll call, please.

101
00:05:51,478 --> 00:05:52,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

102
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:53,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

103
00:05:57,713 --> 00:06:17,852
[SPEAKER_14]: to executive session for the reason that was stated earlier, we would have to give the people that are going to be discussed, individuals 48 hours notice, which means that the earliest we could go into executive session is Friday, Thursday, Friday.

104
00:06:25,038 --> 00:06:26,479
[SPEAKER_15]: I know it's wildly unpopular.

105
00:06:26,539 --> 00:06:30,624
[SPEAKER_15]: I just want to make sure that this council is following individual rights in the open meeting.

106
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:32,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes we have to make unpopular decisions.

107
00:06:33,407 --> 00:06:33,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Indeed.

108
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:36,891
[SPEAKER_03]: Please call the roll.

109
00:06:39,047 --> 00:06:46,053
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if the recommendations that we go into executive session, but that executive session happens, I'm just, I want to be in compliance with the law.

110
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:57,502
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't want to turn this into an issue where there's an open meeting law complaint filed against the council when the nature and substance of the materials that the council received was so significant and important.

111
00:06:58,263 --> 00:07:02,927
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I don't want the, the underlying issue as to why we're trying to meet to be

112
00:07:06,162 --> 00:07:12,688
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, taken away from, to be distracted by an open meeting law complaint that may or may not be sufficient.

113
00:07:12,748 --> 00:07:21,175
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we've had our fair share of frivolous complaints in the past, but, you know, where it involves employee rights, I think we need to earn the side of caution.

114
00:07:21,235 --> 00:07:22,477
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's the case, that's the case.

115
00:07:23,578 --> 00:07:26,280
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, based on the fact that we did receive materials,

116
00:07:28,237 --> 00:07:40,526
[SPEAKER_05]: that were before us, can the solicitor maybe provide us with a little bit of guidance as to how we can discuss this information while still protecting the individual rights of the subjects of the complaint?

117
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:44,930
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, is there a way we can even talk about it without invoking individual rights?

118
00:07:46,331 --> 00:07:49,113
[SPEAKER_15]: My suggestion would be to follow open meeting law guidelines.

119
00:07:49,533 --> 00:07:57,159
[SPEAKER_15]: If you want to discuss this in an executive session, or even if you don't and you want to discuss this in an open session, you need to give notification to the individuals that are going to be discussed.

120
00:07:57,883 --> 00:08:03,347
[SPEAKER_15]: They have the right to console or representative present, they have the right to have 48 hours advance notice of the meeting.

121
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,129
[SPEAKER_15]: This is all in accordance with the open meeting law.

122
00:08:06,890 --> 00:08:10,452
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if the council elected to go into executive session for this purpose.

123
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:15,917
[SPEAKER_07]: How would the notification process take place would you be responsible for doing the notification with the city clerk be responsible

124
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:27,369
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I ask a question?

125
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:35,752
[SPEAKER_10]: So there is an agenda posted for a special council meeting on Saturday morning at 8.30.

126
00:08:36,032 --> 00:08:39,333
[SPEAKER_10]: I have posted it in compliance with the open meeting law already.

127
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:54,398
[SPEAKER_10]: If I am to, would an email, would an attachment of that email to any parties impacted serve as notice or would it have to be a separate agenda, a new agenda?

128
00:08:55,217 --> 00:09:06,624
[SPEAKER_10]: If I sent that, if I sent that email to the parties who were, uh, who, who may be discussed, uh, and said that you are invited, I'm providing this as formal notice with that sufficient or what I think it would be fine.

129
00:09:06,644 --> 00:09:11,367
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll look into it more, but I'm glad you mentioned that because I'm not going to be here on Saturday morning.

130
00:09:15,749 --> 00:09:23,674
[SPEAKER_12]: Mr. President, you know, I don't know how everybody else feels, but I think that with what we're hearing,

131
00:09:24,434 --> 00:09:29,020
[SPEAKER_12]: and what we received and aligned with budget concerns.

132
00:09:32,124 --> 00:09:40,635
[SPEAKER_12]: One glaring is what Council Marcus brought up, that do we continue with the budget considering what jumps to the top of my list now

133
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:44,769
[SPEAKER_12]: is legal representation for the council, nothing against the city solicitor.

134
00:09:45,429 --> 00:09:53,952
[SPEAKER_12]: I honor and respect her opinion, but the truth of the matter is she still works for, she doesn't work for this department.

135
00:09:53,972 --> 00:09:55,673
[SPEAKER_12]: She doesn't work for the council.

136
00:09:56,673 --> 00:10:09,518
[SPEAKER_12]: So, cause I'm, you know, I trust what she's saying, but I also I'm questioning the validity of the other reasons to me.

137
00:10:11,432 --> 00:10:26,844
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, personnel legal, you know, it just, it just, I, we're in a timeline with the budget, but I don't know if I'm, I, you know, I, I gotta think about whether I want to move forward with this budget.

138
00:10:28,865 --> 00:10:29,946
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's what I'm saying.

139
00:10:29,986 --> 00:10:35,410
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we can't meet Saturday with the city solicitor, with all this information,

140
00:10:36,756 --> 00:10:40,199
[SPEAKER_12]: and without violating any open meeting laws.

141
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:50,206
[SPEAKER_12]: And this pushes the city business to a point where... Tuesday is the last regular meeting of the council.

142
00:10:50,907 --> 00:10:53,669
[SPEAKER_03]: And the budget must be passed or denied by then.

143
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:03,436
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mr. President, if I could, then I was under the impression like when we had our emergency meeting on Saturday,

144
00:11:04,035 --> 00:11:08,136
[SPEAKER_02]: That meeting was for the sole purpose of discussing scheduling.

145
00:11:09,337 --> 00:11:10,157
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a meeting.

146
00:11:10,197 --> 00:11:13,278
[SPEAKER_02]: We discussed potential scheduling, which led to tonight.

147
00:11:13,638 --> 00:11:14,058
[SPEAKER_02]: That's correct.

148
00:11:14,238 --> 00:11:20,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I was on the impression tonight we were going to get some guidance from the city solicitor about potential next steps.

149
00:11:21,936 --> 00:11:25,478
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's all we were going to discuss, potential next steps.

150
00:11:25,998 --> 00:11:37,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, knowing what we hear tonight, Mr. President, I don't feel comfortable being in a room with other parties, Mr. President, without having representation, legal representation on behalf of the council.

151
00:11:38,346 --> 00:11:43,389
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would ask that whatever meaning we do have, that we invite legal counsel

152
00:11:44,622 --> 00:11:54,274
[SPEAKER_02]: outside legal counsel to the meeting to represent the method City Council, Mr President, because I'm sure other parties and entities probably have their own legal counsel.

153
00:11:54,915 --> 00:12:00,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and that is, uh, so I was hoping tonight we would get that, uh, you know,

154
00:12:01,303 --> 00:12:06,405
[SPEAKER_02]: go ahead from the city solicitor to go ahead to whatever we feel comfortable with.

155
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:22,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Without discussing allegations, without discussing names, without violating anyone's rights, Mr. President, because this council is not in the business of violating rights, but we are in the business, Mr. President, where we're presented with allegations to make sure we take them seriously.

156
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:26,151
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's what we're trying to do as a council.

157
00:12:26,251 --> 00:12:28,892
[SPEAKER_02]: But if my hands are tied that we can't meet,

158
00:12:30,102 --> 00:12:35,743
[SPEAKER_02]: without I don't understand why a body, a legislative body that's elected by the people can't meet.

159
00:12:36,264 --> 00:12:38,004
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand the open meeting law.

160
00:12:38,064 --> 00:12:44,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe me, can't meet to discuss with our attorney, Mr President, next steps that the council will take.

161
00:12:45,286 --> 00:12:46,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand that.

162
00:12:46,806 --> 00:12:49,167
[SPEAKER_02]: And I still can't fathom why we can't do that.

163
00:12:49,247 --> 00:12:54,648
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, vice president, I don't think that this is that is saying we can't meet.

164
00:12:55,197 --> 00:13:02,179
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what the solicitor is saying is that we can need, we just have to wait 48 hours to notify the- So respectfully, when did we ask for this meeting?

165
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:04,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Saturday.

166
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:06,420
[SPEAKER_02]: No, when did we ask?

167
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,820
[SPEAKER_02]: We asked Saturday for this meeting.

168
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,600
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I correct, Mr. Clerk?

169
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:10,841
[SPEAKER_02]: When did we ask?

170
00:13:10,921 --> 00:13:13,361
[SPEAKER_03]: It was scheduled for Tuesday and then rescheduled for today.

171
00:13:13,381 --> 00:13:13,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

172
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:13,921
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

173
00:13:13,981 --> 00:13:21,443
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the same solicitor said- So it's been, with all due respect, two to three days, and now we're hearing that we really shouldn't be meeting.

174
00:13:23,503 --> 00:13:25,064
[SPEAKER_12]: Right, am I missing something?

175
00:13:25,084 --> 00:13:26,425
[SPEAKER_12]: A point of information, if I can.

176
00:13:26,585 --> 00:13:27,466
[SPEAKER_12]: What is the posting?

177
00:13:27,546 --> 00:13:29,628
[SPEAKER_12]: What was the posting that was sent out?

178
00:13:30,709 --> 00:13:32,470
[SPEAKER_12]: For this meeting?

179
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,091
[SPEAKER_12]: What did we send out?

180
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:36,053
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you read that back?

181
00:13:36,173 --> 00:13:37,794
[SPEAKER_12]: The reason for the purpose of the meeting?

182
00:13:39,335 --> 00:13:51,805
[SPEAKER_03]: The purpose of the meeting, the rescheduled, the purpose of the meeting is to discuss allegations of a legal and personnel nature received by the city council.

183
00:13:55,805 --> 00:13:59,787
[SPEAKER_05]: So what would the notification requirements be if we were to notify?

184
00:13:59,807 --> 00:14:01,488
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that be certified mail, certified letter?

185
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:03,450
[SPEAKER_05]: Does it have to be hand-delivered?

186
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,711
[SPEAKER_05]: What would the process service requirement be?

187
00:14:05,731 --> 00:14:11,775
[SPEAKER_15]: I think in the past, emails or direct mail correspondence has sufficed.

188
00:14:11,835 --> 00:14:12,255
[SPEAKER_12]: So if I can.

189
00:14:18,218 --> 00:14:35,203
[SPEAKER_12]: If we were to retire an executive session to discuss the process of concerns of legal personnel matters without the topic, but just the guidance of what the process is.

190
00:14:37,224 --> 00:14:38,364
[SPEAKER_15]: But that's what I'm giving you.

191
00:14:38,484 --> 00:14:42,705
[SPEAKER_15]: See, the problem is you cannot enter executive session without a specific purpose.

192
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:44,586
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

193
00:14:46,322 --> 00:14:48,063
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not, you know, obviously I'm not an attorney.

194
00:14:49,123 --> 00:14:50,284
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just, I'm not done yet.

195
00:14:50,304 --> 00:15:05,450
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just trying to figure out again, if it's not about, if it's just about getting guidance of the legalities of how to proceed, not to discuss what the process is, what the situation is.

196
00:15:07,417 --> 00:15:08,477
[SPEAKER_12]: Am I not making sense?

197
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:11,218
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just trying to figure out why we can't move forward with this.

198
00:15:11,238 --> 00:15:15,840
[SPEAKER_15]: I think what you're asking is whether or not you have the ability to hire outside counsel.

199
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:18,641
[SPEAKER_12]: That would have been one of my questions tonight.

200
00:15:18,661 --> 00:15:23,643
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we have the ability because we've done it in the past.

201
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,124
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hoping to get guidance as the first step tonight.

202
00:15:30,525 --> 00:15:35,766
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand why it would be an OML violation to go into executive session as you're explaining it.

203
00:15:36,246 --> 00:15:44,507
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm just frustrated that we're finding this out right now, as opposed to finding this out like Saturday, you know, when we had the time to invite the people.

204
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:51,649
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's just where my frustration lies right now, where we could have invited the parties to attend and had this meeting.

205
00:15:51,769 --> 00:15:54,449
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's, so that's just where, and I absolutely understand what you're saying.

206
00:15:54,469 --> 00:15:59,670
[SPEAKER_13]: I thank you for explaining it, but I'm just kind of frustrated that we're finding it out now, as opposed to earlier when we could have planned.

207
00:16:00,663 --> 00:16:06,847
[SPEAKER_13]: I understand, I do.

208
00:16:06,987 --> 00:16:10,209
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Councilor Falco's first, I'm sorry.

209
00:16:10,249 --> 00:16:10,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Vice President Knight.

210
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:19,275
[SPEAKER_05]: So ultimately the purpose of us to go into this executive session will be to discuss the complaint that we received and the individuals mentioned into it, right?

211
00:16:19,695 --> 00:16:20,676
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the purpose of the meeting.

212
00:16:21,156 --> 00:16:24,959
[SPEAKER_05]: In order for us to do that, because individuals are mentioned into it, individual rights would kick in.

213
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:27,480
[SPEAKER_05]: So because of that, we have to give 48 hours notice.

214
00:16:28,997 --> 00:16:34,018
[SPEAKER_05]: for us to meet, and we have to notify those individuals that they're going to be discussed and give them the right to attend the meeting?

215
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:34,779
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

216
00:16:35,099 --> 00:16:36,719
[SPEAKER_05]: Do we have to give them the right to participate in the meeting?

217
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:41,040
[SPEAKER_15]: They have the right to hold it in an open session if they so choose.

218
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Hold it in an open session if they so choose.

219
00:16:42,841 --> 00:16:43,101
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

220
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:48,622
[SPEAKER_05]: So, going forward, right, I think we're all, we all want to do something.

221
00:16:48,902 --> 00:16:49,943
[SPEAKER_05]: We all want to have the meeting, right?

222
00:16:50,483 --> 00:16:54,324
[SPEAKER_05]: We have the city solicitor here saying that there's a process that we need to follow, so why don't we just

223
00:16:55,308 --> 00:16:57,290
[SPEAKER_05]: follow the process and get to it.

224
00:16:58,051 --> 00:16:59,412
[SPEAKER_05]: So the earliest we could meet will be Friday.

225
00:17:00,173 --> 00:17:00,854
[SPEAKER_05]: That sound correct?

226
00:17:02,175 --> 00:17:03,477
[SPEAKER_15]: At 520, yeah.

227
00:17:03,777 --> 00:17:04,618
[SPEAKER_02]: 48 hours.

228
00:17:04,638 --> 00:17:05,379
[SPEAKER_02]: 520 Friday.

229
00:17:07,921 --> 00:17:11,045
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do we do that and have legal counsel representing us?

230
00:17:11,954 --> 00:17:17,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think the first thing we do would be we have the meeting to discuss the complaint and the individuals mentioned in it.

231
00:17:17,615 --> 00:17:23,676
[SPEAKER_05]: The city solicitor will be there to provide us with what our obligations are now that we are informed of that.

232
00:17:23,696 --> 00:17:31,038
[SPEAKER_05]: And if that means seek legal counsel on the outside, then that's what we'd be taking up the vote on that day, whether or not that's the direction we want to go in.

233
00:17:31,298 --> 00:17:33,739
[SPEAKER_02]: But there may be other legal counsel there as well.

234
00:17:33,979 --> 00:17:38,260
[SPEAKER_02]: So we won't have any representation, and other parties may have legal counsel.

235
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,320
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't feel comfortable being in a room

236
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,241
[SPEAKER_02]: without having our own legal counsel.

237
00:17:43,701 --> 00:17:44,521
[SPEAKER_05]: So then that might be right.

238
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:47,983
[SPEAKER_05]: That might be the vote that we have to take that on that Saturday on that at that meeting.

239
00:17:49,423 --> 00:17:49,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

240
00:17:49,863 --> 00:17:51,304
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?

241
00:17:51,324 --> 00:17:51,684
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?

242
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:53,545
[SPEAKER_05]: What are our obligations now that we have this?

243
00:17:54,025 --> 00:17:58,547
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why we have to have outside parties in a vote for us to have legal counsel.

244
00:17:59,167 --> 00:18:00,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do we have to have outside parties?

245
00:18:00,907 --> 00:18:01,088
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

246
00:18:01,508 --> 00:18:01,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

247
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't this be done?

248
00:18:03,108 --> 00:18:05,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr President, can we do it just on the floor today?

249
00:18:06,109 --> 00:18:07,590
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to do it on the floor on

250
00:18:08,617 --> 00:18:10,898
[SPEAKER_02]: or maybe you can ask the city solicitor.

251
00:18:11,238 --> 00:18:15,579
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something that we can do just on the floor today requesting outside legal counsel?

252
00:18:16,119 --> 00:18:17,879
[SPEAKER_15]: You would need an appropriation to do so.

253
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:19,839
[SPEAKER_15]: But yes, well, we don't.

254
00:18:19,879 --> 00:18:23,240
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't make appropriations, so that would be up to the city administration.

255
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,681
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, maybe that's the direction.

256
00:18:27,941 --> 00:18:31,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't feel comfortable being here with parties that would not

257
00:18:32,896 --> 00:18:38,699
[SPEAKER_02]: at liberty to discuss anything right now, and having them have legal counsel and us not having any legal counsel.

258
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:43,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's going to get to be a very legal process, I assume.

259
00:18:44,102 --> 00:18:47,703
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think that's what we're looking for ultimately, legal guidance.

260
00:18:47,763 --> 00:18:50,405
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was hoping tonight we were going to get, right?

261
00:18:50,445 --> 00:18:52,065
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was hoping tonight was going to happen.

262
00:18:52,085 --> 00:18:52,686
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we did.

263
00:18:52,706 --> 00:18:54,687
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm looking at it as we did get the legal guidance.

264
00:18:54,707 --> 00:18:59,489
[SPEAKER_05]: The legal guidance we got was don't go into executive session because you didn't notify the people because individual rights kicks in.

265
00:18:59,549 --> 00:19:01,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but that doesn't help us with an attorney.

266
00:19:02,002 --> 00:19:05,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, that helps us not violate the open meeting law, but.

267
00:19:05,484 --> 00:19:10,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, and guides us with the process to get the meeting so that we can move to that goal of getting the attorney.

268
00:19:11,267 --> 00:19:12,907
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and we have to go through the process, right?

269
00:19:13,688 --> 00:19:16,769
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, well, I thought we were going through that process.

270
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:19,791
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President.

271
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:22,432
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. President.

272
00:19:22,472 --> 00:19:23,753
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Belco.

273
00:19:23,773 --> 00:19:24,053
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

274
00:19:24,973 --> 00:19:30,396
[SPEAKER_14]: So could we, if we wanted to make a motion to hire outside legal help tonight?

275
00:19:32,225 --> 00:19:35,546
[SPEAKER_15]: You can make an emotion to request an appropriation for the mayor to do so.

276
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:41,229
[SPEAKER_14]: And then it would be up to the mayor to secure the appropriation to actually go out and hire.

277
00:19:42,009 --> 00:19:42,309
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

278
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:44,330
[SPEAKER_15]: Look, what I can tell you is this.

279
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:47,151
[SPEAKER_14]: So we would, if I may, and I apologize for interrupting.

280
00:19:47,671 --> 00:19:51,193
[SPEAKER_14]: So we would at least be making some progress towards getting to that point.

281
00:19:51,233 --> 00:19:56,155
[SPEAKER_14]: We would have outside legal help to help us down this road.

282
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:58,576
[SPEAKER_14]: If we did that, at least did that piece tonight.

283
00:19:59,847 --> 00:20:10,714
[SPEAKER_14]: waiting for the appropriation that comes from across the hall, I guess, but I'm not sure how long that would take, but it sounds like we could at least go in that direction if the council wanted to, if I'm understanding that correctly.

284
00:20:11,354 --> 00:20:20,060
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, so here's what I can tell you, and I know my opinion is wildly unpopular, but I cannot comment on ongoing personnel matters.

285
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:24,943
[SPEAKER_15]: What I can tell you is that this is being handled and will be.

286
00:20:26,188 --> 00:20:31,249
[SPEAKER_15]: going to an outside third party investigator, separate and apart from myself, because I understand what everybody's saying.

287
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:32,570
[SPEAKER_15]: I am part of the administration.

288
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:33,250
[SPEAKER_15]: I get it.

289
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:42,272
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand your trepidations, which is exactly why I have been recommended and will continue to recommend that this matter went to an outside third party investigator.

290
00:20:44,732 --> 00:20:52,634
[SPEAKER_03]: So you said that the letter that we received over the weekend is being handled by an outside investigator, is that?

291
00:20:52,894 --> 00:20:53,414
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct.

292
00:20:53,434 --> 00:20:55,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what you're saying?

293
00:20:55,395 --> 00:20:55,735
[SPEAKER_14]: If I may.

294
00:20:56,715 --> 00:20:59,417
[SPEAKER_14]: Could you tell us how that process began or how that started.

295
00:20:59,857 --> 00:21:05,461
[SPEAKER_15]: Sure, few weeks back, upon receiving a first email request by the Maya.

296
00:21:05,981 --> 00:21:08,463
[SPEAKER_15]: She had asked me to look into

297
00:21:12,412 --> 00:21:15,734
[SPEAKER_15]: just look into third party outside investigators to start with.

298
00:21:16,094 --> 00:21:17,876
[SPEAKER_15]: I started to gather the information.

299
00:21:18,596 --> 00:21:19,717
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, my mouth is really dry.

300
00:21:19,737 --> 00:21:26,481
[SPEAKER_15]: I started to gather the additional information and then narrowed down my options, making sure that it was fair and impartial.

301
00:21:27,362 --> 00:21:36,868
[SPEAKER_15]: Someone that nobody knew of, somebody that nobody ever heard of, someone that was separate and apart from the city, obviously, and made a recommendation.

302
00:21:37,504 --> 00:21:38,865
[SPEAKER_15]: listed down to two candidates.

303
00:21:39,685 --> 00:21:50,451
[SPEAKER_15]: And earlier today, the mayor had agreed to the first candidate, which was Attorney Green, I believe from an outside law firm.

304
00:21:51,432 --> 00:21:53,093
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's the name?

305
00:21:53,113 --> 00:21:53,773
[SPEAKER_15]: Attorney Green.

306
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:04,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, are you able to outline for what purpose this private investigators being hired?

307
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,561
[SPEAKER_15]: All of the purposes that

308
00:22:07,724 --> 00:22:08,404
[SPEAKER_02]: are you able to?

309
00:22:08,965 --> 00:22:10,786
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you able to outline that now before us?

310
00:22:11,446 --> 00:22:12,407
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, I can't.

311
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:14,488
[SPEAKER_15]: This is out of my hands now, right?

312
00:22:14,748 --> 00:22:16,970
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't know what's being investigated.

313
00:22:17,350 --> 00:22:19,151
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know to what extent, Mr President.

314
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:23,754
[SPEAKER_02]: Eso I think that's why, you know, we have to do our due diligence as well.

315
00:22:24,494 --> 00:22:30,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, and there could be, uh, on multiple ongoing investigations, Mr President.

316
00:22:30,798 --> 00:22:34,300
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't feel comfortable with that response, to be quite honest with you.

317
00:22:35,075 --> 00:22:37,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I'm not sure what the response involves.

318
00:22:38,617 --> 00:22:42,358
[SPEAKER_02]: And were the parties notified about this meeting that was held?

319
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:46,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they have the same rights to show up at City Hall?

320
00:22:47,221 --> 00:22:49,242
[SPEAKER_02]: The two department heads, were they notified?

321
00:22:49,262 --> 00:22:49,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Were they privy to this?

322
00:22:49,862 --> 00:22:50,582
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me, Councilman Marks.

323
00:22:51,042 --> 00:22:51,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Viglione.

324
00:22:52,423 --> 00:22:53,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Other side, please.

325
00:22:53,804 --> 00:22:54,344
[SPEAKER_03]: With your camera.

326
00:22:54,984 --> 00:22:55,565
[SPEAKER_03]: You know the rules.

327
00:22:56,385 --> 00:22:57,806
[SPEAKER_03]: On the other side of the window, please.

328
00:22:57,986 --> 00:22:59,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they fall under the same requirements?

329
00:23:00,207 --> 00:23:00,727
[SPEAKER_15]: What parties?

330
00:23:01,827 --> 00:23:02,868
[SPEAKER_02]: The parties that are involved.

331
00:23:03,865 --> 00:23:13,293
[SPEAKER_02]: were they notified of, I'm sorry, of whatever meeting took place with the city administration regarding the hiring of an investigator with the, uh, it wasn't a meeting though.

332
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:17,656
[SPEAKER_15]: It was upon my recommendation, but it had to take place in a meeting, right?

333
00:23:17,756 --> 00:23:19,117
[SPEAKER_02]: It didn't just happen in the hallway, right?

334
00:23:19,698 --> 00:23:23,000
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a meeting called meeting and more of a request.

335
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:25,102
[SPEAKER_15]: We never met on the topic per se.

336
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:26,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

337
00:23:26,683 --> 00:23:32,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Mr. President, at this point, I think we should proceed as we were going to proceed.

338
00:23:33,217 --> 00:23:33,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President.

339
00:23:33,737 --> 00:23:34,878
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be my recommendation.

340
00:23:35,618 --> 00:23:36,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Biez.

341
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:48,045
[SPEAKER_08]: If we were to enter an executive session that was duly noticed, and we were to ask you what our next steps would be, would your answer likely be that you can't comment on ongoing personnel matters?

342
00:23:48,825 --> 00:23:49,005
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

343
00:23:49,926 --> 00:23:50,226
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

344
00:23:56,089 --> 00:24:01,792
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mr. President, if I could, considering our next discussion is regarding the budget,

345
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:15,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have to notify anyone regarding a request, a formal request by the council for legal council appropriation?

346
00:24:15,741 --> 00:24:21,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Or can we just, as part of the budget discussion, include that into the budget discussion?

347
00:24:21,322 --> 00:24:26,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when we offer motions on the budget, they're not posted in advance, naturally.

348
00:24:27,143 --> 00:24:32,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this evening at six o'clock, the first thing on the agenda will be the law budget.

349
00:24:33,876 --> 00:24:36,739
[SPEAKER_03]: the law department, because that was scheduled for this evening.

350
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, that may be.

351
00:24:40,282 --> 00:24:46,267
[SPEAKER_03]: You can offer that appropriation as a line item, I would assume, going forward.

352
00:24:47,328 --> 00:24:47,968
[SPEAKER_03]: What information?

353
00:24:48,729 --> 00:24:56,135
[SPEAKER_12]: Legislative budget, or it wouldn't fall under the legal budget, correct?

354
00:24:57,416 --> 00:24:59,698
[SPEAKER_12]: So it wouldn't matter what we're doing next.

355
00:25:00,418 --> 00:25:01,580
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a legislative budget.

356
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:07,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless we create a legal line item for a council legal representation, which we can.

357
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,932
[SPEAKER_02]: And one doesn't currently exist.

358
00:25:09,453 --> 00:25:13,800
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we were told is something that we can do as a council.

359
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:14,561
[SPEAKER_02]: We have that authority.

360
00:25:28,048 --> 00:25:34,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm always guidance from the floor with you want to continue on top of a spurs and a question for the system.

361
00:25:34,311 --> 00:25:39,893
[SPEAKER_05]: We seem to be an uncharted waters here yet certain one aspect of the complaints would surround personnel issue.

362
00:25:40,853 --> 00:25:44,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Another aspect of the complaint surrounds financial issue.

363
00:25:44,234 --> 00:25:44,274
[SPEAKER_05]: So

364
00:25:52,301 --> 00:25:56,443
[SPEAKER_05]: The financial issue, I think, is something that certainly warrants investigation.

365
00:25:57,324 --> 00:26:13,133
[SPEAKER_05]: And my request would be, through you, what steps do we have or rights do we have as a council to further investigate that matter where it's not a personnel issue?

366
00:26:14,554 --> 00:26:15,955
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an administration, a government issue.

367
00:26:19,942 --> 00:26:27,147
[SPEAKER_15]: Aside from requesting an appropriation to hire outside a third party, that's the only option I see.

368
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:31,330
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the only thing I can think of.

369
00:26:32,371 --> 00:26:44,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we add it to our council budget and the legislation when we do this department on Saturday, if there's no appropriation from the mayor?

370
00:26:48,745 --> 00:26:50,266
[SPEAKER_15]: There's DLS guidance on this.

371
00:26:50,306 --> 00:26:51,227
[SPEAKER_15]: Let me check it first.

372
00:26:51,427 --> 00:26:55,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I said, we haven't done this department's budget yet.

373
00:26:55,270 --> 00:26:58,453
[SPEAKER_03]: And we could add that on Saturday as a line item.

374
00:26:58,473 --> 00:27:00,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

375
00:27:01,015 --> 00:27:01,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

376
00:27:01,475 --> 00:27:01,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

377
00:27:01,635 --> 00:27:02,276
[SPEAKER_03]: All departments.

378
00:27:02,296 --> 00:27:04,798
[SPEAKER_03]: But I said, we haven't done the legislative branch yet.

379
00:27:05,438 --> 00:27:06,379
[SPEAKER_03]: That'll be on Saturday.

380
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:13,685
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll assume that we can add that item to our budget and as an appropriation.

381
00:27:16,227 --> 00:27:16,307
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

382
00:27:18,718 --> 00:27:29,121
[SPEAKER_05]: When an allegation is raised of financial impropriety, and it's brought to the attention of the council, what obligations legally does the council have in terms of action?

383
00:27:32,322 --> 00:27:37,803
[SPEAKER_15]: Again, outside of hiring a third party investigator, which would logically be the next step, right?

384
00:27:37,863 --> 00:27:39,343
[SPEAKER_15]: Because right now you have complaints.

385
00:27:39,703 --> 00:27:40,964
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, we can't not act, right?

386
00:27:41,164 --> 00:27:43,584
[SPEAKER_05]: So something's been brought to our attention.

387
00:27:43,624 --> 00:27:44,465
[SPEAKER_05]: It's well documented.

388
00:27:46,153 --> 00:27:54,019
[SPEAKER_05]: balls are not going to do something right where they're going to be complicit and the information received and do nothing with it or we're going to look at it right.

389
00:27:54,779 --> 00:28:02,505
[SPEAKER_05]: So how do we do that how do we look at what how do we go about doing that as for this appropriation we're still not going to be able to be in a private session right.

390
00:28:02,545 --> 00:28:08,270
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean it still has to go through the an executive session still needs to go through that individual rights process.

391
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:08,650
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

392
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,860
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

393
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:16,061
[SPEAKER_14]: If we wanted to, could we just refer to a government agency?

394
00:28:18,581 --> 00:28:19,201
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course you could.

395
00:28:20,082 --> 00:28:20,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Like right here, right now?

396
00:28:22,162 --> 00:28:27,563
[SPEAKER_15]: You could, but again, what agency and what are they investigating?

397
00:28:27,643 --> 00:28:29,783
[SPEAKER_15]: Because there has not been an investigation yet.

398
00:28:31,243 --> 00:28:33,384
[SPEAKER_14]: But couldn't they conduct their own investigation?

399
00:28:34,604 --> 00:28:35,324
[SPEAKER_15]: I suppose they could.

400
00:28:35,344 --> 00:28:39,865
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I think that's what, if I'm correct, government agencies have divisions that are usually there for that.

401
00:28:40,646 --> 00:28:41,947
[SPEAKER_14]: That's their purpose.

402
00:28:43,628 --> 00:28:51,471
[SPEAKER_14]: So when I look at this here, we all have the information that was given to us, that was emailed to us.

403
00:28:52,912 --> 00:29:04,018
[SPEAKER_14]: And so, I mean, I look at there, I think a number of options have an independent investigation, which sounds like something like that is already about to begin.

404
00:29:04,038 --> 00:29:08,160
[SPEAKER_14]: That wasn't originated here by the council.

405
00:29:09,243 --> 00:29:11,465
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard there's a lot of talk of doing that, it sounds like.

406
00:29:11,945 --> 00:29:17,249
[SPEAKER_14]: But the other option is just moving this right out to a government agency.

407
00:29:21,412 --> 00:29:22,973
[SPEAKER_14]: To me, that seems like it's an option.

408
00:29:22,993 --> 00:29:35,803
[SPEAKER_14]: And if I may just finish really quick, because when I look at this here, I feel like we have data, we have information, and I feel in some ways we're complicit by not acting on the data that we received.

409
00:29:38,064 --> 00:29:38,965
[SPEAKER_14]: And I do feel that

410
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:49,257
[SPEAKER_14]: and there is some aggravation that we should have been, not prepared, but there should have been a meeting tonight to discuss all of this.

411
00:29:49,818 --> 00:30:03,610
[SPEAKER_14]: And I understand the open meeting law and whatnot, but I also feel like I do have concerns, ongoing concerns, and I'm trying to be careful how I say this so I don't violate anything with what's going on in the four walls here.

412
00:30:04,591 --> 00:30:05,472
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's why I'm thinking,

413
00:30:06,546 --> 00:30:11,687
[SPEAKER_14]: If that's an option to outsource this to a government agency and that's what they do, we should think of that.

414
00:30:12,967 --> 00:30:19,928
[SPEAKER_05]: But on that point, Mr. President, I think it's, you know, the complainant's right if they want to pursue it through an outside agency that they can file a complaint there as well.

415
00:30:20,008 --> 00:30:25,049
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's the council's obligation to file a complaint for, you know, you know what I mean?

416
00:30:25,089 --> 00:30:32,651
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's an individual that's mentioned in the complaint, I think, you know, the materials that were before us kind of spoke a little bit about pursuing outside agency investigation.

417
00:30:32,671 --> 00:30:33,791
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't necessarily

418
00:30:34,630 --> 00:30:38,211
[SPEAKER_05]: indicate that that was the next steps that the individuals were going to take in these complaints.

419
00:30:39,491 --> 00:30:46,994
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, I think we're going down, maybe not us, but me, I'm going down a slippery slope with individuals and this and that and the other thing in the complaints.

420
00:30:47,794 --> 00:30:49,674
[SPEAKER_05]: So with that being said, I'm going to rest my case.

421
00:30:50,195 --> 00:30:53,555
[SPEAKER_05]: I certainly would like to convene an executive session to discuss this matter.

422
00:30:53,636 --> 00:30:54,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I certainly feel as though

423
00:30:55,787 --> 00:31:02,854
[SPEAKER_05]: If it takes us – have it to give a 48-hour notice, then that's what we have to do to go forward and continue with this discussion that we need to have.

424
00:31:02,874 --> 00:31:05,016
[SPEAKER_05]: If that's the process, that's the process.

425
00:31:06,017 --> 00:31:06,517
[SPEAKER_05]: It is what it is.

426
00:31:06,537 --> 00:31:07,238
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the world we live in.

427
00:31:08,179 --> 00:31:12,062
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm certainly open to moving forward in that direction.

428
00:31:13,624 --> 00:31:16,346
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know what anybody else feels on this.

429
00:31:16,707 --> 00:31:20,010
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to take any action that's going to effectuate

430
00:31:23,432 --> 00:31:25,813
[SPEAKER_05]: impact individual's rights here in the community.

431
00:31:25,873 --> 00:31:27,274
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd rather err on the side of caution.

432
00:31:27,294 --> 00:31:31,637
[SPEAKER_05]: These are public employees that do have rights, and, you know, we have to make sure we respect that.

433
00:31:31,737 --> 00:31:36,860
[SPEAKER_05]: So if it just takes 48 hours and a letter of notification, I don't see what harm that causes.

434
00:31:38,301 --> 00:31:45,545
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we would go there, so we would be able to meet at Friday at this time?

435
00:31:48,427 --> 00:31:50,627
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep, 28 hours in advance.

436
00:31:50,948 --> 00:31:53,588
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would have to meet on Friday at six o'clock p.m., correct?

437
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:55,668
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna take me 20 minutes to produce the notice.

438
00:31:55,708 --> 00:31:58,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so clerk has to produce a notice.

439
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:02,030
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then, Councilor Baxter.

440
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:11,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, I agree with what my colleagues are saying, that we've received documentation of a serious nature and that we should have some ability to address it.

441
00:32:12,332 --> 00:32:14,132
[SPEAKER_08]: However, it does seem to me that that's

442
00:32:15,454 --> 00:32:20,276
[SPEAKER_08]: in conflict with the legal role given to this public body under state law.

443
00:32:21,997 --> 00:32:33,162
[SPEAKER_08]: And it sounds to me like if we were to enter executive session to try to discuss next steps, the answers we would receive in that executive session from a solicitor Scanlon would likely be the same answers we've received here and now.

444
00:32:35,293 --> 00:32:49,864
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess, would you be, if we were to enter executive session duly noticed under purpose one, do you expect that you would be able to provide us guidance on legal next steps beyond saying support a third party investigation or refer it to a legal?

445
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,505
[SPEAKER_15]: What's that?

446
00:32:51,545 --> 00:32:55,328
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that literally everything I said tonight would remain the same.

447
00:32:55,568 --> 00:33:00,732
[SPEAKER_08]: And do you feel like there's any additional information you'd be able to provide an executive session that you can't provide here?

448
00:33:01,132 --> 00:33:01,232
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

449
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:05,452
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean... Let's go into executive session on Friday.

450
00:33:06,273 --> 00:33:06,954
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that's fine.

451
00:33:07,094 --> 00:33:16,020
[SPEAKER_08]: It just seems to be that at the end of Friday, the result will be the same, which is, we can say that we want to support a third-party investigation.

452
00:33:16,520 --> 00:33:23,185
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to hire outside legal counsel, which would require appropriation, which we certainly wouldn't have before next Tuesday.

453
00:33:24,486 --> 00:33:26,067
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe, amazingly, we would.

454
00:33:26,207 --> 00:33:27,588
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't expect that to happen.

455
00:33:28,958 --> 00:33:46,450
[SPEAKER_08]: I just think our hands are tied here a little bit, which is difficult, but I just wanted to lay that out because I think we just need to be on the same page that we may enter an executive session Friday evening and leave that session with no more information than we have right now.

456
00:33:47,591 --> 00:33:53,575
[SPEAKER_08]: So we might want to think about how we can act given the information we currently have given that reality.

457
00:34:04,773 --> 00:34:09,115
[SPEAKER_12]: step.

458
00:34:09,215 --> 00:34:12,477
[SPEAKER_12]: I say we move forward to Friday's executive session at six o'clock.

459
00:34:14,017 --> 00:34:18,160
[SPEAKER_12]: I would invite the proper parties and make sure all of our

460
00:34:19,955 --> 00:34:27,262
[SPEAKER_12]: legal responsibilities are in place and we move forward and get some understanding.

461
00:34:27,282 --> 00:34:39,933
[SPEAKER_12]: Because from what I was told is that because this council did get something in that nature is something that we have to, we're obligated to follow through on our end.

462
00:34:40,421 --> 00:34:48,165
[SPEAKER_12]: whether the central administration feels that they see something that they want to have their own investigation, that's theirs.

463
00:34:48,245 --> 00:34:52,468
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think that that's our job as city councils.

464
00:34:52,528 --> 00:35:02,494
[SPEAKER_12]: We have to answer to our constituents and that's why I'm, Steve, is your motion still on the floor?

465
00:35:02,674 --> 00:35:04,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Just one question for the city solicitor.

466
00:35:05,455 --> 00:35:08,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Would there be any prohibition for the council

467
00:35:08,703 --> 00:35:10,605
[SPEAKER_02]: to bring on free legal counsel?

468
00:35:11,105 --> 00:35:22,474
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if we found an attorney that wanted to represent us without going through a process of asking for an allocation from the mayor, would there be anything that would preclude us from doing that?

469
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:25,497
[SPEAKER_15]: I suppose not.

470
00:35:25,517 --> 00:35:27,879
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a little offensive to me, but.

471
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,900
[SPEAKER_02]: To find a pro bono attorney, you say?

472
00:35:31,241 --> 00:35:34,664
[SPEAKER_02]: You were just saying that we have the ability to bring on an attorney, right?

473
00:35:35,525 --> 00:35:36,806
[SPEAKER_15]: With an appropriation, sure.

474
00:35:37,478 --> 00:35:42,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so this is not reflective upon you, it's reflective upon us bringing someone on.

475
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:49,722
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the appropriation doesn't come in a timely fashion, then it doesn't suit its purpose.

476
00:35:49,762 --> 00:36:05,006
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say if we're able to bring on free legal counsel to advise us, right, Mr. President, at the beginning, in particular for this Friday meeting, I don't see any harm in having legal counsel there to represent this council, Mr. President.

477
00:36:12,517 --> 00:36:21,903
[SPEAKER_12]: on working with the council for this issue to show up on Friday's meeting, is that acceptable?

478
00:36:22,343 --> 00:36:23,204
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that the question?

479
00:36:23,944 --> 00:36:24,404
[SPEAKER_02]: More or less.

480
00:36:26,286 --> 00:36:29,528
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm waiting for an answer.

481
00:36:29,548 --> 00:36:30,828
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if anybody has an answer.

482
00:36:42,183 --> 00:36:59,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. President, should the council elect to hire outside legal representation for the purpose of investing a potential criminal matter, what obligations would the administration have to cooperate with this person?

483
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:10,242
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, other than providing documents that are under the over-meeting law, what other requirements would they have to participate in any type of investigation where

484
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:20,705
[SPEAKER_05]: it would be the same as an investigation because we're a public entity in a public body, you know, they're required to participate in this investigation that's been initiated by us.

485
00:37:20,765 --> 00:37:21,966
[SPEAKER_05]: We're with the legislative body.

486
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:23,847
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, are they required?

487
00:37:23,887 --> 00:37:27,269
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't see why anyone would obstruct an investigation by any means.

488
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:32,552
[SPEAKER_15]: Employees are always cooperative, in my opinion.

489
00:37:32,572 --> 00:37:39,796
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, say the council hired an attorney to go and investigate and the attorney wanted to talk to somebody and the person in the city hall said, I'm not talking to you.

490
00:37:40,643 --> 00:37:41,163
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you have to.

491
00:37:41,283 --> 00:37:41,684
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I don't.

492
00:37:41,744 --> 00:37:43,165
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not talking to you.

493
00:37:43,205 --> 00:37:44,145
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not compelled.

494
00:37:45,006 --> 00:37:47,928
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they compelled to participate in any way, shape or form?

495
00:37:47,948 --> 00:37:54,872
[SPEAKER_15]: Not compelled per se, although presumably be noted within the report that is provided by the investigation.

496
00:37:58,595 --> 00:37:59,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Bailão.

497
00:37:59,856 --> 00:38:01,237
[SPEAKER_08]: A few more questions.

498
00:38:01,517 --> 00:38:07,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you believe we could convene in an executive session tonight under purpose five of the OML exemptions for executive session?

499
00:38:08,269 --> 00:38:13,270
[SPEAKER_15]: No, purpose five is to investigate charges of criminal misconduct or the filing of a criminal complaint.

500
00:38:13,370 --> 00:38:17,332
[SPEAKER_08]: So it would have to have been filed, there would have to be a charge on file.

501
00:38:17,752 --> 00:38:18,012
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

502
00:38:18,512 --> 00:38:19,232
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

503
00:38:21,513 --> 00:38:27,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you aware of how the current independent investigation is being funded?

504
00:38:28,034 --> 00:38:32,096
[SPEAKER_08]: What line item is being used to pay for the existing third party investigation?

505
00:38:32,616 --> 00:38:34,516
[SPEAKER_15]: No, it's it just happened today.

506
00:38:34,876 --> 00:38:35,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

507
00:38:36,477 --> 00:38:36,897
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you

508
00:38:37,909 --> 00:38:39,310
[SPEAKER_08]: know when that might begin.

509
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:43,093
[SPEAKER_15]: I would hope by this evening.

510
00:38:43,534 --> 00:38:45,315
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

511
00:38:49,298 --> 00:38:53,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, to me, I would move that

512
00:38:54,508 --> 00:39:03,395
[SPEAKER_08]: or I would, if Councilor Marks's motion is to enter executive session in 48 hours on Friday evening, I could support that as long as it's duly noticed.

513
00:39:04,435 --> 00:39:14,463
[SPEAKER_08]: I also think we should move tonight to say that we support a third party independent investigation into the charges and that we requested appropriation for an outside legal counsel.

514
00:39:14,483 --> 00:39:22,469
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if we take those three actions tonight, we're making a clear step forward within the constraints that we are under.

515
00:39:23,148 --> 00:39:36,416
[SPEAKER_08]: by the open meeting law and general statute and the predicament of the city solicitor as part of the administration, which I think is a constraint on our ability to act as well.

516
00:39:36,596 --> 00:39:38,557
[SPEAKER_08]: So that would be my suggestion as moving forward.

517
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:44,681
[SPEAKER_08]: I would also suggest that we move forward with tonight and tomorrow's budget meetings to stay on track with that.

518
00:39:47,158 --> 00:39:47,938
[SPEAKER_03]: on some oxygen.

519
00:39:47,958 --> 00:39:48,759
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a motion on the floor.

520
00:39:49,619 --> 00:39:50,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I do, Mr President.

521
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a question.

522
00:39:51,140 --> 00:40:00,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, when Kim, when you mentioned about giving ample notice, um, to the parties involved, who does that include?

523
00:40:03,407 --> 00:40:07,149
[SPEAKER_15]: The individuals to be discussed and counsel if they so choose.

524
00:40:07,809 --> 00:40:08,990
[SPEAKER_02]: So who would that be?

525
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:11,711
[SPEAKER_02]: In this case, the individuals discussed.

526
00:40:12,632 --> 00:40:16,134
[SPEAKER_15]: Unfortunately, I can't name names without violating individual rights, which is

527
00:40:17,147 --> 00:40:18,787
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't even know who we're talking about then.

528
00:40:20,608 --> 00:40:21,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, no, really.

529
00:40:21,828 --> 00:40:23,788
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in a meeting where we can't discuss names.

530
00:40:24,209 --> 00:40:25,369
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't discuss anything.

531
00:40:25,729 --> 00:40:30,910
[SPEAKER_02]: So if the parties wanted to waive their rights, they have the ability to do so, correct?

532
00:40:31,650 --> 00:40:31,950
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

533
00:40:33,490 --> 00:40:43,412
[SPEAKER_02]: And would it be parties that brought the claim or would it be parties where?

534
00:40:44,553 --> 00:40:45,933
[SPEAKER_15]: All individuals to be discussed.

535
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:47,430
[SPEAKER_02]: all individuals.

536
00:40:48,331 --> 00:40:51,932
[SPEAKER_02]: So you couldn't have certain members waive their rights.

537
00:40:52,833 --> 00:41:03,238
[SPEAKER_02]: For instance, if the two department heads said, I want to waive my rights and the council has the ability to speak whatever you want to speak, that wouldn't be enough for the open meeting.

538
00:41:03,618 --> 00:41:12,582
[SPEAKER_02]: There would still be a violation of the open meeting because the city administration didn't waive their rights.

539
00:41:16,066 --> 00:41:16,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what I'm saying?

540
00:41:16,946 --> 00:41:23,769
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two sides, one side saying we waive our rights, we have to get the other side naturally to waive their rights, correct?

541
00:41:26,411 --> 00:41:27,471
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm not following that.

542
00:41:29,452 --> 00:41:38,456
[SPEAKER_15]: If one party were to waive their rights, so to speak, which essentially whatever that means is they could opt to have it an open session completely.

543
00:41:38,476 --> 00:41:41,057
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that what you're saying?

544
00:41:41,117 --> 00:41:44,779
[SPEAKER_15]: If someone else were to waive their rights, but another individual chose not to?

545
00:41:45,843 --> 00:41:48,304
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, because there's multiple parties here, correct?

546
00:41:50,705 --> 00:41:52,485
[SPEAKER_15]: There's multiple individuals.

547
00:41:52,665 --> 00:41:53,586
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiple individuals.

548
00:41:53,606 --> 00:41:54,286
[SPEAKER_15]: That can potentially be discussed.

549
00:41:54,806 --> 00:41:55,006
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

550
00:41:55,926 --> 00:42:02,929
[SPEAKER_02]: So if some of them waived their rights and said, we have no problem with the council bringing this up, you know, we don't want to be present.

551
00:42:02,969 --> 00:42:04,729
[SPEAKER_02]: We have no problem with them discussing this.

552
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:09,651
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't suffice because we need everyone to waive their rights.

553
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,101
[SPEAKER_15]: Honestly, I've never been presented with that question before.

554
00:42:16,121 --> 00:42:17,542
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd have to look more on it.

555
00:42:18,243 --> 00:42:19,343
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure that's ever happened.

556
00:42:21,204 --> 00:42:23,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm just, okay, Mr. Pratt.

557
00:42:23,586 --> 00:42:28,429
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fine moving forward with the exec on Friday and the amendments that Councilor Beers put forward.

558
00:42:28,469 --> 00:42:29,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm fine with that.

559
00:42:29,509 --> 00:42:32,531
[SPEAKER_02]: So you wanna make, Councilor Morrell.

560
00:42:33,272 --> 00:42:36,213
[SPEAKER_13]: I just have, it's a question similar Councilor Marks, maybe it's a little more.

561
00:42:36,914 --> 00:42:43,098
[SPEAKER_13]: If parties are unable or unwilling to attend on a Friday, but they were noticed and invited, are we still able to,

562
00:42:43,977 --> 00:42:44,918
[SPEAKER_13]: discuss them or no?

563
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:52,224
[SPEAKER_15]: No, not if they're not, unless they were to wait their right or to say, you know, please carry on.

564
00:42:52,244 --> 00:42:54,205
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not able to attend.

565
00:42:54,285 --> 00:42:59,229
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, that's separate and apart from, you know, stating that, you know, carry on with the meeting.

566
00:42:59,629 --> 00:43:02,231
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's like a potential that could last for 10 years.

567
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:06,635
[SPEAKER_13]: We could invite all, yeah, we could invite all these people and we can't get them to come.

568
00:43:07,475 --> 00:43:08,917
[SPEAKER_13]: So we can't discuss it anyways.

569
00:43:09,757 --> 00:43:13,100
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I would advise you not to discuss the individuals that aren't able to attend.

570
00:43:13,452 --> 00:43:16,293
[SPEAKER_15]: but we could discuss the ones that are able to attend.

571
00:43:16,313 --> 00:43:20,715
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it's getting, I mean, we're just still just talking in numbers.

572
00:43:20,755 --> 00:43:36,461
[SPEAKER_13]: I know it's getting, you know, we're wavering to the hypothetical, but because we're talking a number of parties, I just want to understand, you know, if similar to what Councilor Mark was saying, if some of them cannot attend, but some can, are we able to discuss those who are in attendance or can we not discuss anything?

573
00:43:36,541 --> 00:43:37,482
[SPEAKER_13]: I wouldn't recommend it.

574
00:43:37,502 --> 00:43:37,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

575
00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:42,991
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's a likelihood that we put out this notice we invite these people we still can't have the meeting.

576
00:43:43,472 --> 00:43:43,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Well.

577
00:43:44,233 --> 00:43:50,177
[SPEAKER_04]: Information is present isn't isn't the open meeting what the requirements also around notice notice only.

578
00:43:50,918 --> 00:43:52,820
[SPEAKER_05]: It's we need to notify you that we're talking about you.

579
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:54,301
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to come.

580
00:43:54,883 --> 00:43:55,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Come, if you don't, don't.

581
00:43:56,203 --> 00:43:57,523
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can't be there, you're not there.

582
00:43:57,643 --> 00:44:01,824
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't see why we'd be beholden to their schedule.

583
00:44:02,204 --> 00:44:05,945
[SPEAKER_05]: We're saying, we're giving you the $40 notices provided in the law.

584
00:44:06,265 --> 00:44:07,525
[SPEAKER_05]: The law says we have to give you the notice.

585
00:44:07,605 --> 00:44:08,885
[SPEAKER_05]: That's all we have to do is give you the notice.

586
00:44:08,905 --> 00:44:10,246
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to come, come.

587
00:44:10,266 --> 00:44:10,886
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't, don't.

588
00:44:11,426 --> 00:44:14,026
[SPEAKER_05]: Reach out if you can't make it and tell us you want to reschedule.

589
00:44:14,186 --> 00:44:18,667
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think you can just ignore it and just wait for it to go away.

590
00:44:18,707 --> 00:44:20,167
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think that that's an option.

591
00:44:20,247 --> 00:44:23,008
[SPEAKER_13]: Is the representation about open meeting law or something else, though?

592
00:44:23,148 --> 00:44:25,810
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, the open meeting law is really about notice, right?

593
00:44:25,850 --> 00:44:30,173
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really what it surrounds is what's it's about, you know, what needs to be posted in.

594
00:44:30,373 --> 00:44:31,614
[SPEAKER_13]: Notice within 48 hours.

595
00:44:31,814 --> 00:44:36,056
[SPEAKER_13]: I get that, but is there another legal statute regarding representation that we're wading into?

596
00:44:36,337 --> 00:44:38,438
[SPEAKER_13]: Or this is purely open meeting law we're talking about?

597
00:44:38,458 --> 00:44:40,499
[SPEAKER_15]: This is all open meeting law that I've been discussing.

598
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,922
[SPEAKER_15]: These are all the rights within the open meeting law within an executive session.

599
00:44:44,942 --> 00:44:47,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that makes sense.

600
00:44:47,684 --> 00:44:48,805
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not what Kim said.

601
00:44:49,145 --> 00:44:49,765
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

602
00:44:49,885 --> 00:44:51,947
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you said, but it's not what Kim said.

603
00:44:51,987 --> 00:44:52,147
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

604
00:44:54,108 --> 00:45:00,072
[SPEAKER_02]: He's saying as long as we notice people, it doesn't matter if they show up or not, as long as we notice.

605
00:45:00,733 --> 00:45:02,934
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I mean, you have to give proper notice.

606
00:45:02,994 --> 00:45:04,415
[SPEAKER_15]: They can opt not to attend, sure.

607
00:45:04,915 --> 00:45:07,137
[SPEAKER_15]: I think the question was- Right, but then you said we can't discuss them.

608
00:45:07,157 --> 00:45:10,419
[SPEAKER_15]: Talk about an individual if they're not within that meeting.

609
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:12,781
[SPEAKER_15]: I would just err on the side of caution.

610
00:45:12,841 --> 00:45:13,881
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all I'm saying, council.

611
00:45:14,802 --> 00:45:16,323
[SPEAKER_15]: We're talking about individual rights.

612
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:21,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, but I'm just trying to figure out if we can't discuss them, then why are we having the meeting?

613
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:25,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, I mean.

614
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:27,001
[SPEAKER_15]: Right, that's a valid question.

615
00:45:27,381 --> 00:45:35,103
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I don't know how we'd be able to identify who gets, so who do we, how can we right now determine who even gets notified to come to the thing?

616
00:45:35,123 --> 00:45:36,603
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't, I can't speak about that.

617
00:45:36,623 --> 00:45:38,283
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't name names, how does that work?

618
00:45:41,164 --> 00:45:41,604
I don't know.

619
00:45:42,104 --> 00:45:43,125
[SPEAKER_04]: We need a lawyer.

620
00:45:43,805 --> 00:45:44,465
[SPEAKER_02]: We have one.

621
00:45:44,505 --> 00:45:45,585
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, apparently not me.

622
00:45:45,705 --> 00:45:46,266
[SPEAKER_15]: No, we have one.

623
00:45:46,306 --> 00:45:48,806
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, it's not upon you.

624
00:45:48,866 --> 00:45:51,907
[SPEAKER_02]: We need someone to give us guidance and I don't,

625
00:45:52,957 --> 00:45:54,838
[SPEAKER_02]: So no, it could be the same person.

626
00:45:54,978 --> 00:46:01,501
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to offer a motion then that when the clerk does provide notification of the meeting, that I notify everybody who's mentioned by name in the documents.

627
00:46:04,583 --> 00:46:05,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Council members.

628
00:46:05,543 --> 00:46:08,845
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think we are getting guidance to be quite frank.

629
00:46:09,605 --> 00:46:12,906
[SPEAKER_08]: I understand it's not the guidance I think any of us want to hear, but it is the guidance we're getting.

630
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:20,010
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess my question would just be,

631
00:46:22,515 --> 00:46:37,241
[SPEAKER_08]: if we were to discuss individuals on a properly noticed meeting who did not attend, would the only, would there be an outcome other than having an open meeting law complaint filed against this council?

632
00:46:38,621 --> 00:46:41,262
[SPEAKER_08]: Could the council be subject to litigation?

633
00:46:41,903 --> 00:46:43,043
[SPEAKER_15]: Other than- We could be fined.

634
00:46:43,063 --> 00:46:45,444
[SPEAKER_08]: We could be fined by through the- By the division of open government.

635
00:46:46,124 --> 00:46:47,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, through the open meeting law.

636
00:46:48,525 --> 00:46:48,785
[SPEAKER_15]: Correct.

637
00:46:49,066 --> 00:46:49,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, but so,

638
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:53,734
[SPEAKER_08]: there could be an open meeting law complaint filed, we could be fined.

639
00:46:54,654 --> 00:46:56,515
[SPEAKER_08]: Could other litigation be filed other than that?

640
00:46:59,037 --> 00:46:59,717
[SPEAKER_15]: Potentially.

641
00:47:00,238 --> 00:47:01,158
[SPEAKER_08]: Potentially, okay.

642
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:05,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's the answer I thought you'd give.

643
00:47:05,801 --> 00:47:06,962
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just an open question, right?

644
00:47:07,482 --> 00:47:07,662
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.

645
00:47:07,682 --> 00:47:09,163
[SPEAKER_08]: People can pretty much sue over anything.

646
00:47:10,524 --> 00:47:10,864
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

647
00:47:13,085 --> 00:47:16,887
[SPEAKER_03]: So, Councilor Mox, you have a motion on the floor.

648
00:47:18,535 --> 00:47:23,799
[SPEAKER_02]: The motion that I put forward was to meet in exact on Friday at 6.30, I believe, depending on the time now.

649
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:27,441
[SPEAKER_03]: With the amendments made by Councilor Baez.

650
00:47:27,461 --> 00:47:30,163
[SPEAKER_02]: With the amendments made by Councilor, three amendments, I believe he put forth.

651
00:47:30,383 --> 00:47:45,773
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd also like to further end the amendment, Mr. President, with addition to legal counsel, outside financial audit might be appropriate as well, whether or not there's a public account of some sort that we could also take a look at related to the finance aspect of the complaint.

652
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:50,348
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have constant nights and also bears you want to repeat yours.

653
00:47:52,189 --> 00:47:54,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Also bears you want to repeat your amendments to the clerk, please.

654
00:47:54,891 --> 00:47:55,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, my amendments.

655
00:47:55,672 --> 00:48:04,879
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's to it was that we support an outside third party investigation into the legal and personnel matters received by the council.

656
00:48:06,340 --> 00:48:07,461
[SPEAKER_08]: And, yeah.

657
00:48:21,177 --> 00:48:32,284
[SPEAKER_08]: and that we request that the city, that the mayor appropriate funds to the council for an outside legal council, council with an I, council with an E, respectively.

658
00:48:36,467 --> 00:48:41,130
[SPEAKER_08]: My third suggestion was just that we continue forward with budget meetings, which I don't think needs to be a part of this.

659
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:43,031
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

660
00:48:43,071 --> 00:48:44,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Moxley, you comfortable with that?

661
00:48:44,492 --> 00:48:45,032
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm comfortable.

662
00:48:45,093 --> 00:48:50,296
[SPEAKER_03]: So the motion by Councilor Moxley is amended by Councilor Behrs and amended by Councilor Knight.

663
00:48:51,575 --> 00:48:52,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by?

664
00:48:54,597 --> 00:48:55,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

665
00:48:55,797 --> 00:49:07,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

666
00:49:12,127 --> 00:49:12,367
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

667
00:49:12,387 --> 00:49:12,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

668
00:49:13,127 --> 00:49:13,408
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

669
00:49:14,068 --> 00:49:14,508
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

670
00:49:14,688 --> 00:49:14,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

671
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,897
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

672
00:49:23,997 --> 00:49:24,197
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

673
00:49:24,217 --> 00:49:25,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Send me affirmative motion passes.

674
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:34,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, here and on zoom.

675
00:49:34,883 --> 00:49:35,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President.

676
00:49:35,544 --> 00:49:37,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, who would like to speak?

677
00:49:38,686 --> 00:49:39,126
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening.

678
00:49:40,827 --> 00:49:42,268
[SPEAKER_03]: My name address of the record, please.

679
00:49:45,810 --> 00:49:46,510
[SPEAKER_11]: Evening counselors.

680
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:50,793
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, Mike Durham, director of veteran services, 85 George V has to drive from 100.

681
00:49:52,907 --> 00:50:00,171
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, just been advised by my attorney to let you know that we are totally fine with you proceeding in an open forum.

682
00:50:00,191 --> 00:50:05,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I believe Alicia is on the zoom call right now to confirm that as well.

683
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:09,075
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, our attorneys in route so you can speak to him directly.

684
00:50:09,095 --> 00:50:10,776
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you have any questions for me?

685
00:50:12,396 --> 00:50:15,858
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, questions for Mike.

686
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:24,162
[SPEAKER_05]: just to let you know that we're going to be convening in 48 hours time to discuss the matter in an executive session.

687
00:50:24,862 --> 00:50:34,304
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to be notifying you and your counsel as well as other individuals mentioned in the complaint as to the time and date of the meeting and we hope to see you there.

688
00:50:39,812 --> 00:50:44,855
[SPEAKER_08]: without getting into specifics, that I think we all take these, the documents that we received very seriously.

689
00:50:45,335 --> 00:50:50,278
[SPEAKER_08]: And personally, I would just thank both of you for your work for the city.

690
00:50:50,939 --> 00:50:53,620
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think I can say more than that right now, but we take this seriously.

691
00:50:55,401 --> 00:50:55,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

692
00:50:56,782 --> 00:50:57,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further questions?

693
00:50:59,144 --> 00:51:00,745
[SPEAKER_03]: Alicia, did you want to speak?

694
00:51:01,545 --> 00:51:04,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Clerk, could you please unmute Alicia Downey, please?

695
00:51:05,808 --> 00:51:06,368
[SPEAKER_03]: She's up on the top.

696
00:51:15,524 --> 00:51:16,565
[SPEAKER_03]: She's on her iPhone.

697
00:51:16,645 --> 00:51:20,146
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a picture of her.

698
00:51:20,186 --> 00:51:21,166
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon, councillors.

699
00:51:21,266 --> 00:51:35,590
[SPEAKER_00]: I echo what Michael said and I heard what was said in the council and I did receive the email for the open meeting law notice that went to everyone along with the posting that the clerk did.

700
00:51:35,690 --> 00:51:38,471
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are aware and we do waive.

701
00:51:38,491 --> 00:51:41,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

702
00:51:41,652 --> 00:51:41,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

703
00:51:43,279 --> 00:51:46,522
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to reschedule this for Friday, correct?

704
00:51:47,823 --> 00:51:48,684
[SPEAKER_03]: To protect all parties?

705
00:51:50,425 --> 00:51:53,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, Mr. President.

706
00:51:53,688 --> 00:51:58,172
[SPEAKER_03]: The clerk is going to go downstairs and do a filing for Friday.

707
00:51:59,053 --> 00:52:09,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, just to clarify, if we could, even if we wanted to discuss this in an open meeting, I think the city solicitor said all parties had to agree.

708
00:52:09,702 --> 00:52:10,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?

709
00:52:15,871 --> 00:52:16,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

710
00:52:16,251 --> 00:52:23,557
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so even though some of the parties are waiving their rights, Mr. President, I believe all parties have to be notified.

711
00:52:24,017 --> 00:52:25,078
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 48 hour notice.

712
00:52:25,118 --> 00:52:31,123
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, that's going to preclude us from discussing this at a public session.

713
00:52:33,745 --> 00:52:33,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

714
00:52:33,965 --> 00:52:34,485
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't.

715
00:52:35,506 --> 00:52:44,273
[SPEAKER_09]: I asked the city solicitor for some help in, in, uh, making sure that I provide this notification in the proper way, because I don't want, I want to make sure that rights are protected here.

716
00:52:46,172 --> 00:52:46,492
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

717
00:52:47,613 --> 00:52:48,013
[SPEAKER_11]: Go back.

718
00:52:50,054 --> 00:52:57,978
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to say that, um, there was enough time to hire an independent investigator and have outside consultations.

719
00:52:58,198 --> 00:53:03,640
[SPEAKER_11]: But, um, I guess not enough time to appear before this body tonight.

720
00:53:04,261 --> 00:53:09,923
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, I understand your decision, but I want you to know I'm happy to have this out in the open.

721
00:53:11,724 --> 00:53:12,885
[SPEAKER_11]: Everything looks better in the light.

722
00:53:12,905 --> 00:53:14,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

723
00:53:14,485 --> 00:53:14,805
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

724
00:53:15,486 --> 00:53:15,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

725
00:53:16,865 --> 00:53:21,909
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mr. Clerk, I know you're behind the gun right now.

726
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:23,370
[SPEAKER_14]: Can I ask one last question?

727
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:29,095
[SPEAKER_14]: It's actually for the city solicitor.

728
00:53:29,375 --> 00:53:38,423
[SPEAKER_14]: If I may, I believe you mentioned that there was an attorney already hired to spearhead an investigation.

729
00:53:40,745 --> 00:53:43,467
[SPEAKER_14]: So with that attorney that was hired

730
00:53:46,838 --> 00:53:50,220
[SPEAKER_14]: How do we know that there aren't any conflicts in the hiring, I guess?

731
00:53:52,322 --> 00:54:09,813
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so you did the due diligence to just go through the process and make sure that they had no conflicts with regard to what they were going to be investigating and who they were going to be investigating.

732
00:54:13,658 --> 00:54:17,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, as I stated, we don't know the scope of the investigation either.

733
00:54:17,539 --> 00:54:17,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

734
00:54:18,139 --> 00:54:18,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

735
00:54:18,359 --> 00:54:20,960
[SPEAKER_02]: So we know there's an investigation.

736
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,480
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know to what extent.

737
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:28,262
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that should be something that, you know, we're made aware of, Mr. President.

738
00:54:29,482 --> 00:54:41,865
[SPEAKER_08]: Mr. President, would it be possible for this council to receive a documentation of the scope of the third party investigation or whatever agreement has been entered into with the investigator?

739
00:54:51,172 --> 00:54:53,674
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no, I gotcha.

740
00:54:53,954 --> 00:54:55,736
[SPEAKER_14]: If I may, if I may, Councilor Beers, could you?

741
00:54:58,298 --> 00:55:00,960
[SPEAKER_14]: Councilor Beers, if you could please repeat that question, I didn't quite hear it.

742
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:19,995
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, is it possible that the council could receive a copy of the scope provided or requested by, of the third party investigator or a copy of any legal, you know, legal agreement, memorandum of understanding, whatever the document might be, contract between the city and the third party investigator.

743
00:55:24,105 --> 00:55:26,546
[SPEAKER_09]: What was the solicitor's response?

744
00:55:26,586 --> 00:55:27,266
[SPEAKER_15]: I think it's fine.

745
00:55:27,346 --> 00:55:29,107
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure it would state.

746
00:55:29,847 --> 00:55:33,948
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not sure I would have anything in writing at this particular time that would state the scope.

747
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:35,789
[SPEAKER_15]: It was more of a verbal conversation.

748
00:55:37,469 --> 00:55:46,892
[SPEAKER_15]: What I could provide is a letter of retainer, I suppose, but it wouldn't specify your particular question.

749
00:55:48,172 --> 00:55:50,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it comes to this question.

750
00:55:51,113 --> 00:55:53,894
[SPEAKER_03]: The independent counsel is obviously charged with some

751
00:55:55,053 --> 00:56:18,278
[SPEAKER_03]: uh duties or scope so all right there has to be something and the same has been true mr president with other investigations done in the community uh and the attorney wasn't hired just to do nothing so they've they've been charged with some scope i i mean i would respect the scope would be to conduct an independent investigation based upon the information that i provided right

752
00:56:18,705 --> 00:56:31,055
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I would just respect the request, whatever, any written agreements entered into between the city and the investigator, either that have already been entered into or that will be entered into, be provided to the council, a copy be provided to the council.

753
00:56:31,355 --> 00:56:32,777
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'd make that a formal motion.

754
00:56:35,479 --> 00:56:38,361
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by Councilor Bess, seconded by Councilor Morrell.

755
00:56:39,442 --> 00:56:40,102
[SPEAKER_03]: All those in favor?

756
00:56:40,983 --> 00:56:41,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

757
00:56:41,123 --> 00:56:42,384
[SPEAKER_03]: All those opposed?

758
00:56:43,425 --> 00:56:43,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

759
00:56:44,006 --> 00:56:46,308
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

760
00:56:46,848 --> 00:56:47,549
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, Mr. Clerk.

761
00:56:48,733 --> 00:56:49,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion to adjourn?

762
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:51,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Motion to adjourn, Mr. President.

763
00:56:51,634 --> 00:56:55,455
[SPEAKER_03]: On the motion by council, motion to adjourn, seconded by Councilor Baez.

764
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,035
[SPEAKER_03]: All in favor?

765
00:56:56,795 --> 00:56:56,875
[SPEAKER_03]: Aye.

766
00:56:56,916 --> 00:56:57,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Opposed?

767
00:56:57,316 --> 00:56:57,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Motion passes.

768
00:56:58,596 --> 00:57:04,858
[SPEAKER_03]: For those in the audience, the clerk is going to need a few minutes to get some stuff done.

769
00:57:05,238 --> 00:57:08,099
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're probably going to be delayed about 30 minutes, OK?
