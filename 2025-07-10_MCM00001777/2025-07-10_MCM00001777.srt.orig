1
00:00:05,402 --> 00:00:05,983
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening, everyone.

2
00:00:06,003 --> 00:00:06,643
[SPEAKER_07]: Can people hear me?

3
00:00:08,885 --> 00:00:09,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, good.

4
00:00:09,706 --> 00:00:12,528
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

5
00:00:14,649 --> 00:00:18,152
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not on my normal computer, so I'm a little out of sorts.

6
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:24,697
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to the Conservation Commission meeting for July 9th, 2025.

7
00:00:43,965 --> 00:01:05,022
[SPEAKER_07]: First item on the agenda is a notice of intent for 99 river beach parkway TPC land acquisition company LOP has filed a notice of intent for a proposed redevelopment 97 and 99 river beach parkway redevelopment proposal includes the demolition of existing radio station an existing radio station building parking lots and associated structures and construction of a new

8
00:01:06,222 --> 00:01:12,086
[SPEAKER_07]: 352,400 gross square foot transit-oriented multi-family residential building with ground floor retail and structured parking.

9
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:27,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Additional site improvements include a new stormwater management system, waterfront public access waterways, walkways, wildlife habitat enhancements, a portion of the properties within the 200-foot riverfront area, including the Malden River, and the 100-foot buffer zones, top of bank, and bordering vegetation.

10
00:01:31,298 --> 00:01:31,798
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Denny.

11
00:01:32,624 --> 00:01:33,525
[SPEAKER_10]: Denny, excuse me.

12
00:01:35,866 --> 00:01:37,147
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never called you that before.

13
00:01:39,008 --> 00:01:39,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Quite all right.

14
00:01:42,190 --> 00:01:44,551
[SPEAKER_10]: Before we start, a bit of housekeeping.

15
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:49,654
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to mention that this project does not have a DEP file number associated with it yet.

16
00:01:50,775 --> 00:01:53,076
[SPEAKER_10]: And apparently, there is an outstanding balance.

17
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:57,839
[SPEAKER_10]: So I suggest you contact the Northeast Regional Office to try and resolve that.

18
00:02:04,294 --> 00:02:07,116
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, shall I jump into the presentation?

19
00:02:07,877 --> 00:02:08,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Please do.

20
00:02:09,978 --> 00:02:12,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Dennis, I just requested screen sharing.

21
00:02:13,761 --> 00:02:14,221
[SPEAKER_07]: Good to go.

22
00:02:15,442 --> 00:02:15,922
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

23
00:02:20,365 --> 00:02:22,787
[SPEAKER_10]: If you could introduce yourself, please, we'd appreciate it.

24
00:02:23,147 --> 00:02:24,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

25
00:02:24,208 --> 00:02:25,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Can everyone see my screen?

26
00:02:25,409 --> 00:02:25,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

27
00:02:27,923 --> 00:02:29,363
[SPEAKER_02]: My name's Natty King.

28
00:02:29,463 --> 00:02:32,984
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an environmental planner with Fort Point Associates.

29
00:02:33,524 --> 00:02:40,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Here to present on the 97-99 Revere Beach Parkway Notice of Intent.

30
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:45,606
[SPEAKER_02]: The applicant for this project is CPC Land Acquisition Company, LLC.

31
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:52,647
[SPEAKER_02]: And with us today from that firm is Jack Englert and Eric Von Arum.

32
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:56,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Would either of you like to say an opening remark?

33
00:02:58,777 --> 00:02:59,858
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to do so.

34
00:02:59,998 --> 00:03:01,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for having us tonight.

35
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:05,583
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized we've been kind of starting and stopping here.

36
00:03:05,663 --> 00:03:12,508
[SPEAKER_01]: And the explanation for that is just in this environment, equity has been a little difficult.

37
00:03:12,689 --> 00:03:25,399
[SPEAKER_01]: We have recently signed a term sheet for the equity on this project, which doesn't sound like a big step, but it's a huge step for us because we've been trying to do so for the last several years.

38
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:33,425
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, we're anticipating getting through that process with that particular group and moving forward.

39
00:03:33,445 --> 00:03:39,088
[SPEAKER_01]: And we appreciate all the patience that you've had with us on this project from day one.

40
00:03:39,148 --> 00:03:40,609
[SPEAKER_01]: It has been a long slug.

41
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,612
[SPEAKER_01]: And just wanted to thank you all for that.

42
00:03:46,443 --> 00:03:47,083
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Jack.

43
00:03:48,605 --> 00:03:58,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Also here today is my colleague, Jamie Fay from Fort Point Associates and Brian Cullinan, who's covering for our civil engineer, Nate Scheel.

44
00:03:59,412 --> 00:04:00,793
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have J.P.

45
00:04:00,853 --> 00:04:03,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Shadley and John Gloads from Shadley Associates.

46
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:06,117
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the landscape architect for the project.

47
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,883
[SPEAKER_02]: So today we'll cover existing conditions of the site.

48
00:04:12,383 --> 00:04:14,985
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll summarize the project overview.

49
00:04:15,606 --> 00:04:23,492
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get into resource area impacts and compliance with performance standards, discuss stormwater and construction period.

50
00:04:23,532 --> 00:04:27,235
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we'll have time for questions and discussion from the commission at the end.

51
00:04:29,615 --> 00:04:39,410
[SPEAKER_02]: So existing conditions, as I mentioned, the sites 97 and 99 Revere Beach Parkway, you may know it as the former kiss 108 radio station.

52
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:52,424
[SPEAKER_02]: It's located immediately adjacent to the MBTA Wellington Orange Line station, which is just off page to the southwest on this aerial photograph.

53
00:04:53,404 --> 00:05:00,747
[SPEAKER_02]: To the east of the site is the Malden River, and to the north of the site is Revere Beach Parkway and the Woods Memorial Bridge.

54
00:05:01,687 --> 00:05:12,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Also north of the site is an existing DCR public access walkway that passes under the Woods Memorial Bridge and travels to points north.

55
00:05:12,236 --> 00:05:18,921
[SPEAKER_02]: The site is developed with a radio station building, footprint of about 9,000 square feet.

56
00:05:20,322 --> 00:05:30,210
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also occupied by two parking lots, a turf lawn area, and several utility and radio broadcast structures.

57
00:05:31,094 --> 00:05:32,125
[SPEAKER_02]: um the

58
00:05:33,741 --> 00:05:44,446
[SPEAKER_02]: The rig also within the site is the vegetated Malden River shoreline that you can see along the eastern boundary here and in this bottom right photograph.

59
00:05:45,107 --> 00:05:48,328
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, it's not in great shape.

60
00:05:48,408 --> 00:05:52,010
[SPEAKER_02]: It has quite a bit of accumulated litter and debris.

61
00:05:52,230 --> 00:06:01,715
[SPEAKER_02]: Cleaning that up is an important intent of the project among with overall site improvements of this previously developed property.

62
00:06:04,436 --> 00:06:13,499
[SPEAKER_02]: So project overview, the applicant is proposing a six story, 350,000 gross square foot multifamily residential building.

63
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:21,663
[SPEAKER_02]: As I mentioned, it's closely proximate to the Wellington Orange Line Station, a great site for multifamily residential development.

64
00:06:22,543 --> 00:06:30,226
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll also include a subsurface parking garage and retail along the Western building perimeter.

65
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:38,156
[SPEAKER_02]: A key component of the project is to expand shoreline public access along the Malden River.

66
00:06:38,756 --> 00:06:43,460
[SPEAKER_02]: So to that end, we're proposing a network of publicly accessible walkways.

67
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Those will connect to that existing DCR walkway to the north and a proposed future DCR walkway to the south.

68
00:06:53,388 --> 00:07:02,115
[SPEAKER_02]: The intent being to help open up public access to this site for the first time and help complete a missing link in the regional greenway network.

69
00:07:02,876 --> 00:07:13,225
[SPEAKER_02]: We have been coordinating with DCR leading up to this filing to coordinate our design with the other walkways planned by DCR for the area.

70
00:07:14,545 --> 00:07:24,867
[SPEAKER_02]: Beyond that, we are including a landscaping program that includes native vegetation and wildlife and pollinator habitat.

71
00:07:26,628 --> 00:07:34,910
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also proposing, as I mentioned, improvement to the Malden River shoreline, removing invasive species and litter in that area.

72
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:44,372
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, a new stormwater management system, including infiltration provisions, which I'll talk about as I move through the presentation.

73
00:07:46,786 --> 00:07:49,867
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's an illustrative site plan for the project.

74
00:07:50,688 --> 00:07:55,270
[SPEAKER_02]: The building is this orange in the middle along the western edge of the site.

75
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:59,592
[SPEAKER_02]: The building will be surrounded by a courtyard level with a swimming pool.

76
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:06,735
[SPEAKER_02]: To the west of the building are vehicular circulation drives, including access to the subsurface

77
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:07,476
[SPEAKER_02]: parking lot.

78
00:08:08,376 --> 00:08:20,867
[SPEAKER_02]: And then moving east, we have a stairway down to the building, which will bring residents and others from the building down to the new publicly accessible network of pedestrian walkways.

79
00:08:22,528 --> 00:08:26,311
[SPEAKER_02]: Surrounding that will be a mix of lawn and native landscaping.

80
00:08:26,592 --> 00:08:33,778
[SPEAKER_02]: And south of the building will be the wildlife and pollinator habitat area that I'll talk about in a little more detail later on.

81
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:50,390
[SPEAKER_02]: And then along the Malden River shoreline, kind of east of this lightly dashed line that you'll be able to see better later on is that area where we're proposing the shoreline improvements, primarily cleaning it up to improve its condition.

82
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,811
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's a section view through the building.

83
00:08:54,871 --> 00:09:18,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe this was requested by the commission when we presented this project informally several months ago, but this shows grades transitioning down from the building about at elevation 15, lowering down to elevation 12 to a pedestrian walkway through some landscape areas, another pedestrian walkway at elevation nine,

84
00:09:20,162 --> 00:09:26,954
[SPEAKER_02]: To the page right of that is a stormwater discharge point, a level spreader outlet that I'll talk about later.

85
00:09:27,956 --> 00:09:31,703
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to the right of that is the Malden River shoreline.

86
00:09:34,543 --> 00:09:48,947
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of resource area impacts within the project site, we have a number of inland wetland resource areas that includes bank bordering vegetated wetlands and bordering land subject to flooding.

87
00:09:49,967 --> 00:09:57,669
[SPEAKER_02]: These resource areas will have no direct impact from construction related to the walkway or the building.

88
00:09:58,690 --> 00:09:59,690
[SPEAKER_02]: So that leaves us with

89
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:06,732
[SPEAKER_02]: the 100-foot buffer zone and the 200-foot riverfront area where portions of the project work will occur.

90
00:10:07,492 --> 00:10:15,914
[SPEAKER_02]: That includes about 25,000 square feet of impacts within the previously developed riverfront area and 45,000 square feet of temporary impacts.

91
00:10:19,238 --> 00:10:25,920
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for the buffer zone, 9,000 square feet of permanent impacts and 27,000 square feet of temporary impacts.

92
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:34,044
[SPEAKER_02]: So that includes walkway construction, landscaping, and construction of the building along the Western edge of the riverfront area.

93
00:10:37,425 --> 00:10:45,928
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of compliance with the performance standards, so the publicly accessible walkways are exempt from the riverfront performance standards.

94
00:10:46,669 --> 00:10:54,334
[SPEAKER_02]: as is work within Chapter 91 jurisdiction, which includes limited portions of the site, really just the walkway area.

95
00:10:54,414 --> 00:11:09,205
[SPEAKER_02]: So no need to get into detail on that, but we have obtained a administrative approval from the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection Waterways Program for the portion of work that's within Chapter 91 jurisdiction.

96
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:31,486
[SPEAKER_02]: So that leaves us with the building footprint, the stairway connecting from the building to the shoreline walkways, and then several gravity walls to assist with grade transitions as the new impervious surfaces subject to the performance standards that will occur within riverfront area.

97
00:11:32,213 --> 00:11:41,868
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the remainder of the work is temporary impacts with vegetated surfaces, much of which is native landscaping being the finished site condition.

98
00:11:45,159 --> 00:11:52,764
[SPEAKER_02]: So existing degraded riverfront areas, about 9,800 square feet, that's shown in blue in this graphic on the screen.

99
00:11:53,304 --> 00:12:13,897
[SPEAKER_02]: That includes the radio station building footprint, some paved areas and utility structures and outbuildings immediately north and east of it, a small portion of the radio station parking lot, and then the radio station's two broadcast towers in the turf lawn area to the south of the building.

100
00:12:18,136 --> 00:12:32,108
[SPEAKER_02]: So our proposed work that I mentioned, the building footprint stairway and gravity walls total approximately 13,000 square feet in riverfront area that exceeds existing degraded by about 3,000 square feet.

101
00:12:32,488 --> 00:12:36,612
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're proposing a mitigation program to offset that exceedance.

102
00:12:40,617 --> 00:12:44,478
[SPEAKER_02]: All told, we're proposing about 20,000 square feet of mitigation.

103
00:12:44,539 --> 00:12:53,722
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about a 6 to 1 ratio of mitigation to exceedance of existing degraded, going well beyond the 2 to 1 required.

104
00:12:55,323 --> 00:12:57,043
[SPEAKER_02]: This comprises two areas.

105
00:12:57,123 --> 00:13:03,806
[SPEAKER_02]: So one is the wildlife and pollinator habitat area, where my cursor is now, south of the proposed building.

106
00:13:04,498 --> 00:13:18,663
[SPEAKER_02]: That area will be improved with a mix of native trees, shrubs, and herbaceous plants that's intended to support the riverfront area functions and values and provide enhanced habitat compared to the existing lawn condition in that area.

107
00:13:19,343 --> 00:13:21,804
[SPEAKER_02]: And that specific component is about 11,000 square feet.

108
00:13:25,443 --> 00:13:32,609
[SPEAKER_02]: The second portion of the mitigation program is the shoreline cleanup shown in red in this image on the right.

109
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:41,938
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's an area that's significantly impacted by invasive species, also significantly accumulated litter and debris from

110
00:13:42,478 --> 00:13:45,300
[SPEAKER_02]: years of neglect and under maintenance.

111
00:13:45,681 --> 00:13:58,931
[SPEAKER_02]: We're proposing to clean that up, remove the invasive species, remove the litter, and reseed the areas that we've removed the invasive species from with a native conservation seed mix, and that's about 9,700 square feet in total.

112
00:14:04,209 --> 00:14:21,922
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of the stormwater management system, what's shown on my screen, green are subsurface pipes, the yellow squares are catch basins or area drains, the blue are subsurface infiltration systems, and the orange is the level spreader outlet.

113
00:14:22,763 --> 00:14:30,049
[SPEAKER_02]: So this comprises two separate catchment areas, one covering the northern half of the site and one covering the southern half.

114
00:14:31,129 --> 00:14:41,193
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of them, both of these catchment areas have water quality devices to treat stormwater that runs off of paved areas for vehicular circulation.

115
00:14:42,313 --> 00:14:51,737
[SPEAKER_02]: It's conveyed to the subsurface infiltration system and then stormwater in excess of the capacity of those systems for the northern

116
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:59,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Catchment area will be conveyed off site and tied into the existing drainage system under the Wellington Station access road.

117
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:07,103
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the southern system will be discharged to a new level spreader, that orange oval in the southern portion of the site.

118
00:15:07,984 --> 00:15:16,067
[SPEAKER_02]: The intent of that design component is to allow the stormwater to discharge without having to build a new outfall in the Malden River.

119
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,448
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows us to set it back

120
00:15:18,648 --> 00:15:29,253
[SPEAKER_02]: from the shoreline, and it includes riprap that will slow down and dissipate the velocity of stormwater discharge and allow it to gently flow over land into the Malden River.

121
00:15:30,673 --> 00:15:42,939
[SPEAKER_02]: This system's compliant with the Massachusetts Stormwater Management Standards and will improve over the site's existing condition, which includes significant paved areas without any drainage features.

122
00:15:46,458 --> 00:16:11,974
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of the construction period, proposing perimeter controls, including compost filter tubes, construction fence with a windscreen both surrounding the site to prevent sediments and fugitive dust from impacting resource areas, catch basin inlet protection to prevent sediments from being conveyed into the drainage system,

123
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:23,717
[SPEAKER_02]: crushed rocks, stabilized construction exit, stabilization of slopes, and stabilized soil stockpiles, among other measures outlined in the NOI.

124
00:16:26,678 --> 00:16:32,603
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, just to sum it all up, this project will expand public access to the Malden River.

125
00:16:33,084 --> 00:16:41,611
[SPEAKER_02]: It will expand wildlife and pollinator habitat, and it will greatly improve stormwater management at this previously developed site.

126
00:16:41,951 --> 00:16:45,734
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that, I welcome any questions from the commission.

127
00:16:49,497 --> 00:16:50,258
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. King.

128
00:16:53,613 --> 00:16:58,676
[SPEAKER_10]: I open it up to the commission for questions or comments.

129
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:11,743
[SPEAKER_04]: Who wants to start?

130
00:17:13,544 --> 00:17:14,884
[SPEAKER_04]: There is some weird echo.

131
00:17:14,904 --> 00:17:18,626
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if others can hear it.

132
00:17:19,727 --> 00:17:21,388
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, I think we're all echoing.

133
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:26,181
[SPEAKER_10]: So it must be at the call.

134
00:17:29,662 --> 00:17:32,262
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess I'll start, unless nobody else wants to go.

135
00:17:32,282 --> 00:17:36,743
[SPEAKER_08]: I have just a simple question about the level spreader design, Natty.

136
00:17:37,303 --> 00:17:40,564
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a section provided in your permit plans.

137
00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:46,145
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just unclear to me how it's stabilized.

138
00:17:46,185 --> 00:17:50,786
[SPEAKER_08]: I've seen level spreaders where there's a spreader bar at the sort of downward

139
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,721
[SPEAKER_08]: edge of the outlet.

140
00:17:53,562 --> 00:17:59,066
[SPEAKER_08]: And it appears that you're just using soil to create that berm, for lack of a better term.

141
00:17:59,086 --> 00:18:11,895
[SPEAKER_08]: I just want to make sure that that design is stabilized so that the downward edge of the basin isn't susceptible to slumping or washing.

142
00:18:13,737 --> 00:18:28,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I, I believe the design intent is to have the rip rap at the discharge point services that velocity dissipation area and our engineer Nate did let me know that stormwater.

143
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:32,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Passing over that area will be slowed down to a velocity of under.

144
00:18:33,233 --> 00:18:36,434
[SPEAKER_02]: two feet per second, which is a non-erosive velocity.

145
00:18:36,514 --> 00:18:47,757
[SPEAKER_02]: So by the time it passes outside of the riprap area, it'll be slowed down and is not expected to cause erosive impacts down gradient from the outlet point.

146
00:18:48,658 --> 00:18:49,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

147
00:18:49,038 --> 00:18:49,838
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.

148
00:18:50,835 --> 00:18:52,937
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, and I apologize if I'm jumping around.

149
00:18:52,997 --> 00:19:02,326
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know if any of my fellow commissioners have questions about stormwater if we want to stay on that topic, but, um, I do have questions about the invasive species monitoring.

150
00:19:03,227 --> 00:19:04,088
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so I'll stop there.

151
00:19:04,128 --> 00:19:09,833
[SPEAKER_08]: If anybody, uh, I'm sure Craig's on, he's much more detail oriented on the stormwater than I am.

152
00:19:09,893 --> 00:19:13,537
[SPEAKER_08]: So maybe we can swing over to him if he has questions.

153
00:19:15,245 --> 00:19:15,965
[SPEAKER_08]: order.

154
00:19:16,105 --> 00:19:17,926
[SPEAKER_05]: You have me pegged, it seems.

155
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:27,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I've got a handful of questions about the stormwater drainage design and specifically the infiltration arrays.

156
00:19:28,068 --> 00:19:43,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the slide that you have up right now, as well as the overall landscaping plan that I believe was page 72 to your NOI

157
00:19:45,933 --> 00:19:52,275
[SPEAKER_05]: I am a huge fan of what you guys are doing with your mitigation plan.

158
00:19:53,695 --> 00:20:10,599
[SPEAKER_05]: My concern is, you know, flipping between what we're seeing on the screen now and what we have on the slide you just had up, is at the very least, that southern infiltration array looks to have maybe a foot of cover above it.

159
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:17,355
[SPEAKER_05]: like with, you know, six inches of cover to a foot and a half of cover.

160
00:20:18,376 --> 00:20:28,622
[SPEAKER_05]: And that is being slated to have native trees and shrubs and somewhat dense vegetation to be put on top of it.

161
00:20:31,044 --> 00:20:38,608
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a little concerned about root impact messing with the efficacy and function of those infiltration arrays.

162
00:20:38,628 --> 00:20:39,609
[SPEAKER_05]: So

163
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:49,213
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be interested to hear whether the applicant team thinks that's an issue.

164
00:20:49,553 --> 00:21:09,448
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would also like to see the stormwater subgrade somewhat be wrapped into what that landscaping plan looks like, because I think planting any tree of appreciable size with a foot of cover is going to result in impacts in five years.

165
00:21:11,663 --> 00:21:12,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly.

166
00:21:12,143 --> 00:21:13,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we appreciate that.

167
00:21:13,725 --> 00:21:23,412
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think to some extent what you're seeing in this section view kind of, it's not exactly everything that's directly on the cut, right?

168
00:21:23,432 --> 00:21:25,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it's a little set back from it.

169
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:38,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we did build up the cover over the infiltration system to at least accommodate some lower type plantings, like shrubs at the very least.

170
00:21:39,243 --> 00:21:47,188
[SPEAKER_02]: without larger trees intended to be sited in that area that may grow down and impact the infiltration system.

171
00:21:47,288 --> 00:21:50,850
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do have our landscape architect, JP Shadley here.

172
00:21:50,890 --> 00:21:55,353
[SPEAKER_02]: JP, would you like to say a word about that while we're on the topic?

173
00:21:58,635 --> 00:21:59,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Or John Gloads?

174
00:22:04,872 --> 00:22:21,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Natty's right that the section, if we were to blow up and go right in there, some of the areas have three or four feet actually of cover over and we concentrated the planting with smaller trees.

175
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:26,374
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've got, there's two colors in the code on the planting plan and

176
00:22:27,290 --> 00:22:32,912
[SPEAKER_03]: The pink ones are amelanchiers, which we, by graphic license, we added a little bit more pink.

177
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:36,134
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really pretty white, but we just thought it was a prettier plant.

178
00:22:36,174 --> 00:22:39,155
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but, you know, very, very small tree.

179
00:22:39,195 --> 00:22:43,617
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other would be a cherry, like a pin cherry or a choke cherry, a native cherry.

180
00:22:43,657 --> 00:22:46,238
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are smaller trees on purpose.

181
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:56,943
[SPEAKER_03]: But that being said, where the section line is drawn, if you zoom in on the plan, you can see that there's additional topography.

182
00:22:58,018 --> 00:23:07,022
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've consolidated the area and worked with the civil really closely to make sure that we had enough cover there.

183
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:11,725
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, there's some places there's as much as four feet over the top.

184
00:23:12,325 --> 00:23:23,170
[SPEAKER_03]: So as we do our CDs, we'll definitely be very careful to make sure that we have enough soil above the structures below.

185
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:26,812
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I appreciate that.

186
00:23:27,012 --> 00:23:27,452
[SPEAKER_05]: And you know,

187
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:37,459
[SPEAKER_05]: just throwing in the reminder that, you know, it's not just for, you know, if you need, if you have a four-foot root bottle planting, it's for when these things are grown in.

188
00:23:37,479 --> 00:23:39,821
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just concerned about the longevity of that system.

189
00:23:40,082 --> 00:23:43,885
[SPEAKER_05]: But no, I appreciate that that planting plan is not finalized yet.

190
00:23:44,906 --> 00:23:45,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

191
00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:48,409
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, additionally, you know, when

192
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:52,164
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a lot of work on this area, because it's a very sensitive thing.

193
00:23:52,224 --> 00:23:59,328
[SPEAKER_03]: And the last thing we want to do is to put plants that require too much moisture over the top of these systems.

194
00:23:59,868 --> 00:24:07,933
[SPEAKER_03]: So that while they're native, that doesn't mean that they're all the exact same plants across the board.

195
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:11,495
[SPEAKER_03]: So deeper into the swales will be an off of the

196
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:18,075
[SPEAKER_03]: the system, the drainage system below grade, there'll be a concentration of water.

197
00:24:18,095 --> 00:24:23,518
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the plant material above grade will reflect that, where we know the soils will be more wet.

198
00:24:24,078 --> 00:24:28,380
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a way to go yet on the planting plan, but it's all habitat.

199
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:31,241
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all native that we're showing within that gold area.

200
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,962
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

201
00:24:33,963 --> 00:24:38,725
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's a great segue to my second question, which is,

202
00:24:40,154 --> 00:24:48,117
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the requirements, and this is an engineering question, one of the requirements for the stormwater management standards is an offset from seasonal high water table.

203
00:24:49,977 --> 00:24:58,860
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't see any mention in your NOI of subsurface investigations or test pits done to identify that or to verify the assumption made for infiltration rate.

204
00:25:00,181 --> 00:25:03,682
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you able to speak to subsurface conditions on site?

205
00:25:07,017 --> 00:25:12,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, personally, I am not I'm sure our engineer Nate would be if he was here tonight.

206
00:25:12,981 --> 00:25:21,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't believe there's been, uh, any specific on site evaluations done, but I think it was.

207
00:25:22,530 --> 00:25:30,216
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe some of the analysis was based on soil maps and other data used to inform that report.

208
00:25:30,257 --> 00:25:35,401
[SPEAKER_02]: But I can pass that over to Nate for a more thorough response, certainly.

209
00:25:35,441 --> 00:25:43,508
[SPEAKER_02]: And Brian, I don't know if you're at all familiar with anything in regards to Craig's question that you could speak to.

210
00:25:43,868 --> 00:25:44,769
[SPEAKER_02]: If not, no worries.

211
00:25:46,744 --> 00:25:56,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I believe we were just relying on the USGS web soil data and some of the shoreline influence for the groundwater table.

212
00:25:56,886 --> 00:26:00,726
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm not aware of any on-site investigations that were taking place.

213
00:26:00,766 --> 00:26:02,907
[SPEAKER_06]: So happy to chat with Nate about that further.

214
00:26:02,927 --> 00:26:05,027
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

215
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:15,209
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think I'd like to see, you know, even if there are calculations that have been done to back out depth to a water table, I think that would be worthwhile to

216
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:21,292
[SPEAKER_05]: demonstrate compliance with that portion of the stormwater management standards.

217
00:26:24,813 --> 00:26:25,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Certainly.

218
00:26:26,354 --> 00:26:37,419
[SPEAKER_10]: And I concur with Greg's statement that there will need to be on-site data at some point.

219
00:26:37,459 --> 00:26:44,743
[SPEAKER_10]: We can talk about conditioning that, but it's a very difficult thing to condition in the event that you don't have the soil to support infiltration.

220
00:26:46,672 --> 00:26:46,892
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.

221
00:26:52,854 --> 00:26:54,234
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, yeah.

222
00:26:54,254 --> 00:26:55,675
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

223
00:26:56,195 --> 00:26:56,835
[SPEAKER_10]: No, you go ahead.

224
00:26:57,955 --> 00:27:01,676
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, I don't want to change, get off of, um, onsite.

225
00:27:01,736 --> 00:27:03,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Follow up with our engineer about that.

226
00:27:03,697 --> 00:27:13,840
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're, we're happy to, uh, um, do investigations if the commission determines that it's the appropriate thing to confirm the stormwater design.

227
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:15,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

228
00:27:16,015 --> 00:27:16,315
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.

229
00:27:16,876 --> 00:27:22,641
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, Craig, your turn.

230
00:27:23,662 --> 00:27:24,062
[SPEAKER_05]: No worries.

231
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:29,246
[SPEAKER_05]: I have one more comment on stormwater, and then I will cede the floor.

232
00:27:29,667 --> 00:27:41,677
[SPEAKER_05]: This is more of just a erosion sediment control plan comment, but in terms of showing construction phase E&S controls, we've

233
00:27:42,503 --> 00:27:48,125
[SPEAKER_05]: The plans submitted only show inlet protection on proposed catch basins.

234
00:27:48,165 --> 00:27:50,966
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't show any protection on existing catch basins.

235
00:27:52,687 --> 00:28:08,652
[SPEAKER_05]: I think NOI page 67, which has this plan, there are catch basins on site that would end up being below the footprint of the proposed building that would be impacted by any on-site demolition work, et cetera.

236
00:28:10,639 --> 00:28:17,404
[SPEAKER_05]: there should be notation in these plans indicating that existing capturations on site are subject to those E&S protections as well as any that are proposed.

237
00:28:19,266 --> 00:28:20,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's understood.

238
00:28:20,467 --> 00:28:22,388
[SPEAKER_02]: And certainly that's the intent.

239
00:28:22,508 --> 00:28:27,712
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll make sure that gets clarified and memorialized in the plans.

240
00:28:28,853 --> 00:28:29,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

241
00:28:29,694 --> 00:28:30,354
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very much.

242
00:28:30,695 --> 00:28:34,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I will cede the floor to Heidi.

243
00:28:35,959 --> 00:28:36,239
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

244
00:28:38,621 --> 00:28:54,841
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you please remind us of what, I know that there was catchment areas shown in the stormwater report, but can you remind us, please, of what will be contributing to these subsurface infiltration areas?

245
00:28:55,602 --> 00:28:55,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

246
00:28:58,872 --> 00:29:07,660
[SPEAKER_02]: More or less, you could imagine an east-west line through the building, and that's the delineation between the two different catchment areas.

247
00:29:09,441 --> 00:29:17,028
[SPEAKER_02]: That includes roof drains, so all of the building's roof will be routed to the infiltration system.

248
00:29:17,585 --> 00:29:26,308
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have the paved circulation areas outside of resource areas, but nonetheless involved included in the catchment areas.

249
00:29:26,768 --> 00:29:34,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Those paved areas for vehicular circulation will be routed through a water quality device before they reach the infiltration system.

250
00:29:35,591 --> 00:29:46,034
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also have area drains covering kind of along the Eastern edge of the building in the upper pathway to collect stormwater from that area.

251
00:29:48,939 --> 00:29:49,159
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

252
00:29:49,219 --> 00:29:49,419
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

253
00:29:49,459 --> 00:29:50,320
[SPEAKER_02]: That's useful.

254
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Through the infiltrating system.

255
00:29:51,681 --> 00:29:51,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

256
00:29:52,401 --> 00:29:52,621
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

257
00:29:52,701 --> 00:30:07,489
[SPEAKER_10]: We could, um, would appreciate more information on the subsurface on, I'm sorry, the pretreatment noting that the stormwater handle, um, uh, pretreatment is required unless the runoff is strictly from residential rooftops.

258
00:30:10,551 --> 00:30:13,632
[SPEAKER_10]: So it would be helpful to have that kind of detail.

259
00:30:14,593 --> 00:30:14,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

260
00:30:15,907 --> 00:30:20,790
[SPEAKER_10]: And also there should be access ports for these subsurface systems.

261
00:30:22,231 --> 00:30:25,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Are those, they're not shown on the plan, but I can see.

262
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:31,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the details on that, Brian.

263
00:30:31,097 --> 00:30:33,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that something you might be able to answer?

264
00:30:37,788 --> 00:30:45,015
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, these are shown on some of the details, um, it might not be shown on the, on the plans, uh, just at that scale.

265
00:30:45,615 --> 00:30:55,004
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, yeah, they, they are equipped with, um, we're looking at some of the call tech systems for the subsurface infiltration, um, system.

266
00:30:55,044 --> 00:30:58,447
[SPEAKER_06]: So, uh, these, I forget the, uh, you know,

267
00:30:59,590 --> 00:31:09,497
[SPEAKER_06]: square footage it's based on, but it should come with the equipped inspection ports per certain square foot for the area scaled up.

268
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:12,139
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

269
00:31:12,459 --> 00:31:12,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks.

270
00:31:18,483 --> 00:31:25,248
[SPEAKER_10]: And just to reiterate what Craig said, we do need to know what the ESHGW is for this.

271
00:31:25,328 --> 00:31:27,789
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, estimated seasonal high groundwater levels are.

272
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:33,622
[SPEAKER_10]: and site-specific soil information.

273
00:31:35,743 --> 00:31:43,246
[SPEAKER_10]: I have just another minor regulatory comment, but if anybody else has stormwater comments, we might as well stick to that for now.

274
00:31:49,288 --> 00:31:49,628
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

275
00:31:49,828 --> 00:31:52,549
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just barge ahead.

276
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:57,491
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a really picky thing, but your citation for

277
00:31:58,515 --> 00:32:03,617
[SPEAKER_10]: The exemption under Chapter 91 references the Chapter 91 regs.

278
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:14,860
[SPEAKER_10]: However, it should actually reference the Riverfront Area Regulations at 10.58, parentheses six, parentheses I. Apologies for that.

279
00:32:15,881 --> 00:32:19,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I intended to put in the one from the Wetlands Protection Act.

280
00:32:20,362 --> 00:32:24,204
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to amend and correct that citation.

281
00:32:24,444 --> 00:32:28,225
[SPEAKER_10]: It's totally picky, but because I have these tattoos on the inside of my arm,

282
00:32:28,577 --> 00:32:29,317
[SPEAKER_10]: I cannot.

283
00:32:29,838 --> 00:32:30,738
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, of course.

284
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:37,681
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I'm sorry.

285
00:32:37,961 --> 00:32:38,701
[SPEAKER_10]: One other question.

286
00:32:39,242 --> 00:32:50,687
[SPEAKER_10]: So the plan should also indicate if and where snow storage will be on the site, particularly from the circulation areas.

287
00:32:51,767 --> 00:32:57,150
[SPEAKER_10]: And of course, what we want to make sure is that it doesn't end up on top of the subsurface.

288
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:07,250
[SPEAKER_10]: or on top of the water quality devices, which would be more likely to happen.

289
00:33:11,873 --> 00:33:12,293
[SPEAKER_02]: Understood.

290
00:33:12,353 --> 00:33:12,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

291
00:33:12,814 --> 00:33:16,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we can work that into our drawings.

292
00:33:23,465 --> 00:33:27,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Heidi, I'll jump in with some landscape questions unless you have anything else.

293
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:29,087
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm set for the moment.

294
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:29,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

295
00:33:30,007 --> 00:33:30,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

296
00:33:30,267 --> 00:33:30,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

297
00:33:30,607 --> 00:33:34,468
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to start with the existing conditions plan.

298
00:33:34,668 --> 00:33:42,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I recall from our preview meeting several months ago, some discussion about existing trees and trying to have that surveyed.

299
00:33:43,111 --> 00:33:45,012
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand through reading the NOI that

300
00:33:46,700 --> 00:34:10,052
[SPEAKER_04]: The shoreline is predominantly invasive species, but I am curious to know if there are any non-invasive species or any significant existing trees within that riverfront area, particularly in the area most adjacent to the shoreline, where there may be some opportunity to preserve those trees.

301
00:34:12,026 --> 00:34:13,286
[SPEAKER_04]: with limited grading.

302
00:34:13,506 --> 00:34:15,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Has that been investigated at all?

303
00:34:16,267 --> 00:34:17,167
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been, yes.

304
00:34:17,287 --> 00:34:19,468
[SPEAKER_02]: I went out with a colleague.

305
00:34:19,508 --> 00:34:22,828
[SPEAKER_02]: We GPSed the trees within the limit of work.

306
00:34:23,048 --> 00:34:36,651
[SPEAKER_02]: There's approximately 15 within the work area of which 10 are native that will be removed and offset through planting of over 40 new trees within the riverfront area as part of the project.

307
00:34:39,475 --> 00:34:43,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, can you provide some detail on those existing trees?

308
00:34:43,298 --> 00:34:53,768
[SPEAKER_04]: I wasn't able to find that in the NOI, even a markup or a survey of where those exist and what the species are and if you have the size of them.

309
00:34:55,573 --> 00:35:05,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I have all that information, not right on hand, but I have the data layer of it and I can produce a map that depicts them.

310
00:35:06,058 --> 00:35:20,025
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know in terms of the invasive tree of heaven and black locust, and then I can't quite recall the native ones offhand, but there are varying maturities, varying levels of health.

311
00:35:20,665 --> 00:35:24,067
[SPEAKER_02]: Some are in good shape, some are quite mangled and partially dead.

312
00:35:25,288 --> 00:35:28,653
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do have all that information and I'm happy to package it up for you.

313
00:35:29,334 --> 00:35:29,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

314
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:29,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

315
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:34,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving to the.

316
00:35:36,165 --> 00:35:38,066
[SPEAKER_04]: to the site layout plan.

317
00:35:38,086 --> 00:35:48,449
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand the pathway that connects to the existing multi-use trail is intended to be 10 feet wide.

318
00:35:48,489 --> 00:35:51,751
[SPEAKER_04]: I assume that's a continuation of that multi-use trail.

319
00:35:53,011 --> 00:35:58,493
[SPEAKER_04]: It is quite a bit of impervious paving in the rubber front area, and I'm not

320
00:36:00,003 --> 00:36:17,402
[SPEAKER_04]: very familiar with the kind of like paving requirements for the pathways and DCR, but I'm curious if there are opportunities to introduce some permeable paving into that, into that paving surface, if you would consider that.

321
00:36:20,181 --> 00:36:22,923
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did notice there's a large piece of paving.

322
00:36:23,563 --> 00:36:27,245
[SPEAKER_04]: It's southeast corner of the building.

323
00:36:27,265 --> 00:36:32,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that tab at the end of that pathway along the 10-foot path?

324
00:36:33,449 --> 00:36:34,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, to the right there.

325
00:36:35,663 --> 00:36:37,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what is that intended for?

326
00:36:37,644 --> 00:36:39,986
[SPEAKER_04]: It seemed to kind of project out towards the shoreline.

327
00:36:40,426 --> 00:36:45,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's intended to be a seating area, essentially.

328
00:36:46,671 --> 00:36:54,716
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, a little space to step off the pathway and hang out along the shoreline and not obstruct people passing through.

329
00:36:56,237 --> 00:36:59,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that different than the other little bench seating areas?

330
00:37:00,233 --> 00:37:01,233
[SPEAKER_04]: shown to the north of that?

331
00:37:01,614 --> 00:37:16,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Natty, if I jump in here, what we had proposed was that they were interpretive stations, that there'd be some history of the site and something that describes what we're doing with Habitat, that sort of thing.

332
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:22,081
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've accommodated four interpretive educational stations there.

333
00:37:22,322 --> 00:37:25,843
[SPEAKER_03]: We took two and two each time.

334
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:29,408
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

335
00:37:30,509 --> 00:37:36,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I just wonder if those might be better located a little bit off of the shoreline, off of the riverfront there.

336
00:37:37,173 --> 00:37:50,302
[SPEAKER_04]: But it leads to another question, which Natty, you mentioned in the presentation you showed the zone of invasive plant removal and shoreline restoration.

337
00:37:52,414 --> 00:38:03,021
[SPEAKER_04]: as one of the mitigations, but it's not clear to me from the plans what's happening between what's proposed between the 10 foot pathway and that red outlined area.

338
00:38:03,041 --> 00:38:09,006
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some grading that happens in there, but there's no, not clear what the proposed planting is there.

339
00:38:09,026 --> 00:38:10,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you elaborate on that?

340
00:38:11,407 --> 00:38:13,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, so that's true.

341
00:38:13,328 --> 00:38:19,249
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the grading to match the pathway grade down to the existing grade in the area.

342
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:24,471
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't fully fleshed out the specific plantings in this area.

343
00:38:24,511 --> 00:38:31,533
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, at a minimum, we intend on some sort of conservation seed mix, but there's also a

344
00:38:32,813 --> 00:38:36,255
[SPEAKER_02]: likelihood that we incorporate some trees or other provisions there.

345
00:38:36,335 --> 00:38:52,424
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason it's not fully fleshed out currently is ultimately that this area is what we're coordinating with DCR and ultimately intend to grant an easement for them to take over maintenance of the area going forward.

346
00:38:52,804 --> 00:38:59,508
[SPEAKER_02]: The specific plantings in that zone are subject to those ongoing discussions, but it will be vegetated.

347
00:39:00,348 --> 00:39:00,969
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you that.

348
00:39:01,749 --> 00:39:02,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

349
00:39:02,269 --> 00:39:11,316
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll definitely want to see some information on that plan and what's proposed there considering its proximity to the waterway.

350
00:39:11,336 --> 00:39:24,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Then with that, JP, I'm wondering if you can just tell us a little bit about how the area for the wildlife and pollinator habitat was selected.

351
00:39:26,146 --> 00:39:27,767
[SPEAKER_04]: When I look at the plans, I'll say,

352
00:39:29,315 --> 00:39:31,296
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate the native tree planting.

353
00:39:31,316 --> 00:39:40,478
[SPEAKER_04]: It concerns me a little bit about the amount of lawn, non-native lawn that abuts the shoreline area.

354
00:39:40,498 --> 00:39:58,503
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm leading a bit here, but I wonder if there's a different condition along that 10-foot wide pathway that is not lawn that could offer mitigation in more of a,

355
00:40:00,756 --> 00:40:11,622
[SPEAKER_04]: more of a way of transitioning from the cultivated lawn down to the riparian edge, rather than this pocket of wildlife and pollinator habitat off to the side.

356
00:40:14,243 --> 00:40:15,984
[SPEAKER_04]: That's part statement and question.

357
00:40:17,005 --> 00:40:17,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

358
00:40:17,966 --> 00:40:18,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

359
00:40:20,667 --> 00:40:28,311
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we could definitely reduce the amount of lawn and bring in more native plant material in there.

360
00:40:28,972 --> 00:40:29,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

361
00:40:32,243 --> 00:40:37,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, if I went through the concept of there's.

362
00:40:38,468 --> 00:40:59,686
[SPEAKER_03]: Contextually, a whole lot of things going on, and part of this is being part of the system that goes to the north and south and we've, we've used river's edge as a model to some degree here, because the residential component to create some kind of area that's recreational, that's not as natural.

363
00:41:00,799 --> 00:41:02,581
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is a part of it.

364
00:41:02,621 --> 00:41:23,758
[SPEAKER_03]: And it could be, like, for example, that we, on the right side, on the riverside between the path and the stone wall that would be in place there, we could do above that, we could do a lot more naturalistic native planting.

365
00:41:25,523 --> 00:41:33,170
[SPEAKER_03]: And that way, people could have a little bit of a chance for some kind of recreational stuff down below there between the path.

366
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:37,534
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a seat wall, actually, that entire length.

367
00:41:37,574 --> 00:41:46,343
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a definition of a space and the framing of a space that's happening with that wall that's engaged with the building.

368
00:41:46,363 --> 00:41:49,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's such a narrow corridor now.

369
00:41:50,976 --> 00:42:01,864
[SPEAKER_03]: that where you've got the area between where the upper path is about eight feet of grade change at the most extreme.

370
00:42:01,924 --> 00:42:03,586
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what all those stairs are about.

371
00:42:04,366 --> 00:42:11,352
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like trying to create a space that's usable and identifiable as a node kind of thing.

372
00:42:14,494 --> 00:42:18,497
[SPEAKER_04]: We can definitely bridge.

373
00:42:18,718 --> 00:42:25,043
[SPEAKER_04]: I see it as a threshold between the building zone and the natural habitat there.

374
00:42:26,684 --> 00:42:32,729
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where personally I would prioritize putting that native habitat area.

375
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:35,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for considering that.

376
00:42:37,573 --> 00:42:41,076
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed that switching to the grading plan here,

377
00:42:42,732 --> 00:42:53,996
[SPEAKER_04]: Retaining wall on the pathway where it meets the edge of the work area on the south is quite a bit into the three to one slope.

378
00:42:54,156 --> 00:43:02,739
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand this as being coordinated with DCR, but it results in a five foot tall retaining wall at that point.

379
00:43:05,803 --> 00:43:08,904
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I'm flagging that down here at the south end.

380
00:43:09,084 --> 00:43:22,588
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like some adjustments to the alignment there may be needed to really keep that out of the steeper part of the slope and hopefully avoid such a significant retaining wall that close to the shoreline.

381
00:43:22,608 --> 00:43:28,090
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.

382
00:43:32,968 --> 00:43:37,752
[SPEAKER_02]: You're referring to the southern pathway connection to the off-site area, right?

383
00:43:38,333 --> 00:43:38,673
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.

384
00:43:39,253 --> 00:43:39,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.

385
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:40,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

386
00:43:40,554 --> 00:43:51,704
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little harder to see in this plan, but in the grading plan, you can see where the 10-foot pathway is well within the steeper part of the bank there.

387
00:43:53,169 --> 00:44:01,552
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't quite look like it aligns with the parking lot, and it may not be intended to align with the parking lot or a connection to the parking lot.

388
00:44:02,232 --> 00:44:13,116
[SPEAKER_04]: But from what I can tell in the Google Earth images, at least the existing condition is that that bike path does connect to the parking lot as it is now.

389
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:21,970
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I will say there's a quite extreme grade change in that area, um, out on site.

390
00:44:22,010 --> 00:44:25,112
[SPEAKER_02]: It's quite abrupt right along that Southern area.

391
00:44:25,272 --> 00:44:34,898
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that design is really driven by that pretty stark change between the MBTA parking lot and the shoreline walkway area.

392
00:44:34,918 --> 00:44:37,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

393
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:38,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

394
00:44:40,777 --> 00:44:51,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you can go ahead, but I did have a response to an earlier question from the commission regarding the depth to groundwater.

395
00:44:52,681 --> 00:45:07,546
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been informed that there were prior borings on the site before I was involved in the project, but they encountered groundwater about six to seven and a half feet below the existing grade, which is, of course,

396
00:45:09,386 --> 00:45:17,009
[SPEAKER_02]: given the grade changes in the project, a little bit further depth under the proposed condition than the existing.

397
00:45:17,529 --> 00:45:21,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to give an initial response to that comment from the commission.

398
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:24,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

399
00:45:29,412 --> 00:45:30,953
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry for cutting you off, Jeremy.

400
00:45:30,993 --> 00:45:31,554
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.

401
00:45:32,414 --> 00:45:32,895
[SPEAKER_04]: It's okay.

402
00:45:32,915 --> 00:45:34,896
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm on my last comment here.

403
00:45:35,597 --> 00:45:41,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for explaining that the pink tree symbols are the Amelanchier.

404
00:45:42,442 --> 00:45:51,549
[SPEAKER_04]: I just would ask that the landscape plan have a schedule associated with it so that we can identify the rest of the proposed trees.

405
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:58,035
[SPEAKER_04]: I did see in the NOI the list and all of those looked good, but I would like to understand what's being planted.

406
00:45:58,855 --> 00:46:02,236
[SPEAKER_04]: within the riverfront zones and the buffer zone.

407
00:46:06,237 --> 00:46:06,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Jerry.

408
00:46:06,737 --> 00:46:07,117
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all good.

409
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:07,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

410
00:46:09,538 --> 00:46:09,858
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.

411
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:15,380
[SPEAKER_10]: Caroline, before I say anything else, you haven't spoken yet.

412
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have any comments?

413
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,721
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just a couple of questions.

414
00:46:19,741 --> 00:46:24,582
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can talk about the DCR footpath for a minute.

415
00:46:25,052 --> 00:46:32,975
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a reason why that that footpath can't be tied into the path closer to the building?

416
00:46:32,995 --> 00:46:38,377
[SPEAKER_02]: The shoreline 10 foot wide walkway you meant?

417
00:46:38,397 --> 00:46:38,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

418
00:46:46,228 --> 00:46:58,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think the design is really driven by the footprint of a previously granted easement that we are attempting to map.

419
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:05,264
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's a long story, but there is an easement attempted to be granted in the past that was never finalized.

420
00:47:05,425 --> 00:47:10,509
[SPEAKER_02]: And we kind of, that was the area intended to be the DCR shoreline walkway area.

421
00:47:10,549 --> 00:47:11,109
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've kind of,

422
00:47:12,126 --> 00:47:14,707
[SPEAKER_02]: matched our proposed design with that easement.

423
00:47:14,787 --> 00:47:33,631
[SPEAKER_02]: It has been shifted a bit further landward from the previous pathway proposal on the site, but I think that's really why you're seeing that kind of in its present location, particularly because to the south of the site, the connection is constrained by the MBTA parking lot.

424
00:47:34,631 --> 00:47:41,033
[SPEAKER_02]: It really can't move any further west than where it's shown now, because there's the parking lot

425
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:45,494
[SPEAKER_02]: stormwater basin in that area.

426
00:47:45,915 --> 00:47:52,417
[SPEAKER_02]: So I know at least in the southern portion of the site, that was the intent to be able to seamlessly make that connection.

427
00:47:53,377 --> 00:47:53,778
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

428
00:47:53,938 --> 00:48:00,200
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I get so in the southern portion of the site, you have two paths leading towards the exit from the project site.

429
00:48:01,321 --> 00:48:07,383
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems redundant to have two paths that are going the same place.

430
00:48:08,157 --> 00:48:13,401
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would prefer to see less pavement within the 100 foot riverfront area.

431
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,943
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.

432
00:48:16,003 --> 00:48:18,245
[SPEAKER_00]: I know logistics of an easement are separate.

433
00:48:18,285 --> 00:48:22,068
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure what the, is it the owners granting the easement?

434
00:48:23,029 --> 00:48:28,353
[SPEAKER_00]: But if there is flexibility on that, I don't see why

435
00:48:30,842 --> 00:48:41,428
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those paths couldn't do double duty, and I would prefer the path that's farther out from the river be used as that 10-foot wide path.

436
00:48:42,669 --> 00:48:48,792
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you probably don't have that answer now, but if it could be looked at and maybe a response, that would be great.

437
00:48:48,812 --> 00:48:49,773
[SPEAKER_00]: I would appreciate that.

438
00:48:51,033 --> 00:48:55,756
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other item on the footpath

439
00:48:56,803 --> 00:49:04,576
[SPEAKER_00]: In the notice of intent, the applicant is claiming exemption as a limited project.

440
00:49:05,458 --> 00:49:07,481
[SPEAKER_00]: I do just note that

441
00:49:08,292 --> 00:49:11,613
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not something that you automatically qualify for.

442
00:49:11,653 --> 00:49:13,854
[SPEAKER_00]: It is up to the commission's discretion.

443
00:49:14,655 --> 00:49:21,658
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to discuss with the commission members whether we want to grant limited project status to that footpath.

444
00:49:22,438 --> 00:49:26,340
[SPEAKER_00]: Just given the extent of the project, I'm

445
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:37,664
[SPEAKER_00]: inclined not to and would like to see the full riverfront area performance standards met, but that will be a discussion item for us commissioners.

446
00:49:38,404 --> 00:49:43,126
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that you're asking us to grant you limited project status for that.

447
00:49:43,726 --> 00:49:52,810
[SPEAKER_00]: I would too if I were you, but just something for the commissioners I think to discuss another time or tonight, whenever.

448
00:49:54,550 --> 00:50:01,155
[SPEAKER_00]: And final comment, I don't know if you've given any thought, two comments, sorry.

449
00:50:01,275 --> 00:50:08,099
[SPEAKER_00]: Could I, could you submit the chapter 91 administrative approval to us just to see it?

450
00:50:11,061 --> 00:50:11,461
[SPEAKER_00]: And then,

451
00:50:13,332 --> 00:50:14,693
[SPEAKER_00]: another comment.

452
00:50:14,713 --> 00:50:18,015
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to a Woburn Conservation Commissioner.

453
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:22,879
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any plan for pest management surrounding this?

454
00:50:22,979 --> 00:50:31,324
[SPEAKER_00]: I know rodenticides are a big topic right now, and I'd be interested to know if there's any plan for pest management.

455
00:50:31,424 --> 00:50:36,688
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I take the MBTA from Wellington five days a week, so I know there are

456
00:50:37,267 --> 00:50:44,474
[SPEAKER_00]: pests in the area, and certainly the commission would be sensitive to any rodenticide use within the riverfront area.

457
00:50:45,595 --> 00:50:54,584
[SPEAKER_00]: So if that hasn't been given any thought, I'd appreciate some feedback or what the plan would be on that front.

458
00:50:55,124 --> 00:50:59,028
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will pause there and let Heidi take over.

459
00:51:00,663 --> 00:51:04,144
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, perhaps a moment to respond to a few of those comments.

460
00:51:05,325 --> 00:51:09,166
[SPEAKER_02]: JP, did you want to speak a little bit to the design intent of the?

461
00:51:10,507 --> 00:51:11,187
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

462
00:51:11,247 --> 00:51:13,708
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason, a couple of reasons that there's two paths.

463
00:51:14,488 --> 00:51:22,871
[SPEAKER_03]: One is that for ADA compliance, there's just a huge grade change between where the building is and where the

464
00:51:24,739 --> 00:51:26,680
[SPEAKER_03]: the wider 10-foot wide path is.

465
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:29,782
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's literally eight or nine feet.

466
00:51:30,322 --> 00:51:33,023
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've got a lot to take up there.

467
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:46,750
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the south end of the plan, literally all the way to the southeast corner of the building, you're just under maximum slopes to conform with an ADA-compliant slope, unless you're going to do some sort of switchback.

468
00:51:49,011 --> 00:51:51,832
[SPEAKER_03]: So the other thing is, the building's big.

469
00:51:51,972 --> 00:51:53,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, let's just be

470
00:51:53,886 --> 00:51:54,306
[SPEAKER_03]: honest.

471
00:51:54,947 --> 00:52:01,633
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that allowing the public to be a little further away from the footprint of the building would be nicer.

472
00:52:02,734 --> 00:52:21,210
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, you know, it's the cross section that we drew is illustrative of a particular series of issues, but it makes it feel very large, the volume of the area, whereas when you get into it, so if we look at this for a second, and I'm Maddie, go back to the plan, please.

473
00:52:22,425 --> 00:52:25,668
[SPEAKER_03]: you look at that diagonally, can you see where the section line is, AA?

474
00:52:27,029 --> 00:52:31,834
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanted to go through a series of issues that were related to water quality measures.

475
00:52:32,334 --> 00:52:41,663
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that section is about three or four times as wide in terms of the part that looks like it's parkland.

476
00:52:42,404 --> 00:52:43,845
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get to the pinch point,

477
00:52:44,568 --> 00:52:49,952
[SPEAKER_03]: It's much smaller, like 70 feet, something like that, 60, 70 feet.

478
00:52:50,032 --> 00:52:57,658
[SPEAKER_03]: When you have a building this large, I thought it'd be helpful as a member of the public to be just a little bit further off.

479
00:52:58,298 --> 00:53:06,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I also feel like it's a real squeeze between, I mean, part of what Mattie said was absolutely right, that there's an original easement that

480
00:53:07,846 --> 00:53:15,230
[SPEAKER_03]: basically had this alignment, and we just refined it because that's a way that we know with DCR that we're going to be able to get a park built.

481
00:53:16,831 --> 00:53:22,274
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel like we can look at making it softer.

482
00:53:22,634 --> 00:53:26,015
[SPEAKER_03]: We can look at moving it over 5 or 10 feet closer to the building.

483
00:53:26,055 --> 00:53:30,778
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a quality of separation between the private

484
00:53:31,588 --> 00:53:41,998
[SPEAKER_03]: element of the building and then the public element of the park, and it's really so compressed here that I was trying to create a little bit of separation for folks in both cases.

485
00:53:46,062 --> 00:53:46,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, thanks.

486
00:53:47,463 --> 00:53:48,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, JP.

487
00:53:48,284 --> 00:53:57,172
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Jack or Eric, I didn't know if you wanted just a quick word regarding the discussions with DCR and the future easement.

488
00:53:59,011 --> 00:54:11,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so the DCR is looking for an easement from us to complete this path and they've had earmarked funds come and go and I don't know if they're still around to actually do some of the work on the path, but there's a

489
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:16,301
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they have gone through quite a process for that location.

490
00:54:16,341 --> 00:54:24,484
[SPEAKER_01]: We did move it westward a bit just to kind of move outside some of the encroachments that they had originally.

491
00:54:24,684 --> 00:54:28,485
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in our discussions with them, they're excited about it.

492
00:54:28,566 --> 00:54:29,186
[SPEAKER_01]: They like it.

493
00:54:29,246 --> 00:54:30,766
[SPEAKER_01]: They think it works well.

494
00:54:31,266 --> 00:54:38,609
[SPEAKER_01]: They like what we're doing in terms of that pavilion, providing some shelter for bikers and whatever pedestrians as well.

495
00:54:39,292 --> 00:54:47,178
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've tried to work with them to come up with a plan that kind of fits what they had in mind and what we're doing, but we never did.

496
00:54:48,027 --> 00:54:52,509
[SPEAKER_01]: talk too much like JP was mentioning about moving it close to the building.

497
00:54:52,529 --> 00:54:55,391
[SPEAKER_01]: There's probably a lot of reasons.

498
00:54:55,411 --> 00:54:58,552
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand the reason having one path would be good.

499
00:54:58,732 --> 00:55:15,821
[SPEAKER_01]: And initially I thought that would be the way to go, but then given all the topo that we came to understand, it just seemed like, you know, I'll defer to JP as I always do, but it seemed like this was the path, the location that made the most sense, so.

500
00:55:16,953 --> 00:55:30,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps DCR could weigh in on that again, but we've kind of tried to accommodate everything that they were trying to do originally and still intend, by the way, to receive those dollars to help with some of the improvements.

501
00:55:30,983 --> 00:55:40,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the fact that we're here and helping out allows them to use some of those dollars to complete the path across the MBTA land as well.

502
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:44,553
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, working together with them, the goal is to get this path

503
00:55:45,333 --> 00:55:47,574
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can connect and, uh, anyway.

504
00:55:48,275 --> 00:55:51,196
[SPEAKER_01]: Just just a little background and my discussions with them.

505
00:55:52,677 --> 00:55:53,498
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Angela.

506
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:58,660
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for your comment, Caroline.

507
00:55:59,841 --> 00:56:10,587
[SPEAKER_10]: Along those lines, I would ask if there's any opportunities to reduce the amount of impervious pavement currently proposed.

508
00:56:13,589 --> 00:56:16,972
[SPEAKER_10]: can the path be reduced from 10 feet to 8 feet possibly?

509
00:56:17,052 --> 00:56:30,185
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what DCR's standards are generally, but DOT in some circumstances in wetlands or near other resource areas have reduced to 8 feet wide.

510
00:56:31,747 --> 00:56:36,932
[SPEAKER_10]: They would prefer wider, but if you could respond to that

511
00:56:38,837 --> 00:56:41,519
[SPEAKER_10]: a possibility of reduction there.

512
00:56:42,419 --> 00:56:47,862
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, I'm looking at the pavilion seating area.

513
00:56:48,222 --> 00:57:01,090
[SPEAKER_10]: I wonder if there's any opportunities to reduce impervious pavement in that area or to have any pervious pavement, as Jeremy mentioned earlier, in that facility.

514
00:57:02,531 --> 00:57:06,373
[SPEAKER_10]: I would ask you to take a look at just opportunities to reduce impervious area.

515
00:57:10,508 --> 00:57:10,708
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

516
00:57:10,788 --> 00:57:11,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for those comments.

517
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:13,129
[SPEAKER_02]: We can take a look at that.

518
00:57:13,149 --> 00:57:14,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.

519
00:57:14,809 --> 00:57:15,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

520
00:57:23,132 --> 00:57:25,433
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody else from the commission have anything further?

521
00:57:28,114 --> 00:57:30,935
[SPEAKER_08]: I have one question about invasive species.

522
00:57:32,587 --> 00:57:42,293
[SPEAKER_08]: If we can jump to that, it just said in the narrative section of your notice of intent, you mentioned invasives will be monitored on an ongoing basis.

523
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:49,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you just provide a bit more color on that and maybe

524
00:57:51,323 --> 00:57:56,424
[SPEAKER_08]: some of that color could be put into the actual monitoring plan that you included as an appendix.

525
00:57:57,364 --> 00:58:04,985
[SPEAKER_08]: I do applaud the team's effort on invasives and in particular an issue close to my heart, the removal of marine debris.

526
00:58:05,005 --> 00:58:05,966
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for that.

527
00:58:06,866 --> 00:58:18,348
[SPEAKER_08]: I guess part of what I'm getting at is if there's going to be some ongoing monitoring of the invasive species, would you guys be willing to consider a more systematic

528
00:58:20,762 --> 00:58:24,503
[SPEAKER_08]: debris removal program, you know, in conjunction with that monitoring.

529
00:58:27,517 --> 00:58:28,037
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, yeah.

530
00:58:28,097 --> 00:58:36,519
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, in terms of the monitoring frequency, I think we all know sometimes it's tough to eradicate these invasives.

531
00:58:36,659 --> 00:58:40,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you don't get them all in the first go around.

532
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:57,283
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there's absolutely an intent on an annual basis to review the shoreline area, survey it, see if the eradication has been successful or if more work needs to be done.

533
00:58:58,464 --> 00:59:11,280
[SPEAKER_02]: So to that end, I think on an annual basis, taking a look at that and as necessary going back in and doing further removal is something that we anticipate doing as needed.

534
00:59:12,748 --> 00:59:14,229
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would appreciate that.

535
00:59:14,289 --> 00:59:25,834
[SPEAKER_08]: And maybe I suggest or the other commissioners could weigh in, at least in the monitoring plan, a commitment of that monitoring for three years, three growing seasons, however you want to term it.

536
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:27,234
[SPEAKER_08]: That seems reasonable to me.

537
00:59:27,254 --> 00:59:29,275
[SPEAKER_08]: And then as needed on an ongoing basis.

538
00:59:31,396 --> 00:59:35,378
[SPEAKER_08]: And then as for the debris removal, I'm sure your intent is to

539
00:59:36,163 --> 00:59:36,823
[SPEAKER_08]: keep your site clean.

540
00:59:36,863 --> 00:59:40,084
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody likes a clean site, right?

541
00:59:40,565 --> 00:59:50,788
[SPEAKER_08]: The tougher stuff to get at that your sort of day-to-day maintenance crew might not pick up, I guess, is what I'm trying to get at with the bigger debris that might wash up on the shoreline.

542
00:59:50,848 --> 01:00:00,892
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you would consider something in there about pulling out the sort of bigger stuff on a somewhat regular basis, I would appreciate that, or at least your consideration of that.

543
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:04,511
[SPEAKER_01]: I can answer that a little bit.

544
01:00:04,531 --> 01:00:06,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, we will consider it.

545
01:00:06,473 --> 01:00:10,376
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is our front door, even though it's public and private, right?

546
01:00:10,416 --> 01:00:16,280
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to do everything in our power to make that as inviting as possible.

547
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:20,624
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you, walking down there now, there's a lot of work to do, certainly.

548
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:31,732
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're thinking that once the project is in place and all of these improvements, it'll be less of an area for people to kind of hide away and store different debris.

549
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:37,167
[SPEAKER_01]: open for visibility to the public and the residents as well.

550
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:53,977
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have no issue trying to put in place some sort of a program where we sort of sweep that on a, you know, by every other month or whatever the appropriate amount of time is because it's in our interest as well as the interest of the public.

551
01:00:53,997 --> 01:00:55,258
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah, I appreciate that.

552
01:00:55,338 --> 01:00:56,099
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate that.

553
01:00:56,139 --> 01:00:56,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.

554
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:00,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to thank you.

555
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:01,707
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

556
01:01:02,528 --> 01:01:03,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks for bringing up the indice.

557
01:01:03,751 --> 01:01:05,975
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot I had some comments there.

558
01:01:12,108 --> 01:01:17,573
[SPEAKER_04]: I was surprised to see that black swallow wart had not been identified out there.

559
01:01:18,013 --> 01:01:25,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I would ask that that be, even if it's not there now, that it be included in the monitoring plan as so much disturbance will happen out here.

560
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:31,505
[SPEAKER_04]: It's becoming a real problem in Medford and many places around us.

561
01:01:34,229 --> 01:01:39,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been reading a lot lately about Tree of Heaven, Ailanthus removal.

562
01:01:39,472 --> 01:01:48,378
[SPEAKER_04]: And the plan, as it's described right now, says that the mature trees will be cut and the stumps treated.

563
01:01:48,458 --> 01:01:55,823
[SPEAKER_04]: What I have read, and I'm curious how this factors into your plans, is that cutting those trees

564
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:09,737
[SPEAKER_04]: encourages the roots to sucker, and what is one tree will turn into 50 small trees, and that can be managed through a, through, you know, three years of

565
01:02:10,963 --> 01:02:13,124
[SPEAKER_04]: of monitoring and then more as needed.

566
01:02:13,344 --> 01:02:21,446
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have read that a hack and spray treatment before removing the tree is effective at killing the roots as well.

567
01:02:21,826 --> 01:02:25,087
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it asks that you investigate some of that.

568
01:02:26,447 --> 01:02:36,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Similarly, the proposed method of treating the knotweed in the report describes through primarily mechanical methods.

569
01:02:38,761 --> 01:02:51,369
[SPEAKER_04]: There again, I've learned that trying to just manage through mechanical removal often encourages the roots to send up even more shoots and more sprouts.

570
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:57,613
[SPEAKER_04]: So that may want to be more of a mechanical and chemical treatment method.

571
01:02:59,558 --> 01:03:18,305
[SPEAKER_04]: And then last here is maybe a question for you guys as much as my fellow commissioners, but the plan describes leaving the phragmites or common reed within the two smaller BVW areas and just limiting the treatment to the area around it.

572
01:03:20,025 --> 01:03:27,790
[SPEAKER_04]: That to me suggests that within a few years, we'll just have a population of phragmites taking over again.

573
01:03:27,810 --> 01:03:41,739
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm curious to hear opinions on whether actually treating within those PVW areas as a part of this plan could be considered, considering the size of them relative to the shoreline.

574
01:03:42,659 --> 01:03:50,689
[SPEAKER_04]: rather than leaving them alone, would we be okay with extending the removal of phragmites into those areas as well?

575
01:04:00,648 --> 01:04:02,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm happy to respond to that.

576
01:04:02,550 --> 01:04:17,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, the intent was to avoid impacts to that area, but I think we're happy to hear the commission's feedback on that topic if they think it's an appropriate intervention for the area.

577
01:04:17,101 --> 01:04:26,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think it would be appropriate mitigation for riverfront area alterations?

578
01:04:31,022 --> 01:04:40,708
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, echoing what others have said, I greatly appreciate the amount of effort that's been put into the invasive species management plan.

579
01:04:41,869 --> 01:04:48,653
[SPEAKER_10]: And I hope that, you know, with our comments, we can have a more robust plan.

580
01:04:53,456 --> 01:04:53,876
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

581
01:04:55,017 --> 01:04:58,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, let me be clear, despite my very nitpicky comments.

582
01:04:59,775 --> 01:05:00,956
[SPEAKER_04]: I do appreciate it as well.

583
01:05:01,197 --> 01:05:08,284
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm getting into the details because we don't often see these level of details in invasive species management plans.

584
01:05:08,924 --> 01:05:09,985
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was very much appreciated.

585
01:05:10,005 --> 01:05:15,952
[SPEAKER_04]: You have said, Jeremy, getting into the weeds with... That's exactly right.

586
01:05:17,153 --> 01:05:21,898
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I really appreciate your comments on methods of control, particularly given tree of heaven.

587
01:05:22,742 --> 01:05:30,284
[SPEAKER_10]: Now we don't think that including those in a revised invasive species management plan would be appropriate.

588
01:05:30,324 --> 01:05:35,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Heidi, I just have one question, if I may.

589
01:05:37,705 --> 01:05:42,966
[SPEAKER_00]: When does the applicant anticipate submitting a full planting plan?

590
01:05:48,007 --> 01:05:49,808
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack and Eric, can you hear me?

591
01:05:55,134 --> 01:05:59,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, we will submit it whenever you feel that's appropriate.

592
01:05:59,535 --> 01:06:05,917
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think JP, we aren't too far away from having a full planting plan on this project.

593
01:06:05,937 --> 01:06:08,898
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it could be submitted obviously prior to

594
01:06:12,271 --> 01:06:14,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, what are the next steps here?

595
01:06:14,592 --> 01:06:24,354
[SPEAKER_01]: I would anticipate we could submit it and I don't want to put words in your mouth, JP, but what kind of timeframe do you think you need to submit a planting plan for this project?

596
01:06:31,115 --> 01:06:32,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's two of us working on it.

597
01:06:34,454 --> 01:06:45,558
[SPEAKER_03]: different areas of the site, so maybe it's worth pointing as well on the eastern side of the path, of the DCR path.

598
01:06:46,618 --> 01:06:49,439
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, for our part, I think a couple of weeks.

599
01:06:53,181 --> 01:06:53,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

600
01:06:53,801 --> 01:06:56,322
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not holding you to anything more scheduling-wise.

601
01:06:56,382 --> 01:06:59,323
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just wondering when we might be able to see it and then review it.

602
01:07:08,275 --> 01:07:08,875
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, great.

603
01:07:09,015 --> 01:07:18,978
[SPEAKER_10]: Before we continue with any discussion, I need to ask if there's any members of the public here that would like to comment or ask a question.

604
01:07:24,219 --> 01:07:28,620
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, hearing none, I'll bring it back to the commission.

605
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:34,842
[SPEAKER_10]: It seems like we have a number of comments, and so we don't appear to be ready to issue an order this evening.

606
01:07:37,326 --> 01:07:42,869
[SPEAKER_10]: So, we've done actually turn it back to the project team and.

607
01:07:45,751 --> 01:07:49,013
[SPEAKER_10]: Would ask if you're a medical to continue in this year.

608
01:07:51,715 --> 01:07:52,855
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

609
01:07:58,387 --> 01:08:00,128
[SPEAKER_01]: We're happy to continue the hearing.

610
01:08:00,329 --> 01:08:16,002
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in a little bit of a precarious situation with where we stand on keeping this project alive and not trying to say it's urgent, but it's probably more urgent than a typical situation.

611
01:08:16,082 --> 01:08:23,268
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would ask that our team could get back to you as quickly as possible with the information you've asked for tonight, assuming that we

612
01:08:24,492 --> 01:08:27,194
[SPEAKER_01]: And we haven't been able to answer all the questions, certainly.

613
01:08:27,274 --> 01:08:34,298
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as we can get that submitted, we would very much appreciate being back in front of the commission.

614
01:08:42,558 --> 01:08:43,859
[SPEAKER_01]: for a lot of different reasons.

615
01:08:44,299 --> 01:08:57,691
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that we're here a couple of years after we started this, not with the Conservation Commission, but just where we are in this project, given how much time we've had on it, speaks to the kind of urgency that we're in.

616
01:08:57,791 --> 01:09:08,020
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, to the extent our team can solve this quickly and get it back to you, we would very much appreciate being back in front of you as quickly as possible.

617
01:09:10,835 --> 01:09:11,235
[SPEAKER_10]: Understood.

618
01:09:11,255 --> 01:09:12,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Understood.

619
01:09:14,677 --> 01:09:19,739
[SPEAKER_10]: I would suggest that you continue to work on getting your file number as quickly as possible.

620
01:09:24,721 --> 01:09:25,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, understood.

621
01:09:25,721 --> 01:09:31,884
[SPEAKER_02]: We will reach out to Nero about that issue and sort that out as soon as possible.

622
01:09:32,664 --> 01:09:32,904
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

623
01:09:34,085 --> 01:09:39,047
[SPEAKER_10]: And also, as I'm sure you're aware that MBTA sent a letter

624
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:41,992
[SPEAKER_10]: to the design team today.

625
01:09:42,012 --> 01:09:44,014
[SPEAKER_10]: No, yesterday, sorry.

626
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:55,023
[SPEAKER_10]: And so their concerns are not directly related to the Wetlands Protection Act, necessarily.

627
01:09:55,063 --> 01:09:55,944
[SPEAKER_10]: They are in a butter.

628
01:09:56,845 --> 01:10:04,512
[SPEAKER_10]: And it is, of course, in your best interest to coordinate with them as soon as possible.

629
01:10:06,634 --> 01:10:16,459
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, yes, we got a copy of the letter today and we're happy to have continued conversations with the T about their comments.

630
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:27,545
[SPEAKER_10]: Great, thank you.

631
01:10:27,565 --> 01:10:29,266
[SPEAKER_10]: Do I have a motion from the commission?

632
01:10:31,855 --> 01:10:35,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I'll make a motion to continue this hearing.

633
01:10:37,497 --> 01:10:43,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we say to our next regularly scheduled meeting, is that feasible for Nati, for your team?

634
01:10:44,941 --> 01:10:51,683
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we would need more than 48 hours to review material, ideally.

635
01:10:51,703 --> 01:10:53,364
[SPEAKER_08]: The sooner the better.

636
01:10:53,464 --> 01:10:59,867
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know if we need to state that in a motion, but if not, I would just make a motion to continue this hearing.

637
01:11:02,885 --> 01:11:03,405
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll second that.

638
01:11:05,266 --> 01:11:06,486
[SPEAKER_10]: All in favor, Craig?

639
01:11:07,726 --> 01:11:07,846
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

640
01:11:08,707 --> 01:11:08,887
[SPEAKER_10]: Eric?

641
01:11:10,107 --> 01:11:10,227
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

642
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:11,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Jeremy?

643
01:11:12,348 --> 01:11:14,068
[SPEAKER_10]: Aye.

644
01:11:14,108 --> 01:11:14,568
[SPEAKER_10]: Caroline?

645
01:11:15,489 --> 01:11:15,609
[SPEAKER_00]: Aye.

646
01:11:16,609 --> 01:11:20,050
[SPEAKER_10]: And myself is an aye.

647
01:11:20,090 --> 01:11:20,750
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

648
01:11:20,770 --> 01:11:24,351
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we reschedule to continue the hearing till?

649
01:11:27,292 --> 01:11:28,793
[SPEAKER_08]: Understanding the proponents

650
01:11:31,176 --> 01:11:32,277
[SPEAKER_08]: reasonable urgency here.

651
01:11:32,317 --> 01:11:36,761
[SPEAKER_08]: I think if we could have a couple of days to review what we've asked for that, that works for me.

652
01:11:36,801 --> 01:11:37,122
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

653
01:11:37,222 --> 01:11:41,105
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't want to put other commissioners in the hot seat, but that seems reasonable.

654
01:11:43,187 --> 01:11:44,168
[SPEAKER_08]: That's about the 23rd.

655
01:11:47,851 --> 01:11:48,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Dennis, does that work for you?

656
01:11:48,992 --> 01:11:55,018
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure Dennis can hear us.

657
01:11:56,156 --> 01:11:56,656
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I can't.

658
01:11:56,956 --> 01:11:58,057
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I was sort of waiting.

659
01:11:58,097 --> 01:12:00,819
[SPEAKER_07]: I was over here asking you or asking the applicant.

660
01:12:00,859 --> 01:12:02,279
[SPEAKER_07]: So 23rd is fine.

661
01:12:02,419 --> 01:12:08,583
[SPEAKER_07]: That would just mean we'd have to get stuff in hand by really Monday the 21st then.

662
01:12:12,225 --> 01:12:15,627
[SPEAKER_07]: Friday is even better, but... Yeah, sorry, but yeah.

663
01:12:15,687 --> 01:12:17,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you said 48, so I kind of just went back that way, but yeah.

664
01:12:19,288 --> 01:12:21,770
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, it would have to be, like, 9 a.m.

665
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:22,630
[SPEAKER_07]: on Monday.

666
01:12:23,131 --> 01:12:24,091
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what I mean?

667
01:12:24,111 --> 01:12:27,454
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, not until, like, you know, you can't wait until, like, 5.30, 6 o'clock.

668
01:12:27,494 --> 01:12:32,477
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you have anything that comes in in the interim, if you have stuff, just get it to us as soon as you get it.

669
01:12:33,197 --> 01:12:35,039
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't need everything all at once at the end.

670
01:12:35,099 --> 01:12:38,401
[SPEAKER_07]: So, the minute you get something, just forward it to us, and I'll forward it off.

671
01:12:41,363 --> 01:12:41,883
[SPEAKER_12]: Understood.

672
01:12:41,903 --> 01:12:42,644
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

673
01:12:47,487 --> 01:12:48,027
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, folks.

674
01:12:48,247 --> 01:12:48,908
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate it.

675
01:12:49,148 --> 01:12:50,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you very much.

676
01:12:51,329 --> 01:12:56,352
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for your time this evening, and we look forward to seeing you in a couple of weeks.

677
01:12:57,393 --> 01:13:06,117
[SPEAKER_07]: Just more, Natty, if you could send me a copy of the presentation that you had, just so I can put that up on the Google Drive as well, so we have it.

678
01:13:07,118 --> 01:13:07,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

679
01:13:08,279 --> 01:13:12,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually sent it to you just moments before the hearing started, so I think it should be.

680
01:13:13,041 --> 01:13:15,923
[SPEAKER_07]: I am not at my computer, so I haven't seen my email.

681
01:13:16,234 --> 01:13:19,880
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been trying to figure out a way to get my emails on this computer and I've been unable to.

682
01:13:20,301 --> 01:13:26,571
[SPEAKER_07]: So appreciate it.

683
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:26,731
[SPEAKER_10]: Great.

684
01:13:27,352 --> 01:13:27,813
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you all.

685
01:13:46,333 --> 01:13:49,835
[SPEAKER_10]: Do we have any minutes to approve, Dennis?

686
01:13:50,195 --> 01:13:50,995
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think so.

687
01:13:51,115 --> 01:13:53,196
[SPEAKER_07]: I was out for a bit, unfortunately.

688
01:13:53,216 --> 01:13:54,857
[SPEAKER_07]: I was not around.

689
01:13:54,877 --> 01:14:03,981
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm back now, but in the interim, I had five zoning decisions to write that sort of wrecked me for a bit.

690
01:14:04,021 --> 01:14:08,863
[SPEAKER_07]: So, but I know that, but I know what Jeremy wanted to talk about.

691
01:14:10,110 --> 01:14:23,701
[SPEAKER_07]: getting, because we had a member who I thought we were going to appoint, and then in the interim, basically he came back and said this time right now doesn't lend him the ability to join the commission at this point.

692
01:14:24,121 --> 01:14:32,368
[SPEAKER_07]: And Jeremy brought up the point, which is quite accurate, that I'm not sure if the delay in appointing him from when he expressed interest to now played a role.

693
01:14:32,408 --> 01:14:32,868
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope not.

694
01:14:33,549 --> 01:14:39,414
[SPEAKER_07]: But we were having issues, not just for our board, but for a number of boards' commissions.

695
01:14:40,508 --> 01:15:09,805
[SPEAKER_07]: application process was not great and we fixed it we think we've got you know because it was just i don't want to go into like a ton of overall things but it was just applications were coming in and not being seen and i would you know it was just and we not just you all it was like commission was having these issues a few other commissions were having these issues and um it seems to have been sorted so hopefully we can get i

696
01:15:10,539 --> 01:15:15,481
[SPEAKER_07]: put out calls to looking for a few other people, more members.

697
01:15:16,641 --> 01:15:23,303
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought I had another, just during this interim, somebody sent me an email, somebody who works for the state expressed an interest in joining.

698
01:15:23,363 --> 01:15:27,165
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I got back to them within a few days and they were like, actually, no, no, no, we can't.

699
01:15:27,405 --> 01:15:29,546
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was kind of excited for about 48 hours.

700
01:15:30,046 --> 01:15:39,189
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I was like, and then I contacted a friend of mine who works for Myra, asking her if she knew of any folks in the city who might be interested.

701
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:41,120
[SPEAKER_07]: she forwarded me a name.

702
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:46,182
[SPEAKER_07]: She basically was like, you know, she basically sent me an email with myself and the other person.

703
01:15:46,722 --> 01:15:50,142
[SPEAKER_07]: And I replied to that person saying, you know, can you send your information?

704
01:15:50,162 --> 01:15:51,323
[SPEAKER_07]: And they never got back to me.

705
01:15:51,883 --> 01:15:56,564
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm starting to take it personally.

706
01:15:56,604 --> 01:15:59,945
[SPEAKER_07]: But so I it

707
01:16:00,772 --> 01:16:12,716
[SPEAKER_07]: I've contacted the same person again and just said, you know, we'll not go that person's route, but if you know of anyone else, so, you know, I mean, there are a lot of volunteers, you know, people who work for Myra who live in this city.

708
01:16:12,796 --> 01:16:18,977
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I think if someone's interested in helping on Myra, they would be someone who'd be interested in the commission as well.

709
01:16:19,037 --> 01:16:19,218
[SPEAKER_07]: So.

710
01:16:21,098 --> 01:16:27,200
[SPEAKER_10]: So Myra just recently convened a steering committee for, I think,

711
01:16:28,315 --> 01:16:33,177
[SPEAKER_10]: revitalization of the bank from the Mystic Lakes to Boston Ave.

712
01:16:34,117 --> 01:16:42,361
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not important what it was, but the steering committee consisted solely of West Bedford residents, and there was like 12 people, 12-15 people.

713
01:16:42,461 --> 01:16:52,905
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a possible pool if we can be really more specific with my friends and say, hey, we know these people all went and attended several hearings.

714
01:16:54,286 --> 01:16:54,806
[SPEAKER_07]: That's great.

715
01:16:55,046 --> 01:16:56,647
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

716
01:16:56,667 --> 01:16:57,407
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll go to that round.

717
01:16:58,740 --> 01:17:02,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to join that steering committee, but I couldn't commit to a third.

718
01:17:03,126 --> 01:17:05,046
[SPEAKER_04]: third thing, unfortunately.

719
01:17:05,106 --> 01:17:06,307
[SPEAKER_04]: It was very interesting.

720
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:08,267
[SPEAKER_09]: Double duty as it is, Jeremy.

721
01:17:08,287 --> 01:17:11,868
[SPEAKER_09]: We so appreciate you representing us on the CPC.

722
01:17:12,588 --> 01:17:13,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and it's been good.

723
01:17:14,708 --> 01:17:15,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Learning a lot there.

724
01:17:16,268 --> 01:17:26,470
[SPEAKER_04]: Dennis, I will say as what I understand from Alex is that it was the delay, not specifically because of the delay, but during that time he was approached to join another board.

725
01:17:27,511 --> 01:17:27,791
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, jeez.

726
01:17:30,551 --> 01:17:34,354
[SPEAKER_04]: He didn't know what was happening with the ComCom, so he took the other position.

727
01:17:34,374 --> 01:17:37,256
[SPEAKER_04]: That's unfortunate, but OK.

728
01:17:38,137 --> 01:17:38,437
[SPEAKER_04]: It is.

729
01:17:39,198 --> 01:17:42,700
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm glad to hear that whatever issue it was is resolved.

730
01:17:42,720 --> 01:17:52,027
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be sure that if any of us are going to recommend someone, and you put yourself out there a little bit by talking up the board, that we can do that with confidence.

731
01:17:54,927 --> 01:17:58,068
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that whatever has been the issue is fixed.

732
01:17:58,488 --> 01:18:05,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if we do make more recommendations, let's do whatever we can to bang the drum so that people at the city see it.

733
01:18:09,050 --> 01:18:10,590
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my soapbox.

734
01:18:10,650 --> 01:18:10,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

735
01:18:11,451 --> 01:18:12,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.

736
01:18:12,491 --> 01:18:17,712
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, if you know anyone who

737
01:18:24,393 --> 01:18:32,899
[SPEAKER_07]: is in the city, you know, again, I, you know, we just sort of said, it's just, you know, even if they just, you know, are curious, have them, you know, give me a call, but shoot me an email.

738
01:18:32,939 --> 01:18:50,211
[SPEAKER_07]: They're just, even if they're not, you know, I sort of go over exactly what entails, you know, and just sort of give a brief little intro and, or even, or even, you know, have them come to just watch sort of a meeting from the peanut gallery, you know, sort of, you know, just observe what this commission is like.

739
01:18:50,231 --> 01:18:51,232
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that sometimes helps.

740
01:18:51,818 --> 01:18:57,541
[SPEAKER_07]: people get to sort of see what it is, see what it actually entails.

741
01:19:00,763 --> 01:19:07,567
[SPEAKER_04]: I suspect most of us end up here because we've been on the other side at some point and know the drill.

742
01:19:07,987 --> 01:19:17,392
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is helpful to get the context of what this commission is like and what kind of NOIs and inquiries we deal with versus other places.

743
01:19:20,796 --> 01:19:28,462
[SPEAKER_04]: Dennis, I also, different topic, but I owe you some comments on the South Street planting plan.

744
01:19:28,642 --> 01:19:34,146
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks like it's the same plan that was provided before.

745
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:39,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember if I sent you formal comments there or not.

746
01:19:39,591 --> 01:19:44,114
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try to dig those up, but I do have that in mind.

747
01:19:44,134 --> 01:19:45,295
[SPEAKER_07]: If I do have them, I'll let you know.

748
01:19:46,836 --> 01:19:47,817
[SPEAKER_04]: I can take a look on my end too.

749
01:19:50,025 --> 01:19:53,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Dennis, did we get something in from South Street recently?

750
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:56,270
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I haven't received anything in the last 30 days.

751
01:19:57,591 --> 01:19:58,912
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I wasn't able to.

752
01:19:59,392 --> 01:20:05,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at least the plans I'm talking about, Caroline, I wasn't able to make the last meeting, and so Dennis sent me the updated plans.

753
01:20:06,217 --> 01:20:11,081
[SPEAKER_07]: We sent some stuff out maybe about four weeks ago, five weeks ago, maybe in that time frame.

754
01:20:11,261 --> 01:20:15,965
[SPEAKER_07]: What we got from the current developer, I think the fourth one we've had.

755
01:20:16,045 --> 01:20:18,987
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll double-check to see what I've got and I'll send it off again.

756
01:20:20,106 --> 01:20:25,808
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you sent that plan to me directly, Dennis, but I'm not sure if it went to the full group.

757
01:20:26,008 --> 01:20:30,010
[SPEAKER_07]: It might have been after the meeting, but I thought it got sent out prior to the meeting, but I will double check.

758
01:20:30,710 --> 01:20:32,971
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you send me a summary, Dennis?

759
01:20:33,671 --> 01:20:36,432
[SPEAKER_00]: I must have missed that meeting at 54 South Street.

760
01:20:37,712 --> 01:20:38,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Come to a meeting?

761
01:20:40,080 --> 01:20:43,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, yeah, while you're, uh, I believe you were on your honeymoon.

762
01:20:43,742 --> 01:20:53,346
[SPEAKER_07]: So unfortunately he basically said, and he came, he actually came into the office to speak to me and he was like, I, I'd like to, and I was trying to accommodate both him and us.

763
01:20:53,466 --> 01:21:04,050
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was like, you know, cause especially cause both you and Jeremy were so actively, you know, so expressed interest in it, but he was like, I can't go this and he's like, we'll come next Wednesday.

764
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:04,591
[SPEAKER_07]: So we did it.

765
01:21:04,611 --> 01:21:05,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

766
01:21:06,290 --> 01:21:06,971
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's fine.

767
01:21:06,991 --> 01:21:07,491
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad.

768
01:21:07,531 --> 01:21:08,612
[SPEAKER_00]: So what, what happened?

769
01:21:08,792 --> 01:21:09,693
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the update?

770
01:21:10,173 --> 01:21:14,516
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have read the minutes dead, but we don't have any.

771
01:21:14,576 --> 01:21:14,857
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

772
01:21:15,297 --> 01:21:18,780
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, he basically went over the plans and basically he just seemed receptive.

773
01:21:18,880 --> 01:21:23,964
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was, it was more of a just sort of formal chat session because it wasn't a formal hearing or meeting or anything.

774
01:21:23,984 --> 01:21:33,611
[SPEAKER_07]: And we just sort of went over the planting plan that was proposed and you know, what was actually in the initial planting plan that we had.

775
01:21:33,691 --> 01:21:35,953
[SPEAKER_07]: But basically we sort of told them that that

776
01:21:36,487 --> 01:21:39,970
[SPEAKER_07]: planting plan was dependent on that tree being there.

777
01:21:39,990 --> 01:21:53,821
[SPEAKER_07]: And now that that tree is not there, you know, I think we did say to him, basically add some additional plantings to what you have to mitigate that tree coming down and yeah, don't believe them yet.

778
01:21:53,881 --> 01:21:57,744
[SPEAKER_07]: But he said he was going to get that to us when he was getting closer to actual plantings.

779
01:21:58,124 --> 01:22:01,907
[SPEAKER_07]: She's said we'll probably be in the next, you know, probably this fall planting season.

780
01:22:03,736 --> 01:22:15,926
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so yeah it sounds like we can just tell him do x y and z and that's how he'll come back into compliance and it doesn't have to be a long back and forth I don't think we could probably get it done in one.

781
01:22:16,507 --> 01:22:30,398
[SPEAKER_07]: No I mean he was he was fairly receptive you know compared to the previous developers you know once we actually found out his information and getting contact from him because the previous ones were much harder to get hold

782
01:22:33,916 --> 01:22:36,057
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thanks.

783
01:22:37,357 --> 01:22:38,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Just other updates.

784
01:22:39,178 --> 01:22:44,480
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually received word from, I was going to say Myra, but it's not Myra, it's MWRA.

785
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:51,023
[SPEAKER_07]: I think one of our last minutes we talked about the work that was being done by the little High Street Rotary.

786
01:22:51,563 --> 01:22:58,866
[SPEAKER_07]: They were doing, there's some erosion controls and things like that in preparation for some work.

787
01:22:58,906 --> 01:23:01,067
[SPEAKER_07]: They are going to be starting some work there shortly.

788
01:23:01,247 --> 01:23:02,088
[SPEAKER_07]: They just haven't told me when.

789
01:23:03,447 --> 01:23:06,009
[SPEAKER_07]: coming soon and they will let me know actually what is going on.

790
01:23:11,072 --> 01:23:13,934
[SPEAKER_08]: In that same work, I thought they were buttoning that up.

791
01:23:13,954 --> 01:23:15,935
[SPEAKER_08]: That looked like they were done over there, Dennis.

792
01:23:16,295 --> 01:23:18,337
[SPEAKER_07]: It's another one then.

793
01:23:18,637 --> 01:23:25,041
[SPEAKER_07]: I literally just got the email two days ago basically saying so.

794
01:23:25,081 --> 01:23:26,542
[SPEAKER_07]: Then it was that general area.

795
01:23:27,864 --> 01:23:30,005
[SPEAKER_08]: I noticed there's erosion controls up.

796
01:23:30,125 --> 01:23:30,745
[SPEAKER_08]: I think they're new.

797
01:23:30,785 --> 01:23:37,207
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been out of town for a few weeks on Mystic Valley Parkway by Whole Foods, and there's a new DEP file sign up.

798
01:23:40,368 --> 01:23:42,148
[SPEAKER_08]: And at least I think it's new.

799
01:23:42,188 --> 01:23:47,389
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never noticed it before, but granted, it's... It's by Whole Foods, and it's after the bridge, that Somerville.

800
01:23:48,910 --> 01:23:49,410
[SPEAKER_08]: Say that again?

801
01:23:50,930 --> 01:23:52,531
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Whole Foods

802
01:23:53,580 --> 01:24:02,602
[SPEAKER_07]: The eastern side, like the right hand side of Somerville and the road there, like basically when you, when you, you know, the traffic light before you get to Whole Foods, the one that's there.

803
01:24:03,182 --> 01:24:03,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.

804
01:24:04,302 --> 01:24:06,383
[SPEAKER_07]: After you hit that, that turns into Somerville.

805
01:24:07,483 --> 01:24:08,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, it could be Somerville then.

806
01:24:10,023 --> 01:24:14,064
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause that, that comes off now and again that every once in a while there's work going on.

807
01:24:14,624 --> 01:24:20,246
[SPEAKER_07]: That, it's, it's sort of a weird little sort of stretch that is not Medford that you think should be Medford.

808
01:24:22,186 --> 01:24:22,306
[SPEAKER_07]: And

809
01:24:23,972 --> 01:24:37,575
[SPEAKER_07]: that's happened to me more than a few times is that, yeah, so like the property line, like when you cross over that bridge there after Auburn Street, that is all Somerville.

810
01:24:38,095 --> 01:24:39,075
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can see the line there, yeah.

811
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:42,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, and it happens to be in Somerville.

812
01:24:43,236 --> 01:24:44,216
[SPEAKER_08]: So disregard.

813
01:24:45,477 --> 01:24:52,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, there's been a few times where I've gotten calls, and especially when I first started,

814
01:24:52,763 --> 01:24:56,704
[SPEAKER_07]: that I basically raced down there and I was like, oh no, they're doing work here.

815
01:24:56,744 --> 01:24:58,224
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was like, I know not knowledge of it.

816
01:24:58,285 --> 01:25:00,185
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm not alone.

817
01:25:00,205 --> 01:25:13,168
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually know one of the building inspectors who was driving down there that way and he saw some construction and went in and asked them where their building permit was and they didn't have it.

818
01:25:13,209 --> 01:25:17,170
[SPEAKER_07]: And he wrote them out all this fines and things like that.

819
01:25:17,230 --> 01:25:20,991
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when he got back to the office and he started submitting it, he discovered it was in somewhere.

820
01:25:23,044 --> 01:25:27,006
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they basically called one of his counterparts in Somerville and said, by the way, you should probably go look at this property.

821
01:25:28,107 --> 01:25:34,210
[SPEAKER_07]: So it is kind of strange.

822
01:25:34,250 --> 01:25:41,413
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you're driving on Boston Ave, you cross over the bridge, and you're in Somerville for a short hop, and then all of a sudden it jumps back to Medford.

823
01:25:41,433 --> 01:25:43,934
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a weird little cutout of the city.

824
01:25:48,917 --> 01:25:49,177
[SPEAKER_07]: And then...

825
01:25:50,169 --> 01:25:54,971
[SPEAKER_07]: We are going to, I'm expecting applications from both from the member.

826
01:25:54,991 --> 01:26:00,573
[SPEAKER_07]: We did the, uh, the initial one on our own street, the African, they just sort of take, we're sort of taking their time.

827
01:26:00,613 --> 01:26:04,675
[SPEAKER_07]: And then actually their next door neighbor wants to do a similar project.

828
01:26:04,735 --> 01:26:09,857
[SPEAKER_07]: So he actually hired an engineering firm to do like all of his stuff.

829
01:26:09,917 --> 01:26:16,240
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I mentioned that to them, they were like, can he kind of go first to sort of

830
01:26:16,983 --> 01:26:21,226
[SPEAKER_07]: get the heavy lifting done with his folks before they come back before us.

831
01:26:24,808 --> 01:26:27,790
[SPEAKER_07]: He just and I just got that yesterday.

832
01:26:27,870 --> 01:26:29,271
[SPEAKER_07]: So I haven't I'm just reviewing it now.

833
01:26:29,831 --> 01:26:31,552
[SPEAKER_07]: So we probably will be having that.

834
01:26:32,373 --> 01:26:36,996
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be not in the next one, but shortly thereafter, for our industry.

835
01:26:40,198 --> 01:26:40,678
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

836
01:26:40,858 --> 01:26:42,159
[SPEAKER_07]: That's another ally.

837
01:26:47,163 --> 01:26:50,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Nothing else is in the pipeline as far as I know.

838
01:26:51,004 --> 01:26:51,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't heard anything.

839
01:26:52,225 --> 01:26:58,346
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say the Eagle Scout project, I think I might have mentioned it in the previous one, but the Eagle Scout project went very well.

840
01:26:58,426 --> 01:27:00,667
[SPEAKER_07]: I was there for the duration of the project.

841
01:27:00,727 --> 01:27:08,929
[SPEAKER_07]: We managed to get it all done in one day, which was not easy, but it actually made it better for the project.

842
01:27:09,009 --> 01:27:14,790
[SPEAKER_07]: We were able to get the old bridge out, and they actually brought that, they were able to get the old bridge out, which was,

843
01:27:15,658 --> 01:27:16,419
[SPEAKER_07]: not easy.

844
01:27:16,579 --> 01:27:25,907
[SPEAKER_07]: They were basically myself and the scout's father and one other person were waiting down by where they put in their new bridge.

845
01:27:25,927 --> 01:27:29,249
[SPEAKER_07]: And we could just hear them, you know, making their way to us.

846
01:27:29,309 --> 01:27:35,374
[SPEAKER_07]: And it sounded like a tank running through the woods, just them trying to, they didn't want to drag it.

847
01:27:35,414 --> 01:27:37,736
[SPEAKER_07]: So they were kind of lifting it and they got up there.

848
01:27:37,816 --> 01:27:40,519
[SPEAKER_07]: So and the bridge is great.

849
01:27:40,839 --> 01:27:42,220
[SPEAKER_07]: If you haven't gone up there, I would

850
01:27:43,097 --> 01:27:44,817
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a really nice walk around.

851
01:27:45,718 --> 01:27:50,579
[SPEAKER_07]: It's much better than it was because you're not walking through the big muck of the old pathway.

852
01:27:52,419 --> 01:28:00,601
[SPEAKER_07]: And within about five minutes after they put up the notice redirecting people, two hikers walked through.

853
01:28:00,621 --> 01:28:02,782
[SPEAKER_07]: And they actually followed the new trail.

854
01:28:02,862 --> 01:28:06,163
[SPEAKER_07]: So we were like, all right, everything seems to, the new blazing seems to work.

855
01:28:06,823 --> 01:28:09,003
[SPEAKER_07]: So thankfully, so.

856
01:28:11,104 --> 01:28:12,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Thanks for overseeing that.

857
01:28:13,036 --> 01:28:13,856
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm glad it went well.

858
01:28:13,876 --> 01:28:16,717
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was great.

859
01:28:17,317 --> 01:28:19,258
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I like projects like that.

860
01:28:19,318 --> 01:28:21,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are my favorite ones.

861
01:28:21,919 --> 01:28:25,120
[SPEAKER_07]: Brett's the old scouter in me, too.

862
01:28:25,240 --> 01:28:28,561
[SPEAKER_07]: I just kind of remember my days doing that stuff like that.

863
01:28:30,222 --> 01:28:30,482
Great.

864
01:28:32,022 --> 01:28:32,943
[SPEAKER_10]: Look forward to seeing it.

865
01:28:33,943 --> 01:28:42,306
[SPEAKER_10]: But with that, if we don't have anything else, I suggest that we adjourn.

866
01:28:47,789 --> 01:29:13,354
[SPEAKER_10]: second all in favor we could all say that yes and I'll send you off the stuff as soon as I get things great thanks Dennis thank you Dennis and meeting minutes and we didn't write all right bye record
