    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=547.735s">Back</a>  in the driver's seat, Casey. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=548.996s">How</a>  are you?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=549.496s">The</a>  sports doctor, Keith O'Brien. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=551.196s">We're</a>  back in the saddle again, and we are ready for what should be a very entertaining and upbeat game tonight.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=557.718s">Yeah,</a>  this is March. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=558.638s">This</a>  is big boy basketball, Casey, as they would say. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=561.179s">And</a>  you know, West Haven comes in hot off of a win against Glastonbury. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=565.34s">New</a>  London, hot off of a win against Crosbury. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=568.22s">You</a>  know, and take a second to talk about this New London team and head coach Dave Cornish and his travels. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=573.301s">He's</a>  back home here at New London, and he's here to deliver. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=576.402s">another</a>  banner on the wall and you know what tonight's the next step to that you know that that goal that New London has had since they brought him back two years ago.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=584.646s">I</a>  want to thank you sports doctor a that's an excellent point but also I have missed your Sniglet's Crosby of Waterbury Crosbury it makes app it's pert makes perfect sense but I thought but you are spot-on when coach Cornish came back to his alma mater it's returning to a tradition of the state championship banners on the wall his legacy is <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=606.456s">is</a>  not determined by or dependent upon but would certainly resonate more if he was one of the coaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=613.718s">I</a>  mean you look up there and you see Ralph Ruggiero and you see Chop Parker. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=616.979s">If</a>  his name could be put up there and he played for and coached for and with Ralph Ruggiero and Chop Parker. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=624.6s">So</a>  you know those are his role models and his mentors and to put himself into that category would be huge for him.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=631.362s">And</a>  listen, we've known Dave for a long time. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=633.223s">This</a>  man eats and breathes basketball. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=636.145s">And</a>  I think him personally, Casey, he has that burning desire to deliver that championship. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=640.287s">I</a>  mean, he got so close that led to a little stint at NFA. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=642.989s">But</a>  now he's here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=644.35s">And</a>  I think it's personal to him to put this banner back on the wall for the Northern Whalers. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=649.012s">And</a>  he's got the goods to do it this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=650.913s">He's</a>  got a very, very deep team. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=652.334s">He's</a>  got some good seniors. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=654.495s">He's</a>  got some great role players. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=656.677s">And</a>  they're healthy. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=657.617s">And</a>  they're clicking at the right time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=659.058s">He's</a>  also spot on about the tournament. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=661.14s">When</a>  I saw him during the ECC tournament and the brackets had come out, I said, who are you going to get in the second round? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=666.725s">He</a>  goes, we're going to get Crosby. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=668.106s">I</a>  said, then what, Glassenbury? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=669.127s">He</a>  goes, no, West Haven's going to be in that game. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=670.949s">He's</a>  like, and that's the team. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=672.45s">He's</a>  like, that team can win the state championship. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=676.373s">Scared</a>  of them a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=677.354s">So</a>  he saw that coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=679.016s">He</a>  said, you know, forget. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=680.337s">He</a>  knew who the teams were going to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=681.758s">He</a>  had every bracket called. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=683.92s">He's</a>  remarkable. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=684.7s">Let's</a>  take a moment for the national anthem.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_05]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=696.958s">by</a>  the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming, whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, o'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=722.691s">And</a>  the rocket's red glare, <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=726.753s">♪</a>  The bombs bursting in air ♪ ♪ Gave proof through the night ♪ ♪ That our flag was still there ♪ ♪ O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave ♪ ♪ O'er the land of the free ♪</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=764.532s">So</a>  yeah, I think this new London team has the goods for sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=767.554s">We</a>  said it all the way back at the Classic when they were taking on St. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=770.856s">Bernard.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=771.156s">We</a>  said this is the deepest, most talented roster he's ever had, albeit Ledgerd, NFA. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=777.359s">He's</a>  had some great rosters at Ledgerd, certainly at NFA. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=780.561s">But</a>  I don't think he's ever had as deep and talented a roster as this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=784.824s">And</a>  this is going to be a very big challenge for them, because they cannot <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=788.706s">have</a>  droughts of scoring they cannot get lazy on defense they cannot get into foul trouble this is a game where they're going to have to play all the way through to win.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=798.335s">And</a>  you talk about situational basketball playing with the lead down the stretch knowing how to hang on to things and you know <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=805.402s">When</a>  you're so deep like this, who's going to step up off the bench as well? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=809.367s">I</a>  mean, we've seen it a few different times with, you know, Amir Hall or Gaskin or, you know, Jack Philliston giving you some good minutes, 2KC. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=817.016s">You</a>  know, the first couple of games, too, they've had a couple of pieces of the puzzle getting to foul trouble early, you know, whether it's Jackson, Bonet. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=823.344s">So</a>  keeping your guys on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=825.646s">in</a>  the beginning of the game, very important for this Wheeler squad.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=828.147s">Absolutely.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=828.967s">We</a>  saw in the previous game that the whole dynamic changes with Bidet off the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=835.348s">New</a>  London is not a particularly tall team. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=838.169s">They're</a>  good sized across. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=840.449s">They</a>  have length and depth. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=842.53s">But</a>  Bidet's really the anchor in the middle that gives them both defense and scoring. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=848.191s">When</a>  Philiston has to come into the game for him, they lose on the offensive end. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=852.692s">and</a>  it changes the dynamic and it increases what Savon Warren and Troy McKelvin Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=857.918s">have</a>  to do so it is definitely a little different for them so they really have to focus on keeping that five as healthy and as you know in shape on the court from a fouls perspective.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=868.71s">One</a>  of my old sayings was be productive. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=871.191s">And</a>  Baudette's one of those kids, especially, you said, from a big man standpoint on the offensive end. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=876.674s">When</a>  he's out there, he's contributing. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=878.275s">He</a>  scored 18 points the other night. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=880.136s">He</a>  got himself a little right end after some foul trouble early. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=882.517s">But</a>  he's a guy they need. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=883.878s">He</a>  does a lot of the little things, too, that people don't notice during a basketball game. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=888.58s">He</a>  plays very hard with a lot of fire. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=890.781s">I</a>  do think the first four or five minutes of this game very important. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=894.443s">See</a>  who kind of gets out of the gate and kind of sets the tone early.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=898.265s">Opening</a>  tip is sponsored by Kutcher Financial. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=902.486s">When</a>  you want more than just tips, when you want sound financial planning, go see Lee Kutcher at Kutcher Financial in New London. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=909.628s">Lee</a>  can help you with financial planning and investment, tax preparation and planning for your business and your personal needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=914.749s">So</a>  feel better about your financial decisions, go to Kutcher Financial. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=919.15s">Starting</a>  five for West Haven, Brian Tillman a senior, Aaron Johnson a junior, LaShawn Roman a junior, and a pair of sophomores, Ja'Kai Little and Kanan Morris. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=928.637s">So</a>  it's a young overall team for West Haven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=932.059s">For</a>  New London, Deshawn Phillips and Savon Warren and Jackson Baudette the three seniors, JJ Robinson the junior and Troy McKelvin Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=939.524s">the</a>  sophomore. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=940.445s">Ready</a>  to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=941.005s">Baudette</a>  will jump it against LaShawn Roman and we will be underway <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=946.694s">here</a>  in a moment.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=947.755s">Let's</a>  have some fun tonight Casey throw the records out the window when you get this deep into tournament play whether to go NCAA or high school level state tournament these teams are all good let's have some fun tonight here at the Mecca as you would call it you did not say that yet tonight.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=962.707s">Not</a>  tonight I said Madison Square Garden the Mecca the other night but I didn't want to be repetitive just got a little love from the new London alumni that was <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=973.815s">Supporting</a>  us tonight a former state champion basketball player here at New London High School wanted to wish his whalers luck and say support what game day does. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=982.239s">So</a>  Roman jumps and the tip won by Westhaven and we're underway.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=989.142s">New</a>  London come out a little man-to-man early Robinson wreaking havoc.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=995.986s">Three-man</a>  officials crew Kevin Kobelski, Ben Alamo and Christopher Parker are your three officials. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1007.137s">Very</a>  deliberate Westhaven on the first possession. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1010.619s">Pull</a>  up three is up no good, boxed out by Bidette. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1014.042s">Roman,</a>  who jumped, stepped out for the three. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1017.544s">Robinson</a>  all the way to the rack, high and scores over Roman.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1020.966s">Gets</a>  the Wailers on the board. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1021.947s">You</a>  know, and Robinson's one of those kids where the coaching staff, I mean, all 12 of them with it for the London, are constantly telling him, attack the rim, attack the rim. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1028.912s">That</a>  time you saw Robinson doing work at the finish at the glass case, he threw nothing to London.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1033.174s">We</a>  like the one-to-one coach to player ratio.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1036.142s">There's</a>  a lot of guys over there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1037.69s">Hey,</a>  they all work well together. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1039.138s">It's</a>  a great staff. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1042.156s">Brian</a>  Tillman, the senior point guard, steps into a three himself, back iron no good, Boo Boo Phillips with a rebound, he'll push, dribbles through traffic, up ahead, Warren again tries to dunk and misses again. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1054.119s">He</a>  has been trying to get that one to go and his team and the coaching staff are saying would you please just lay it in the basket. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1059.981s">But</a>  that's one of those, he wanted to get the action up early.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1062.921s">He's</a>  a half a step away for a little kiss off the glass, little George Girvin finger roll. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1067.102s">Take</a>  the easy two fella, you know.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1070.284s">It</a>  goes off Westhaven so New London will have the possession but that is an easy two. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1075.146s">So</a>  far the New London speed bothering Westhaven they've been able to get to the rack twice. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1083.35s">Robinson</a>  up the top of the key now with Tillman on him. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1087.612s">Soft</a>  defense from Tillman. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1090.433s">A</a>  lot of teams settle into zone against New London trying to make them shoot from the perimeter. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1097.435s">High</a>  screen from Padet, Robinson kicks, Phillips spot up three, no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1104.718s">And</a>  out of bounds it goes, it'll stay Whaler basketball, but only eight seconds now on the shot clock.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1110.121s">Yeah,</a>  Phillips was one of those kids the other night, first round action, Casey got hot from the three point line, a little cold the other night. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1117.304s">Find</a>  his touch and find his rhythm early.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1123.867s">Robinson</a>  to inbound, right in front of the West Haven bench. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1128.079s">Dumps</a>  to Baudette, kicked back to Robinson, drives, hangs, floats, no good, and a rebound comes down to Roman, and off to Tillman. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1141.283s">Straightaway</a>  three is up and good from Kanan Morris, the sophomore. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1155.367s">Cross</a>  court pass to Phillips, looking for McKelvin on the block, instead swinging around. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1161.13s">They</a>  will let New London shoot those threes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1163.131s">See</a>  how they attack the zone, whether it's from the side, Casey, or right down the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1167.973s">Phillips</a>  pulls up, steps up, and buries it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1170.415s">He</a>  got bailed out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1171.375s">He</a>  got double teamed. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1172.156s">He</a>  rose up, knocked down a tough two. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1173.796s">A</a>  little eight-footer for Phillips on the baseline. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1178.699s">He's</a>  a senior, and when he gets cooking, man, he is a handful.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1188.873s">Roman</a>  double-teamed finds the cutter wild shot no good and Phillips blocked Johnson but they're gonna say you got a piece that's gonna send Johnson to the line and he'll shoot too.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1201.742s">And</a>  backside boxing out who's assigned to that man Savon Warren's gonna slip in there you know the one and done one and done those are kind of the small things that one will have to do tonight.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1214.643s">It</a>  was one thing giving up the cut, but giving up the offensive rebound, that's the problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1218.185s">So</a>  they were covered to defend the cut, but they were not in position to then rebound off of it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1222.947s">That's</a>  the, when you get beat like that, it's not only the shot that you have to account for, it's the weak side rebound and they couldn't do both.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1229.471s">Especially</a>  a team like London who wants to go off of a make. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1231.732s">You</a>  know, they want to go, they want to leak out, they want to run, secure the ball first, and then get up the court. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1238.018s">But</a>  when you're going against a team like this, whether it's Warren or McKelvin or Bourdette, and even Phillips, sometimes it takes four guys on a glass.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1245.482s">Looks</a>  like West Haven might be setting up a little bit of pressure here as they brought two of their guards up off the make. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1251.385s">And</a>  they're just going to go with a little 2-1-2. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1253.947s">Which</a>  gave New London some problems the other night when Crosby ran it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1257.769s">Crosby</a>  just ran a simple 2-3. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1259.189s">New</a>  London should be experiencing how to break it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1262.031s">Look</a>  at the trap right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1263.091s">Robinson.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1269.361s">Norton's</a>  got to get somebody into the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1270.802s">This</a>  is a 2-3 zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1271.802s">They</a>  know it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1272.562s">They've</a>  got to get someone in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1275.924s">Robinson</a>  floats.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1277.685s">No</a>  good, but he'll go to the line and shoot a pair. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1279.985s">Again,</a>  Robinson getting off to an aggressive start. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1282.587s">It's</a>  his third trip to the 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1284.447s">He's</a>  got a bucket, and he's got a trip to the line for two. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1286.868s">And</a>  I guess if that's how you're going to beat the zone, you're going to reverse the ball and have him kick in and go. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1290.99s">know</a>  Robinson right now hot start here for New London.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1294.112s">And</a>  certainly when Robinson's playing with a head of steam that's when he's at his best you know yeah he was against the Whalers for you know for two years and they got used to that you know full steam ahead play he was actually a big thorn in their side because he was just relentless constantly going downhill and so now I think they've been waiting all year for him to feel acclimated here enough to</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1316.926s">I</a>  think it took him, you know, a good at least half the season to get comfortable with the, you know, with the scheme and the style and not look over his shoulders so much to the coaches. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1325.289s">But</a>  he's come on, you know, very, very well down the stretch this season, especially on a defensive end.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1330.291s">Knocks</a>  them both down.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1331.291s">Pressure</a>  here by New London.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1332.732s">New</a>  London will go into their pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1335.653s">And</a>  just a step late is Robinson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1338.254s">Here's</a>  the danger in the other direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1339.594s">And</a>  out of bounds, it goes as Phillips got a piece. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1343.015s">Bidet</a>  was trying to draw the charge.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1346.251s">Good</a>  job by Panette, protecting the rim.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1359.345s">New</a>  London comfortable letting West Haven shoot the three as well, so they'll be in that zone as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1365.351s">Second</a>  one goes up, no good from Morris Robinson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1371.045s">And</a>  it was a step in by Tillman. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1373.666s">That's</a>  a nice move right there, that step in. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1376.067s">And</a>  fortunately for Robinson, Tillman got a piece of it and went out of bounds.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1380.689s">And</a>  then Lornen likes to run off of a miss.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1387.352s">On</a>  the floor right now, the only real shooter here that, you know, Phillips, if he's spotting up, Amir Hall is their real other three-point threat. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1394.416s">We're</a>  going to get a foul. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1395.976s">Salon</a>  Warren got hit.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1398.917s">Again,</a>  that's the problem with not moving the basketball around the perimeter a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1402.958s">You</a>  get sucked into the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1404.298s">The</a>  double team comes. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1405.519s">There's</a>  nobody in the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1406.879s">Maybe</a>  Phillips has got to make his way back to the basketball and ask for it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1410.1s">That's</a>  a tough place for Warren actually to pick up his dribble. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1412.921s">He's</a>  in no man's land out there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1414.221s">Caden</a>  Gaskin into the game for New London. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1416.582s">We</a>  mentioned Amir Hall, who's battling a foot problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1419.102s">But</a>  he's their best shooter, pure shooter. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1423.163s">Phillips</a>  can knock it down as well. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1424.683s">Instead,</a>  he drives the basket, kicks out. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1427.704s">KK</a>  just into the game for three, no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1431.045s">Weak</a>  side, rebound was tipped and comes to West Haven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1436.246s">Tillman</a>  can fly with the basketball, kicks out, and Johnson has it now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1441.107s">Nice</a>  look underneath, turn around Jay, no good from Roman. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1445.128s">I</a>  think he had a little room to go closer. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1448.469s">Robinson,</a>  tied up on his way to the basket. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1452.637s">Jump</a>  ball possession arrow favors New London so they'll keep it here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1457.018s">Robinson</a>  shows you that ball just a little bit on his way to the basket. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1460.699s">Defenders</a>  come on over and they make it a good play. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1463.199s">Put</a>  that ball on the opposite side of your hip. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1465.539s">Keep</a>  it ready to roll and keep it ready to shoot.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1468.4s">Robinson</a>  inbounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1470.4s">Lob</a>  to Deshaun Phillips. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1476.202s">Crowd</a>  filtering in. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1477.382s">Good</a>  crowd here for this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1482.472s">Phillips</a>  tries to drive baseline, picks it up, dumps it down, and stolen as he was trying to go for Bidette. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1494.1s">Nice</a>  move to the basket by Roman, but he couldn't get it to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1498.784s">Gaskin</a>  with the rebound and an arm bar that he got away with. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1501.746s">Now</a>  Gaskin, little stutter step. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1507.01s">Too</a>  much one-on-one from the Whalers, and I think the coaches are going to be saying something in a second.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1517.193s">gets</a>  a hand on it knocks it out of bounds it'll stay with West Haven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1519.934s">I</a>  mean New London is extremely active on the defensive end disrupting West Haven you know a lot of hands a good job on the defensive glass offensively right now sputtering struggling against that zone.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1531.716s">Brandon</a>  Bellamy and Tyrone Ogletree check into the game no size lost by West Haven Ogletree is a big as well he's a senior as well all the way back it goes to Bellamy he'll take on the point guard responsibilities with Brian Tillman. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1546.867s">We'll</a>  see if Bellamy is a little bit more of a shooter. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1549.528s">And</a>  New London will have to come out of the zone if he is, or extend the zone if he is. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1558.53s">And</a>  there it is, corner three, up short. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1561.691s">McKelvin</a>  gets the rebound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1563.751s">Gaskin,</a>  ahead to Robinson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1567.232s">He's</a>  tied up, finds McKelvin. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1569.273s">McKelvin,</a>  left hand, wild shot, no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1572.153s">Baudette,</a>  offensive rebound, misses the bunny.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1575.532s">Four</a>  different shots, four different layups tonight right now in the London's Mist. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1580.973s">Easy</a>  opportunities, they earn them with the offensive rebounds, they can't convert.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1585.374s">Badette</a>  was in such good position for the offensive rebound, and that's a shot, I mean, he wasn't even challenged, which he's used to being, and ends up missing what is almost a guaranteed make for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1598.277s">Pull</a>  up jumper in the lane, soft touch goes down for Morris. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1604.357s">He's</a>  got five of their seven.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1605.938s">Friendly</a>  rim. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1607.939s">Hit</a>  three different parts of the rim. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1609.079s">Go</a>  down to find the bottom of the net.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1612.641s">Phillips</a>  for three. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1613.862s">No</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1614.402s">McKelvin,</a>  weak side rebound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1616.283s">Knocked</a>  out of bounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1617.203s">It'll</a>  be West Haven ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1619.704s">And</a>  I think McKelvin got bumped, and that's what he's saying, but it was off of him. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1626.087s">22-22</a>  was our score in the first, in the Whalers-Crosby game the other night. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1631.33s">It's</a>  7-6 with 147 remaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1641.131s">Long</a>  pass, three on two here for Westhaven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1644.872s">Pull</a>  up three, no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1646.572s">Phillips</a>  high for the rebound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1647.953s">Great</a>  job by Nolan again, one and done. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1650.873s">Robinson,</a>  wild, blocked. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1656.115s">Coming</a>  in the other direction now is Westhaven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1663.996s">Pull</a>  up, jump shot is good from Brian Tillman. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1667.797s">And</a>  the lead is three. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1669.778s">Yep,</a>  nice jump shot.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1685.742s">Dump</a>  down to McKelvin on the block. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1688.323s">Rises</a>  up and buries a baseline jump shot.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1691.084s">That's</a>  a big time shot from the sophomore. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1692.964s">The</a>  turn, the look, rise up, catch it high, shoot it high. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1696.365s">Troy</a>  McKelvin Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1698.186s">Robinson</a>  gets the steal.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1699.866s">Phillips</a>  heads to the basket. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1703.046s">and</a>  finishes at the rim over Bellamy, and just like that the Wailers are on top. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1708.689s">And</a>  another turnover, that's the lunch pail work the Wailers like to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1712.31s">Bidette</a>  with a smart play. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1715.052s">Gaskin,</a>  again they hold it up, the shot clock and game clock are effectively even, it's about a half a second difference. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1723.336s">So</a>  the Wailers can have a lead in the last shot if they choose so.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1726.653s">Gaskin</a>  with ready hands in the corner, ready to shoot the three if the ball comes his way.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1730.735s">Normally</a>  that's Amir Hall's spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1732.436s">He's</a>  their spot up shooter, but we haven't seen him yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1735.437s">Look</a>  for a little clear out here for Robinson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1738.619s">Gets</a>  it underneath, loses it, saves it long. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1742.281s">Five</a>  seconds, West Haven now has a chance to get a shot off. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1745.882s">Step</a>  back, good if it goes, and in and out. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1749.284s">10-9</a>  at the end of one. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1751.105s">We'll</a>  be right back with second quarter action. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1752.846s">You're</a>  watching Game Day Live on the Day.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1755.467s">Gameday</a>  is brought to you by Waterford Dental Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1759.03s">Gear</a>  up for gameday with a winning smile from Waterford Dental Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1763.233s">Located</a>  in Waterford, where you're go-to for top-notch dental care in a relaxed, friendly setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1768.536s">Whether</a>  you need a routine checkup, a cosmetic boost, or advanced treatment, our experienced team has you covered. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1774.32s">Enjoy</a>  the game with confidence and comfort. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1776.762s">Schedule</a>  your appointment today. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1778.423s">Waterford</a>  Dental Health, where your smile is our top priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1781.905s">Visit</a>  us online or call now to book. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1785.345s">Ladies</a>  and gentlemen, the pressure is on. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1787.786s">Your</a>  financial future awaits. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1790.246s">At</a>  Kutcher Financial in New London, Connecticut, financial advisor Lee Kutcher offers a path forward. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1796.228s">For</a>  individuals and businesses, Lee provides steady guidance, aligning your financial goals and investment strategies with your needs. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1804.85s">Lee</a>  also offers bookkeeping and payroll services for your business. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1809.231s">When</a>  you're looking to help secure your future, see Lee Kutcher. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1816.18s">One</a>  point lead for the Whalers after one and you know Sports Doctor we saw a monumentally poor shooting night from Crosby two nights ago and only a slightly better shooting night by New London. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1828.163s">Tonight</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1829.912s">West</a>  Haven's not shooting the ball particularly well either, but New London has given gift after gift.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1834.653s">They've</a>  seen this zone defense all year long. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1837.414s">It</a>  just seems like they're not executing. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1839.594s">The</a>  ball is not moving. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1841.435s">It</a>  can't be all about Robinson and dribble penetration. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1844.316s">Reverse</a>  the basketball, find the cracks in the zone, find the action on the back end, but it just seems like it's extremely stagnant right now for New London. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1853.418s">Like</a>  you said, without Amir Hall out there with the threat of a three-point shot, they're easy to defend. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1857.539s">Right</a>  to the rack.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1859.912s">Ja'Kai</a>  Little puts Westhaven back on top.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1868.398s">And</a>  again, no movement, nobody flashing to the center, Bourdette trying to post, but not a real offensive threat, not making himself available.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1876.944s">Robinson,</a>  pump fakes, kicks out, now Gaskin drives, floater blocked, out of bounds, it'll stay with the Whalers, and Savon Warren's gonna check back into the ballgame.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1887.533s">You</a>  know, we've talked about creating a look on the perimeter against the zone. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1892.315s">If</a>  it's not passing the ball around the perimeter, maybe it's going inside, then back outside. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1896.996s">So</a>  if Gaskin's got a spot up, if Phillips has got a spot up, create some room that way.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1903.465s">Active</a>  hands by West Haven knocks the inbounds pass away.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1907.827s">And</a>  one thing you notice too, Casey, is any kind of lazy pass tonight is going to be contested. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1913.029s">It's</a>  going to be tipped. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1914.729s">You</a>  know, West Haven is too fast, too big, and too talented to get away with lazy passes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1919.671s">McKelvin</a>  gets the inbound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1922.212s">Phillips</a>  for three, no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1924.253s">Baudette,</a>  offensive rebound and he can't get it to go, but Warren flies in for the tip and they needed that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1930.636s">Get</a>  on top again by a point. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1931.837s">Crash</a>  the glass, relentless.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1934.158s">Savon</a>  Warren at the cup. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1936.419s">And</a>  again, Baudette normally converts these opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1939.781s">He's</a>  given himself easy chances. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1942.483s">Knock</a>  him in, son.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1944.198s">Robinson</a>  on the weak side block that numbers Morris had it instead Warren the other direction and they're gonna call him for the travel. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1952.521s">New</a>  London can't seem to get out of their own way right now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1955.922s">But</a>  they're creating things they're putting themselves in a position to turnovers the block shots the numbers the leak out settle down gather yourself a little bit out there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1971.122s">Down</a>  it goes, they have a double team and another steal as they took it from Roman. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1975.465s">Robinson</a>  the other direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1977.546s">High</a>  off the glass, no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1979.688s">McKelvin</a>  turns it around and buries the short. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1982.95s">Put</a>  back from about five feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1984.751s">The</a>  Whalers up three.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1996.6s">London</a>  back to a man. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=1999.602s">Tillman.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2003.865s">Now</a>  Little. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2007.468s">Up</a>  on top to Aaron Johnson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2009.79s">He</a>  pulls up for three. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2011.231s">No</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2013.433s">Contested</a>  by Warren. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2016.496s">Other</a>  direction now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2017.457s">Robinson.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2021.921s">Bidet</a>  calls for it on the block. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2024.583s">Instead,</a>  Whalers will go perimeter. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2026.185s">They</a>  want to give it in to McKelvin. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2027.726s">On</a>  the baseline, he has it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2032.803s">Now</a>  Bidette comes and sets a screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2034.724s">Robinson</a>  uses the screen, kicks it back to Bidette. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2037.525s">Shot</a>  clock down to 10. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2039.466s">Shot</a>  clock down to eight. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2040.586s">Phillips</a>  tries to create on his own. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2043.207s">Wild</a>  shot, no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2044.968s">And</a>  Westhaven's gonna run. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2046.508s">Up</a>  ahead of everybody. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2048.069s">Running</a>  the floor and missing it was Ja'Kai Little. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2052.291s">Robinson</a>  and Phillips have done a great job contesting layups. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2058.553s">Westhaven</a>  extending a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2063.205s">Bedeck</a>  puts it on the floor and gets a foul called against Ja'Kai Little.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2068.026s">And</a>  in an offensive end, Phillips looks a little bit out of sorts. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2070.747s">Casey,</a>  he takes one dribble, he picks it up at the top of the key. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2073.948s">He</a>  kind of kills himself up there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2075.709s">He's</a>  going to come out, and I'm sure the coach is going to talk to him. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2077.769s">But</a>  keep that dribble alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2079.59s">Be</a>  productive. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2080.25s">Do</a>  something with the basketball. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2081.87s">You</a>  know, the pounding and the dribbling and then picking it up, it's not creating anything out there for the Whalers. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2086.132s">Phillips</a>  is a better basketball player than that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2088.152s">Jameer</a>  Hall checks into the game for New London. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2091.573s">And</a>  so does Jack Philliston, Baudette, and Phillips have a seat. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2096.836s">So</a>  look for your scoring here to come through Robinson and Warren. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2102.119s">And</a>  a turnover on the inbound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2109.923s">Into</a>  the game, into the lane rather, Tillman.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2118.002s">Tillman</a>  handles the ball an awful lot. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2119.764s">A</a>  lot of responsibility in the young man's hands. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2124.391s">The</a>  senior.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2126.393s">Step</a>  back, pull back. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2127.675s">Glass</a>  is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2128.877s">Tillman</a>  knocks down the shot in a timeout. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2132.061s">West</a>  Haven, as they've cut it to one.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2136.865s">Well,</a>  good ballgame. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2137.686s">I</a>  mean, you feel like New London, if they could convert on some of these easy opportunities, Casey, they'd be up by a half dozen or so.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2145.718s">14-13</a>  New London. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2146.639s">We'll</a>  take a quick break. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2147.46s">You're</a>  watching Game Day Live on theday.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2158.589s">Game</a>  Day is brought to you by Waterford Dental Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2162.152s">Gear</a>  up for game day with a winning smile from Waterford Dental Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2166.375s">Located</a>  in Waterford, where you're go-to for top-notch dental care in a relaxed, friendly setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2171.659s">Whether</a>  you need a routine checkup, a cosmetic boost, or advanced treatment, our experienced team has you covered. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2177.523s">Enjoy</a>  the game with confidence and comfort. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2179.905s">Schedule</a>  your appointment today. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2181.546s">Waterford</a>  Dental Health, where your smile is our top priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2185.048s">Visit</a>  us online or call now to book. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2191.491s">We're</a>  back second quarter 445 remaining in the half 1413 New London if you're interested in the other quarterfinal that this game will match up with NFA with a one-point lead in the basketball with 15 seconds as they take on innovation trying to <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2209.723s">create</a>  a all ECC semifinal the first half of it is in NFA's hands right now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2214.966s">Boy</a>  this league has done extremely well in the state tournament both sides girls and boys and I'm a huge Jeff Brown fan.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2221.429s">Griswold</a>  has a chance tonight as well talk a little bit about them. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2225.371s">Hall</a>  brings it up the floor Phillips back in the game and a kick ball.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2232.855s">Westhaven</a>  back into the zone Casey off the timeout looking to trap <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2237.581s">At</a>  the top of the key look at the trap when the ball moves and the one who's going to get that thing cooking side to side flash somebody to the middle find the open spots. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2248.544s">You</a>  know right now in this point of this game with four and a half minutes ago before half and Phillips is going to find himself a little bit on the offensive end.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2254.486s">I</a>  mean he's got to be the scorer here with Warren McKelvin can work around the block but Hall and Philliston are not much of the offensive threat. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2266.592s">Warren,</a>  beautiful look underneath to McKelvin, basket is good, and the foul. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2272.033s">And</a>  nobody, nobody has seen more banners here than Troy McKelvin, senior and junior would love to add another.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2278.635s">Well</a>  again, that's the look that time, you know, McKelvin making himself available on the baseline, hanging around, getting ready hands, son, for two at the rim and flexing a little muscle, I like that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2289.758s">You</a>  know, and a good look that time by Warren, you know, recognize him out of the corner of his eye that dished in the delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2295.521s">I</a>  like the patience, right?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2296.701s">We</a>  looked around a little bit instead of just blindly flying to the basket, which has been part of their issue. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2302.944s">Take</a>  a moment, survey.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2306.566s">You</a>  know, a lot of their misses at the rim, Casey, you feel have been rushed a little bit, you know, by Baudette, by Warren, except great patience that time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2319.354s">Four</a>  minutes, halfway through the second quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2322.636s">Three-point</a>  Whaler lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2326.559s">Wild</a>  shot by Tillman, no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2330.721s">And</a>  a foul as McKelvin was harassed after the rebound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2336.005s">And</a>  that foul will go against West Haven.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2338.506s">It's</a>  the third of the quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2340.668s">Tillman,</a>  the guilty party of the region after the miss, the frustration. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2345.431s">Brian</a>  Tillman to the rim. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2346.431s">The</a>  timing's a bit of a wild shot, out of control. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2350.151s">No</a>  hoop, but to harm.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2352.192s">That's</a>  correct. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2353.493s">Bidette</a>  back in the ball game, giving. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2357.396s">Looks</a>  like Philliston is still in. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2358.537s">So</a>  Bidette gives McKelvin a breather. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2362.919s">And</a>  Robinson in as well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2364.641s">Phillips</a>  will sit down.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2368.423s">Philliston,</a>  that's a good idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2371.065s">That's</a>  a great idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2372.126s">He</a>  wanted Bidette to cut and pass it before he's open, to where he's going to be open. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2376.468s">That's</a>  a smart idea. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2377.609s">The</a>  quarterback knew what he was doing. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2382.715s">Ball's</a>  tipped, no backcourt. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2386.017s">10</a>  seconds on the shot clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2387.138s">Warren</a>  soars, can't get it to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2390.2s">Rebound.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2391.881s">Strong,</a>  up high by Morris. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2395.883s">Three</a>  coming right back the other way by Morris, no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2399.185s">Hall</a>  ahead to Robinson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2400.967s">Robinson</a>  turns on the Jets and he's stripped as he heads to the basket. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2404.889s">Looks</a>  like we're going to get a foul. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2411.342s">And</a>  congratulations to Jeff Brown and the NFA Wildcats, who are in the semifinals of Division II after they beat Innovation 56-53. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2422.892s">Juice</a>  beforehand said, watch the Wildcats. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2427.636s">And</a>  if the Whalers can do their business tonight, we could have an all-ECC semi, which would be remarkable.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2433.121s">And</a>  again, you throw the records out this time of year when you get hot and you get a couple of kids believing in themselves and you get rolling on a bit of a mission, you know, tough, tough, stop.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2442.306s">It</a>  also helps if you get a couple upsets, you know, you can avoid a certain team, get a matchup to get yourself going. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2448.328s">You</a>  know, they had to win four games.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2449.349s">Innovation</a>  was number two, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2450.89s">No,</a>  and it's a tough, tough team.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2452.43s">But</a>  I think you'd, I think you'd choose innovation over this West Haven team that beat NFL by 30.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2456.692s">Yeah,</a>  I would think so.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2457.913s">So,</a>  you know, it has to be a little bit lucky. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2459.775s">And</a>  if they get New London, New London's going to beat them, try to beat them for the fourth time. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2463.638s">And</a>  they've been around it the whole time. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2465.179s">So</a>  hanging around, hanging around, they got alligator blood. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2467.961s">So</a>  you've got to love it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2469.403s">Both</a>  free throws made by Robinson puts the lead up to five, the biggest lead of the game for New London.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2474.727s">I</a>  think Coach Cornish has got to be really pleased with the defensive effort of this team right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2479.471s">Only</a>  allowed 13 points. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2480.792s">They're</a>  hitting the boards, you know, one and done in the offensive end for West Haven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2486.383s">Nobody's</a>  in foul trouble right now for New London. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2488.824s">He's</a>  kind of finding that right recipe, kind of who to sub in and who to take out.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2494.707s">Matthew</a>  Morgan into the game for West Haven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2496.968s">First</a>  time we've seen him. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2498.469s">I'm</a>  waiting for that wing shooter. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2500.25s">West</a>  Haven has it because that's the shot that's available. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2503.192s">They</a>  haven't had a pure knockdown guy yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2509.335s">Bellamy</a>  passes it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2511.216s">There's</a>  Morgan swinging it around to Morris.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2515.267s">Wide</a>  open corner, open look three, up and buried by Aaron Johnson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2519.729s">Johnson</a>  the rise up, the catch and shoot, the delivery. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2523.21s">Here's</a>  your corner ball for the three ball for the corner pocket Casey.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2526.691s">Wide</a>  open corner three, we love those here on game day. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2530.973s">Dump</a>  down Bidette, soft touch finish, catch, shoot.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2535.415s">Well</a>  there you go and Savon Warren throwing the ball up high where his big man can get it and no hesitation. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2540.997s">The</a>  turn, the look, the delivery for two.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2544.651s">I</a>  can tell you already that Morgan's a shooter because he's running the baseline corner to corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2549.655s">That's</a>  where you bring yourself up. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2550.956s">That's</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2553.338s">And,</a>  you know, they're going to get out here on Johnson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2555.12s">He</a>  just shot one. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2555.9s">He</a>  comes right back again. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2557.902s">Oh,</a>  Aaron Johnson's on fire already. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2560.464s">And</a>  it's a one point lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2565.548s">Like</a>  Vinnie Johnson, the microwave.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2567.79s">Instant</a>  offense.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2574.639s">And</a>  by the way, those were rise up contested. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2577.403s">Other</a>  direction, Savon Warren with a three, no good and it's off West Haven and McKelvin will check back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2589.08s">So</a>  142-35 on the shot clock.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2592.183s">Boy,</a>  how quickly the tides can turn when you've got a seven point lead or a six point lead and the other team starts knocking them down from behind the arc.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2599.765s">And</a>  those were, I'd give that, you know, I'd give that, that second one was a contested rise up, you know, square up. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2606.087s">So</a>  you can't do much better than that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2608.148s">A</a>  man in his grill, hand in your face. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2611.329s">Johnson's</a>  got great length though. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2613.41s">Yes,</a>  he does.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2619.35s">Robinson,</a>  to Warren, looking for Baudet on the dump down, back up top.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2623.293s">Great</a>  job by Bellamy, face guarding Phillips, got number one versus number one, and Dave wants to talk it over in the last minute and a half, and I don't blame him. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2632.178s">Phillips</a>  right now in the offensive end, even though having a hard time getting himself open, can't a little shake and bake get rid of his guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2637.962s">Brandon</a>  Bellamy, great job on the defensive end right now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2641.622s">So</a>  we've got semifinal action in division one we know that the St. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2645.786s">Bernard</a>  Saints after a nice win last night against Staples is in a I mean you can't look at the you look at the D1 semis it is the elite of the elite St. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2654.794s">Bernard</a>  he's Catholic and Notre Dame Notre Dame no BC in any of the semifinals however two Notre Dames so <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2665.005s">It's</a>  just a shot at my right here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2666.727s">He</a>  gets it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2667.868s">Division</a>  two. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2668.548s">We</a>  see NFA first ones to get to the semis. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2672.532s">You</a>  know, division five. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2673.613s">We</a>  got that great Grasso tech old line.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2676.035s">You</a>  know, they're all got Fitch in the semifinal.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2677.836s">Fitch</a>  has got a great draw. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2679.278s">They</a>  got McMahon. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2681.179s">The</a>  ECC has done very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2682.42s">The</a>  locals have done very well. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2683.521s">But</a>  I go, you know, this one right here, you know, give NFA all the credit. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2687.445s">This</a>  one right here is going to be contested all the way through, I believe. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2695.838s">Robinson</a>  picks the dribble up now for Phillips. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2699.641s">Underneath,</a>  Bidet, Pumphrey, harassed, no, his own offensive rebound, no, third chance, no, McKelvin, no, Warren, stripped. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2711.592s">That's</a>  about six chances for a new arm. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2713.273s">Four</a>  shots, point blank range. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2717.644s">Warren</a>  loses it, finds McKelvin, he's harassed. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2721.787s">Back</a>  to Warren, can't handle it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2723.649s">Rise</a>  up jumper, and finally, after about shot seven, the Whalers are up three.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2728.893s">Well,</a>  there's a term this time of year we call it either win ugly or lose pretty. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2732.576s">That's</a>  win and ugly right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2733.797s">Five</a>  knocks at the rim. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2735.178s">It's</a>  also win in advance, right? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2736.619s">Yeah,</a>  survive in advance.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2738.54s">Survive</a>  in advance. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2740.001s">Right</a>  now, three point lead for the Whalers. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2744.565s">Eight</a>  second difference between the shot clock and the game clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2749.495s">Three,</a>  up, no good, back iron. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2752.516s">Phillips</a>  with a high rebound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2753.757s">Whalers</a>  can get the last shot of the quarter if they want it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2759.299s">Robinson</a>  with a three, no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2761.18s">Warren</a>  finds Bedette, put back, no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2765.061s">Out</a>  of bounds with 6.8. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2766.502s">The</a>  Whalers will have it with 6.8 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2774.725s">Whalers</a>  got a break and they just can't finish around the rim right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2778.847s">Robinson</a>  will take a break here with the last 6.8 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2782.07s">Hall</a>  comes in for him. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2785.433s">Hall</a>  will inbound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2791.819s">Dumps</a>  down to Warren. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2793.14s">Warren,</a>  pump fake, kicks back. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2795.222s">Hall</a>  for three, good! <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2797.924s">Oh</a>  boy! <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2800.241s">Jameer</a>  Hall with a big three at the end of the quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2804.223s">Dave</a>  Cornish is all kinds of fired up. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2807.784s">He</a>  is thrilled the Whalers have a six point lead and he is going to talk to the sports doctor in a moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2813.686s">What</a>  a big shot but he goes over first to Jameer Hall and says great job knocking it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2818.968s">Sports</a>  doctors with coach Cornish.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2822.023s">Dave,</a>  a big lift on your haul for a corner three. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2825.024s">Talk</a>  about the defensive end though. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2826.725s">You</a>  held that good team to 19 points in the first half.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2829.326s">Yeah,</a>  but we lost Aaron on two corner threes down here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2835.309s">I'm</a>  a little disappointed about that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2837.25s">But</a>  other than that, we've been playing pretty good.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2839.15s">You</a>  guys have been giving yourselves second, third, fourth chance scoring opportunities on the offensive end. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2844.813s">If</a>  you could convert a few more of those tonight, Dave.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2847.514s">Yeah,</a>  I mean, we've done that all year. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2848.975s">We've</a>  hit the offensive glass. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2850.896s">So</a>  if we can continue to do that, hopefully we don't need to do that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2853.879s">Hopefully</a>  we can make the shot and we don't need to hit the offensive side.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=2856.841s">Good</a>  luck in the second half, coach.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3554.418s">McKelvin</a>  flashes, but nothing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3556.299s">Bidet</a>  pulls up from about 10 feet, no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3559.682s">Ball</a>  tipped on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3562.063s">West</a>  Haven's got numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3564.845s">And</a>  oh, what a block by Boo Boo Phillips.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3568.348s">Big</a>  time on a defensive end, number one squaring things up, sending it back. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3574.652s">Phillips</a>  saw that coming the whole way in front of him and timed his jump perfectly. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3578.315s">That's</a>  an ouchie. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3578.715s">Look</a>  at this right here, boom, get out of here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3582.62s">Hall</a>  into the game for New London after knocking down that three at the end of the half. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3586.242s">We'll</a>  see if they're going to run some things through him.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3593.285s">It's</a>  a small little play like that at defensive end it kind of welcomes Phillips into the game a little bit too.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3597.687s">I</a>  don't like the second half start for either team. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3602.769s">I</a>  love what West Haven's trying to do.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3605.931s">Miss</a>  there in the lane but they've made a commitment to get the ball to the big man down low. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3611.537s">Get</a>  to the rim, create some easy scoring opportunities.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3615.518s">Phillips</a>  gets a step, drives, hangs, and an offensive foul. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3619.68s">And</a>  saw that coming a mile away. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3621.601s">Great</a>  job, Kanan Morris.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3623.721s">Morris</a>  holding his ground. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3625.762s">Phillips</a>  coming right down the pipe. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3628.383s">Good</a>  job by Morris on the defensive end. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3630.264s">4-0</a>  run out of the chute. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3637.166s">Second</a>  foul on Phillips for West Haven.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3648.26s">Tillman</a>  has a mismatch with Baudet on him. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3653.783s">All</a>  the way to the basket.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3654.804s">That</a>  could take Ty Little, yeah. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3657.966s">He</a>  took the bump, the finish, the hoop, and just like that, 6-0 run. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3665.83s">We're</a>  tied at 25.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3671.614s">Tillman</a>  harassing Robinson.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3677.115s">How</a>  quickly your lead evaporates when you're not converting on the offensive end. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3681.12s">Westhaven's</a>  made some adjustments. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3683.002s">Everything</a>  right now is close by the rim.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3686.566s">Robinson,</a>  stutter step, finds McKelvin. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3688.588s">McKelvin,</a>  short jumper, no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3691.171s">Phillips</a>  with the offensive rebound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3692.673s">He</a>  draws the foul. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3696.604s">You</a>  know, one thing, too, without Amir Hall available to them, and he hasn't been in the game, which makes me feel like he may not be available. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3703.048s">They</a>  really don't have a lights-out three-point shoot. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3705.71s">They</a>  do not. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3706.33s">And</a>  if he was on the floor, that would extend that zone just enough. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3709.372s">And</a>  right now, they don't have to come out on anybody.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3711.293s">Yeah,</a>  whether it's Jameer in the game, and Gaskin showed you some flashes early, but couldn't knock one down. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3718.038s">Savon</a>  Warren's been a little helter-skelter from the three-point line. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3722.18s">No</a>  real offensive threat from behind the arc. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3724.361s">I</a>  mean, I think Phillips is going to have to be that guy to get things moving.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3727.023s">They've</a>  knocked down one three. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3728.103s">And</a>  that was the Hall three at the end of the half. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3732.205s">Free</a>  throws. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3733.386s">One</a>  of two. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3734.086s">Lead</a>  is one. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3734.967s">Pressure.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3738.049s">Great</a>  trap that time by McKelvin and Phillips. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3741.37s">And</a>  a timeout by Westhaven.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3743.191s">Timeout</a>  Westhaven, as Ty Sullivan wants to talk it over because this guy was in a dangerous position, trapped in the corner. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3751.132s">30</a>  second timeout, so we'll keep it here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3753.697s">New</a>  London's gonna go right into the trap, Casey, after a make or after a free throw. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3758.386s">And</a>  a great job that time by McKelvin and Phillips, getting West Haven pinned in. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3765.835s">So</a>  the second half of this game, though, it seems like West Haven has kind of come out and made some sort of adjustment. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3774.238s">On</a>  the offensive end, whether it's get the ball to the rack, get yourself some easy opportunities. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3779.039s">And</a>  the London came out firing a three ball.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3781.72s">Well,</a>  I think what Westhaven said, if I could guess, was we're going to up the offensive tempo. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3789.364s">We're</a>  going to move the ball better offensively and we're going to make a commitment to getting it in the paint towards the bigs. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3796.067s">Defensively,</a>  Westhaven said, we're going to sag and give them all the three, bait them. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3801.85s">And</a>  then to their credit, New London missed some threes and that helps Westhaven get out and push, which is what they're trying to do. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3811.823s">Pressure</a>  by New London. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3817.006s">Sort</a>  of the soft 2-3. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3821.028s">And</a>  they'll drop back in. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3825.891s">Turnover</a>  as Roman hit the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3829.693s">Robinson</a>  finds Phillips. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3831.554s">Couple</a>  of pump fakes and boo-boo for two.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3833.835s">Yeah,</a>  run on the floor that time and Robinson with a little handoff delivery to Phillips. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3838.037s">Phillips</a>  converting.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3840.355s">And</a>  right into the pressure comes New London. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3842.238s">They</a>  got Johnson trapped. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3843.439s">He</a>  finds his man underneath. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3844.681s">Bidet's</a>  behind. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3846.483s">And</a>  a soft touch, though, goes down. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3848.706s">Kane</a>  and Morris keeps getting those nice bounces like he's a New London guy. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3852.992s">The</a>  home rim. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3853.593s">The</a>  friendly rim. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3859.589s">Phillips</a>  pulls up in the traffic, finds Baudette, and there's a nice look and a nice finish.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3864.193s">Well,</a>  you know, I like the way Baudette makes himself available. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3866.695s">He</a>  shows, he seals his man off at the back end and a turnover here for New London, possibly.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3872.801s">Can</a>  he save it? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3873.561s">He</a>  does. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3874.142s">But</a>  who's going to get it? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3875.603s">It's</a>  like a greased pig. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3877.044s">Finally,</a>  it comes down and way ahead. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3880.848s">And</a>  finishing is Aaron Johnson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3882.769s">So</a>  a little bit of bad luck there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3884.391s">New</a>  London went from turnover <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3887.447s">And</a>  Baudette! <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3888.908s">Oh!</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3889.669s">Jackson</a>  Baudette!</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3892.451s">Is</a>  that Cajun for Thunder? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3895.794s">Right</a>  back on the wheel is the Jims Alive.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3905.402s">Other</a>  direction.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3906.082s">Oh,</a>  how did that go down?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3907.543s">Shot</a>  little. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3908.564s">Sha'Kai</a>  Little played big. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3913.708s">Now</a>  we're starting to warm it up a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3922.861s">Baudette</a>  from the free throw line, no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3925.721s">Tipped</a>  by Robinson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3927.102s">Robinson</a>  gets the rebound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3930.242s">And</a>  we're gonna get a foul, which a good call on Tillman.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3933.603s">Right,</a>  and Robinson does a great job selling it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3937.443s">You</a>  know, we see it in the NBA all the time with the head bob and the arms going up in the air. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3941.644s">It</a>  could have been a held ball, but Robinson sells that so well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3945.905s">Gaskin</a>  into the game from McKelvin. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3949.726s">McKelvin</a>  is reaching for his calf. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3953.135s">I</a>  think maybe a little cramp action, he's gonna see the trainer. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3960.26s">Robinson</a>  will inbound.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3961.34s">Officials</a>  get together.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3974.449s">Nothing</a>  there, so they go high to Gaskin. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3978.771s">Phillips.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3980.434s">Drives</a>  to the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3981.834s">Hall,</a>  spot up three. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3983.515s">Got</a>  it!</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3985.535s">Jameer</a>  Hall, two for two from behind the arc. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3988.856s">Big</a>  time delivery in the stroke. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3991.357s">Phillips</a>  with the recognition, kick out to the wing. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3993.997s">And</a>  here comes London, on the turnover case.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=3996.578s">Hands</a>  from Hall, and Gaskins wisely gave it up. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4001.559s">Phillips</a>  inside, no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4003.84s">Gaskins</a>  tips it to Baudette, and Baudette's gonna draw the foul. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4008.301s">and</a>  Johnson's down on the floor as he landed hard, but a good sequence for the Wailers.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4012.923s">Yeah,</a>  last couple trips to New London, creating offense off of a second chance scoring opportunity. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4017.545s">You</a>  saw Robinson get in the mix, this time you see Phillips getting in, keeping the ball alive on the second chance opportunity, and Bourdette, Johnny on the spot once again for New London.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4026.429s">That</a>  was Ogletree, he's up. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4029.15s">I</a>  apologize, it was not Aaron Johnson, it was Tyrone Ogletree, but he's up and he's okay, and Baudette will shoot too. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4034.592s">You</a>  know, in the Crosby game, I said Jameer Hall <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4037.66s">was</a>  playing like it was just one click he was one click off you know I mean he was a little too fast a little too slow couldn't quite get this game he has been locked in and quite frankly New London would not be where they are right now without the play of Jameer Hall that was his slap away that led to these two free throws for Bidet.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4054.607s">You've</a>  got to be ready when your number is called when you're coming off the bench to be productive and knock down shots and Jameer Hall calmly has done that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4065.403s">One</a>  more free throw for Jackson, Baudette, the Whaler lead is back to five. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4075.814s">Smooth,</a>  isn't he? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4077.436s">Knocks</a>  him both down, lead six, Whaler staying a little bit of pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4084.715s">Tillman</a>  the savvy guard though Little into the corner now Ogletree back up top Hall almost had the steal but Little just rose up above him and then we're gonna get a touch foul out on the perimeter.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4096.02s">Cheapie</a>  out there by Gaskin you know he kind of lets his man turn the corner gets a little too handsy but that's a dangerous pass coming back with Hall challenging it by Westhaven.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4111.166s">Inbounding</a>  from the far side now will be Tillman <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4115.067s">We're</a>  gonna get Matthew Morgan back into the ballgame for Westhaven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4121.889s">Ogletree</a>  will have a seat.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4127.351s">I</a>  like this lineup in there right now for New London, giving them a spark.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4132.272s">Little</a>  mismatch, Tillman had Bidette beat. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4137.014s">Bidette</a>  recovered though nicely. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4139.175s">Now</a>  Tillman will spot up for a three, no good, Bidette gets the rebound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4144.737s">McKelvin</a>  trying to walk off a little leg strength. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4148.261s">Hall</a>  all the way to the basket, finds Baudette and he can't get it to go down because he wasn't ready for the pass. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4153.607s">No</a>  he was not. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4158.153s">Morgan</a>  for three, no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4163.319s">Offensive</a>  rebound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4165.252s">and</a>  getting to the basket and causing a foul is Kanan Morris, he'll shoot two, and Morris has been spectacular for West Haven every time they've needed a big play.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4173.498s">Yeah,</a>  he's been a lunch pail guy, Casey, on the offensive glass, second chance scoring opportunities, the turn and face and a couple of jump shots, but just a guy that's gonna do some dirty work in there and create some opportunities by hustle, you see it here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4187.627s">Morris,</a>  again, to lean in that time, drawing the contact from Baudette. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4192.33s">You</a>  know and how many times stick to the London coaches are over there saying move your feet. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4195.892s">You</a>  know if Gaskin picks up a foul on the outside with his hands, move your feet, move your feet son.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4201.655s">Two</a>  shots for Kane and Morris.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4204.457s">First</a>  one is no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4207.278s">This</a>  lead is six. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4208.239s">That's</a>  what it was going into the locker room. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4210.2s">So</a>  the London's kind of right of the ship here in the third quarter.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4213.702s">Watching</a>  McKelvin right in front of us trying to run off a little bit of a leg strain. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4217.264s">Sure.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4219.345s">Little</a>  cramp. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4220.508s">Trying</a>  to work that out. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4221.489s">He'd</a>  like to get back on the floor for the fourth quarter, I'm sure. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4225.151s">One</a>  more for Kane and Morris. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4229.273s">That</a>  one's pure. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4230.074s">And</a>  the lead is five. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4233.856s">A</a>  little bit of pressure again here now from West Haven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4243.701s">Here</a>  comes the pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4245.963s">Robinson.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4246.84s">Attacks,</a>  finds Gaskin, Gaskin blocked, gets his own rebound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4251.523s">Kicks</a>  back out, Phillips for three, short. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4254.444s">Westhaven's</a>  gonna run. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4257.025s">Johnson,</a>  wild spin and an offensive foul as Phillips took the charge. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4263.249s">Johnson</a>  was a half beat late on what would have been an exciting spin move.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4267.311s">Yeah,</a>  Phillips holding his ground, missed a three, came back, played D. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4272.361s">stood</a>  his ground, drew the charge, the little things that make big things happen in A.C. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4277.066s">A</a>  little out of control that time by Johnson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4280.61s">Phillips</a>  gets rewarded with a foul called.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4282.792s">Full</a>  time out for New London, so we'll take a quick...

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4342.089s">Well</a>  balanced scoring tonight for New London Casey with you know <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4346.311s">six</a>  players scoring all their points. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4348.433s">Obviously,</a>  Baudette with eight, JJ with six, you've got Jermier Hall with six, you know, and Deshaun Phillips with seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4358.942s">So,</a>  London sharing the basketball out there.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4362.913s">Pressure</a>  again from Westhaven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4365.235s">Last</a>  time the Wailers tried to attack it once it got into Robinson's hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4368.957s">Patience</a>  until then. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4370.258s">Gaskin</a>  finds Robinson, finds Baudette, and that is how you break a press and cause the press to crumble because you get a basket out of it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4380.404s">You</a>  attack it with Robinson and in the back end you get Baudette with ready hands this time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4384.667s">Wailers</a>  now, they're in pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4387.028s">And</a>  they've got Little trapped. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4389.877s">Five</a>  second, double dribble. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4391.677s">Double</a>  dribble from Little. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4393.918s">Whalers</a>  will have the ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4396.198s">Seven</a>  point lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4397.758s">It's,</a>  right now with 54 seconds left, this is a crucial point in the game for West Haven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4402.919s">They're</a>  down seven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4404.14s">They</a>  just have a turnover. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4405.82s">We</a>  only got about two or three possessions left in this quarter.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4409.841s">This</a>  game was tied. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4412.041s">And</a>  they'll want to find a way to get cooking a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4413.901s">They've</a>  extended their lead, believe it or not, here in the third.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4419.883s">What's</a>  the problem here? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4420.603s">We</a>  got a time of official's whistle. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4424.226s">Official's</a>  time out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4425.127s">The</a>  way that Whalers have attacked this pressure the last two times is they've gotten it to Robinson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4429.85s">And</a>  however they did it, either bounce pass to the middle or wing back to the middle. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4433.312s">And</a>  once it's in Robinson's hand, he attacks the basket.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4435.613s">He</a>  attacks, he goes, he draws a lot of attention. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4438.896s">Then</a>  you've got somebody like Bourdette on the backside. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4441.377s">And</a>  it's an easy pitch and catch for two for Jackson Bourdette. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4444.7s">Again,</a>  the key here is- Hold on, hold on.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4446.881s">That</a>  guy right there? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4448.522s">All-time</a>  letter winner, most letters of anybody at New London High School, multiple state championship, Trinity High School, he was all everything at Trinity, and you know what? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4456.067s">He</a>  knows how to use a mop.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4456.928s">He's</a>  setting up his own defense and a mop at the same time.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4458.709s">I</a>  don't care if he's an all-time, I don't care if he's an all-time grade, he knows how to use a mop. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4463.032s">Gets</a>  down to work.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4463.993s">Yeah.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4465.013s">You</a>  know who would never be seen using a mop? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4466.995s">Mike</a>  DeMauro? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4467.775s">No,</a>  me. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4468.716s">Okay.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4470.377s">Me.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4470.597s">You</a>  know, no Swiffers, no mops, nothing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4473.319s">I</a>  mean, you come in for mop-up duty, would you not? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4475.54s">If</a>  you were called in for mop-up duty.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4476.661s">I</a>  could go into mop-up duty, that's right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4480.351s">Teams</a>  down 15 to 4 in the ninth inning. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4482.852s">That's</a>  bringing in Mayday Casey. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4484.573s">Not</a>  Mayday Malone, Mayday Casey.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4485.974s">I</a>  tell you though, the favorite quote of all time. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4488.435s">We</a>  lost in Newington one year. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4490.156s">I</a>  pitched five innings in an exhibition game. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4493.157s">We</a>  beat them in the state tournament like 2 to 1. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4496.479s">And</a>  they said, what's the biggest difference in this team and the team you faced earlier in the season? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4499.241s">And</a>  their head coach without batting an eyelash goes, O'Neal didn't pitch.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4503.703s">All</a>  right, Robinson's been the key to this new London seven-point lead with his ability to attack the pressure, attack the rim, and find open bodies and deliver.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4513.137s">Looks</a>  like they want to use as much clock as they can, limit West Haven to no more than one possession. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4519.918s">Paul</a>  Robinson, Gaskin, Phillips, and Bidette. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4522.94s">13</a>  on the shot clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4524.381s">Robinson</a>  pulls up, zips it underneath to Phillips, but it was a little bit too much of a fastball, and so with 25 on the clock, West Haven can have the last shot of the quarter if they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4536.93s">Down</a>  seven, you would think they would want to limit one shot, no second possession for New London.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4542.414s">One</a>  and done, no run out with seven seconds to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4546.337s">Take</a>  care of the basketball, get a good look,</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4549.177s">That</a>  was a good pass by Robinson, it was just a little bit too much of a fastball for Phillips to handle. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4553.559s">Pressure</a>  by New London. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4556.78s">Open</a>  look, Johnson, corner three, short. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4559.541s">Gaskin,</a>  13 seconds, New London has a chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4562.362s">Gaskin</a>  spins, loses it on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4565.223s">And</a>  with eight seconds remaining now, West Haven right back again will have a chance. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4569.61s">all</a>  the way to the basket and finishing is Tillman, a big basket. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4574.193s">We're</a>  at the end of three and a big basket by Westhaven gets him to within five. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4579.536s">Fourth</a>  quarter action coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4581.217s">You're</a>  watching game day live on the day dot com. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4584.499s">Last</a>  year, Waterford senior number four on the grade eight, the Olympic go kick. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4589.362s">I'm</a>  here with Cam Dickinson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4590.863s">I</a>  don't think she can pull it off. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4592.644s">It</a>  looks way too hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4594.365s">I</a>  think it was a fluke. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4595.745s">Get</a>  it done. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4607.533s">That</a>  was just too easy, and that is a grade eight play. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4610.995s">Send</a>  in your best plays and see if you can beat that and make this year's grade eight Olympico style.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4726.275s">Talking</a>  NBA tonight, I'm all set with that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4728.136s">No,</a>  no, not talking NBA, just referencing the Greek freak, that's all. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4733.598s">Little</a>  misses them both. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4734.539s">The</a>  ball don't lie sometimes. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4735.739s">Game</a>  recognizes game.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4740.424s">And</a>  when you watch Phillips too on his release of his jump shot the last few times in London, a lot of legs involved. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4745.907s">His</a>  shots have been very flat.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4747.548s">Robinson</a>  blocked as he kind of found himself in the danger zone amongst the bigs. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4753.631s">And</a>  Ogletree, literally a tree. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4755.531s">So</a>  he found himself under the, amongst the Ogletrees. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4758.733s">Tall</a>  kid. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4759.934s">Number</a>  three. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4761.454s">Robinson.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4762.735s">And</a>  I'm going to kick ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4767.858s">Do</a>  it a third time here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4771.379s">Trying</a>  to get that ball and a bounce pass to Phillips, which they have right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4782.882s">Swinging</a>  it around now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4785.943s">Stagnant</a>  here on this trip.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4788.144s">They're</a>  kind of back to that perimeter swing. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4790.925s">Nothing</a>  there, nothing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4792.605s">Back</a>  around the perimeter, shot clock to 15. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4796.553s">Now</a>  they're gonna run a play with 12 seconds left. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4798.515s">This</a>  is usually where they find themselves in trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4800.696s">Eight</a>  seconds, Robinson, crossover, pull up, tipped and stolen by Johnson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4808.262s">Over</a>  the top of Phillips, no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4811.284s">Put</a>  back, no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4813.046s">And</a>  Little, working the offensive glass, will go to the line.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4816.817s">And</a>  again, you know, when you're in the fourth quarter, the wasted offensive trips, you know, like that one for New London, you know, you didn't get a shot off there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4823.98s">And</a>  Robinson turned the corner, decided to kick it out, balls turned over, and an easy opportunity comes down for West Haven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4831.043s">But</a>  you've got to find a way to get at least a quality shot in the half court set. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4836.285s">Foul</a>  was on Padet.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4838.746s">Little</a>  will shoot two. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4841.227s">First</a>  one is good.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4846.025s">It's</a>  a juncture of the game, Casey, where you work so hard in that third quarter to build that seven point lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4851.866s">You</a>  don't want to let West Haven back in the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4853.986s">At</a>  least hold serve, hold court.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4857.287s">Two</a>  free throws by Morris are good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4863.308s">Substitutions</a>  coming in the game for West Haven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4866.169s">3-0</a>  run to start the third quarter. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4872.55s">Ball</a>  from the free throw line. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4874.904s">So</a>  the fouls on Baudette, I don't know if that's two or three on Baudette. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4880.828s">Robinson.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4885.332s">McKelvin</a>  now, squares up, looks for a cutter, back to Phillips. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4890.017s">Robinson,</a>  harassed, drives baseline, floats, hangs, no. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4895.458s">McKelvin</a>  gets the offensive rebound and it's knocked out of bounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4899.079s">Robinson</a>  went hard. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4901.04s">Only</a>  one foul on Baudette, so I thought they had, I thought I was worried about it being three or four and it was only one. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4906.081s">So,</a>  lots of worry about nothing. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4910.442s">Some</a>  more mopping on the floor as it's getting a little wet down there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4915.556s">Whalers</a>  caught a break there McKelvin had it knocked out of his hands timeout.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4919.817s">That's</a>  a good timeout by coach Dave right there the offense is kind of sputtered the last two or three downs down the court talk things over set up an inbound piece you know and go from there right now Robinson seems to be the only the only aggressive piece on the offensive end you know start the fourth quarter for New London.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4936.442s">The</a>  problem with this with what if <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4938.683s">If</a>  they get to about 10 seconds on the shot clock, they don't have anything to that they can do other than sort of the reckless drive to the basket. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4946.828s">So</a>  they really, if they don't get a shot off and a good look by about the 15 second mark, then their offense becomes one dimensional and not something that West Haven really worries about because they've got the size and length. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4960.396s">So</a>  you watch the Whalers start to move and you can tell at about 25 seconds, <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4964.738s">Is</a>  this going to be a swing around the perimeter possession or a hero basketball move and that's what so you know they've got to get the ball at the 25 second mark into the paint or to the cutter. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4975.725s">If</a>  they're just going to go around the perimeter at 25 seconds then they look up and there's 15 and they got they got to start going and then they're at a you know they got nothing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4983.09s">The</a>  offense breaks down the quality becomes less than what coach Dave Cornish would want to see. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4988.213s">That</a>  is correct.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4989.454s">So</a>  Robinson will inbound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4993.245s">Kanan</a>  Morris who's done a great job for the Blue Devils on him. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4996.648s">Bedette</a>  flashes, catches it high. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=4998.651s">And</a>  he's harassed and we're gonna get a foul on Ogletree.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5002.514s">Ogletree</a>  doesn't like it, that's a good call. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5005.137s">Grabbing</a>  the back of his wrist, holding the ball high. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5009.582s">The</a>  double team is definitely coming when he touches the basketball.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5018.243s">Inbound</a>  McKelvin, stolen. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5020.404s">That</a>  was good hands from Johnson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5022.445s">They</a>  almost turned it over, but Tillman, so quick to the basketball. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5032.109s">Tillman</a>  with Hall on him. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5033.27s">Oh,</a>  hanging in the air with a left hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5038.772s">Jakai</a>  Little, and the lead is one. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5041.573s">Timeout.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5043.354s">Ty</a>  Sullivan, because they want to set up pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5045.695s">It's</a>  a 6-0 run.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5047.85s">to</a>  start the fourth quarter for West Haven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5051.611s">And</a>  you know, right now, New London is just floundering on the offensive end. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5056.451s">And</a>  much like the start of the third quarter, KC West Haven kind of comes out, they impose their will on the defensive end, and they get some easy buckets on the other side. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5064.693s">They've</a>  got four points from the free throw line, and then one made layup. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5067.433s">That's</a>  their point so far in the fourth quarter.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5069.154s">And</a>  New London hasn't gotten a reasonable shot in this quarter, because they've been sort of relegated to the perimeter, where New London took off <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5078.13s">was</a>  when they were breaking pressure and getting layups, or when they had Robinson attack the middle and find his teammates. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5085.56s">Right</a>  now, New London is out of sync, out of sorts, and out of time here with a one-point lead for them to figure out how to run their offense.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5094.121s">You</a>  know, who's gonna step up and be that next player? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5097.182s">I</a>  mean, you know, Hall hasn't had any good looks. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5100.484s">You</a>  know, I guess I'm still waiting for Phillips to kind of step up and put his stamp on this game as a senior in the last six minutes. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5107.567s">Obviously</a>  Robinson, very aggressive. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5109.828s">You</a>  know, Bourdette's out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5111.229s">Let's</a>  just make things easy for ourselves on the offensive end. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5114.811s">Stay</a>  aggressive, move the basketball. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5121.208s">We've</a>  seen this, though, a few different times in the London team, where they kind of build a little bit of a lead for themselves and fall asleep. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5127.313s">Then</a>  have to climb back up and take another four or five point lead and kind of hang on a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5132.397s">It's</a>  a good West Haven team.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5133.799s">Very</a>  good West Haven team. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5135.16s">They</a>  will drop out of pressure off the timeout, which I wouldn't be pressuring New London either, because that's the easy way to give them on offense.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5143.327s">Warren</a>  back into the game for Hall.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5145.308s">Original</a>  starting five in the game now for the Whalers. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5148.851s">Warren.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5150.01s">dumps</a>  down to Baudette. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5151.23s">He's</a>  doubled and he's tied up and the possession arrow favors West Haven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5156.452s">So</a>  that's the one problem. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5157.593s">That's</a>  what they want. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5158.393s">They</a>  want to get the dump down so that they can double Baudette.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5161.654s">Baudette</a>  is telling them I don't I don't need the basketball right there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5164.275s">Put</a>  it up high where I can grab it and turn and face the bounce pass is no good.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5169.857s">Again</a>  they were letting Warren they had said please shoot the three. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5176.82s">Spot</a>  up wide open three no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5180.493s">That</a>  was Morris, now Robinson with the basketball. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5182.935s">Robinson</a>  hangs, finds Padet, soft touch, lead is 3.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5187.1s">Yeah,</a>  good recognition that time by Robinson, noticing the big man out in front. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5191.304s">And</a>  Padet with 12 to lead the way for the Whalers.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5194.887s">That's</a>  when they're at their best. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5196.008s">That's</a>  a big bucket too. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5197.229s">Yeah,</a>  when Robinson distributes and Padet finishes, that's when they're at their best. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5202.583s">Around</a>  the curl, Johnson, he's been very hot. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5205.504s">Not</a>  that time, however, as that goes out of bounds, and it'll be Whaler basketball.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5210.786s">Boy,</a>  you're so right about Robinson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5212.306s">When</a>  he gets himself freewheeling, nobody around him, he can survey the floor a little bit, you know, and you've gotta be ready. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5219.509s">You've</a>  gotta make yourself available, whether you're, you know, McKelvin Jr., or Jackson Bourdette, or even Savon Warren. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5226.071s">Just</a>  be ready for the basketball, because, you know, if you're open, he's gonna get it to you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5234.513s">Warren,</a>  that ball is tipped. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5236.557s">Stolen</a>  by Morris. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5238.661s">And</a>  a laziness, the lazy passes. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5243.457s">Steal</a>  the other direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5244.898s">Phillips</a>  goes to the left hand. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5247.619s">Tipped</a>  out of bounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5249.06s">Wildly</a>  flung in. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5250.22s">Robinson</a>  gets it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5251.701s">He</a>  finds Warren, but it's on the floor. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5253.242s">And</a>  Warren wisely pulls it out. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5255.443s">Instead,</a>  floats. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5257.204s">No</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5257.924s">Tipped.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5258.625s">No</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5259.645s">Who's</a>  going to come down with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5261.446s">It's</a>  going to be Johnson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5263.387s">Big</a>  defensive rebound for West Haven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5267.889s">Man,</a>  if New London could finish around the back.</p>

    <p>[Unidentified]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5269.59s">Just</a>  make a layup.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5270.251s">My</a>  goodness.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5282.067s">Bellamy</a>  Tillman rather Tillman step back three no good offensive rebound Ogletree and they're going to have a foul. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5292.831s">It's</a>  like Warren peeking in from the outside region. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5296.192s">It</a>  is going to be on Warren. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5298.158s">And</a>  that's going to put Ogletree at the line to shoot two and Ogletree's length has definitely bothered New London. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5304.805s">He</a>  has been in for Roman for a while now and Ogletree has been their main guy on the glass.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5309.209s">Got</a>  to find a body on the bigs. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5311.652s">Got</a>  to keep him off the glass on the offensive end.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5316.717s">One</a>  of the knocks on New London, the whispers around the league was <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5322.314s">They</a>  can't win the close game. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5323.794s">If</a>  you get them in a close one, they don't know how to finish.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5326.635s">That's</a>  been Dave's M.O. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5328.136s">for</a>  a long time, even using the ledger. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5330.137s">You</a>  know, how do you, how do you close out somebody's close game, situational basketball?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5334.478s">They</a>  said if they get a lead, they can run away with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5336.739s">They</a>  can, they can bury it.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5337.839s">Right.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5338.179s">But</a>  if you keep yourself in a close one, if you keep yourself in a close one, you know, that Crosby game was close late, but they pulled away. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5343.781s">Yeah.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5344.281s">You</a>  know, can they win a game when it's a one possession game, you know, under a minute? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5349.545s">We're</a>  going to find out because I don't think West Haven's going anywhere here in these last four minutes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5356.47s">And</a>  they're packing it in West Haven too. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5359.912s">Again,</a>  challenging the one in the shoot to three.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5364.395s">Hall</a>  now Robinson looking for a high screen from Bidette gets the mismatch, but we're down to 10 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5370.219s">Robinson.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5372.102s">This</a>  is the same thing before, Robinson gets a screen, drives, floats, left hand, it's blocked by Johnson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5380.048s">And</a>  we're going to get a foul, I think on McKelvin on the push.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5385.132s">Yep,</a>  foul's on McKelvin. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5386.653s">And</a>  that wild circus shot came with two seconds on the shot clock.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5392.238s">Again,</a>  they cannot run an offense with ten seconds left on the shot clock.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5403.104s">London</a>  with only two points this quarter they led 39-32 coming into the fourth.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5410.669s">West</a>  Haven with a chance to tie or take the lead and that would be interesting if they ever took the lead what does new how does New London respond you know they haven't lost the lead yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5424.798s">No</a>  good tipped keeping it alive. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5428.812s">was</a>  little, little, kick out, wide open, three is up, no good, weak side, Phillips, he's ahead, he's got numbers. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5437.436s">Blocked</a>  by Morris, now Westhaven the other direction. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5443.859s">A</a>  charge, nice job by Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5445.92s">Offensive</a>  foul as Jameer Hall stood his ground and took the charge from Morris and that is the second time Hall has done that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5458.033s">Taking</a>  one for the team is a new definition on that one, my friend. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5462.336s">Holding</a>  your ground, absorbing the blow. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5464.138s">And</a>  again, Phillips that time with numbers, Casey, and kind of indecisive with the basketball. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5471.643s">And</a>  what is he going to do with it? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5472.664s">I</a>  mean, if you're three steps from the rim, drive over to the rim and finish.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5477.147s">And</a>  they're making a priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5478.368s">I</a>  mean, they're guarding Phillips from the jump. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5480.75s">They're</a>  making a priority of him. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5483.831s">New</a>  London's got to find a way to get an offense going here and not just pass the ball around the perimeter they're just they're playing shot clock basketball right now.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5492.157s">Gotta</a>  stay aggressive high ball screen here from Burdett the double team comes.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5496.42s">And</a>  we're gonna get a foul. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5501.895s">foul</a>  on Ogletree. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5502.735s">On</a>  Ogletree, which I think is a break for Robinson because they had him in a dangerous spot as well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5507.417s">He's</a>  right on half court. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5508.617s">The</a>  double team comes a little too greedy that time with the hands by Tyrone Ogletree. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5520.762s">It's</a>  five on Ogletree, he's fouled out.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5522.622s">Ogletree</a>  fouls out of the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5525.003s">Roman</a>  coming back into the game is no picnic with Ogletree going away.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5528.524s">Roman's</a>  been incredibly active. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5529.345s">Length</a>  comes back with Length.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5531.929s">But</a>  the Whalers need to find a way to get I mean I don't like this sitting outside and letting 30 seconds go up the shot I mean that's just that's ridiculous.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5539.296s">They</a>  got to run an offense. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5540.478s">Robinson's</a>  kind of fiddling and diddling but doing nothing with the basketball at the top of the circle.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5546.203s">I</a>  think they were saying it wasn't on Ogletree and they're trying to get Ogletree to fit the foul switched off of Ogletree. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5551.849s">You</a>  see Kevin Kobelski the outstanding official talking to West Haven.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5558.017s">Look</a>  at some fans, security's looking at some fans over there behind the bench. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5566.6s">That's</a>  what's going on there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5569.02s">Four</a>  fouls for New London and three for West Haven.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5576.063s">So</a>  New London will inbound, Hall far away from us on the far court. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5583.345s">Robinson</a>  out. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5590.927s">Hall,</a>  open three, third one of the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5594.528s">Oh,</a>  Jameer Hall, shooter's gonna shoot. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5597.85s">I</a>  see you, Jameer Hall.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5602.031s">Big</a>  time shot from the junior.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5610.735s">Step</a>  in, jump shot, no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5614.856s">And</a>  Bidet knocks it out of bounds.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5617.697s">I</a>  like the way Hall works on the baseline, frees himself up, nails it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5623.782s">Huge</a>  shot. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5624.803s">A</a>  little breathing room for New London with under two to go.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5629.407s">Yeah,</a>  it's like breathing room on a cold day with asthma. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5637.314s">Up</a>  top, Tillman. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5639.096s">Tillman.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5644.795s">West</a>  Haven taking some time they're gonna be methodical they need a basket which means they need a good look. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5650.778s">Open</a>  look, three, no good from Morris. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5654.999s">Offensive</a>  rebound and a foul. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5657.7s">Offensive</a>  rebound came down to Johnson and that'll put him at the line to shoot two and he's a good shooter.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5663.001s">You've</a>  got to find a way in these long three point shots if you're in London to find the glass. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5668.923s">I</a>  mean long shots, long rebounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5671.163s">Box</a>  out on the shooter, all five guys with their faces in the glass. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5676.084s">You've</a>  got to take care of the basketball on the defensive end.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5681.968s">Two</a>  shots for Aaron Johnson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5683.509s">He's</a>  been an excellent shooter for them all night long. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5688.83s">And</a>  he, oh, that one was, that one was in the net and it came out the other way. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5702.175s">One</a>  more for Johnson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5704.229s">We</a>  said Little, see Little has the friendly rim rolls all night. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5707.61s">Johnson,</a>  the ugly rim that time. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5710.851s">Good</a>  basketball game here tonight, huh? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5712.811s">One</a>  of two, four, now Westhaven's gonna pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5715.472s">Now</a>  this is where New London has a chance to use this pressure as an opportunity to score. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5721.373s">Robinson</a>  breaks the pressure, attacks the basket. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5725.154s">Off</a>  him, great weak side help, and the block.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5729.64s">And</a>  it'll be West Haven ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5731.261s">Get</a>  to the rim, maybe a ball fake or something like that if you're Robinson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5734.823s">You're</a>  kind of in no man's land a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5737.645s">Bounce</a>  pass on the backside, maybe to Bourdette. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5743.109s">Easy</a>  to say when I'm not out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5744.47s">When</a>  you have a head of steam, you just want to go.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5746.871s">This</a>  is what we said. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5747.972s">Can</a>  New London find a way to close out this close game? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5751.534s">Time</a>  out, West Haven.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5758.088s">The</a>  brain trust over there for New London. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5760.009s">He's</a>  got a great staff Casey. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5762.471s">You</a>  know whether it's Troy McKelvin or Danny Spellman and it's just a lot of good basketball minds around him. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5771.418s">Dave</a>  Cornish does.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5772.579s">Here's</a>  the order of things for the Whalers. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5775.481s">Sound</a>  defensive effort. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5778.043s">Rebound.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5778.863s">Yes.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5779.644s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5780.505s">Regardless</a>  of whether you make or miss you're going to have the lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5785.57s">So</a>  if it's you have a four point lead with the ball then you know now you got to possess the ball. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5791.251s">All</a>  right. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5791.491s">Be</a>  smart with it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5792.572s">They're</a>  going to pressure you if you have a two point lead or a one point lead. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5797.113s">They're</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5797.893s">They</a>  may not pressure you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5798.933s">They</a>  may choose to play shot clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5800.713s">But</a>  what New London absolutely has to do first is sound defense and rebound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5806.155s">Take</a>  care of the best. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5806.795s">No</a>  more second chances. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5808.175s">West</a>  Haven is in a fascinating spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5811.436s">I</a>  think they go for a two. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5813.707s">And</a>  then, I don't think they're gonna pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5816.188s">I</a>  think they're gonna drop back, because they all have a full shot clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5819.529s">I</a>  would make New London try to score. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5823.77s">If</a>  you play that out, it's still a three possession game. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5826.131s">What</a>  New London cannot do here is give up an open look three. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5830.332s">If</a>  West Haven's gonna score, you gotta make them get it in the basket area. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5840.435s">Tillman,</a>  the senior guard. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5844.835s">swing</a>  they'll give that shot he wanted it instead wild shot no good and Warren tipped it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5859.064s">Cornish</a>  will call a timeout with 1-12.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5863.586s">Part</a>  one yes defend the rim rebound take care of the basketball settle things down things a little unrest out there coach Cornish wants to call timeout. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5872.712s">Now</a>  with a</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5879.003s">So</a>  Griswold, who has down 10 at the end of three, has cut it to one in the final seconds of their quarterfinal game. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5886.55s">That</a>  would be their semifinal game coming up. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5888.852s">They</a>  make the semifinals. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5889.993s">It's</a>  their quarterfinal game. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5890.914s">I'm</a>  out of sorts now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5892.675s">You</a>  know why? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5892.996s">Because</a>  I was ready to explain a point to you.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5894.697s">No,</a>  I got you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5895.137s">I</a>  understand. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5895.758s">Or</a>  the audience. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5896.859s">I</a>  know the points. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5897.6s">Explain</a>  to the audience.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5899.201s">Four</a>  is a huge number. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5901.203s">It's</a>  a two possession game. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5902.004s">Yes,</a>  it is. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5902.902s">So</a>  I think West Haven is going to try to pressure and trap. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5907.104s">And</a>  then I think they got a foul, because I don't think they can be down four with 30 seconds left or 40 seconds left in the game.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5915.989s">Still</a>  one to give.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5917.19s">Right.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5917.43s">So</a>  I think you're going to see pressure, and then the foul. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5922.933s">They</a>  can't give up the layup. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5924.653s">What'll</a>  be interesting is if New London gets the layup, <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5928.441s">Do</a>  they take it, or do they try to run the entire clock?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5931.602s">Oh,</a>  I would attack it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5932.463s">I</a>  would attack it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5933.083s">If</a>  it's giving you there, and you've got numbers, and you beat the pressure, I would attack the rim. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5939.786s">I</a>  mean, New London, Casey, you know, I mean, and Coach Cornish and his teams, I mean, they don't do very well with the game in a cooler. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5946.968s">You</a>  know, I mean, they're better once you beat that pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5949.729s">If</a>  you can go get the rim with Phillips, you can go get the rim with Robinson, go get it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5955.647s">It's</a>  always been Dave style of play.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5957.708s">Four</a>  guards, well three guards McKelvin and Baudette. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5961.53s">Hall</a>  passes it off to Robinson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5966.112s">Robinson</a>  breaks pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5969.114s">Here</a>  comes the double team. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5970.915s">Robinson</a>  nifty with the basketball. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5973.736s">They</a>  haven't fouled them yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5974.917s">There</a>  comes another double and there's the foul. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5977.615s">Good</a>  job because that foul resets the shot clock and it's only the fourth. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5982.718s">So</a>  now New London, now they have to come out and foul New London with 35 seconds on the shot clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5989.402s">So</a>  get it into a free throw shooter's hands here. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5993.864s">Which</a>  I think they're gonna try to get it to Robinson or Phillips. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=5996.045s">And</a>  a double's coming. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6005.33s">Robinson</a>  will inbound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6009.225s">And</a>  a timeout, Whalers, as the immediate pass was not there on the inbound.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6018.35s">Good</a>  ballgame here at New London High School, the way it should be. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6021.471s">Four</a>  to final action.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6026.42s">Ladies</a>  and gentlemen, the Griswold Wolverines have punched their ticket to the semifinals with a buzzer beater. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6034.149s">A</a>  buzzer beating win for the Griswold Wolverines. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6037.393s">The</a>  division two champions of the ECC are in the semifinals of division four. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6043.901s">Congratulations.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6046.272s">Wow,</a>  we've got teams all over the place in the semifinals right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6050.895s">This</a>  league has fared extremely well.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6054.036s">I</a>  want to put it in perspective, if New London can hold on. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6057.251s">There's</a>  St. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6058.391s">Bernard's</a>  in the Division 1 semis. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6060.452s">There</a>  would be New London and NFA playing each other in the Division 2 semis, guaranteeing a final spot. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6065.614s">There</a>  would be Fitch in the Division 3 semis, Grizzled in the Division 4 semis, and Old Lime and Grasso Tech, who are ECC adjacent. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6073.017s">They're</a>  local teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6074.337s">They</a>  are game day teams. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6076.218s">They're</a>  in a semifinal already, guaranteeing a final. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6079.772s">And</a>  the girls we already said have three or four in class M. The ECC has acquitted itself well, but New London has to hold on here to guarantee that semifinal benefit.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6088.617s">Finish</a>  the job if you're New London. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6090.178s">Good</a>  time out by Robinson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6091.719s">A</a>  little out of sorts on the inbounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6094.52s">Talk</a>  it over. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6095.14s">A</a>  little different look this time on the inbounds for New London.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6098.762s">They're</a>  going to give Bidet available for a lob as well as the bigger screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6104.926s">The</a>  little screen from Hall didn't free anybody up. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6107.367s">So</a>  there's Bidet with a bigger screen. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6109.277s">And</a>  they go long to Hall. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6112.439s">Here</a>  comes the pressure. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6113.299s">Pick</a>  the dribble up. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6114.4s">And</a>  a steal. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6115.1s">No</a>  man's land. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6117.742s">And</a>  they're going to get a foul on the perimeter, which will give two shots to West Haven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6124.585s">And</a>  if they can make both and pressure, it brings it down to a one point game. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6128.027s">And</a>  they no longer have to foul.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6129.608s">God,</a>  I think I want the ball in Robinson's hand on the inbounds or Phillips. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6134.831s">Maybe</a>  have Hall be the trigger man. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6136.792s">Get</a>  JJ the rock. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6137.892s">Let</a>  him do his thing.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6139.533s">Ja'Kai</a>  Little, sophomore from West Haven will shoot two. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6143.076s">Now,</a>  New England's got a rebound too off this second one if West Haven puts anybody in. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6147.88s">I</a>  think they're going to set up pressure and not try for the offensive rebound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6152.385s">First</a>  one no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6153.786s">Guarantees</a>  that it remains the full one possession.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6159.291s">Such</a>  a huge miss at this juncture of the game, 48 seconds left to go. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6164.596s">Morris</a>  has had a, I'm sorry, Littles had a fantastic ball game.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6168.737s">Misses</a>  them both. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6169.998s">McKelvin</a>  with the rebound, he's tied up. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6173.378s">Possession</a>  arrow favors New London. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6176.939s">But</a>  a big tie up for Westhaven because it flips the script, flips the arrow. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6181.921s">Who</a>  wants to win the game, that's what it's about right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6185.622s">45</a>  seconds for point eight, it is winning time. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6192.504s">McKelvin</a>  to inbound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6194.495s">Baudette,</a>  long pass, tipped. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6200.457s">Swinging</a>  it around, three pointer up, no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6203.838s">Offensive</a>  rebound, step in, another three from Little, is good! <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6210.219s">44-43</a>  and it's a one point game.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6215.121s">London</a>  doing everything in their power to give this game away in the last 30 seconds. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6220.938s">Wow.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6222.439s">Second,</a>  third chance scoring opportunities off the inbounds. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6226.441s">Off</a>  the turnover. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6227.421s">West</a>  Haven sticking to it, Casey.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6230.543s">The</a>  sophomore missed both free throws. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6233.124s">No</a>  bigger shot in the game than that one. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6235.865s">Dramatically</a>  alters all of the strategy. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6238.967s">And</a>  give credit to Tillman for finding the open man. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6242.869s">Because</a>  now, it is a, not only is it a one possession game, it is a one possession game where you cannot <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6250.312s">be</a>  put into two possessions if you foul. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6252.756s">So,</a>  New London will be in the bonus. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6255.019s">I</a>  mean, it's gonna be interesting what West Haven does. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6258.224s">Obviously,</a>  they're gonna have to foul if they can't get the turnover. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6261.188s">Alright,</a>  so they're gonna have to put someone at the line. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6264.293s">But</a>  New London's gotta break pressure first. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6266.808s">And</a>  they have not done that yet.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6267.848s">Well,</a>  I was going to show you get the ball across half court right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6270.129s">I</a>  mean, it's struggled the last two or three times inbound the basketball twice here on the side. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6274.909s">And</a>  then once there on the off the miss.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6277.57s">But</a>  that tried the cross court pass that against nine teams out of 10 is successful. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6283.391s">But</a>  the length of West Haven is unique that way. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6286.512s">And</a>  that ball was tipped. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6287.852s">It</a>  wouldn't have been. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6288.472s">There's</a>  no other team that would have tipped that ball.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6290.192s">That</a>  was like you said, Ogletree fouled out. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6291.692s">Roman</a>  comes in. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6292.413s">Roman's</a>  got the length. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6293.593s">You</a>  lose nothing there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6298.338s">There's</a>  a wire job here.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6301.959s">And</a>  if I were Dave Cornish, my stomach is in Rolaids, Pepsi. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6309.442s">I</a>  got a little Zantac action.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6321.066s">The</a>  coach is on the floor, huh? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6325.907s">But</a>  they put three minutes back on the clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6327.368s">What</a>  happened here? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6330.999s">can't</a>  be right.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6335.003s">28.7</a>  seconds should be the time. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6338.707s">I</a>  don't I hope they I don't know if they know that because the clock says three minutes right now now it's 301. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6342.571s">Are</a>  they gonna keep the time on the floor what are they gonna do? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6349.317s">They're</a>  working it's at 30 seconds now they're working it down to the to the way <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6356.691s">30</a>  seconds on the clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6357.732s">Okay</a>  30 seconds is what they put back on the clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6359.773s">Yeah</a>  so they went to three minutes so they could move the decimal over. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6365.677s">30</a>  seconds McKelvin will inbound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6371.021s">I</a>  think they're trying to work it out right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6373.122s">I</a>  don't know that they can get it to 29.8 unless they do it manually.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6376.965s">28.7</a>  is what Mike DeMauro had.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6410.158s">He's</a>  showing a ref his arm. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6413.091s">You've</a>  got to think right now, as an official, if the kid's getting bumped, there's an effort to foul. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6420.633s">Roman</a>  back into the game.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6421.573s">16</a>  seconds right now. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6424.014s">New</a>  London's got to inbound it, and then not just possess it and allow the double to come, because the possession arrow favors West Haven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6430.816s">They've</a>  got to inbound it and get it into a place where they can get fouled. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6435.437s">So</a>  they've got to try to inbound it long here, I think. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6442.957s">They're</a>  giving the inbound to Bidette, now they're not. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6451.581s">Robinson,</a>  inbound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6455.743s">And</a>  we got a foul on the floor against Roman. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6462.986s">And</a>  so that'll put New London at the line to shoot two. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6466.278s">No</a>  bigger free throws here because great job by Westhaven no time comes off the clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6472.82s">It</a>  means Westhaven is going to have 16 seconds to tie or win this game depending on the free throws from Troy McKelvin Jr.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6485.985s">Big</a>  shots for a sophomore. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6488.246s">Man</a>  my heart is. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6489.006s">Yeah</a>  it's what a basketball game.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6494.853s">It'll</a>  be interesting if New London misses, if they pressure at all, or if they're going to run, you know, get back in the gate. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6504.018s">16</a>  seconds remaining, two for McKelvin. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6518.146s">First</a>  one is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6520.847s">This</a>  one's big, partner. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6522.008s">He</a>  makes this one, it guarantees <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6526.238s">They</a>  can't lose on a regulation shot without something funky happening. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6531.379s">Warren</a>  checks into the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6534.059s">If</a>  he misses, West Haven can tie or win on a buzzer beat. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6551.003s">One</a>  more for Troy McKelvin Jr. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6559.856s">It</a>  is up, and it is good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6561.417s">Whalers</a>  by three. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6563.498s">16</a>  seconds remaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6564.859s">Tillman</a>  with the basketball, Robinson on him. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6567.801s">Westhaven</a>  needs a three-two tie. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6575.806s">No</a>  good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6576.967s">Bidet</a>  with a foul. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6579.308s">So</a>  with 1.7 remaining, Westhaven will go to the line to shoot two, but they're gonna have to miss the second one.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6587.646s">Yeah,</a>  try to make the first one, miss the second one.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6595.37s">Whalers</a>  had a chance, if they could've secured that rebound, we'd be done. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6601.073s">So</a>  back to the line, Ja'Kai Little, who made the big three, but missed two free throws earlier. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6607.776s">No</a>  two free throws bigger than this one, he's gonna have to make the first one and miss the second. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6621.56s">Little</a>  at the line with big free throws. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6628.303s">First</a>  one rattles home. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6634.566s">Philistin</a>  into the game, they're gonna put maximum size as they know Little has to try to intentionally miss the free throw. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6643.85s">Westhaven</a>  down two, 1.7. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6648.362s">Ja'Kai</a>  Little, the sophomore, needs the miss. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6653.363s">The</a>  Blue Devils need the rebound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6662.385s">The</a>  miss. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6664.885s">And</a>  a lane violation, it looks like, against West Haven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6668.786s">No</a>  shot, 1.7, Whalers will inbound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6678.274s">McKelvin</a>  will inbound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6679.815s">They</a>  can throw it long with 1.7. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6684.217s">They</a>  have to get this inbounds, however. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6694.303s">Here</a>  we go. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6696.504s">1.7</a>  away from a semifinal trip to take on conference rival NFA. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6712.813s">And</a>  the officials are talking it over. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6721.759s">And</a>  I don't know what's going on. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6724.22s">More</a>  problems with the crowd, it looks like. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6734.727s">Looks</a>  like they're escorting some folks out of the building. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6737.488s">McKelvin</a>  will inbound with 1.7 remaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6741.195s">Here</a>  we go, can the Wailers punch their ticket to the semifinal against NFA? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6756.148s">And</a>  they're sending both teams back to their benches until we can figure this out. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6762.338s">While</a>  they figure this out, we're going to take a quick break. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6764.239s">We'll</a>  be right back. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6765.179s">You're</a>  watching Game Day live on the Day.com. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6767.199s">Game</a>  Day is brought to you by Waterford Dental Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6770.76s">Gear</a>  up for Game Day with a winning smile from Waterford Dental Health. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6774.981s">Located</a>  in Waterford, we're your go-to for top-notch dental care in a relaxed, friendly setting. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6780.263s">Whether</a>  you need a routine checkup, a cosmetic boost or advanced treatment, our experienced team has you covered. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6786.124s">Enjoy</a>  the game with confidence and comfort. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6788.505s">Schedule</a>  your appointment today. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6790.146s">Waterford</a>  Dental Health, where your smile is our top priority. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6793.686s">Visit</a>  us online or call now to book. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6800.068s">1.7</a>  seconds remaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6801.228s">Whalers</a>  have the basketball. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6802.809s">They</a>  merely need to inbound and maintain possession. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6809.45s">Westhaven's</a>  gonna have to try to foul. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6817.186s">Mike</a>  what was going on that was causing the delay? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6823.453s">They're</a>  checking the book to see if the kid's foul right there was his fourth or his fifth. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6829.018s">Alright</a>  so they're working to find out if the foul that occurred on the after the miss was his fourth or his fifth. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6835.185s">It</a>  appears that they have it all figured out and maybe we can finish this thing here finally. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6845.786s">So</a>  McKelvin to inbound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6849.308s">And</a>  I guess that was his fifth because coming into the game is Justice Richardson. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6861.235s">A</a>  lot to go through, a lot of time here to try to get this inbound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6865.017s">McKelvin</a>  will do it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6865.958s">He</a>  can throw it long and risk the pick off. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6869.74s">He</a>  does, up in the air it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6872.621s">Good</a>  if it goes. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6875.992s">but</a>  a travel beforehand, and that's gonna be your ballgame. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6880.234s">The</a>  New London High School Whalers. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6883.115s">Barring,</a>  if the officials don't put time back on the clock, the travel ends it, and the Whalers have punched their ticket to the semifinals, where they'll take on NFA. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6898.162s">Unless,</a>  of course, they put time back on the clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6902.144s">If</a>  they do, <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6903.825s">New</a>  London simply needs to inbound it again. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6907.967s">We'll</a>  find out here in a moment. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6926.955s">We're</a>  gonna wait for the official, official, official, but it appears like they're saying time is done. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6940.85s">Or</a>  not, because the players haven't left the floor yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6949.256s">Looks</a>  like they're putting time back on the clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6951.298s">0.7</a>  being put back on the clock. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6962.473s">So</a>  the Whalers simply need to inbound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6964.434s">Technically</a>  .7 is not enough to catch, turn and shoot. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6968.515s">So</a>  all they have to do is inbound it deep enough and this game will be over. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6979.338s">How</a>  do you turn 1.7 seconds into 25 minutes? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6981.418s">This</a>  is how. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6994.556s">So</a>  1.7 seconds remaining. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=6998.378s">As</a>  soon as they allow the inbounds to happen, the Whalers simply need to have someone touch it and the clock should run out. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7008.842s">So</a>  McKelvin will inbound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7016.725s">McKelvin</a>  will inbound it right in front of his bench. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7022.527s">Again,</a>  shouldn't be enough time for a catch and shoot, so all it needs to be is touched and not shot towards the basket. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7042.021s">I</a>  have no idea what just happened. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7044.883s">Turnover,</a>  yes, because McKelvin threw it off his man, off the Blue Devil, but I don't understand why <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7057.078s">So</a>  now that does allow a lob. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7059.419s">We're</a>  not done yet. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7068.083s">West</a>  Haven can get a lob. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7075.566s">And</a>  if West Haven finds a way to tie this game, this place will literally come undone. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7082.629s">Not</a>  the building, but the people within it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7089.711s">So</a>  they're gonna put Baudette on the basketball. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7095.494s">And</a>  everyone else has to guard. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7096.874s">It</a>  should only be a tap, it should not be able to be a catch and shoot. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7105.279s">Bellamy</a>  inbounds for Westhaven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7111.962s">Now</a>  Tillman will inbound for Westhaven. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7118.787s">This</a>  is like the Hail Mary in football. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7120.968s">If</a>  you're new London, just knock it down. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7123.469s">Knock</a>  it away. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7126.51s">Tillman,</a>  inbound. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7129.351s">Shot</a>  is up, it's no good. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7131.572s">The</a>  Wailers have held on in an incredibly weird, ugly, and sloppy finish. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7138.795s">But</a>  46-44, they are going to the semifinals to take on NFA on Tuesday, which means <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7149.255s">St.</a>  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7149.495s">Bernard's</a>  is in the division one semis. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7151.957s">New</a>  London and NFA are in the division two semis. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7155.479s">Fitch</a>  is in the division three semis. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7158.0s">Griswold</a>  is in the division four semis. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7162.09s">Stonington,</a>  Windham, and Bacon Academy girls are in the class M semis. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7166.973s">And</a>  Grasso Tech and Old Lime are in the division five semis. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7170.836s">A</a>  lot of ECC teams and a lot of locals looking to punch tickets come Monday and Tuesday, but we are guaranteed an ECC team in the division two finals and in the class M finals. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7183.244s">An</a>  outstanding, outstanding effort from the ECC. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7186.866s">The</a>  Sports Doctor. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7187.987s">We'll</a>  have the Roberto's Log Cabin player of the game day, as well as coach Dave Cornish. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7193.952s">Of</a>  course, Roberto's our longtime sponsor. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7197.455s">They</a>  are located in the woods of Lebanon. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7199.877s">The</a>  Log Cabin, family owned and operated. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7202.058s">They</a>  got great menu, wings. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7204.18s">They</a>  got a great bar, great drinks. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7205.781s">Go</a>  see Rob and his crew. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7207.723s">Let</a>  them know that game day sent you. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7210.125s">You</a>  definitely will not go wrong eating at Roberto's Log Cabin. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7213.408s">So</a>  the sports doctor has our player of the game day and coach Cornish, sports doctor.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7245.331s">Now,</a>  these games aren't easy, are they? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7246.971s">And</a>  it takes a team effort out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7248.692s">When</a>  things got hard and you had to rise up and hit that big three, was there no thinking involved, just catch and shoot or what?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_01]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7255.078s">No</a>  thinking, you can't think, you gotta just let it go. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7257.22s">We</a>  practice hard every day, we gotta go in there, we get our reps in. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7260.483s">I</a>  trust myself, come on.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7261.744s">Yeah,</a>  great job out there tonight, I don't know if you know or not, but NFA has won on the other side, so you're gonna see them for the fourth time this year. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7268.49s">Altona</a>  fan Jeff Brown we on the way, but I said all right coach Coach coach. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7274.534s">How</a>  did you guys find a way to win this game with always going seven points in the fourth quarter?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7278.977s">defense</a>  Defense that was it. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7281.439s">That's</a>  all I can say defense.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7283.22s">Oh,</a>  you're getting these toughness and defense you're getting these games close games Trusting your kids and trusting the guys out there. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7291.285s">I</a>  mean, that's what it takes to win a championship. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7293.187s">Is</a>  it not? <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7293.547s">Oh</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7293.847s">Oh,</a>  yeah, you gotta win close games because every team like I said from the quarterfinals on is good So you're gonna get into these kind of games So you got to be ready for you were worried about this West Haven team a little bit you and I had talked and you said you know I throw the records out they beat Glastonbury.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7308.359s">This</a>  was a tough test for you guys.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7309.94s">Oh,</a>  yeah, absolutely.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7310.821s">It</a>  was everything is advertised you saw it We saw every minute of it coach, you know <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7317.543s">We'll</a>  talk about this league real quick. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7319.124s">I</a>  mean, you guys are gonna face NFA in the semifinal. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7321.847s">They</a>  won tonight. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7322.908s">You're</a>  gonna see NFA for the fourth time. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7325.93s">What</a>  does that mean, not only for NFA New London, but what does it mean for the ECC?</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7329.773s">The</a>  ECC's done a phenomenal job representing itself in this tournament. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7334.097s">I'm</a>  happy for them, but one of us is gonna go home, and one of us is going to the championship. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7339.302s">But</a>  I know my guys are gonna be up for the task. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7341.544s">No</a>  matter if it's the fourth time, fifth time, sixth time, doesn't matter. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7344.566s">My</a>  guys are gonna be ready.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7345.657s">Great</a>  job tonight, Dave. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7346.738s">You're</a>  a game away from a state championship. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7349.159s">I'm</a>  sure one of the goals that you had at the beginning of the season when you first came into London.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_02]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7354.041s">Oh,</a>  absolutely. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7354.941s">That</a>  was the goal to bring it back to this city. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7356.942s">This</a>  is my city. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7357.883s">I</a>  want to represent the right way.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7359.524s">Hey,</a>  KC, the Whalers tonight in fashion on game day.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7364.866s">Thank</a>  you very much, Sports Doctor. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7366.407s">Well,</a>  we'll be with you Monday and Tuesday for semifinal action as long as we are granted permission, and we believe we will be. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7375.693s">We</a>  are very excited about whatever we can bring you Monday and Tuesday, but the ECC so well represented as well as Eastern Connecticut in general. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7384.717s">So</a>  many teams in the semis and heading to the finals will be at least a handful of ECC teams and hey, I said the knock on New London. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7392.901s">Yeah,</a>  they didn't know how to win the close ones. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7394.521s">Yeah,</a>  they won this one. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7397.258s">but</a>  I would suggest this was not a blueprint for how to close out a basketball team.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7401.46s">No,</a>  this is a recipe for kind of hang on a little bit. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7404.361s">And</a>  West Haven's a good team, but up 44 to 40, New London made it way too interesting, made it way harder on themselves with turnovers and some sloppy play than it had to be. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7415.547s">And</a>  you're going to find some of these other kids who didn't step up tonight are going to have to step up in order for them to deliver a state championship, whether it be the Savon Warren, whether it be <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7426.532s">Booboo</a>  Phillips, you know, but Jamiro Hall bailed them out with some big threes. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7431.393s">They</a>  stayed out of foul trouble. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7433.053s">Guy</a>  stayed on the court. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7434.114s">And,</a>  you know, here's the other thing, too. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7435.694s">You</a>  know, Dave told you I came here to win a championship. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7438.134s">He</a>  was not. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7438.995s">He</a>  was very candid about that.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7440.615s">Well,</a>  they are a semifinal victory away from a familiar foe toward heading to the Mohegan Sun with a chance at exactly that. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7450.297s">Somebody</a>  from the ECC is going to be competing for the Division two championship.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7455.178s">I</a>  think it's great for the league. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7456.758s">I</a>  think all these, Griswold winning tonight, NFA winning tonight, you know, Fitch in the semifinal, obviously St. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7463.44s">Bernard's</a>  up against a very, very tough East Catholic team who I think beat them this year.</p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_04]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7467.542s">St.</a> </p>

    <p>[SPEAKER_03]</a>:  <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7467.702s">Bernard</a>  beat East Catholic. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7468.742s">I'm</a>  sorry, St. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7469.362s">Bernard</a>  beat East Catholic. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7470.082s">So,</a>  I mean it's, in that division one's loaded. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7473.424s">It's</a>  gonna be great. <a href="https://youtu.be/LhCIZ9MEgmc&t=7473.904s">It's</a>  gonna be a great, great couple of days here.</p>
