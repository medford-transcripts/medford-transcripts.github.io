21
00:09:11,196 --> 00:09:17,638
[SPEAKER_04]: We're back in the saddle again, and we are ready for what should be a very entertaining and upbeat game tonight.

22
00:09:17,718 --> 00:09:18,538
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is March.

23
00:09:18,638 --> 00:09:21,119
[SPEAKER_03]: This is big boy basketball, Casey, as they would say.

24
00:09:21,179 --> 00:09:24,999
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, West Haven comes in hot off of a win against Glastonbury.

25
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,720
[SPEAKER_03]: New London, hot off of a win against Crosbury.

26
00:09:28,220 --> 00:09:32,921
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and take a second to talk about this New London team and head coach Dave Cornish and his travels.

27
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:35,822
[SPEAKER_03]: He's back home here at New London, and he's here to deliver.

28
00:09:36,402 --> 00:09:44,446
[SPEAKER_03]: another banner on the wall and you know what tonight's the next step to that you know that that goal that New London has had since they brought him back two years ago.

29
00:09:44,646 --> 00:10:05,117
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank you sports doctor a that's an excellent point but also I have missed your Sniglet's Crosby of Waterbury Crosbury it makes app it's pert makes perfect sense but I thought but you are spot-on when coach Cornish came back to his alma mater it's returning to a tradition of the state championship banners on the wall his legacy is

30
00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:13,698
[SPEAKER_04]: is not determined by or dependent upon but would certainly resonate more if he was one of the coaches.

31
00:10:13,718 --> 00:10:16,658
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean you look up there and you see Ralph Ruggiero and you see Chop Parker.

32
00:10:16,979 --> 00:10:24,540
[SPEAKER_04]: If his name could be put up there and he played for and coached for and with Ralph Ruggiero and Chop Parker.

33
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:31,342
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know those are his role models and his mentors and to put himself into that category would be huge for him.

34
00:10:31,362 --> 00:10:33,203
[SPEAKER_03]: And listen, we've known Dave for a long time.

35
00:10:33,223 --> 00:10:35,805
[SPEAKER_03]: This man eats and breathes basketball.

36
00:10:36,145 --> 00:10:40,247
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think him personally, Casey, he has that burning desire to deliver that championship.

37
00:10:40,287 --> 00:10:42,969
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, he got so close that led to a little stint at NFA.

38
00:10:42,989 --> 00:10:43,949
[SPEAKER_03]: But now he's here.

39
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:48,752
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's personal to him to put this banner back on the wall for the Northern Whalers.

40
00:10:49,012 --> 00:10:50,613
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's got the goods to do it this year.

41
00:10:50,913 --> 00:10:52,314
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a very, very deep team.

42
00:10:52,334 --> 00:10:53,695
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got some good seniors.

43
00:10:54,495 --> 00:10:56,156
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got some great role players.

44
00:10:56,677 --> 00:10:57,197
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're healthy.

45
00:10:57,617 --> 00:10:58,778
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're clicking at the right time.

46
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:01,120
[SPEAKER_04]: He's also spot on about the tournament.

47
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:06,685
[SPEAKER_04]: When I saw him during the ECC tournament and the brackets had come out, I said, who are you going to get in the second round?

48
00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:08,066
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes, we're going to get Crosby.

49
00:11:08,106 --> 00:11:09,107
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, then what, Glassenbury?

50
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:10,928
[SPEAKER_04]: He goes, no, West Haven's going to be in that game.

51
00:11:10,949 --> 00:11:12,170
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, and that's the team.

52
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:16,013
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, that team can win the state championship.

53
00:11:16,373 --> 00:11:17,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Scared of them a little bit.

54
00:11:17,354 --> 00:11:18,955
[SPEAKER_04]: So he saw that coming.

55
00:11:19,016 --> 00:11:20,076
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, you know, forget.

56
00:11:20,337 --> 00:11:21,698
[SPEAKER_04]: He knew who the teams were going to be.

57
00:11:21,758 --> 00:11:23,560
[SPEAKER_04]: He had every bracket called.

58
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,500
[SPEAKER_04]: He's remarkable.

59
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take a moment for the national anthem.

60
00:11:36,958 --> 00:12:01,851
[SPEAKER_05]: by the dawn's early light, what so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming, whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, o'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming?

61
00:12:02,691 --> 00:12:06,133
[SPEAKER_05]: And the rocket's red glare,

62
00:12:06,753 --> 00:12:33,638
[SPEAKER_05]: ♪ The bombs bursting in air ♪ ♪ Gave proof through the night ♪ ♪ That our flag was still there ♪ ♪ O say does that star-spangled banner yet wave ♪ ♪ O'er the land of the free ♪

63
00:12:36,575 --> 00:12:38,849
Oh, what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh

64
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:47,514
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I think this new London team has the goods for sure.

65
00:12:47,554 --> 00:12:50,816
[SPEAKER_04]: We said it all the way back at the Classic when they were taking on St.

66
00:12:50,856 --> 00:12:51,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Bernard.

67
00:12:51,156 --> 00:12:57,039
[SPEAKER_04]: We said this is the deepest, most talented roster he's ever had, albeit Ledgerd, NFA.

68
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,341
[SPEAKER_04]: He's had some great rosters at Ledgerd, certainly at NFA.

69
00:13:00,561 --> 00:13:04,784
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't think he's ever had as deep and talented a roster as this one.

70
00:13:04,824 --> 00:13:07,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is going to be a very big challenge for them, because they cannot

71
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:17,675
[SPEAKER_04]: have droughts of scoring they cannot get lazy on defense they cannot get into foul trouble this is a game where they're going to have to play all the way through to win.

72
00:13:18,335 --> 00:13:24,702
[SPEAKER_03]: And you talk about situational basketball playing with the lead down the stretch knowing how to hang on to things and you know

73
00:13:25,402 --> 00:13:29,327
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're so deep like this, who's going to step up off the bench as well?

74
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:36,936
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we've seen it a few different times with, you know, Amir Hall or Gaskin or, you know, Jack Philliston giving you some good minutes, 2KC.

75
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:43,324
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the first couple of games, too, they've had a couple of pieces of the puzzle getting to foul trouble early, you know, whether it's Jackson, Bonet.

76
00:13:43,344 --> 00:13:44,845
[SPEAKER_03]: So keeping your guys on the floor.

77
00:13:45,646 --> 00:13:47,727
[SPEAKER_03]: in the beginning of the game, very important for this Wheeler squad.

78
00:13:48,147 --> 00:13:48,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

79
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:54,788
[SPEAKER_04]: We saw in the previous game that the whole dynamic changes with Bidet off the floor.

80
00:13:55,348 --> 00:13:58,129
[SPEAKER_04]: New London is not a particularly tall team.

81
00:13:58,169 --> 00:14:00,409
[SPEAKER_04]: They're good sized across.

82
00:14:00,449 --> 00:14:02,210
[SPEAKER_04]: They have length and depth.

83
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:07,671
[SPEAKER_04]: But Bidet's really the anchor in the middle that gives them both defense and scoring.

84
00:14:08,191 --> 00:14:11,652
[SPEAKER_04]: When Philiston has to come into the game for him, they lose on the offensive end.

85
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:17,878
[SPEAKER_04]: and it changes the dynamic and it increases what Savon Warren and Troy McKelvin Jr.

86
00:14:17,918 --> 00:14:28,550
[SPEAKER_04]: have to do so it is definitely a little different for them so they really have to focus on keeping that five as healthy and as you know in shape on the court from a fouls perspective.

87
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:30,871
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my old sayings was be productive.

88
00:14:31,191 --> 00:14:36,214
[SPEAKER_03]: And Baudette's one of those kids, especially, you said, from a big man standpoint on the offensive end.

89
00:14:36,674 --> 00:14:38,235
[SPEAKER_03]: When he's out there, he's contributing.

90
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:39,736
[SPEAKER_03]: He scored 18 points the other night.

91
00:14:40,136 --> 00:14:42,497
[SPEAKER_03]: He got himself a little right end after some foul trouble early.

92
00:14:42,517 --> 00:14:43,858
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's a guy they need.

93
00:14:43,878 --> 00:14:48,520
[SPEAKER_03]: He does a lot of the little things, too, that people don't notice during a basketball game.

94
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,361
[SPEAKER_03]: He plays very hard with a lot of fire.

95
00:14:50,781 --> 00:14:54,023
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think the first four or five minutes of this game very important.

96
00:14:54,443 --> 00:14:56,764
[SPEAKER_03]: See who kind of gets out of the gate and kind of sets the tone early.

97
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:02,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Opening tip is sponsored by Kutcher Financial.

98
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:09,288
[SPEAKER_04]: When you want more than just tips, when you want sound financial planning, go see Lee Kutcher at Kutcher Financial in New London.

99
00:15:09,628 --> 00:15:14,329
[SPEAKER_04]: Lee can help you with financial planning and investment, tax preparation and planning for your business and your personal needs.

100
00:15:14,749 --> 00:15:18,570
[SPEAKER_04]: So feel better about your financial decisions, go to Kutcher Financial.

101
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:28,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Starting five for West Haven, Brian Tillman a senior, Aaron Johnson a junior, LaShawn Roman a junior, and a pair of sophomores, Ja'Kai Little and Kanan Morris.

102
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:32,039
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a young overall team for West Haven.

103
00:15:32,059 --> 00:15:39,504
[SPEAKER_04]: For New London, Deshawn Phillips and Savon Warren and Jackson Baudette the three seniors, JJ Robinson the junior and Troy McKelvin Jr.

104
00:15:39,524 --> 00:15:40,104
[SPEAKER_04]: the sophomore.

105
00:15:40,445 --> 00:15:40,945
[SPEAKER_04]: Ready to go.

106
00:15:41,005 --> 00:15:45,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Baudette will jump it against LaShawn Roman and we will be underway

107
00:15:46,694 --> 00:15:47,395
[SPEAKER_04]: here in a moment.

108
00:15:47,755 --> 00:16:02,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's have some fun tonight Casey throw the records out the window when you get this deep into tournament play whether to go NCAA or high school level state tournament these teams are all good let's have some fun tonight here at the Mecca as you would call it you did not say that yet tonight.

109
00:16:02,707 --> 00:16:12,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Not tonight I said Madison Square Garden the Mecca the other night but I didn't want to be repetitive just got a little love from the new London alumni that was

110
00:16:13,815 --> 00:16:22,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Supporting us tonight a former state champion basketball player here at New London High School wanted to wish his whalers luck and say support what game day does.

111
00:16:22,239 --> 00:16:28,542
[SPEAKER_04]: So Roman jumps and the tip won by Westhaven and we're underway.

112
00:16:29,142 --> 00:16:33,324
[SPEAKER_03]: New London come out a little man-to-man early Robinson wreaking havoc.

113
00:16:35,986 --> 00:16:41,028
[SPEAKER_04]: Three-man officials crew Kevin Kobelski, Ben Alamo and Christopher Parker are your three officials.

114
00:16:47,137 --> 00:16:49,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Very deliberate Westhaven on the first possession.

115
00:16:50,619 --> 00:16:53,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Pull up three is up no good, boxed out by Bidette.

116
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:56,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Roman, who jumped, stepped out for the three.

117
00:16:57,544 --> 00:17:00,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson all the way to the rack, high and scores over Roman.

118
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:01,927
[SPEAKER_03]: Gets the Wailers on the board.

119
00:17:01,947 --> 00:17:08,892
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and Robinson's one of those kids where the coaching staff, I mean, all 12 of them with it for the London, are constantly telling him, attack the rim, attack the rim.

120
00:17:08,912 --> 00:17:12,934
[SPEAKER_03]: That time you saw Robinson doing work at the finish at the glass case, he threw nothing to London.

121
00:17:13,174 --> 00:17:15,056
[SPEAKER_04]: We like the one-to-one coach to player ratio.

122
00:17:16,142 --> 00:17:17,188
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of guys over there.

123
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:19,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, they all work well together.

124
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:19,822
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a great staff.

125
00:17:22,156 --> 00:17:34,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Brian Tillman, the senior point guard, steps into a three himself, back iron no good, Boo Boo Phillips with a rebound, he'll push, dribbles through traffic, up ahead, Warren again tries to dunk and misses again.

126
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:39,701
[SPEAKER_04]: He has been trying to get that one to go and his team and the coaching staff are saying would you please just lay it in the basket.

127
00:17:39,981 --> 00:17:42,881
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's one of those, he wanted to get the action up early.

128
00:17:42,921 --> 00:17:46,682
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a half a step away for a little kiss off the glass, little George Girvin finger roll.

129
00:17:47,102 --> 00:17:48,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Take the easy two fella, you know.

130
00:17:50,284 --> 00:17:53,965
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes off Westhaven so New London will have the possession but that is an easy two.

131
00:17:55,146 --> 00:17:59,188
[SPEAKER_04]: So far the New London speed bothering Westhaven they've been able to get to the rack twice.

132
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:06,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson up the top of the key now with Tillman on him.

133
00:18:07,612 --> 00:18:08,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Soft defense from Tillman.

134
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:14,815
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of teams settle into zone against New London trying to make them shoot from the perimeter.

135
00:18:17,435 --> 00:18:23,278
[SPEAKER_04]: High screen from Padet, Robinson kicks, Phillips spot up three, no good.

136
00:18:24,718 --> 00:18:29,380
[SPEAKER_04]: And out of bounds it goes, it'll stay Whaler basketball, but only eight seconds now on the shot clock.

137
00:18:30,121 --> 00:18:36,143
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Phillips was one of those kids the other night, first round action, Casey got hot from the three point line, a little cold the other night.

138
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:39,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Find his touch and find his rhythm early.

139
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:46,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson to inbound, right in front of the West Haven bench.

140
00:18:48,079 --> 00:18:58,282
[SPEAKER_04]: Dumps to Baudette, kicked back to Robinson, drives, hangs, floats, no good, and a rebound comes down to Roman, and off to Tillman.

141
00:19:01,283 --> 00:19:05,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Straightaway three is up and good from Kanan Morris, the sophomore.

142
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:20,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Cross court pass to Phillips, looking for McKelvin on the block, instead swinging around.

143
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,851
[SPEAKER_04]: They will let New London shoot those threes.

144
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:26,993
[SPEAKER_03]: See how they attack the zone, whether it's from the side, Casey, or right down the middle.

145
00:19:27,973 --> 00:19:30,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Phillips pulls up, steps up, and buries it.

146
00:19:30,415 --> 00:19:31,355
[SPEAKER_03]: He got bailed out there.

147
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,136
[SPEAKER_03]: He got double teamed.

148
00:19:32,156 --> 00:19:33,776
[SPEAKER_03]: He rose up, knocked down a tough two.

149
00:19:33,796 --> 00:19:37,218
[SPEAKER_03]: A little eight-footer for Phillips on the baseline.

150
00:19:38,699 --> 00:19:42,601
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a senior, and when he gets cooking, man, he is a handful.

151
00:19:48,873 --> 00:20:01,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Roman double-teamed finds the cutter wild shot no good and Phillips blocked Johnson but they're gonna say you got a piece that's gonna send Johnson to the line and he'll shoot too.

152
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:11,509
[SPEAKER_03]: And backside boxing out who's assigned to that man Savon Warren's gonna slip in there you know the one and done one and done those are kind of the small things that one will have to do tonight.

153
00:20:14,643 --> 00:20:18,165
[SPEAKER_04]: It was one thing giving up the cut, but giving up the offensive rebound, that's the problem.

154
00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:22,927
[SPEAKER_04]: So they were covered to defend the cut, but they were not in position to then rebound off of it.

155
00:20:22,947 --> 00:20:29,291
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the, when you get beat like that, it's not only the shot that you have to account for, it's the weak side rebound and they couldn't do both.

156
00:20:29,471 --> 00:20:31,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially a team like London who wants to go off of a make.

157
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:36,675
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they want to go, they want to leak out, they want to run, secure the ball first, and then get up the court.

158
00:20:38,018 --> 00:20:45,082
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're going against a team like this, whether it's Warren or McKelvin or Bourdette, and even Phillips, sometimes it takes four guys on a glass.

159
00:20:45,482 --> 00:20:50,405
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like West Haven might be setting up a little bit of pressure here as they brought two of their guards up off the make.

160
00:20:51,385 --> 00:20:53,646
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're just going to go with a little 2-1-2.

161
00:20:53,947 --> 00:20:56,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Which gave New London some problems the other night when Crosby ran it.

162
00:20:57,769 --> 00:20:59,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Crosby just ran a simple 2-3.

163
00:20:59,189 --> 00:21:00,890
[SPEAKER_04]: New London should be experiencing how to break it.

164
00:21:02,031 --> 00:21:03,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the trap right there.

165
00:21:03,091 --> 00:21:05,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson.

166
00:21:09,361 --> 00:21:10,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Norton's got to get somebody into the middle.

167
00:21:10,802 --> 00:21:11,782
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a 2-3 zone.

168
00:21:11,802 --> 00:21:12,222
[SPEAKER_04]: They know it.

169
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,583
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got to get someone in the middle.

170
00:21:15,924 --> 00:21:17,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson floats.

171
00:21:17,685 --> 00:21:19,805
[SPEAKER_03]: No good, but he'll go to the line and shoot a pair.

172
00:21:19,985 --> 00:21:22,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, Robinson getting off to an aggressive start.

173
00:21:22,587 --> 00:21:23,867
[SPEAKER_03]: It's his third trip to the 10.

174
00:21:24,447 --> 00:21:26,468
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a bucket, and he's got a trip to the line for two.

175
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:30,010
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess if that's how you're going to beat the zone, you're going to reverse the ball and have him kick in and go.

176
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,452
[SPEAKER_03]: know Robinson right now hot start here for New London.

177
00:21:34,112 --> 00:21:56,346
[SPEAKER_04]: And certainly when Robinson's playing with a head of steam that's when he's at his best you know yeah he was against the Whalers for you know for two years and they got used to that you know full steam ahead play he was actually a big thorn in their side because he was just relentless constantly going downhill and so now I think they've been waiting all year for him to feel acclimated here enough to

178
00:21:56,926 --> 00:22:04,869
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it took him, you know, a good at least half the season to get comfortable with the, you know, with the scheme and the style and not look over his shoulders so much to the coaches.

179
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:09,811
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's come on, you know, very, very well down the stretch this season, especially on a defensive end.

180
00:22:10,291 --> 00:22:11,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Knocks them both down.

181
00:22:11,291 --> 00:22:12,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Pressure here by New London.

182
00:22:12,732 --> 00:22:14,072
[SPEAKER_04]: New London will go into their pressure.

183
00:22:15,653 --> 00:22:18,214
[SPEAKER_04]: And just a step late is Robinson.

184
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the danger in the other direction.

185
00:22:19,594 --> 00:22:22,875
[SPEAKER_04]: And out of bounds, it goes as Phillips got a piece.

186
00:22:23,015 --> 00:22:24,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Bidet was trying to draw the charge.

187
00:22:26,251 --> 00:22:28,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job by Panette, protecting the rim.

188
00:22:39,345 --> 00:22:43,789
[SPEAKER_04]: New London comfortable letting West Haven shoot the three as well, so they'll be in that zone as well.

189
00:22:45,351 --> 00:22:48,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Second one goes up, no good from Morris Robinson.

190
00:22:51,045 --> 00:22:53,126
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was a step in by Tillman.

191
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:55,467
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a nice move right there, that step in.

192
00:22:56,067 --> 00:22:59,549
[SPEAKER_04]: And fortunately for Robinson, Tillman got a piece of it and went out of bounds.

193
00:23:00,689 --> 00:23:03,151
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Lornen likes to run off of a miss.

194
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:14,075
[SPEAKER_04]: On the floor right now, the only real shooter here that, you know, Phillips, if he's spotting up, Amir Hall is their real other three-point threat.

195
00:23:14,416 --> 00:23:15,336
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get a foul.

196
00:23:15,976 --> 00:23:17,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Salon Warren got hit.

197
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:22,598
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, that's the problem with not moving the basketball around the perimeter a little bit.

198
00:23:22,958 --> 00:23:24,258
[SPEAKER_03]: You get sucked into the corner.

199
00:23:24,298 --> 00:23:25,259
[SPEAKER_03]: The double team comes.

200
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:26,619
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nobody in the middle.

201
00:23:26,879 --> 00:23:29,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe Phillips has got to make his way back to the basketball and ask for it.

202
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,901
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a tough place for Warren actually to pick up his dribble.

203
00:23:32,921 --> 00:23:33,901
[SPEAKER_03]: He's in no man's land out there.

204
00:23:34,221 --> 00:23:36,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Caden Gaskin into the game for New London.

205
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:38,802
[SPEAKER_04]: We mentioned Amir Hall, who's battling a foot problem.

206
00:23:39,102 --> 00:23:41,583
[SPEAKER_04]: But he's their best shooter, pure shooter.

207
00:23:43,163 --> 00:23:44,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Phillips can knock it down as well.

208
00:23:44,683 --> 00:23:47,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, he drives the basket, kicks out.

209
00:23:47,704 --> 00:23:50,025
[SPEAKER_04]: KK just into the game for three, no good.

210
00:23:51,045 --> 00:23:54,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Weak side, rebound was tipped and comes to West Haven.

211
00:23:56,246 --> 00:24:00,407
[SPEAKER_04]: Tillman can fly with the basketball, kicks out, and Johnson has it now.

212
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:05,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice look underneath, turn around Jay, no good from Roman.

213
00:24:05,128 --> 00:24:06,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I think he had a little room to go closer.

214
00:24:08,469 --> 00:24:10,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson, tied up on his way to the basket.

215
00:24:12,637 --> 00:24:16,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Jump ball possession arrow favors New London so they'll keep it here.

216
00:24:17,018 --> 00:24:20,318
[SPEAKER_03]: Robinson shows you that ball just a little bit on his way to the basket.

217
00:24:20,699 --> 00:24:22,759
[SPEAKER_03]: Defenders come on over and they make it a good play.

218
00:24:23,199 --> 00:24:24,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Put that ball on the opposite side of your hip.

219
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:27,140
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it ready to roll and keep it ready to shoot.

220
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson inbounds.

221
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Lob to Deshaun Phillips.

222
00:24:36,202 --> 00:24:37,122
[SPEAKER_04]: Crowd filtering in.

223
00:24:37,382 --> 00:24:38,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Good crowd here for this one.

224
00:24:42,472 --> 00:24:49,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Phillips tries to drive baseline, picks it up, dumps it down, and stolen as he was trying to go for Bidette.

225
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice move to the basket by Roman, but he couldn't get it to go.

226
00:24:58,784 --> 00:25:01,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaskin with the rebound and an arm bar that he got away with.

227
00:25:01,746 --> 00:25:06,089
[SPEAKER_04]: Now Gaskin, little stutter step.

228
00:25:07,010 --> 00:25:11,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Too much one-on-one from the Whalers, and I think the coaches are going to be saying something in a second.

229
00:25:17,193 --> 00:25:19,854
[SPEAKER_03]: gets a hand on it knocks it out of bounds it'll stay with West Haven.

230
00:25:19,934 --> 00:25:31,556
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean New London is extremely active on the defensive end disrupting West Haven you know a lot of hands a good job on the defensive glass offensively right now sputtering struggling against that zone.

231
00:25:31,716 --> 00:25:45,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Brandon Bellamy and Tyrone Ogletree check into the game no size lost by West Haven Ogletree is a big as well he's a senior as well all the way back it goes to Bellamy he'll take on the point guard responsibilities with Brian Tillman.

232
00:25:46,867 --> 00:25:48,727
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see if Bellamy is a little bit more of a shooter.

233
00:25:49,528 --> 00:25:53,869
[SPEAKER_04]: And New London will have to come out of the zone if he is, or extend the zone if he is.

234
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,871
[SPEAKER_04]: And there it is, corner three, up short.

235
00:26:01,691 --> 00:26:02,991
[SPEAKER_04]: McKelvin gets the rebound.

236
00:26:03,751 --> 00:26:06,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaskin, ahead to Robinson.

237
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,213
[SPEAKER_04]: He's tied up, finds McKelvin.

238
00:26:09,273 --> 00:26:11,913
[SPEAKER_04]: McKelvin, left hand, wild shot, no good.

239
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Baudette, offensive rebound, misses the bunny.

240
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Four different shots, four different layups tonight right now in the London's Mist.

241
00:26:20,973 --> 00:26:24,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy opportunities, they earn them with the offensive rebounds, they can't convert.

242
00:26:25,374 --> 00:26:35,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Badette was in such good position for the offensive rebound, and that's a shot, I mean, he wasn't even challenged, which he's used to being, and ends up missing what is almost a guaranteed make for him.

243
00:26:38,277 --> 00:26:43,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Pull up jumper in the lane, soft touch goes down for Morris.

244
00:26:44,357 --> 00:26:45,638
[SPEAKER_04]: He's got five of their seven.

245
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:46,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Friendly rim.

246
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:49,059
[SPEAKER_03]: Hit three different parts of the rim.

247
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,340
[SPEAKER_03]: Go down to find the bottom of the net.

248
00:26:52,641 --> 00:26:53,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Phillips for three.

249
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:54,342
[SPEAKER_04]: No good.

250
00:26:54,402 --> 00:26:55,923
[SPEAKER_04]: McKelvin, weak side rebound.

251
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:57,143
[SPEAKER_04]: Knocked out of bounds.

252
00:26:57,203 --> 00:26:58,404
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be West Haven ball.

253
00:26:59,704 --> 00:27:06,067
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think McKelvin got bumped, and that's what he's saying, but it was off of him.

254
00:27:06,087 --> 00:27:10,510
[SPEAKER_04]: 22-22 was our score in the first, in the Whalers-Crosby game the other night.

255
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,350
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 7-6 with 147 remaining.

256
00:27:21,131 --> 00:27:24,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Long pass, three on two here for Westhaven.

257
00:27:24,872 --> 00:27:26,092
[SPEAKER_04]: Pull up three, no good.

258
00:27:26,572 --> 00:27:27,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Phillips high for the rebound.

259
00:27:27,953 --> 00:27:29,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Great job by Nolan again, one and done.

260
00:27:30,873 --> 00:27:33,634
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson, wild, blocked.

261
00:27:36,115 --> 00:27:39,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming in the other direction now is Westhaven.

262
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:47,417
[SPEAKER_04]: Pull up, jump shot is good from Brian Tillman.

263
00:27:47,797 --> 00:27:48,738
[SPEAKER_04]: And the lead is three.

264
00:27:49,778 --> 00:27:50,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, nice jump shot.

265
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:54,079
[SPEAKER_03]: 12 feet out, pull up and knock it down.

266
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:54,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean look.

267
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,701
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now New London just struggling to get a good look against the zone.

268
00:28:05,742 --> 00:28:07,163
[SPEAKER_04]: Dump down to McKelvin on the block.

269
00:28:08,323 --> 00:28:10,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Rises up and buries a baseline jump shot.

270
00:28:11,084 --> 00:28:12,944
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big time shot from the sophomore.

271
00:28:12,964 --> 00:28:16,325
[SPEAKER_03]: The turn, the look, rise up, catch it high, shoot it high.

272
00:28:16,365 --> 00:28:17,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Troy McKelvin Jr.

273
00:28:18,186 --> 00:28:19,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Robinson gets the steal.

274
00:28:19,866 --> 00:28:21,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Phillips heads to the basket.

275
00:28:23,046 --> 00:28:28,108
[SPEAKER_04]: and finishes at the rim over Bellamy, and just like that the Wailers are on top.

276
00:28:28,689 --> 00:28:31,690
[SPEAKER_04]: And another turnover, that's the lunch pail work the Wailers like to do.

277
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:33,911
[SPEAKER_04]: Bidette with a smart play.

278
00:28:35,052 --> 00:28:41,955
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaskin, again they hold it up, the shot clock and game clock are effectively even, it's about a half a second difference.

279
00:28:43,336 --> 00:28:46,077
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Wailers can have a lead in the last shot if they choose so.

280
00:28:46,653 --> 00:28:50,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Gaskin with ready hands in the corner, ready to shoot the three if the ball comes his way.

281
00:28:50,735 --> 00:28:52,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Normally that's Amir Hall's spot.

282
00:28:52,436 --> 00:28:54,477
[SPEAKER_04]: He's their spot up shooter, but we haven't seen him yet.

283
00:28:55,437 --> 00:28:57,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Look for a little clear out here for Robinson.

284
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:01,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Gets it underneath, loses it, saves it long.

285
00:29:02,281 --> 00:29:05,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Five seconds, West Haven now has a chance to get a shot off.

286
00:29:05,882 --> 00:29:09,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Step back, good if it goes, and in and out.

287
00:29:09,284 --> 00:29:11,085
[SPEAKER_04]: 10-9 at the end of one.

288
00:29:11,105 --> 00:29:12,826
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be right back with second quarter action.

289
00:29:12,846 --> 00:29:14,787

00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:49,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Your financial future awaits.

300
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:55,788
[SPEAKER_04]: At Kutcher Financial in New London, Connecticut, financial advisor Lee Kutcher offers a path forward.

304
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:27,502
[SPEAKER_04]: One point lead for the Whalers after one and you know Sports Doctor we saw a monumentally poor shooting night from Crosby two nights ago and only a slightly better shooting night by New London.

305
00:30:28,163 --> 00:30:28,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight

306
00:30:29,912 --> 00:30:34,433
[SPEAKER_04]: West Haven's not shooting the ball particularly well either, but New London has given gift after gift.

307
00:30:34,653 --> 00:30:37,294
[SPEAKER_03]: They've seen this zone defense all year long.

308
00:30:37,414 --> 00:30:39,574
[SPEAKER_03]: It just seems like they're not executing.

309
00:30:39,594 --> 00:30:40,815
[SPEAKER_03]: The ball is not moving.

310
00:30:41,435 --> 00:30:44,236
[SPEAKER_03]: It can't be all about Robinson and dribble penetration.

311
00:30:44,316 --> 00:30:53,398
[SPEAKER_03]: Reverse the basketball, find the cracks in the zone, find the action on the back end, but it just seems like it's extremely stagnant right now for New London.

312
00:30:53,418 --> 00:30:57,119
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you said, without Amir Hall out there with the threat of a three-point shot, they're easy to defend.

313
00:30:57,539 --> 00:30:58,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Right to the rack.

314
00:30:59,912 --> 00:31:02,514
[SPEAKER_04]: Ja'Kai Little puts Westhaven back on top.

315
00:31:08,398 --> 00:31:15,823
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, no movement, nobody flashing to the center, Bourdette trying to post, but not a real offensive threat, not making himself available.

316
00:31:16,944 --> 00:31:26,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson, pump fakes, kicks out, now Gaskin drives, floater blocked, out of bounds, it'll stay with the Whalers, and Savon Warren's gonna check back into the ballgame.

317
00:31:27,533 --> 00:31:31,754
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've talked about creating a look on the perimeter against the zone.

318
00:31:32,315 --> 00:31:36,956
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not passing the ball around the perimeter, maybe it's going inside, then back outside.

319
00:31:36,996 --> 00:31:41,698
[SPEAKER_03]: So if Gaskin's got a spot up, if Phillips has got a spot up, create some room that way.

320
00:31:43,465 --> 00:31:47,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Active hands by West Haven knocks the inbounds pass away.

321
00:31:47,827 --> 00:31:52,608
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing you notice too, Casey, is any kind of lazy pass tonight is going to be contested.

322
00:31:53,029 --> 00:31:53,909
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be tipped.

323
00:31:54,729 --> 00:31:59,231
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, West Haven is too fast, too big, and too talented to get away with lazy passes.

324
00:31:59,671 --> 00:32:01,532
[SPEAKER_04]: McKelvin gets the inbound.

325
00:32:02,212 --> 00:32:03,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Phillips for three, no good.

326
00:32:04,253 --> 00:32:10,356
[SPEAKER_04]: Baudette, offensive rebound and he can't get it to go, but Warren flies in for the tip and they needed that one.

327
00:32:10,636 --> 00:32:11,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Get on top again by a point.

328
00:32:11,837 --> 00:32:13,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Crash the glass, relentless.

329
00:32:14,158 --> 00:32:15,579
[SPEAKER_03]: Savon Warren at the cup.

330
00:32:16,419 --> 00:32:19,481
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, Baudette normally converts these opportunities.

331
00:32:19,781 --> 00:32:21,902
[SPEAKER_03]: He's given himself easy chances.

332
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:23,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Knock him in, son.

333
00:32:24,198 --> 00:32:31,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson on the weak side block that numbers Morris had it instead Warren the other direction and they're gonna call him for the travel.

334
00:32:32,521 --> 00:32:35,622
[SPEAKER_04]: New London can't seem to get out of their own way right now.

335
00:32:35,922 --> 00:32:45,205
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're creating things they're putting themselves in a position to turnovers the block shots the numbers the leak out settle down gather yourself a little bit out there.

336
00:32:51,122 --> 00:32:55,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Down it goes, they have a double team and another steal as they took it from Roman.

337
00:32:55,465 --> 00:32:56,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson the other direction.

338
00:32:57,546 --> 00:32:59,328
[SPEAKER_04]: High off the glass, no good.

339
00:32:59,688 --> 00:33:02,290
[SPEAKER_04]: McKelvin turns it around and buries the short.

340
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:04,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Put back from about five feet.

341
00:33:04,751 --> 00:33:05,592
[SPEAKER_04]: The Whalers up three.

342
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:17,640
[SPEAKER_03]: London back to a man.

343
00:33:19,602 --> 00:33:19,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Tillman.

344
00:33:23,865 --> 00:33:24,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Now Little.

345
00:33:27,468 --> 00:33:29,750
[SPEAKER_04]: Up on top to Aaron Johnson.

346
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:30,891
[SPEAKER_04]: He pulls up for three.

347
00:33:31,231 --> 00:33:31,732
[SPEAKER_04]: No good.

348
00:33:33,433 --> 00:33:34,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Contested by Warren.

349
00:33:36,496 --> 00:33:37,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Other direction now.

350
00:33:37,457 --> 00:33:38,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson.

351
00:33:41,921 --> 00:33:43,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Bidet calls for it on the block.

352
00:33:44,583 --> 00:33:46,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, Whalers will go perimeter.

353
00:33:46,185 --> 00:33:47,366
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to give it in to McKelvin.

354
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:48,987
[SPEAKER_04]: On the baseline, he has it.

355
00:33:52,803 --> 00:33:54,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Now Bidette comes and sets a screen.

356
00:33:54,724 --> 00:33:57,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson uses the screen, kicks it back to Bidette.

357
00:33:57,525 --> 00:33:58,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Shot clock down to 10.

358
00:33:59,466 --> 00:34:00,486
[SPEAKER_04]: Shot clock down to eight.

359
00:34:00,586 --> 00:34:02,907
[SPEAKER_04]: Phillips tries to create on his own.

360
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Wild shot, no good.

361
00:34:04,968 --> 00:34:06,148
[SPEAKER_04]: And Westhaven's gonna run.

362
00:34:06,508 --> 00:34:07,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Up ahead of everybody.

363
00:34:08,069 --> 00:34:11,650
[SPEAKER_04]: Running the floor and missing it was Ja'Kai Little.

364
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:15,492
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson and Phillips have done a great job contesting layups.

365
00:34:18,553 --> 00:34:19,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Westhaven extending a little bit.

366
00:34:23,205 --> 00:34:27,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Bedeck puts it on the floor and gets a foul called against Ja'Kai Little.

367
00:34:28,026 --> 00:34:30,687
[SPEAKER_03]: And in an offensive end, Phillips looks a little bit out of sorts.

368
00:34:30,747 --> 00:34:33,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Casey, he takes one dribble, he picks it up at the top of the key.

369
00:34:33,948 --> 00:34:35,689
[SPEAKER_03]: He kind of kills himself up there.

370
00:34:35,709 --> 00:34:37,749
[SPEAKER_03]: He's going to come out, and I'm sure the coach is going to talk to him.

371
00:34:37,769 --> 00:34:39,530
[SPEAKER_03]: But keep that dribble alive.

372
00:34:39,590 --> 00:34:40,210
[SPEAKER_03]: Be productive.

373
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Do something with the basketball.

374
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:45,852
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the pounding and the dribbling and then picking it up, it's not creating anything out there for the Whalers.

375
00:34:46,132 --> 00:34:47,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Phillips is a better basketball player than that.

376
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:50,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Jameer Hall checks into the game for New London.

377
00:34:51,573 --> 00:34:56,176
[SPEAKER_04]: And so does Jack Philliston, Baudette, and Phillips have a seat.

378
00:34:56,836 --> 00:35:00,178
[SPEAKER_04]: So look for your scoring here to come through Robinson and Warren.

379
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:03,379
[SPEAKER_04]: And a turnover on the inbound.

380
00:35:09,923 --> 00:35:13,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Into the game, into the lane rather, Tillman.

381
00:35:18,002 --> 00:35:19,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Tillman handles the ball an awful lot.

382
00:35:19,764 --> 00:35:22,168
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of responsibility in the young man's hands.

383
00:35:24,391 --> 00:35:24,911
[SPEAKER_03]: The senior.

384
00:35:26,393 --> 00:35:27,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Step back, pull back.

385
00:35:27,675 --> 00:35:28,776
[SPEAKER_04]: Glass is good.

386
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:31,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Tillman knocks down the shot in a timeout.

387
00:35:32,061 --> 00:35:35,105
[SPEAKER_04]: West Haven, as they've cut it to one.

388
00:35:36,865 --> 00:35:37,666
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, good ballgame.

389
00:35:37,686 --> 00:35:45,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you feel like New London, if they could convert on some of these easy opportunities, Casey, they'd be up by a half dozen or so.

390
00:35:45,718 --> 00:35:46,619
[SPEAKER_04]: 14-13 New London.

391
00:35:46,639 --> 00:35:47,440
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll take a quick break.

392
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,263

[SPEAKER_04]: Visit us online or call now to book.

401
00:36:31,491 --> 00:36:48,723
[SPEAKER_04]: We're back second quarter 445 remaining in the half 1413 New London if you're interested in the other quarterfinal that this game will match up with NFA with a one-point lead in the basketball with 15 seconds as they take on innovation trying to

402
00:36:49,723 --> 00:36:54,906
[SPEAKER_04]: create a all ECC semifinal the first half of it is in NFA's hands right now.

403
00:36:54,966 --> 00:37:01,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Boy this league has done extremely well in the state tournament both sides girls and boys and I'm a huge Jeff Brown fan.

404
00:37:01,429 --> 00:37:05,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Griswold has a chance tonight as well talk a little bit about them.

405
00:37:05,371 --> 00:37:12,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Hall brings it up the floor Phillips back in the game and a kick ball.

406
00:37:12,855 --> 00:37:16,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Westhaven back into the zone Casey off the timeout looking to trap

407
00:37:17,581 --> 00:37:25,523
[SPEAKER_03]: At the top of the key look at the trap when the ball moves and the one who's going to get that thing cooking side to side flash somebody to the middle find the open spots.

408
00:37:28,544 --> 00:37:34,466
[SPEAKER_03]: You know right now in this point of this game with four and a half minutes ago before half and Phillips is going to find himself a little bit on the offensive end.

409
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:42,849
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean he's got to be the scorer here with Warren McKelvin can work around the block but Hall and Philliston are not much of the offensive threat.

410
00:37:46,592 --> 00:37:51,673
[SPEAKER_04]: Warren, beautiful look underneath to McKelvin, basket is good, and the foul.

411
00:37:52,033 --> 00:37:58,535
[SPEAKER_04]: And nobody, nobody has seen more banners here than Troy McKelvin, senior and junior would love to add another.

412
00:37:58,635 --> 00:38:09,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Well again, that's the look that time, you know, McKelvin making himself available on the baseline, hanging around, getting ready hands, son, for two at the rim and flexing a little muscle, I like that.

413
00:38:09,758 --> 00:38:15,160
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and a good look that time by Warren, you know, recognize him out of the corner of his eye that dished in the delivery.

414
00:38:15,521 --> 00:38:16,681
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the patience, right?

415
00:38:16,701 --> 00:38:22,624
[SPEAKER_04]: We looked around a little bit instead of just blindly flying to the basket, which has been part of their issue.

416
00:38:22,944 --> 00:38:24,725
[SPEAKER_04]: Take a moment, survey.

417
00:38:26,566 --> 00:38:33,749
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of their misses at the rim, Casey, you feel have been rushed a little bit, you know, by Baudette, by Warren, except great patience that time.

418
00:38:39,354 --> 00:38:42,616
[SPEAKER_04]: Four minutes, halfway through the second quarter.

419
00:38:42,636 --> 00:38:43,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Three-point Whaler lead.

420
00:38:46,559 --> 00:38:50,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Wild shot by Tillman, no good.

421
00:38:50,721 --> 00:38:55,985
[SPEAKER_04]: And a foul as McKelvin was harassed after the rebound.

422
00:38:56,005 --> 00:38:58,486
[SPEAKER_04]: And that foul will go against West Haven.

423
00:38:58,506 --> 00:39:00,448
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the third of the quarter.

424
00:39:00,668 --> 00:39:04,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Tillman, the guilty party of the region after the miss, the frustration.

425
00:39:05,431 --> 00:39:06,411
[SPEAKER_03]: Brian Tillman to the rim.

426
00:39:06,431 --> 00:39:08,593
[SPEAKER_03]: The timing's a bit of a wild shot, out of control.

427
00:39:10,151 --> 00:39:11,332
[SPEAKER_03]: No hoop, but to harm.

428
00:39:12,192 --> 00:39:12,793
[SPEAKER_04]: That's correct.

429
00:39:13,493 --> 00:39:15,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Bidette back in the ball game, giving.

430
00:39:17,396 --> 00:39:18,517
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like Philliston is still in.

431
00:39:18,537 --> 00:39:20,138
[SPEAKER_04]: So Bidette gives McKelvin a breather.

432
00:39:22,919 --> 00:39:24,541
[SPEAKER_04]: And Robinson in as well.

433
00:39:24,641 --> 00:39:25,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Phillips will sit down.

434
00:39:28,423 --> 00:39:31,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Philliston, that's a good idea.

435
00:39:31,065 --> 00:39:32,085
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great idea.

436
00:39:32,126 --> 00:39:36,448
[SPEAKER_04]: He wanted Bidette to cut and pass it before he's open, to where he's going to be open.

437
00:39:36,468 --> 00:39:37,349
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a smart idea.

438
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:38,850
[SPEAKER_04]: The quarterback knew what he was doing.

439
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:44,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Ball's tipped, no backcourt.

440
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:46,978
[SPEAKER_04]: 10 seconds on the shot clock.

441
00:39:47,138 --> 00:39:49,699
[SPEAKER_04]: Warren soars, can't get it to go.

442
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:50,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Rebound.

443
00:39:51,881 --> 00:39:54,783
[SPEAKER_04]: Strong, up high by Morris.

444
00:39:55,883 --> 00:39:58,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Three coming right back the other way by Morris, no good.

445
00:39:59,185 --> 00:40:00,646
[SPEAKER_04]: Hall ahead to Robinson.

446
00:40:00,967 --> 00:40:04,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson turns on the Jets and he's stripped as he heads to the basket.

447
00:40:04,889 --> 00:40:06,150
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like we're going to get a foul.

448
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:21,951
[SPEAKER_04]: And congratulations to Jeff Brown and the NFA Wildcats, who are in the semifinals of Division II after they beat Innovation 56-53.

449
00:40:22,892 --> 00:40:27,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Juice beforehand said, watch the Wildcats.

450
00:40:27,636 --> 00:40:33,001
[SPEAKER_04]: And if the Whalers can do their business tonight, we could have an all-ECC semi, which would be remarkable.

451
00:40:33,121 --> 00:40:41,765
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, you throw the records out this time of year when you get hot and you get a couple of kids believing in themselves and you get rolling on a bit of a mission, you know, tough, tough, stop.

452
00:40:42,306 --> 00:40:47,928
[SPEAKER_04]: It also helps if you get a couple upsets, you know, you can avoid a certain team, get a matchup to get yourself going.

453
00:40:48,328 --> 00:40:49,329
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, they had to win four games.

454
00:40:49,349 --> 00:40:50,830
[SPEAKER_03]: Innovation was number two, right?

455
00:40:50,890 --> 00:40:52,310
[SPEAKER_03]: No, and it's a tough, tough team.

456
00:40:52,430 --> 00:40:56,552
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think you'd, I think you'd choose innovation over this West Haven team that beat NFL by 30.

457
00:40:56,692 --> 00:40:57,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I would think so.

458
00:40:57,913 --> 00:40:59,474
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it has to be a little bit lucky.

459
00:40:59,775 --> 00:41:03,558
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they get New London, New London's going to beat them, try to beat them for the fourth time.

460
00:41:03,638 --> 00:41:05,119
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've been around it the whole time.

461
00:41:05,179 --> 00:41:07,901
[SPEAKER_04]: So hanging around, hanging around, they got alligator blood.

462
00:41:07,961 --> 00:41:08,782
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got to love it.

463
00:41:09,403 --> 00:41:14,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Both free throws made by Robinson puts the lead up to five, the biggest lead of the game for New London.

464
00:41:14,727 --> 00:41:18,690
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Coach Cornish has got to be really pleased with the defensive effort of this team right now.

465
00:41:19,471 --> 00:41:20,772
[SPEAKER_03]: Only allowed 13 points.

466
00:41:20,792 --> 00:41:25,156
[SPEAKER_03]: They're hitting the boards, you know, one and done in the offensive end for West Haven.

467
00:41:26,383 --> 00:41:28,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's in foul trouble right now for New London.

468
00:41:28,824 --> 00:41:32,846
[SPEAKER_03]: He's kind of finding that right recipe, kind of who to sub in and who to take out.

469
00:41:34,707 --> 00:41:36,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Matthew Morgan into the game for West Haven.

470
00:41:36,968 --> 00:41:38,049
[SPEAKER_04]: First time we've seen him.

471
00:41:38,469 --> 00:41:39,890
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm waiting for that wing shooter.

472
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:42,671
[SPEAKER_04]: West Haven has it because that's the shot that's available.

473
00:41:43,192 --> 00:41:45,533
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't had a pure knockdown guy yet.

474
00:41:49,335 --> 00:41:50,675
[SPEAKER_04]: Bellamy passes it off.

475
00:41:51,216 --> 00:41:53,697
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Morgan swinging it around to Morris.

476
00:41:55,267 --> 00:41:59,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Wide open corner, open look three, up and buried by Aaron Johnson.

477
00:41:59,729 --> 00:42:02,770
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnson the rise up, the catch and shoot, the delivery.

478
00:42:03,210 --> 00:42:05,911
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's your corner ball for the three ball for the corner pocket Casey.

479
00:42:06,691 --> 00:42:09,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Wide open corner three, we love those here on game day.

480
00:42:10,973 --> 00:42:14,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Dump down Bidette, soft touch finish, catch, shoot.

481
00:42:15,415 --> 00:42:20,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Well there you go and Savon Warren throwing the ball up high where his big man can get it and no hesitation.

482
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:23,158
[SPEAKER_03]: The turn, the look, the delivery for two.

483
00:42:24,651 --> 00:42:29,355
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you already that Morgan's a shooter because he's running the baseline corner to corner.

484
00:42:29,655 --> 00:42:30,916
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where you bring yourself up.

485
00:42:30,956 --> 00:42:31,277
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

486
00:42:33,338 --> 00:42:35,100
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, they're going to get out here on Johnson.

487
00:42:35,120 --> 00:42:35,860
[SPEAKER_04]: He just shot one.

488
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,921
[SPEAKER_04]: He comes right back again.

489
00:42:37,902 --> 00:42:40,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Aaron Johnson's on fire already.

490
00:42:40,464 --> 00:42:41,445
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a one point lead.

491
00:42:45,548 --> 00:42:47,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Vinnie Johnson, the microwave.

492
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:48,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Instant offense.

493
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:56,662
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, those were rise up contested.

494
00:42:57,403 --> 00:43:04,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Other direction, Savon Warren with a three, no good and it's off West Haven and McKelvin will check back in.

495
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:10,001
[SPEAKER_04]: So 142-35 on the shot clock.

496
00:43:12,183 --> 00:43:19,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Boy, how quickly the tides can turn when you've got a seven point lead or a six point lead and the other team starts knocking them down from behind the arc.

497
00:43:19,765 --> 00:43:26,007
[SPEAKER_04]: And those were, I'd give that, you know, I'd give that, that second one was a contested rise up, you know, square up.

498
00:43:26,087 --> 00:43:28,008
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can't do much better than that.

499
00:43:28,148 --> 00:43:30,489
[SPEAKER_03]: A man in his grill, hand in your face.

500
00:43:31,329 --> 00:43:32,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Johnson's got great length though.

501
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:33,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, he does.

502
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:43,032
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson, to Warren, looking for Baudet on the dump down, back up top.

503
00:43:43,293 --> 00:43:51,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Great job by Bellamy, face guarding Phillips, got number one versus number one, and Dave wants to talk it over in the last minute and a half, and I don't blame him.

504
00:43:52,178 --> 00:43:57,541
[SPEAKER_03]: Phillips right now in the offensive end, even though having a hard time getting himself open, can't a little shake and bake get rid of his guy.

505
00:43:57,962 --> 00:44:00,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Brandon Bellamy, great job on the defensive end right now.

506
00:44:01,622 --> 00:44:05,746
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got semifinal action in division one we know that the St.

507
00:44:05,786 --> 00:44:14,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Bernard Saints after a nice win last night against Staples is in a I mean you can't look at the you look at the D1 semis it is the elite of the elite St.

508
00:44:14,794 --> 00:44:22,922
[SPEAKER_04]: Bernard he's Catholic and Notre Dame Notre Dame no BC in any of the semifinals however two Notre Dames so

509
00:44:25,005 --> 00:44:26,687
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a shot at my right here.

510
00:44:26,727 --> 00:44:27,167
[SPEAKER_03]: He gets it.

511
00:44:27,868 --> 00:44:28,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Division two.

512
00:44:28,548 --> 00:44:31,611
[SPEAKER_04]: We see NFA first ones to get to the semis.

513
00:44:32,532 --> 00:44:33,593
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, division five.

514
00:44:33,613 --> 00:44:35,654
[SPEAKER_04]: We got that great Grasso tech old line.

515
00:44:36,035 --> 00:44:37,816
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they're all got Fitch in the semifinal.

516
00:44:37,836 --> 00:44:39,258
[SPEAKER_04]: Fitch has got a great draw.

517
00:44:39,278 --> 00:44:41,079
[SPEAKER_04]: They got McMahon.

518
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:42,380
[SPEAKER_04]: The ECC has done very well.

519
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:43,501
[SPEAKER_04]: The locals have done very well.

520
00:44:43,521 --> 00:44:47,164
[SPEAKER_04]: But I go, you know, this one right here, you know, give NFA all the credit.

521
00:44:47,445 --> 00:44:51,068
[SPEAKER_04]: This one right here is going to be contested all the way through, I believe.

522
00:44:55,838 --> 00:44:57,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson picks the dribble up now for Phillips.

523
00:44:59,641 --> 00:45:09,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Underneath, Bidet, Pumphrey, harassed, no, his own offensive rebound, no, third chance, no, McKelvin, no, Warren, stripped.

524
00:45:11,592 --> 00:45:13,253
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about six chances for a new arm.

525
00:45:13,273 --> 00:45:14,935
[SPEAKER_04]: Four shots, point blank range.

526
00:45:17,644 --> 00:45:21,467
[SPEAKER_04]: Warren loses it, finds McKelvin, he's harassed.

527
00:45:21,787 --> 00:45:23,308
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to Warren, can't handle it.

528
00:45:23,649 --> 00:45:28,873
[SPEAKER_04]: Rise up jumper, and finally, after about shot seven, the Whalers are up three.

529
00:45:28,893 --> 00:45:32,155
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a term this time of year we call it either win ugly or lose pretty.

530
00:45:32,576 --> 00:45:33,697
[SPEAKER_03]: That's win and ugly right there.

531
00:45:33,797 --> 00:45:35,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Five knocks at the rim.

532
00:45:35,178 --> 00:45:36,539
[SPEAKER_03]: It's also win in advance, right?

533
00:45:36,619 --> 00:45:37,880
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, survive in advance.

534
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:39,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Survive in advance.

535
00:45:40,001 --> 00:45:43,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, three point lead for the Whalers.

536
00:45:44,565 --> 00:45:47,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Eight second difference between the shot clock and the game clock.

537
00:45:49,495 --> 00:45:51,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Three, up, no good, back iron.

538
00:45:52,516 --> 00:45:53,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Phillips with a high rebound.

539
00:45:53,757 --> 00:45:56,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Whalers can get the last shot of the quarter if they want it.

540
00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:00,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson with a three, no good.

541
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:04,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Warren finds Bedette, put back, no good.

542
00:46:05,061 --> 00:46:05,941
[SPEAKER_04]: Out of bounds with 6.8.

543
00:46:06,502 --> 00:46:10,063
[SPEAKER_04]: The Whalers will have it with 6.8 seconds.

544
00:46:14,725 --> 00:46:17,286
[SPEAKER_04]: Whalers got a break and they just can't finish around the rim right now.

545
00:46:18,847 --> 00:46:21,990
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson will take a break here with the last 6.8 seconds.

546
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:23,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Hall comes in for him.

547
00:46:25,433 --> 00:46:26,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Hall will inbound.

548
00:46:31,819 --> 00:46:32,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Dumps down to Warren.

549
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:34,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Warren, pump fake, kicks back.

550
00:46:35,222 --> 00:46:36,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Hall for three, good!

551
00:46:37,924 --> 00:46:38,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh boy!

552
00:46:40,241 --> 00:46:43,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Jameer Hall with a big three at the end of the quarter.

553
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:47,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Dave Cornish is all kinds of fired up.

554
00:46:47,784 --> 00:46:53,306
[SPEAKER_04]: He is thrilled the Whalers have a six point lead and he is going to talk to the sports doctor in a moment.

555
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:58,888
[SPEAKER_04]: What a big shot but he goes over first to Jameer Hall and says great job knocking it down.

556
00:46:58,968 --> 00:47:00,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Sports doctors with coach Cornish.

557
00:47:02,023 --> 00:47:04,544
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave, a big lift on your haul for a corner three.

558
00:47:05,024 --> 00:47:06,685
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk about the defensive end though.

559
00:47:06,725 --> 00:47:08,926
[SPEAKER_03]: You held that good team to 19 points in the first half.

560
00:47:09,326 --> 00:47:15,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but we lost Aaron on two corner threes down here.

561
00:47:15,309 --> 00:47:16,829
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a little disappointed about that.

562
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:18,890
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, we've been playing pretty good.

563
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:24,353
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have been giving yourselves second, third, fourth chance scoring opportunities on the offensive end.

564
00:47:24,813 --> 00:47:26,854
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could convert a few more of those tonight, Dave.

565
00:47:27,514 --> 00:47:28,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, we've done that all year.

566
00:47:28,975 --> 00:47:30,436
[SPEAKER_02]: We've hit the offensive glass.

567
00:47:30,896 --> 00:47:33,819
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we can continue to do that, hopefully we don't need to do that.

568
00:47:33,879 --> 00:47:36,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we can make the shot and we don't need to hit the offensive side.

569
00:47:36,841 --> 00:47:37,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Good luck in the second half, coach.

570
00:47:39,403 --> 00:47:40,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're at halftime.

571
00:47:40,523 --> 00:47:42,305
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wailers with a six-point lead.

572
00:47:42,365 --> 00:47:46,208
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be coming back with the second half after some video action and highlights.

573
00:47:46,228 --> 00:47:48,069
[SPEAKER_04]: You're watching Game Day live on theday.com.

574
00:47:48,429 --> 00:47:53,293
[SPEAKER_04]: It's time for the athletes of the future, grading plays of the week.

575
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:57,617
[SPEAKER_04]: At number eight, Carmelo Sylvester.

576
00:47:58,217 --> 00:48:02,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Benny Dover Jackson Middle School against Clark Lane.

577
00:48:02,378 --> 00:48:03,699
[SPEAKER_04]: The long three.

578
00:48:04,179 --> 00:48:05,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Bank it in, Mello.

579
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:09,240
[SPEAKER_04]: At number seven, Asia Harris.

580
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,560
[SPEAKER_04]: Wind of basketball.

581
00:48:10,781 --> 00:48:15,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at the hands, the steel, all the way to the basket and one.

582
00:48:15,962 --> 00:48:19,283
[SPEAKER_04]: Whippets win the ECC D2 Championship.

583
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:26,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Harris was a menace with speed all the way to the hoop.

584
00:48:26,802 --> 00:48:31,463
[SPEAKER_04]: At number six, Aria Leonard brought in middle school basketball.

585
00:48:31,483 --> 00:48:37,586
[SPEAKER_04]: The third grader, she wants to be like Harris, steal off to the races and the basket.

586
00:48:38,646 --> 00:48:43,628
[SPEAKER_04]: At number five, congratulations Griswold Basketball's Abby Matheson.

587
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:46,229
[SPEAKER_04]: A thousand career points.

588
00:48:46,889 --> 00:48:48,030
[SPEAKER_04]: Great job, Abby.

589
00:48:49,588 --> 00:48:52,529
[SPEAKER_04]: At number four, Fitch Basketball's Luke Wenger.

590
00:48:53,289 --> 00:48:55,510
[SPEAKER_04]: The opening round win over Amistad.

591
00:48:56,510 --> 00:49:02,272
[SPEAKER_04]: A little stutter step, dipsy do, and oh, the English off the side of the glass.

592
00:49:03,972 --> 00:49:07,293
[SPEAKER_04]: At number three, Keon Simillion.

593
00:49:08,133 --> 00:49:16,456
[SPEAKER_04]: Teacher's global magnet middle, with a 360 layup, dare I say, scintillating.

594
00:49:17,667 --> 00:49:24,093
[SPEAKER_04]: At number two, Maddie Ives, bacon basketball back to the basket, the wild shot.

595
00:49:24,613 --> 00:49:29,438
[SPEAKER_04]: Bobcats win the D1 championship thanks to plays like that from Ives.

596
00:49:29,498 --> 00:49:34,402
[SPEAKER_04]: But at number one, for a week of free training at Athletes of the Future,

597
00:49:35,183 --> 00:49:36,043

[SPEAKER_04]: 100 free.

[SPEAKER_04]: 9 hundredths of a second.

601
00:49:43,025 --> 00:49:45,786
[SPEAKER_04]: He gets rival Eduardo Marcos.

602
00:49:46,426 --> 00:49:47,387
[SPEAKER_04]: And look at the face.

603
00:49:47,907 --> 00:49:48,947
[SPEAKER_04]: It says it all.

604
00:49:49,327 --> 00:49:51,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Sterling, you won.

605
00:49:51,908 --> 00:49:54,549
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get a free week of training at AOF.

606
00:49:55,209 --> 00:49:58,090
[SPEAKER_04]: That is your Grade 8 Play of the Week.

607
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:01,331
[SPEAKER_04]: And those are your Grade 8 Plays.

608
00:50:02,051 --> 00:50:04,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Send in your plays and maybe you can make next week's Grade 8.

609
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:14,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Long shot up and oh, knocking it down, Henry Lloyd from downtown.

610
00:50:16,104 --> 00:50:18,425
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to get to the basket, weaving his way through.

611
00:50:18,805 --> 00:50:24,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Jump shot, oh swish, buried by Noah Schaefer.

612
00:50:27,409 --> 00:50:30,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Fast break opportunity, nothing but net.

613
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:31,811
[SPEAKER_04]: Splash for Bowden.

614
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:36,553
[SPEAKER_04]: Good pass underneath.

615
00:50:38,055 --> 00:50:44,839
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice shot by DeVille, high, Archer.

616
00:50:44,979 --> 00:50:47,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Weaving through traffic, Sean Morrison off the glass.

617
00:50:49,181 --> 00:50:52,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the rebound back to Redmond, off the glass it's good.

618
00:50:54,964 --> 00:50:56,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Only a sophomore, Damian Redmond.

619
00:50:57,005 --> 00:51:00,307
[SPEAKER_04]: DeFelice all the way to the basket and knocks it down.

620
00:51:01,967 --> 00:51:02,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Sam.

621
00:51:05,829 --> 00:51:06,410
[SPEAKER_04]: That's Wes.

622
00:51:09,671 --> 00:51:11,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Not bad, good shot by West.

623
00:51:13,773 --> 00:51:15,594
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy inside has been unstoppable.

624
00:51:16,154 --> 00:51:18,816
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't stop Taylor Herbert.

625
00:51:19,396 --> 00:51:22,538
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he's going to sprint back on D, which is the best part of it all.

626
00:51:22,618 --> 00:51:24,038
[SPEAKER_04]: First guy back on defense.

627
00:51:26,299 --> 00:51:31,182
[SPEAKER_04]: And bang, knocking it down from long range is Zab.

628
00:51:32,583 --> 00:51:33,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Great shot.

629
00:51:37,416 --> 00:51:42,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Reverse layup is good from our guy Jacob Sachs.

630
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:46,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice basket from Colby.

631
00:51:46,521 --> 00:51:47,861
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, good left hand.

632
00:51:52,384 --> 00:51:53,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Up ahead to Duda.

633
00:51:53,424 --> 00:51:54,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Duda, bounce pass.

634
00:51:55,425 --> 00:51:58,187
[SPEAKER_04]: Jump shot is knocked down.

635
00:51:58,807 --> 00:52:00,988
[SPEAKER_04]: That was by Jojo Rivera.

636
00:52:03,230 --> 00:52:03,690
[SPEAKER_04]: Fatima.

637
00:52:04,901 --> 00:52:05,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Swish.

638
00:52:05,661 --> 00:52:07,322
[SPEAKER_04]: Buckets for team Amalo.

639
00:52:10,624 --> 00:52:12,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Warren floats and scores.

640
00:52:13,546 --> 00:52:16,047
[SPEAKER_04]: No one's better at scoring than Warren and Soren.

641
00:52:17,468 --> 00:52:18,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Offensive rebounds.

642
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:22,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice look from Robinson to Bedette underneath for the easy two.

643
00:52:23,971 --> 00:52:25,432
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson finds McKelvin.

644
00:52:25,712 --> 00:52:28,554
[SPEAKER_04]: Left hand, basket is good and the foul.

645
00:52:28,814 --> 00:52:30,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Troy McKelvin Jr.

646
00:52:33,216 --> 00:52:34,157
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice look underneath.

647
00:52:35,196 --> 00:52:46,524
[SPEAKER_04]: and a foul on Warren, and that'll be his second foul as Raekwon Anderson, but he gets his offensive rebound on the tip, underneath, beautiful look to Washington.

648
00:52:47,005 --> 00:52:48,706
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the game of Raekwon Anderson.

649
00:52:49,387 --> 00:52:51,928
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually produce long rebounds, the Whalers have to know that.

650
00:52:52,329 --> 00:53:00,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Lazy pass from Hall in the other direction, Washington finishes in the timeout, Dave Cornish, because he knows his team should be up more than five.

651
00:53:02,997 --> 00:53:05,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Phillips all the way, left hand is good and the foul.

652
00:53:07,899 --> 00:53:08,959
[SPEAKER_04]: He figures it out.

653
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:10,980
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson, great look to Baudette.

654
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,261
[SPEAKER_04]: Jackson Baudette is rapidly becoming my favorite player.

655
00:53:15,081 --> 00:53:16,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Baudette with a rebound.

656
00:53:17,122 --> 00:53:20,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Ahead to Warren, finds Robinson, puts it on the floor.

657
00:53:20,523 --> 00:53:22,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice patience by J.J.

658
00:53:22,864 --> 00:53:25,024
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson, the lead is up to nine.

659
00:53:25,465 --> 00:53:26,705
[SPEAKER_04]: Five point second quarter.

660
00:53:27,702 --> 00:53:30,824
[SPEAKER_04]: JJ, all the way to the basket, and the foul.

661
00:53:31,284 --> 00:53:34,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson draws the foul on Kinsey, he'll go to the line.

662
00:53:34,746 --> 00:53:38,949
[SPEAKER_04]: This game, they have to take care of the ball and get defensive rebounds.

663
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:41,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Phillips, all the way to the basket.

664
00:53:42,471 --> 00:53:44,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Boo-boo for two.

665
00:53:44,953 --> 00:53:46,193
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's a combination of both.

666
00:53:47,014 --> 00:53:48,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson finds Warrant.

667
00:53:49,015 --> 00:53:50,816
[SPEAKER_04]: Easy basket and transition for the Whalers.

668
00:53:50,916 --> 00:53:52,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Crosby just fell asleep there.

669
00:53:53,458 --> 00:53:56,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job of getting back, setting up the zone.

670
00:53:57,283 --> 00:53:59,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Three shot and buried by Kinsey.

671
00:54:00,245 --> 00:54:04,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to back makes from three for Crosby, has it down to six.

672
00:54:04,849 --> 00:54:06,570
[SPEAKER_04]: And then a turnover on a high pass.

673
00:54:07,050 --> 00:54:08,592
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson attacks.

674
00:54:09,112 --> 00:54:11,474
[SPEAKER_04]: Wild shot is good and a foul.

675
00:54:11,754 --> 00:54:13,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey hey JJ.

676
00:54:14,816 --> 00:54:16,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Consider the way they're shooting the three.

677
00:54:17,518 --> 00:54:18,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Bidet with the block.

678
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,121
[SPEAKER_04]: Warren ahead to Phillips.

679
00:54:21,501 --> 00:54:23,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Phillips all the way to the basket.

680
00:54:23,783 --> 00:54:25,985
[SPEAKER_04]: And Boo Boo scores and gets the lead back up to eight.

681
00:54:27,232 --> 00:54:28,293
[SPEAKER_04]: And they survive.

682
00:54:29,033 --> 00:54:29,673
[SPEAKER_04]: They advance.

683
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:32,815
[SPEAKER_00]: Quarterfinals, Friday night here at Conway.

684
00:54:35,537 --> 00:54:40,539
[SPEAKER_00]: It took about two hours for Northwestern Regional to make the bus trip from Winstead to Stonington.

685
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:48,944
[SPEAKER_00]: But it took Maddie Topa three seconds to score the first points in Thursday's class-M quarterfinal.

686
00:54:48,964 --> 00:54:56,148
[SPEAKER_00]: The 2,000-point score lit it up early for the Highlanders with 14 first-half points, a nice assist to Emma Maltby.

687
00:55:01,881 --> 00:55:05,923
[SPEAKER_00]: Mackenzie Janko finds Topa on the inbound, Northwestern is up 8.

688
00:55:06,063 --> 00:55:13,526
[SPEAKER_00]: But Sophia Hawinski causing big problems in the paint, she would also score 14 in the first half.

689
00:55:15,327 --> 00:55:19,589
[SPEAKER_00]: Leah DiPeri, the long outlet to Adeline Risley, bears within one.

690
00:55:19,609 --> 00:55:25,152
[SPEAKER_00]: And Kaitlyn Cadness with a steal in the contested layup to give Stonington the lead.

691
00:55:29,309 --> 00:55:33,952
[SPEAKER_00]: Topa with a dish to Kylie Stapleton, put the Hilltoppers back on top.

692
00:55:33,972 --> 00:55:37,835
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hwinski almost unstoppable in the post.

693
00:55:37,855 --> 00:55:41,057
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bears take a 28-27 lead into halftime.

694
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:48,843
[SPEAKER_00]: Three-pointer by Cadmus makes the lead four early in the third.

695
00:55:50,424 --> 00:55:52,966
[SPEAKER_00]: Two quick baskets from Topa and the game is tied 33-33.

696
00:55:56,214 --> 00:55:59,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Stonington though would finish the quarter with 12 straight points.

697
00:55:59,595 --> 00:56:04,237
[SPEAKER_00]: Callie Mansfield to Cadmus for the reverse layup there by nine.

698
00:56:05,357 --> 00:56:08,338
[SPEAKER_00]: And Cadmus gets her own rebound, fights for the putback.

699
00:56:08,858 --> 00:56:10,419
[SPEAKER_00]: Bears lead 50 to 37 after three.

700
00:56:13,900 --> 00:56:20,822
[SPEAKER_00]: Northwestern working to shut down Hawinski with two and three defenders, but she finds Rory Wisley for the easy layup in the fourth.

701
00:56:20,922 --> 00:56:23,183
[SPEAKER_00]: Wisley would finish with 11, Hawinski with 20.

702
00:56:24,710 --> 00:56:29,793
[SPEAKER_00]: And DiPeri, long pass to Cadmus, 19 points on the night for her and the lead is 15.

703
00:56:32,976 --> 00:56:37,098
[SPEAKER_00]: Topa would pour in 35 points in the game, but it was not enough.

704
00:56:38,039 --> 00:56:42,762
[SPEAKER_00]: DiPeri breaks the late pressure and finds Adeline Risley to make it 61-50.

705
00:56:45,744 --> 00:56:47,605
[SPEAKER_00]: Bears go on to win 67-54.

706
00:56:47,625 --> 00:56:51,528
[SPEAKER_00]: They will face ECC rival Wyndham in the semifinals on Monday.

707
00:56:57,927 --> 00:57:03,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Gonna start the second half with a six-point Whaler lead, and the second half possession is brought to you by Kuchar Financial.

708
00:57:03,792 --> 00:57:12,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Located in New London, Kuchar Financial will help you keep possession of your money through sound financial planning and investment, tax planning and preparation, whether you're an individual or a small business.

709
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:16,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone wants to feel better about their finances, so go see Lee Kuchar.

710
00:57:16,623 --> 00:57:18,925
[SPEAKER_04]: At Kuchar Financial, let him make you feel more confident.

711
00:57:19,305 --> 00:57:21,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Whalers with the opening possession of the second half.

712
00:57:21,167 --> 00:57:22,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, big three by Hall.

713
00:57:22,508 --> 00:57:24,990
[SPEAKER_03]: Casey to give him a six-point lead going into the locker room.

714
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:29,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Robinson and McKelvin leading the way with six apiece for the Wailers.

715
00:57:29,393 --> 00:57:33,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson in and out on a spot up three, Baudette lost the rebound and Westhaven's gonna run.

716
00:57:33,657 --> 00:57:37,340
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's gonna be the word coming out of the locker room is for them to push.

717
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:38,801
[SPEAKER_04]: Phillips with a blocked shot.

718
00:57:45,266 --> 00:57:47,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Again though that three was halfway down.

719
00:57:50,010 --> 00:57:53,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Inside the challenge and the soft roll for Kanan Morris.

720
00:57:55,606 --> 00:57:58,147
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll keep an eye on Deshaun Phillips here in the second half.

721
00:57:58,187 --> 00:57:58,987
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a senior.

722
00:58:00,048 --> 00:58:01,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Two points in the first half.

723
00:58:04,909 --> 00:58:06,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Check that, four points in the first half.

724
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:08,771
[SPEAKER_04]: Warren for three, in and out.

725
00:58:09,911 --> 00:58:11,111
[SPEAKER_04]: Right into Baudette's hands though.

726
00:58:15,333 --> 00:58:17,314
[SPEAKER_04]: Jump ball, possession arrow goes to West Ham.

727
00:58:19,494 --> 00:58:21,115
[SPEAKER_04]: So two early threes from New London.

728
00:58:21,135 --> 00:58:24,156
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why we've come out of the gates

729
00:58:24,958 --> 00:58:31,679
[SPEAKER_04]: thinking that they were going to run a different offense but we were we were saying how they had to get it inside work guys two threes.

730
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:39,921
[SPEAKER_04]: West Haven's made the commitment to get the ball inside you can see it already they're going to challenge New London's bigs.

731
00:58:43,102 --> 00:58:48,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Wild shot no good offensive rebound on the floor West Haven now

732
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:56,888
[SPEAKER_04]: challenge but the basket by Ogletree and just like that West Haven's cut the lead to two.

733
00:58:56,908 --> 00:59:01,033
[SPEAKER_04]: 4-0 run all from inside to paint all at the rim for West Haven.

734
00:59:02,314 --> 00:59:05,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson in the corner to Warren that's the shot they will give.

735
00:59:05,118 --> 00:59:06,980
[SPEAKER_03]: They're gonna give it to him too this sag off him.

736
00:59:14,418 --> 00:59:16,159
[SPEAKER_04]: McKelvin flashes, but nothing there.

737
00:59:16,299 --> 00:59:19,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Bidet pulls up from about 10 feet, no good.

738
00:59:19,682 --> 00:59:21,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Ball tipped on the floor.

739
00:59:22,063 --> 00:59:23,344
[SPEAKER_04]: West Haven's got numbers.

740
00:59:24,845 --> 00:59:28,268
[SPEAKER_04]: And oh, what a block by Boo Boo Phillips.

741
00:59:28,348 --> 00:59:33,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Big time on a defensive end, number one squaring things up, sending it back.

742
00:59:34,652 --> 00:59:38,075
[SPEAKER_03]: Phillips saw that coming the whole way in front of him and timed his jump perfectly.

743
00:59:38,315 --> 00:59:38,695
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an ouchie.

744
00:59:38,715 --> 00:59:40,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this right here, boom, get out of here.

745
00:59:42,620 --> 00:59:46,222
[SPEAKER_04]: Hall into the game for New London after knocking down that three at the end of the half.

746
00:59:46,242 --> 00:59:49,583
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see if they're going to run some things through him.

747
00:59:53,285 --> 00:59:57,667
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a small little play like that at defensive end it kind of welcomes Phillips into the game a little bit too.

748
00:59:57,687 --> 01:00:02,309
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't like the second half start for either team.

749
01:00:02,769 --> 01:00:04,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I love what West Haven's trying to do.

750
01:00:05,931 --> 01:00:10,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Miss there in the lane but they've made a commitment to get the ball to the big man down low.

751
01:00:11,537 --> 01:00:14,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Get to the rim, create some easy scoring opportunities.

752
01:00:15,518 --> 01:00:19,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Phillips gets a step, drives, hangs, and an offensive foul.

753
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:21,500
[SPEAKER_04]: And saw that coming a mile away.

754
01:00:21,601 --> 01:00:23,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Great job, Kanan Morris.

755
01:00:23,721 --> 01:00:25,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Morris holding his ground.

756
01:00:25,762 --> 01:00:27,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Phillips coming right down the pipe.

757
01:00:28,383 --> 01:00:30,244
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job by Morris on the defensive end.

758
01:00:30,264 --> 01:00:36,446
[SPEAKER_03]: 4-0 run out of the chute.

759
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:39,807
[SPEAKER_03]: Second foul on Phillips for West Haven.

760
01:00:48,260 --> 01:00:50,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Tillman has a mismatch with Baudet on him.

761
01:00:53,783 --> 01:00:54,784
[SPEAKER_04]: All the way to the basket.

762
01:00:54,804 --> 01:00:57,686
[SPEAKER_03]: That could take Ty Little, yeah.

763
01:00:57,966 --> 01:01:03,089
[SPEAKER_03]: He took the bump, the finish, the hoop, and just like that, 6-0 run.

764
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:06,751
[SPEAKER_03]: We're tied at 25.

765
01:01:11,614 --> 01:01:13,695
[SPEAKER_04]: Tillman harassing Robinson.

766
01:01:17,115 --> 01:01:20,299
[SPEAKER_03]: How quickly your lead evaporates when you're not converting on the offensive end.

767
01:01:21,120 --> 01:01:22,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Westhaven's made some adjustments.

768
01:01:23,002 --> 01:01:24,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything right now is close by the rim.

769
01:01:26,566 --> 01:01:28,548
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson, stutter step, finds McKelvin.

770
01:01:28,588 --> 01:01:30,771
[SPEAKER_04]: McKelvin, short jumper, no good.

771
01:01:31,171 --> 01:01:32,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Phillips with the offensive rebound.

772
01:01:32,673 --> 01:01:33,394
[SPEAKER_04]: He draws the foul.

773
01:01:36,604 --> 01:01:42,488
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, one thing, too, without Amir Hall available to them, and he hasn't been in the game, which makes me feel like he may not be available.

774
01:01:43,048 --> 01:01:45,670
[SPEAKER_04]: They really don't have a lights-out three-point shoot.

775
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:46,050
[SPEAKER_04]: They do not.

776
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:49,332
[SPEAKER_04]: And if he was on the floor, that would extend that zone just enough.

777
01:01:49,372 --> 01:01:51,153
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now, they don't have to come out on anybody.

778
01:01:51,293 --> 01:01:57,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, whether it's Jameer in the game, and Gaskin showed you some flashes early, but couldn't knock one down.

779
01:01:58,038 --> 01:02:00,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Savon Warren's been a little helter-skelter from the three-point line.

780
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:04,321
[SPEAKER_03]: No real offensive threat from behind the arc.

781
01:02:04,361 --> 01:02:06,943
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think Phillips is going to have to be that guy to get things moving.

782
01:02:07,023 --> 01:02:08,003
[SPEAKER_04]: They've knocked down one three.

783
01:02:08,103 --> 01:02:09,364
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was the Hall three at the end of the half.

784
01:02:12,205 --> 01:02:12,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Free throws.

785
01:02:13,386 --> 01:02:13,966
[SPEAKER_04]: One of two.

786
01:02:14,086 --> 01:02:14,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Lead is one.

787
01:02:14,967 --> 01:02:15,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Pressure.

788
01:02:18,049 --> 01:02:20,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Great trap that time by McKelvin and Phillips.

789
01:02:21,370 --> 01:02:22,771
[SPEAKER_03]: And a timeout by Westhaven.

790
01:02:23,191 --> 01:02:29,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Timeout Westhaven, as Ty Sullivan wants to talk it over because this guy was in a dangerous position, trapped in the corner.

791
01:02:31,132 --> 01:02:33,316
[SPEAKER_04]: 30 second timeout, so we'll keep it here.

792
01:02:33,697 --> 01:02:37,925
[SPEAKER_03]: New London's gonna go right into the trap, Casey, after a make or after a free throw.

793
01:02:38,386 --> 01:02:42,494
[SPEAKER_03]: And a great job that time by McKelvin and Phillips, getting West Haven pinned in.

794
01:02:45,835 --> 01:02:53,778
[SPEAKER_03]: So the second half of this game, though, it seems like West Haven has kind of come out and made some sort of adjustment.

795
01:02:54,238 --> 01:02:58,659
[SPEAKER_03]: On the offensive end, whether it's get the ball to the rack, get yourself some easy opportunities.

796
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:01,040
[SPEAKER_03]: And the London came out firing a three ball.

797
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:09,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think what Westhaven said, if I could guess, was we're going to up the offensive tempo.

798
01:03:09,364 --> 01:03:15,647
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to move the ball better offensively and we're going to make a commitment to getting it in the paint towards the bigs.

799
01:03:16,067 --> 01:03:21,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Defensively, Westhaven said, we're going to sag and give them all the three, bait them.

800
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:28,374
[SPEAKER_04]: And then to their credit, New London missed some threes and that helps Westhaven get out and push, which is what they're trying to do.

801
01:03:31,823 --> 01:03:34,184
[SPEAKER_04]: Pressure by New London.

802
01:03:37,006 --> 01:03:38,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Sort of the soft 2-3.

803
01:03:41,028 --> 01:03:42,049
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll drop back in.

804
01:03:45,891 --> 01:03:49,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Turnover as Roman hit the floor.

805
01:03:49,693 --> 01:03:51,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson finds Phillips.

806
01:03:51,554 --> 01:03:53,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Couple of pump fakes and boo-boo for two.

807
01:03:53,835 --> 01:03:57,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, run on the floor that time and Robinson with a little handoff delivery to Phillips.

808
01:03:58,037 --> 01:03:58,778
[SPEAKER_03]: Phillips converting.

809
01:04:00,355 --> 01:04:01,957
[SPEAKER_04]: And right into the pressure comes New London.

810
01:04:02,238 --> 01:04:03,399
[SPEAKER_04]: They got Johnson trapped.

811
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:04,601
[SPEAKER_04]: He finds his man underneath.

812
01:04:04,681 --> 01:04:05,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Bidet's behind.

813
01:04:06,483 --> 01:04:08,286
[SPEAKER_04]: And a soft touch, though, goes down.

814
01:04:08,706 --> 01:04:12,371
[SPEAKER_04]: Kane and Morris keeps getting those nice bounces like he's a New London guy.

815
01:04:12,992 --> 01:04:13,533
[SPEAKER_04]: The home rim.

816
01:04:13,593 --> 01:04:14,414
[SPEAKER_04]: The friendly rim.

817
01:04:19,589 --> 01:04:24,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Phillips pulls up in the traffic, finds Baudette, and there's a nice look and a nice finish.

818
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:26,575
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I like the way Baudette makes himself available.

819
01:04:26,695 --> 01:04:31,980
[SPEAKER_03]: He shows, he seals his man off at the back end and a turnover here for New London, possibly.

820
01:04:32,801 --> 01:04:33,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Can he save it?

821
01:04:33,561 --> 01:04:34,062
[SPEAKER_04]: He does.

822
01:04:34,142 --> 01:04:35,263
[SPEAKER_04]: But who's going to get it?

823
01:04:35,603 --> 01:04:36,604
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a greased pig.

824
01:04:37,044 --> 01:04:39,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally, it comes down and way ahead.

825
01:04:40,848 --> 01:04:42,749
[SPEAKER_04]: And finishing is Aaron Johnson.

826
01:04:42,769 --> 01:04:44,050
[SPEAKER_04]: So a little bit of bad luck there.

827
01:04:44,391 --> 01:04:45,672
[SPEAKER_04]: New London went from turnover

828
01:04:47,447 --> 01:04:48,028
[SPEAKER_04]: And Baudette!

829
01:04:48,908 --> 01:04:49,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh!

830
01:04:49,669 --> 01:04:51,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Jackson Baudette!

831
01:04:52,451 --> 01:04:54,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that Cajun for Thunder?

832
01:04:55,794 --> 01:04:58,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Right back on the wheel is the Jims Alive.

833
01:05:05,402 --> 01:05:06,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Other direction.

834
01:05:06,082 --> 01:05:07,363
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, how did that go down?

835
01:05:07,543 --> 01:05:08,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Shot little.

836
01:05:08,564 --> 01:05:11,146
[SPEAKER_04]: Sha'Kai Little played big.

837
01:05:13,708 --> 01:05:15,610
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're starting to warm it up a little bit.

838
01:05:22,861 --> 01:05:25,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Baudette from the free throw line, no good.

839
01:05:25,721 --> 01:05:26,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Tipped by Robinson.

840
01:05:27,102 --> 01:05:28,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson gets the rebound.

841
01:05:30,242 --> 01:05:33,463
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're gonna get a foul, which a good call on Tillman.

842
01:05:33,603 --> 01:05:36,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and Robinson does a great job selling it.

843
01:05:37,443 --> 01:05:41,184
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we see it in the NBA all the time with the head bob and the arms going up in the air.

844
01:05:41,644 --> 01:05:44,965
[SPEAKER_03]: It could have been a held ball, but Robinson sells that so well.

845
01:05:45,905 --> 01:05:47,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaskin into the game from McKelvin.

846
01:05:49,726 --> 01:05:52,226
[SPEAKER_04]: McKelvin is reaching for his calf.

847
01:05:53,135 --> 01:05:54,976
[SPEAKER_04]: I think maybe a little cramp action, he's gonna see the trainer.

848
01:06:00,260 --> 01:06:01,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson will inbound.

849
01:06:01,340 --> 01:06:07,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Officials get together.

850
01:06:14,449 --> 01:06:16,590
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing there, so they go high to Gaskin.

851
01:06:18,771 --> 01:06:19,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Phillips.

852
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:21,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Drives to the middle.

853
01:06:21,834 --> 01:06:23,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Hall, spot up three.

854
01:06:23,515 --> 01:06:25,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it!

855
01:06:25,535 --> 01:06:28,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Jameer Hall, two for two from behind the arc.

856
01:06:28,856 --> 01:06:30,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Big time delivery in the stroke.

857
01:06:31,357 --> 01:06:33,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Phillips with the recognition, kick out to the wing.

858
01:06:33,997 --> 01:06:36,418
[SPEAKER_03]: And here comes London, on the turnover case.

859
01:06:36,578 --> 01:06:40,819
[SPEAKER_04]: Hands from Hall, and Gaskins wisely gave it up.

860
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:43,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Phillips inside, no good.

861
01:06:43,840 --> 01:06:47,061
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaskins tips it to Baudette, and Baudette's gonna draw the foul.

862
01:06:48,301 --> 01:06:52,883
[SPEAKER_04]: and Johnson's down on the floor as he landed hard, but a good sequence for the Wailers.

863
01:06:52,923 --> 01:06:57,265
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, last couple trips to New London, creating offense off of a second chance scoring opportunity.

864
01:06:57,545 --> 01:07:06,349
[SPEAKER_03]: You saw Robinson get in the mix, this time you see Phillips getting in, keeping the ball alive on the second chance opportunity, and Bourdette, Johnny on the spot once again for New London.

865
01:07:06,429 --> 01:07:08,049
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Ogletree, he's up.

866
01:07:09,150 --> 01:07:14,172
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize, it was not Aaron Johnson, it was Tyrone Ogletree, but he's up and he's okay, and Baudette will shoot too.

867
01:07:14,592 --> 01:07:16,673
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, in the Crosby game, I said Jameer Hall

868
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:34,487
[SPEAKER_04]: was playing like it was just one click he was one click off you know I mean he was a little too fast a little too slow couldn't quite get this game he has been locked in and quite frankly New London would not be where they are right now without the play of Jameer Hall that was his slap away that led to these two free throws for Bidet.

869
01:07:34,607 --> 01:07:42,751
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to be ready when your number is called when you're coming off the bench to be productive and knock down shots and Jameer Hall calmly has done that.

870
01:07:45,403 --> 01:07:48,847
[SPEAKER_04]: One more free throw for Jackson, Baudette, the Whaler lead is back to five.

871
01:07:55,814 --> 01:07:56,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Smooth, isn't he?

872
01:07:57,436 --> 01:08:01,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Knocks him both down, lead six, Whaler staying a little bit of pressure.

873
01:08:04,715 --> 01:08:15,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Tillman the savvy guard though Little into the corner now Ogletree back up top Hall almost had the steal but Little just rose up above him and then we're gonna get a touch foul out on the perimeter.

874
01:08:16,020 --> 01:08:27,024
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheapie out there by Gaskin you know he kind of lets his man turn the corner gets a little too handsy but that's a dangerous pass coming back with Hall challenging it by Westhaven.

875
01:08:31,166 --> 01:08:33,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Inbounding from the far side now will be Tillman

876
01:08:35,067 --> 01:08:39,468
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna get Matthew Morgan back into the ballgame for Westhaven.

877
01:08:41,889 --> 01:08:42,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Ogletree will have a seat.

878
01:08:47,351 --> 01:08:50,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I like this lineup in there right now for New London, giving them a spark.

879
01:08:52,272 --> 01:08:55,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Little mismatch, Tillman had Bidette beat.

880
01:08:57,014 --> 01:08:58,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Bidette recovered though nicely.

881
01:08:59,175 --> 01:09:03,056
[SPEAKER_04]: Now Tillman will spot up for a three, no good, Bidette gets the rebound.

882
01:09:04,737 --> 01:09:07,200
[SPEAKER_04]: McKelvin trying to walk off a little leg strength.

883
01:09:08,261 --> 01:09:13,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Hall all the way to the basket, finds Baudette and he can't get it to go down because he wasn't ready for the pass.

884
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:14,088
[SPEAKER_04]: No he was not.

885
01:09:18,153 --> 01:09:20,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Morgan for three, no good.

886
01:09:23,319 --> 01:09:24,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Offensive rebound.

887
01:09:25,252 --> 01:09:33,458
[SPEAKER_04]: and getting to the basket and causing a foul is Kanan Morris, he'll shoot two, and Morris has been spectacular for West Haven every time they've needed a big play.

888
01:09:33,498 --> 01:09:47,167
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's been a lunch pail guy, Casey, on the offensive glass, second chance scoring opportunities, the turn and face and a couple of jump shots, but just a guy that's gonna do some dirty work in there and create some opportunities by hustle, you see it here.

889
01:09:47,627 --> 01:09:51,730
[SPEAKER_03]: Morris, again, to lean in that time, drawing the contact from Baudette.

890
01:09:52,330 --> 01:09:55,572
[SPEAKER_03]: You know and how many times stick to the London coaches are over there saying move your feet.

891
01:09:55,892 --> 01:09:59,654
[SPEAKER_03]: You know if Gaskin picks up a foul on the outside with his hands, move your feet, move your feet son.

892
01:10:01,655 --> 01:10:03,896
[SPEAKER_04]: Two shots for Kane and Morris.

893
01:10:04,457 --> 01:10:05,377
[SPEAKER_03]: First one is no good.

894
01:10:07,278 --> 01:10:08,199
[SPEAKER_03]: This lead is six.

895
01:10:08,239 --> 01:10:09,820
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what it was going into the locker room.

896
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,421
[SPEAKER_03]: So the London's kind of right of the ship here in the third quarter.

897
01:10:13,702 --> 01:10:17,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Watching McKelvin right in front of us trying to run off a little bit of a leg strain.

898
01:10:17,264 --> 01:10:17,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

899
01:10:19,345 --> 01:10:19,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Little cramp.

900
01:10:20,508 --> 01:10:21,449
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to work that out.

901
01:10:21,489 --> 01:10:23,790
[SPEAKER_04]: He'd like to get back on the floor for the fourth quarter, I'm sure.

902
01:10:25,151 --> 01:10:26,612
[SPEAKER_04]: One more for Kane and Morris.

903
01:10:29,273 --> 01:10:30,054
[SPEAKER_04]: That one's pure.

904
01:10:30,074 --> 01:10:32,575
[SPEAKER_04]: And the lead is five.

905
01:10:33,856 --> 01:10:36,657
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit of pressure again here now from West Haven.

906
01:10:43,701 --> 01:10:44,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Here comes the pressure.

907
01:10:45,963 --> 01:10:46,403
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson.

908
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:50,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Attacks, finds Gaskin, Gaskin blocked, gets his own rebound.

909
01:10:51,523 --> 01:10:53,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Kicks back out, Phillips for three, short.

910
01:10:54,444 --> 01:10:55,485
[SPEAKER_04]: Westhaven's gonna run.

911
01:10:57,025 --> 01:11:02,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Johnson, wild spin and an offensive foul as Phillips took the charge.

912
01:11:03,249 --> 01:11:07,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Johnson was a half beat late on what would have been an exciting spin move.

913
01:11:07,311 --> 01:11:10,493
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Phillips holding his ground, missed a three, came back, played D.

914
01:11:12,361 --> 01:11:17,046
[SPEAKER_03]: stood his ground, drew the charge, the little things that make big things happen in A.C.

915
01:11:17,066 --> 01:11:19,629
[SPEAKER_03]: A little out of control that time by Johnson.

916
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:22,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Phillips gets rewarded with a foul called.

917
01:11:22,792 --> 01:11:31,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Full time out for New London, so we'll take a quick... We'll remind you that game day is brought to you by Waterford Dental Health.

[SPEAKER_04]: And Mr. G's.

928
01:12:02,537 --> 01:12:19,547

929
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:22,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Whalers with a five-point lead in the basketball.

930
01:12:22,089 --> 01:12:25,251
[SPEAKER_03]: Well balanced scoring tonight for New London Casey with you know

931
01:12:26,311 --> 01:12:28,313
[SPEAKER_03]: six players scoring all their points.

932
01:12:28,433 --> 01:12:38,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, Baudette with eight, JJ with six, you've got Jermier Hall with six, you know, and Deshaun Phillips with seven.

933
01:12:38,942 --> 01:12:41,865
[SPEAKER_03]: So, London sharing the basketball out there.

934
01:12:42,913 --> 01:12:44,874
[SPEAKER_04]: Pressure again from Westhaven.

935
01:12:45,235 --> 01:12:48,617
[SPEAKER_04]: Last time the Wailers tried to attack it once it got into Robinson's hand.

936
01:12:48,957 --> 01:12:49,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Patience until then.

937
01:12:50,258 --> 01:13:00,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaskin finds Robinson, finds Baudette, and that is how you break a press and cause the press to crumble because you get a basket out of it.

938
01:13:00,404 --> 01:13:04,387
[SPEAKER_03]: You attack it with Robinson and in the back end you get Baudette with ready hands this time.

939
01:13:04,667 --> 01:13:06,528
[SPEAKER_04]: Wailers now, they're in pressure.

940
01:13:07,028 --> 01:13:09,070
[SPEAKER_04]: And they've got Little trapped.

941
01:13:09,877 --> 01:13:11,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Five second, double dribble.

942
01:13:11,677 --> 01:13:12,958
[SPEAKER_04]: Double dribble from Little.

943
01:13:13,918 --> 01:13:15,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Whalers will have the ball.

944
01:13:16,198 --> 01:13:17,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Seven point lead.

945
01:13:17,758 --> 01:13:22,679
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, right now with 54 seconds left, this is a crucial point in the game for West Haven.

946
01:13:22,919 --> 01:13:23,880
[SPEAKER_04]: They're down seven.

947
01:13:24,140 --> 01:13:25,300
[SPEAKER_04]: They just have a turnover.

948
01:13:25,820 --> 01:13:28,580
[SPEAKER_04]: We only got about two or three possessions left in this quarter.

949
01:13:29,841 --> 01:13:31,001
[SPEAKER_03]: This game was tied.

950
01:13:32,041 --> 01:13:33,881
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll want to find a way to get cooking a little bit.

951
01:13:33,901 --> 01:13:36,882
[SPEAKER_03]: They've extended their lead, believe it or not, here in the third.

952
01:13:39,883 --> 01:13:40,583
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the problem here?

953
01:13:40,603 --> 01:13:42,044
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a time of official's whistle.

954
01:13:44,226 --> 01:13:45,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Official's time out there.

955
01:13:45,127 --> 01:13:49,209
[SPEAKER_04]: The way that Whalers have attacked this pressure the last two times is they've gotten it to Robinson.

956
01:13:49,850 --> 01:13:53,292
[SPEAKER_04]: And however they did it, either bounce pass to the middle or wing back to the middle.

957
01:13:53,312 --> 01:13:55,593
[SPEAKER_04]: And once it's in Robinson's hand, he attacks the basket.

958
01:13:55,613 --> 01:13:58,575
[SPEAKER_03]: He attacks, he goes, he draws a lot of attention.

959
01:13:58,896 --> 01:14:01,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you've got somebody like Bourdette on the backside.

960
01:14:01,377 --> 01:14:04,079
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's an easy pitch and catch for two for Jackson Bourdette.

961
01:14:04,700 --> 01:14:06,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, the key here is- Hold on, hold on.

962
01:14:06,881 --> 01:14:07,642
[SPEAKER_04]: That guy right there?

963
01:14:08,522 --> 01:14:15,867
[SPEAKER_04]: All-time letter winner, most letters of anybody at New London High School, multiple state championship, Trinity High School, he was all everything at Trinity, and you know what?

964
01:14:16,067 --> 01:14:16,888
[SPEAKER_04]: He knows how to use a mop.

965
01:14:16,928 --> 01:14:18,689
[SPEAKER_03]: He's setting up his own defense and a mop at the same time.

966
01:14:18,709 --> 01:14:22,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care if he's an all-time, I don't care if he's an all-time grade, he knows how to use a mop.

967
01:14:23,032 --> 01:14:23,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Gets down to work.

968
01:14:23,993 --> 01:14:24,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

969
01:14:25,013 --> 01:14:26,514
[SPEAKER_04]: You know who would never be seen using a mop?

970
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:27,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike DeMauro?

971
01:14:27,775 --> 01:14:28,415
[SPEAKER_04]: No, me.

972
01:14:28,716 --> 01:14:30,057
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

973
01:14:30,377 --> 01:14:30,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Me.

974
01:14:30,597 --> 01:14:33,279
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, no Swiffers, no mops, nothing.

975
01:14:33,319 --> 01:14:35,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you come in for mop-up duty, would you not?

976
01:14:35,540 --> 01:14:36,641
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were called in for mop-up duty.

977
01:14:36,661 --> 01:14:37,982
[SPEAKER_04]: I could go into mop-up duty, that's right.

978
01:14:40,351 --> 01:14:42,332
[SPEAKER_03]: Teams down 15 to 4 in the ninth inning.

979
01:14:42,852 --> 01:14:44,293
[SPEAKER_03]: That's bringing in Mayday Casey.

980
01:14:44,573 --> 01:14:45,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Mayday Malone, Mayday Casey.

981
01:14:45,974 --> 01:14:48,395
[SPEAKER_04]: I tell you though, the favorite quote of all time.

982
01:14:48,435 --> 01:14:50,116
[SPEAKER_04]: We lost in Newington one year.

983
01:14:50,156 --> 01:14:52,757
[SPEAKER_04]: I pitched five innings in an exhibition game.

984
01:14:53,157 --> 01:14:55,959
[SPEAKER_04]: We beat them in the state tournament like 2 to 1.

985
01:14:56,479 --> 01:14:59,201
[SPEAKER_04]: And they said, what's the biggest difference in this team and the team you faced earlier in the season?

986
01:14:59,241 --> 01:15:01,922
[SPEAKER_04]: And their head coach without batting an eyelash goes, O'Neal didn't pitch.

987
01:15:03,703 --> 01:15:12,777
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Robinson's been the key to this new London seven-point lead with his ability to attack the pressure, attack the rim, and find open bodies and deliver.

988
01:15:13,137 --> 01:15:18,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like they want to use as much clock as they can, limit West Haven to no more than one possession.

989
01:15:19,918 --> 01:15:22,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Paul Robinson, Gaskin, Phillips, and Bidette.

990
01:15:22,940 --> 01:15:23,781
[SPEAKER_04]: 13 on the shot clock.

991
01:15:24,381 --> 01:15:35,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson pulls up, zips it underneath to Phillips, but it was a little bit too much of a fastball, and so with 25 on the clock, West Haven can have the last shot of the quarter if they want.

992
01:15:36,930 --> 01:15:42,094
[SPEAKER_04]: Down seven, you would think they would want to limit one shot, no second possession for New London.

993
01:15:42,414 --> 01:15:45,516
[SPEAKER_03]: One and done, no run out with seven seconds to go.

994
01:15:46,337 --> 01:15:47,998
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care of the basketball, get a good look,

995
01:15:49,177 --> 01:15:53,479
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a good pass by Robinson, it was just a little bit too much of a fastball for Phillips to handle.

996
01:15:53,559 --> 01:15:54,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Pressure by New London.

997
01:15:56,780 --> 01:15:59,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Open look, Johnson, corner three, short.

998
01:15:59,541 --> 01:16:02,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaskin, 13 seconds, New London has a chance.

999
01:16:02,362 --> 01:16:04,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Gaskin spins, loses it on the floor.

1000
01:16:05,223 --> 01:16:08,524
[SPEAKER_04]: And with eight seconds remaining now, West Haven right back again will have a chance.

1001
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:13,873
[SPEAKER_04]: all the way to the basket and finishing is Tillman, a big basket.

1002
01:16:14,193 --> 01:16:19,216
[SPEAKER_04]: We're at the end of three and a big basket by Westhaven gets him to within five.

1003
01:16:19,536 --> 01:16:20,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Fourth quarter action coming.

1004
01:16:21,217 --> 01:16:23,578
[SPEAKER_04]: You're watching game day live on the day dot com.

1005
01:16:24,499 --> 01:16:29,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Last year, Waterford senior number four on the grade eight, the Olympic go kick.

1006
01:16:29,362 --> 01:16:30,642
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here with Cam Dickinson.

1007
01:16:30,863 --> 01:16:32,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think she can pull it off.

1008
01:16:32,644 --> 01:16:34,044
[SPEAKER_04]: It looks way too hard.

1009
01:16:34,365 --> 01:16:35,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was a fluke.

1010
01:16:35,745 --> 01:16:36,266
[SPEAKER_04]: Get it done.

1011
01:16:47,533 --> 01:16:50,555
[SPEAKER_04]: That was just too easy, and that is a grade eight play.

1012
01:16:50,995 --> 01:16:57,780
[SPEAKER_04]: Send in your best plays and see if you can beat that and make this year's grade eight Olympico style.

1013
01:16:59,642 --> 01:17:13,051
[SPEAKER_00]: Relive a century of history from the perspective of southeastern Connecticut with the new hardcover book, Front Page News, A Century of Big Stories in the Day, 1881 to 1981.

1014
01:17:13,172 --> 01:17:22,778
[SPEAKER_00]: This 136-page limited edition book captures the pulse of a region and a nation, showcasing the day's most iconic front pages from its first 100 years.

1015
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:27,942
[SPEAKER_00]: Order today at theday.frontpagesbook.com.

1016
01:17:31,732 --> 01:17:37,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Ty Sullivan and his West Haven Blue Devils down five as we start the fourth quarter.

1017
01:17:37,334 --> 01:17:39,774
[SPEAKER_04]: New London will have the first possession of the fourth quarter.

1018
01:17:40,275 --> 01:17:51,078
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got Robinson, Phillips, Baudette, Hall, and McKelvin on the floor as West Haven with a big basket by Tillman right before the end of the third period got them to within five.

1019
01:17:57,800 --> 01:18:01,221
[SPEAKER_04]: McKelvin swings, Phillips short, tipped.

1020
01:18:02,316 --> 01:18:03,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Westhaven's gonna run.

1021
01:18:03,997 --> 01:18:06,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Little, all the way to the basket.

1022
01:18:06,439 --> 01:18:09,621
[SPEAKER_04]: Foul is on the floor on Robinson on the reach.

1023
01:18:19,488 --> 01:18:21,090
[SPEAKER_04]: First personal foul on Robinson.

1024
01:18:22,651 --> 01:18:24,692
[SPEAKER_04]: They're gonna say it was in the act of shooting though, so.

1025
01:18:25,373 --> 01:18:25,993
[SPEAKER_03]: Jakai Little.

1026
01:18:26,013 --> 01:18:26,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Continuation?

1027
01:18:27,774 --> 01:18:28,415
[SPEAKER_04]: He was on the floor?

1028
01:18:32,128 --> 01:18:39,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Not exactly, you know, Giannis Antetokounmpo going to the basket, but first one in and out.

1029
01:18:41,653 --> 01:18:46,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Giannis Antetokounmpo, who gets continuation from half court.

1030
01:18:46,275 --> 01:18:47,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Talking NBA tonight, I'm all set with that.

1031
01:18:48,136 --> 01:18:52,318
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, not talking NBA, just referencing the Greek freak, that's all.

1032
01:18:53,598 --> 01:18:54,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Little misses them both.

1033
01:18:54,539 --> 01:18:55,659
[SPEAKER_04]: The ball don't lie sometimes.

1034
01:18:55,739 --> 01:18:56,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Game recognizes game.

1035
01:19:00,424 --> 01:19:05,887
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you watch Phillips too on his release of his jump shot the last few times in London, a lot of legs involved.

1036
01:19:05,907 --> 01:19:07,107
[SPEAKER_03]: His shots have been very flat.

1037
01:19:07,548 --> 01:19:12,830
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson blocked as he kind of found himself in the danger zone amongst the bigs.

1038
01:19:13,631 --> 01:19:15,391
[SPEAKER_04]: And Ogletree, literally a tree.

1039
01:19:15,531 --> 01:19:18,693
[SPEAKER_04]: So he found himself under the, amongst the Ogletrees.

1040
01:19:18,733 --> 01:19:19,153
[SPEAKER_04]: Tall kid.

1041
01:19:19,934 --> 01:19:20,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Number three.

1042
01:19:21,454 --> 01:19:22,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson.

1043
01:19:22,735 --> 01:19:23,695
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to kick ball.

1044
01:19:27,858 --> 01:19:28,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Do it a third time here.

1045
01:19:31,379 --> 01:19:34,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Trying to get that ball and a bounce pass to Phillips, which they have right there.

1046
01:19:42,882 --> 01:19:43,843
[SPEAKER_04]: Swinging it around now.

1047
01:19:45,943 --> 01:19:47,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Stagnant here on this trip.

1048
01:19:48,144 --> 01:19:49,845
[SPEAKER_04]: They're kind of back to that perimeter swing.

1049
01:19:50,925 --> 01:19:52,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing there, nothing there.

1050
01:19:52,605 --> 01:19:54,046
[SPEAKER_04]: Back around the perimeter, shot clock to 15.

1051
01:19:56,553 --> 01:19:58,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they're gonna run a play with 12 seconds left.

1052
01:19:58,515 --> 01:20:00,236
[SPEAKER_04]: This is usually where they find themselves in trouble.

1053
01:20:00,696 --> 01:20:07,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Eight seconds, Robinson, crossover, pull up, tipped and stolen by Johnson.

1054
01:20:08,262 --> 01:20:10,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Over the top of Phillips, no good.

1055
01:20:11,284 --> 01:20:12,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Put back, no good.

1056
01:20:13,046 --> 01:20:15,888
[SPEAKER_04]: And Little, working the offensive glass, will go to the line.

1057
01:20:16,817 --> 01:20:23,940
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, you know, when you're in the fourth quarter, the wasted offensive trips, you know, like that one for New London, you know, you didn't get a shot off there.

1058
01:20:23,980 --> 01:20:31,023
[SPEAKER_03]: And Robinson turned the corner, decided to kick it out, balls turned over, and an easy opportunity comes down for West Haven.

1059
01:20:31,043 --> 01:20:35,085
[SPEAKER_03]: But you've got to find a way to get at least a quality shot in the half court set.

1060
01:20:36,285 --> 01:20:37,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Foul was on Padet.

1061
01:20:38,746 --> 01:20:39,647
[SPEAKER_04]: Little will shoot two.

1062
01:20:41,227 --> 01:20:42,268
[SPEAKER_04]: First one is good.

1063
01:20:46,025 --> 01:20:51,466
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a juncture of the game, Casey, where you work so hard in that third quarter to build that seven point lead.

1064
01:20:51,866 --> 01:20:53,686
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to let West Haven back in the game.

1065
01:20:53,986 --> 01:20:55,227
[SPEAKER_03]: At least hold serve, hold court.

1066
01:20:57,287 --> 01:20:59,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Two free throws by Morris are good.

1067
01:21:03,308 --> 01:21:06,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Substitutions coming in the game for West Haven.

1068
01:21:06,169 --> 01:21:12,530
[SPEAKER_04]: 3-0 run to start the third quarter.

1069
01:21:12,550 --> 01:21:13,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Ball from the free throw line.

1070
01:21:14,904 --> 01:21:17,386
[SPEAKER_04]: So the fouls on Baudette, I don't know if that's two or three on Baudette.

1071
01:21:20,828 --> 01:21:21,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson.

1072
01:21:25,332 --> 01:21:29,195
[SPEAKER_04]: McKelvin now, squares up, looks for a cutter, back to Phillips.

1073
01:21:30,017 --> 01:21:34,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson, harassed, drives baseline, floats, hangs, no.

1074
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:38,699
[SPEAKER_04]: McKelvin gets the offensive rebound and it's knocked out of bounds.

1075
01:21:39,079 --> 01:21:40,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson went hard.

1076
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:45,241
[SPEAKER_04]: Only one foul on Baudette, so I thought they had, I thought I was worried about it being three or four and it was only one.

1077
01:21:46,081 --> 01:21:48,002
[SPEAKER_04]: So, lots of worry about nothing.

1078
01:21:50,442 --> 01:21:53,003
[SPEAKER_04]: Some more mopping on the floor as it's getting a little wet down there.

1079
01:21:55,556 --> 01:21:59,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Whalers caught a break there McKelvin had it knocked out of his hands timeout.

1080
01:21:59,817 --> 01:22:16,322
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good timeout by coach Dave right there the offense is kind of sputtered the last two or three downs down the court talk things over set up an inbound piece you know and go from there right now Robinson seems to be the only the only aggressive piece on the offensive end you know start the fourth quarter for New London.

1081
01:22:16,442 --> 01:22:17,983
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem with this with what if

1082
01:22:18,683 --> 01:22:26,348
[SPEAKER_04]: If they get to about 10 seconds on the shot clock, they don't have anything to that they can do other than sort of the reckless drive to the basket.

1083
01:22:26,828 --> 01:22:39,795
[SPEAKER_04]: So they really, if they don't get a shot off and a good look by about the 15 second mark, then their offense becomes one dimensional and not something that West Haven really worries about because they've got the size and length.

1084
01:22:40,396 --> 01:22:43,357
[SPEAKER_04]: So you watch the Whalers start to move and you can tell at about 25 seconds,

1085
01:22:44,738 --> 01:22:55,445
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this going to be a swing around the perimeter possession or a hero basketball move and that's what so you know they've got to get the ball at the 25 second mark into the paint or to the cutter.

1086
01:22:55,725 --> 01:23:02,890
[SPEAKER_04]: If they're just going to go around the perimeter at 25 seconds then they look up and there's 15 and they got they got to start going and then they're at a you know they got nothing.

1087
01:23:03,090 --> 01:23:08,133
[SPEAKER_03]: The offense breaks down the quality becomes less than what coach Dave Cornish would want to see.

1088
01:23:08,213 --> 01:23:08,694
[SPEAKER_03]: That is correct.

1089
01:23:09,454 --> 01:23:10,635
[SPEAKER_04]: So Robinson will inbound.

1090
01:23:13,245 --> 01:23:16,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Kanan Morris who's done a great job for the Blue Devils on him.

1091
01:23:16,648 --> 01:23:18,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Bedette flashes, catches it high.

1092
01:23:18,651 --> 01:23:22,454
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's harassed and we're gonna get a foul on Ogletree.

1093
01:23:22,514 --> 01:23:23,916
[SPEAKER_03]: Ogletree doesn't like it, that's a good call.

1094
01:23:25,137 --> 01:23:27,560
[SPEAKER_03]: Grabbing the back of his wrist, holding the ball high.

1095
01:23:29,582 --> 01:23:32,725
[SPEAKER_03]: The double team is definitely coming when he touches the basketball.

1096
01:23:38,243 --> 01:23:40,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Inbound McKelvin, stolen.

1097
01:23:40,404 --> 01:23:41,885
[SPEAKER_04]: That was good hands from Johnson.

1098
01:23:42,445 --> 01:23:46,467
[SPEAKER_04]: They almost turned it over, but Tillman, so quick to the basketball.

1099
01:23:52,109 --> 01:23:53,250
[SPEAKER_04]: Tillman with Hall on him.

1100
01:23:53,270 --> 01:23:58,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hanging in the air with a left hand.

1101
01:23:58,772 --> 01:24:01,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Jakai Little, and the lead is one.

1102
01:24:01,573 --> 01:24:02,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Timeout.

1103
01:24:03,354 --> 01:24:05,455
[SPEAKER_04]: Ty Sullivan, because they want to set up pressure.

1104
01:24:05,695 --> 01:24:06,196
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a 6-0 run.

1105
01:24:07,850 --> 01:24:10,210
[SPEAKER_03]: to start the fourth quarter for West Haven.

1106
01:24:11,611 --> 01:24:15,971
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, right now, New London is just floundering on the offensive end.

1107
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:24,273
[SPEAKER_03]: And much like the start of the third quarter, KC West Haven kind of comes out, they impose their will on the defensive end, and they get some easy buckets on the other side.

1108
01:24:24,693 --> 01:24:27,393
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got four points from the free throw line, and then one made layup.

1109
01:24:27,433 --> 01:24:28,914
[SPEAKER_03]: That's their point so far in the fourth quarter.

1110
01:24:29,154 --> 01:24:37,595
[SPEAKER_04]: And New London hasn't gotten a reasonable shot in this quarter, because they've been sort of relegated to the perimeter, where New London took off

1111
01:24:38,130 --> 01:24:45,520
[SPEAKER_04]: was when they were breaking pressure and getting layups, or when they had Robinson attack the middle and find his teammates.

1112
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:52,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, New London is out of sync, out of sorts, and out of time here with a one-point lead for them to figure out how to run their offense.

1113
01:24:54,121 --> 01:24:57,122
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, who's gonna step up and be that next player?

1114
01:24:57,182 --> 01:24:59,764
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, Hall hasn't had any good looks.

1115
01:25:00,484 --> 01:25:07,187
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I guess I'm still waiting for Phillips to kind of step up and put his stamp on this game as a senior in the last six minutes.

1116
01:25:07,567 --> 01:25:09,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously Robinson, very aggressive.

1117
01:25:09,828 --> 01:25:10,829
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Bourdette's out there.

1118
01:25:11,229 --> 01:25:14,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's just make things easy for ourselves on the offensive end.

1119
01:25:14,811 --> 01:25:17,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay aggressive, move the basketball.

1120
01:25:21,208 --> 01:25:26,893
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen this, though, a few different times in the London team, where they kind of build a little bit of a lead for themselves and fall asleep.

1121
01:25:27,313 --> 01:25:30,996
[SPEAKER_03]: Then have to climb back up and take another four or five point lead and kind of hang on a little bit.

1122
01:25:32,397 --> 01:25:33,338
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good West Haven team.

1123
01:25:33,799 --> 01:25:34,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Very good West Haven team.

1124
01:25:35,160 --> 01:25:42,126
[SPEAKER_04]: They will drop out of pressure off the timeout, which I wouldn't be pressuring New London either, because that's the easy way to give them on offense.

1125
01:25:43,327 --> 01:25:45,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Warren back into the game for Hall.

1126
01:25:45,308 --> 01:25:48,351
[SPEAKER_04]: Original starting five in the game now for the Whalers.

1127
01:25:48,851 --> 01:25:49,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Warren.

1128
01:25:50,010 --> 01:25:50,950
[SPEAKER_04]: dumps down to Baudette.

1129
01:25:51,230 --> 01:25:55,972
[SPEAKER_04]: He's doubled and he's tied up and the possession arrow favors West Haven.

1130
01:25:56,452 --> 01:25:57,533
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the one problem.

1131
01:25:57,593 --> 01:25:58,353
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what they want.

1132
01:25:58,393 --> 01:26:01,214
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to get the dump down so that they can double Baudette.

1133
01:26:01,654 --> 01:26:04,235
[SPEAKER_03]: Baudette is telling them I don't I don't need the basketball right there.

1134
01:26:04,275 --> 01:26:08,077
[SPEAKER_03]: Put it up high where I can grab it and turn and face the bounce pass is no good.

1135
01:26:09,857 --> 01:26:13,439
[SPEAKER_04]: Again they were letting Warren they had said please shoot the three.

1136
01:26:16,820 --> 01:26:19,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Spot up wide open three no good.

1137
01:26:20,493 --> 01:26:22,895
[SPEAKER_04]: That was Morris, now Robinson with the basketball.

1138
01:26:22,935 --> 01:26:26,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson hangs, finds Padet, soft touch, lead is 3.

1139
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:30,523
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, good recognition that time by Robinson, noticing the big man out in front.

1140
01:26:31,304 --> 01:26:34,247
[SPEAKER_03]: And Padet with 12 to lead the way for the Whalers.

1141
01:26:34,887 --> 01:26:35,968
[SPEAKER_04]: That's when they're at their best.

1142
01:26:36,008 --> 01:26:37,129
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a big bucket too.

1143
01:26:37,229 --> 01:26:41,574
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, when Robinson distributes and Padet finishes, that's when they're at their best.

1144
01:26:42,583 --> 01:26:45,124
[SPEAKER_04]: Around the curl, Johnson, he's been very hot.

1145
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:50,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that time, however, as that goes out of bounds, and it'll be Whaler basketball.

1146
01:26:50,786 --> 01:26:52,286
[SPEAKER_03]: Boy, you're so right about Robinson.

1147
01:26:52,306 --> 01:26:59,108
[SPEAKER_03]: When he gets himself freewheeling, nobody around him, he can survey the floor a little bit, you know, and you've gotta be ready.

1148
01:26:59,509 --> 01:27:06,051
[SPEAKER_03]: You've gotta make yourself available, whether you're, you know, McKelvin Jr., or Jackson Bourdette, or even Savon Warren.

1149
01:27:06,071 --> 01:27:09,852
[SPEAKER_03]: Just be ready for the basketball, because, you know, if you're open, he's gonna get it to you.

1150
01:27:14,513 --> 01:27:15,856
[SPEAKER_04]: Warren, that ball is tipped.

1151
01:27:16,557 --> 01:27:17,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Stolen by Morris.

1152
01:27:18,661 --> 01:27:20,845
[SPEAKER_04]: And a laziness, the lazy passes.

1153
01:27:23,457 --> 01:27:24,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Steal the other direction.

1154
01:27:24,898 --> 01:27:27,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Phillips goes to the left hand.

1155
01:27:27,619 --> 01:27:28,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Tipped out of bounds.

1156
01:27:29,060 --> 01:27:30,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Wildly flung in.

1157
01:27:30,220 --> 01:27:31,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson gets it.

1158
01:27:31,701 --> 01:27:33,222
[SPEAKER_04]: He finds Warren, but it's on the floor.

1159
01:27:33,242 --> 01:27:35,343
[SPEAKER_04]: And Warren wisely pulls it out.

1160
01:27:35,443 --> 01:27:36,704
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, floats.

1161
01:27:37,204 --> 01:27:37,784
[SPEAKER_04]: No good.

1162
01:27:37,924 --> 01:27:38,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Tipped.

1163
01:27:38,625 --> 01:27:39,245
[SPEAKER_04]: No good.

1164
01:27:39,645 --> 01:27:40,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's going to come down with it?

1165
01:27:41,446 --> 01:27:43,227
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be Johnson.

1166
01:27:43,387 --> 01:27:45,568
[SPEAKER_04]: Big defensive rebound for West Haven.

1167
01:27:47,889 --> 01:27:49,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, if New London could finish around the back.

1168
01:27:49,590 --> 01:27:50,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Just make a layup.

1169
01:27:50,251 --> 01:27:52,652
[SPEAKER_03]: My goodness.

1170
01:28:02,067 --> 01:28:12,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Bellamy Tillman rather Tillman step back three no good offensive rebound Ogletree and they're going to have a foul.

1171
01:28:12,831 --> 01:28:15,452
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like Warren peeking in from the outside region.

1172
01:28:16,192 --> 01:28:17,273
[SPEAKER_04]: It is going to be on Warren.

1173
01:28:18,158 --> 01:28:24,765
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's going to put Ogletree at the line to shoot two and Ogletree's length has definitely bothered New London.

1174
01:28:24,805 --> 01:28:29,089
[SPEAKER_04]: He has been in for Roman for a while now and Ogletree has been their main guy on the glass.

1175
01:28:29,209 --> 01:28:31,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to find a body on the bigs.

1176
01:28:31,652 --> 01:28:36,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Got to keep him off the glass on the offensive end.

1177
01:28:36,717 --> 01:28:41,421
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the knocks on New London, the whispers around the league was

1178
01:28:42,314 --> 01:28:43,774
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't win the close game.

1179
01:28:43,794 --> 01:28:46,575
[SPEAKER_04]: If you get them in a close one, they don't know how to finish.

1180
01:28:46,635 --> 01:28:48,076
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been Dave's M.O.

1181
01:28:48,136 --> 01:28:50,117
[SPEAKER_03]: for a long time, even using the ledger.

1182
01:28:50,137 --> 01:28:54,058
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, how do you, how do you close out somebody's close game, situational basketball?

1183
01:28:54,478 --> 01:28:56,699
[SPEAKER_04]: They said if they get a lead, they can run away with it.

1184
01:28:56,739 --> 01:28:57,819
[SPEAKER_04]: They can, they can bury it.

1185
01:28:57,839 --> 01:28:58,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

1186
01:28:58,179 --> 01:29:03,741
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you keep yourself in a close one, if you keep yourself in a close one, you know, that Crosby game was close late, but they pulled away.

1187
01:29:03,781 --> 01:29:03,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1188
01:29:04,281 --> 01:29:09,365
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, can they win a game when it's a one possession game, you know, under a minute?

1189
01:29:09,545 --> 01:29:13,147
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to find out because I don't think West Haven's going anywhere here in these last four minutes.

1190
01:29:16,470 --> 01:29:19,032
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're packing it in West Haven too.

1191
01:29:19,912 --> 01:29:21,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, challenging the one in the shoot to three.

1192
01:29:24,395 --> 01:29:29,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Hall now Robinson looking for a high screen from Bidette gets the mismatch, but we're down to 10 seconds.

1193
01:29:30,219 --> 01:29:30,700
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson.

1194
01:29:32,102 --> 01:29:38,567
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the same thing before, Robinson gets a screen, drives, floats, left hand, it's blocked by Johnson.

1195
01:29:40,048 --> 01:29:42,350
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to get a foul, I think on McKelvin on the push.

1196
01:29:45,132 --> 01:29:46,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, foul's on McKelvin.

1197
01:29:46,653 --> 01:29:50,296
[SPEAKER_03]: And that wild circus shot came with two seconds on the shot clock.

1198
01:29:52,238 --> 01:29:57,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, they cannot run an offense with ten seconds left on the shot clock.

1199
01:30:03,104 --> 01:30:09,028
[SPEAKER_03]: London with only two points this quarter they led 39-32 coming into the fourth.

1200
01:30:10,669 --> 01:30:21,656
[SPEAKER_04]: West Haven with a chance to tie or take the lead and that would be interesting if they ever took the lead what does new how does New London respond you know they haven't lost the lead yet.

1201
01:30:24,798 --> 01:30:27,480
[SPEAKER_04]: No good tipped keeping it alive.

1202
01:30:28,812 --> 01:30:36,516
[SPEAKER_04]: was little, little, kick out, wide open, three is up, no good, weak side, Phillips, he's ahead, he's got numbers.

1203
01:30:37,436 --> 01:30:41,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Blocked by Morris, now Westhaven the other direction.

1204
01:30:43,859 --> 01:30:45,660
[SPEAKER_04]: A charge, nice job by Hall.

1205
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:54,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Offensive foul as Jameer Hall stood his ground and took the charge from Morris and that is the second time Hall has done that.

1206
01:30:58,033 --> 01:31:01,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Taking one for the team is a new definition on that one, my friend.

1207
01:31:02,336 --> 01:31:04,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Holding your ground, absorbing the blow.

1208
01:31:04,138 --> 01:31:11,283
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, Phillips that time with numbers, Casey, and kind of indecisive with the basketball.

1209
01:31:11,643 --> 01:31:12,604
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is he going to do with it?

1210
01:31:12,664 --> 01:31:16,127
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if you're three steps from the rim, drive over to the rim and finish.

1211
01:31:17,147 --> 01:31:18,288
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're making a priority.

1212
01:31:18,368 --> 01:31:20,730
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're guarding Phillips from the jump.

1213
01:31:20,750 --> 01:31:21,991
[SPEAKER_04]: They're making a priority of him.

1214
01:31:23,831 --> 01:31:31,557
[SPEAKER_04]: New London's got to find a way to get an offense going here and not just pass the ball around the perimeter they're just they're playing shot clock basketball right now.

1215
01:31:32,157 --> 01:31:36,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta stay aggressive high ball screen here from Burdett the double team comes.

1216
01:31:36,420 --> 01:31:41,044
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're gonna get a foul.

1217
01:31:41,895 --> 01:31:42,635
[SPEAKER_04]: foul on Ogletree.

1218
01:31:42,735 --> 01:31:47,297
[SPEAKER_04]: On Ogletree, which I think is a break for Robinson because they had him in a dangerous spot as well.

1219
01:31:47,417 --> 01:31:48,597
[SPEAKER_03]: He's right on half court.

1220
01:31:48,617 --> 01:31:55,940
[SPEAKER_03]: The double team comes a little too greedy that time with the hands by Tyrone Ogletree.

1221
01:32:00,762 --> 01:32:02,402
[SPEAKER_03]: It's five on Ogletree, he's fouled out.

1222
01:32:02,622 --> 01:32:04,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Ogletree fouls out of the game.

1223
01:32:05,003 --> 01:32:08,464
[SPEAKER_04]: Roman coming back into the game is no picnic with Ogletree going away.

1224
01:32:08,524 --> 01:32:09,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Roman's been incredibly active.

1225
01:32:09,345 --> 01:32:10,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Length comes back with Length.

1226
01:32:11,929 --> 01:32:17,715
[SPEAKER_04]: But the Whalers need to find a way to get I mean I don't like this sitting outside and letting 30 seconds go up the shot I mean that's just that's ridiculous.

1227
01:32:19,296 --> 01:32:20,177
[SPEAKER_03]: They got to run an offense.

1228
01:32:20,478 --> 01:32:25,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Robinson's kind of fiddling and diddling but doing nothing with the basketball at the top of the circle.

1229
01:32:26,203 --> 01:32:31,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they were saying it wasn't on Ogletree and they're trying to get Ogletree to fit the foul switched off of Ogletree.

1230
01:32:31,849 --> 01:32:35,673
[SPEAKER_04]: You see Kevin Kobelski the outstanding official talking to West Haven.

1231
01:32:38,017 --> 01:32:42,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at some fans, security's looking at some fans over there behind the bench.

1232
01:32:46,600 --> 01:32:48,900
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's going on there.

1233
01:32:49,020 --> 01:32:53,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Four fouls for New London and three for West Haven.

1234
01:32:56,063 --> 01:33:01,364
[SPEAKER_04]: So New London will inbound, Hall far away from us on the far court.

1235
01:33:03,345 --> 01:33:04,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson out.

1236
01:33:10,927 --> 01:33:13,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Hall, open three, third one of the game.

1237
01:33:14,528 --> 01:33:17,550
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Jameer Hall, shooter's gonna shoot.

1238
01:33:17,850 --> 01:33:19,330
[SPEAKER_04]: I see you, Jameer Hall.

1239
01:33:22,031 --> 01:33:25,513
[SPEAKER_03]: Big time shot from the junior.

1240
01:33:30,735 --> 01:33:33,476
[SPEAKER_04]: Step in, jump shot, no good.

1241
01:33:34,856 --> 01:33:36,897
[SPEAKER_04]: And Bidet knocks it out of bounds.

1242
01:33:37,697 --> 01:33:43,262
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the way Hall works on the baseline, frees himself up, nails it.

1243
01:33:43,782 --> 01:33:44,783
[SPEAKER_03]: Huge shot.

1244
01:33:44,803 --> 01:33:48,727
[SPEAKER_03]: A little breathing room for New London with under two to go.

1245
01:33:49,407 --> 01:33:51,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's like breathing room on a cold day with asthma.

1246
01:33:57,314 --> 01:33:59,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Up top, Tillman.

1247
01:33:59,096 --> 01:33:59,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Tillman.

1248
01:34:04,795 --> 01:34:08,814
[SPEAKER_04]: West Haven taking some time they're gonna be methodical they need a basket which means they need a good look.

1249
01:34:10,778 --> 01:34:13,959
[SPEAKER_04]: Open look, three, no good from Morris.

1250
01:34:14,999 --> 01:34:16,920
[SPEAKER_04]: Offensive rebound and a foul.

1251
01:34:17,700 --> 01:34:22,781
[SPEAKER_04]: Offensive rebound came down to Johnson and that'll put him at the line to shoot two and he's a good shooter.

1252
01:34:23,001 --> 01:34:28,883
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to find a way in these long three point shots if you're in London to find the glass.

1253
01:34:28,923 --> 01:34:31,103
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean long shots, long rebounds.

1254
01:34:31,163 --> 01:34:34,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Box out on the shooter, all five guys with their faces in the glass.

1255
01:34:36,084 --> 01:34:38,225
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to take care of the basketball on the defensive end.

1256
01:34:41,968 --> 01:34:43,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Two shots for Aaron Johnson.

1257
01:34:43,509 --> 01:34:46,309
[SPEAKER_04]: He's been an excellent shooter for them all night long.

1258
01:34:48,830 --> 01:34:53,232
[SPEAKER_04]: And he, oh, that one was, that one was in the net and it came out the other way.

1259
01:35:02,175 --> 01:35:03,035
[SPEAKER_04]: One more for Johnson.

1260
01:35:04,229 --> 01:35:07,210
[SPEAKER_04]: We said Little, see Little has the friendly rim rolls all night.

1261
01:35:07,610 --> 01:35:10,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Johnson, the ugly rim that time.

1262
01:35:10,851 --> 01:35:12,211
[SPEAKER_04]: Good basketball game here tonight, huh?

1263
01:35:12,811 --> 01:35:14,992
[SPEAKER_04]: One of two, four, now Westhaven's gonna pressure.

1264
01:35:15,472 --> 01:35:20,953
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this is where New London has a chance to use this pressure as an opportunity to score.

1265
01:35:21,373 --> 01:35:24,414
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson breaks the pressure, attacks the basket.

1266
01:35:25,154 --> 01:35:28,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Off him, great weak side help, and the block.

1267
01:35:29,640 --> 01:35:30,861
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll be West Haven ball.

1268
01:35:31,261 --> 01:35:34,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Get to the rim, maybe a ball fake or something like that if you're Robinson.

1269
01:35:34,823 --> 01:35:36,905
[SPEAKER_03]: You're kind of in no man's land a little bit.

1270
01:35:37,645 --> 01:35:43,069
[SPEAKER_03]: Bounce pass on the backside, maybe to Bourdette.

1271
01:35:43,109 --> 01:35:44,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy to say when I'm not out there.

1272
01:35:44,470 --> 01:35:46,411
[SPEAKER_03]: When you have a head of steam, you just want to go.

1273
01:35:46,871 --> 01:35:47,812
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what we said.

1274
01:35:47,972 --> 01:35:50,914
[SPEAKER_04]: Can New London find a way to close out this close game?

1275
01:35:51,534 --> 01:35:52,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Time out, West Haven.

1276
01:35:58,088 --> 01:35:59,989
[SPEAKER_03]: The brain trust over there for New London.

1277
01:36:00,009 --> 01:36:01,851
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got a great staff Casey.

1278
01:36:02,471 --> 01:36:11,138
[SPEAKER_03]: You know whether it's Troy McKelvin or Danny Spellman and it's just a lot of good basketball minds around him.

1279
01:36:11,418 --> 01:36:12,218
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave Cornish does.

1280
01:36:12,579 --> 01:36:14,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the order of things for the Whalers.

1281
01:36:15,481 --> 01:36:17,022
[SPEAKER_04]: Sound defensive effort.

1282
01:36:18,043 --> 01:36:18,643
[SPEAKER_04]: Rebound.

1283
01:36:18,863 --> 01:36:19,084
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1284
01:36:19,644 --> 01:36:19,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1285
01:36:20,505 --> 01:36:24,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Regardless of whether you make or miss you're going to have the lead.

1286
01:36:25,570 --> 01:36:30,691
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it's you have a four point lead with the ball then you know now you got to possess the ball.

1287
01:36:31,251 --> 01:36:31,471
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1288
01:36:31,491 --> 01:36:32,131
[SPEAKER_04]: Be smart with it.

1289
01:36:32,572 --> 01:36:36,852
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to pressure you if you have a two point lead or a one point lead.

1290
01:36:37,113 --> 01:36:37,853
[SPEAKER_04]: They're good.

1291
01:36:37,893 --> 01:36:38,893
[SPEAKER_04]: They may not pressure you.

1292
01:36:38,933 --> 01:36:40,313
[SPEAKER_04]: They may choose to play shot clock.

1293
01:36:40,713 --> 01:36:46,135
[SPEAKER_04]: But what New London absolutely has to do first is sound defense and rebound.

1294
01:36:46,155 --> 01:36:46,755
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care of the best.

1295
01:36:46,795 --> 01:36:47,895
[SPEAKER_04]: No more second chances.

1296
01:36:48,175 --> 01:36:50,635
[SPEAKER_04]: West Haven is in a fascinating spot.

1297
01:36:51,436 --> 01:36:52,676
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they go for a two.

1298
01:36:53,707 --> 01:36:55,628
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, I don't think they're gonna pressure.

1299
01:36:56,188 --> 01:36:59,269
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're gonna drop back, because they all have a full shot clock.

1300
01:36:59,529 --> 01:37:03,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I would make New London try to score.

1301
01:37:03,770 --> 01:37:05,990
[SPEAKER_04]: If you play that out, it's still a three possession game.

1302
01:37:06,131 --> 01:37:09,451
[SPEAKER_04]: What New London cannot do here is give up an open look three.

1303
01:37:10,332 --> 01:37:13,713
[SPEAKER_04]: If West Haven's gonna score, you gotta make them get it in the basket area.

1304
01:37:20,435 --> 01:37:21,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Tillman, the senior guard.

1305
01:37:24,835 --> 01:37:38,623
[SPEAKER_04]: swing they'll give that shot he wanted it instead wild shot no good and Warren tipped it.

1306
01:37:39,064 --> 01:37:41,585
[SPEAKER_04]: Cornish will call a timeout with 1-12.

1307
01:37:43,586 --> 01:37:52,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Part one yes defend the rim rebound take care of the basketball settle things down things a little unrest out there coach Cornish wants to call timeout.

1308
01:37:52,712 --> 01:37:53,052
[SPEAKER_03]: Now with a

1309
01:37:59,003 --> 01:38:06,510
[SPEAKER_04]: So Griswold, who has down 10 at the end of three, has cut it to one in the final seconds of their quarterfinal game.

1310
01:38:06,550 --> 01:38:08,832
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be their semifinal game coming up.

1311
01:38:08,852 --> 01:38:09,893
[SPEAKER_04]: They make the semifinals.

1312
01:38:09,993 --> 01:38:10,874
[SPEAKER_04]: It's their quarterfinal game.

1313
01:38:10,914 --> 01:38:12,615
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm out of sorts now.

1314
01:38:12,675 --> 01:38:12,976
[SPEAKER_04]: You know why?

1315
01:38:12,996 --> 01:38:14,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I was ready to explain a point to you.

1316
01:38:14,697 --> 01:38:15,117
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I got you.

1317
01:38:15,137 --> 01:38:15,658
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand.

1318
01:38:15,758 --> 01:38:16,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Or the audience.

1319
01:38:16,859 --> 01:38:17,540
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the points.

1320
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:18,701
[SPEAKER_03]: Explain to the audience.

1321
01:38:19,201 --> 01:38:21,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Four is a huge number.

1322
01:38:21,203 --> 01:38:21,984
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a two possession game.

1323
01:38:22,004 --> 01:38:22,384
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.

1324
01:38:22,902 --> 01:38:26,644
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think West Haven is going to try to pressure and trap.

1325
01:38:27,104 --> 01:38:35,749
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think they got a foul, because I don't think they can be down four with 30 seconds left or 40 seconds left in the game.

1326
01:38:35,989 --> 01:38:36,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Still one to give.

1327
01:38:37,190 --> 01:38:37,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

1328
01:38:37,430 --> 01:38:42,492
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think you're going to see pressure, and then the foul.

1329
01:38:42,933 --> 01:38:44,153
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't give up the layup.

1330
01:38:44,653 --> 01:38:47,495
[SPEAKER_04]: What'll be interesting is if New London gets the layup,

1331
01:38:48,441 --> 01:38:51,582
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they take it, or do they try to run the entire clock?

1332
01:38:51,602 --> 01:38:52,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I would attack it.

1333
01:38:52,463 --> 01:38:53,063
[SPEAKER_03]: I would attack it.

1334
01:38:53,083 --> 01:38:56,824
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's giving you there, and you've got numbers, and you beat the pressure, I would attack the rim.

1335
01:38:59,786 --> 01:39:06,688
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, New London, Casey, you know, I mean, and Coach Cornish and his teams, I mean, they don't do very well with the game in a cooler.

1336
01:39:06,968 --> 01:39:09,389
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, they're better once you beat that pressure.

1337
01:39:09,729 --> 01:39:13,311
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can go get the rim with Phillips, you can go get the rim with Robinson, go get it.

1338
01:39:15,647 --> 01:39:16,928
[SPEAKER_03]: It's always been Dave style of play.

1339
01:39:17,708 --> 01:39:20,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Four guards, well three guards McKelvin and Baudette.

1340
01:39:21,530 --> 01:39:25,472
[SPEAKER_04]: Hall passes it off to Robinson.

1341
01:39:26,112 --> 01:39:27,393
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson breaks pressure.

1342
01:39:29,114 --> 01:39:30,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Here comes the double team.

1343
01:39:30,915 --> 01:39:33,216
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson nifty with the basketball.

1344
01:39:33,736 --> 01:39:34,777
[SPEAKER_04]: They haven't fouled them yet.

1345
01:39:34,917 --> 01:39:36,638
[SPEAKER_04]: There comes another double and there's the foul.

1346
01:39:37,615 --> 01:39:42,698
[SPEAKER_04]: Good job because that foul resets the shot clock and it's only the fourth.

1347
01:39:42,718 --> 01:39:48,641
[SPEAKER_04]: So now New London, now they have to come out and foul New London with 35 seconds on the shot clock.

1348
01:39:49,402 --> 01:39:51,423
[SPEAKER_04]: So get it into a free throw shooter's hands here.

1349
01:39:53,864 --> 01:39:55,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Which I think they're gonna try to get it to Robinson or Phillips.

1350
01:39:56,045 --> 01:39:57,086
[SPEAKER_04]: And a double's coming.

1351
01:40:05,330 --> 01:40:06,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson will inbound.

1352
01:40:09,225 --> 01:40:14,067
[SPEAKER_04]: And a timeout, Whalers, as the immediate pass was not there on the inbound.

1353
01:40:18,350 --> 01:40:20,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Good ballgame here at New London High School, the way it should be.

1354
01:40:21,471 --> 01:40:22,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Four to final action.

1355
01:40:26,420 --> 01:40:33,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Ladies and gentlemen, the Griswold Wolverines have punched their ticket to the semifinals with a buzzer beater.

1356
01:40:34,149 --> 01:40:37,333
[SPEAKER_04]: A buzzer beating win for the Griswold Wolverines.

1357
01:40:37,393 --> 01:40:43,260
[SPEAKER_04]: The division two champions of the ECC are in the semifinals of division four.

1358
01:40:43,901 --> 01:40:45,183
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

1359
01:40:46,272 --> 01:40:50,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, we've got teams all over the place in the semifinals right now.

1360
01:40:50,895 --> 01:40:53,916
[SPEAKER_03]: This league has fared extremely well.

1361
01:40:54,036 --> 01:40:56,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to put it in perspective, if New London can hold on.

1362
01:40:57,251 --> 01:40:58,351
[SPEAKER_04]: There's St.

1363
01:40:58,391 --> 01:41:00,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Bernard's in the Division 1 semis.

1364
01:41:00,452 --> 01:41:05,234
[SPEAKER_04]: There would be New London and NFA playing each other in the Division 2 semis, guaranteeing a final spot.

1365
01:41:05,614 --> 01:41:12,917
[SPEAKER_04]: There would be Fitch in the Division 3 semis, Grizzled in the Division 4 semis, and Old Lime and Grasso Tech, who are ECC adjacent.

1366
01:41:13,017 --> 01:41:14,077
[SPEAKER_04]: They're local teams.

1367
01:41:14,337 --> 01:41:15,858
[SPEAKER_04]: They are game day teams.

1368
01:41:16,218 --> 01:41:18,919
[SPEAKER_04]: They're in a semifinal already, guaranteeing a final.

1369
01:41:19,772 --> 01:41:28,597
[SPEAKER_04]: And the girls we already said have three or four in class M. The ECC has acquitted itself well, but New London has to hold on here to guarantee that semifinal benefit.

1370
01:41:28,617 --> 01:41:30,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Finish the job if you're New London.

1371
01:41:30,178 --> 01:41:31,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Good time out by Robinson.

1372
01:41:31,719 --> 01:41:34,220
[SPEAKER_03]: A little out of sorts on the inbounds.

1373
01:41:34,520 --> 01:41:35,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk it over.

1374
01:41:35,140 --> 01:41:38,742
[SPEAKER_03]: A little different look this time on the inbounds for New London.

1375
01:41:38,762 --> 01:41:44,566
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to give Bidet available for a lob as well as the bigger screen.

1376
01:41:44,926 --> 01:41:47,127
[SPEAKER_04]: The little screen from Hall didn't free anybody up.

1377
01:41:47,367 --> 01:41:48,928
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's Bidet with a bigger screen.

1378
01:41:49,277 --> 01:41:50,618
[SPEAKER_04]: And they go long to Hall.

1379
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:53,219
[SPEAKER_04]: Here comes the pressure.

1380
01:41:53,299 --> 01:41:54,000
[SPEAKER_04]: Pick the dribble up.

1381
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:55,060
[SPEAKER_04]: And a steal.

1382
01:41:55,100 --> 01:41:55,941
[SPEAKER_04]: No man's land.

1383
01:41:57,742 --> 01:42:03,885
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're going to get a foul on the perimeter, which will give two shots to West Haven.

1384
01:42:04,585 --> 01:42:07,927
[SPEAKER_04]: And if they can make both and pressure, it brings it down to a one point game.

1385
01:42:08,027 --> 01:42:09,328
[SPEAKER_04]: And they no longer have to foul.

1386
01:42:09,608 --> 01:42:14,370
[SPEAKER_03]: God, I think I want the ball in Robinson's hand on the inbounds or Phillips.

1387
01:42:14,831 --> 01:42:16,392
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe have Hall be the trigger man.

1388
01:42:16,792 --> 01:42:17,872
[SPEAKER_03]: Get JJ the rock.

1389
01:42:17,892 --> 01:42:18,613
[SPEAKER_03]: Let him do his thing.

1390
01:42:19,533 --> 01:42:22,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Ja'Kai Little, sophomore from West Haven will shoot two.

1391
01:42:23,076 --> 01:42:27,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, New England's got a rebound too off this second one if West Haven puts anybody in.

1392
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:30,483
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're going to set up pressure and not try for the offensive rebound.

1393
01:42:32,385 --> 01:42:33,385
[SPEAKER_04]: First one no good.

1394
01:42:33,786 --> 01:42:38,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Guarantees that it remains the full one possession.

1395
01:42:39,291 --> 01:42:42,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Such a huge miss at this juncture of the game, 48 seconds left to go.

1396
01:42:44,596 --> 01:42:48,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Morris has had a, I'm sorry, Littles had a fantastic ball game.

1397
01:42:48,737 --> 01:42:49,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Misses them both.

1398
01:42:49,998 --> 01:42:51,938
[SPEAKER_04]: McKelvin with the rebound, he's tied up.

1399
01:42:53,378 --> 01:42:54,979
[SPEAKER_04]: Possession arrow favors New London.

1400
01:42:56,939 --> 01:43:01,581
[SPEAKER_04]: But a big tie up for Westhaven because it flips the script, flips the arrow.

1401
01:43:01,921 --> 01:43:05,602
[SPEAKER_04]: Who wants to win the game, that's what it's about right now.

1402
01:43:05,622 --> 01:43:08,143
[SPEAKER_04]: 45 seconds for point eight, it is winning time.

1403
01:43:12,504 --> 01:43:13,424
[SPEAKER_04]: McKelvin to inbound.

1404
01:43:14,495 --> 01:43:18,316
[SPEAKER_04]: Baudette, long pass, tipped.

1405
01:43:20,457 --> 01:43:23,497
[SPEAKER_04]: Swinging it around, three pointer up, no good.

1406
01:43:23,838 --> 01:43:30,199
[SPEAKER_04]: Offensive rebound, step in, another three from Little, is good!

1407
01:43:30,219 --> 01:43:34,160
[SPEAKER_04]: 44-43 and it's a one point game.

1408
01:43:35,121 --> 01:43:39,742
[SPEAKER_03]: London doing everything in their power to give this game away in the last 30 seconds.

1409
01:43:40,938 --> 01:43:41,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1410
01:43:42,439 --> 01:43:45,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Second, third chance scoring opportunities off the inbounds.

1411
01:43:46,441 --> 01:43:47,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Off the turnover.

1412
01:43:47,421 --> 01:43:50,202
[SPEAKER_03]: West Haven sticking to it, Casey.

1413
01:43:50,543 --> 01:43:52,424
[SPEAKER_04]: The sophomore missed both free throws.

1414
01:43:53,124 --> 01:43:55,405
[SPEAKER_04]: No bigger shot in the game than that one.

1415
01:43:55,865 --> 01:43:58,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Dramatically alters all of the strategy.

1416
01:43:58,967 --> 01:44:02,608
[SPEAKER_04]: And give credit to Tillman for finding the open man.

1417
01:44:02,869 --> 01:44:09,732
[SPEAKER_04]: Because now, it is a, not only is it a one possession game, it is a one possession game where you cannot

1418
01:44:10,312 --> 01:44:12,556
[SPEAKER_04]: be put into two possessions if you foul.

1419
01:44:12,756 --> 01:44:14,679
[SPEAKER_04]: So, New London will be in the bonus.

1420
01:44:15,019 --> 01:44:17,763
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's gonna be interesting what West Haven does.

1421
01:44:18,224 --> 01:44:21,168
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, they're gonna have to foul if they can't get the turnover.

1422
01:44:21,188 --> 01:44:24,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so they're gonna have to put someone at the line.

1423
01:44:24,293 --> 01:44:26,055
[SPEAKER_04]: But New London's gotta break pressure first.

1424
01:44:26,808 --> 01:44:27,828
[SPEAKER_04]: And they have not done that yet.

1425
01:44:27,848 --> 01:44:30,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I was going to show you get the ball across half court right now.

1426
01:44:30,129 --> 01:44:34,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's struggled the last two or three times inbound the basketball twice here on the side.

1427
01:44:34,909 --> 01:44:37,090
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once there on the off the miss.

1428
01:44:37,570 --> 01:44:42,991
[SPEAKER_04]: But that tried the cross court pass that against nine teams out of 10 is successful.

1429
01:44:43,391 --> 01:44:46,172
[SPEAKER_04]: But the length of West Haven is unique that way.

1430
01:44:46,512 --> 01:44:47,552
[SPEAKER_04]: And that ball was tipped.

1431
01:44:47,852 --> 01:44:48,452
[SPEAKER_04]: It wouldn't have been.

1432
01:44:48,472 --> 01:44:49,932
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no other team that would have tipped that ball.

1433
01:44:50,192 --> 01:44:51,632
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like you said, Ogletree fouled out.

1434
01:44:51,692 --> 01:44:52,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Roman comes in.

1435
01:44:52,413 --> 01:44:53,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Roman's got the length.

1436
01:44:53,593 --> 01:44:54,253
[SPEAKER_03]: You lose nothing there.

1437
01:44:58,338 --> 01:44:59,318
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a wire job here.

1438
01:45:01,959 --> 01:45:09,282
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I were Dave Cornish, my stomach is in Rolaids, Pepsi.

1439
01:45:09,442 --> 01:45:14,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a little Zantac action.

1440
01:45:21,066 --> 01:45:22,426
[SPEAKER_03]: The coach is on the floor, huh?

1441
01:45:25,907 --> 01:45:27,328
[SPEAKER_03]: But they put three minutes back on the clock.

1442
01:45:27,368 --> 01:45:27,888
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened here?

1443
01:45:30,999 --> 01:45:34,983
[SPEAKER_03]: can't be right.

1444
01:45:35,003 --> 01:45:37,506
[SPEAKER_04]: 28.7 seconds should be the time.

1445
01:45:38,707 --> 01:45:42,511
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't I hope they I don't know if they know that because the clock says three minutes right now now it's 301.

1446
01:45:42,571 --> 01:45:47,696
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they gonna keep the time on the floor what are they gonna do?

1447
01:45:49,317 --> 01:45:52,761
[SPEAKER_04]: They're working it's at 30 seconds now they're working it down to the to the way

1448
01:45:56,691 --> 01:45:57,612
[SPEAKER_04]: 30 seconds on the clock.

1449
01:45:57,732 --> 01:45:59,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay 30 seconds is what they put back on the clock.

1450
01:45:59,773 --> 01:46:05,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah so they went to three minutes so they could move the decimal over.

1451
01:46:05,677 --> 01:46:07,418
[SPEAKER_04]: 30 seconds McKelvin will inbound.

1452
01:46:11,021 --> 01:46:12,602
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're trying to work it out right now.

1453
01:46:13,122 --> 01:46:16,945
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know that they can get it to 29.8 unless they do it manually.

1454
01:46:16,965 --> 01:46:18,406
[SPEAKER_03]: 28.7 is what Mike DeMauro had.

1455
01:46:18,426 --> 01:46:19,707
[SPEAKER_04]: 28.7 they can't get it to that manually?

1456
01:46:19,727 --> 01:46:20,127
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on here now.

1457
01:46:22,253 --> 01:46:24,713
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a whole second and that's 1.3 seconds.

1458
01:46:24,953 --> 01:46:26,274
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to do it.

1459
01:46:26,314 --> 01:46:27,254
[SPEAKER_04]: McKelvin can inbound.

1460
01:46:27,274 --> 01:46:28,654
[SPEAKER_04]: He can run the floor and he knows it.

1461
01:46:29,594 --> 01:46:30,454
[SPEAKER_04]: He gets it to Phillips.

1462
01:46:30,954 --> 01:46:32,795
[SPEAKER_04]: Phillips breaks the pressure.

1463
01:46:36,115 --> 01:46:36,956
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooks up his dribble.

1464
01:46:39,276 --> 01:46:40,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Finds Bedek.

1465
01:46:40,636 --> 01:46:41,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Back to Phillips.

1466
01:46:44,777 --> 01:46:46,617
[SPEAKER_04]: New London ball, 16 seconds.

1467
01:46:46,657 --> 01:46:48,938
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't foul or they tried to.

1468
01:46:48,958 --> 01:46:50,138
[SPEAKER_04]: Phillips is calling for it.

1469
01:46:50,158 --> 01:46:51,138
[SPEAKER_03]: He's showing a ref his arm.

1470
01:46:53,091 --> 01:46:58,693
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to think right now, as an official, if the kid's getting bumped, there's an effort to foul.

1471
01:47:00,633 --> 01:47:01,553
[SPEAKER_03]: Roman back into the game.

1472
01:47:01,573 --> 01:47:03,474
[SPEAKER_04]: 16 seconds right now.

1473
01:47:04,014 --> 01:47:10,456
[SPEAKER_04]: New London's got to inbound it, and then not just possess it and allow the double to come, because the possession arrow favors West Haven.

1474
01:47:10,816 --> 01:47:14,997
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got to inbound it and get it into a place where they can get fouled.

1475
01:47:15,437 --> 01:47:17,458
[SPEAKER_04]: So they've got to try to inbound it long here, I think.

1476
01:47:22,957 --> 01:47:26,318
[SPEAKER_04]: They're giving the inbound to Bidette, now they're not.

1477
01:47:31,581 --> 01:47:33,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Robinson, inbound.

1478
01:47:35,743 --> 01:47:41,405
[SPEAKER_04]: And we got a foul on the floor against Roman.

1479
01:47:42,986 --> 01:47:45,307
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that'll put New London at the line to shoot two.

1480
01:47:46,278 --> 01:47:52,560
[SPEAKER_04]: No bigger free throws here because great job by Westhaven no time comes off the clock.

1481
01:47:52,820 --> 01:48:00,903
[SPEAKER_04]: It means Westhaven is going to have 16 seconds to tie or win this game depending on the free throws from Troy McKelvin Jr.

1482
01:48:05,985 --> 01:48:07,025
[SPEAKER_03]: Big shots for a sophomore.

1483
01:48:08,246 --> 01:48:08,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Man my heart is.

1484
01:48:09,006 --> 01:48:11,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah it's what a basketball game.

1485
01:48:14,853 --> 01:48:23,998
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be interesting if New London misses, if they pressure at all, or if they're going to run, you know, get back in the gate.

1486
01:48:24,018 --> 01:48:25,799
[SPEAKER_04]: 16 seconds remaining, two for McKelvin.

1487
01:48:38,146 --> 01:48:39,246
[SPEAKER_04]: First one is good.

1488
01:48:40,847 --> 01:48:41,788
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's big, partner.

1489
01:48:42,008 --> 01:48:44,089
[SPEAKER_04]: He makes this one, it guarantees

1490
01:48:46,238 --> 01:48:51,359
[SPEAKER_04]: They can't lose on a regulation shot without something funky happening.

1491
01:48:51,379 --> 01:48:52,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Warren checks into the game.

1492
01:48:54,059 --> 01:48:59,761
[SPEAKER_04]: If he misses, West Haven can tie or win on a buzzer beat.

1493
01:49:11,003 --> 01:49:12,423
[SPEAKER_04]: One more for Troy McKelvin Jr.

1494
01:49:19,856 --> 01:49:21,357
[SPEAKER_04]: It is up, and it is good.

1495
01:49:21,417 --> 01:49:22,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Whalers by three.

1496
01:49:23,498 --> 01:49:24,419
[SPEAKER_04]: 16 seconds remaining.

1497
01:49:24,859 --> 01:49:27,040
[SPEAKER_04]: Tillman with the basketball, Robinson on him.

1498
01:49:27,801 --> 01:49:29,902
[SPEAKER_04]: Westhaven needs a three-two tie.

1499
01:49:35,806 --> 01:49:36,406
[SPEAKER_04]: No good.

1500
01:49:36,967 --> 01:49:38,628
[SPEAKER_04]: Bidet with a foul.

1501
01:49:39,308 --> 01:49:46,933
[SPEAKER_04]: So with 1.7 remaining, Westhaven will go to the line to shoot two, but they're gonna have to miss the second one.

1502
01:49:47,646 --> 01:49:50,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, try to make the first one, miss the second one.

1503
01:49:55,370 --> 01:49:58,971
[SPEAKER_04]: Whalers had a chance, if they could've secured that rebound, we'd be done.

1504
01:50:01,073 --> 01:50:07,276
[SPEAKER_04]: So back to the line, Ja'Kai Little, who made the big three, but missed two free throws earlier.

1505
01:50:07,776 --> 01:50:12,178
[SPEAKER_04]: No two free throws bigger than this one, he's gonna have to make the first one and miss the second.

1506
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:24,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Little at the line with big free throws.

1507
01:50:28,303 --> 01:50:29,664
[SPEAKER_04]: First one rattles home.

1508
01:50:34,566 --> 01:50:42,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Philistin into the game, they're gonna put maximum size as they know Little has to try to intentionally miss the free throw.

1509
01:50:43,850 --> 01:50:45,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Westhaven down two, 1.7.

1510
01:50:48,362 --> 01:50:51,963
[SPEAKER_04]: Ja'Kai Little, the sophomore, needs the miss.

1511
01:50:53,363 --> 01:50:55,664
[SPEAKER_04]: The Blue Devils need the rebound.

1512
01:51:02,385 --> 01:51:02,885
[SPEAKER_04]: The miss.

1513
01:51:04,885 --> 01:51:08,046
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lane violation, it looks like, against West Haven.

1514
01:51:08,786 --> 01:51:12,527
[SPEAKER_04]: No shot, 1.7, Whalers will inbound.

1515
01:51:18,274 --> 01:51:19,415
[SPEAKER_04]: McKelvin will inbound.

1516
01:51:19,815 --> 01:51:21,956
[SPEAKER_04]: They can throw it long with 1.7.

1517
01:51:24,217 --> 01:51:26,158
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to get this inbounds, however.

1518
01:51:34,303 --> 01:51:36,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1519
01:51:36,504 --> 01:51:41,767
[SPEAKER_04]: 1.7 away from a semifinal trip to take on conference rival NFA.

1520
01:51:52,813 --> 01:51:54,454
[SPEAKER_04]: And the officials are talking it over.

1521
01:52:01,759 --> 01:52:02,899
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know what's going on.

1522
01:52:04,220 --> 01:52:05,781
[SPEAKER_04]: More problems with the crowd, it looks like.

1523
01:52:14,727 --> 01:52:17,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like they're escorting some folks out of the building.

1524
01:52:17,488 --> 01:52:19,009
[SPEAKER_04]: McKelvin will inbound with 1.7 remaining.

1525
01:52:21,195 --> 01:52:26,620
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go, can the Wailers punch their ticket to the semifinal against NFA?

1526
01:52:36,148 --> 01:52:40,091
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're sending both teams back to their benches until we can figure this out.

1527
01:52:42,338 --> 01:52:44,199
[SPEAKER_04]: While they figure this out, we're going to take a quick break.

1528
01:52:44,239 --> 01:52:45,019
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be right back.

1529
01:52:45,179 --> 01:52:46,839
[SPEAKER_04]: You're watching Game Day live on the Day.com.

1538
01:53:20,068 --> 01:53:21,168
[SPEAKER_04]: 1.7 seconds remaining.

1539
01:53:21,228 --> 01:53:22,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Whalers have the basketball.

1540
01:53:22,809 --> 01:53:26,730
[SPEAKER_04]: They merely need to inbound and maintain possession.

1541
01:53:29,450 --> 01:53:31,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Westhaven's gonna have to try to foul.

1542
01:53:37,186 --> 01:53:39,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike what was going on that was causing the delay?

1543
01:53:43,453 --> 01:53:48,218
[SPEAKER_04]: They're checking the book to see if the kid's foul right there was his fourth or his fifth.

1544
01:53:49,018 --> 01:53:54,624
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright so they're working to find out if the foul that occurred on the after the miss was his fourth or his fifth.

1545
01:53:55,185 --> 01:53:59,970
[SPEAKER_04]: It appears that they have it all figured out and maybe we can finish this thing here finally.

1546
01:54:05,786 --> 01:54:07,087
[SPEAKER_04]: So McKelvin to inbound.

1547
01:54:09,308 --> 01:54:12,990
[SPEAKER_04]: And I guess that was his fifth because coming into the game is Justice Richardson.

1548
01:54:21,235 --> 01:54:24,497
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot to go through, a lot of time here to try to get this inbound.

1549
01:54:25,017 --> 01:54:25,938
[SPEAKER_04]: McKelvin will do it.

1550
01:54:25,958 --> 01:54:28,579
[SPEAKER_04]: He can throw it long and risk the pick off.

1551
01:54:29,740 --> 01:54:31,621
[SPEAKER_04]: He does, up in the air it goes.

1552
01:54:32,621 --> 01:54:33,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Good if it goes.

1553
01:54:35,992 --> 01:54:39,834
[SPEAKER_04]: but a travel beforehand, and that's gonna be your ballgame.

1554
01:54:40,234 --> 01:54:42,135
[SPEAKER_04]: The New London High School Whalers.

1555
01:54:43,115 --> 01:54:55,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Barring, if the officials don't put time back on the clock, the travel ends it, and the Whalers have punched their ticket to the semifinals, where they'll take on NFA.

1556
01:54:58,162 --> 01:55:00,423
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless, of course, they put time back on the clock.

1557
01:55:02,144 --> 01:55:02,644
[SPEAKER_04]: If they do,

1558
01:55:03,825 --> 01:55:06,246
[SPEAKER_04]: New London simply needs to inbound it again.

1559
01:55:07,967 --> 01:55:09,267
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll find out here in a moment.

1560
01:55:26,955 --> 01:55:32,497
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna wait for the official, official, official, but it appears like they're saying time is done.

1561
01:55:40,850 --> 01:55:42,812
[SPEAKER_04]: Or not, because the players haven't left the floor yet.

1562
01:55:49,256 --> 01:55:50,957
[SPEAKER_04]: Looks like they're putting time back on the clock.

1563
01:55:51,298 --> 01:55:53,239
[SPEAKER_04]: 0.7 being put back on the clock.

1564
01:56:02,473 --> 01:56:04,113
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Whalers simply need to inbound.

1565
01:56:04,434 --> 01:56:08,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Technically .7 is not enough to catch, turn and shoot.

1566
01:56:08,515 --> 01:56:12,496
[SPEAKER_04]: So all they have to do is inbound it deep enough and this game will be over.

1567
01:56:19,338 --> 01:56:21,378
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you turn 1.7 seconds into 25 minutes?

1568
01:56:21,418 --> 01:56:22,138
[SPEAKER_04]: This is how.

1569
01:56:34,556 --> 01:56:37,337
[SPEAKER_04]: So 1.7 seconds remaining.

1570
01:56:38,378 --> 01:56:44,220
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as they allow the inbounds to happen, the Whalers simply need to have someone touch it and the clock should run out.

1571
01:56:48,842 --> 01:56:50,123
[SPEAKER_04]: So McKelvin will inbound.

1572
01:56:56,725 --> 01:57:00,267
[SPEAKER_04]: McKelvin will inbound it right in front of his bench.

1573
01:57:02,527 --> 01:57:10,293
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, shouldn't be enough time for a catch and shoot, so all it needs to be is touched and not shot towards the basket.

1574
01:57:22,021 --> 01:57:23,562
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no idea what just happened.

1575
01:57:24,883 --> 01:57:30,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Turnover, yes, because McKelvin threw it off his man, off the Blue Devil, but I don't understand why

1576
01:57:37,078 --> 01:57:38,459
[SPEAKER_04]: So now that does allow a lob.

1577
01:57:39,419 --> 01:57:40,139
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not done yet.

1578
01:57:48,083 --> 01:57:49,543
[SPEAKER_04]: West Haven can get a lob.

1579
01:57:55,566 --> 01:58:01,189
[SPEAKER_04]: And if West Haven finds a way to tie this game, this place will literally come undone.

1580
01:58:02,629 --> 01:58:04,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Not the building, but the people within it.

1581
01:58:09,711 --> 01:58:11,812
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're gonna put Baudette on the basketball.

1582
01:58:15,494 --> 01:58:16,854
[SPEAKER_04]: And everyone else has to guard.

1583
01:58:16,874 --> 01:58:19,876
[SPEAKER_04]: It should only be a tap, it should not be able to be a catch and shoot.

1584
01:58:25,279 --> 01:58:26,999
[SPEAKER_04]: Bellamy inbounds for Westhaven.

1585
01:58:31,962 --> 01:58:34,343
[SPEAKER_04]: Now Tillman will inbound for Westhaven.

1586
01:58:38,787 --> 01:58:40,408
[SPEAKER_04]: This is like the Hail Mary in football.

1587
01:58:40,968 --> 01:58:42,849
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're new London, just knock it down.

1588
01:58:43,469 --> 01:58:44,189
[SPEAKER_04]: Knock it away.

1589
01:58:46,510 --> 01:58:48,031
[SPEAKER_04]: Tillman, inbound.

1590
01:58:49,351 --> 01:58:51,112
[SPEAKER_04]: Shot is up, it's no good.

1591
01:58:51,572 --> 01:58:58,255
[SPEAKER_04]: The Wailers have held on in an incredibly weird, ugly, and sloppy finish.

1592
01:58:58,795 --> 01:59:07,999
[SPEAKER_04]: But 46-44, they are going to the semifinals to take on NFA on Tuesday, which means

1593
01:59:09,255 --> 01:59:09,455
[SPEAKER_04]: St.

1594
01:59:09,495 --> 01:59:11,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Bernard's is in the division one semis.

1595
01:59:11,957 --> 01:59:14,378
[SPEAKER_04]: New London and NFA are in the division two semis.

1596
01:59:15,479 --> 01:59:17,240
[SPEAKER_04]: Fitch is in the division three semis.

1597
01:59:18,000 --> 01:59:20,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Griswold is in the division four semis.

1598
01:59:22,090 --> 01:59:26,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Stonington, Windham, and Bacon Academy girls are in the class M semis.

1599
01:59:26,973 --> 01:59:30,315
[SPEAKER_04]: And Grasso Tech and Old Lime are in the division five semis.

1600
01:59:30,836 --> 01:59:42,784
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of ECC teams and a lot of locals looking to punch tickets come Monday and Tuesday, but we are guaranteed an ECC team in the division two finals and in the class M finals.

1601
01:59:43,244 --> 01:59:46,366
[SPEAKER_04]: An outstanding, outstanding effort from the ECC.

1602
01:59:46,866 --> 01:59:47,667
[SPEAKER_04]: The Sports Doctor.

1603
01:59:47,987 --> 01:59:53,131
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll have the Roberto's Log Cabin player of the game day, as well as coach Dave Cornish.

1604
01:59:53,952 --> 01:59:56,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, Roberto's our longtime sponsor.

1605
01:59:57,455 --> 01:59:59,236
[SPEAKER_04]: They are located in the woods of Lebanon.

1606
01:59:59,877 --> 02:00:02,018
[SPEAKER_04]: The Log Cabin, family owned and operated.

1607
02:00:02,058 --> 02:00:03,740
[SPEAKER_04]: They got great menu, wings.

1608
02:00:04,180 --> 02:00:05,721
[SPEAKER_04]: They got a great bar, great drinks.

1609
02:00:05,781 --> 02:00:07,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Go see Rob and his crew.

1610
02:00:07,723 --> 02:00:09,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Let them know that game day sent you.

1611
02:00:10,125 --> 02:00:13,388
[SPEAKER_04]: You definitely will not go wrong eating at Roberto's Log Cabin.

1612
02:00:13,408 --> 02:00:17,491
[SPEAKER_04]: So the sports doctor has our player of the game day and coach Cornish, sports doctor.

1613
02:00:18,403 --> 02:00:21,709
[SPEAKER_03]: He's our Roberto's log cabin player of the game tonight, Jameer Hall.

1614
02:00:22,310 --> 02:00:27,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Take this shirt down to Roberto's in Lebanon, free plate of wings for your family and friends.

1615
02:00:28,461 --> 02:00:28,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen.

1616
02:00:29,786 --> 02:00:31,947
[SPEAKER_03]: Next man up is the mentality of this team.

1617
02:00:32,307 --> 02:00:34,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Three big three-pointers and two charges.

1618
02:00:35,068 --> 02:00:37,088
[SPEAKER_03]: What was your mindset coming off the bench tonight?

1619
02:00:37,889 --> 02:00:40,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, I know all my seniors, we've been hooping forever.

1620
02:00:40,609 --> 02:00:41,850
[SPEAKER_01]: This could have been their last game.

1621
02:00:42,210 --> 02:00:43,290
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going home like this.

1622
02:00:43,991 --> 02:00:44,651
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going home.

1623
02:00:44,671 --> 02:00:45,031
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go.

1624
02:00:45,331 --> 02:00:46,931
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, these games aren't easy, are they?

1625
02:00:46,971 --> 02:00:48,352
[SPEAKER_03]: And it takes a team effort out there.

1626
02:00:48,692 --> 02:00:54,678
[SPEAKER_03]: When things got hard and you had to rise up and hit that big three, was there no thinking involved, just catch and shoot or what?

1627
02:00:55,078 --> 02:00:56,920
[SPEAKER_01]: No thinking, you can't think, you gotta just let it go.

1628
02:00:57,220 --> 02:01:00,183
[SPEAKER_01]: We practice hard every day, we gotta go in there, we get our reps in.

1629
02:01:00,483 --> 02:01:01,544
[SPEAKER_01]: I trust myself, come on.

1630
02:01:01,744 --> 02:01:07,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, great job out there tonight, I don't know if you know or not, but NFA has won on the other side, so you're gonna see them for the fourth time this year.

1631
02:01:08,490 --> 02:01:14,474
[SPEAKER_03]: Altona fan Jeff Brown we on the way, but I said all right coach Coach coach.

1632
02:01:14,534 --> 02:01:18,417
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you guys find a way to win this game with always going seven points in the fourth quarter?

1633
02:01:18,977 --> 02:01:21,059
[SPEAKER_02]: defense Defense that was it.

1634
02:01:21,439 --> 02:01:23,080
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I can say defense.

1635
02:01:23,220 --> 02:01:30,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're getting these toughness and defense you're getting these games close games Trusting your kids and trusting the guys out there.

1636
02:01:31,285 --> 02:01:33,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's what it takes to win a championship.

1637
02:01:33,187 --> 02:01:33,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it not?

1638
02:01:33,547 --> 02:01:33,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh

1639
02:01:33,847 --> 02:01:47,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, you gotta win close games because every team like I said from the quarterfinals on is good So you're gonna get into these kind of games So you got to be ready for you were worried about this West Haven team a little bit you and I had talked and you said you know I throw the records out they beat Glastonbury.

1640
02:01:48,359 --> 02:01:49,840
[SPEAKER_03]: This was a tough test for you guys.

1641
02:01:49,940 --> 02:01:50,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, absolutely.

1642
02:01:50,821 --> 02:01:56,545
[SPEAKER_03]: It was everything is advertised you saw it We saw every minute of it coach, you know

1643
02:01:57,543 --> 02:01:59,064
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about this league real quick.

1644
02:01:59,124 --> 02:02:01,827
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you guys are gonna face NFA in the semifinal.

1645
02:02:01,847 --> 02:02:02,627
[SPEAKER_03]: They won tonight.

1646
02:02:02,908 --> 02:02:04,609
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna see NFA for the fourth time.

1647
02:02:05,930 --> 02:02:09,193
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that mean, not only for NFA New London, but what does it mean for the ECC?

1648
02:02:09,773 --> 02:02:13,317
[SPEAKER_02]: The ECC's done a phenomenal job representing itself in this tournament.

1649
02:02:14,097 --> 02:02:19,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy for them, but one of us is gonna go home, and one of us is going to the championship.

1650
02:02:19,302 --> 02:02:21,283
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know my guys are gonna be up for the task.

1651
02:02:21,544 --> 02:02:24,526
[SPEAKER_02]: No matter if it's the fourth time, fifth time, sixth time, doesn't matter.

1652
02:02:24,566 --> 02:02:25,427
[SPEAKER_02]: My guys are gonna be ready.

1653
02:02:25,657 --> 02:02:26,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Great job tonight, Dave.

1654
02:02:26,738 --> 02:02:28,899
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a game away from a state championship.

1655
02:02:29,159 --> 02:02:33,761
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure one of the goals that you had at the beginning of the season when you first came into London.

1656
02:02:34,041 --> 02:02:34,721
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.

1657
02:02:34,941 --> 02:02:36,742
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the goal to bring it back to this city.

1658
02:02:36,942 --> 02:02:37,623
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my city.

1659
02:02:37,883 --> 02:02:39,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to represent the right way.

1660
02:02:39,524 --> 02:02:43,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, KC, the Whalers tonight in fashion on game day.

1661
02:02:44,866 --> 02:02:46,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much, Sports Doctor.

1662
02:02:46,407 --> 02:02:54,651
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll be with you Monday and Tuesday for semifinal action as long as we are granted permission, and we believe we will be.

1663
02:02:55,693 --> 02:03:04,097
[SPEAKER_04]: We are very excited about whatever we can bring you Monday and Tuesday, but the ECC so well represented as well as Eastern Connecticut in general.

1664
02:03:04,717 --> 02:03:12,520
[SPEAKER_04]: So many teams in the semis and heading to the finals will be at least a handful of ECC teams and hey, I said the knock on New London.

1665
02:03:12,901 --> 02:03:14,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they didn't know how to win the close ones.

1666
02:03:14,521 --> 02:03:16,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they won this one.

1667
02:03:17,258 --> 02:03:21,440
[SPEAKER_04]: but I would suggest this was not a blueprint for how to close out a basketball team.

1668
02:03:21,460 --> 02:03:23,521
[SPEAKER_03]: No, this is a recipe for kind of hang on a little bit.

1669
02:03:24,361 --> 02:03:35,487
[SPEAKER_03]: And West Haven's a good team, but up 44 to 40, New London made it way too interesting, made it way harder on themselves with turnovers and some sloppy play than it had to be.

1670
02:03:35,547 --> 02:03:45,772
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're going to find some of these other kids who didn't step up tonight are going to have to step up in order for them to deliver a state championship, whether it be the Savon Warren, whether it be

1671
02:03:46,532 --> 02:03:50,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Booboo Phillips, you know, but Jamiro Hall bailed them out with some big threes.

1672
02:03:51,393 --> 02:03:52,713
[SPEAKER_03]: They stayed out of foul trouble.

1673
02:03:53,053 --> 02:03:54,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Guy stayed on the court.

1674
02:03:54,114 --> 02:03:55,534
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, here's the other thing, too.

1675
02:03:55,694 --> 02:03:57,774
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Dave told you I came here to win a championship.

1676
02:03:58,134 --> 02:03:58,654
[SPEAKER_03]: He was not.

1677
02:03:58,995 --> 02:04:00,135
[SPEAKER_03]: He was very candid about that.

1678
02:04:00,615 --> 02:04:10,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, they are a semifinal victory away from a familiar foe toward heading to the Mohegan Sun with a chance at exactly that.

1679
02:04:10,297 --> 02:04:15,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody from the ECC is going to be competing for the Division two championship.

1680
02:04:15,178 --> 02:04:16,118
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's great for the league.

1681
02:04:16,758 --> 02:04:23,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I think all these, Griswold winning tonight, NFA winning tonight, you know, Fitch in the semifinal, obviously St.

1682
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:27,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Bernard's up against a very, very tough East Catholic team who I think beat them this year.

1683
02:04:27,542 --> 02:04:27,682
[SPEAKER_04]: St.

1684
02:04:27,702 --> 02:04:28,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Bernard beat East Catholic.

1685
02:04:28,742 --> 02:04:29,342
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, St.

1686
02:04:29,362 --> 02:04:30,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Bernard beat East Catholic.

1687
02:04:30,082 --> 02:04:32,823
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean it's, in that division one's loaded.

1688
02:04:33,424 --> 02:04:33,844
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be great.

1689
02:04:33,904 --> 02:04:36,425
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be a great, great couple of days here.

1690
02:04:36,525 --> 02:04:37,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Follow game day Monday, Tuesday.

1691
02:04:37,945 --> 02:04:40,326
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna be somewhere bringing you all of the action that we can.

1692
02:04:40,886 --> 02:04:46,316
[SPEAKER_04]: For the sports doctor Keith O'Brien and all of the Gameday crew, it's signing off from the John T. Conway Gymnasium.

1693
02:04:46,336 --> 02:04:48,320
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been watching Gameday Live on day.com.

1694
02:05:15,078 --> 02:05:15,280
you
