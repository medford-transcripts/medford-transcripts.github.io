1
00:00:00,091 --> 00:00:04,493
November, December 18th meeting of the Medford Bicycle Advisory Commission will come to order.

2
00:00:04,953 --> 00:00:06,433
Secretary, would you please call the roll?

3
00:00:07,634 --> 00:00:08,614
Jaron Powell.

4
00:00:11,475 --> 00:00:11,815
Present.

5
00:00:13,636 --> 00:00:14,316
Bruce Kulik.

6
00:00:14,577 --> 00:00:14,957
Present.

7
00:00:16,157 --> 00:00:16,937
Emily O'Brien.

8
00:00:17,438 --> 00:00:17,678
Here.

9
00:00:17,698 --> 00:00:19,899
Ernie Monier.

10
00:00:19,919 --> 00:00:23,360
That is a ghastly looking me, isn't it?

11
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:28,862
Doug Packer, who I don't see.

12
00:00:30,637 --> 00:00:32,078
Daniel Nuzzo-Muller, present.

13
00:00:33,119 --> 00:00:35,941
Noam Raveni, present.

14
00:00:38,483 --> 00:00:43,466
Mary-Kate Gustafson-Quiet, who I also don't see.

15
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:44,988
Lea Grazi.

16
00:00:45,008 --> 00:00:55,335
Okay, and Rebecca Wright, who I don't see.

17
00:00:57,396 --> 00:00:57,837
Okie dokes.

18
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,581
And no guests as of this moment.

19
00:01:06,303 --> 00:01:10,886
So do we have a motion to approve the previous minutes?

20
00:01:11,527 --> 00:01:13,508
And are there any questions about the minutes?

21
00:01:13,528 --> 00:01:15,470
Do we have a second?

22
00:01:17,651 --> 00:01:18,172
Seconded.

23
00:01:19,292 --> 00:01:19,913
All in favor?

24
00:01:20,874 --> 00:01:21,634
Aye.

25
00:01:22,355 --> 00:01:23,696
Okay, minutes approved.

26
00:01:23,736 --> 00:01:24,116
Thank you.

27
00:01:25,397 --> 00:01:28,059
Next up is announcements.

28
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:31,472
Bruce, I think you had one.

29
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:36,859
You might have to send that link one more time because I'm not sure if the people who came in after you sent it.

30
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:37,941
Really?

31
00:01:38,041 --> 00:01:39,082
Okay.

32
00:01:39,123 --> 00:01:39,543
I don't know.

33
00:01:39,563 --> 00:01:43,048
I mean, Bruce sent a link to the chat.

34
00:01:43,469 --> 00:01:44,130
You got three of them.

35
00:01:46,077 --> 00:01:52,539
Yeah, so, okay, so this came into my email box and I followed it because I said, oh, that's kind of interesting.

36
00:01:53,339 --> 00:01:58,221
And it's basically, it was done by someone at the Harvard Crimson, and it's pretty well done.

37
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:05,183
They took four or five intersections around the Harvard area and just did some discussion about it.

38
00:02:05,863 --> 00:02:17,394
Didn't offer any solutions, but simply pointed out what they viewed as some issues with them and questions and was sort of a, let's talk about this article.

39
00:02:18,034 --> 00:02:21,197
The reason I brought it up is because I thought it was interesting to kind of.

40
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:38,608
see what the discussion was and some of the points that were made regarding what's good what's bad about particular infrastructure and I also thought not that we've ever been able to really kind of do something like that with any kind of regularity but

41
00:02:39,498 --> 00:02:54,832
It does make for an interesting, we could have discussions about intersections in our area as well with either hints about how to get through them or what we ought to do about them or pointing out issues with them, whatever.

42
00:02:55,352 --> 00:02:56,974
It was just sort of food for thought.

43
00:02:57,414 --> 00:03:03,859
And I just threw in the announcements because I thought it would be something that on our own time, we can all do a quick run through.

44
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:18,011
If anyone has it open, you can see that if you browse down quickly, there's a handful of little maps that have been put together, depicting the layout of the infrastructure, and then some verbiage about what's good, what's bad about it, and so on.

45
00:03:18,211 --> 00:03:19,132
So there you have it.

46
00:03:20,253 --> 00:03:20,713
That's great.

47
00:03:20,753 --> 00:03:21,053
Thank you.

48
00:03:21,394 --> 00:03:22,895
That makes me wonder if maybe we could

49
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:28,638
interest somebody at the Tufts daily into doing something similar?

50
00:03:28,658 --> 00:03:30,522
Oh, that sounds fun.

51
00:03:31,463 --> 00:03:34,849
I mean, at least at Boston and college, maybe at other places.

52
00:03:34,869 --> 00:03:35,450
Yeah, for example.

53
00:03:35,871 --> 00:03:36,031
Yeah.

54
00:03:38,942 --> 00:03:57,810
Another announcement is there were a couple of incidents over the last several months where one member, first it was Jared who had had a bad experience with an irate driver harassing him and his family while they were on their bikes.

55
00:03:58,130 --> 00:04:03,632
He wrote an e-mail to the mayor and a bunch of city officials and police department and so forth.

56
00:04:04,874 --> 00:04:11,693
And that email thread had petered down a little bit, and then another member of the commission had another bad...

57
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:24,411
incident with somebody harassing her for the same kind of thing, like not getting the HE double hockey sticks out of the way fast enough when there's parked cars and nowhere to go.

58
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:35,053
And that kind of sparked off another discussion, among which was Chief Buckley had written back to me and offered to meet.

59
00:04:35,993 --> 00:04:41,877
And I emailed back several times and never got a response when I emailed back saying, OK, let's set up a time.

60
00:04:41,897 --> 00:04:48,102
So I emailed back again thinking, well, maybe my messages are all going to spam.

61
00:04:48,142 --> 00:04:49,863
And I wrote back to the whole group.

62
00:04:50,224 --> 00:04:59,130
And the mayor wrote back to me and also to the chief and said, let's try to get on this and pursue a meeting time after the holidays.

63
00:05:00,451 --> 00:05:14,304
This is all to just kind of fill you in on this, even though nothing much has come of it, but that those officials are aware of the kinds of incidents that I think we've all seen and heard about.

64
00:05:15,865 --> 00:05:22,792
And I hope that we can at some point get a meeting and get closer relationship with the police department.

65
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:35,539
One, I think an important thing for us in Medford in particular, is that we have so many important through streets that are just too narrow to have bike lanes.

66
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:40,400
And in some cases, too narrow to have bike lanes in both directions.

67
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,542
In some cases, too narrow to have bike lanes in any direction.

68
00:05:44,783 --> 00:05:50,688
We are going to be in the travel lane for the foreseeable future in a lot of important places that we need to go.

69
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:57,813
And we know that speeding and speed enforcement is an issue.

70
00:06:01,336 --> 00:06:16,625
you know short basically short of making important throughways one way there just is not going to be space for bike facilities so sort of regardless of how anybody does or doesn't feel about the idea of vehicular cycling

71
00:06:17,385 --> 00:06:26,730
This is what we're left with in a lot of places and I think that's disproportionately the case in Medford as opposed to in Somerville and Cambridge that have a lot of these roads that were wider to start with.

72
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:36,315
So you have the option of reducing a travel lane, but if you only ever have one traveling to start with, you can't you can't do lane reductions there.

73
00:06:36,335 --> 00:06:37,116
So.

74
00:06:39,443 --> 00:06:59,115
The point that I'm getting at is I think it really is especially important that we be in contact with law enforcement in Medford because we know that the education and enforcement aspects of this are especially important to us because we don't really have

75
00:07:00,676 --> 00:07:07,779
We don't really have prospects of separated bike infrastructure in a lot of these places, and they're not easy to avoid.

76
00:07:07,799 --> 00:07:13,680
This is to fill you in on, hopefully, we will get that meeting.

77
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,261
Hopefully, we'll get something.

78
00:07:15,801 --> 00:07:19,903
If we get a time that he can only meet with one person, that's great.

79
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:22,883
If we can get him to come to a whole meeting, that would be even better.

80
00:07:23,524 --> 00:07:25,924
If we can get a couple of people to meet, that would be great.

81
00:07:27,645 --> 00:07:31,714
I haven't gotten anything concrete yet, so I don't really have anything else for you.

82
00:07:31,734 --> 00:07:34,219
I hope that at some point I do have something.

83
00:07:35,141 --> 00:07:37,446
Leah, I saw your hand up and then Ernie afterwards.

84
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:58,216
Yeah, I was just wondering if we've ever sort of published our goals and asks that we came up with a couple months ago in a public place, because I know having a regular meeting with the police department was one of those so that we could give them credit for when they do set up a meeting.

85
00:07:58,456 --> 00:08:01,477
Yeah, thanks.

86
00:08:02,197 --> 00:08:04,557
I did send that to various people by email.

87
00:08:04,617 --> 00:08:07,758
I think we may not have actually gotten it up on the website, but we should do that.

88
00:08:08,578 --> 00:08:08,998
for sure.

89
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:10,760
Um Ernie?

90
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:23,909
Yeah we've batted this around for a long time and almost had a liaison officer who um you know between the schools and us as an example who wanted to get more involved.

91
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:28,212
I don't know if he still does but uh and to maybe attend

92
00:08:29,435 --> 00:08:36,716
regularly, whatever that means, are meetings as a formal liaison between the police department, the city, and us.

93
00:08:37,237 --> 00:08:52,280
I think that's a path we should grease and not outside meeting, hang on, between people like the chair who makes inquiries on the side and gets the mayor involved, et cetera.

94
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,640
We should have a formal

95
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,641
liaison to do this.

96
00:08:55,981 --> 00:09:03,944
I want to back up to what Bruce was saying about data feedback from our own site visits to problem areas.

97
00:09:04,405 --> 00:09:15,430
That seems like a natural information-getting methodology for developing master plan items, right?

98
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:31,053
group of people study a problem site using whatever model, like the Harvard one you found, and that can then lead up to a major suggestion and project for the master plan.

99
00:09:31,433 --> 00:09:36,814
So I like that idea, especially it can be implemented in that way.

100
00:09:37,814 --> 00:09:40,855
So my suggestion is we get

101
00:09:42,255 --> 00:09:49,557
that we answer Buckley first if this is an ongoing lube and ask him to attend a meeting.

102
00:09:50,837 --> 00:09:56,299
So I did mention that, and I mentioned that I wanted to set up a time.

103
00:09:57,019 --> 00:09:58,920
And he just doesn't get back to me.

104
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:10,823
And this has been the issue with the other times that I've reached out to people at the police department is I'll get an answer the first time, and then I follow up, and then it's crickets.

105
00:10:11,743 --> 00:10:20,505
And so I hope that if I can get the mayor to give them enough of a nudge, then eventually we can get something out of that.

106
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:31,686
But that's just to sort of fill you in on where we are with that particular thing, because it has been going on a little bit in the background.

107
00:10:31,746 --> 00:10:40,328
It started out as just Jared having a horrible day and contacting all of these people on his own behalf.

108
00:10:41,128 --> 00:10:54,502
But in addition to just firefighting in this way or narrow, not important topics, but we could also make it easy for Buckley by asking him to appoint someone to talk to us.

109
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:57,280
Because she's too busy.

110
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:01,402
So there's a couple of things that I think it really is actually important to talk to him.

111
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:11,869
One is that we need to talk about what kind of training Medford officers receive in bike law and bike strategies and safe bicycling.

112
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:17,972
The conversations that I have had sometimes with police officers, not just in Medford, but in other places, is

113
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:26,174
If they don't have specific training on that, they don't know any more about it than anybody else, which is not surprising.

114
00:11:26,954 --> 00:11:28,415
That's exactly what you would expect.

115
00:11:28,955 --> 00:11:31,935
And what most people know about that is not really a lot.

116
00:11:32,636 --> 00:11:44,258
So they will say things like, well, just get over to the right for your own safety under circumstances where that is absolutely emphatically not a safe thing to do because there's nowhere to go.

117
00:11:45,592 --> 00:11:54,717
And where that might actually, even if you're being harassed in that moment, moving over to squeeze to the right might actually be worse.

118
00:11:55,657 --> 00:12:00,239
But they haven't been trained on the reasons why that might or might not be good advice.

119
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:03,661
And they don't know any more than anybody else if they don't receive that training.

120
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:04,482
So that's one thing.

121
00:12:04,982 --> 00:12:08,984
And then the other thing is the crash reporting like Leah just posted into the chat is,

122
00:12:11,619 --> 00:12:33,206
There needs to be a system for that, and I wonder if there's also a way of coming up with a system for reporting harassment incidents, even things that don't result in crashes, because these are also, you know, the crashes are the really rare things, but the harassment is really not that rare, and we would certainly like it to be a lot more rare than it is.

123
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:56,172
Again, I'm just going to suggest that we somehow make a motion to contact the police department to delegate a liaison officer to periodically attend our meetings to collect information, our complaints, and put together strategies to move forward.

124
00:12:56,928 --> 00:12:59,669
Otherwise, it's going to be continued happenstance.

125
00:13:00,329 --> 00:13:05,890
I mean, we can do that, but I have been emailing and following up and haven't gotten replies.

126
00:13:05,971 --> 00:13:14,693
But if we send it to the police department through the mayor's office, maybe we get a little bit more juice.

127
00:13:14,813 --> 00:13:17,534
I mean, it hasn't worked yet, so maybe that's worth a try.

128
00:13:17,554 --> 00:13:18,174
Let me get Bruce.

129
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:24,550
Hey, yeah, so 1st of all, Emily, I want to thank you for doing all that work.

130
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:28,193
I know it's a lot of follow up work and it sounds like there's at least.

131
00:13:29,622 --> 00:13:33,744
a notion of some motion with them, which is better than we've had in the past.

132
00:13:33,784 --> 00:13:42,427
I mean, the fact that the chief himself is actually contacted rather than a lieutenant of some sort is actually, I think, a good sign.

133
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:44,248
At least, I think it's a good sign.

134
00:13:44,288 --> 00:13:52,411
I'm assuming that the conversation was cordial and inviting to discuss issues as opposed to, oh, what's this all about?

135
00:13:54,112 --> 00:13:55,093
Yeah.

136
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:57,034
All I've gotten was very short emails.

137
00:13:57,114 --> 00:13:58,836
It was not combative in any way.

138
00:13:58,896 --> 00:14:00,777
It was not a problem.

139
00:14:00,838 --> 00:14:03,059
It was we take this seriously and we want to talk to you.

140
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:03,980
Right.

141
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:10,206
The fact that the mayor is also interested, I think that really shows some good motion on the part of the city.

142
00:14:10,226 --> 00:14:11,907
Yeah.

143
00:14:12,488 --> 00:14:20,675
I would look forward to having a one-on-one meeting starting with the chief if he's available so that we can have a frank conversation about

144
00:14:21,994 --> 00:14:24,075
what do we want as far as policy goes?

145
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:26,175
What do we want as far as education goes?

146
00:14:26,235 --> 00:14:28,336
Because I think that's the big thing.

147
00:14:28,376 --> 00:14:30,956
We need to know that we're supported.

148
00:14:31,917 --> 00:14:37,478
And if we make a complaint to the police, at a minimum, it'll be noted.

149
00:14:37,498 --> 00:14:43,920
And preferably, if we get a license plate, et cetera, a polite phone call.

150
00:14:44,749 --> 00:14:51,992
Right, which is simply, you know, informing them of what the role, the rights of cyclists are.

151
00:14:52,112 --> 00:14:55,913
And in many cases, that would be enough to let somebody say.

152
00:14:56,873 --> 00:14:57,994
Yeah, absolutely.

153
00:14:58,754 --> 00:15:03,196
And especially, you know, 1 common 1 common element of a lot of these incidents.

154
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:15,584
that, and I've heard this and I know other people have heard this too, is a driver screaming at the cyclist saying, I'm driving perfectly legally, I'm doing everything I'm supposed to be doing, get out of the way.

155
00:15:16,104 --> 00:15:16,945
But in fact, they're not.

156
00:15:17,245 --> 00:15:19,446
In fact, they're not.

157
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:28,972
Maybe they're just saying that and they know they're wrong, but I think that most people who put it in that way are not saying that thinking that it's not true.

158
00:15:29,012 --> 00:15:29,613
You know what I mean?

159
00:15:29,633 --> 00:15:32,195
I think they believe what they're saying.

160
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:36,082
And so I think that's an important thing.

161
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:57,743
I also have to wonder, you know, for all of the times that I know I or somebody else has had a bad experience and called the police department to report something like this, how often does a driver have some cyclist in the road in front of them and they get pissed off and they call the police department saying, you guys got to do something about these cyclists in the road.

162
00:15:58,935 --> 00:16:04,019
I bet that does happen, and I wonder what the police tell that person.

163
00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:15,507
Do they tell that person, oh, that person has a right to be there and they have good reasons to be there, or do they tell them, well, that person should get out of your way, essentially?

164
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:18,669
These are all mystery things.

165
00:16:19,069 --> 00:16:22,892
I appreciate that the department is at least making

166
00:16:24,893 --> 00:16:25,653
What's the word I want?

167
00:16:26,033 --> 00:16:27,434
Outreach, I guess is the word.

168
00:16:27,494 --> 00:16:27,955
Yeah.

169
00:16:27,975 --> 00:16:29,996
I do hope that we're able to get something together.

170
00:16:30,016 --> 00:16:31,637
You said after the holidays?

171
00:16:32,297 --> 00:16:32,578
Yeah.

172
00:16:32,598 --> 00:16:35,539
The mayor said we'll try to help make something work after the holidays.

173
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:41,603
I have a fairly flexible schedule most of the time.

174
00:16:43,905 --> 00:16:48,228
If he offers a time, I will do my best to make that time work.

175
00:16:49,268 --> 00:16:50,289
I'm available to it.

176
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:52,370
I would like to extend as possible.

177
00:16:52,410 --> 00:16:53,271
Yeah.

178
00:16:53,631 --> 00:16:56,773
If it's a time that other people can make it, then that would be great.

179
00:16:56,813 --> 00:16:59,634
If it's a time that I can't make it and somebody else can, that would be great.

180
00:17:00,255 --> 00:17:08,740
I feel like I want to make this as easy as possible for them and just be as accommodating as possible to make this happen.

181
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,321
Thanks again for your efforts on this.

182
00:17:11,361 --> 00:17:13,102
I appreciate it.

183
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:17,805
This is obviously anecdotal experience, but the times I've had interaction with

184
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:31,554
Medford or Winchester police around bike safety, there hasn't appeared to be a large awareness of the vulnerable road user law, right, which is kind of new and goes hand in hand with all the signage and stuff.

185
00:17:31,614 --> 00:17:47,339
So I suppose just to maybe refine the question around training, helping to get a better understanding from the police department, and maybe this is also a statewide policy thing, but what's actionable in a situation like that and how is that

186
00:17:47,924 --> 00:17:51,887
Law enforcement or how is it used and, you know, maybe to the point Bruce is making right?

187
00:17:51,927 --> 00:17:56,950
Is there a road safety brochure that people can can receive?

188
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:04,415
Because the experience I always had is like, if the responding officer didn't see it, it might as well have not happened in terms of public records.

189
00:18:04,435 --> 00:18:05,876
Yeah, that's the case with a lot of stuff.

190
00:18:06,637 --> 00:18:09,759
And what I have also been told is that they.

191
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:26,791
is that the law is such that in order to take any official action, and I don't know if there's a place in this for the polite phone call, but if they didn't see it and you don't have a video,

192
00:18:27,932 --> 00:18:34,497
then they can't do anything or they can't issue a ticket or anything like that.

193
00:18:34,537 --> 00:18:37,279
And if they can't issue a ticket, they don't feel like making the phone call.

194
00:18:37,719 --> 00:18:46,546
I don't know if they can make a phone call and give verbal instructions without the threat of issuing a ticket or something.

195
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:48,258
That's an interesting point.

196
00:18:48,298 --> 00:18:50,219
I'd like to get that clarified if possible.

197
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:53,962
And maybe it's more of a legal thing than it is a law enforcement thing.

198
00:18:54,002 --> 00:18:55,764
But if they can't issue a ticket.

199
00:18:59,252 --> 00:19:02,934
Can they even go so far as to harass someone or warn them?

200
00:19:02,974 --> 00:19:03,094
Right.

201
00:19:03,354 --> 00:19:05,436
Run the plate and call them up on the phone or something.

202
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:23,546
I'd like to know, and I don't know if this is kind of a legal gray area where they don't feel like calling somebody on the phone if they don't have any jurisdiction to write a ticket or something, so they don't feel like it's worth the trouble to call them up because they're not going to do anything, or if it's that they can't actually.

203
00:19:23,566 --> 00:19:24,307
Right.

204
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:32,363
So that's another question, but I think it is really important to have a discussion about that.

205
00:19:32,603 --> 00:19:44,351
So in the meantime, I think it's not going to be until after the holidays that we get a meeting time, but it could end up being in January before our next meeting happens.

206
00:19:44,952 --> 00:19:46,012
So in that case,

207
00:19:47,413 --> 00:19:59,217
Anybody who's here or who's following this later, send me any bullet points you have just so that I go with as much input from the group as possible.

208
00:20:00,017 --> 00:20:05,539
Any things that you want to make sure get covered if I get that meeting, and I hope that we'll have more than just me there.

209
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:13,142
Send me your comments just so that I have as much to bring as I can.

210
00:20:17,058 --> 00:20:17,258
Ernie?

211
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:18,739
Yeah, two things.

212
00:20:19,459 --> 00:20:29,664
In my case, I recalled as it happened to me that the police will retroactively cite you in an altercation even though there's no witness.

213
00:20:30,304 --> 00:20:35,846
If there's a particular piece of legal information, they can strap onto it.

214
00:20:36,687 --> 00:20:40,989
What happened to me is I was in an accident with someone in a crosswalk.

215
00:20:41,877 --> 00:20:46,579
wasn't witnessed, as far as the police were concerned, they weren't there.

216
00:20:47,099 --> 00:20:54,061
I was retroactively cited and had to spend $1,500 to get a lawyer to find a witness who proved in court that I was not

217
00:21:01,359 --> 00:21:04,020
viable in that the ticket was then revoked.

218
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,401
So they can, in a way, act arbitrarily.

219
00:21:07,961 --> 00:21:09,842
That was five or seven years ago.

220
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:13,483
Although I don't know if that's- Was that as a cyclist or as a motor vehicle operator?

221
00:21:13,643 --> 00:21:18,805
I was a motor vehicle operator, and this was a pedestrian, ran into my car.

222
00:21:19,285 --> 00:21:24,887
And because it was a crosswalk, the police decided to retroactively issue a ticket.

223
00:21:25,627 --> 00:21:26,868
Interesting.

224
00:21:27,508 --> 00:21:28,608
Interesting.

225
00:21:28,668 --> 00:21:31,370
And it costs a lot, you know, time and money to get fixed.

226
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:35,671
But I don't want to harp on that because I know our time is wasted.

227
00:21:35,972 --> 00:21:39,073
But I worry again, Emily, about, well, two things.

228
00:21:39,793 --> 00:21:41,234
The bandwidth of the captain.

229
00:21:41,574 --> 00:21:44,115
getting time, getting the sit down.

230
00:21:44,475 --> 00:21:53,138
Yeah, you deal with the leader, but I'm hoping they can delegate someone who can be there routinely for us at our meetings.

231
00:21:53,799 --> 00:21:57,820
I don't want to mention it many more times, but I think that should be stressed.

232
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:09,385
As well, if you are no longer the chairman of the group and you're meeting later with the mayor, can you speak for MBAC with the strength of the mayor's office as the commission chair?

233
00:22:10,205 --> 00:22:13,388
Is that even a question that's pertinent here?

234
00:22:14,188 --> 00:22:15,850
I guess, well, two things.

235
00:22:16,350 --> 00:22:23,796
One is getting a liaison to come to our meetings is one of the things that I plan to ask him for.

236
00:22:23,816 --> 00:22:25,818
Yeah.

237
00:22:26,098 --> 00:22:34,024
That is something that we can add to the list, but definitely send me an e-mail to that effect so that I have it.

238
00:22:34,825 --> 00:22:37,907
And I have it in writing that you wanted that.

239
00:22:38,787 --> 00:22:41,468
And we have talked about that before.

240
00:22:41,508 --> 00:22:42,849
And I do think that's important.

241
00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:51,694
But in terms of having a reporting system and having a policy about training, that really is something that has to go to the police chief first.

242
00:22:54,776 --> 00:22:57,818
Does the traffic commission track these kinds of incidents?

243
00:22:57,878 --> 00:23:01,000
I know they have metrics about car accidents and stuff.

244
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:16,710
What I have been told is that, and this is why I want a tracking system for harassment incidents, is everything is different if there's not actually a crash.

245
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:23,160
And so this is what Ernie was saying, that is an actual impact.

246
00:23:23,401 --> 00:23:27,531
And so they know that something happened because two things got.

247
00:23:29,004 --> 00:23:30,505
actually physically collided.

248
00:23:31,846 --> 00:23:40,373
But we want to reduce the things that most of the time are not crashes, but a small percent of the time could be crashes.

249
00:23:40,994 --> 00:23:42,555
That's how you reduce the crashes.

250
00:23:43,476 --> 00:23:48,139
And these harassment incidents, most of the time, nobody actually gets hurt.

251
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,381
But it's really unpleasant.

252
00:23:50,441 --> 00:23:51,221
It's really scary.

253
00:23:51,721 --> 00:24:04,528
And it also means that those are the things that encourage cyclists to ride in the door zone and to ride in places where they're liable to get right hooked and T-boned and stuff because they're scared of people harassing them from coming up from behind.

254
00:24:05,428 --> 00:24:10,311
And if we're not paying attention to those incidents, then we get more crashes.

255
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:14,273
I think it's also a key reason why many people choose not to cycle.

256
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:22,756
You're not genuinely afraid of getting injured, but they are afraid of being harassed, which is uncomfortable, as we all know.

257
00:24:24,178 --> 00:24:31,185
Even if you have a steel will, it's sort of annoying to get into a verbal altercation with someone.

258
00:24:31,766 --> 00:24:33,007
Yeah, nobody wants to be there.

259
00:24:33,067 --> 00:24:33,548
It sucks.

260
00:24:35,418 --> 00:24:39,620
So hopefully we get something out of that.

261
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:47,203
As to whether I can speak for the commission, I have two suggestions on that count.

262
00:24:47,583 --> 00:24:54,506
One is that I will certainly be in contact with whoever my successor is and we'll work together on this and hopefully that person will be able to come too.

263
00:24:56,507 --> 00:25:02,109
The other is that we could also make a motion to say that I can speak for the commission at this meeting should it come about.

264
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:03,430
So moved.

265
00:25:04,615 --> 00:25:05,496
Yeah, seconded.

266
00:25:07,837 --> 00:25:08,357
All in favor?

267
00:25:08,397 --> 00:25:08,477
Aye.

268
00:25:09,598 --> 00:25:09,658
Aye.

269
00:25:09,678 --> 00:25:09,758
Aye.

Aye.

276

Aye.

277
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:12,219
Aye.

278

Aye.

Aye.

280
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:12,800
Aye.

281
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:12,960
Aye.

282
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,080
Aye.

283
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,200
Aye.

284
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:13,420
Aye.

285
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:13,780
Aye.

286
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:13,900
Aye.

287
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:14,080
Aye.

288
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:14,240
Aye.

289
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:14,320
Aye.

290
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:14,421
Aye.

291
00:25:14,441 --> 00:25:14,561
Aye.

292
00:25:14,581 --> 00:25:14,641
Aye.

293
00:25:14,661 --> 00:25:14,721
Aye.

294
00:25:14,741 --> 00:25:14,801
Aye.

295
00:25:14,821 --> 00:25:14,941
Aye.

296
00:25:15,001 --> 00:25:15,081
Aye.

297
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:16,121
Aye.

298
00:25:16,141 --> 00:25:16,202
Aye.

299
00:25:16,222 --> 00:25:16,302
Aye.

300
00:25:16,322 --> 00:25:16,382
Aye.

301
00:25:16,402 --> 00:25:16,462
Aye.

302
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:16,602
Aye.

303
00:25:16,622 --> 00:25:16,762
Aye.

304
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:16,862
Aye.

305
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:16,962
Aye.

306
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:17,062
Aye.

307
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:17,182
Aye.

308
00:25:17,202 --> 00:25:17,302
Aye.

309
00:25:17,322 --> 00:25:17,382
Aye.

310
00:25:17,542 --> 00:25:17,642
Aye.

311
00:25:17,662 --> 00:25:17,722
Aye.

312
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:18,083
Aye.

313
00:25:18,103 --> 00:25:18,163
Aye.

314
00:25:18,203 --> 00:25:18,283
Aye.

315
00:25:18,303 --> 00:25:18,423
Aye.

316
00:25:18,443 --> 00:25:18,743
Aye.

317
00:25:18,763 --> 00:25:18,843
Aye.

318
00:25:18,863 --> 00:25:18,923
Aye.

319
00:25:19,263 --> 00:25:19,323
Aye.

320
00:25:19,343 --> 00:25:19,403
Aye.

321
00:25:19,423 --> 00:25:19,523
Aye.

322
00:25:19,764 --> 00:25:19,844
Aye.

323
00:25:19,864 --> 00:25:19,924
Aye.

324
00:25:19,944 --> 00:25:20,004
Aye.

325
00:25:20,024 --> 00:25:20,084
Aye.

326
00:25:20,104 --> 00:25:20,224
Aye.

327
00:25:20,244 --> 00:25:20,424
Aye.

328
00:25:20,444 --> 00:25:20,504
Aye.

329
00:25:20,524 --> 00:25:20,604
Aye.

330
00:25:20,624 --> 00:25:20,684
Aye.

331
00:25:20,704 --> 00:25:20,764
Aye.

332
00:25:21,565 --> 00:25:21,725
Aye.

333
00:25:21,745 --> 00:25:21,825
Aye.

334
00:25:21,845 --> 00:25:22,345
Aye.

335
00:25:22,365 --> 00:25:22,425
Aye.

336
00:25:22,865 --> 00:25:22,945
Aye.

337
00:25:22,965 --> 00:25:23,025
Aye.

338
00:25:23,045 --> 00:25:23,105
Aye.

339
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:23,225
Aye.

340
00:25:23,325 --> 00:25:23,406
Aye.

341
00:25:23,426 --> 00:25:23,546
Aye.

342
00:25:23,626 --> 00:25:23,726
Aye.

343
00:25:23,786 --> 00:25:23,926
Aye.

344
00:25:23,946 --> 00:25:24,046
Aye.

345
00:25:24,086 --> 00:25:24,186
Aye.

346
00:25:24,206 --> 00:25:24,286
Aye.

347
00:25:24,346 --> 00:25:24,486
Aye.

348
00:25:24,526 --> 00:25:24,746
Aye.

349
00:25:24,766 --> 00:25:24,826
Aye.

350
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:25,267
Aye.

351
00:25:25,347 --> 00:25:25,427
Aye.

352
00:25:25,447 --> 00:25:25,507
Aye.

353
00:25:25,527 --> 00:25:25,647
Aye.

354
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:25,747
Aye.

355
00:25:25,847 --> 00:25:25,987
Aye.

356
00:25:26,027 --> 00:25:26,107
Aye.

357
00:25:26,127 --> 00:25:26,207
Aye.

358
00:25:26,247 --> 00:25:26,327
Aye.

359
00:25:26,407 --> 00:25:26,507
Aye.

360
00:25:26,667 --> 00:25:26,747
Aye.

361
00:25:26,767 --> 00:25:26,827
Aye.

362
00:25:26,847 --> 00:25:26,908
Aye.

363
00:25:26,928 --> 00:25:27,068
Aye.

364
00:25:27,128 --> 00:25:27,208
Aye.

365
00:25:27,228 --> 00:25:27,288
Aye.

366
00:25:28,168 --> 00:25:28,288
Aye.

367
00:25:28,308 --> 00:25:28,388
Aye.

368
00:25:28,408 --> 00:25:28,488
Aye.

369
00:25:28,508 --> 00:25:29,429
Aye.

370
00:25:29,449 --> 00:25:29,549
Aye.

371
00:25:29,569 --> 00:25:29,629
Aye.

372
00:25:29,669 --> 00:25:29,789
Aye.

373
00:25:29,849 --> 00:25:29,989
Aye.

374
00:25:30,009 --> 00:25:30,109
Aye

375
00:25:34,882 --> 00:25:42,029
Sorry, I put a question in the chat about your email because it's remembered like 3 different versions of the same.

376
00:25:42,169 --> 00:25:42,830
They're all me.

377
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:43,651
Okay.

378
00:25:44,712 --> 00:25:44,912
Great.

379
00:25:45,713 --> 00:25:46,894
They're all, they're all fine.

380
00:25:47,054 --> 00:25:48,616
Don't ask how many emails I have.

381
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:57,565
And so the next thing on our agenda is electing new officers.

382
00:26:00,123 --> 00:26:08,511
I did, by the way, check that and I checked in with the mayor's office.

383
00:26:09,719 --> 00:26:20,148
And they said that if we want to have co-officers for anything, she's seen co-officers of various kinds before, and she knows of no rule against it.

384
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:30,797
So if that makes anyone a little bit more willing to take on any of those roles, we can do that.

385
00:26:33,378 --> 00:26:46,622
I guess the one caveat is we couldn't have co-chairs and co-vice chairs and co-secretaries and only have 11 commissioners because that would constitute a quorum and that would be too many.

386
00:26:48,162 --> 00:26:54,804
Short of that, I think we could actually split those jobs if we want.

387
00:26:54,944 --> 00:26:59,965
Do we have any comments, discussion, nominations for any of those three positions?

388
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:14,086
I guess one other thing is if you take on any one of those positions, for example, in some ways, the one that's the most demanding on a specific schedule is usually the secretary.

389
00:27:15,847 --> 00:27:23,472
If you take on that job, it doesn't necessarily mean that you personally have to do it all the time, every time.

390
00:27:23,993 --> 00:27:27,014
You just have to make sure that somebody else does it if you're not going to.

391
00:27:28,147 --> 00:27:35,117
So, if you think you might be interested in being secretary, but you know that you can't make it to every single meeting.

392
00:27:36,119 --> 00:27:45,723
you totally can still be secretary as long as you just find somebody else to take the notes when you can't be there and make sure that the meeting gets announced when it needs to.

393
00:27:45,863 --> 00:27:48,764
And if you can't do that yourself, then make sure that somebody else does it.

394
00:27:49,564 --> 00:27:52,525
And I think the same is true with chairing the meetings.

395
00:27:53,946 --> 00:28:02,329
Even if there's not a co-chair or a vice chair or a co-vice chair or anything like that, it is fine for somebody else to run the meeting.

396
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:04,130
You just have to delegate somebody to do it.

397
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:07,891
So that's where that is.

398
00:28:08,052 --> 00:28:19,357
If you're feeling like you're considering doing this and that's your stumbling block, you can totally delegate some of your duties.

399
00:28:19,437 --> 00:28:22,959
It just means that it's your job to make sure that it gets done.

400
00:28:23,079 --> 00:28:24,459
Any discussion or nominations?

401
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,222
I do have one quick question, which is, do we have new people?

402
00:28:29,402 --> 00:28:31,963
I thought there were some additional people coming on board.

403
00:28:32,623 --> 00:28:36,923
So there I got, I also got a list of new applicants.

404
00:28:39,283 --> 00:28:43,165
And I haven't gotten back to the mayor's office about them yet.

405
00:28:44,146 --> 00:29:02,638
And I thought that since we're about to elect new officers in any case, and any new people wouldn't have any idea who any of us are, we might as well elect the new officers, and then I'll discuss with the new chair those applications, and then we'll go from there.

406
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,860
The spreadsheet was also like,

407
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,587
Kind of confusing.

408
00:29:10,488 --> 00:29:11,668
I was on the plane.

409
00:29:12,889 --> 00:29:14,971
And how many people are missing from today's meeting?

410
00:29:14,991 --> 00:29:19,134
Three.

411
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:20,735
Three, okay.

412
00:29:23,837 --> 00:29:25,899
Doug, Becca, Mary Kay.

413
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:29,581
So we can elect one of them chair, one vice chair, and one secretary, right?

414
00:29:29,742 --> 00:29:30,242
Excellent.

415
00:29:32,317 --> 00:29:35,558
My question is, who's volunteering for what?

416
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:46,583
And if there are no actual volunteers, you know, I'll make a suggestion for co-chairs and maybe a secretary too.

417
00:29:47,383 --> 00:29:51,005
But shouldn't we start by asking who wants to put their

418
00:29:51,653 --> 00:29:59,177
Well, I will say what I know, which is that I think Daniel is willing to be roped into being chair or co-chair.

419
00:30:00,998 --> 00:30:03,079
And Jared is happy being vice chair.

420
00:30:03,099 --> 00:30:09,463
Or not being vice chair at all, which my family might prefer.

421
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,433
What about Bruce?

422
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,615
And you have been chair and then vice chair for a while.

423
00:30:14,655 --> 00:30:16,596
So if you feel like it's your turn.

424
00:30:16,836 --> 00:30:18,117
Do you want to be secretary?

425
00:30:18,137 --> 00:30:23,020
You can trade down all the roles, do all the officer positions.

426
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:26,302
What about Bruce or Emily for co-chairing with Daniel?

427
00:30:28,244 --> 00:30:28,944
Or Jared?

428
00:30:29,865 --> 00:30:31,606
I'm just thinking about continuity.

429
00:30:32,026 --> 00:30:37,430
Yeah, I would not dismiss it, but one of the beliefs that I have

430
00:30:38,727 --> 00:30:43,323
although perhaps I shouldn't worry about this at this point, is it's important to have...

431
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:48,484
It's important to pass the championship along, if you will.

432
00:30:49,424 --> 00:30:57,246
A lot of organizations that have kind of a founder and a champion, when that champion disappears, the organization falters.

433
00:30:58,126 --> 00:31:05,748
And one of the things we did with this commission was deliberately make sure that we had people moving forward in different roles.

434
00:31:07,248 --> 00:31:13,850
That was something that I initially made sure that we set up the first time we had transitions moving forward so that there'd be a lot of different people.

435
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:23,296
Yeah, so along that line, I would not say I'm 100% against my doing it.

436
00:31:24,357 --> 00:31:28,019
I would have a preference to not doing it just yet, maybe again in the future.

437
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:38,567
But if push comes to shove and there is nobody else willing to step up and say the vice chair, I would be, I would entertain the notion.

438
00:31:40,256 --> 00:31:48,082
And I would also be willing to be vice chair, which has been also a kind of a tradition we've had too, is that chair steps down.

439
00:31:48,102 --> 00:31:48,723
You step down.

440
00:31:49,163 --> 00:31:51,285
Vice chair, yeah.

441
00:31:52,086 --> 00:31:55,568
There'll be more in keeping with the tradition, actually, to have you.

442
00:31:56,209 --> 00:31:57,530
Yeah.

443
00:31:57,650 --> 00:32:02,314
I know I had reached out to Leah about possibly being secretary, but you were not that interested.

444
00:32:02,334 --> 00:32:06,137
Noam, any interest?

445
00:32:08,738 --> 00:32:09,779
I'm not quite there yet.

446
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:17,605
I think I need to spend more time as a lay member before stepping out, but mark me interested for the future.

447
00:32:18,426 --> 00:32:18,726
Okay.

448
00:32:19,066 --> 00:32:20,748
Bruce, you haven't been secretary yet?

449
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:23,630
I am not a good secretary.

450
00:32:24,871 --> 00:32:31,116
I self-admit that I get too distracted and wound up in meetings to keep good notes.

451
00:32:32,177 --> 00:32:32,918
It doesn't work.

452
00:32:34,199 --> 00:32:37,021
So I'm going to say no, I won't do that.

453
00:32:38,772 --> 00:32:39,858
Leah, you don't want to do it?

454
00:32:40,621 --> 00:32:41,144
Secretary?

455
00:32:42,077 --> 00:32:49,603
Yeah, given that I constantly have trouble finding emails and the drive, I feel the same way as Bruce.

456
00:32:49,763 --> 00:32:51,285
I'm a very bad note taker.

457
00:32:51,385 --> 00:32:55,028
I'm Googling stuff and sending emails during this meeting.

458
00:32:55,048 --> 00:32:57,510
You all never read my notes.

459
00:32:57,590 --> 00:32:58,090
Not for me.

460
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:00,693
They're not good.

461
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:02,014
It's fine.

462
00:33:02,134 --> 00:33:08,439
I mean, honestly, I can show you what you need to do the meeting announcement every month.

463
00:33:08,539 --> 00:33:09,260
It's not a big deal.

464
00:33:10,074 --> 00:33:14,658
We could also... If you're saying hard no, that's okay too.

465
00:33:14,778 --> 00:33:17,841
I think that the note-taking is important.

466
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:24,407
The note-taking is also, frankly, something that is the easiest to outsource to an AI entity now.

467
00:33:24,767 --> 00:33:28,611
That is the single thing that they are absolutely best at, quite frankly.

468
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:28,691
And

469
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:33,804
Well, no, those are those are free.

470
00:33:33,925 --> 00:33:34,505
Those are free.

471
00:33:34,625 --> 00:33:55,425
All you need is the all you need is if we can get a transcript or a recording of this, we can get AI summarize notes, which would certainly be something that a secretary could do, but would lighten the lift of what the secretary has to do, such that the main thing the secretary really needs to do is just feed that into an AI tool, and then be the person who uploads the agenda and whatnot on a

472
00:33:55,790 --> 00:34:02,113
I guess the other- And the other- It's work as someone who's a little skeptical sometimes of the AI.

473
00:34:02,133 --> 00:34:07,375
A person who's skeptical of AI is the absolute best person to employ it.

474
00:34:07,435 --> 00:34:08,075
Oh, no, no, no.

475
00:34:08,095 --> 00:34:08,536
Quite frankly.

476
00:34:08,956 --> 00:34:10,156
Here's another suggestion.

477
00:34:10,656 --> 00:34:13,017
So the secretary really does two things.

478
00:34:13,378 --> 00:34:18,240
One is put together the agenda and announce the meeting.

479
00:34:19,578 --> 00:34:22,158
And the other is take the notes at the meeting.

480
00:34:22,899 --> 00:34:31,160
And if you can just make sure that the meeting announcement gets out on time, and then you make sure that somebody else is taking the notes, that's also good enough.

481
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,841
We just have to make sure that those things get done.

482
00:34:34,221 --> 00:34:39,162
We could, in theory, split those two as well and have a position of reporter, if you will.

483
00:34:39,782 --> 00:34:42,422
Yeah, we could totally have two jobs.

484
00:34:43,642 --> 00:34:46,403
Who are the three people who are members who aren't here?

485
00:34:46,723 --> 00:34:47,343
Sorry, Daniel.

486
00:34:48,843 --> 00:34:51,605
Who are the three people, or any of them?

487
00:34:51,885 --> 00:34:54,947
Mary Kate, Becca, and Doug.

488
00:34:56,949 --> 00:35:01,392
I bet Mary Kate would be good for one of those, for some of that.

489
00:35:03,253 --> 00:35:07,516
She's also the safe routes to schools person at the Brooks School.

490
00:35:07,536 --> 00:35:15,761
I don't know to what extent that takes up her non-MBAC time for bike things, probably worth checking on.

491
00:35:16,624 --> 00:35:19,047
Well, I wonder if we need to table the quest.

492
00:35:19,087 --> 00:35:24,152
Well, I wonder if we can table this secretary.

493
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:28,074
and leave the secretary vacant.

494
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:38,079
If Daniel wants to take over as chair and we can vote him in, then I will promise to send the agenda out for next meeting and try to be there and take the notes.

495
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:46,303
We just have to make sure that that gets done and we'll have to add getting a secretary ironed out to the next agenda.

496
00:35:47,884 --> 00:35:54,207
If we're- I move that we postpone the selection of secretary until the January meeting.

497
00:35:55,757 --> 00:36:10,457
Okay, we could also see about getting new members and then because, like, I, I, I started in the secretary role, like, my 1st or 2nd meeting on the commission.

498
00:36:11,607 --> 00:36:13,449
Um, who is it?

499
00:36:13,469 --> 00:36:17,472
Uh, Emily Duraco was the secretary before me.

500
00:36:17,553 --> 00:36:19,014
Lisa Duraco, yeah.

501
00:36:19,074 --> 00:36:19,935
Lisa Duraco.

502
00:36:20,315 --> 00:36:26,881
And then she wanted to step down and I just, I mean, like, right, I just was like, fine, I'll wing it.

503
00:36:27,581 --> 00:36:30,304
Um, so we might get more bites.

504
00:36:30,324 --> 00:36:30,964
That's a good point.

505
00:36:32,204 --> 00:36:33,606
Okay, so let's do that.

506
00:36:33,726 --> 00:36:42,955
We'll get our new members on board and then we'll postpone the secretary discussion to next meeting.

507
00:36:44,297 --> 00:36:46,519
Did we have a second for postponing that?

508
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:48,961
I think we did.

509
00:36:50,103 --> 00:36:50,683
All in favor?

510
00:36:50,703 --> 00:36:51,504
Aye.

511
00:36:53,382 --> 00:36:53,902
Okay, great.

512
00:36:53,962 --> 00:36:57,384
We will postpone the secretary selection until next meeting.

513
00:36:57,604 --> 00:36:58,244
Point of order?

514
00:36:58,924 --> 00:36:59,204
Yeah.

515
00:36:59,384 --> 00:37:04,446
I just, this is something that has been, I guess the word bugging me is the right thing.

516
00:37:05,407 --> 00:37:14,650
According to Robert's rules of order, the correct procedure is to request ayes and then separately request nays as a voice vote.

517
00:37:15,250 --> 00:37:20,493
And although pro forma, there's also the option for somebody to object to the vote.

518
00:37:20,513 --> 00:37:21,133
So it's sort of,

519
00:37:21,913 --> 00:37:33,882
You know, there's always that if you don't quite follow the rules and no one has so I'm not saying that that's a big deal, but I just wanted to point that out as a, as a. A walk of robbers rules of order.

520
00:37:34,203 --> 00:37:34,463
Okay.

521
00:37:35,284 --> 00:37:36,064
Yeah, I know that.

522
00:37:36,625 --> 00:37:41,669
I think I was aware that that was technically a thing, but as long as I can see everybody's faces on the screen.

523
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:47,973
I was going to act as secretary pro tem for the next two meetings, let's say.

524
00:37:48,373 --> 00:37:56,138
I'm a little leery of having a pure newcomer be the secretary until at least we've established that they can speak in full sentences.

525
00:37:57,479 --> 00:37:59,401
We'll probably be able to figure that out pretty quickly.

526
00:37:59,421 --> 00:38:00,281
Okay.

527
00:38:00,701 --> 00:38:01,122
My guess.

528
00:38:02,343 --> 00:38:05,565
So is it Jared or Emily who wants to be co-chair?

529
00:38:08,151 --> 00:38:13,754
Well, I think Jared sounded like he was happy to step back from that.

530
00:38:14,715 --> 00:38:18,997
And the tradition is that the chair goes down to co-chair or vice chair, rather.

531
00:38:19,598 --> 00:38:20,558
Co-chair would be different.

532
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,521
And if Daniel is willing to be chair.

533
00:38:25,682 --> 00:38:26,502
Is that the slate?

534
00:38:26,562 --> 00:38:27,663
Is that the nomination?

535
00:38:27,683 --> 00:38:31,785
I nominate Daniel to be chair and Emily to be vice chair.

536
00:38:33,807 --> 00:38:34,607
Now we have a slate.

537
00:38:35,588 --> 00:38:35,828
Great.

538
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:41,002
Do we need to second that or can we go straight to a vote?

539
00:38:42,063 --> 00:38:43,464
Just in case, I'll second that.

540
00:38:45,626 --> 00:38:46,306
Any discussion?

541
00:38:48,327 --> 00:38:49,928
Any points to be made by the candidates?

542
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:53,251
I think we've made them.

543
00:38:54,431 --> 00:38:54,992
Call the vote.

544
00:38:55,212 --> 00:38:56,913
All in favor of that slate?

545
00:38:57,013 --> 00:38:57,193
Aye.

546
00:38:57,514 --> 00:38:58,234
All opposed?

547
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:09,701
And we have one abstention because Jared has to step away for kiddo duty.

548
00:39:10,501 --> 00:39:13,303
So, uh, this slate passes.

549
00:39:15,925 --> 00:39:17,345
Daniel, would you like to take it from here?

550
00:39:19,226 --> 00:39:20,267
And I'll get back to you.

551
00:39:20,287 --> 00:39:20,727
I'll get back to you.

552
00:39:20,747 --> 00:39:21,148
I'll get back to you.

553
00:39:21,168 --> 00:39:21,848
I'll get back to you.

554
00:39:21,868 --> 00:39:22,308
I'll get back to you.

555
00:39:22,328 --> 00:39:22,809
I'll get back to you.

556
00:39:22,829 --> 00:39:23,249
I'll get back to you.

557
00:39:23,269 --> 00:39:23,749
I'll get back to you.

558
00:39:23,769 --> 00:39:24,189
I'll get back to you.

559
00:39:24,209 --> 00:39:24,610
I'll get back to you.

560
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:25,050
I'll get back to you.

561
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:25,490
I'll get back to you.

562
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:25,950
I'll get back to you.

563
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:26,391
I'll get back to you.

564
00:39:26,411 --> 00:39:26,811
I'll get back to you.

565
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:27,331
I'll get back to you.

566
00:39:27,351 --> 00:39:27,771
I'll get back to you.

567
00:39:27,791 --> 00:39:28,532
I'll get back to you.

568
00:39:28,552 --> 00:39:29,212
I'll get back to you.

569
00:39:29,252 --> 00:39:29,813
I'll get back to you.

570
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:30,313
I'll get back to you.

571
00:39:30,333 --> 00:39:30,993
I'll get back to you.

572
00:39:31,013 --> 00:39:31,634
I'll get back to you.

573
00:39:31,674 --> 00:39:32,154
I'll get back to you.

574
00:39:32,254 --> 00:39:32,994
I'll get back to you.

575
00:39:33,034 --> 00:39:33,635
I'll get back to you.

576
00:39:33,655 --> 00:39:34,015
I'll get back to

577
00:39:34,295 --> 00:39:36,657
I can sense he needs a bathroom break.

578
00:39:36,697 --> 00:39:37,638
Give him a minute, will you?

579
00:39:38,618 --> 00:39:41,781
I mean, I just make one of them is anywhere.

580
00:39:41,821 --> 00:39:44,883
It's like all of a sudden it's like, Daniel, can you take over right at the meeting?

581
00:39:44,963 --> 00:39:46,384
I'm like, I'm still taking the notes.

582
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:47,164
I'm still taking the notes.

583
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:47,585
No, no, no, no, no.

584
00:39:47,605 --> 00:39:48,425
Don't worry about it.

585
00:39:48,445 --> 00:39:48,806
I forgot.

586
00:39:48,946 --> 00:39:55,370
I make a motion to suspend the rules and appoint Emily as chair of Pro Tem for the remainder of this meeting.

587
00:39:56,892 --> 00:39:57,352
Seconded.

588
00:39:58,393 --> 00:39:58,733
All right.

589
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,755
I guess I better say all in favor then.

590
00:40:03,775 --> 00:40:04,575
Aye.

591
00:40:04,595 --> 00:40:05,796
Aye.

592
00:40:06,536 --> 00:40:09,679
Although if I am not yet chair pro tem, I don't know if I can do that.

593
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:13,261
Let's move on.

594
00:40:13,301 --> 00:40:14,102
We've got that sorted out.

595
00:40:14,142 --> 00:40:14,982
Next up is the

596
00:40:23,425 --> 00:40:30,489
The route 16 Auburn Street walkthrough recap Ellery and I put this together.

597
00:40:30,569 --> 00:40:31,789
Ellery really put this together.

598
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:35,451
We had been talking about this spot.

599
00:40:35,511 --> 00:40:38,393
This is the spot with the guardrail to get smashed into all the time.

600
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:54,865
That we've kind of chosen to fixate on a little bit just because it's an example of a place where DCR can't possibly know that it's a problem because they have to keep repairing the guardrail and somebody writes the checks for that.

601
00:40:54,885 --> 00:40:54,925
So.

602
00:40:57,981 --> 00:41:00,363
Ellery put up a write-up.

603
00:41:01,624 --> 00:41:21,321
In attendance were me and Daniel and also Todd Blake, Carl Alexander from MIRA, Senator Jalen's chief of staff was there, Councilor Lazaro was there, Ellery Klein was there, and Sarah Reinfeldt from WAC Medford.

604
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:28,838
and Medford CPA Administrator Roberta Cameron, and a number of other Medford residents.

605
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:35,452
The observations, none of this is going to come as a drastic shock to anybody.

606
00:41:36,593 --> 00:41:38,935
Auburn Street Bridge bike ped path.

607
00:41:39,496 --> 00:41:44,380
The guardrail is repeatedly crashed into and replaced, demonstrating a lack of safety and traffic calming.

608
00:41:45,441 --> 00:41:46,662
Traffic calming is needed.

609
00:41:47,062 --> 00:41:51,526
The guardrail is also clearly not sufficient against modern heavy vehicles.

610
00:41:52,747 --> 00:41:57,792
We have photos of that guardrail having been smashed into to the point where it

611
00:41:58,452 --> 00:42:12,162
was completely across the path, blocking the path and hanging over the edge of the bridge that's right there, which it wasn't in that state at this point, but we have seen it and have photos in that state.

612
00:42:14,704 --> 00:42:24,291
The path is a shared bike and pedestrian facility, but it's only five feet wide in places, and it's not really clear when it's a sidewalk and when it's a shared facility.

613
00:42:27,076 --> 00:42:33,319
One of the attendees actually expressed alarm that people would be allowed to ride bikes on that spot because it looks like a sidewalk.

614
00:42:34,220 --> 00:42:43,365
But there's no on-street alternative, and there's not a clear way that you would go between the bike path and the street if you were going to do it that way.

615
00:42:43,385 --> 00:42:49,009
And if you went into the street, then you would be on the street where the people smash into the guardrail all the time.

616
00:42:51,284 --> 00:42:55,367
The paths continue directly from Mystic River Path between Winthrop and Auburn.

617
00:42:56,428 --> 00:43:00,210
The facilities should be made appropriate for sharing, and it should be clear that that's what's going on.

618
00:43:02,151 --> 00:43:14,139
This is also a spot where two lanes diminish to one, and the point where it goes down to one lane is at the eastern side of Auburn Street.

619
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:25,122
And that's around the corner, so if you're heading east, you don't necessarily see where one lane reduces.

620
00:43:25,162 --> 00:43:27,583
I'd like to make a quick proposal with regard to that.

621
00:43:27,663 --> 00:43:33,304
I know there's also a Somerville-ish committee that's looking into traffic calming on Mystic Valley.

622
00:43:33,564 --> 00:43:33,865
Yeah.

623
00:43:33,985 --> 00:43:43,907
But it does seem like there's no reason for it to be four lanes in the section between Auburn Street and the Rotary at Zilboy Field.

624
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:53,414
It was brought up by Todd Blake, I believe, at that meeting that they were going to be producing lanes coming down towards Medford as well.

625
00:43:53,875 --> 00:44:05,043
Incidentally, if it was reduced to 2 lanes, that would provide sufficient room for bicycle lanes as well, and possibly a turning lane if they reconfigured that road.

626
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:11,809
I mean, for those who don't want to ride on the sidewalk slash shared use path, which doesn't exist in that area.

627
00:44:12,467 --> 00:44:19,813
Yeah, and I think that could also make enough room for a bump out where the guardrail is.

628
00:44:21,594 --> 00:44:29,240
Even changing it as two lanes would reduce it from being a super highway type road that some people seem to think it is.

629
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:41,289
Of course, if you've tanked up a few too many at some local tavern, which I suspect is maybe the cause of some of these crashes, maybe that won't make a difference.

630
00:44:42,322 --> 00:44:50,727
Yeah, I mean, I think it, I suspect it also is people late at night who like, you know, are essentially drag racing on it.

631
00:44:51,987 --> 00:44:57,970
Um, and I, I don't know that, but that's, that, that's a possibility.

632
00:44:58,030 --> 00:45:04,674
And the, you know, the fact that if you don't already know what's about to happen, that lane reduction happens with no warning right after a curve.

633
00:45:05,815 --> 00:45:05,895
Um,

634
00:45:06,847 --> 00:45:15,415
So there's a number of things I can actually pass along this document to anyone who's interested.

635
00:45:16,937 --> 00:45:20,640
There's also a lack of pedestrian crossing signals across Auburn Street.

636
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:25,485
You get a walk signal to cross Route 16, but not to cross Auburn Street at either crossing.

637
00:45:28,167 --> 00:45:37,257
It's a fairly long way between pedestrian crossings and the intersections where you can cross are not without their own problems.

638
00:45:38,438 --> 00:45:43,584
In addition, so there's a, there's kind of a long list.

639
00:45:44,405 --> 00:45:46,027
I guess I won't read the whole thing because it's.

640
00:45:47,365 --> 00:45:47,945
Five pages.

641
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:51,568
There's a number of recommendations here.

642
00:45:52,108 --> 00:45:58,293
The main thing is that this is a DCR road, and it's not a City of Medford road.

643
00:45:59,133 --> 00:46:04,237
But we're hoping to get some more attention from DCR to this spot.

644
00:46:04,257 --> 00:46:07,660
Do we know if the bridge is DCR or is that a mass thought?

645
00:46:09,461 --> 00:46:12,943
I have not heard anybody say that it isn't DCR.

646
00:46:13,264 --> 00:46:13,544
Okay.

647
00:46:15,068 --> 00:46:19,349
That doesn't mean it's the train bridge.

648
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:23,571
No, no, no, the bridge over the river often bridges are.

649
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:31,413
Different jurisdictions surprisingly, I haven't heard anything about it, but that doesn't mean it's not Leah.

650
00:46:33,387 --> 00:46:39,729
I probably should have asked this earlier or done a point of order or something, but could we have a visual for those of us who are not?

651
00:46:39,789 --> 00:46:42,550
Yes, I can do that.

652
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:43,671
That's rather silly of me.

653
00:46:43,691 --> 00:46:46,612
Someone with a functioning mouse, which is not me.

654
00:46:47,972 --> 00:46:49,793
Hang on just a second and I'll pull it up.

655
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:57,696
If I can see where we're looking, then I can check on the jurisdiction of the bridge.

656
00:46:58,576 --> 00:46:59,016
Oh, great.

657
00:46:59,936 --> 00:47:00,897
Oh, hang on a second.

658
00:47:02,985 --> 00:47:04,186
I've already got on my screen.

659
00:47:04,206 --> 00:47:07,748
If you want to just let me share, but that's where you're trying to figure out.

660
00:47:08,809 --> 00:47:09,430
No, I've got it.

661
00:47:13,613 --> 00:47:15,454
Uh, share, share, share.

662
00:47:22,579 --> 00:47:24,400
Ernie, you're muted if you're trying to say something.

663
00:47:27,363 --> 00:47:27,563
Hey.

664
00:47:28,383 --> 00:47:29,704
Yeah, I'm dilated.

665
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:30,525
So make it big.

666
00:47:31,777 --> 00:47:33,479
All right, I'll do my best.

667
00:47:34,139 --> 00:47:35,561
Where did the thingy go?

668
00:47:36,362 --> 00:47:36,982
Oh, there it is.

669
00:47:37,002 --> 00:47:40,366
Here we go.

670
00:47:40,706 --> 00:47:42,828
Sorry, I'm having Zoom difficulties.

671
00:47:42,848 --> 00:47:43,569
Can everybody see that?

672
00:47:45,251 --> 00:47:46,732
So this is the Whole Foods.

673
00:47:47,473 --> 00:47:50,376
This is the Mystic River Path.

674
00:47:52,658 --> 00:47:52,819
And

675
00:47:55,098 --> 00:48:00,583
This here where you can see this guardrail with a dent in it in the satellite photo.

676
00:48:00,643 --> 00:48:03,105
Would this also be the bridge we're asking about?

677
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:03,746
Yes.

678
00:48:04,046 --> 00:48:04,326
Yeah.

679
00:48:04,987 --> 00:48:05,247
Yeah.

680
00:48:09,331 --> 00:48:12,354
And where's the lane reduction you were just talking about?

681
00:48:13,530 --> 00:48:18,995
Here it's one lane in this direction, and right up until here it's two.

682
00:48:19,055 --> 00:48:28,623
If you're coming this way, you've got this slip lane here and it's still two lanes, and it's still two lanes here, and it's one lane here, but you don't know that.

683
00:48:29,844 --> 00:48:33,127
When the other lane is not for turning or anything.

684
00:48:33,147 --> 00:48:38,572
It's prohibited to make a left turn on Auburn Street at that point.

685
00:48:39,038 --> 00:48:41,020
Although people do it, and that's another problem.

686
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:44,162
We saw several people do it while we were standing right there.

687
00:48:44,182 --> 00:48:51,107
Conversely, it is not prohibited to make the left turn southbound onto Auburn Street.

688
00:48:53,129 --> 00:49:02,176
The left turn on Auburn is particularly interesting if it's as there's solar glare in the afternoon when you're coming from 16.

689
00:49:03,297 --> 00:49:07,060
So it's a very hazardous illegal turn onto Auburn.

690
00:49:08,103 --> 00:49:12,647
And so what happens if you're biking this direction on the path, you get here.

691
00:49:13,587 --> 00:49:23,295
And if you want to head, continue along the Mystic River paths, you're either going to get to over here, or you're going to get to over here and then go kind of in front of the U-Haul.

692
00:49:24,076 --> 00:49:27,118
And it's a kind of pick your poison situation.

693
00:49:27,859 --> 00:49:32,723
Would you rather have the bad sidewalk by the U-Haul or would you rather have to get over to here somehow?

694
00:49:33,828 --> 00:49:42,876
Which is a very awkward movement to get from the river, to get from the path to the west side is very awkward through those two intersections.

695
00:49:43,076 --> 00:49:43,456
Yeah.

696
00:49:43,496 --> 00:49:59,229
You can either do it this way, in which case, this is actually where one of the resident attendees was dismayed that anybody would actually be biking on the sidewalk in this little corner, which of course, if you were going to take this crosswalk and then take this crosswalk,

697
00:50:00,159 --> 00:50:08,885
that's what you do, or you just, you know, more often you cut, a lot of people cut through that, but that's not, that's not like legal or sanctioned.

698
00:50:09,786 --> 00:50:11,887
This crossing doesn't have a walk sign at all.

699
00:50:12,488 --> 00:50:18,191
There's nothing to tell you when it's, when you have a safe phase to cross and you just have to kind of guess.

700
00:50:19,855 --> 00:50:27,882
And cars can be coming from over here and they're kind of, it's a long intersection so they're far away and you can't necessarily see this light if you're standing over here.

701
00:50:29,644 --> 00:50:33,808
And the same here with this crossing at Auburn street, there's no walk signal here either.

702
00:50:33,828 --> 00:50:35,769
And then there's.

703
00:50:37,832 --> 00:50:38,793
can I zoom in more than this?

704
00:50:39,493 --> 00:50:43,374
Yeah, there's this island here and this one and this one.

705
00:50:44,595 --> 00:50:50,297
If you want to get across this way, this is also a very awkward movement to do on bike.

706
00:50:51,137 --> 00:50:53,578
This is another awkward movement to do on bike.

707
00:50:53,618 --> 00:50:57,880
You don't get a walk signal or any kind of guide of when you can cross here.

708
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:00,561
This slip lane has no nothing.

709
00:51:02,301 --> 00:51:03,222
And that's definitely.

710
00:51:04,802 --> 00:51:08,724
you know, trying to get across here is kind of a fraught thing to do too.

711
00:51:09,645 --> 00:51:15,808
So you're kind of left to guess and make it up as you go around along and hope for the best.

712
00:51:18,849 --> 00:51:23,912
The entire intersection and bridge are owned by DCR.

713
00:51:25,493 --> 00:51:25,613
Okay.

714
00:51:26,525 --> 00:51:27,966
Good.

715
00:51:28,727 --> 00:51:47,564
And so, in particular, in light of the fatality on Mem drive in a spot where a car went careening off of the street over the curb onto this onto the side path in a spot where people had been telling that this is this is speed and this is.

716
00:51:48,505 --> 00:51:50,407
a problem for a long time.

717
00:51:50,427 --> 00:52:02,376
We were hoping to get some attention to this spot and hopefully others like it by saying, well, you also clearly know that this is a problem because you have to keep replacing the guardrail.

718
00:52:03,717 --> 00:52:07,460
And we would like it to get dealt with before somebody actually dies there.

719
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,642
So we had

720
00:52:13,762 --> 00:52:24,356
We had somebody from Senator Jalen's office, and Todd Blake is on board.

721
00:52:24,376 --> 00:52:27,580
The next step is that we will

722
00:52:29,242 --> 00:52:44,208
those of us who are there, we'll look at, look over this document of kind of suggestions and things that were discussed at that meeting and hope that we can get some attention from DCR.

723
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:52,811
I think the mayor's office and the city council will be happy to back us on putting this, you know, getting attention to this.

724
00:52:55,792 --> 00:53:01,715
And hopefully that will get some movement here.

725
00:53:02,336 --> 00:53:16,062
There certainly are bigger, longer-term changes that could be made involving ways to build bike lanes or cycle tracks or wider side paths or wider sidewalks, et cetera, et cetera, if a lane is removed.

726
00:53:16,982 --> 00:53:22,245
But there are also shorter-term things that could happen

727
00:53:23,546 --> 00:53:43,711
much more quickly and much more cheaply, and even though DCR may not like to do kind of the cheap temporary stuff, this seems like a case where the conditions really weren't doing as much as possible as soon as possible, even if it requires a bigger project later.

728
00:53:43,731 --> 00:53:45,912
Ernie?

729
00:53:46,692 --> 00:53:47,352
Yeah.

730
00:53:47,632 --> 00:53:50,993
Are one of the recommendations that eastbound traffic

731
00:53:52,921 --> 00:54:01,404
after the light include sharrows in the right-bound lane or even the reduction to two lanes there?

732
00:54:01,424 --> 00:54:07,486
Well, from one lane, from two lanes in the eastbound direction, or a bike lane?

733
00:54:07,906 --> 00:54:10,247
I'm actually afraid that because

734
00:54:11,768 --> 00:54:23,564
people who zip through that light when they finally get a green one have an obstructed view because of that S-curve, and they've been banging into that guardrail repeatedly.

735
00:54:24,145 --> 00:54:28,230
Now, I substitute the guardrail as a whole bunch of us bicyclists.

736
00:54:30,351 --> 00:54:44,414
What we do temporarily to make it inviting to us, I think we're at great risk if we put ourselves in the space of a known hazard intersection.

737
00:54:44,474 --> 00:54:47,055
I don't think we're suggesting that.

738
00:54:47,175 --> 00:54:58,217
One of the things, at least not right now, one of the suggestions is to make it go down to one lane east of this whole intersection because it's

739
00:54:59,542 --> 00:55:02,403
Yeah, sorry, west of this whole intersection.

740
00:55:02,463 --> 00:55:08,904
It's already one lane east of the intersection to make it go down to one lane west of that.

741
00:55:08,984 --> 00:55:17,366
So they're not trying to funnel in to one lane at the last possible minute when they didn't even see it before, right as they get to the intersection.

742
00:55:17,426 --> 00:55:18,427
That would be important.

743
00:55:19,247 --> 00:55:25,868
Yeah, then we're going to get a lot of trouble for people who want to make the right turn to go to Whole Foods.

744
00:55:26,429 --> 00:55:27,829
Is that what that risk is about?

745
00:55:29,665 --> 00:55:34,448
No, well, you can still have a right turn lane, but that doesn't mean that it has to be one.

746
00:55:34,609 --> 00:55:36,970
It doesn't, that still mean, and there's a slip lane there.

747
00:55:37,390 --> 00:55:40,353
So that still doesn't mean there's two lanes entering that intersection.

748
00:55:40,733 --> 00:55:41,073
Okay.

749
00:55:41,974 --> 00:55:45,276
Then that would work.

750
00:55:45,396 --> 00:55:45,876
Yeah.

751
00:55:47,397 --> 00:55:53,602
And that was one of the things that Todd had mentioned and that Todd has, um, has mentioned to them before.

752
00:55:53,622 --> 00:55:53,722
Um, so.

753
00:55:56,970 --> 00:56:13,018
So that's, so yes, and if that was done, then there would be more room, then there could even be like temporary barriers or plastic barrels or something in that space where it's two lanes in the middle of the intersection, because at that point it would have already gone down to one.

754
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:20,102
And now the part adjacent to the guardrail, you could put like more visible barriers or barrels or something.

755
00:56:21,803 --> 00:56:24,444
Leah?

756
00:56:24,504 --> 00:56:25,545
This is just another.

757
00:56:26,529 --> 00:56:38,198
Like, a little bit of information that I found while I was looking for stuff about this intersection that I did want to point out, which is that it is not a crash cluster.

758
00:56:39,259 --> 00:56:44,483
Yet, but, you know, it's just something interesting to think about.

759
00:56:44,503 --> 00:56:49,627
It doesn't mean that we shouldn't do anything here, but it is not.

760
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:58,043
You know, statistically and crash related only, it is not the most dangerous intersection in Medford.

761
00:56:58,704 --> 00:57:03,173
We have a top 200 right quite nearby and some other crash clusters as well.

762
00:57:04,191 --> 00:57:27,301
Would you actually would you do me a favor Leah that would if you if you get a chance, would you make a list of or share with the share with the group and you could just send it to the email list that we can add it to the agenda later for later meeting, but it would actually be really useful to know where those are and and see if there are things that we can that we should be talking about with those.

763
00:57:28,642 --> 00:57:37,332
And my question, there's a crash cluster all out the differences between pedestrian cyclist and motor vehicle to motor vehicle crashes.

764
00:57:39,014 --> 00:57:41,737
Sort of a aggregate of, oh, this is.

765
00:57:41,757 --> 00:57:45,802
You know, checks a number of boxes, so we call it a crash cluster.

766
00:57:46,506 --> 00:57:49,407
There are different kinds there.

767
00:57:50,647 --> 00:57:57,370
There's kind of the overall top 200, which is which that like kind of.

768
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:12,514
You get higher in the top, you know, intersection crashes the top 200 crash locations in the state by having more fatal and serious injury crashes, and those include motor vehicle, pedestrian, cyclists, you know anyone.

769
00:58:14,235 --> 00:58:20,958
And then there are specific pedestrian and cyclist crash clusters.

770
00:58:22,238 --> 00:58:29,081
Um, that are about specifically the, you know, those kinds of crashes, but that does not mean that.

771
00:58:30,061 --> 00:58:33,463
Other kinds of top crash clusters don't have those crashes.

772
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:43,864
Um, that's helpful if I can ask you 1 other question about that, actually, because this is something that I've wondered about with this specific spot.

773
00:58:43,884 --> 00:58:46,705
2 is, you know, I don't go there.

774
00:58:47,025 --> 00:58:51,027
I don't go through there every day, but I go through there fairly often and.

775
00:58:51,707 --> 00:58:58,690
You basically, every time you go through the guardrail is a slightly different shape and when you see it at its worst.

776
00:58:59,590 --> 00:59:04,795
it's smashed up all over the place and you think, wow, that must have been a crazy big crash.

777
00:59:05,616 --> 00:59:16,626
But if you see it every day or every week, it actually looks more like people hit it, not necessarily that catastrophically, they just hit it a lot.

778
00:59:17,307 --> 00:59:19,969
And I suspect that at least some of those people

779
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:26,566
are in are still able to drive away after having hit it.

780
00:59:26,706 --> 00:59:30,608
Just not as like cataclysmically hard.

781
00:59:30,628 --> 00:59:36,491
Yeah, there's there's the caveat is that crash data is reported, right?

782
00:59:37,411 --> 00:59:44,394
And I often reasons that I would say, you know, just because it isn't a top crash location doesn't mean we should do anything there.

783
00:59:44,454 --> 00:59:48,376
Because aside from not reporting things like near misses sometimes.

784
00:59:49,436 --> 00:59:52,898
Crashes are not reported to the police.

785
00:59:53,078 --> 00:59:56,859
If they were reported, they would be called like property damage only.

786
00:59:56,879 --> 01:00:02,421
Yeah, I was wondering how so that was going to be my next question is how does that factor in?

787
01:00:04,522 --> 01:00:17,668
Yeah, definitely not not thought of as as bad as something that caused interesting to see how many times the guardrail has had to be replaced when there has not been an accident at the site.

788
01:00:19,605 --> 01:00:26,808
I can believe that most of the crashes into that guardrail are the result of late night shenanigans.

789
01:00:27,508 --> 01:00:41,374
Maybe I'm just being speculative here, but the person would, as Emily pointed out, still be able to drive the car away and not want to have the police involved.

790
01:00:42,094 --> 01:00:47,517
I get the sense from other people who live closer to that spot than I do that that might be the case.

791
01:00:48,317 --> 01:01:02,227
but the other part that concerns us too is that this area of the path almost always has a sharp piece of metal from the side of the guardrail sticking out into it.

792
01:01:02,327 --> 01:01:13,614
I have almost run into that on foot myself because there was somebody on a bike coming the other way who surprised me around this corner and I jump out of the way and almost hit this.

793
01:01:13,634 --> 01:01:16,636
There's no protection on the sidewalk side of that guardrail.

794
01:01:17,777 --> 01:01:21,342
At least on the Eastern side of the bridge, I don't know about the Western side because I never use it.

795
01:01:21,362 --> 01:01:31,475
But on the Eastern side, the guardrail posts are basically I-beams that are about 4 inches thick and have sharp edges.

796
01:01:31,495 --> 01:01:34,179
So if you run into those I-beams, it's not comfortable.

797
01:01:34,785 --> 01:01:42,890
Yeah, and they and when there's and they're almost always yeah, they're almost always sticking out into the path until the guardrail gets fixed.

798
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:45,251
And then they're where they should be for a little while.

799
01:01:45,271 --> 01:01:49,454
I think that guardrail has been replaced at least 4 times this year.

800
01:01:49,474 --> 01:01:49,574
Maybe 5.

801
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:56,350
Um, and if nothing else, that costs money.

802
01:01:57,331 --> 01:02:04,497
Um, but that, that area of path is just constantly littered with, like, broken up car parts.

803
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:08,460
It's a, you know, it's, like, it's not, it's not pretty.

804
01:02:08,540 --> 01:02:09,241
It's not nice.

805
01:02:09,281 --> 01:02:13,604
You don't feel good stopping to look over the edge into the river there.

806
01:02:14,385 --> 01:02:16,046
Noam, I see, I've seen your hand up for a while.

807
01:02:17,027 --> 01:02:17,387
Oh, yeah.

808
01:02:17,448 --> 01:02:19,649
So, um, I live around there and I go by all the time.

809
01:02:22,575 --> 01:02:37,661
And I've noticed like, again, these are my observations, but when it's like bumper to bumper traffic, you get these aggressive incursions where people are racing to get to the lone spot where it goes down to one lane.

810
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:40,523
No, in our grail.

811
01:02:43,184 --> 01:02:48,086
Just kind of like, so I feel like if there's an architecture that's worth like,

812
01:02:49,391 --> 01:02:57,699
Advocating for is something really similar to what's going on down at powder house because that's like a transformation, you know, where now there is it's controlled.

813
01:02:57,819 --> 01:02:59,200
Like, there's very little speeding.

814
01:03:01,122 --> 01:03:03,525
Traffic gets through efficient efficiently and that.

815
01:03:04,385 --> 01:03:07,388
The intersection here seems in fact, it's almost too narrow.

816
01:03:08,129 --> 01:03:10,631
In my opinion, that powder house, but I know what you mean.

817
01:03:10,691 --> 01:03:11,993
It works well for traffic control.

818
01:03:12,997 --> 01:03:15,421
Yeah, it definitely slows you down if you're going too fast.

819
01:03:15,441 --> 01:03:19,989
So I feel like that that's one, whether it's in intended or unintended.

820
01:03:21,552 --> 01:03:21,813
Ernie.

821
01:03:21,833 --> 01:03:24,497
Yeah, no one took the words out of my.

822
01:03:25,537 --> 01:03:46,470
but we had just said that the eastbound traffic there, where it says Mr. Valley Parkway, will be down to one lane, so there won't be that competition in the middle of the bridge for who gets to go first, which I postulate results in a lot of people swerving to the right and hitting the guardrail.

823
01:03:47,810 --> 01:03:51,333
Nonetheless, if that still can somehow occur,

824
01:03:52,807 --> 01:03:59,571
The guardrail is no longer an unreported accident to the police and therefore not a crash cluster.

825
01:04:00,532 --> 01:04:05,615
But it's one of us getting killed where it immediately becomes a bright crash.

826
01:04:06,555 --> 01:04:13,279
So I'm just a little worried about balancing these two somewhat opposing

827
01:04:16,295 --> 01:04:18,316
characteristics of this intersection.

828
01:04:18,736 --> 01:04:30,922
I think the important thing to say here is the reason we were talking about this spot in particular is that we have seen that guardrail get replaced so many times.

829
01:04:32,483 --> 01:04:38,926
They can't possibly say there's no problem because they've been writing the checks to replace the guardrail.

830
01:04:39,586 --> 01:04:51,084
Yeah, and even a dented fender or bumper is a thousand dollar incursion, but a lot of people have that if they don't have collision on their own and they've caused the accident, which.

831
01:04:52,739 --> 01:04:57,944
there are no other vehicles involved, it's their own property, it's onerous to make a claim.

832
01:04:58,705 --> 01:05:10,676
So I think there are, I would say most of those incursions with that guardrail are probably not ever reported, because there's no insurance claim, therefore no police report.

833
01:05:12,118 --> 01:05:14,220
Because those are prerequisites for each other.

834
01:05:15,695 --> 01:05:18,836
Yeah, I mean, I think that may be true.

835
01:05:20,297 --> 01:05:30,161
And more than just that guardrail, there are a lot of things that make it just feel like a very fraught place to get across, either on bike or on foot.

836
01:05:30,721 --> 01:05:40,345
And especially given that we've been talking about the connection that the clipper ship makes with this whole corridor, and this is part of that corridor too.

837
01:05:42,326 --> 01:05:52,850
We need the attention to this spot and we need the attention from DCR more broadly to all these connections that have to be made between all of these pathways.

838
01:05:54,090 --> 01:05:57,511
If you want to use this corridor, you have to get across all of these intersections.

839
01:05:57,531 --> 01:06:01,833
Does Todd state that the reduction to one lane for their

840
01:06:03,202 --> 01:06:06,043
west coming east is already in the works?

841
01:06:06,824 --> 01:06:12,827
Because I see that as a prerequisite to anything that could involve having bicycles on that intersection.

842
01:06:13,587 --> 01:06:21,091
Well, I mean, his suggestion is what, like, you could fairly easily change it to one lane somewhere down in here.

843
01:06:21,111 --> 01:06:28,235
You know, you've got this kind of, if you did it somewhere down in here, that doesn't really have to change anything else.

844
01:06:29,075 --> 01:06:31,617
And even if that change farther east comes later,

845
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:41,811
then if you do it here where it's a straightaway and everybody can see what's going on, and then it's already happened by the time you get to the intersection, that changes really very little.

846
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:49,501
I think the people at whole Amazon or Whole Foods would be so grateful for that, that they would put up bike racks.

847
01:06:51,303 --> 01:06:52,964
There are bike racks at Whole Foods.

848
01:06:53,545 --> 01:06:54,045
Oh, all right.

849
01:06:54,165 --> 01:06:54,425
OK.

850
01:06:54,645 --> 01:06:56,887
Yeah, they do have actually decent bike racks.

851
01:06:57,628 --> 01:06:59,529
One of them is broken, but they do have them.

852
01:07:00,310 --> 01:07:00,430
OK.

853
01:07:00,650 --> 01:07:11,278
Anyway, that was really kind of an update on what that is and where that is and why that spot.

854
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:17,262
And hopefully, we'll get some more movement on that.

855
01:07:22,993 --> 01:07:24,654
Sorry, I think I muted myself.

856
01:07:24,674 --> 01:07:36,664
Leah, if you have that information that you can share on the top 200 crash sites nearby, or at least in the city of Medford, that would be awesome.

857
01:07:37,324 --> 01:07:39,226
I put the whole map in the chat.

858
01:07:39,506 --> 01:07:40,266
Oh, great.

859
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:45,751
I've got a broken mouse, so I have no ability to scroll.

860
01:07:47,612 --> 01:07:51,693
Oh, and I also can't share, but I could share the map real quick for Medford.

861
01:07:51,733 --> 01:07:53,353
There's only four locations.

862
01:07:56,754 --> 01:07:59,075
But I'm not allowed to share.

863
01:07:59,095 --> 01:08:00,295
You should be able to now.

864
01:08:00,315 --> 01:08:06,196
There we go.

865
01:08:07,076 --> 01:08:11,257
You see in my screen, oh God, this is making it even worse.

866
01:08:12,278 --> 01:08:13,418
I have one of them clicked on.

867
01:08:14,452 --> 01:08:15,233
That's not what I want.

868
01:08:15,333 --> 01:08:15,693
All right.

869
01:08:16,033 --> 01:08:18,955
Um, yeah, so in Medford, we've got.

870
01:08:18,975 --> 01:08:21,377
These 4 there's this.

871
01:08:22,257 --> 01:08:25,459
The blue is pedestrian clusters.

872
01:08:26,820 --> 01:08:28,481
So there's this guy.

873
01:08:28,501 --> 01:08:32,504
Place dead and route 60 ish.

874
01:08:33,945 --> 01:08:39,449
Uh, there's this guy, which is a pedestrian crash cluster and I believe a top.

875
01:08:40,149 --> 01:08:40,769
Yep, top 200.

876
01:08:43,071 --> 01:08:47,853
Um, by the way, they sort of cycle these out every.

877
01:08:48,873 --> 01:08:53,234
Year or 2 with new data, so these are the years that are closed, which means all the.

878
01:08:54,074 --> 01:08:57,335
Data is like all set, um.

879
01:08:58,796 --> 01:09:03,517
And we've got this 1 on Salem street.

880
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:08,659
Really there that's pedestrian cluster.

881
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:11,620
And finally.

882
01:09:13,120 --> 01:09:23,928
good old Wellington Circle, pedestrian, top 200, and whatever orange is, top 5%.

883
01:09:24,269 --> 01:09:27,791
And right in front of the police station, no less.

884
01:09:28,272 --> 01:09:30,093
Right in front of the police station, indeed.

885
01:09:30,113 --> 01:09:39,080
Yes, the one in West Medford, pedestrians or vehicles, you know, making that left turn onto Harvard, stuff like that.

886
01:09:40,545 --> 01:09:40,985
This one.

887
01:09:41,505 --> 01:09:44,867
Or buses crashing into each other, trying to get by trucks.

888
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:46,748
This one's a pedestrian cluster.

889
01:09:46,948 --> 01:09:52,850
People trying to cross in front of the tracks, and there's no good way to cross in that area.

890
01:09:53,931 --> 01:10:03,735
Yeah, and this one's massively driven up by the fact that there have been two fatal or serious injury crashes here in the last, you know, 10-ish years.

891
01:10:04,415 --> 01:10:04,615
Yeah.

892
01:10:07,887 --> 01:10:28,097
fatal and serious injury crashes are weighted super highly over property damage only, because when you're talking, it's really horrendous, the sort of distinctions you have to make to decide where are the most dangerous places in the entire state, but that's kind of how they have to do it.

893
01:10:29,877 --> 01:10:38,939
Is there a correlated list of projects, or do these sites get actioned by the state based on the data?

894
01:10:39,079 --> 01:10:48,822
Because the one you just highlighted, yeah, it's pretty terrible to cross, and there's a lot of left-hook action from high street to placehood.

895
01:10:49,696 --> 01:11:02,788
Well, that Medford Square MassDOT project that we've discussed, that is one of those spots, and they did mention that in their information about that project.

896
01:11:04,369 --> 01:11:09,594
Top 200s are frequently acted upon.

897
01:11:15,375 --> 01:11:18,176
There is no correlated list of projects.

898
01:11:18,236 --> 01:11:23,177
You have to dig through the capital improvement plan of the state.

899
01:11:24,298 --> 01:11:27,078
The intersection and safety programs will have them.

900
01:11:27,819 --> 01:11:37,341
Looking at this, I think I'm looking at, it looks like Salem Street and then Felsway West are two separate ones.

901
01:11:41,317 --> 01:11:46,842
Oh, you've been a victim of my lack of mouse control.

902
01:11:46,922 --> 01:11:47,643
I'm sorry.

903
01:11:47,863 --> 01:11:48,544
Well, you don't see that.

904
01:11:48,604 --> 01:11:51,006
I mean, it looks like that, but only when you scroll in enough.

905
01:11:52,648 --> 01:12:03,317
But I'm wondering if, and Salem Street is Route 60 there, but I'm wondering if some of those are things that might be

906
01:12:04,718 --> 01:12:14,770
more fruitful in that the city of Medford might have more ability to affect it independently of the state and therefore be able to do things a little sooner.

907
01:12:19,877 --> 01:12:23,381
But that's really useful and I think we should

908
01:12:25,546 --> 01:12:28,248
Keep keep that to hand.

909
01:12:29,108 --> 01:12:30,650
Yeah, it's something to think about.

910
01:12:30,690 --> 01:12:35,713
Like I said, you know, with a grain of salt, it doesn't mean that they're the easiest places to fix.

911
01:12:36,554 --> 01:12:41,337
It just means that by this metric there, you know, statistically.

912
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:43,039
Very unsafe.

913
01:12:43,999 --> 01:12:47,142
Yeah, I and I know this is this is a.

914
01:12:48,583 --> 01:12:52,244
there's no perfect metric and you have to come up with a metric somewhere.

915
01:12:52,945 --> 01:13:11,291
But if you have a couple of serious injury or fatality crashes, and it's like one or two over 10 years, and you have two intersections that otherwise have the same number of people getting their foot run over,

916
01:13:13,117 --> 01:13:18,760
and one of them looks more dangerous because those two serious injuries happened in that one spot.

917
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:37,689
That's such a small sample size that by this metric, essentially just statistical noise, means that one of those looks a lot more dangerous than the other, even if they're otherwise would be similar.

918
01:13:41,135 --> 01:13:44,917
And I know there's no perfect metrics for this.

919
01:13:48,039 --> 01:13:51,401
I think that covers that topic.

920
01:13:53,682 --> 01:13:54,662
Anything else on that?

921
01:13:56,783 --> 01:13:59,785
That's kind of to update you, and that's in the works.

922
01:13:59,985 --> 01:14:02,947
And we hope that we'll get some more movement.

923
01:14:05,348 --> 01:14:08,990
It's sort of just a part of our ongoing

924
01:14:10,504 --> 01:14:17,387
issues with getting DCR to help us make the connections from one place to another across Medford.

925
01:14:18,647 --> 01:14:37,595
Next on the agenda says federal grant for blue bike expansion to $21.6 million grant to, I think that's, assume that what that means, to fund blue bike expansion, new transit shuttles, other congestion relief solutions in Metro Boston via MAPC.

926
01:14:40,874 --> 01:14:48,863
I don't know if this is essentially an announcement item or anything else to discuss on that.

927
01:14:49,103 --> 01:14:50,545
There is a link in the agenda.

928
01:14:52,487 --> 01:14:55,110
Bruce, I think you were the one who sent this one to me.

929
01:14:56,511 --> 01:14:57,232
Hang on.

930
01:14:58,554 --> 01:14:59,995
It might have actually been Ernie.

931
01:15:00,155 --> 01:15:00,516
Hold on.

932
01:15:01,919 --> 01:15:08,322
And then maybe something that Todd would have more to say about where the next round of stations will actually go and how much.

933
01:15:09,263 --> 01:15:12,904
How much of this will actually go to mid for getting blue bike stations 1 2nd?

934
01:15:12,944 --> 01:15:14,445
I lost my agenda here.

935
01:15:14,465 --> 01:15:16,026
Here it is.

936
01:15:17,346 --> 01:15:19,107
So, what was this federal grant for?

937
01:15:19,227 --> 01:15:20,948
No, I would not have sent out.

938
01:15:22,009 --> 01:15:24,230
Blue bike expansion grant typically.

939
01:15:25,963 --> 01:15:28,966
Well, that's in there and we have that information.

940
01:15:29,026 --> 01:15:37,453
I think it's it's kind of more of a general announcement until we know a timeline and where they're going to go or if they're asking for suggestions on locations.

941
01:15:38,394 --> 01:15:44,740
Sorry, it was sent to me by Ernie and it looks like he stepped away.

942
01:15:45,321 --> 01:15:50,725
Well, I think it I mean, unless there's something else to discuss about this, I think it's good to know, but there's not.

943
01:15:51,818 --> 01:15:56,981
It needs to trickle a little further through the process before there's a lot to discuss about it.

944
01:16:00,043 --> 01:16:05,866
Ernie, did you have anything else to add about the federal grant to fund Blue Bike expansion?

945
01:16:05,926 --> 01:16:15,652
I think we probably don't need to talk about it beyond saying that it's a thing until there's more information about how many stations we're going to get and where they're going to go.

946
01:16:16,272 --> 01:16:17,813
No, I figured that was the case.

947
01:16:17,933 --> 01:16:20,955
I needed to step away for a second, so excuse me.

948
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:23,084
So nothing to add.

949
01:16:23,164 --> 01:16:23,324
Nope.

950
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:23,924
Okay.

951
01:16:24,344 --> 01:16:25,045
Thanks.

952
01:16:25,645 --> 01:16:27,585
Infrastructure updates were available.

953
01:16:29,986 --> 01:16:44,449
The update that I have is that I asked Todd again, and also Alicia, if we have any word on the bike racks that there supposedly is a grant for.

954
01:16:45,129 --> 01:16:49,830
Does anybody remember, were we hearing that there was a grant for that one year ago or two years ago?

955
01:16:53,672 --> 01:16:55,373
Yeah.

956
01:16:56,294 --> 01:16:58,895
In any case, nothing's been signed yet.

957
01:16:59,636 --> 01:17:00,396
We're still waiting.

958
01:17:01,097 --> 01:17:05,960
We're supposedly getting 40 bike racks citywide out of this round.

959
01:17:07,801 --> 01:17:08,401
That's nice.

960
01:17:08,461 --> 01:17:10,182
And that's 40 more than we have right now.

961
01:17:11,223 --> 01:17:11,903
And that's great.

962
01:17:12,183 --> 01:17:17,507
I feel like I kind of think this was something that Amy tracked down before she left.

963
01:17:19,183 --> 01:17:30,054
In which case it has somehow taken 2 years to not quite get to the point of having a signed contract that will involve getting 40 bike racks and we still don't know when they'll actually get installed.

964
01:17:30,074 --> 01:17:30,114
So.

965
01:17:33,078 --> 01:17:47,387
I think it's also important that if we want to keep getting more bike racks until we eventually actually have enough places to park, that you can go someplace with a friend and both have a rack to lock your bike at.

966
01:17:48,108 --> 01:17:51,250
We have to really keep on the city to add more bike racks.

967
01:17:52,351 --> 01:18:00,156
And if it's going to take a two-year grant process, they need to be starting the two-year grant process for the next round.

968
01:18:02,012 --> 01:18:05,713
Do we email Todd or Tim on this, or both?

969
01:18:06,773 --> 01:18:11,734
I think we start with Todd, and maybe Todd and also the city council and the mayor.

970
01:18:11,754 --> 01:18:23,876
And it could also be a matter of making a recommendation to the city council that they appropriate money to just buy some bike racks and install them.

971
01:18:23,896 --> 01:18:25,156
So.

972
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:32,862
That's do we have do we have comments on that?

973
01:18:32,922 --> 01:18:33,762
Do we have thoughts on that?

974
01:18:36,464 --> 01:18:38,206
What's the chance that we actually get?

975
01:18:38,226 --> 01:18:46,032
Or is this money for buying new racks or money for the installation?

976
01:18:47,393 --> 01:18:50,215
I think this as I understand it, and I could be wrong.

977
01:18:51,516 --> 01:18:54,138
This should cover buying the racks and installing them.

978
01:18:54,158 --> 01:18:55,078
OK.

979
01:18:58,532 --> 01:19:12,320
And I have, and I think we have been told in the past that having the personnel to install them is really the sticking point more than the purchase price.

980
01:19:15,582 --> 01:19:21,586
But one way or another, we are still not getting any bike racks out of it.

981
01:19:21,606 --> 01:19:24,288
Do we know if that's,

982
01:19:26,021 --> 01:19:32,726
If they're hiring an external contractor to do it or does it, is this going through?

983
01:19:32,746 --> 01:19:34,347
I don't know.

984
01:19:35,268 --> 01:19:35,788
I don't know.

985
01:19:35,868 --> 01:19:44,314
And I don't know if it would end up being different because it's grant money that has to be spent in more specific ways than if the city was just spending its own budget.

986
01:19:46,296 --> 01:19:46,716
I don't know.

987
01:19:46,736 --> 01:19:50,139
So I,

988
01:19:53,418 --> 01:19:55,279
Yeah, that's where we are with that.

989
01:19:55,499 --> 01:20:06,884
We probably need to just keep on that and keep on the city to start the process of the next round after these 40.

990
01:20:08,385 --> 01:20:19,010
I think according to the map that we have put together, this number would cover the first tier and part of the second tier.

991
01:20:20,252 --> 01:20:22,813
And the map kind of has three priority tiers.

992
01:20:23,654 --> 01:20:38,641
If all three tiers were finished, that would mean there would be at least one bike rack in most business district areas, or at least one bike rack, I think, in all the business district areas on most blocks.

993
01:20:40,322 --> 01:20:43,323
And in some of the highest demand areas, there would be two.

994
01:20:45,504 --> 01:20:47,966
So even if they finished the whole map,

995
01:20:49,001 --> 01:20:52,663
you know, Medford has a lot of area that needs bike racks and doesn't have them.

996
01:20:53,143 --> 01:21:03,870
So even if they finished the whole map, that wouldn't be enough to necessarily like have four people meet up at the same restaurant and all lock their bikes up at bike racks.

997
01:21:05,451 --> 01:21:17,698
Do we know enough about the DPW hierarchy to know if they have any leeway in following through on the projects that they're directed to do by Todd or Tim?

998
01:21:19,497 --> 01:21:23,120
I mean, I'm not sure what you mean by that.

999
01:21:24,180 --> 01:21:27,803
Well, I think it tells his staff to do something.

1000
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:39,612
I assume that his staff about the installation of the racks that they might be on a list of to do things for the DPW, but because some of those members are kind of anti biking.

1001
01:21:41,477 --> 01:21:43,078
I don't think that's that.

1002
01:21:43,138 --> 01:21:46,900
I think if they get assigned to stick this pole in the ground, they go stick this pole in the ground.

1003
01:21:47,540 --> 01:21:49,721
I don't think that's the hang up.

1004
01:21:51,382 --> 01:21:52,983
They don't have the racks yet in any case.

1005
01:21:56,645 --> 01:22:04,570
They are still waiting for some stuff to be signed before they can spend the money and buy the racks.

1006
01:22:05,631 --> 01:22:06,611
We are not at that point.

1007
01:22:07,312 --> 01:22:09,073
My remark is premature.

1008
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:12,594
Do we have anything else?

1009
01:22:14,575 --> 01:22:36,172
I just wanted to comment that I'm somewhat pleasantly surprised, as I sometimes bike in parts of the city I haven't been to for a while, that I see more and more bike infrastructure making its way in, mostly in bike lanes, some sharrows, but I'm glad to see that, and I guess I have to give credit to Todd mostly for pushing a lot of that forward.

1010
01:22:36,773 --> 01:22:39,095
So credit due, I guess.

1011
01:22:39,836 --> 01:22:47,280
Yeah, I think Todd really has been pushing hard for the things that we want, so we're really very fortunate to have him.

1012
01:22:47,300 --> 01:22:49,621
Leah, I see your hand up.

1013
01:22:51,493 --> 01:22:54,035
Thanks, let's figure out the video.

1014
01:22:54,055 --> 01:22:54,555
There we go.

1015
01:22:55,376 --> 01:22:56,116
Change my shirt.

1016
01:22:57,377 --> 01:22:59,719
I have 2 things.

1017
01:22:59,739 --> 01:23:00,840
1 is that.

1018
01:23:00,860 --> 01:23:11,908
I think it just for us to note that there was that petition to the city council that went through about lowering the.

1019
01:23:12,909 --> 01:23:15,091
State owned road speed limits to 25 miles per hour.

1020
01:23:17,839 --> 01:23:23,287
I don't know if we'd ever want to officially sign on to at some point or if we have.

1021
01:23:23,307 --> 01:23:27,953
I don't know that we have, but I think we certainly should.

1022
01:23:29,033 --> 01:23:35,837
Yeah, and the second is a question which is like maybe.

1023
01:23:36,658 --> 01:23:38,979
And I have another thing that I remembered too, but go ahead, go ahead.

1024
01:23:39,259 --> 01:23:46,924
Would this be a good time to ask about the city's repaving list for the spring?

1025
01:23:46,944 --> 01:23:56,670
I noticed that they have a list of stuff that they were completing in the fall, but it's just crack sealing and patching, so there's really no opportunity to

1026
01:23:57,663 --> 01:24:07,182
Do any striping changes, but I have to assume that if they're doing stuff in the spring now would be sort of the time to take a look at those streets.

1027
01:24:08,551 --> 01:24:27,815
Yeah, that's a that's a good thought and I can or Daniel and I can contact Todd about those things will need to so we need to ask about the paving schedule for the for the spring and what what streets could have some we could have some input on.

1028
01:24:30,364 --> 01:24:42,252
And to your other point, I think it would be great to pass a motion saying that we support lowering the state-owned street speed limit to 25 as well.

1029
01:24:47,736 --> 01:24:50,258
Just in case, I'm not going to put that one forward.

1030
01:24:51,839 --> 01:24:52,619
Okay, fair enough.

1031
01:24:53,620 --> 01:24:55,221
Do we have a motion to... Ernie?

1032
01:24:58,363 --> 01:25:05,606
Well, just in the holiday spirit, I still have a 10 pack of white lights in a box in the front hall.

1033
01:25:05,946 --> 01:25:07,726
Can we circle back to that really quick?

1034
01:25:08,166 --> 01:25:09,607
Can we circle back to that in a second?

1035
01:25:10,047 --> 01:25:11,828
I thought you were calling for adjournment.

1036
01:25:12,248 --> 01:25:12,728
I'm sorry.

1037
01:25:13,328 --> 01:25:13,708
No.

1038
01:25:13,788 --> 01:25:21,711
May I make a motion that the MBACC endorse lowering the speed limit on state roads in Medford to 25 miles an hour?

1039
01:25:24,012 --> 01:25:24,812
Do we have a second?

1040
01:25:25,173 --> 01:25:26,053
I can second that now.

1041
01:25:29,217 --> 01:25:29,898
All in favor?

1042
01:25:29,918 --> 01:25:31,859
Aye.

1043
01:25:32,540 --> 01:25:33,160
All opposed?

1044
01:25:35,102 --> 01:25:36,223
Okay, motion passes.

1045
01:25:36,283 --> 01:25:43,809
Daniel, you and I need to contact the Mayor and City Council and say that we support that effort.

1046
01:25:45,510 --> 01:25:46,291
I'm abstaining.

1047
01:25:47,192 --> 01:25:47,432
Yes.

1048
01:25:49,734 --> 01:25:50,094
Thank you.

1049
01:25:50,955 --> 01:25:52,376
And I'm just going to make myself a note.

1050
01:25:55,862 --> 01:25:59,503
Actually, technically, in a case like that, you should call for a roll call.

1051
01:26:00,264 --> 01:26:04,565
But again, it's a de facto roll call, since she's the only one who said she abstained.

1052
01:26:05,486 --> 01:26:05,726
Right.

1053
01:26:06,466 --> 01:26:08,947
OK, then good.

1054
01:26:11,148 --> 01:26:11,608
Where was I?

1055
01:26:11,908 --> 01:26:19,231
Oh, there was one other announcement about a serious injury of a pedestrian crossing at

1056
01:26:21,467 --> 01:26:26,712
Um, mystic valley parkway by up by the mystic lakes and what was the cross street?

1057
01:26:26,732 --> 01:26:30,015
Oh, yeah, ravine road right near where I walk all the time.

1058
01:26:30,415 --> 01:26:30,735
Yeah.

1059
01:26:31,416 --> 01:26:33,338
Across that crosswalk many.

1060
01:26:33,978 --> 01:26:38,863
Many days of the week, do you have do you want to say anything about that?

1061
01:26:39,383 --> 01:26:40,184
Bruce, since you.

1062
01:26:42,125 --> 01:26:44,668
The speed limit is 25 miles an hour on the parkway.

1063
01:26:46,662 --> 01:26:49,483
Most cars do about 30, which is not unreasonable.

1064
01:26:50,484 --> 01:26:59,027
And of course, a minority, but large enough, you know, create like an expressway and we'll be cruising past at 50 miles an hour.

1065
01:27:01,621 --> 01:27:06,862
In the evening, there tend to be frequent motorcycle drag races, it sounds like.

1066
01:27:08,303 --> 01:27:14,104
I can't, well, I was only out there once when there were a bunch of them, but that's not so much relevant for what happened there.

1067
01:27:15,304 --> 01:27:26,067
I don't know the details of the crash, although I think I read that the driver said the person stepped in front of them, but it is a crosswalk.

1068
01:27:26,127 --> 01:27:26,847
It's well marked.

1069
01:27:26,907 --> 01:27:30,868
It's one of the few crosswalks that are actually on Mystic Valley Parkway.

1070
01:27:32,449 --> 01:27:35,031
I think the next 1 is probably a Shannon beach.

1071
01:27:35,752 --> 01:27:41,076
And then up at bacon street, there is no crosswalk at high street on the rotary.

1072
01:27:41,096 --> 01:27:46,741
The visibility at ravine road is a little bit.

1073
01:27:47,182 --> 01:27:47,442
I know.

1074
01:27:47,482 --> 01:27:47,662
Sorry.

1075
01:27:47,922 --> 01:27:48,963
Yeah, that was ravine road.

1076
01:27:49,904 --> 01:27:52,026
It's a little bit limited.

1077
01:27:52,046 --> 01:27:54,508
I know that, for example.

1078
01:27:55,990 --> 01:28:03,337
When I'm riding my bike out, I will deliberately come out at Sagamore so that I can see left and right on Mystic Valley Parkway.

1079
01:28:03,858 --> 01:28:09,182
But on the way home, I will turn onto Ravine because it's a more direct route.

1080
01:28:09,483 --> 01:28:12,245
If somebody is traveling at the speed limit, it's not an issue.

1081
01:28:12,745 --> 01:28:16,369
If they're traveling 50 miles an hour, it's potentially an issue.

1082
01:28:16,389 --> 01:28:20,312
I don't think the injuries were particularly serious.

1083
01:28:21,254 --> 01:28:28,385
From what I read, I believe a dog was injured and taken to, they said a nearby vet, of which there was one just down the street.

1084
01:28:28,405 --> 01:28:30,668
I don't know if that's what actually happened.

1085
01:28:31,329 --> 01:28:34,594
And I do not know the individual who was struck by the car.

1086
01:28:36,334 --> 01:28:42,760
Can I ask if it was north or southbound vehicular, or the car was traveling south or north?

1087
01:28:42,780 --> 01:28:44,121
Because that's important.

1088
01:28:44,201 --> 01:28:47,705
I don't know that the report, that the news article mentioned it.

1089
01:28:47,765 --> 01:28:48,586
Okay, I've driven that.

1090
01:28:48,606 --> 01:29:00,357
I think it was north, and I feel like I saw a photo of maybe of a police car or something in the intersection that made me think it was north, but I could be wrong about that.

1091
01:29:01,062 --> 01:29:12,733
Yeah, I've driven on that every day for, you know, going on 40 years now, mostly with cars, used it as a test track when selling cars.

1092
01:29:13,754 --> 01:29:16,936
At the south end, where Bruce is talking about,

1093
01:29:17,817 --> 01:29:31,571
one has to know if you're starting there you accelerate you can get into the 50s pretty easily to through the twisties however coming back heading southbound where is where it constricts

1094
01:29:32,487 --> 01:29:35,129
very tightly and is hellish.

1095
01:29:35,830 --> 01:29:50,202
And that crosswalk there is an unfortunate invitation for pedestrians because it's not well lit, it should have blinking side markers, and it's impossible to see on a wet surface.

1096
01:29:51,163 --> 01:30:08,098
So southbound traffic coming down from 45, 40 to the old speed limit of 35, not knowing they should be going 25, can only be further, I think, softened by the introduction of a

1097
01:30:09,000 --> 01:30:22,188
relatively benign 25 mile an hour speed bump, just as is and exactly like as is duplicated on Grove Street for the same purpose.

1098
01:30:22,969 --> 01:30:26,351
You can come down Grove Street in a car from Winchester.

1099
01:30:26,871 --> 01:30:31,754
You can easily go 35 or 40, 35 being the old speed limit.

1100
01:30:32,354 --> 01:30:37,037
And then the warning too, that it's going to get congested after the cemetery to 25.

1101
01:30:38,938 --> 01:30:52,648
is enabled brilliantly by a perfectly non-violent 25 mile an hour speed bump and a speed monitoring beacon on the right.

1102
01:30:53,348 --> 01:30:58,432
If they were to do that on Mystic Valley Parkway, I think that problem would go away.

1103
01:31:00,813 --> 01:31:02,915
It'd just be the safest thing to do.

1104
01:31:04,816 --> 01:31:10,439
Yeah, so I think that... Replicate what they did on Grove Street, or what the city did on Grove Street.

1105
01:31:11,900 --> 01:31:15,362
Right, and of course, this is a DCR road, too, so... That's the problem.

1106
01:31:16,382 --> 01:31:24,987
Yeah, so... We should also be aware that there's a redesign currently in effect for the parkway and the trail adjacent to it.

1107
01:31:25,807 --> 01:31:26,087
Right.

1108
01:31:26,107 --> 01:31:33,171
We don't know if it's serious yet, if it's at what they would call 25% or if it's still at concept.

1109
01:31:33,767 --> 01:31:42,549
Is that south of high street or is that or is there no, it's between high street and the Shannon beach area.

1110
01:31:43,089 --> 01:31:44,849
So, I didn't realize that.

1111
01:31:44,909 --> 01:31:47,950
Okay.

1112
01:31:47,970 --> 01:31:53,011
I don't think I've heard of it being at 25%, but that I don't think I have either.

1113
01:31:53,051 --> 01:31:53,831
That's what I was asking.

1114
01:31:53,911 --> 01:31:55,351
I think it's, I think it's concept.

1115
01:31:55,991 --> 01:31:59,952
Yeah, well, maybe this will bump it up the queue, but.

1116
01:32:02,247 --> 01:32:04,568
Um, do we have short term short term fixes?

1117
01:32:04,608 --> 01:32:04,809
Ernie?

1118
01:32:04,829 --> 01:32:07,990
I agree with you that something like that would actually be useful.

1119
01:32:08,631 --> 01:32:09,531
Because, um.

1120
01:32:10,932 --> 01:32:17,515
It's it's being used as a pretty major commuter thoroughfare, both by bicyclists and by motor traffic.

1121
01:32:18,896 --> 01:32:21,498
Commercial traffic is not permitted, which is 1 saving grace.

1122
01:32:22,355 --> 01:32:36,121
But yeah, I wish that most of the cars behave like most of the cars do, like all the cars would behave like most of them, because generally people are not traveling at ridiculous speeds, but it only takes 10%, right?

1123
01:32:37,021 --> 01:32:41,463
Sure, and the speed bump will take care of dragging motorcyclists too.

1124
01:32:42,424 --> 01:32:42,664
Yeah.

1125
01:32:43,304 --> 01:32:43,884
It really will.

1126
01:32:45,905 --> 01:32:49,487
Especially when you're decelerating into tight corners,

1127
01:32:50,674 --> 01:33:00,102
The one, you know, it's hard enough to see a wet cross rock, but to have to negotiate a speed bump is suicidal.

1128
01:33:00,502 --> 01:33:02,383
So you just, you do slow down.

1129
01:33:04,825 --> 01:33:09,949
So there, hopefully that will get bumped up the queue.

1130
01:33:09,970 --> 01:33:13,672
Do we have a recommendation coming out of this that we want to vote on or not?

1131
01:33:14,757 --> 01:33:18,759
Um, I think it was just on the agenda as an announcement of that incident.

1132
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:23,522
But, um, but I think they're just as.

1133
01:33:24,202 --> 01:33:43,633
Yeah, just to be to be aware that it was that it happened, but I think especially if we're hoping to get more attention from DCR via the spot with the guardrail, this would absolutely be a good example of, you know, while we have another data point and another point that these are.

1134
01:33:44,657 --> 01:33:59,444
You know, we sort of picked the guardrail spot as an example, not as like the one spot that we think is the most dangerous, more of a, you know, we need some attention on these roads.

1135
01:33:59,684 --> 01:34:01,845
It's a somebody's going to get killed here spot.

1136
01:34:02,365 --> 01:34:02,605
Right.

1137
01:34:02,625 --> 01:34:03,165
Yeah.

1138
01:34:03,345 --> 01:34:03,805
Right.

1139
01:34:03,825 --> 01:34:10,849
You know, we picked it as a poster child, not as the one spot that's dangerous.

1140
01:34:13,435 --> 01:34:18,539
So this is absolutely another spot that would be on that list.

1141
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:21,862
Ernie, you had something about bike lights?

1142
01:34:22,242 --> 01:34:24,864
Yeah, just that there's an event over the winter.

1143
01:34:26,683 --> 01:34:31,885
or someone's attending a citywide event and wants to distribute bike lights.

1144
01:34:33,306 --> 01:34:39,530
You know, I have a 10-pack sitting in the front hall and a USPS priority box.

1145
01:34:39,570 --> 01:34:45,713
You can just come grab it any time between now and the next meeting and thereafter too.

1146
01:34:45,733 --> 01:34:53,758
I won't do the mass distribution until the spring of all the schools from the next shipment.

1147
01:34:54,860 --> 01:35:01,025
But there are some around if you want some for any miscellaneous reason.

1148
01:35:01,705 --> 01:35:08,991
Ernie, would you do me a favor and also just make that as an announcement on the email list so that anyone who's not here has it and has your address?

1149
01:35:10,032 --> 01:35:11,553
I think that's an allowable thing to do.

1150
01:35:12,453 --> 01:35:16,937
We are also down to five because Leah had to leave too.

1151
01:35:19,098 --> 01:35:22,001
And we are through our agenda, but I think we don't have quorum anymore.

1152
01:35:26,275 --> 01:35:28,982
Do we naturally defuse or do we formally leave?

1153
01:35:29,523 --> 01:35:30,907
Well, we could still discuss it.

1154
01:35:31,047 --> 01:35:33,152
I heard that phrase seconded.

1155
01:35:34,015 --> 01:35:34,456
Thank you.

1156
01:35:35,578 --> 01:35:37,242
All in favor of adjourning for tonight?

1157
01:35:37,704 --> 01:35:38,786
Aye.

1158
01:35:39,288 --> 01:35:39,929
All opposed?

1159
01:35:41,954 --> 01:35:42,335
All right.

1160
01:35:42,596 --> 01:35:43,398
Thank you, everybody.
