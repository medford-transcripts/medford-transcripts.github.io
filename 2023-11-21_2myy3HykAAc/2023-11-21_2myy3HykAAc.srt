1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:04,591
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you got everyone.

2
00:00:06,592 --> 00:00:10,614
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion is approved for in the affirmative three absent.

3
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:15,337
[SPEAKER_09]: We will adjourn to executive session and be back here at approximately 615.

4
00:00:15,537 --> 00:00:15,997
[SPEAKER_09]: Thanks everyone.

5
01:57:52,288 --> 01:57:55,591
[SPEAKER_09]: I would like to welcome our two student reps.

6
01:57:55,831 --> 01:57:59,794
[SPEAKER_09]: So tonight we have Darren Trong and Noah Urasko with us.

7
01:58:00,034 --> 01:58:00,494
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.

8
01:58:01,675 --> 01:58:12,343
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll try not to make this meeting last until forever, but if you all have to leave at some point in time, you don't need anybody's permission, but we would love to have you.

9
01:58:12,383 --> 01:58:21,029
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you would like to speak, if you could just tap Kathy on the shoulder and she will be happy to give you a microphone so you can speak and you're welcome to speak on any item.

10
01:58:21,269 --> 01:58:22,590
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you guys for being here.

11
01:58:22,670 --> 01:58:24,471
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me, point of information.

12
01:58:24,491 --> 01:58:27,353
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's Nicholas, you're asking.

13
01:58:29,034 --> 01:58:30,896
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, is it Nicholas or Noah?

14
01:58:31,376 --> 01:58:31,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Noah, OK.

15
01:58:40,422 --> 01:58:50,429
[SPEAKER_09]: Also with us tonight, I want to congratulate Nicole Branley, Erica Reinfeld, and Aaron Olapade, who will be joining us officially as members starting January

16
01:58:51,673 --> 01:58:54,134
[SPEAKER_09]: inauguration day, first, second, third, one of those days.

17
01:58:55,074 --> 01:58:55,734
[SPEAKER_09]: So welcome.

18
01:58:55,974 --> 01:59:03,716
[SPEAKER_09]: As is customary at the school committee, we invite newly elected members to join us behind the rail so they can start to learn the process.

19
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:07,637
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a big job and it's not one for which there's lots of training.

20
01:59:07,797 --> 01:59:09,257
[SPEAKER_09]: So welcome.

21
01:59:10,418 --> 01:59:14,439
[SPEAKER_09]: We are all here to support you as you onboard and to answer any questions you have.

22
01:59:15,980 --> 01:59:20,063
[SPEAKER_09]: They will be behind the rail with us tonight and for the next couple of meetings as they're able.

23
01:59:20,824 --> 01:59:29,631
[SPEAKER_09]: And with the one caveat that if they would like to speak, they will have the same privileges as any member of the speaking audience because they're not quite on the committee yet.

24
01:59:29,692 --> 01:59:37,258
[SPEAKER_09]: So enjoy your time as a pseudo member of the committee and also just a regular member of the public.

25
01:59:38,739 --> 01:59:40,820
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you and welcome, congratulations.

26
01:59:42,220 --> 01:59:44,921
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we have a motion to revert to the regular order of business?

27
01:59:45,461 --> 01:59:47,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Motion to revert to the regular order of business.

28
01:59:48,501 --> 01:59:52,262
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to revert to the regular order of business by member McLaughlin, seconded by?

29
01:59:52,602 --> 01:59:52,922
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

30
01:59:53,182 --> 01:59:54,943
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Kreatz, all those in favor?

31
01:59:54,963 --> 01:59:56,163
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

32
01:59:56,483 --> 01:59:57,183
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

33
01:59:59,224 --> 02:00:00,224
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, motion passes.

34
02:00:00,344 --> 02:00:01,924
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have good of the order.

35
02:00:02,044 --> 02:00:04,045
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to take good of the order off the table.

36
02:00:05,058 --> 02:00:06,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh no, we're good.

37
02:00:06,418 --> 02:00:07,458
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have good of the order.

38
02:00:08,159 --> 02:00:20,961
[SPEAKER_09]: And for those of you who are new, the good of the order is a time and a moment where on a monthly basis as a committee, we have an opening to talk about and reflect on sort of how the committee is working.

39
02:00:21,021 --> 02:00:25,822
[SPEAKER_09]: So when we talk about the good of the order, we're talking about the order of the school committee and how we're carrying out our rules and policies.

40
02:00:26,962 --> 02:00:27,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin.

41
02:00:30,082 --> 02:00:30,502
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

42
02:00:31,783 --> 02:00:33,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Just two things I wanted to mention are

43
02:00:34,718 --> 02:00:35,819
[SPEAKER_10]: bring up to our colleagues.

44
02:00:35,939 --> 02:00:49,730
[SPEAKER_10]: One is we, member Rousseau, member Graham and myself were at the association of school committee conference the day after the election for a couple of days.

45
02:00:49,870 --> 02:00:53,112
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was a really informative conference and session.

46
02:00:53,212 --> 02:01:03,520
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'd like to, if my colleagues and the rest of the committee are in agreement, like to provide maybe for the next meeting, just a summary session of our, of our sessions.

47
02:01:04,455 --> 02:01:12,463
[SPEAKER_10]: to our colleagues so they can know the sessions that we went to and what we learned when we were there, and maybe just a little bit about the MASC conference.

48
02:01:13,824 --> 02:01:16,687
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't know that that needs to be voted on, but just putting that on the floor.

49
02:01:17,247 --> 02:01:18,268
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the other is

50
02:01:20,816 --> 02:01:22,396
[SPEAKER_10]: orientation for our new members.

51
02:01:22,717 --> 02:01:37,221
[SPEAKER_10]: So this is something that's been discussed previously and, you know, something that we had made some motions and passed some motions on, and I wanted to ensure that that is happening prior to the start date of our new members.

52
02:01:37,853 --> 02:01:40,614
[SPEAKER_10]: So orientation or shortly after the start date of our new members.

53
02:01:40,654 --> 02:01:52,638
[SPEAKER_10]: Certainly, I think there can be some documentation and or meeting provided, either, you know, with the vice chair and the mayor or the superintendent or what have you, just for some initial orientation.

54
02:01:53,159 --> 02:01:59,721
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe, you know, we can collaborate on a Google Doc or something, because we've been talking about this for about since we were elected, I think.

55
02:02:00,750 --> 02:02:01,210
[SPEAKER_10]: initially.

56
02:02:01,791 --> 02:02:18,817
[SPEAKER_10]: So just to provide them with some material before the actual start date and then also shortly after the orientation, if we could book and I don't know if the superintendent wants to do this or if it's something that is done through the vice chair, what have you, but something maybe with, I guess, Dorothy's retiring.

57
02:02:18,837 --> 02:02:22,298
[SPEAKER_10]: Dorothy Presser is our representative for the MASC who does a lot of the training.

58
02:02:23,050 --> 02:02:27,751
[SPEAKER_10]: and we learned at the last session at the MASC actually that she'll be retiring shortly.

59
02:02:28,151 --> 02:02:40,554
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll have another wrap or if we don't already, but it would be great to maybe have a, you know, training and orientation reorientation with our MASC wrap for maybe, you know, January, February.

60
02:02:41,174 --> 02:02:44,195
[SPEAKER_10]: So who would actually schedule that?

61
02:02:44,215 --> 02:02:45,376
[SPEAKER_10]: Would that be you, Dr. Eby?

62
02:02:45,616 --> 02:02:45,796
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

63
02:02:46,176 --> 02:02:49,296
[SPEAKER_10]: Would you, is that, okay.

64
02:02:49,377 --> 02:02:51,217
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I think that's it for me for good of the order.

65
02:02:52,028 --> 02:02:55,352
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think just to follow on to that, if I may, as the chair.

66
02:02:56,614 --> 02:03:00,358
[SPEAKER_09]: We've been in communication with the new members about tonight.

67
02:03:00,419 --> 02:03:01,300
[SPEAKER_09]: That's why they're all here.

68
02:03:01,460 --> 02:03:03,082
[SPEAKER_09]: We made sure they got packets.

69
02:03:03,122 --> 02:03:05,084
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Miss Malone for your help.

70
02:03:05,925 --> 02:03:09,530
[SPEAKER_09]: And the superintendent is working through their onboarding process in the paperwork and

71
02:03:10,454 --> 02:03:15,635
[SPEAKER_09]: setting up a meeting and some time to go in and meet with central office to start to get to know them.

72
02:03:16,136 --> 02:03:21,617
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a process that will take years, probably by the time it's all said and done.

73
02:03:22,717 --> 02:03:24,718
[SPEAKER_09]: But certainly to start there.

74
02:03:25,198 --> 02:03:31,860
[SPEAKER_09]: I was in touch with MASC last week about the upcoming charting the course dates.

75
02:03:32,440 --> 02:03:33,640
[SPEAKER_09]: They've not yet been set.

76
02:03:34,200 --> 02:03:39,182
[SPEAKER_09]: But statutorily, you're all required to attend a one-day training session just one time.

77
02:03:40,602 --> 02:03:44,323
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's actually a great refresher for all members of the school committee.

78
02:03:44,343 --> 02:03:54,946
[SPEAKER_09]: And it covers everything from how meetings run and the open meeting law, all the way through to the budget and all the other responsibilities of the school committee.

79
02:03:55,915 --> 02:04:06,081
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a pretty fast and furious kind of training, and it leaves you having maybe more questions than less, but at least you know what those questions are at the end of the time, and we can guide from there.

80
02:04:07,362 --> 02:04:16,267
[SPEAKER_09]: We also were talking last week, the superintendent and I, about doing a training retreat, which we often do at the start of term.

81
02:04:16,887 --> 02:04:22,651
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the other request that I made to the superintendent is that we actually schedule some time with Tracy Novick to talk about

82
02:04:23,792 --> 02:04:38,355
[SPEAKER_09]: budget and school funding in particular, because Chapter 70 is very complicated and it is changing with the Student Opportunity Act, and she does sessions that are finance-oriented that I think will be helpful, particularly as we

83
02:04:38,905 --> 02:04:44,589
[SPEAKER_09]: that one of the biggest things that you will do in the first six months of your tenure is set the budget.

84
02:04:44,689 --> 02:04:52,954
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's a really complex process for a lot of reasons, but sort of understanding where the funding comes from is super important.

85
02:04:52,994 --> 02:05:00,799
[SPEAKER_09]: So we'll look to schedule both of those sessions, probably not at the same time, but over the course of the first couple of months.

86
02:05:00,939 --> 02:05:07,323
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I think we do need to work offline on that orientation and onboarding, and I will connect with you separately on that.

87
02:05:07,793 --> 02:05:08,213
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

88
02:05:08,373 --> 02:05:09,013
[SPEAKER_10]: May I follow up?

89
02:05:09,234 --> 02:05:09,414
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

90
02:05:10,494 --> 02:05:33,762
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so, and also just to be very clear, what I'm asking for for the training is the orientation training is different than charting the life course, which I think you got that, but I just want to be really clear for the, our colleagues as well, um, that it's more sort of about orientation and that explicitly, I would love it if, um, Dr. Evey, if you could ask MASC to include in the orientation, you know, a Robert's rules of order,

91
02:05:34,430 --> 02:05:38,727
[SPEAKER_10]: aspect to that so that folks know that parliamentary procedure and just sort of how that works.

92
02:05:39,871 --> 02:05:44,696
[SPEAKER_10]: if we could, and then additionally, I know that this has been a longstanding thing, but the rest of us need it as well.

93
02:05:44,736 --> 02:05:50,801
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe after the first, we can all get IDs so that we have access to the schools.

94
02:05:51,041 --> 02:05:58,688
[SPEAKER_10]: Not that we, obviously we know we don't just show up, whatever, but more so that we have an identification to be able to access our schools.

95
02:05:58,748 --> 02:06:05,594
[SPEAKER_10]: So clearly when you're doing the orientation with our new members, for the members that are staying, it would be great to have an ID as well.

96
02:06:06,694 --> 02:06:12,919
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the last thing I'll say about onboarding, I know that member Rousseau has also sent you a copy of our rules document.

97
02:06:14,040 --> 02:06:17,182
[SPEAKER_09]: We have that for the first time really in ever.

98
02:06:17,722 --> 02:06:33,674
[SPEAKER_09]: So I know there's a lot of rules there and it's overwhelming, but the goal of those rules is really to say like, how can we function most effectively as a body so that we can get the work done of the committee, which is quite particular under the law and then

99
02:06:34,658 --> 02:06:37,442
[SPEAKER_09]: also have some mechanisms to manage everything else that comes their way.

100
02:06:37,662 --> 02:06:43,489
[SPEAKER_09]: So there'll be plenty of opportunity to change the rules and we'll talk all about all of those processes as we go.

101
02:06:45,512 --> 02:06:48,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Other questions from the committee about the good of the order?

102
02:06:53,482 --> 02:06:53,722
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

103
02:06:55,516 --> 02:06:58,558
[SPEAKER_09]: Then we will move on to item number five, which is the consent agenda.

104
02:06:59,078 --> 02:07:08,846
[SPEAKER_09]: It includes bills and payrolls, regular school committee minutes from October 16th, committee of the whole minutes from November 1st, and committee of the whole minutes from November 15th.

105
02:07:09,486 --> 02:07:10,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion on the floor?

106
02:07:11,348 --> 02:07:14,851
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to approve by Member McLaughlin, seconded by Member Hays.

107
02:07:14,931 --> 02:07:15,751
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

108
02:07:15,771 --> 02:07:16,792
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

109
02:07:17,272 --> 02:07:17,973
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

110
02:07:19,154 --> 02:07:19,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

111
02:07:21,179 --> 02:07:26,984
[SPEAKER_09]: We have no report of subcommittees, so we are on to the report of the superintendent, and I will turn it over to Dr. Edward Vincent.

112
02:07:30,067 --> 02:07:31,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you and good evening.

113
02:07:31,328 --> 02:07:41,055
[SPEAKER_06]: I, too, want to welcome all of our new members to your very first member elect to the Medford School Committee.

114
02:07:41,135 --> 02:07:43,637
[SPEAKER_06]: So welcome aboard and welcome to our students.

115
02:07:44,338 --> 02:07:49,983
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know we'll be able to meet the other students in the coming weeks, but welcome to all of you.

116
02:07:51,314 --> 02:07:53,858
[SPEAKER_06]: So good evening, Thanksgiving break is almost here.

117
02:07:53,878 --> 02:08:07,097
[SPEAKER_06]: And in the spirit of Thanksgiving, I would like to thank all our parents, caregivers, students, staff, everyone in the MPS community who has truly been generous this time of year.

118
02:08:09,639 --> 02:08:22,769
[SPEAKER_06]: We've had multiple drives at almost all of our schools, collecting canned goods and really giving back to the community and to those in need, to food pantries, to churches.

119
02:08:23,609 --> 02:08:27,993
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just been extreme generosity of our Medford community.

120
02:08:28,173 --> 02:08:32,276
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to thank everyone for thinking of others during this Thanksgiving season.

121
02:08:34,358 --> 02:08:45,311
[SPEAKER_06]: I also wanna say that this week being Thanksgiving week, Wednesday, November 22nd is early release day, early release for everyone.

122
02:08:45,411 --> 02:08:54,882
[SPEAKER_06]: So please keep in mind if your child is at the middle schools, they get out at 1130, the high school and elementary schools get out at noon.

123
02:08:55,562 --> 02:08:57,404
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's important for this Wednesday.

124
02:08:57,984 --> 02:09:00,026
[SPEAKER_06]: Thursday, as you know, is Thanksgiving.

125
02:09:00,166 --> 02:09:02,928
[SPEAKER_06]: Friday, Black Friday for shopping.

126
02:09:03,828 --> 02:09:05,430
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a wonderful long weekend.

127
02:09:05,490 --> 02:09:08,392
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're traveling, please be safe on the roads.

128
02:09:09,673 --> 02:09:15,617
[SPEAKER_06]: I have some great news to share about some wonderful accomplishments across Mustang Nation.

129
02:09:16,858 --> 02:09:35,082
[SPEAKER_06]: So on Saturday, 13 students from the Model United Nations Club from Medford High School, they traveled to Catholic Memorial slash the Ursuline Conference in West Roxbury.

130
02:09:35,102 --> 02:09:41,504
[SPEAKER_06]: And over 200 students from across the region attended this conference.

131
02:09:42,924 --> 02:09:47,906
[SPEAKER_06]: The students did wonderfully, and our team earned five awards.

132
02:09:48,707 --> 02:09:50,548
[SPEAKER_06]: So congratulations to all of them.

133
02:09:51,668 --> 02:10:01,193
[SPEAKER_06]: On the 30-year award committee, Evan Russell and Shane Chaudry earned honorable mentions in their delegate roles.

134
02:10:02,453 --> 02:10:12,978
[SPEAKER_06]: On the Venezuelan crisis committee, Brian DePosito earned the People's Choice Award and Outstanding Delegate.

166
02:14:12,498 --> 02:14:14,621

167
02:14:17,139 --> 02:14:22,024
[SPEAKER_06]: A special donation of a partnership and a discount program.

168
02:14:22,584 --> 02:14:26,008
[SPEAKER_06]: K&G men's company of Somerville has donated.

169
02:14:26,028 --> 02:14:27,849
[SPEAKER_06]: The amount is small.

170
02:14:28,870 --> 02:14:31,393
[SPEAKER_06]: However, it was a percentage of what was purchased.

171
02:14:31,473 --> 02:14:32,974
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is something that will grow.

172
02:14:33,415 --> 02:14:40,061
[SPEAKER_06]: But they did donate $34.20 back to the district based on a percentage of what was sold.

173
02:14:40,902 --> 02:14:47,070
[SPEAKER_06]: And we want us to continue to work with them and they will continue to give a percentage back to the district.

174
02:14:47,610 --> 02:14:50,274
[SPEAKER_06]: And this was for prom clothing purchases.

175
02:14:50,714 --> 02:14:57,142
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're very grateful for that partnership from the spring of 23 with K and G men's company of some of our.

176
02:14:58,283 --> 02:15:06,244
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, because the donation was less than $50, the school committee is not required to formally approve the contribution.

177
02:15:07,425 --> 02:15:14,106
[SPEAKER_06]: But we wanted to definitely acknowledge a great program and say thank you, a special thank you to K&G.

178
02:15:15,186 --> 02:15:21,327

179
02:15:21,927 --> 02:15:25,768

[SPEAKER_04]: The bus duty pass has been a monster so far this year.

274
02:24:35,800 --> 02:24:40,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the thing, when you call in, we're going to be playing a song over the announcements.

275
02:24:40,622 --> 02:24:43,544
[SPEAKER_04]: When we stop the song, we're looking for the fourth caller.

276
02:24:43,564 --> 02:24:47,966
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to have to unmute in their classroom, and they're going to have to finish the lyric.

277
02:24:48,246 --> 02:24:49,507
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to finish the lyric.

278
02:24:49,967 --> 02:24:52,268
[SPEAKER_04]: Bus duty pass on the line if you've got a good voice.

279
02:24:52,348 --> 02:24:53,789
[SPEAKER_04]: And we would love for your class to sing it.

280
02:24:55,635 --> 02:24:59,198
[SPEAKER_11]: So just to clarify, Mr. Petrales was offering a bus duty pass.

281
02:24:59,999 --> 02:25:06,905
[SPEAKER_11]: So the winning teacher who completed the lyrics got a bus duty pass, which is worth gold.

282
02:25:10,067 --> 02:25:19,335
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is an initiative led by Mrs. Ford, who has started inviting students down to follow morning announcements with a translated version.

283
02:25:20,596 --> 02:25:21,257
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you're able to.

284
02:25:22,520 --> 02:25:24,862
[SPEAKER_11]: Go to slide 13.

285
02:25:24,902 --> 02:25:34,951
[SPEAKER_11]: You can hear in the classroom.

286
02:25:53,328 --> 02:25:59,733
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so this was an example of how we are celebrating our diverse culture at the McGlynn Elementary School.

287
02:26:00,413 --> 02:26:03,936
[SPEAKER_11]: This is one of our students who was reading the announcements in Chinese.

288
02:26:04,576 --> 02:26:09,320
[SPEAKER_11]: And prior to this, we had a third grade student read the announcements in Russian.

289
02:26:09,800 --> 02:26:13,543
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are going to be cycling through all of our languages and celebrate the diversity.

290
02:26:14,424 --> 02:26:14,584
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

291
02:26:18,322 --> 02:26:29,230
[SPEAKER_11]: We were lucky enough to celebrate Veterans Day with Medford Police Officer Pura Fori, who came by and did a presentation for our second and fifth graders.

292
02:26:41,139 --> 02:26:43,141
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so we're gonna move on.

293
02:26:43,401 --> 02:26:44,402
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no, are you able to?

294
02:26:47,426 --> 02:26:54,172
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

295
02:27:01,059 --> 02:27:09,106
[SPEAKER_11]: So this was an interactive presentation where Officer Peoria shared the value of our veterans and the kids were able to ask him questions throughout the presentation.

296
02:27:12,981 --> 02:27:18,007
[SPEAKER_11]: We are lucky enough to have a local author visit us, Fia Creed.

297
02:27:18,388 --> 02:27:20,510
[SPEAKER_11]: She gave a presentation to our entire school.

298
02:27:20,971 --> 02:27:26,478
[SPEAKER_11]: She read one of her books, Jet the Cat, and talked about her journey to becoming an author.

299
02:27:29,406 --> 02:27:33,249
[SPEAKER_11]: and this is hot off the press, our annual Thanksgiving food drive.

300
02:27:33,349 --> 02:27:40,755
[SPEAKER_11]: We set a goal to have 1,200 cans and we destroyed it by getting over 1,400 cans.

301
02:27:40,795 --> 02:27:42,637
[SPEAKER_11]: So a big shout out to Ms.

302
02:27:42,677 --> 02:27:43,617
[SPEAKER_11]: Dougherty and Ms.

303
02:27:43,737 --> 02:27:45,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Rosa for putting together.

304
02:27:45,859 --> 02:27:46,680
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, absolutely.

305
02:27:50,403 --> 02:27:55,747
[SPEAKER_11]: Creating 46 bags of food plus gift cards to donate to families in our community.

306
02:27:56,837 --> 02:27:59,658
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I'm going to wrap it up with a McGlynn gratitude tree.

307
02:27:59,678 --> 02:28:13,421
[SPEAKER_11]: This was recently put up where students and staff and family can grab a piece of construction paper and leaf a compliment or something that they're gracious for.

308
02:28:14,422 --> 02:28:15,522
[SPEAKER_11]: So that is our presentation.

309
02:28:15,562 --> 02:28:16,822
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just did want to say thank you.

310
02:28:17,242 --> 02:28:19,143
[SPEAKER_11]: And I want to wish everyone a wonderful.

311
02:28:19,588 --> 02:28:20,488
[SPEAKER_11]: Happy Thanksgiving.

312
02:28:20,748 --> 02:28:21,408
[SPEAKER_10]: Can we ask a question?

313
02:28:21,468 --> 02:28:22,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

314
02:28:22,509 --> 02:28:22,789
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

315
02:28:22,809 --> 02:28:24,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin.

316
02:28:24,909 --> 02:28:25,289
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

317
02:28:25,329 --> 02:28:26,489
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for the presentation.

318
02:28:26,509 --> 02:28:30,150
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really lovely to see everything that the students are doing.

319
02:28:30,550 --> 02:28:40,252
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just curious for folks that are watching that might not necessarily know, can you give us a little just background on the demo for the elementary school in terms of how many students just in general and how many?

320
02:28:40,432 --> 02:28:41,312
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yes.

321
02:28:41,492 --> 02:28:41,952
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

322
02:28:42,212 --> 02:28:42,753
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely.

323
02:28:42,873 --> 02:28:43,633
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have 500 kiddos.

324
02:28:45,390 --> 02:28:48,311
[SPEAKER_11]: And our demographics are as follows.

325
02:28:49,372 --> 02:28:53,734
[SPEAKER_11]: We have 11% African-American, 17% Asian.

326
02:28:54,494 --> 02:28:59,696
[SPEAKER_11]: We are 23% Hispanic, 44% white and 4% multi-race.

327
02:29:00,177 --> 02:29:01,817
[SPEAKER_11]: So we are truly the diverse school.

328
02:29:02,578 --> 02:29:04,138
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's what makes us special.

329
02:29:09,821 --> 02:29:12,362
[SPEAKER_11]: So we have for the Yale population, we have the newcomer program.

330
02:29:13,050 --> 02:29:19,355
[SPEAKER_11]: And we have a specialized special education program called Access, and that is to support the severely disabled.

331
02:29:20,856 --> 02:29:25,839
[SPEAKER_11]: And we also service kids on IEPs throughout the inclusionary settings.

332
02:29:26,560 --> 02:29:26,720
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

333
02:29:27,100 --> 02:29:28,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, you're welcome.

334
02:29:29,041 --> 02:29:30,683
[SPEAKER_09]: Any other questions for Mr. O'Brien?

335
02:29:30,703 --> 02:29:34,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, sorry about that button.

336
02:29:37,287 --> 02:29:37,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Tucci.

337
02:30:13,499 --> 02:30:14,299
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, good evening, everyone.

338
02:30:14,419 --> 02:30:15,119
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Nick Tucci.

339
02:30:15,140 --> 02:30:16,460
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the principal of the McGlynn Middle School.

340
02:30:16,900 --> 02:30:18,601
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to have on the button at all times.

341
02:30:21,892 --> 02:30:25,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy Thanksgiving to all of you and to our wonderful Medford community.

342
02:30:26,035 --> 02:30:30,858
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly a privilege to serve in the role of principal of the McGlynn Middle School on a daily basis.

343
02:30:31,238 --> 02:30:32,179
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly love my job.

344
02:30:32,299 --> 02:30:38,784
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly love interacting with the students and working with our staff members to collaborate to help to meet the needs of our student population.

345
02:30:39,744 --> 02:30:45,348
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, I'd like to just give you a little bit of an update as to what we've been up to here at the McGlynn thus far this 2023-24 school year.

346
02:30:48,376 --> 02:30:50,539
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go on to the next slide, Dr. Cushing, that'd be great.

347
02:30:50,559 --> 02:30:53,623
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight's presentation is going to be filled with fall highlights.

348
02:30:53,883 --> 02:31:06,780
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll just kind of report back on some of what's been happening at the school, as well as some student programming, some ways that we've been able to make some strong connections with family in our community in order to engage our community.

349
02:31:07,301 --> 02:31:18,056
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also provide you with an update as to some of the work that I am doing alongside my principal, Mr. John Bruneau, in order to lead the instructional work that's so important to make progress and improve student outcomes.

350
02:31:18,196 --> 02:31:22,682
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm happy to field any questions that you folks might have at the conclusion of the presentation.

351
02:31:26,380 --> 02:31:32,946
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now I'm very happy to report that students of the middle school are coming to school and coming to school on a very consistent basis.

352
02:31:33,947 --> 02:31:43,457
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently right now we're at a 96% attendance rate to start the school year, which from my perspective that was one of the goals that I had as the principal of the school this school year.

353
02:31:43,777 --> 02:31:45,338
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll speak a little bit more to that in just a moment.

354
02:31:46,059 --> 02:31:50,460
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 75% of our students are participating in the life of the school.

355
02:31:50,821 --> 02:32:01,604
[SPEAKER_00]: That means they're not only coming to school at 7.50 in the morning and clocking out at 2.15, but they're getting involved in the life of the school through clubs, sports, activities.

356
02:32:02,144 --> 02:32:03,425
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exactly what I want them to do.

357
02:32:03,525 --> 02:32:04,985
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll speak to that in just a moment too.

358
02:32:05,685 --> 02:32:10,667
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to highlight the success of a lot of our Mustang athletes, as well as our fine arts.

359
02:32:13,826 --> 02:32:15,848
[SPEAKER_00]: So first off, let me just speak to the attendance piece.

360
02:32:16,549 --> 02:32:30,463
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons why I wanted to, as a principal, have a goal of making sure my students are coming to school on a consistent basis is because this has been a problematic matter across all of Massachusetts schools and nation schools across the country ever since the pandemic.

361
02:32:31,304 --> 02:32:41,373
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that Commissioner Riley reports, it's on my slideshow here, is that this is one of the key components that we as educational leaders need to really focus on in order to improve student outcomes.

362
02:32:41,934 --> 02:32:44,156
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get the students through the doors every single day.

363
02:32:44,536 --> 02:32:53,545
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we have that captive audience, I'm really, really a big believer in the work that our teachers can do in order to fully engage our students in order to help them to get to the next level.

364
02:32:54,145 --> 02:33:10,582
[SPEAKER_00]: It also speaks the school climate and culture at the middle school to as well that our students want to come to school, they're engaging coming to school, and this way we can serve their full needs, you know from their academic needs their social emotional needs to their growth as people, and also their needs when it comes to

365
02:33:10,962 --> 02:33:17,349
[SPEAKER_00]: counseling and, you know, just making sure they get a breakfast and lunch every single school day, thanks to you as the Met for school committee as well.

366
02:33:17,890 --> 02:33:19,532
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a big focus of mine.

367
02:33:20,132 --> 02:33:25,599
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year the school came in the middle school and 94% attendance rate, which is fine, but

368
02:33:26,019 --> 02:33:41,660
[SPEAKER_00]: from my perspective, I'm really shooting towards the 96, 97 and 98% range in order to make sure our students are coming to school on time and we don't have any cases of chronic absenteeism because certainly that's very impactful to the learning and the outcomes that eventually we're going to be paying a strong attention to.

369
02:33:46,075 --> 02:33:55,808
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned before, one of the reasons that hopefully will continue to tick up our attendance rate and our student outcomes at the McGlynn Middle School is making sure that our students are being engaged in the life of our school.

370
02:33:56,369 --> 02:34:02,377
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned before, about 75%, a little over that actually, are involved in either a club sport or activity.

371
02:34:03,038 --> 02:34:14,162
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always encourage our students to say that one of the biggest things you could do to find success is to make sure you're connected to something in the school other than just your math class or your English class, for example.

372
02:34:14,462 --> 02:34:21,564
[SPEAKER_00]: We wanna make sure that they are a part of one of our over 30 clubs and activities that are shared between the McGlynn Middle School and the Andrews Middle School.

373
02:34:22,225 --> 02:34:29,287
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll speak to the collaboration between the McGlynn and the Andrews and the continued improvement in the right direction in that fashion in just a moment as well.

374
02:34:30,402 --> 02:34:47,803
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly, I'd love to highlight and I certainly appreciate the Medford community support of making sure middle school student athletes have the opportunity to participate in our full array of fall, winter and spring sports, it's great to see the Medford across their Jersey participating in the greater Boston League sports that we provide.

375
02:34:48,884 --> 02:35:06,447
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I'm really happy to bring to the McGlynn Middle School and the Andrews Middle School students is our wonderful partnership with Tufts University after school programming, where twice a week on Tuesdays and Thursdays our students have the opportunity to go to Tufts, we bus them on up there, and they participate in STEM programming, our programming, and we get them involved in tutoring too as well.

376
02:35:07,168 --> 02:35:10,091
[SPEAKER_00]: We even do virtual tutoring for students with Tufts University too as well.

377
02:35:10,671 --> 02:35:21,340
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's certainly a wonderful opportunity and myself as a parent of kids, I would certainly love to have an opportunity along those lines to send my children up to a great university and have them work and interact with the Tufts students too.

378
02:35:22,581 --> 02:35:37,610
[SPEAKER_00]: The fall season at Tufts University the fall semester is coming to a close in the next few weeks, but if anybody's interested in getting their children signed up for the spring semester, that will be will be accepting new students into that program come January of this year, the next upcoming year.

379
02:35:38,190 --> 02:35:41,712
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course we offer an array of after school support every Tuesday, Wednesday and

380
02:35:44,153 --> 02:35:46,656
[SPEAKER_00]: work with their teachers in small group sessions.

381
02:35:47,056 --> 02:35:55,147
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a lot of really important work with the students to provide some targeted feedback and support for them to help them do great work.

382
02:35:56,817 --> 02:36:15,182
[SPEAKER_00]: to get involved in the life of the school, and we wanna make sure they have a strong connection to the adults in our school community for not just academic purposes, but also when things happen in their lives, they have that connection with the teacher to be able to help them navigate the challenges of middle school.

383
02:36:19,249 --> 02:36:21,250
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to commend our sports teams.

384
02:36:21,690 --> 02:36:31,392
[SPEAKER_00]: But first, I want to make sure that I recognize the fact that the McGlynn Middle School is a unified champion school, because we've demonstrated our commitment to meaningful inclusion through unified sports.

385
02:36:32,153 --> 02:36:35,614
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly, our students have the opportunity to pursue unified basketball.

386
02:36:35,994 --> 02:36:43,476
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's wonderful to see all students participating in the wonderful unified basketball program that we'll be continuing to offer at the McGlynn Middle School.

387
02:36:44,216 --> 02:36:50,700
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to recognize the girls softball team and the girls cross-country team who took home first place in the Greater Boston League Championship this past fall.

388
02:36:51,260 --> 02:36:52,041
[SPEAKER_00]: Kudos to them.

389
02:36:52,961 --> 02:37:00,085
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some wonderful pictures from our championship athletes and the boys baseball and cross-country team excelled as well on the field.

390
02:37:00,505 --> 02:37:05,588
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm also particularly proud of their accomplishments, not only on the sporting fields, but also in the classroom too.

391
02:37:05,969 --> 02:37:08,730
[SPEAKER_00]: They're wonderful, wonderful student athletes.

392
02:37:08,830 --> 02:37:11,752
[SPEAKER_00]: The word student coming before athlete is something I really preach with the students.

393
02:37:14,858 --> 02:37:40,474
[SPEAKER_00]: fine arts programming as Dr. Vincent had mentioned before our Mustang marching band took home a fantastic first place finish in the NESPA finals this past fall just a few weeks ago and keep in mind that you know while many of these individuals are high school members of the marching band there are also several that are members of the middle school and they'll be rising up and eventually leading the marching band to future victories

394
02:37:40,925 --> 02:37:41,825
[SPEAKER_00]: in future years too.

395
02:37:42,545 --> 02:37:49,427
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an upcoming drama club performance that will be happening at the McGlynn Middle School in our auditorium on December 1st and December 2nd.

396
02:37:49,927 --> 02:37:55,669
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a production led by our middle school drama club, led by Andrews and McGlynn students.

397
02:37:56,089 --> 02:38:04,271
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't wait to attend both the band and the strings concert alongside many of you, because I know you all are wonderful supporters of the arts coming up later on in the month of December.

398
02:38:12,619 --> 02:38:13,760
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Cushing if you could go on.

399
02:38:14,140 --> 02:38:14,440
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

400
02:38:14,460 --> 02:38:19,604
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to recognize that just some examples of some initiatives that we part of the middle school to promote.

401
02:38:20,424 --> 02:38:30,451
[SPEAKER_00]: We do programming, at times through the wind block at our school when stands for what I need so a lot of students receive intervention opportunities to be able to work with their teachers to improve their

402
02:38:31,131 --> 02:38:41,015
[SPEAKER_00]: educational outcomes with their team of teachers, but we also use the wind block in order to build a strong foundation and send home a lot of important initiatives with our students at the school.

403
02:38:41,556 --> 02:38:53,321
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, to start the school year off, we had a whole week filled with start with hello, a big campaign in order to help students find connections in the school and understand the power of just simply saying hello and reaching out to new classmates.

404
02:38:53,721 --> 02:38:59,688
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure that no one's sitting alone in the cafeteria time, just making sure that we understand the power of making those strong connections.

405
02:38:59,728 --> 02:39:02,351
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is through our partnership with the Sandy Hook Challenge.

406
02:39:03,416 --> 02:39:15,079
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, another layer of the work that I as a principal work with students and teachers on is to make sure they understand what to do in the case that they see something that might be of concern.

407
02:39:15,819 --> 02:39:23,981
[SPEAKER_00]: And we teach the students of the importance of making sure they have strong adult connections and identifying who their trusted adults might be at the middle school level.

408
02:39:24,961 --> 02:39:35,669
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they see something that is of concern, maybe it's cyber bullying, bullying, or just a concern, we teach them how to frame it with their trusted adults and act as leaders.

409
02:39:36,089 --> 02:39:40,972
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've tried to build a strong culture at the school of being upstanders and not bystanders.

410
02:39:41,473 --> 02:39:45,996
[SPEAKER_00]: And I weave that into my programming and work with the students on a regular, regular basis.

411
02:39:47,157 --> 02:40:05,207
[SPEAKER_00]: We even have a tab on our school website where if a student doesn't feel like they want to report something of concern to one of our trusted adults, they can anonymously use that tip line in order to alert a person like myself as a leader or even the Medford police if there is a concern that might be related to safety.

412
02:40:06,738 --> 02:40:23,725
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other themes that particularly concerns me as a middle school principal is the really big national issue of vaping and the use of the e cigarettes with people as young as elementary and also middle school age children, where people start engaging in this type of at risk behavior at a young age.

413
02:40:24,565 --> 02:40:37,111
[SPEAKER_00]: And from my perspective as a person that likes to model a very healthy lifestyle, certainly this is a major concern to me because I see as a gateway into some other type of behaviors that would really derail some of our students' lives.

414
02:40:38,052 --> 02:40:46,016
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've made an effort in order to continue to help our students understand the pitfalls associated with engaging in that type of behavior.

415
02:40:46,036 --> 02:40:49,277
[SPEAKER_00]: So we brought in some experts to be able to present to our students.

416
02:40:49,678 --> 02:40:54,280
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we had the Massachusetts Partnerships Youth come in and speak on the topic of what are you puffing?

417
02:40:54,949 --> 02:40:59,590
[SPEAKER_00]: And I frame it to the students where I say to the students, I say, well, I want to make sure that you have the information.

418
02:40:59,630 --> 02:41:03,671
[SPEAKER_00]: So on a Friday night, you have the opportunity to make the right choice.

419
02:41:04,231 --> 02:41:05,491
[SPEAKER_00]: So we talk about choices a lot.

420
02:41:06,432 --> 02:41:13,873
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually hosted a screening of screen ages under the influence to the McGlynn Middle School community just a few weeks ago.

421
02:41:13,933 --> 02:41:20,095
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of our students watched the engaging documentary and unpacked it with their teachers to be able to have the important discussions

422
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:53,442
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Tucci, I think your microphone went off.

423
02:41:53,863 --> 02:41:58,286
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if your thumb is just getting tired or if we have another problem.

424
02:41:58,306 --> 02:41:58,667
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

425
02:41:59,547 --> 02:42:01,009
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted people to be able to hear you.

426
02:42:05,202 --> 02:42:06,644
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, enough family community engagements.

427
02:42:07,465 --> 02:42:22,745
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also spent some time this this past fall, trying to engage our school community by, you know, giving them opportunities to hear some parent workshops, I brought in several presenters, in order to help our parents be in tune with what our students are learning.

428
02:42:23,206 --> 02:42:27,827
[SPEAKER_00]: The PAVE presentation, PAVE stands for Parents Against Vaping and E-Cigarettes.

429
02:42:28,307 --> 02:42:30,727
[SPEAKER_00]: Screenagers was that documentary I just referenced.

430
02:42:31,147 --> 02:42:38,609
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also worked with the Medford Public Library to provide English classes for some of our families that are learning English as a second language.

431
02:42:39,209 --> 02:42:51,011
[SPEAKER_00]: And just wanted to highlight the work of Dr. Edward Vincent and making sure that it was recognized that that bullying presentation was fantastic just last week to be able to help us educate our entire school communities

432
02:42:51,591 --> 02:42:56,922
[SPEAKER_00]: on the challenges and how we can work together to stand up to bullying and be upstanders.

433
02:42:57,997 --> 02:43:14,688
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, we try to engage the McGlynn Middle School community through regular newsletters that both myself and my assistant principal, Mr. Bruno, send out that are filled with engaging and fun and interactive type of ways to get information to our school community.

434
02:43:15,268 --> 02:43:22,833
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also used both Twitter and Facebook on social media in order to highlight some great things and share out some pictures.

435
02:43:23,673 --> 02:43:32,479
[SPEAKER_00]: We write these talking points in order to help our school community because we deal with a lot of different students in our community and families that English isn't their first language.

436
02:43:32,499 --> 02:43:37,362
[SPEAKER_00]: So we really are to foster that two-way communication.

437
02:43:37,442 --> 02:43:39,144
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so important to have that strong partnership.

438
02:43:39,944 --> 02:43:43,206
[SPEAKER_00]: And a week or two ago, we had a coffee with the Councilors.

439
02:43:54,659 --> 02:44:13,873
[SPEAKER_00]: work of our PTO because they've been great making sure that we're doing fundraising, have school dances, and with the Andrews Middle School and inviting the Andrews and the McGlynn students to go to school dances together, to participate in the ice skating together and other types of things.

440
02:44:13,893 --> 02:44:16,915
[SPEAKER_00]: We look forward to that partnership in years to come too.

441
02:44:22,278 --> 02:44:27,800
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to just take a moment to recognize the work that I do on a regular basis with my staff.

442
02:44:29,301 --> 02:44:34,243
[SPEAKER_00]: Utilize every possible meeting.

443
02:44:35,163 --> 02:44:41,365
[SPEAKER_00]: Identify what I can leverage instructional strategies that hopefully will improve outcomes, and I believe it.

444
02:44:41,525 --> 02:44:48,828
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanna make sure that my teachers understand how to embed these strategies into their lesson plans on a regular basis and be reflective about their work too as well.

445
02:44:50,047 --> 02:44:58,112
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the more important aspects of my job, and I tease every occasional leader.

446
02:45:00,040 --> 02:45:09,787
[SPEAKER_00]: some opportunities to identify like what do as a school community in order to meet the needs of our diverse learning populations.

447
02:45:10,387 --> 02:45:16,031
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put out a few different slides up there that can help you understand a little bit of the work that we do.

448
02:45:16,051 --> 02:45:26,818
[SPEAKER_00]: And every single month, the use of a faculty meeting in order to teach these strategies, then evaluate them and give our teachers feedback is so crucial and valuable to my role as principal.

449
02:45:27,018 --> 02:45:29,880
[SPEAKER_00]: And I look forward to continuing to lead that work at the McGlynn Middle School.

450
02:45:30,760 --> 02:45:38,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Without further ado, I really appreciate your time, happy to answer any questions you might have, and happy Thanksgiving once again, and go Medford, beat Malden.

451
02:45:39,604 --> 02:45:40,465
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. Tucci.

452
02:45:44,614 --> 02:45:54,237
[SPEAKER_09]: Just from the chair, for those of you who are watching, I just wanted to say thank you to Mr. Tucci for the work that he does to bring programs like screenagers, et cetera, to the community.

453
02:45:54,397 --> 02:45:56,158
[SPEAKER_09]: I do wish they were better attended.

454
02:45:56,238 --> 02:46:02,099
[SPEAKER_09]: So maybe we need like a wine license or something for the evening to entice people to come or something.

455
02:46:02,159 --> 02:46:08,601
[SPEAKER_09]: But the unique thing about the bullying presentation is it is available online for a short period of time.

456
02:46:08,681 --> 02:46:10,362
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you missed it last week,

457
02:46:11,162 --> 02:46:15,807
[SPEAKER_09]: The superintendent's Friday update did have information about how to access that presentation.

458
02:46:15,827 --> 02:46:21,653
[SPEAKER_09]: And I found it to be really helpful just to listen to and actually made my kids listen to it too.

459
02:46:21,793 --> 02:46:23,574
[SPEAKER_09]: And they were like, why are we listening to this?

460
02:46:23,654 --> 02:46:27,058
[SPEAKER_09]: And I, so we had a nice discussion at dinner afterwards.

461
02:46:27,078 --> 02:46:29,120
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you for all of your work there.

462
02:46:29,140 --> 02:46:32,083
[SPEAKER_09]: I think member McLaughlin has a question.

463
02:46:33,278 --> 02:46:33,718
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, comment.

464
02:46:33,738 --> 02:46:35,019
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Mr. Tucci.

465
02:46:35,279 --> 02:46:39,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Always appreciate the hard work you do and the inclusive way in which you do it.

466
02:46:40,442 --> 02:46:40,822
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

467
02:46:40,963 --> 02:46:52,129
[SPEAKER_10]: And again, for the listening audience or viewing audience, can you share a little bit with us about the McGlynn demographics and sort of what other diverse populations you serve?

468
02:46:54,093 --> 02:46:55,974
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very diverse population of students.

469
02:46:56,015 --> 02:46:58,516
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about 450 students this school year.

470
02:46:59,297 --> 02:47:04,281
[SPEAKER_00]: And a significant portion of our population are students who are English language learners.

471
02:47:05,122 --> 02:47:08,084
[SPEAKER_00]: The exact percentage I think is around 15 to 20%.

472
02:47:08,584 --> 02:47:11,466
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have about 20% of students who are on IEP as well.

473
02:47:12,727 --> 02:47:16,590
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very diverse population and I love it every single day.

474
02:47:16,851 --> 02:47:18,472
[SPEAKER_00]: Students teach me new things every single day.

475
02:47:19,813 --> 02:47:20,353
[SPEAKER_00]: So just teach me.

476
02:47:25,106 --> 02:47:27,628
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really big point.

477
02:47:27,648 --> 02:47:31,610
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

478
02:47:32,951 --> 02:47:36,834
[SPEAKER_09]: Are there any other questions for Mr. Tucci before we let him get on with his evening?

479
02:47:38,475 --> 02:47:39,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you very much.

480
02:47:44,298 --> 02:47:49,622
[SPEAKER_09]: Item number three, we have a request to approve the school year 24-25 draft school calendar.

481
02:47:49,922 --> 02:47:50,923
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to table.

482
02:47:52,103 --> 02:47:54,305
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a motion to table on the floor by member Rousseau.

483
02:47:57,295 --> 02:47:57,995
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a second?

484
02:48:03,378 --> 02:48:04,379
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there an opportunity?

485
02:48:04,439 --> 02:48:07,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Are we not able to explain motion to table because it's non-debatable?

486
02:48:07,501 --> 02:48:07,941
[SPEAKER_10]: Or can we?

487
02:48:08,661 --> 02:48:09,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Just tell you that there's some mistakes.

488
02:48:10,582 --> 02:48:11,243
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

489
02:48:11,263 --> 02:48:11,843
[SPEAKER_05]: There's an error.

490
02:48:11,863 --> 02:48:13,164
[SPEAKER_09]: OK.

491
02:48:13,184 --> 02:48:13,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

492
02:48:13,884 --> 02:48:14,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh.

493
02:48:16,324 --> 02:48:22,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, there's a motion to table on the floor, which means further discussion is not allowed.

494
02:48:23,148 --> 02:48:27,671
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a motion to table by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

495
02:48:28,231 --> 02:48:31,072
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor of tabling item number three?

496
02:48:33,074 --> 02:48:33,854
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

497
02:48:34,915 --> 02:48:37,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, motion is tabled until the next meeting on 12.4.

498
02:48:40,419 --> 02:48:44,201
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, we do not have any presentations of the public tonight.

499
02:48:44,221 --> 02:48:53,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and, uh, but we do have a number of resolutions that have been put forward by, uh, by members, including a, uh, first reading of a policy.

500
02:48:53,784 --> 02:49:02,348
[SPEAKER_09]: So before we do that, I just want to reiterate what our public participation policy is pursuant to the policy BEDH public comment and presentations of the public.

501
02:49:02,808 --> 02:49:07,810
[SPEAKER_09]: Any resident in the audience may be given permission to speak once on any item on the agenda for up to three minutes.

502
02:49:08,462 --> 02:49:11,586
[SPEAKER_09]: The speaker is expected to keep their comments to the item on the agenda.

503
02:49:12,007 --> 02:49:17,354
[SPEAKER_09]: The speaker must begin their comments by providing their full name and full Medford Street address where they reside.

504
02:49:17,895 --> 02:49:22,521
[SPEAKER_09]: A welcoming, inclusive community is both a value of the school committee and an aspirational goal.

505
02:49:23,001 --> 02:49:25,825
[SPEAKER_09]: We ask for your help in achieving this goal and value your perspective.

506
02:49:26,343 --> 02:49:30,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Employees of the Medford Public Schools are exempt from the residency requirement of this policy.

507
02:49:30,485 --> 02:49:33,186
[SPEAKER_09]: The voice of our employees is welcomed on all matters before this body.

508
02:49:33,926 --> 02:49:43,931
[SPEAKER_09]: When a non-Medford resident employee is participating in public comment or submitting a presentation of the public, they will include their home address and identify themselves as an employee of Medford Public Schools.

509
02:49:45,111 --> 02:49:51,834
[SPEAKER_09]: So under continued business, we have 2023-25 offered by member Hays, member McLaughlin and member Stone.

510
02:49:52,509 --> 02:49:59,480
[SPEAKER_09]: It is the first reading of a policy which is ACA-1, non-discrimination on the basis of gender identity.

511
02:49:59,500 --> 02:50:03,546
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're going to have to bear with me because there's a lot of reading here, which I'm happy to do.

512
02:50:04,276 --> 02:50:12,024
[SPEAKER_09]: But before I start, I just want to make sure that for those of you listening and watching, this policy was presented at our last school committee meeting.

513
02:50:12,865 --> 02:50:19,411
[SPEAKER_09]: At that time, we talked about a variety of members having questions and comments about the policy.

514
02:50:20,152 --> 02:50:22,474
[SPEAKER_09]: We then subsequently held a committee of the whole.

515
02:50:23,795 --> 02:50:33,178
[SPEAKER_09]: and made substantial edits to the policy and ultimately favorably and unanimously moved this policy back to the floor.

516
02:50:33,258 --> 02:50:34,818
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's here for its first reading.

517
02:50:35,998 --> 02:50:46,561
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm gonna start reading and I do believe that we should read the entire thing in its first reading and then we will look for a motion afterwards.

518
02:50:47,799 --> 02:50:59,810
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'll start Medford public schools is committed to me committed to maintaining an educational environment and workplace for discrimination on the basis of gender identity, sex, sexual orientation or gender expression is not tolerated.

519
02:51:00,351 --> 02:51:09,499
[SPEAKER_09]: The school district does not and will not discriminate on the basis of gender identity, sex, sexual orientation or gender expression in the educational programs and activities of the public schools.

520
02:51:09,997 --> 02:51:15,302
[SPEAKER_09]: and strives to create an environment where all students and staff feel safe, welcomed, and included.

521
02:51:15,903 --> 02:51:20,868
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford Public Schools takes allegations of discrimination and harassment seriously and will respond promptly to complaints.

522
02:51:21,309 --> 02:51:31,419
[SPEAKER_09]: Where it is determined that an inappropriate conduct has occurred, Medford Public Schools will act promptly to eliminate the conduct and will impose corrective action as necessary, including disciplinary action where appropriate.

523
02:51:32,042 --> 02:51:41,064
[SPEAKER_09]: To help create a safe and supportive environment for all students, the school district will, consistent with the applicable laws and guidance, adhere to the below outlined policy.

524
02:51:41,205 --> 02:51:42,625
[SPEAKER_09]: Section one is definitions.

525
02:51:43,125 --> 02:51:49,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford Public Schools will maintain a list of definitions in support of this policy on the district website and will maintain a list of definitions.

526
02:51:50,560 --> 02:51:52,881
[SPEAKER_09]: will maintain the list of definitions on an annual basis.

527
02:51:53,841 --> 02:51:56,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Item number two, privacy, confidentiality, and student records.

528
02:51:57,623 --> 02:52:13,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Under state law, information about a student's assigned birth gender, name change for gender identity purposes, gender transition, medical or mental health treatment related to gender identity, or any other information of similar nature, regardless of its form, is part of the individual student record.

529
02:52:14,249 --> 02:52:16,370
[SPEAKER_09]: There are two hyperlinks to

530
02:52:17,997 --> 02:52:25,985
[SPEAKER_09]: the Department of Education and the Massachusetts Students Records Regulation in the body of the policy.

531
02:52:26,645 --> 02:52:35,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford Public Schools will ensure that all information in relation to students' gender identity shall be kept confidential in accordance with applicable federal, state, and local privacy laws and regulations.

532
02:52:36,135 --> 02:52:40,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Information that may reveal a student's gender identity to others will not be disclosed.

533
02:52:42,625 --> 02:53:03,224
[SPEAKER_09]: With regard to changes to the student record, unless the school is legally required to do so, student records regulation 603 CMR 23.01 states that these rights shall be the rights of the student upon, and there's four conditions, upon reaching 14 years of age or upon reaching ninth grade, whichever comes first.

534
02:53:03,988 --> 02:53:12,932
[SPEAKER_09]: Bullet number two, if a student is under the age of 14 and has not yet entered ninth grade, these rights shall belong to the student's caregivers.

535
02:53:14,193 --> 02:53:26,378
[SPEAKER_09]: Bullet number three, if a student is between 14 and 17 years of age or has entered ninth grade, both the student and his or her caregivers or either one acting alone shall exercise these rights.

536
02:53:27,832 --> 02:53:34,097
[SPEAKER_09]: Bullet number four, if a student is 18 years of age or older, he or she alone shall exercise these rights subject to the following.

537
02:53:34,537 --> 02:53:39,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Caregivers may continue to exercise rights until expressly limited by the student.

538
02:53:40,422 --> 02:53:43,184
[SPEAKER_09]: Section three, gender markers on student records.

539
02:53:44,611 --> 02:53:48,912
[SPEAKER_09]: A gender marker is the designation on school and other records that indicates a student's gender.

540
02:53:49,112 --> 02:53:58,355
[SPEAKER_09]: For transgender students, a documented gender marker, for example, male or female on a permanent record, should reflect the student's gender identity, not the student's assigned sex.

541
02:53:59,035 --> 02:54:14,360
[SPEAKER_09]: Upon request by the student, or in the case of students under the age of 14, or has not yet entered ninth grade, young students not yet able to advocate for themselves, requested by the caregivers, the school should change the gender marker on the record for transgender students.

542
02:54:15,276 --> 02:54:26,323
[SPEAKER_09]: In addition, transgender students who transition after having completed high school may ask their previous schools to amend school records or diploma or transcript that includes the student's birth name and gender.

543
02:54:26,903 --> 02:54:38,651
[SPEAKER_09]: When requested and when satisfied with the gender identity information provided, schools should amend the student's record, including reissuing a high school diploma or transcript to reflect the student's name and current name and gender.

544
02:54:39,932 --> 02:54:41,873
[SPEAKER_09]: Section four, names and pronouns.

545
02:54:42,967 --> 02:54:58,003
[SPEAKER_09]: Medford Public Schools recognizes that every student has the right to choose and be addressed by the name and pronouns that correspond to the gender identity they consistently assert while at school, regardless of the student's assigned birth gender and names that appear on the student's birth certificate.

546
02:54:58,564 --> 02:55:02,268
[SPEAKER_09]: Court orders are not required to update student records to reflect changes

547
02:55:02,768 --> 02:55:04,450
[SPEAKER_09]: in a student's name or gender markers.

548
02:55:05,051 --> 02:55:09,776
[SPEAKER_09]: According to DESE, Massachusetts law recognizes common law name changes.

549
02:55:10,497 --> 02:55:20,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Any individual may adopt a name that is different from the name that appears on his or her birth certificate provided the change of name is done for an honest reason with no fraudulent intent.

550
02:55:21,509 --> 02:55:23,651
[SPEAKER_09]: Nothing more formal than usage is required.

551
02:55:24,965 --> 02:55:25,326
[SPEAKER_09]: end quote.

552
02:55:26,206 --> 02:55:37,954
[SPEAKER_09]: Schools will work with the student and the caregivers if they are involved in the process or in the case of a younger student with the student and the student's caregivers to develop a plan for communicating any name and pronoun change within the school.

553
02:55:39,396 --> 02:55:40,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Item five, transitions.

554
02:55:41,877 --> 02:55:49,563
[SPEAKER_09]: The decision about whether or how to undergo social and or medical gender transition is personal and depends on the unique circumstances of each individual.

555
02:55:50,103 --> 02:55:54,146
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no threshold medical or mental health diagnosis or treatment requirement

556
02:55:54,520 --> 02:56:01,303
[SPEAKER_09]: that any student must meet in order to have his or her gender identity recognized and respected by a school.

557
02:56:01,363 --> 02:56:21,490
[SPEAKER_09]: When the school is informed of a student's transition, the school shall hold a meeting with the student and caregivers of the student if they're involved in the process, or in the case of a younger student, with the student and the student's caregivers to develop a transition plan to provide a safe and supportive educational environment for students and to address any concerns that may arise.

558
02:56:22,008 --> 02:56:28,192
[SPEAKER_09]: The primary goal of MPS will be to facilitate the relationship between the student and primary caregivers wherever possible.

559
02:56:28,452 --> 02:56:36,378
[SPEAKER_09]: However, some transgender and gender nonconforming students are not openly so at home for reasons such as safety concerns or lack of acceptance.

560
02:56:36,738 --> 02:56:44,643
[SPEAKER_09]: School personnel should speak with the student first before discussing a student's gender nonconformity or transgender status with the student's caregivers.

561
02:56:45,164 --> 02:56:50,307
[SPEAKER_09]: For the same reasons, school personnel should discuss with the student how the school should refer to the student

562
02:56:51,167 --> 02:56:54,710
[SPEAKER_09]: example, appropriate pronoun use and written communication to the students' caregivers.

563
02:56:56,412 --> 02:56:59,535
[SPEAKER_09]: Section six.

564
02:56:59,755 --> 02:57:03,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Last section, restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities.

565
02:57:03,879 --> 02:57:13,168
[SPEAKER_09]: All students are entitled to have access to restrooms, locker rooms, and changing facilities that are sanitary, safe, and adequate so that they can comfortably and fully engage in their school program and activities.

566
02:57:13,732 --> 02:57:19,415
[SPEAKER_09]: Students in Medford Public Schools will have access to the restroom, locker room, and changing facility that corresponds to their gender identity.

567
02:57:19,995 --> 02:57:38,263
[SPEAKER_09]: Transgender and gender nonconforming students who are uncomfortable using a sex segregated restroom, locker room, or changing facility should be provided with safe and adequate alternatives, such as private changing areas, designated gender neutral restrooms, single stall gender neutral restrooms, or a nurse's or main office restroom.

568
02:57:39,004 --> 02:57:41,945
[SPEAKER_09]: However, under no circumstances will a student be required

569
02:57:42,389 --> 02:57:46,271
[SPEAKER_09]: to use gender neutral facilities because they are transgender or non-conforming.

570
02:57:47,791 --> 02:57:53,094
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is a new policy and we've set the frequency for review to be every two years.

571
02:57:53,894 --> 02:58:04,579
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are a series of legal references that follow the policy that I am not going to read tonight because it's a bunch of hyperlinks and those are best looked at online.

572
02:58:11,255 --> 02:58:13,056
[SPEAKER_09]: questions from the committee.

573
02:58:13,416 --> 02:58:13,917
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau.

574
02:58:15,017 --> 02:58:15,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

575
02:58:15,597 --> 02:58:21,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a few small amendments I'd like to make.

576
02:58:21,220 --> 02:58:22,461
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take them one at a time.

577
02:58:25,082 --> 02:58:36,187
[SPEAKER_05]: The first is to add a new related policy, the JICA dress code policy under the related policy section.

578
02:58:36,367 --> 02:58:37,448
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my first motion.

579
02:58:40,591 --> 02:58:49,920
[SPEAKER_09]: So motion to add JICA dress code policy under the related policies in the policy information at the end of the document.

580
02:58:51,182 --> 02:58:53,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

581
02:58:54,144 --> 02:58:54,985
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

582
02:58:55,005 --> 02:58:55,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

583
02:58:56,187 --> 02:58:56,927
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

584
02:58:57,808 --> 02:58:58,409
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

585
02:58:59,175 --> 02:58:59,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

586
02:59:00,875 --> 02:59:05,316
[SPEAKER_05]: The next one is in the privacy, confidentiality, and student records section.

587
02:59:06,177 --> 02:59:13,998
[SPEAKER_05]: And my motion is to replace his, her, with their, and he, her, he, she, with they.

588
02:59:15,279 --> 02:59:18,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of amusing in this policy that we make that mistake.

589
02:59:20,400 --> 02:59:21,340
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's my motion.

590
02:59:22,100 --> 02:59:26,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to replace he, she, with their, and his, her, with their.

591
02:59:29,790 --> 02:59:34,953
[SPEAKER_09]: in section two, privacy and confidentiality of student records.

592
02:59:36,874 --> 02:59:39,635
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion by Member Ruseau, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

593
02:59:41,016 --> 02:59:41,736
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

594
02:59:41,757 --> 02:59:42,477
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

595
02:59:42,957 --> 02:59:43,658
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

596
02:59:44,658 --> 02:59:45,258
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

597
02:59:46,459 --> 02:59:48,600
[SPEAKER_05]: And two more.

598
02:59:49,521 --> 02:59:53,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Motion to replace DESE with the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.

599
02:59:53,803 --> 02:59:55,384
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't remember where it was in the poll.

600
02:59:56,224 --> 02:59:56,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Section four.

601
02:59:57,045 --> 02:59:57,385
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

602
02:59:59,517 --> 03:00:07,926
[SPEAKER_09]: So motion to spell out the acronym DESI in section four, which is names and pronouns by member Rousseau, seconded by member Hays.

603
03:00:08,026 --> 03:00:08,847
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

604
03:00:09,387 --> 03:00:09,527
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

605
03:00:09,988 --> 03:00:10,668
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

606
03:00:11,549 --> 03:00:12,210
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

607
03:00:13,271 --> 03:00:19,798
[SPEAKER_05]: And hopefully last, in the last sentence of the first paragraph,

608
03:00:23,502 --> 03:00:36,507
[SPEAKER_05]: It says, I'm sorry, yes, the last sentence of the first paragraph, it says, including disciplinary action where appropriate, and I would motion to replace that with including disciplinary action following restorative practices where necessary.

609
03:00:39,048 --> 03:00:49,252
[SPEAKER_09]: So motion to add or restorative practices before where appropriate in the introduction by member Rousseau, seconded by member McLaughlin.

610
03:00:49,272 --> 03:00:50,012
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

611
03:00:50,172 --> 03:00:51,132
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by member Hays.

612
03:00:51,212 --> 03:00:52,593
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, sorry, member Hays, sorry.

613
03:00:53,157 --> 03:00:55,439
[SPEAKER_10]: And following restorative practices, I think it said.

614
03:00:55,619 --> 03:00:55,960
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.

615
03:00:56,620 --> 03:00:58,462
[SPEAKER_10]: But members, I was writing it down, so.

616
03:00:59,323 --> 03:00:59,723
[SPEAKER_10]: Exactly.

617
03:01:00,865 --> 03:01:01,585
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

618
03:01:02,266 --> 03:01:02,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

619
03:01:03,067 --> 03:01:03,827
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

620
03:01:04,908 --> 03:01:05,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

621
03:01:05,789 --> 03:01:06,470
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

622
03:01:07,351 --> 03:01:09,633
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to approve.

623
03:01:09,873 --> 03:01:12,876
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I just, I'm sorry, before we do that, to

624
03:01:14,946 --> 03:01:17,227
[SPEAKER_09]: Two more, one more question.

625
03:01:18,247 --> 03:01:26,930
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to change his or her in section four, names and pronouns to their, by me.

626
03:01:27,951 --> 03:01:33,213
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by, motion by Vice Chair Graham, seconded by Member Hays.

627
03:01:33,233 --> 03:01:33,913
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

628
03:01:33,933 --> 03:01:34,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

629
03:01:34,973 --> 03:01:35,614
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

630
03:01:38,095 --> 03:01:38,595
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

631
03:01:41,616 --> 03:01:42,016
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Hays.

632
03:01:43,080 --> 03:01:47,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, I have a couple of, just a couple of edit issues too, or questions.

633
03:01:49,003 --> 03:01:59,908
[SPEAKER_07]: In the transition section, where it says the school shall hold a meeting, would like to change that to the school will offer to hold a meeting.

634
03:02:01,508 --> 03:02:01,909
[SPEAKER_10]: Second.

635
03:02:05,170 --> 03:02:06,811
[SPEAKER_10]: Under transition section, second.

636
03:02:08,872 --> 03:02:10,072
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, I'm just looking for it.

637
03:02:13,059 --> 03:02:29,664
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so motion to add the word offer between shall offer to between shall and hold one, two, three, four, five rows down on our paper by member Hays, seconded by member Laughlin.

638
03:02:29,804 --> 03:02:30,584
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor.

639
03:02:30,604 --> 03:02:31,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

640
03:02:31,985 --> 03:02:32,745
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed.

641
03:02:33,765 --> 03:02:34,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

642
03:02:37,567 --> 03:02:41,888
[SPEAKER_09]: Fifth, about halfway through the paragraph member Ruseau.

643
03:02:46,314 --> 03:02:48,336
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Hays, did you have another item?

644
03:02:48,436 --> 03:02:49,377
[SPEAKER_07]: Just one more.

645
03:02:50,037 --> 03:03:05,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Under gender markers on student records, I think there was, so on that the sentence upon request by the student or in the case of student under the age of 14, it's a little confusing.

646
03:03:05,229 --> 03:03:07,031
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that a couple of things got

647
03:03:08,909 --> 03:03:12,750
[SPEAKER_07]: either when I wrote it, it came out wrong, or something was changed.

648
03:03:13,270 --> 03:03:16,671
[SPEAKER_07]: But it just feels like it's a little confusing.

649
03:03:16,691 --> 03:03:26,513
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, upon request by the student, or in the case of a student under the age of 14, or has not yet entered ninth grade, then comma, young student not able to advocate for themselves.

650
03:03:27,193 --> 03:03:37,276
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it needs to be, I'm curious if others, if everyone could look at that and see if that feels like it needs to be a little reworded.

651
03:03:39,670 --> 03:03:44,912
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there maybe a motion to add comma or in the, for young students?

652
03:03:45,072 --> 03:03:48,694
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wondering, my motion was to take out to, let's see, to change it like this.

653
03:03:49,074 --> 03:04:02,099
[SPEAKER_07]: Upon request by the student, or in the case of a student who was under the age of 14 or has not yet entered ninth grade, and then take out young students not yet able to advocate for themselves.

654
03:04:03,400 --> 03:04:04,080
[SPEAKER_07]: Just take that out.

655
03:04:04,580 --> 03:04:08,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Has not yet entered the ninth grade by the caregivers.

656
03:04:09,793 --> 03:04:13,575
[SPEAKER_07]: The school should change the gender marker on the record for transgender students.

657
03:04:16,417 --> 03:04:24,481
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think we need young students not yet able to advocate for themselves since we've spelled out that by law, there's that 14 year old.

658
03:04:24,921 --> 03:04:25,641
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't change.

659
03:04:26,222 --> 03:04:35,967
[SPEAKER_07]: By law, the student record can only be changed by the parent if the student is under the age of 14 or has not yet reached ninth grade.

660
03:04:38,053 --> 03:04:43,955
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a motion to strike young students not yet able to advocate for themselves requested by the caregivers.

661
03:04:45,575 --> 03:04:46,676
[SPEAKER_10]: Can I ask a question?

662
03:04:48,276 --> 03:04:49,677
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a second before we do that?

663
03:04:51,957 --> 03:04:52,958
[SPEAKER_09]: Second by member Rousseau.

664
03:04:53,358 --> 03:04:53,978
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin?

665
03:04:56,482 --> 03:04:56,843
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

666
03:04:57,123 --> 03:05:01,786
[SPEAKER_10]: So tell me what that was intended to mean before we strike it, because I'm not clear.

667
03:05:02,266 --> 03:05:02,646
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree.

668
03:05:02,706 --> 03:05:04,487
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not clear what it was intended to mean.

669
03:05:05,088 --> 03:05:09,931
[SPEAKER_10]: So I just want to clarify to make sure we're not striking something that had some meaning.

670
03:05:09,971 --> 03:05:14,674
[SPEAKER_10]: So young students not yet able to advocate for themselves requested by the caregiver.

671
03:05:14,754 --> 03:05:15,394
[SPEAKER_10]: What does that mean?

672
03:05:16,235 --> 03:05:21,518
[SPEAKER_07]: So I believe the original wording, this is something that got changed after our committee of the whole.

673
03:05:22,473 --> 03:05:33,217
[SPEAKER_07]: The original language was directly from DESE and did not specify that 14 year age, but then we did find that the law does, for the student records, the law specifies the age.

674
03:05:33,337 --> 03:05:38,698
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that young students not yet able to advocate for themselves was part of the original DESE language.

675
03:05:38,878 --> 03:05:38,999
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

676
03:05:39,019 --> 03:05:39,639
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

677
03:05:39,719 --> 03:05:40,119
[SPEAKER_09]: I gotcha.

678
03:05:40,219 --> 03:05:40,559
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

679
03:05:42,640 --> 03:05:49,422
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a motion on the floor to strike young students not yet able to advocate for themselves requested by the caregivers.

680
03:05:50,404 --> 03:05:52,445
[SPEAKER_09]: by Member Hays, seconded by Member Ruseau.

681
03:05:52,725 --> 03:05:53,505
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

682
03:05:53,525 --> 03:05:53,585
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

683
03:05:54,846 --> 03:05:55,646
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

684
03:05:56,287 --> 03:05:56,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

685
03:06:00,129 --> 03:06:01,269
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a motion to approve.

686
03:06:02,270 --> 03:06:05,271
[SPEAKER_09]: And there's a motion to approve this policy as amended by Member McLaughlin.

687
03:06:07,152 --> 03:06:08,352
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Member Hays.

688
03:06:08,993 --> 03:06:09,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call, please.

689
03:06:19,612 --> 03:06:24,595
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have any hands on Zoom and I don't see anybody at the podium.

690
03:06:27,237 --> 03:06:27,957
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure, come on up.

691
03:06:31,439 --> 03:06:34,501
[SPEAKER_09]: You do have to hold that button and tell us your name and address for the record.

692
03:06:51,540 --> 03:06:55,362
[SPEAKER_09]: So to answer, the question was about whether 14 is the age of consent.

693
03:06:56,463 --> 03:07:00,885
[SPEAKER_09]: As it relates to changing student records, 14 is the age that is outlined.

694
03:07:01,965 --> 03:07:08,869
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't believe it's the same thing as the... Students have the right to change their record at 14.

695
03:07:09,849 --> 03:07:12,211
[SPEAKER_09]: They have the right to change everything, yeah.

696
03:07:13,011 --> 03:07:14,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Everything that is changeable, I guess I would say.

697
03:07:28,371 --> 03:07:33,316
[SPEAKER_09]: So we don't charge, to my knowledge, for restated diplomas, is that correct?

698
03:07:33,336 --> 03:07:35,077
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

699
03:08:14,343 --> 03:08:15,263
[SPEAKER_09]: There actually are.

700
03:08:16,264 --> 03:08:18,265
[SPEAKER_09]: So they can't, because that button is broken.

701
03:08:18,485 --> 03:08:18,865
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

702
03:08:20,166 --> 03:08:20,466
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

703
03:08:20,806 --> 03:08:30,810
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was wondering, has the thought process gone into girls who don't feel comfortable in these situations?

704
03:08:30,950 --> 03:08:34,132
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have a safe place or a safe way to express it?

705
03:08:50,336 --> 03:08:53,909
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Edward Vincent, can you describe what would happen in that kind of case?

706
03:08:56,027 --> 03:09:04,172
[SPEAKER_06]: So if a student were to feel uncomfortable, they could use a different single stall, a separate changing area.

707
03:09:04,252 --> 03:09:07,034
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's an option for all students.

708
03:09:07,434 --> 03:09:13,858
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they don't wanna be in a large area, they have access to smaller areas where they could change privately.

709
03:09:13,898 --> 03:09:21,643
[SPEAKER_06]: So we do have that available private spaces that students can go in and use to change if they would like to.

710
03:09:22,907 --> 03:09:38,514
[SPEAKER_09]: And the process for students who are feeling uncomfortable in any way about anything is that they should be bringing those concerns to their assistant principal at the high school or their teacher at the elementary school, middle school is probably an assistant principal type as well.

711
03:09:46,417 --> 03:09:51,319
[SPEAKER_08]: Does this get voted on or is it just something that you guys kind of write it out and we have to kind of just accept it?

712
03:09:52,465 --> 03:09:58,690
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have we have did we just take we did we just take the vote we did we did not take the vote yet so.

713
03:09:59,591 --> 03:10:09,920
[SPEAKER_09]: The process is that new policies are read twice in committee, so this is the first reading substantial changes were made in subcommittee we actually didn't have any.

714
03:10:10,589 --> 03:10:16,454
[SPEAKER_09]: input by the public at that publicly held meeting, which was, I think, on November 15th, if I'm remembering correctly.

715
03:10:18,295 --> 03:10:25,101
[SPEAKER_09]: So the first reading is tonight, and we will take a roll call vote to determine whether the first reading passes.

716
03:10:26,122 --> 03:10:33,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Then there is a second reading of the policy, but this body has the power to pass policy.

717
03:10:33,087 --> 03:10:36,110
[SPEAKER_09]: That is one of the four things explicitly that we are here to do.

718
03:10:37,388 --> 03:10:41,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, this body will make the decision about whether this policy goes into effect or not.

719
03:10:44,231 --> 03:10:47,272
[SPEAKER_08]: So if there's someone in the public that doesn't agree with this, what do you do?

720
03:10:48,093 --> 03:10:57,837
[SPEAKER_09]: I would direct them to the school principal wherever their child is so that they can have a conversation about the concerns for their own child.

721
03:10:58,097 --> 03:11:00,458
[SPEAKER_09]: And we want, again, we want

722
03:11:00,919 --> 03:11:02,480
[SPEAKER_09]: all students to feel safe and welcome.

723
03:11:02,500 --> 03:11:12,106
[SPEAKER_09]: And that includes children who are transgender, who are non-conforming, who have questions about what is happening around them.

724
03:11:12,166 --> 03:11:13,206
[SPEAKER_09]: That is always the case.

725
03:11:13,286 --> 03:11:21,051
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would strongly encourage you to bring these concerns to your building principal, and they have processes and procedures to go through.

726
03:11:22,672 --> 03:11:22,832
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

727
03:11:22,852 --> 03:11:23,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

728
03:11:23,392 --> 03:11:23,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

729
03:11:24,253 --> 03:11:24,533
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

730
03:11:27,398 --> 03:11:29,039
[SPEAKER_09]: Seeing no other questions.

731
03:11:29,720 --> 03:11:31,000
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau, roll call vote, please.

732
03:11:32,201 --> 03:11:32,721

[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn is absent.

743
03:11:46,128 --> 03:11:50,030
[SPEAKER_09]: So five in the affirmative, two absent.

744
03:11:50,870 --> 03:11:52,611
[SPEAKER_09]: The policy passes its first reading.

745
03:11:56,758 --> 03:12:01,663
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I make a motion to suspend the rules and waive the second reading?

746
03:12:02,884 --> 03:12:14,595
[SPEAKER_09]: A motion by Member Hays to suspend the rules and waive the second reading of policy ACA-1, non-discrimination on the basis of gender identity.

747
03:12:14,615 --> 03:12:16,737
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a second?

748
03:12:18,159 --> 03:12:18,479
[SPEAKER_05]: Second.

749
03:12:19,160 --> 03:12:20,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Member Ruseau.

750
03:12:21,344 --> 03:12:28,047
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a motion on the floor to suspend the rules and waive the second reading by Member Hays, seconded by Member Ruseau.

751
03:12:28,207 --> 03:12:28,987
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

752
03:12:29,007 --> 03:12:29,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Aye.

753
03:12:30,468 --> 03:12:31,208
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

754
03:12:32,129 --> 03:12:32,749
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

755
03:12:34,049 --> 03:12:41,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a motion to approve the policy now that the second reading has been waived?

756
03:12:42,113 --> 03:12:43,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to approve the policy.

757
03:12:43,453 --> 03:12:44,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Second.

[SPEAKER_09]: So five in the affirmative, two absent.

772
03:13:08,447 --> 03:13:10,488
[SPEAKER_09]: The policy passes.

773
03:13:12,995 --> 03:13:14,236
[SPEAKER_09]: number nine new business.

774
03:13:14,296 --> 03:13:16,757
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have several resolutions under new business.

775
03:13:17,297 --> 03:13:21,820
[SPEAKER_09]: The first is 2023-26 offered by member Graham and member Rousseau.

776
03:13:22,460 --> 03:13:30,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved that the superintendent will present school year 2024 and 2025 handbooks to the school committee for review and approval no later than April 1st, 2024.

777
03:13:31,164 --> 03:13:38,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it further resolved that the school committee will create an ad hoc subcommittee to establish a process and norms around annual handbook review no later than March 1st, 2024.

778
03:13:42,429 --> 03:13:47,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Superintendent, I wanted to, before we take a vote, I wanted to check in with you about that timing.

779
03:13:47,873 --> 03:13:54,477
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know there's a whole series of activity that happens at the school level to get handbooks ready.

780
03:13:54,577 --> 03:14:06,145
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just wanted to first ask you whether that timing is consistent with all the work that has to happen within the schools, or if you would request any sort of change to that timeline.

781
03:14:08,826 --> 03:14:12,891
[SPEAKER_06]: I think with April of 24 deadline.

782
03:14:15,354 --> 03:14:22,783
[SPEAKER_06]: The exception I would possibly ask if I were to push it to me first would be if additional policies were added.

783
03:14:23,263 --> 03:14:24,885
[SPEAKER_06]: So case in point this year.

784
03:14:26,407 --> 03:14:31,350
[SPEAKER_06]: the committee met during the summer and we had a policy that was approved in August.

785
03:14:31,890 --> 03:14:44,018
[SPEAKER_06]: So because it was approved in August, this April 1 deadline, if the handbook had been finalized, we would be doing either addendums or reprinting and doing it over again.

786
03:14:44,759 --> 03:14:48,161
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we were to maintain that April 1 date,

787
03:14:49,782 --> 03:15:06,886
[SPEAKER_06]: then we would need to make sure that policy subcommittee meetings that would need to be added into the handbook happened prior to April 1 so that we wouldn't be doing work two and three times over, just making one revision.

788
03:15:10,047 --> 03:15:16,572
[SPEAKER_06]: If we think we're able to maintain that by April of April 1st of every year, then I think that's reasonable.

789
03:15:17,132 --> 03:15:32,704
[SPEAKER_06]: But if we think we might need the month of April and make May be the cutoff so that we could have the handbooks finalized and ready to go for the start of the school year in August, then that would be my one consideration to the committee.

790
03:15:34,685 --> 03:15:35,126
[SPEAKER_07]: Member Hays.

791
03:15:36,833 --> 03:15:57,041
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just wondering since, you know, since it's difficult to, as a committee will be difficult to not to actually cut off new policies, is there a way we could create a process for if there are additional policies after the deadline for the student handbooks?

792
03:15:57,541 --> 03:16:05,104
[SPEAKER_07]: I know like the bullying policy, which I think for many reasons was put directly on the webpage, but could there be a tab somewhere or a

793
03:16:05,754 --> 03:16:19,461
[SPEAKER_07]: link somewhere that says here the policies that were passed after the deadline for that the handbook so that we have the deadline but we also have the possibility if needed to add additional policies past that deadline.

794
03:16:21,142 --> 03:16:21,882
[SPEAKER_10]: Member McLaughlin.

795
03:16:23,015 --> 03:16:23,435
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

796
03:16:23,896 --> 03:16:27,278
[SPEAKER_10]: This podium has, we've got to do something about this moving forward.

797
03:16:27,298 --> 03:16:28,679
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, I'm constantly like here.

798
03:16:28,699 --> 03:16:29,820
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a long time to stand up.

799
03:16:29,860 --> 03:16:31,501
[SPEAKER_09]: So I understand why.

800
03:16:32,182 --> 03:16:34,824
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm curious if the podium moves, but we'll figure that out later.

801
03:16:35,464 --> 03:16:47,253
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so, uh, I would think that the ad hoc committee would obviously be dealing with ways to address policy that changes between the first print and the print for the following year.

802
03:16:47,913 --> 03:16:49,294
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that's okay.

803
03:16:49,334 --> 03:16:51,396
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do think that in the given year,

804
03:16:52,541 --> 03:16:59,085
[SPEAKER_10]: If we could put it to May 1st, it does make more sense because then we do have April for any policies that sort of change.

805
03:16:59,226 --> 03:17:15,096
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm assuming that this would be, obviously we can change policy at any point, but if we're talking about sort of a consistent policy and try to building up a routine and protocol, I think it makes sense more for the May 1st so that we can get in as many of the policies that we change throughout

806
03:17:15,831 --> 03:17:29,256
[SPEAKER_10]: potentially the school year before the handbook is printed for that year, with the understanding that clearly there will be additional policies passed between May 1 and May 1 of each year, and that we can create a process through the ad hoc committee.

807
03:17:29,276 --> 03:17:31,616
[SPEAKER_10]: But I would advocate for the May 1.

808
03:17:31,656 --> 03:17:34,778
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Rossell.

809
03:17:35,578 --> 03:17:36,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

810
03:17:37,999 --> 03:17:44,481
[SPEAKER_05]: My thinking on this is that if we're passing a policy after a deadline,

811
03:17:45,336 --> 03:17:51,277
[SPEAKER_05]: that we simply set the date for when it becomes effective, because I'm not really interested in having all of this.

812
03:17:51,617 --> 03:17:55,438
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's the principals aren't running around changing these, the site councils are.

813
03:17:56,778 --> 03:18:09,801
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't think it's reasonable for us to, a week before or a week after site councils have submitted their proposed changes for us to be just making changes to policy.

814
03:18:10,161 --> 03:18:14,422
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously we can make changes to policy at any time, but I think that when our policy changes,

815
03:18:15,071 --> 03:18:22,557
[SPEAKER_05]: are going to affect the handbook, we should just consider whether or not, can this just wait another year?

816
03:18:23,118 --> 03:18:24,759
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not like if we wait another year,

817
03:18:26,161 --> 03:18:31,623
[SPEAKER_05]: There's, you know, for the most part, those kinds of things are not the end of the world.

818
03:18:31,643 --> 03:18:37,765
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the bullying policy was an example that's very, very different because it was so substantial.

819
03:18:37,905 --> 03:18:39,665
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is a great example of what we just did.

820
03:18:40,906 --> 03:18:47,628
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of the policy changes we're making are not things that if they waited another year to be in a handbook that anybody would even,

821
03:18:49,693 --> 03:18:51,034
[SPEAKER_05]: be bent out of shape about.

822
03:18:51,854 --> 03:18:57,997
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not so much concerned about the cost of printing, although, you know, money's tight.

823
03:18:58,857 --> 03:19:01,218
[SPEAKER_05]: But I am concerned about the work of the site councils.

824
03:19:02,539 --> 03:19:06,741
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's also an important thing about the handbook, though.

825
03:19:06,821 --> 03:19:08,762
[SPEAKER_05]: There are sections of the handbook that are

826
03:19:09,142 --> 03:19:11,284
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of inherited from the district.

827
03:19:11,945 --> 03:19:14,187
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the same in every single handbook.

828
03:19:14,727 --> 03:19:20,132
[SPEAKER_05]: Site councils don't even really have a say in them, things such as things that come from the law.

829
03:19:21,393 --> 03:19:27,959
[SPEAKER_05]: So whether or not the change would affect site council work, I think is something to be considered.

830
03:19:27,999 --> 03:19:29,301
[SPEAKER_05]: And I certainly think that

831
03:19:30,880 --> 03:19:32,743
[SPEAKER_05]: As a chair of the policy subcommittee.

832
03:19:34,365 --> 03:19:35,948
[SPEAKER_05]: This is not something I had thought through.

833
03:19:36,148 --> 03:19:41,376
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that is something to consider in our procedures around policy adoption to be like

834
03:19:42,230 --> 03:19:45,111
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, sort of a checkbox, does this affect handbooks?

835
03:19:45,191 --> 03:19:48,411
[SPEAKER_05]: And if so, when should it go into effect?

836
03:19:48,532 --> 03:20:00,274
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's an easy thing to consider rather than setting some arbitrary date, because a lot of times policies come up because something's happening and we can't wait.

837
03:20:01,335 --> 03:20:06,736
[SPEAKER_05]: So knowing the impact of the change, I think, is something we can just put right into our procedures.

838
03:20:08,192 --> 03:20:09,052
[SPEAKER_09]: Dr. Edward-Vinson?

839
03:20:09,553 --> 03:20:36,623
[SPEAKER_06]: So with the March 1st, 2024 deadline, where the committee wants to be able to review revisions, my ask would be of the committee from March 1st to April 1st, that gives 30 days to essentially review the entire handbook and make sure like, if anything else is gonna be, is that enough time for the committee?

840
03:20:37,659 --> 03:20:47,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, the March 1st deadline was just to really, I think, do some thinking through the process and norms around handbook review, because we've not done that as a district for a really long time.

841
03:20:47,764 --> 03:20:53,027
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think these are the good kind of questions that probably need some consideration.

842
03:20:53,067 --> 03:21:01,292
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the intent of the March 1st deadline was that our ad hoc committee process will be completed and we'll have some answers about these kinds of things.

843
03:21:02,392 --> 03:21:07,155
[SPEAKER_09]: But then by May 1st, I think as amended, we would need you

844
03:21:07,896 --> 03:21:15,459
[SPEAKER_09]: we would need you to provide all the handbooks to us so that we can then do that review starting on May 1st and in time for the next school year.

845
03:21:15,519 --> 03:21:24,542
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think that ad hoc process to establish like the process and norms is where some of these like finer details can be worked out.

846
03:21:25,443 --> 03:21:30,885
[SPEAKER_09]: But also I'm in favor of a May 1st date for you to turn over the handbooks to us for review.

847
03:21:30,945 --> 03:21:32,225
[SPEAKER_09]: That's totally fine with me.

848
03:21:32,345 --> 03:21:36,367
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would make a motion as amended and seconded by member McLaughlin.

849
03:21:38,056 --> 03:21:38,856
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

850
03:21:39,917 --> 03:21:40,637
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

851
03:21:41,498 --> 03:21:45,901
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

852
03:21:45,921 --> 03:21:49,003
[SPEAKER_09]: 2023-27 offered by member Hays, member McLaughlin, and member Mustone.

853
03:21:49,224 --> 03:21:51,605
[SPEAKER_09]: Ad hoc report request on the bullying curriculum.

854
03:21:52,226 --> 03:21:58,971
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas the Medford Public Schools bullying and intervention plan states that NPS will provide age appropriate instruction on bullying prevention to students as required by law.

855
03:22:00,083 --> 03:22:10,812
[SPEAKER_09]: be it resolved that MPS administration will provide a presentation to update the community about the curriculum and lessons used at each grade level to explicitly teach students the following.

856
03:22:11,513 --> 03:22:14,355
[SPEAKER_09]: Number one, how to understand what bullying looks like and sounds like.

857
03:22:14,775 --> 03:22:17,197
[SPEAKER_09]: Number two, how to identify bullying when it's happening.

858
03:22:17,337 --> 03:22:22,021
[SPEAKER_09]: And number three, how to understand when verbal bullying becomes hate speech.

859
03:22:23,242 --> 03:22:26,085
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Hays or Member McLaughlin, would you like to speak on this?

860
03:22:27,419 --> 03:22:28,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I can start.

861
03:22:28,379 --> 03:22:47,627
[SPEAKER_07]: So in looking through both the bullying policy and looking just through our webpage, what I realized in looking at everything related to bullying is we do have a lot of descriptions of some of the, I guess, more of the prevention.

862
03:22:47,787 --> 03:22:55,750
[SPEAKER_07]: We have responsive classroom, which gets a lot at building community, social emotional skills, emotional regulation.

863
03:22:56,800 --> 03:23:02,805
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the Nexus classroom, we have, I'm trying to think, there's a number of things that we have.

864
03:23:03,285 --> 03:23:04,846
[SPEAKER_07]: I couldn't find anywhere, sorry?

865
03:23:05,867 --> 03:23:06,988
[SPEAKER_07]: Just say hello.

866
03:23:07,528 --> 03:23:15,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, just say hello and Sandy Hook, yes, the Sandy Hook, which more gets at when you're looking at someone who's really in an emotional crisis and what do you do about that?

867
03:23:17,875 --> 03:23:24,060
[SPEAKER_07]: But I didn't see anywhere that explained clearly for parents in the community and us,

868
03:23:25,305 --> 03:23:35,191
[SPEAKER_07]: where we have in our curriculum explicit, like it says in here, explicit instruction for students, sorry, about how to identify bullying.

869
03:23:36,112 --> 03:23:51,221
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's gonna be developmentally different at every age, of course, but really, I think we need to clearly understand what are we teaching kids so that they know what bullying looks like, what it looks like, what it sounds like,

870
03:23:52,631 --> 03:24:07,720
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, that idea of, you know, we did have a parent who wrote to us a while back about their student, their child in school, talking about how kids were, how language was evolving at the middle school level.

871
03:24:07,780 --> 03:24:15,905
[SPEAKER_07]: And there were words being used that sounded benign, but were being used very much in a hate speech manner.

872
03:24:16,845 --> 03:24:17,806
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that

873
03:24:18,424 --> 03:24:27,511
[SPEAKER_07]: there's a lot of kids who don't understand that and might hear it and might not identify that as bullying or then identify it as hate speech.

874
03:24:27,931 --> 03:24:40,181
[SPEAKER_07]: So kind of all of this explicit teaching of what bullying is so that kids know what to identify when we're saying, you know, call us or tell us or find your trusted adult.

875
03:24:41,081 --> 03:24:47,086
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not sure that we have anything that tells us how we're teaching kids what they are bringing to the adult.

876
03:24:48,442 --> 03:24:49,123
[SPEAKER_09]: Member McLaughlin.

877
03:24:50,704 --> 03:24:51,144
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

878
03:24:51,344 --> 03:24:52,405
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Member Hays.

879
03:24:52,965 --> 03:25:16,023
[SPEAKER_10]: I also wanted to request an amendment just sort of in a lot of the thought process that was occurring tonight for me anyway, and has been for a while, is I would like something to be included here around differentiated curriculum for students with disabilities and English learners so that when we're talking about the curriculum, we're also talking about it being differentiated for all students.

880
03:25:18,012 --> 03:25:20,573
[SPEAKER_10]: if you'd be willing to accept that, that would be lovely.

881
03:25:20,713 --> 03:25:21,833
[SPEAKER_05]: I need language that.

882
03:25:22,813 --> 03:25:23,053
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

883
03:25:23,093 --> 03:25:23,553
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm ready.

884
03:25:23,573 --> 03:25:25,513
[SPEAKER_10]: Go slowly.

885
03:25:25,794 --> 03:25:26,014
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

886
03:25:26,754 --> 03:25:27,074
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

887
03:25:27,354 --> 03:25:32,035
[SPEAKER_10]: So resolve the MPS administration will provide a not an presentation.

888
03:25:32,055 --> 03:25:43,077
[SPEAKER_10]: So the current, um, proposal to update the community about the curriculum or lessons and then different common differentiated

889
03:25:45,472 --> 03:26:02,039
[SPEAKER_10]: for students with disabilities and English learners, as well as all students, that is used at each grade level to explicitly teach students the following.

890
03:26:17,872 --> 03:26:19,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Ruseau, just let us know when you're ready.

891
03:26:19,573 --> 03:26:19,993
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I'm ready.

892
03:26:20,133 --> 03:26:20,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry.

893
03:26:20,653 --> 03:26:21,594
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

894
03:26:21,674 --> 03:26:26,176
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's a motion to approve as amended by Member Hays.

895
03:26:26,396 --> 03:26:27,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded by Member McLaughlin.

896
03:26:28,297 --> 03:26:29,158
[SPEAKER_09]: All those in favor?

897
03:26:30,818 --> 03:26:31,499
[SPEAKER_09]: All those opposed?

898
03:26:33,140 --> 03:26:36,381
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion passes.

899
03:26:36,401 --> 03:26:41,464
[SPEAKER_09]: 2023-28 offered by Member Hays, Member McLaughlin, and Member Mustone.

900
03:26:41,957 --> 03:26:45,700
[SPEAKER_09]: Accessibility of End of Cycle Superintendent Summative Evaluation Report.

901
03:26:46,160 --> 03:26:54,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas the Medford School Committee is committed to ensuring transparency, accountability and accessibility to the community with regard to the work of the school committee and the school administration.

902
03:26:55,126 --> 03:26:59,789
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas the completion of the annual superintendent is one of the three main functions of the school committee.

903
03:27:00,390 --> 03:27:11,297
[SPEAKER_09]: Whereas the Superintendent End of Cycle Summative Evaluation Report is a public document that provides the community with important documentation of the superintendent's performance and the district's progress towards the goals

904
03:27:11,769 --> 03:27:12,810
[SPEAKER_09]: in the strategic plan.

905
03:27:13,210 --> 03:27:26,639
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it resolved, each superintendent end of cycle summative evaluation report from the 2021-2022 school year forward will be added to the newly created superintendent evaluation tab on the school committee page of the Medford Public Schools website.

906
03:27:27,220 --> 03:27:36,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it further resolved, each new summative evaluation report will be added to the superintendent evaluation tab of the Medford Public Schools website within two weeks of approval by the school committee.

907
03:27:37,386 --> 03:27:41,069
[SPEAKER_09]: Be it further resolved, every summative evaluation report will be translated

908
03:27:41,556 --> 03:27:45,397
[SPEAKER_09]: into the top three languages spoken by families in the Medford Public Schools.

909
03:27:46,557 --> 03:27:47,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Member Hays.

910
03:27:48,938 --> 03:27:49,398
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

911
03:27:50,058 --> 03:27:58,901
[SPEAKER_07]: We do currently now have a tab on our MPS website that does have this past year's superintendent evaluation.

912
03:27:59,722 --> 03:28:06,726
[SPEAKER_07]: So this motion, this resolution really is just to continue that.

913
03:28:07,366 --> 03:28:18,152
[SPEAKER_07]: I did put in 21-22, which would be the previous year's evaluation, which I opened up to the committee to decide whether they want to include that in this.

914
03:28:19,072 --> 03:28:21,534
[SPEAKER_07]: I just put that in because that was my first year on the committee.

915
03:28:22,614 --> 03:28:26,937
[SPEAKER_07]: But I think it's important that we make these evaluation reports

916
03:28:27,901 --> 03:28:30,782
[SPEAKER_07]: more easily accessible than they have been in the past.

917
03:28:31,262 --> 03:28:54,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, as it says in the motion, these reports are not only about the performance of the superintendent, but because the superintendent is the chief executive of the school system, they're also an indication, one indication of how the school system as a whole is doing and how our goals are tied to our strategic plan.

918
03:28:54,809 --> 03:28:56,450
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a measure of how

919
03:28:56,892 --> 03:28:58,933
[SPEAKER_07]: we're meeting the goals in our strategic plan.

920
03:29:00,294 --> 03:29:05,177
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is just a motion to make an already public document more easily accessible to the public.

921
03:29:07,238 --> 03:29:11,221
[SPEAKER_09]: Motion to approve by Member Hays, seconded by Member McLaughlin.

922
03:29:11,381 --> 03:29:12,001
[SPEAKER_09]: Roll call, please.

[SPEAKER_05]: Mayor Lungo-Koehn is absent.

934
03:29:30,182 --> 03:29:34,385
[SPEAKER_09]: Two in the affirmative, three in the negative, two absent, the motion fails.

935
03:29:36,126 --> 03:29:40,649
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have any reports requested this evening, but we do have a number of condolences.

936
03:29:41,770 --> 03:29:53,137
[SPEAKER_09]: The members of the Medford School Committee expressed their sincerest condolences to Patrice Berry, Medford High School teacher, and her family for the loss of their daughter, Lauren Berry of Malden, and also Medford High graduate of 2007.

937
03:29:54,824 --> 03:30:13,292

03:30:32,788 --> 03:30:41,252
[SPEAKER_09]: And members of the Medford School Committee expressed their sincerest condolences to the family of Patricia Kenna, former Medford public school teacher.

941
03:30:41,732 --> 03:30:43,713

942
03:30:57,551 --> 03:30:57,751

03:30:58,932 --> 03:31:06,278
