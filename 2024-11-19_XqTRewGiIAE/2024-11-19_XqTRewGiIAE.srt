[SPEAKER_02]: To our existing billboard before us this evening it was tabled for a couple weeks and I'm hoping we can pick that matter up.

00:01:15,568 --> 00:01:17,009
[SPEAKER_11]: It's a paper to one.

[SPEAKER_11]: I think I see you know I'm out of here you know.

00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:42,710
[SPEAKER_12]: I was the president carry all members of the council on if I may can I share my screen.

[SPEAKER_11]: So you should be all set.

48
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Perfect.

49
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:08,981
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you guys see?

50
00:02:11,262 --> 00:02:11,742
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, we can.

51
00:02:11,762 --> 00:02:13,463
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

52
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:16,518
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

53
00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:17,038
[SPEAKER_12]: Good evening.

54
00:02:17,118 --> 00:02:26,260
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is John Omar with clear channel outdoor and we have a project going on at 2.36 to 2.40 mystic Avenue.

55
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,421
[SPEAKER_12]: Mister Ron Roberto which I think he is present in the crowd tonight.

56
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:37,722
[SPEAKER_12]: We have been a tenant here for Mister Roberto for just over 16 years.

57
00:02:39,002 --> 00:02:40,502
[SPEAKER_12]: And he had approached us recently.

58
00:02:40,522 --> 00:02:45,063
[SPEAKER_12]: Over the past couple years is having an issue.

59
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:48,449
[SPEAKER_12]: with his parking lot with the weather coming in the snow.

60
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,912
[SPEAKER_12]: He's not getting proper drainage for his tenant.

61
00:02:54,832 --> 00:03:14,463
[SPEAKER_12]: So he had come to us to see if there's anything we could do with the sign to move in to help him out as the drainage isn't really isn't really working out for him and you'd like to see if he could you know if he can fix his own and we could possibly move the sign.

62
00:03:15,213 --> 00:03:19,236
[SPEAKER_12]: So he had asked us to move the sign 15 feet to the south of the property.

63
00:03:20,497 --> 00:03:32,326
[SPEAKER_12]: Hopefully that will allow him to fix his parking lot to alleviate you know the drainage issues improve snow removal and improve parking for his her rental car tenant.

64
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:44,315
[SPEAKER_12]: We would like to proceed to see if we can move this sign and convert

65
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:52,624
[SPEAKER_12]: upgrade the site to digital which we do have 2 of the signs within the city north and south of the billboard.

66
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:59,668
[SPEAKER_12]: As prior agreements we have we give the city 7 hours of public service messaging per month on each face.

67
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,331
[SPEAKER_12]: 15 hours of public service and mask on which they receive.

68
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:11,376
[SPEAKER_12]: The city would get 25,000 per year linkage fee for the life of the lease.

69
00:04:12,088 --> 00:04:16,449
[SPEAKER_12]: So however long the lease is there, the city will get $25,000 per year.

70
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,611
[SPEAKER_12]: The sign does go dark from 11 p.m.

71
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:26,813
[SPEAKER_12]: to 5 a.m., so as people are aware, the signs do just completely shut off, turn back on at 5 a.m.

72
00:04:28,213 --> 00:04:35,996
[SPEAKER_12]: And then if we are approved by council tonight, we'll enter into another development agreement with the city of Medford with the above terms.

73
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,217
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the past,

74
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:49,888
[SPEAKER_12]: You know these billboards they can be used for public service announcements whether amber alerts FBI bulletins emergency response programs.

75
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,751
[SPEAKER_12]: In the city does take advantage.

76
00:04:54,413 --> 00:05:01,501
[SPEAKER_12]: The public service advertising in the past is what's been advertised on these billboards for the city.

77
00:05:13,524 --> 00:05:21,112
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have basically seeking permission to move the sign 15 feet salt and convert this to a digital.

78
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:22,914
[SPEAKER_12]: Upgraded to digital.

79
00:05:26,017 --> 00:05:27,519
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a night.

80
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,321
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very familiar with this parcel of land.

81
00:05:31,341 --> 00:05:36,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very familiar with the billboard agreement that the city has with clear channel.

82
00:05:36,485 --> 00:05:40,489
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something that's negotiated by the city council the terms of the agreement of the terms of the agreement.

83
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:51,617
[SPEAKER_02]: I think really the issue that's before us this evening is whether or not we're going to reverse the sign denial because of the denial that was issued by the building commissioner because it falls out of the scope of our sign ordinance.

84
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,851
[SPEAKER_02]: This billboard has always fallen outside the scope of our signed ordinance because it was part of a program that was negotiated with the state.

85
00:05:59,912 --> 00:06:09,134
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to allow the property owner to get the necessary relief that he needs to make his parcel more accessible and more developable, I think it makes sense for us to approve this measure this evening, Mr. President.

86
00:06:09,694 --> 00:06:18,997
[SPEAKER_02]: The way that I look at this is we're addressing an environmental concern relative to the runoff and leakage and drainage problems that we have at the gentleman's parcel, and we're also getting upgrades

87
00:06:19,957 --> 00:06:22,398
[SPEAKER_02]: to the existing billboard to make it more environmentally friendly.

88
00:06:23,118 --> 00:06:25,759
[SPEAKER_02]: The transfer, it's going to help us out with light pollution and the like.

89
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,461
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that this is a measure, Mr. President, that's a win-win for all.

90
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:32,622
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows the property owner to get the necessary relief that he needs.

91
00:06:32,702 --> 00:06:44,626
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows Clear Channel the opportunity to upgrade their existing equipment, and it allows us here in the city of Medford to have some of the best, state-of-the-art, most up-to-date equipment to utilize through public service programs that they have.

92
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:49,568
[SPEAKER_02]: So I, for one, certainly feel as though this is a measure that the council should be approving, and I will move for approval.

93
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:52,682
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

94
00:06:53,563 --> 00:06:53,803
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

95
00:06:53,823 --> 00:06:55,664
[SPEAKER_14]: Mister president, I just have a few questions.

96
00:06:56,906 --> 00:07:05,092
[SPEAKER_14]: So the plan is that the sign would move 15 feet and then the property owner would do whatever additional work they need to do to improve drainage.

97
00:07:05,112 --> 00:07:06,634
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys are simply just moving the sign.

98
00:07:06,654 --> 00:07:07,775
[SPEAKER_14]: You're not doing anything else.

99
00:07:08,736 --> 00:07:17,503
[SPEAKER_12]: No, we're just moving the sign and the property owner can handle the drainage himself and do what he has to do to the city and get the necessary permits to do so.

100
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:19,985
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, thank you.

101
00:07:20,045 --> 00:07:25,167
[SPEAKER_14]: And vice president, I just alluded that, um, the illumination would be different.

102
00:07:25,187 --> 00:07:30,668
[SPEAKER_14]: It would actually be lower and less disruptive with the led, the digital billboard, as opposed to the current illuminated one.

103
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,569
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you, is that correct?

104
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:34,870
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, that is correct.

105
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,651
[SPEAKER_12]: So the electronic billboards are monitored by the state.

106
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,091
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I believe that measured in NITS.

107
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:48,634
[SPEAKER_12]: So the state does monitor the brightness of, um, the billboards and with new technology today, um, if the signs are too bright,

108
00:07:49,348 --> 00:08:01,117
[SPEAKER_12]: They have a sensor in it that automatically brings them back down to the proper brightness.

109
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,921
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you know how close this is to the other digital billboard?

110
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:07,743
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

111
00:08:07,783 --> 00:08:10,044
[SPEAKER_12]: The other digital billboard, it should be well over 1,100 feet.

112
00:08:10,064 --> 00:08:10,104
[SPEAKER_12]: OK.

113
00:08:10,144 --> 00:08:11,085
[SPEAKER_12]: So relatively close.

114
00:08:19,102 --> 00:08:20,162
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, that's all I have right now.

115
00:08:20,202 --> 00:08:21,723
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

116
00:08:23,263 --> 00:08:24,264
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

117
00:08:24,724 --> 00:08:43,270
[SPEAKER_13]: And, um, just for a little bit of, uh, background on this, I actually sat on the council when there was a pushback some 16, 17 years ago, uh, to consolidate the number of billboards that existed throughout the community.

118
00:08:44,427 --> 00:08:48,910
[SPEAKER_13]: and many of which abutted neighborhoods, uh, as we all are aware.

119
00:08:49,551 --> 00:09:00,099
[SPEAKER_13]: And the push back then was to kind of centrally focus, uh, the billboards along 93 and take them out of the neighborhood areas.

120
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:08,285
[SPEAKER_13]: And I believe the agreement that was passed some years ago was very successful in taking out some of that blight in our neighborhoods.

121
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:21,728
[SPEAKER_13]: And at the time, residents were very happy with the agreement that was struck by then Mayor McGlynn and some of the big billboard advertising companies at the time.

122
00:09:23,609 --> 00:09:27,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Ron Roberto has been in this community for a hundred years.

123
00:09:28,955 --> 00:09:34,637
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you're not that old, Ron, but he's been an establishment in this community for 100 years, Mr. President.

124
00:09:34,957 --> 00:09:37,218
[SPEAKER_13]: He's been a tremendous business owner.

125
00:09:38,018 --> 00:09:51,142
[SPEAKER_13]: He's been a tremendous advocate for social service programs in our community and someone that I look up to, Mr. President, as a business leader in our community.

126
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:53,923
[SPEAKER_13]: So I just want that to be known, Mr. President.

127
00:09:54,303 --> 00:10:02,610
[SPEAKER_13]: The question I had to Mr. Yano, he mentioned the $25,000 in linkage and seven hours of public service messages.

128
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:08,674
[SPEAKER_13]: I was just wondering, does that differ from the current agreement that is in place now?

129
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:15,700
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, we went into another separate agreement, another agreement with the town.

130
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:17,993
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

131
00:10:18,013 --> 00:10:24,117
[SPEAKER_13]: So, so, uh, can you state what the original agreement is and when does that, was that a 20 year agreement?

132
00:10:24,197 --> 00:10:24,997
[SPEAKER_13]: And when does that end?

133
00:10:26,298 --> 00:10:28,760
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, so basically it's, it's the life of the lease.

134
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:34,363
[SPEAKER_12]: So currently we'll have, we have a 25 year extension on the Bilbo lease with Mr. Roberto.

135
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:38,425
[SPEAKER_12]: So for at least another 25 years, it's 25 K each year.

136
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:44,569
[SPEAKER_12]: So the current lease was for how long with Mr. Roberto?

137
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:45,830
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

138
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:50,142
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that expires in five years.

139
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,345
[SPEAKER_13]: So that expires in five years.

140
00:10:54,385 --> 00:11:00,530
[SPEAKER_13]: So when you talk about the $25,000 linkage, is it just for this sign or is it for other signs included?

141
00:11:01,631 --> 00:11:02,552
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just for this sign.

142
00:11:02,952 --> 00:11:06,275
[SPEAKER_12]: The other signs are already included in a development agreement with the city.

143
00:11:07,316 --> 00:11:07,516
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

144
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:15,983
[SPEAKER_13]: So the seven hours of public service is in addition to hours that are being done right now.

145
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:16,879
[SPEAKER_12]: Correct.

146
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,622
[SPEAKER_12]: In addition, in another 25 K on top of the other agreement.

147
00:11:21,543 --> 00:11:21,663
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

148
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:28,809
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you able to tell us how many public service hours have been messaged on that board since its inception?

149
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:37,796
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have that off the top of my head, but, um, you know, in prior slides that I did show, let me see if I can show these again.

150
00:11:38,637 --> 00:11:41,759
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I mean, it does look like the city does take advantage of it.

151
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,163
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, here's at least six, I'd say probably within the last,

152
00:11:46,877 --> 00:11:49,159
[SPEAKER_12]: you know 6 months.

153
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,324
[SPEAKER_12]: And then here's another another 6 that were used.

154
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:54,785
[SPEAKER_12]: So the city does.

155
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:58,209
[SPEAKER_12]: You know take advantage of the usage.

156
00:12:00,523 --> 00:12:10,927
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Clerk, Mr. President, as part of this report, I would ask that we receive an update on the public service messages that are going out by the city.

157
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:27,112
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to make sure if they're allotting, it's a very expensive endeavor if anyone ever put something up on a billboard, and I want to make sure that we're using it to benefit our local civic groups as well as our sports teams and any other messaging, Mr. President.

158
00:12:27,132 --> 00:12:29,753
[SPEAKER_13]: So I want to make sure that we're taking full advantage of that.

159
00:12:30,213 --> 00:12:35,276
[SPEAKER_13]: I have, as my colleague stated, I have no problem upgrading to a digital board.

160
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:40,918
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, that's the wave of technology, and it's the latest and greatest.

161
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:56,026
[SPEAKER_13]: The illuminants are less than what's out there now, so that's always been a concern with the Butters and neighborhood, and the fact that it's gonna be shut off after, did you say 11, Mr. Yano?

162
00:12:56,406 --> 00:12:57,527
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, they go dark from 11 to 5 a.m.

163
00:12:59,763 --> 00:13:00,483
[SPEAKER_13]: 11 to 5 a.m.

164
00:13:00,784 --> 00:13:08,806
[SPEAKER_13]: The city does not pay for a nickel of the electricity that's paid by the property owner, and we get $25,000 in linkage.

165
00:13:08,826 --> 00:13:12,528
[SPEAKER_13]: So to me, this is a win-win, Mr. President, and I will support it tonight.

166
00:13:12,548 --> 00:13:12,868
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

167
00:13:12,988 --> 00:13:14,128
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

168
00:13:14,388 --> 00:13:15,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

169
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:17,710
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank Yano for the presentation.

170
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,650
[SPEAKER_09]: Yano, could you show us slide number four again?

171
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,551
[SPEAKER_12]: Sure.

172
00:13:20,571 --> 00:13:20,671
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

173
00:13:23,632 --> 00:13:24,972
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you see it?

174
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:27,273
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

175
00:13:30,658 --> 00:13:33,139
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was the slide with all the community benefits.

176
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:34,580
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to look at that one more time.

177
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,761
[SPEAKER_09]: I missed the last one, I think.

178
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:41,784
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you need to reshare your screen, because we're not seeing anything.

179
00:13:41,804 --> 00:13:42,304
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, one second.

180
00:13:49,648 --> 00:13:50,148
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

181
00:13:51,469 --> 00:13:52,049
[SPEAKER_12]: Can you see that?

182
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,750
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

183
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:08,846
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, point that was the, uh, bullet number.

184
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:09,767
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to five.

185
00:14:09,787 --> 00:14:12,287
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get cut off at the end and sure.

186
00:14:12,307 --> 00:14:13,467
[SPEAKER_09]: Make sure I can see the whole thing.

187
00:14:14,668 --> 00:14:15,768
[SPEAKER_09]: If you want to read it, that's fine.

188
00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:18,929
[SPEAKER_12]: Bulletproof bullet point five.

189
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:25,050
[SPEAKER_12]: If approved by city council, CCO will enter into another development agreement with the city of Medford with the above terms.

190
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:26,690
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

191
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:27,310
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

192
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,851
[SPEAKER_09]: That's all I wanted to see.

193
00:14:28,971 --> 00:14:29,671
[SPEAKER_09]: Perfect.

194
00:14:29,691 --> 00:14:30,391

[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

254
00:18:41,212 --> 00:18:42,193
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

255
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:43,953
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank my colleagues.

256
00:18:44,013 --> 00:18:50,675
[SPEAKER_13]: This has been a long arduous process over the last year and a half.

257
00:18:52,295 --> 00:18:58,297
[SPEAKER_13]: Countless meetings, hundreds of hours, Mr. President, meetings, the hiring of a consultant.

258
00:18:59,797 --> 00:19:04,198
[SPEAKER_13]: And I believe what we have now is a good working document.

259
00:19:04,923 --> 00:19:08,686
[SPEAKER_13]: One in which requires additional stakeholder input.

260
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:17,793
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and that is going to take place over a period of time with the offices of the community development board, as well as what this method city council.

261
00:19:18,193 --> 00:19:21,396
[SPEAKER_13]: So there's much room for discussion and change.

262
00:19:21,796 --> 00:19:25,639
[SPEAKER_13]: This was a starter document that we put together.

263
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:30,863
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, it hasn't been looked at in probably 30 something years, the zoning in our community.

264
00:19:30,923 --> 00:19:31,043
[SPEAKER_13]: So,

265
00:19:31,483 --> 00:19:32,404
[SPEAKER_13]: It was long overdue.

266
00:19:32,844 --> 00:19:43,572
[SPEAKER_13]: The one request I would have, Mr. President, and I've had a number of residents reach out to me asking me to summarize the major changes, um, in this particular document.

267
00:19:44,072 --> 00:19:47,214
[SPEAKER_13]: And I know we have a red line, the blue line copy.

268
00:19:47,935 --> 00:19:56,141
[SPEAKER_13]: And, uh, unless you've been working with this document, uh, for the past year and a half, um, to me, it's zoning is pretty complex.

269
00:19:56,701 --> 00:20:01,323
[SPEAKER_13]: I think it's one of the most complex issues that I've had to deal with at my tenure on the council.

270
00:20:02,064 --> 00:20:14,549
[SPEAKER_13]: And at this point, I would ask that if we go back to our consultant and see if he can put together a brief summary of the major changes.

271
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:23,053
[SPEAKER_13]: There was a lot of technical changes, and I don't think at this point the technical changes we have to summarize, but the major changes

272
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:40,508
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, that, uh, you know, and I, and I guess that's open for interpretation, but the major changes to this, Mr. President, if he could put together just a brief summary, so residents can look at it rather than going through a hundred page document, uh, look at it and say, okay, this is impacted.

273
00:20:40,528 --> 00:20:41,268
[SPEAKER_13]: That's impacted.

274
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:42,028
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree.

275
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:42,709
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't agree.

276
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:44,289
[SPEAKER_13]: I should research this further.

277
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:45,990
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't need to research it further.

278
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,410
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and at least,

279
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,192
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, give them a starting point.

280
00:20:50,972 --> 00:20:57,336
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, you know, we've all sat through hundreds of hours meetings, uh, and most residents haven't had that opportunity.

281
00:20:57,876 --> 00:21:02,800
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, no, what I say, they should, uh, you know, uh, have been that involved.

282
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,860
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why they elect us.

283
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:09,644
[SPEAKER_13]: But, uh, it's important that, uh, they have a thumbnail cursory of what transpired

284
00:21:10,344 --> 00:21:13,266
[SPEAKER_13]: through this work of this council over the last year and a half.

285
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:21,592
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would respectfully ask that be part of Council Vice President Knight's paper to move this forward to the community development.

286
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:22,853
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

287
00:21:22,913 --> 00:21:24,054
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

288
00:21:25,355 --> 00:21:26,636
[SPEAKER_03]: If I could further amend that.

289
00:21:26,816 --> 00:21:27,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.

290
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:30,799
[SPEAKER_03]: You can go ahead.

291
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:33,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

292
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:34,242
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just go really quickly.

293
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:40,083
[SPEAKER_03]: If we could post the red line copy online, as well as the summary when we get it.

294
00:21:40,183 --> 00:21:41,964
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, I'm totally in agreement with you.

295
00:21:42,084 --> 00:21:45,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we might've asked Mr. Brodsky to do that at the committee of the whole meeting.

296
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,428
[SPEAKER_03]: So it should be, maybe it's to be done more quickly.

297
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:51,790
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm hoping that both of those can be posted online.

298
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,210
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.

299
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:52,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

300
00:21:53,131 --> 00:21:53,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

301
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:55,895
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

302
00:21:56,335 --> 00:22:03,017
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to thank Councilor Marks for his words and just echo what he said in that this moving to the Community Development Board is just another step in the feedback process.

303
00:22:03,477 --> 00:22:08,538
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a lot of time for more stakeholder input, citizen resident input.

304
00:22:08,638 --> 00:22:10,079
[SPEAKER_14]: This isn't us rubber stamping it.

305
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:12,959
[SPEAKER_14]: This is us just moving into the next process of engagement.

306
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:14,180
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just want to make that clear.

307
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:14,720
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

308
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,000

[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

310
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:21,145
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to thank all my colleagues for all their help with this.

311
00:22:21,446 --> 00:22:23,327
[SPEAKER_09]: This actually has been a long process.

312
00:22:24,268 --> 00:22:28,653
[SPEAKER_09]: Like Councilor Marksley mentioned, at least a year and a half that we've gone through this year.

313
00:22:28,673 --> 00:22:30,715
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of meetings, great team effort.

314
00:22:30,775 --> 00:22:33,338
[SPEAKER_09]: We're not done, but this is a major

315
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:38,593
[SPEAKER_09]: major piece of the process, passing it on to the CD board.

316
00:22:38,814 --> 00:22:52,236
[SPEAKER_09]: And I believe Mark Obrosky is working on that document, which is definitely something that will benefit everyone that wants to look at the changes that we made.

317
00:22:52,296 --> 00:22:59,757
[SPEAKER_09]: But this has been a great team effort, and I look to definitely work towards a finished product.

318
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:04,758
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to be better for it in the end, and well worth the time and effort that we've put into it.

319
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:05,318
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you.

320
00:23:06,555 --> 00:23:06,815
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

321
00:23:06,835 --> 00:23:10,177
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, uh, this was a, this was a long process.

322
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:22,144
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and again, I, I, I'm, uh, very happy that we, uh, I had, uh, Mr. Burkowski, he's probably the foremost authority on zoning in the, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

323
00:23:22,224 --> 00:23:26,066
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, he will be presenting this, uh, to the OCD board.

324
00:23:26,647 --> 00:23:32,450
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd like to, um, hopefully with, uh, after this is done, I'd like to have him come back and actually help

325
00:23:33,923 --> 00:23:35,845
[SPEAKER_11]: with the actual zoning of the city.

326
00:23:36,365 --> 00:23:40,048
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, his expertise is really second to none.

327
00:23:40,608 --> 00:23:48,895
[SPEAKER_11]: So I say, after this is done, we can have a discussion on this, but I'd like to have him come back and help out further.

328
00:23:50,816 --> 00:24:00,984
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Bears, and amended by Councilor Marks.

342
00:25:27,937 --> 00:25:36,679

396
00:28:13,885 --> 00:28:20,989
[SPEAKER_02]: As we're all aware, if we've been paying attention to what's going on in this community, as of recent, the issue of 5G technology was certainly a concern.

397
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:21,329
[SPEAKER_10]: Skip one.

398
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:22,510
[SPEAKER_10]: Skip one.

399
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:25,552
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was 0 Goley Road.

[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

[SPEAKER_02]: We can jump back to it.

405
00:28:34,605 --> 00:28:38,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, why don't we get council Scarpelli's items out of the way.

406
00:28:38,827 --> 00:28:42,568
[SPEAKER_11]: Is that a long time?

407
00:28:43,248 --> 00:28:50,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, Mr. President, the issue of 5g facilities in this community has been a topic of discussion and concern.

408
00:28:50,411 --> 00:28:52,072
[SPEAKER_02]: There are many individuals in this community.

409
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:56,390
[SPEAKER_02]: that have expressed some concern about 5G technology and the placement thereof.

410
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:07,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Recently, the city's ad hoc small cell committee has approved 17 5G towers to be located in the city of Medford.

411
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:21,238
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to be sure that the residents that are going to be abutting these 5G towers are notified of the circumstance that the approval has been awarded and whether or not there are any appeals processes for these abutters should they wish to pursue them.

412
00:29:21,878 --> 00:29:24,281
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the resolution in a nutshell, Mr. President.

413
00:29:24,901 --> 00:29:28,125
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by?

432
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:00,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

433
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:09,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Mister president again this is something that before weeks ago so I appreciate bringing forward again this evening but I was probably one of them.

434
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:16,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Most phone calls I've been receiving this from my constituents about the rat problems we're having and

435
00:30:17,912 --> 00:30:36,031
[SPEAKER_01]: I can understand the plan with the city moving forward with the health department, but I think we really need to move forward more aggressive, more detailed plan, and bringing in some professionals that really see this rodent infestation or rat infestation as being

436
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:39,473
[SPEAKER_01]: what they do best.

437
00:30:39,553 --> 00:30:52,235
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that especially what's going on with the pandemic and what other issues our health department has, I don't think we're really putting enough time to really attack this problem before it even gets worse.

438
00:30:52,295 --> 00:31:05,258
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know just recently Channel 4 and 5 had Melrose's issues and we had so many different other neighboring communities that are going through the same situation, but I just don't want to

439
00:31:06,618 --> 00:31:13,665
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, get so far behind with this, this concern that we're going to be, we're going to be really in trouble.

440
00:31:13,725 --> 00:31:25,677
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I've asked is the city administration, the health department, um, is really work together and try to put together and invite, um, you know, uh, professionals, both the,

441
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:40,343
[SPEAKER_01]: the academia level and maybe contacting our neighbors and see what we can do as a collaboration, especially when we abut some of these cities that are having such a horrific time with this.

442
00:31:40,383 --> 00:31:42,044
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is an issue.

443
00:31:42,204 --> 00:31:49,946
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I went to five different homes prior to my little hiatus and

444
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:55,361
[SPEAKER_01]: The barrels have been eaten through, you see nests.

445
00:31:55,422 --> 00:32:06,770
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that council's put forth some changes hoping to allow private entities to, public entities to enter private

446
00:32:07,446 --> 00:32:10,647
[SPEAKER_01]: private homes, so we're hoping we can do more.

447
00:32:10,767 --> 00:32:25,833
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, really reach out to the city administrator and put together a working group that will attack this and its necessity as it's been called on.

448
00:32:25,873 --> 00:32:26,434
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.

449
00:32:28,494 --> 00:32:29,435
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor Caput.

450
00:32:31,006 --> 00:32:31,666
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

451
00:32:31,947 --> 00:32:32,707
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

452
00:32:32,727 --> 00:32:35,027
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward.

453
00:32:35,648 --> 00:32:43,570
[SPEAKER_09]: I've received numerous calls from various neighborhoods throughout the city, and it's consistent.

454
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:49,611
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I've received calls from Wellington, North Medford, South Medford.

455
00:32:50,992 --> 00:32:53,333
[SPEAKER_09]: One person even called me and literally FaceTimed

456
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:56,795
[SPEAKER_09]: the rats that were in his backyard.

457
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,959
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a real problem.

458
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,260
[SPEAKER_09]: It needs to be addressed.

459
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:10,348
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that it's been going on for a while, but I would ask, Mr. President, if you could please schedule a committee to hold a meeting with the health department.

460
00:33:10,368 --> 00:33:15,172
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to see exactly what they're doing to address this situation.

461
00:33:16,513 --> 00:33:18,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they baiting the sewers?

462
00:33:18,335 --> 00:33:19,557
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they not baiting the sewers?

463
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,481
[SPEAKER_09]: If they are, what sewers are they baiting?

464
00:33:23,521 --> 00:33:24,742
[SPEAKER_09]: What neighborhoods are they baiting?

465
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:27,885
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a concern that is throughout the city.

466
00:33:29,067 --> 00:33:30,008
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I said, it doesn't matter.

467
00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:33,571
[SPEAKER_09]: Various neighborhoods and it needs to be addressed.

468
00:33:34,232 --> 00:33:38,597
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would ask you to, if you would please schedule a committee to the whole meeting with

469
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:44,521
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, uh, health department to, um, get some answers with regards to some of those questions.

470
00:33:45,241 --> 00:33:45,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, please.

471
00:33:45,722 --> 00:33:48,844
[SPEAKER_09]: If I could amend that councilor Scarpelli's resolution as amended by council.

472
00:33:48,964 --> 00:33:49,304
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

473
00:33:51,105 --> 00:33:51,946
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

474
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:54,087
[SPEAKER_14]: I think councilor Scarpelli for bringing this forward.

475
00:33:54,127 --> 00:33:55,929
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think we saw the same news story.

476
00:33:55,969 --> 00:34:02,033
[SPEAKER_14]: So I was going to suggest the amendment that the administration either, um, work with,

477
00:34:02,546 --> 00:34:07,829
[SPEAKER_14]: surrounding cities or encourage representation from surrounding cities because this again, this is a regional problem.

478
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:09,130
[SPEAKER_14]: This isn't just a Medford problem.

479
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:14,854
[SPEAKER_14]: This is every city around us is facing the same issue and the rats don't know where the city border ends.

480
00:34:14,974 --> 00:34:20,857
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think just working collaboratively with those other cities that are affected, which as far as I can tell is everyone.

481
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:28,482
[SPEAKER_14]: So just amending to add that they invite representatives from surrounding communities to this working group if they can attend.

482
00:34:30,215 --> 00:34:32,917
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you adding it as an amendment also?

483
00:34:34,498 --> 00:34:36,279
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Councilor.

484
00:34:36,299 --> 00:34:36,759
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Marks.

485
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:38,540
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

486
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,781
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank Councilor Scarpelli for putting this on.

487
00:34:43,283 --> 00:34:49,526
[SPEAKER_13]: I can date this back to probably at least five or six years ago in the Dexter Street area.

488
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:53,549
[SPEAKER_13]: We were getting a number of complaints back then for rats.

489
00:34:54,549 --> 00:34:58,672
[SPEAKER_13]: The problem has shifted up to the heights around Carr Park.

490
00:34:59,572 --> 00:35:01,994
[SPEAKER_13]: to Wellington and the Haines Square area.

491
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:05,017
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm getting a ton of complaints, Mr. President.

492
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:15,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Just tonight, coming to the meeting, you know how it gets dark early, I put my car lights on in the driveway, and a good-sized rat walked by the garage door.

493
00:35:15,971 --> 00:35:18,014
[SPEAKER_13]: um, and Wellington that was in my own driveway.

494
00:35:18,714 --> 00:35:21,918
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, you know, this is becoming a public health crisis.

495
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:35,092
[SPEAKER_13]: And in my discussions with the city recently, as of within the last week, because I've been asking about the baiting as councilor Falco mentioned, I was told by a city employee, they no longer bait

496
00:35:35,713 --> 00:35:37,495
[SPEAKER_13]: the catch basins in the community.

497
00:35:38,315 --> 00:35:44,401
[SPEAKER_13]: They do not use that as a process for controlling pest control in this community.

498
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:46,303
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not sure what the process is.

499
00:35:46,863 --> 00:35:53,610
[SPEAKER_13]: I can tell you firsthand, when you call and say there's a problem with rats, the city comes out and they give you a leaflet.

500
00:35:55,138 --> 00:35:57,239
[SPEAKER_13]: And they leaflet all the doors in the neighborhood.

501
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:59,260
[SPEAKER_13]: And they'll tell you, don't leave food out.

502
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,780
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't put your barrels out too early.

503
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,381
[SPEAKER_13]: Don't leave a water source.

504
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:09,144
[SPEAKER_13]: If you're giving the birds water or squirrels, don't leave that out because rats are going to look for the water source.

505
00:36:10,644 --> 00:36:15,786
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, if you're growing vegetables outside, make sure you have them contained and not a food source.

506
00:36:16,747 --> 00:36:19,108
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot of, you know,

507
00:36:19,968 --> 00:36:26,931
[SPEAKER_13]: things residents can do, Mr. President, but I don't believe the city has acted enough on behalf of its residents.

508
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:32,633
[SPEAKER_13]: And I've stated this in the past, and I need to be critical, Mr. President, because yes, this is a problem.

509
00:36:32,933 --> 00:36:38,855
[SPEAKER_13]: I read an article recently in the Town Online that said how it's a not sure problem.

510
00:36:39,355 --> 00:36:43,457
[SPEAKER_13]: But yes, it's a problem in other communities, but we're not doing enough.

511
00:36:43,897 --> 00:36:45,477
[SPEAKER_13]: And I brought this up during budget.

512
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:55,081
[SPEAKER_13]: I believe, and I don't have the number in front of me, it was in between $10,000 to $15,000 that we spend citywide for pest control.

513
00:36:56,302 --> 00:37:03,826
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone that's called someone to do pest control, they'll come out your house, it's $300, $400 a whack to do an extermination around one home.

514
00:37:04,566 --> 00:37:14,672
[SPEAKER_13]: Here we have seven square miles with 15,000 homes, and we're spending $10,000 to $15,000 on pest control, and we have a rat problem.

515
00:37:15,952 --> 00:37:18,293
[SPEAKER_13]: It just doesn't make sense, Mr. President.

516
00:37:18,913 --> 00:37:20,994
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't believe the city's taking it seriously.

517
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:24,615
[SPEAKER_13]: And I agree with Councilor Falco and Councilor Scarpelli.

518
00:37:25,195 --> 00:37:31,998
[SPEAKER_13]: We need to call for a meeting, Mr. President, pretty quickly to find out what the Board of Health's doing regarding this.

519
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:38,520
[SPEAKER_13]: We're bringing in as contractors, because clearly we don't have the bandwidth or the capacity

520
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,041
[SPEAKER_13]: to handle it internally.

521
00:37:40,481 --> 00:37:59,435
[SPEAKER_13]: And secondly, Mr. President, as I stated before, and I'm not sure if the city's working on it or not, this council voted unanimously, uh, as part of, uh, the, uh, ordinance that we put together was to, uh, allow for a document that residents can sign that would release the city of Medford from any liability.

522
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:05,300
[SPEAKER_13]: If the city of Medford saw that they had, uh, you know, rat colonies on their property,

523
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:21,376
[SPEAKER_13]: and the resident was unable to afford it, or it was a non-owner occupied residency, that they could sign a form and have the city come in, because this is a public health crisis, no different than COVID.

524
00:38:22,096 --> 00:38:26,060
[SPEAKER_13]: If there's a large nest of one property, that affects everyone on the street.

525
00:38:26,941 --> 00:38:34,263
[SPEAKER_13]: And I believe it's the responsibility of the community as well as the city to step in, Mr. President, where need be.

526
00:38:34,843 --> 00:38:36,524
[SPEAKER_13]: And we're at that point right now.

527
00:38:36,624 --> 00:38:46,707
[SPEAKER_13]: So I would ask if the as an amendment to if the city administration has created that waiver form, I believe last I heard from the Board of Health, they were working on it.

528
00:38:48,007 --> 00:39:03,315
[SPEAKER_13]: But if they create a waiver form that would allow residents to free the city from liability and assist residents in the containment and the control of pests in this community, i.e.

529
00:39:03,395 --> 00:39:04,356
[SPEAKER_13]: rats, Mr. President.

530
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:04,736
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

531
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:05,957
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

532
00:39:07,398 --> 00:39:16,782
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, and like I said, I, I've been getting calls from people at the hillside, uh, up there and, uh, and you know, within a lot, a lot of it's coming from, uh, as Councilor Marks mentioned, people feeding the birds.

533
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:21,504
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, the bird feeders are, uh, seem to be a big, a big problem, big part of it also.

534
00:39:22,345 --> 00:39:34,070
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, so, uh, the motion by Councilor Scarpelli is amended by Councilor Falco, is amended by Councilor Morell and Councilor Marks has also amended it.

535
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:39,756
[SPEAKER_11]: seconded by second, seconded by vice president.

536
00:39:40,136 --> 00:39:41,437
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

537
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:46,480

[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

541
00:39:48,201 --> 00:39:48,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

542
00:39:49,442 --> 00:39:49,842
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

543
00:39:50,202 --> 00:39:50,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

544
00:39:58,177 --> 00:39:58,918
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

545
00:39:58,978 --> 00:40:01,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President, motion to suspend the rules to take paper 21-5-5-1.

546
00:40:02,841 --> 00:40:07,866
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Councilor Bears, suspend the rules to take paper, which one?

547
00:40:08,627 --> 00:40:12,691
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the communications from city officers.

548
00:40:12,971 --> 00:40:15,473
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, 2-1-5-5-1, seconded by Vice President Knife.

549
00:40:15,774 --> 00:40:16,875
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

550
00:40:27,232 --> 00:40:27,332
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

551
00:40:27,352 --> 00:40:27,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

552
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:28,074
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

553
00:40:28,675 --> 00:40:28,936
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

554
00:40:29,016 --> 00:40:29,216
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

555
00:40:29,397 --> 00:40:29,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

556
00:40:39,715 --> 00:40:46,496
[SPEAKER_11]: Communications with city offices employees 21551 to President Caraviello and members of the Medford City Council.

557
00:40:46,976 --> 00:41:06,580
[SPEAKER_11]: We respectfully request that you're all on board to approve one of the three re-presenting maps presented during the last two Committee of the Whole meetings of September 28th, 2021 and October 5th, 2021 after you consider the October 5th Committee of the Whole report.

558
00:41:07,696 --> 00:41:21,880
[SPEAKER_11]: full plans for redistricting are available for view in the city clerk's office and online at drivegoogle.com, backslash file D20.

559
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:28,983
[SPEAKER_11]: I think if you call the clerk, it'd be a lot easier than we're trying to read these off.

560
00:41:30,143 --> 00:41:33,244
[SPEAKER_11]: So, um, um,

561
00:41:34,365 --> 00:41:37,067
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we have to do the committee report first, correct?

562
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:37,868
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine with me.

563
00:41:38,808 --> 00:41:39,469
[SPEAKER_03]: While we're under suspension.

564
00:41:39,489 --> 00:41:41,430
[SPEAKER_11]: Before we do that, we have to re-report this out to the committee.

565
00:41:42,151 --> 00:41:49,816
[SPEAKER_11]: So, we can have a motion to take the reports of committees first.

566
00:41:50,116 --> 00:41:50,557
[SPEAKER_11]: So moved.

567
00:41:51,297 --> 00:41:59,183
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Councilor Bears, seconded by Councilor Falco to accept the report of the committee meeting 21551 on October 5th, 2021.

568
00:42:04,591 --> 00:42:06,232
[SPEAKER_11]: seconded by Councilor Knight.

569
00:42:08,453 --> 00:42:09,534

[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

576
00:42:23,923 --> 00:42:25,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Six in the affirmative, one absent.

577
00:42:25,644 --> 00:42:29,407
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes to report the paper favorably.

578
00:42:29,427 --> 00:42:30,788
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

579
00:42:30,808 --> 00:42:30,928
[SPEAKER_11]: So

580
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,121
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening, guys.

581
00:42:34,161 --> 00:42:35,162
[SPEAKER_00]: Name and address of the record, please.

582
00:42:35,442 --> 00:42:35,962
[SPEAKER_00]: Good evening.

583
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:40,206
[SPEAKER_00]: Sandra Gale, Acting Election Coordinator, 85 George P. Houset Drive.

584
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:48,373
[SPEAKER_11]: Give a brief presentation on what you'd like to do today.

585
00:42:49,819 --> 00:43:00,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, so as all the councilors know, over the last two weeks, we've presented initially two maps, and then we added an additional one last week.

586
00:43:01,028 --> 00:43:13,718
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have plan A, plan B, and plan C. I think we covered all of the sort of glitches that we may find with any of the three maps.

587
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:18,082
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the one thing that was left out, and it was brought to my attention by

588
00:43:18,686 --> 00:43:29,790
[SPEAKER_00]: the clerk last week was that there is going to be an impact based on whatever map you choose to the voter.

589
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:40,334
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you choose plan A, the voter impact of moving to a different precinct is low.

590
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,495
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan B is a little higher.

591
00:43:44,556 --> 00:43:47,597
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan C is gonna cover probably at least

592
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,551
[SPEAKER_00]: 50% of the city, I believe, Mr. Clark, is what we said.

593
00:43:51,571 --> 00:43:54,555
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be, it would be at least a third of the city.

594
00:43:54,675 --> 00:43:55,376
[SPEAKER_00]: At least a third.

595
00:43:55,436 --> 00:43:58,260
[SPEAKER_06]: We would be taking 16 precincts and going to 24 precincts.

596
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,664
[SPEAKER_06]: So it would be at least a third, it could be higher than that.

597
00:44:03,077 --> 00:44:15,259
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as you mentioned, that is what information vice president night, I do believe that would give us the capacity, though, to see growth of city population upwards of 38,000 people over the next 10 years without having to worry about having to do this again.

598
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,160
[SPEAKER_02]: So it seems like an option.

599
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,821
[SPEAKER_02]: See, you know, in fact, the voter had to be moved this time.

600
00:44:23,381 --> 00:44:31,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it's done, it's done because we've been able to address the future population growth to such an extent capacity.

601
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:32,683
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see it having to change again.

602
00:44:33,964 --> 00:44:37,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President, that is indeed one of the benefits of Plan C, but I believe Ms.

603
00:44:37,786 --> 00:44:41,088
[SPEAKER_06]: Gale was talking about one of the potential adverse impacts.

604
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:43,730
[SPEAKER_06]: But you are correct, that is one of the benefits.

605
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:55,057
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan B is also probably the most immediate solution.

606
00:44:56,138 --> 00:44:58,760
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there would be impact in the Wellington area.

607
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:10,523
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you look at where the exponential growth for the city of Medford has come from, in the last seven to nine years, it has been the Wellington area.

608
00:45:11,544 --> 00:45:19,693
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Wellington area is one of the areas where we were very top heavy in regards to not meeting that 4,000

609
00:45:21,548 --> 00:45:25,491
[SPEAKER_00]: residents, and that's what we have to remember.

610
00:45:25,571 --> 00:45:33,156
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different terms and things that we use, but it's 4,000 residents per precinct, plus or minus 5%.

611
00:45:34,837 --> 00:45:45,044
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to eliminate that and allow us for the growth for the pending 40Bs, as I stated early on in the packet,

612
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:51,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Plan B would be the way that would address that.

613
00:45:51,863 --> 00:46:16,549
[SPEAKER_00]: I also understand the council's position where you want to have the least amount of change, and that could leave you back at Plan A. Plan A still would impact the city with some change as far as boundaries are concerned, but not as much change if you went with Plan A. So if anyone has any questions,

614
00:46:17,842 --> 00:46:18,382
[SPEAKER_13]: Questions from Ms.

615
00:46:18,422 --> 00:46:18,683
[SPEAKER_13]: Gale?

616
00:46:19,523 --> 00:46:20,104
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President?

617
00:46:20,584 --> 00:46:21,105
[SPEAKER_13]: Council Box?

618
00:46:22,225 --> 00:46:23,727
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks again, Senator.

619
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:25,368
[SPEAKER_13]: I appreciate all your time and effort on this.

620
00:46:26,929 --> 00:46:42,361
[SPEAKER_13]: So, with Plan A, will we be able to address some of the concerns that were raised by this council regarding someone that may live up the heights and have to go down to the Roberts School to vote and not the Firefighters Club?

621
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:45,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Will we be able to address some of those issues within Plan A?

622
00:46:45,563 --> 00:46:45,724
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

623
00:46:46,184 --> 00:46:46,524
[SPEAKER_13]: We won't?

624
00:46:46,905 --> 00:46:46,985
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

625
00:46:47,895 --> 00:46:56,141
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only thing that plan A does for you is it shifts the boundary lines, a couple of streets, or maybe a block.

626
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:56,462
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

627
00:46:56,482 --> 00:46:56,762
[SPEAKER_03]: Gale?

628
00:46:57,042 --> 00:46:57,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

629
00:46:57,582 --> 00:47:00,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I think actually plan A is nine words and plan B is eight words.

630
00:47:00,825 --> 00:47:04,067
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we've just been, we've been referring to them.

631
00:47:04,968 --> 00:47:05,629
[SPEAKER_00]: Incorrectly?

632
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:06,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

633
00:47:09,271 --> 00:47:11,793
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have plan A. Am I wrong?

634
00:47:13,695 --> 00:47:13,975
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

635
00:47:13,995 --> 00:47:14,275
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

636
00:47:14,335 --> 00:47:14,996
[SPEAKER_03]: My apologies.

637
00:47:21,912 --> 00:47:27,453
[SPEAKER_00]: So plan A, the one, is that the one, Councilor Martins, are you asking?

638
00:47:27,493 --> 00:47:29,913
[SPEAKER_13]: Plan A is really no change at all, right?

639
00:47:29,993 --> 00:47:35,814
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it changes a couple of streets, plus or minus, but it's not a huge change.

640
00:47:37,255 --> 00:47:38,335
[SPEAKER_13]: Right, right, correct.

641
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,715
[SPEAKER_13]: I just want to make sure we're all on the same page, that's the way I understand it.

642
00:47:40,735 --> 00:47:42,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry about that, my apologies.

643
00:47:42,936 --> 00:47:46,756
[SPEAKER_13]: So plan A wouldn't address some of the concerns that this council has had.

644
00:47:46,776 --> 00:47:50,777
[SPEAKER_13]: I know Councilor Falco mentioned it and I mentioned it at the last meeting,

645
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:58,411
[SPEAKER_13]: with addressing some of the concerns of residents saying, why can't I vote at this precinct across the street from my house and I have to drive three miles?

646
00:48:00,392 --> 00:48:02,333
[SPEAKER_13]: So, we can't address it with that.

647
00:48:02,614 --> 00:48:12,218
[SPEAKER_13]: Potentially, we could address that with a plan B that creates the additional ward in the Wellington area and shift areas based on that?

648
00:48:12,518 --> 00:48:12,738
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

649
00:48:14,299 --> 00:48:17,621
[SPEAKER_00]: It addresses some, but it doesn't address all.

650
00:48:17,881 --> 00:48:18,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

651
00:48:21,179 --> 00:48:43,257
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also addresses the abutment of numbers so that we get correct with, if 11 starts here at say three o'clock, we're gonna move the hands of the clock and go this way and say one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, so that we are counterclockwise correct with what our ward numbers are.

652
00:48:44,739 --> 00:48:46,560
[SPEAKER_00]: So that addresses that as well.

653
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, thank you.

654
00:48:48,662 --> 00:48:49,142
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

655
00:48:49,202 --> 00:48:50,123
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Clerk, I'd like to speak.

656
00:48:51,805 --> 00:48:55,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to follow up on your point, Council Marks, the council can move a polling place.

657
00:48:59,857 --> 00:49:03,098
[SPEAKER_06]: outside the census process and has done that.

658
00:49:03,418 --> 00:49:11,801
[SPEAKER_06]: The council moved the poll in place for 3-1 out of Lawrence Memorial, the former Lawrence Memorial Hospital into the American Legion.

659
00:49:13,161 --> 00:49:18,023
[SPEAKER_06]: Moved 8-2 out of the VFW and into the South Medford Fire Station.

660
00:49:18,863 --> 00:49:20,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Moved 2-1 out of St.

661
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,624
[SPEAKER_06]: Francis and into the Roberts School.

662
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:24,045
[SPEAKER_06]: So the council, I mean,

663
00:49:24,967 --> 00:49:31,213
[SPEAKER_06]: Sandy and I would have to look at the realignment of polling places, but we could move some polling places.

664
00:49:32,395 --> 00:49:33,596
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't want to do it wholesale.

665
00:49:33,616 --> 00:49:42,165
[SPEAKER_06]: I would want to look at them case by case, but that's one of the things we can look at regardless of the outcome of your votes over the next couple of meetings.

666
00:49:42,205 --> 00:49:45,508
[SPEAKER_06]: We can still look at realigning polling places.

667
00:49:46,409 --> 00:49:48,111
[SPEAKER_06]: That can be done outside the census process.

668
00:49:48,511 --> 00:49:59,016
[SPEAKER_06]: But for the documents Sandy's talking about, if there's a new ward created, for instance, or if there are eight new precincts created, for instance, we would have to get the polling places approved as part of this, as part of this census process.

669
00:50:00,037 --> 00:50:04,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Existing polling places can be moved around and you have, and the council has done so before.

670
00:50:04,479 --> 00:50:07,801
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

671
00:50:08,681 --> 00:50:09,862
[SPEAKER_14]: The clerk just addressed my question.

672
00:50:09,982 --> 00:50:10,242
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

673
00:50:16,281 --> 00:50:17,601
[SPEAKER_11]: Any further questions for Ms.

674
00:50:17,621 --> 00:50:17,981
[SPEAKER_11]: Gale?

675
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:28,564
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to adopt option C. On the motion to by Vice President Knight adopt sections map C, seconded by?

676
00:50:28,584 --> 00:50:28,764

723
00:52:42,925 --> 00:53:11,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Michelle Corrado, Kate Daniel, Michelle Danaher, Jessica Gatton, David Grotz, Kelsey Heavy, Michael Jefferson, David King, John Klein, Kylie Klinger, Clyde Maloney, Brendan McCabe, Matthew Morabito, Roy Monier, John Needham, James Nye, Andrew Novis, Caitlin O'Brien, Michelle O'Connell, Wendy Pilato,

724
00:53:13,186 --> 00:53:33,539
[SPEAKER_11]: Bowen Beard, Margaret Pitt, Michael Pooley, Blake Raymond, Bess Ritter, Leo Sacco, Dina Scarpelli, Michael Sullivan, William Tucker, Michael Tuttle, Gregory Wilson, Gregory 29, Jose Yaska, Jose 34.

725
00:53:37,957 --> 00:53:38,637
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Knight.

726
00:53:39,038 --> 00:53:40,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

727
00:53:40,339 --> 00:53:48,667
[SPEAKER_02]: As you read off those names, I'm sure many of us see many familiar faces, hear many familiar faces that had the opportunity to run in the Boston Marathon just the other day.

728
00:53:49,287 --> 00:54:00,238
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when you think about all the counsel Scarpelli's going through over the recent months to understand that his wife ran the Boston Marathon on Tuesday and then was there to support her family through this time of need.

729
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,560
[SPEAKER_02]: Tuesday evenings is something that's amazing.

730
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,903
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just such a sign of what a strong woman she is.

731
00:54:05,303 --> 00:54:14,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And that goes for all of these athletes that participated in the Boston Marathon, Mr. President, because it takes a certain type of person to be able to run 26.1 miles consecutively with nobody chasing you.

732
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:20,158
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I think it's beautiful that these individuals were able to get out there and get back on the track.

733
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:27,540
[SPEAKER_02]: and follow the lead of Medford's own David McGilvery, race director, and enjoying yet another successful Boston Marathon.

734
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:40,744
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, Mr. President, it's quite a celebration, a full year's worth of training goes into this, and for these individuals to have the opportunity to participate in the fashion and way that they did, something that's truly beautiful, and it's certainly what athletics is all about.

735
00:54:41,124 --> 00:54:45,345
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, Mr. President, I want to extend my condolences, my sincere

736
00:54:45,965 --> 00:54:49,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations to these individuals for participating in the Boston Marathon.

737
00:54:49,368 --> 00:54:57,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it would feel like a condolence the day after the marathon, but the accomplishment of completing it, Mr. President, is something nonetheless.

738
00:54:58,775 --> 00:54:59,676
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

739
00:54:59,716 --> 00:55:00,456
[SPEAKER_11]: Any further discussion?

740
00:55:01,377 --> 00:55:03,819
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by?

741
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:04,439
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

742
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,181
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Councilor Bears.

743
00:55:06,801 --> 00:55:07,842
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

744
00:55:11,078 --> 00:55:11,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

745
00:55:11,299 --> 00:55:11,599
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

746
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

747
00:55:12,221 --> 00:55:12,421
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

748
00:55:12,441 --> 00:55:12,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

749
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:20,633
[SPEAKER_06]: President Caraviello.

750
00:55:20,913 --> 00:55:40,262
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I mean affirmative motion passes to one five seven seven offered by Council Morell whereas the same effort currently exercises the local option for a tax deferments in accordance with mass general law chapter 59 section 5 paragraph 41 in whereas the upper income limit for eligible residents 65 and over is 50,000 per year.

751
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:52,001
[SPEAKER_11]: be it so resolved that a new tax limit for the program be set by tying it to the state senior circuit breaker tax credit yearly maximum cap.

752
00:55:52,121 --> 00:55:52,702
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Morell.

753
00:55:53,353 --> 00:55:54,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

754
00:55:54,253 --> 00:55:56,614
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, this is something we discussed in April of 2020.

755
00:55:56,674 --> 00:56:01,176
[SPEAKER_14]: The council voted to raise this to $50,000 per year.

756
00:56:01,216 --> 00:56:10,558
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is a state program that the city engages in, and the city council has the ability to set the maximum income cap for people who can participate.

757
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:17,421
[SPEAKER_14]: And it can be raised up to the senior circuit breaker number, which is adjusted every year.

758
00:56:17,561 --> 00:56:19,581
[SPEAKER_14]: When we discussed this back in April of 2020,

759
00:56:21,682 --> 00:56:27,344
[SPEAKER_14]: We're you know the council is rightfully concerned to see what we're going to get as far as real estate receipts and didn't want to raise this too high.

760
00:56:27,824 --> 00:56:40,067
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe Councilor Vice President Knight brought up the idea of just automatically tying it to the senior circuit breaker so we don't have to revisit this every so often as the state already adjusts that number reflective of cost of living.

761
00:56:40,467 --> 00:56:47,213
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a program that not a lot of people participate in, but for some people it is, you know, a lifesaver, a game changer program.

762
00:56:47,253 --> 00:56:51,677
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would just want to see that it be opened up to as many residents as possible.

763
00:56:51,717 --> 00:56:56,522
[SPEAKER_14]: But I mean, we're still talking single digits, I believe, as far as people who participate in the program.

764
00:56:57,402 --> 00:57:01,145
[SPEAKER_14]: I did ask Ellen for an updated number on number of participants.

765
00:57:01,225 --> 00:57:02,666
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have that number just yet.

766
00:57:03,666 --> 00:57:04,467
[SPEAKER_14]: We do have time.

767
00:57:04,547 --> 00:57:08,890
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe this has to be set by April for the fiscal year 2023.

768
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:14,514
[SPEAKER_14]: So if my fellow Councilors would like to see this as a committee of the whole, I'm more than happy to move it there.

769
00:57:15,194 --> 00:57:22,339
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think this is just a smart way to approach this program and then have it match that level set by the state.

770
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:33,375
[SPEAKER_11]: I would just move approval.

771
00:57:33,995 --> 00:57:35,717
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a smart program.

772
00:57:35,817 --> 00:57:41,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that the number of people who use it is pretty low and I have run into several residents in 50,000 in Medford.

773
00:57:43,212 --> 00:57:45,614
[SPEAKER_03]: is not, not a big income anymore these days.

774
00:57:45,955 --> 00:57:54,183
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I know I've talked to several people who, um, want to take advantage of this program and, and, you know, maybe their pension or their social security is a little bit more than $50,000.

775
00:57:54,603 --> 00:58:02,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I think it makes sense to, uh, to tie it to the, to the maximum allowed by the state circuit breaker tax credit.

776
00:58:02,371 --> 00:58:03,532
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why I would move approval.

777
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:06,175
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, uh, council box.

778
00:58:07,346 --> 00:58:12,810
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank my colleague for offering this tonight, Mr. President.

779
00:58:13,611 --> 00:58:21,478
[SPEAKER_13]: I see this a little differently, Mr. President, and I'm not opposed to tax deferments in our community.

780
00:58:22,238 --> 00:58:27,123
[SPEAKER_13]: I think they could help some, but as what you heard tonight, Mr. President,

781
00:58:27,603 --> 00:58:34,729
[SPEAKER_13]: There's less than a handful of people that actually choose to defer their taxes that are eligible.

782
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:43,657
[SPEAKER_13]: My issue, Mr. President, is not deferring taxes, but keeping taxes affordable in the community.

783
00:58:44,822 --> 00:58:47,723
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think that's been a long, ongoing issue.

784
00:58:48,483 --> 00:59:03,929
[SPEAKER_13]: And the more residents I bump into, in particular, seniors on fixed incomes, Mr. President, they're concerned about the raising of taxes and the talk that's been out there in the community about potential Proposition 2.5 overrides.

785
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:12,096
[SPEAKER_13]: And that scares a lot of seniors on fixed incomes, a lot of families that are struggling right now, Mr. President.

786
00:59:12,957 --> 00:59:23,267
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think those are the conversations we should be having to assist the masses regarding taxes and allowing people to stay in the community.

787
00:59:23,287 --> 00:59:26,110
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we hear all the buzzwords about affordable housing.

788
00:59:27,237 --> 00:59:33,684
[SPEAKER_13]: But when you keep on raising taxes and people can no longer live in the community, how affordable is that?

789
00:59:34,545 --> 00:59:43,675
[SPEAKER_13]: And we can have all the discussions we want around deferments, but a deferment is a 5% tax on the tax that you're not paying.

790
00:59:44,596 --> 00:59:46,618
[SPEAKER_13]: So, and that adds up, Mr. President.

791
00:59:46,978 --> 00:59:58,566
[SPEAKER_13]: And as we raise taxes every year, and God forbid there's a two and a half override, that 5% grows because of the additional tax burden that we're placing every year on residents.

792
00:59:59,106 --> 01:00:14,017
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think if we're going to get serious about looking at this, the issue is not to look at deferments, even if we raise the limits, you know, and another half a dozen people took advantage, you know, that doesn't reach the masses in the community.

793
01:00:14,337 --> 01:00:29,043
[SPEAKER_13]: It doesn't reach the seniors that are struggling, Mr. President, not just with their tax bill, with their cable bill, Mr. President, with the cost of gas, with the cost of electricity, with the cost of oil, with everything going up simultaneously.

794
01:00:29,663 --> 01:00:31,284
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what's hurting people right now.

795
01:00:31,964 --> 01:00:37,447
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'd rather have the discussions on how are we going to keep our tax rate low?

796
01:00:37,947 --> 01:00:40,208
[SPEAKER_13]: How are we going to look at other revenue sources?

797
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:44,582
[SPEAKER_13]: Are we talking about looking at generating other revenue?

798
01:00:45,342 --> 01:01:04,112
[SPEAKER_13]: As our commercial property base shrinks, and it is, Mr. President, it's no secret, as it shrinks and they double the tax rate of residential, we are going to be shifting the burden, maybe not now, maybe not next year, but eventually to the residential taxpayer.

799
01:01:04,592 --> 01:01:10,253
[SPEAKER_13]: So they're going to pay a higher tax rate because of the shrinking commercial base in this community.

800
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:24,576
[SPEAKER_13]: These are the discussions that the office of community development had, Mr. President.

801
01:01:25,136 --> 01:01:29,897
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, I want to just make sure that we're sending the right message.

802
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:37,173
[SPEAKER_13]: And maybe this council should be sending a message that we want to entertain a proposition two and a half override.

803
01:01:37,673 --> 01:01:54,921
[SPEAKER_13]: And that would allow a lot of people in this community to rest assure that whatever is done is according to the state statute, which is below two and a half, Mr. President, even that to many seniors is a tough pill to swallow.

804
01:01:55,895 --> 01:01:58,678
[SPEAKER_13]: It's between getting your medicine or paying your taxes.

805
01:01:59,378 --> 01:01:59,759
[SPEAKER_13]: Or eating.

806
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:00,660
[SPEAKER_13]: Or eating.

807
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:04,143
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's a bitter pill to swallow, Mr. President.

808
01:02:04,504 --> 01:02:05,625
[SPEAKER_13]: And we have a lot of seniors.

809
01:02:05,685 --> 01:02:09,989
[SPEAKER_13]: I've stated over and over again, we, Benford has a large percentage of seniors.

810
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:14,173
[SPEAKER_13]: So you may have bought your house 40 years ago for $130,000.

811
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:15,194
[SPEAKER_13]: Now it's worth $850,000.

812
01:02:19,717 --> 01:02:26,063
[SPEAKER_13]: But you're property rich and money poor, Mr. President, because you're living on a pension from 1970 or 1960.

813
01:02:26,364 --> 01:02:31,769
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's not keeping up with the rate of inflation.

814
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:33,731
[SPEAKER_13]: And this is what's happening.

815
01:02:33,931 --> 01:02:35,273
[SPEAKER_13]: I hear it over and over again.

816
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:37,404
[SPEAKER_13]: How can we assist?

817
01:02:37,765 --> 01:02:45,288
[SPEAKER_13]: And I tell people, in city government, it's inherent that, you know, that we have cost of living raises, we have contractual obligations.

818
01:02:45,629 --> 01:02:48,490
[SPEAKER_13]: There's a lot going on, a lot of moving parts in the city.

819
01:02:49,531 --> 01:02:52,932
[SPEAKER_13]: And I try to explain some of the modest increases that have happened.

820
01:02:53,252 --> 01:02:57,935
[SPEAKER_13]: And this council, year after year, votes, Mr. President, to shift the burden to commercial.

821
01:02:59,356 --> 01:03:02,300
[SPEAKER_13]: But eventually, the commercial businesses are saying, you know what?

822
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,082
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not going to do business in Medford.

823
01:03:04,102 --> 01:03:04,943
[SPEAKER_13]: They're crazy now.

824
01:03:05,223 --> 01:03:06,625
[SPEAKER_13]: Their tax rate's ridiculous.

825
01:03:06,865 --> 01:03:10,770
[SPEAKER_13]: I'll just go the next town over, and we'll set up shop there.

826
01:03:11,211 --> 01:03:12,793
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what we're seeing, Mr. President.

827
01:03:13,485 --> 01:03:18,249
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's unfortunate, and the burden is going to be flipped to the residential taxpayer.

828
01:03:18,609 --> 01:03:20,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Do we need to do things in the community?

829
01:03:21,571 --> 01:03:22,132
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.

830
01:03:22,172 --> 01:03:27,155
[SPEAKER_13]: The projects that we need to work on that are outside the scope of a budget, absolutely.

831
01:03:27,656 --> 01:03:29,817
[SPEAKER_13]: And those are the things we have to look at, Mr. President.

832
01:03:30,117 --> 01:03:32,399
[SPEAKER_13]: And there are other avenues to address those issues.

833
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:36,222
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not just looking at a Prop 2.5 override.

834
01:03:37,023 --> 01:03:40,085
[SPEAKER_13]: You can look at debt exclusion, which is a one-time fixed cost.

835
01:03:41,786 --> 01:03:44,007
[SPEAKER_13]: for a particular project that needs to be done.

836
01:03:44,027 --> 01:03:48,150
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm not saying we should never move ahead on projects that we need to do in the community.

837
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:50,552
[SPEAKER_13]: What I'm saying is we have to be mindful.

838
01:03:50,592 --> 01:03:56,896
[SPEAKER_13]: If we're going to talk about keeping people in their homes and making method affordable, you can't do both.

839
01:03:56,936 --> 01:04:03,500
[SPEAKER_13]: You can't raise taxes to the limit and then look at two and a half overrides and say, I'm for affordability.

840
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,101
[SPEAKER_13]: You're talking out of both sides of your mouth.

841
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:08,463
[SPEAKER_13]: And those are the discussions, Mr. President.

842
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:11,921
[SPEAKER_13]: Not an attempt, which I support.

843
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:16,484
[SPEAKER_13]: I was the one that lowered the age for senior property tax exemption from 70 to 65.

844
01:04:16,764 --> 01:04:20,346
[SPEAKER_13]: That was my resolution back many years ago, Mr. President.

845
01:04:21,447 --> 01:04:26,510
[SPEAKER_13]: Because the need was out there in the community, and it still exists out there in the community.

846
01:04:26,771 --> 01:04:32,915
[SPEAKER_13]: And I hate to see people displaced because they can't afford to pay a property tax, Mr. President.

847
01:04:33,355 --> 01:04:37,878
[SPEAKER_13]: And to me, a deferral is not the answer, especially when you keep raising taxes.

848
01:04:38,138 --> 01:04:39,219
[SPEAKER_13]: That is not the answer.

849
01:04:39,813 --> 01:04:40,534
[SPEAKER_13]: Does it help some?

850
01:04:40,914 --> 01:04:41,655
[SPEAKER_13]: It may help some.

851
01:04:42,396 --> 01:04:45,740
[SPEAKER_13]: According to the numbers, it doesn't look like it helps many in our community.

852
01:04:46,361 --> 01:04:50,326
[SPEAKER_13]: I also want people to be aware, Mr. President, the Community Preservation Act.

853
01:04:51,447 --> 01:04:57,835
[SPEAKER_13]: There is an exemption for persons with low or moderate income, and they should contact the assessor's office.

854
01:04:59,296 --> 01:05:04,840
[SPEAKER_13]: If that's a burden to you, there's an exemption by state statute that allows you to be exempt from that.

855
01:05:05,581 --> 01:05:06,701
[SPEAKER_13]: And people should be aware of that.

856
01:05:06,722 --> 01:05:09,484
[SPEAKER_13]: You'd be surprised how many people are not aware of that.

857
01:05:09,524 --> 01:05:12,085
[SPEAKER_13]: They don't know what the exemptions are.

858
01:05:13,166 --> 01:05:14,727
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's another thing, Mr. President.

859
01:05:15,008 --> 01:05:24,495
[SPEAKER_13]: There's the seniors over 70, disabled veterans in our community, which is a tax exemption, persons that are blind, Mr. President, and over 65 with low income.

860
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:31,432
[SPEAKER_13]: There's all sorts of criteria with those, but you can contact the assessor's office and they can walk you through the process.

861
01:05:33,273 --> 01:05:34,753
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think we have to have that.

862
01:05:34,773 --> 01:05:50,136
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not going to be on the council come January, but these are the discussions that I hope to leave with my colleagues to be mindful that there is other people out in the community that aren't as, uh, uh, you know, um,

863
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:55,751
[SPEAKER_13]: in a better predicament, Mr. President, that are living day to day.

864
01:05:56,511 --> 01:06:01,732
[SPEAKER_13]: You may not see them, you may not hear from them, but they're out there and they're struggling.

865
01:06:02,392 --> 01:06:03,292
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

866
01:06:04,233 --> 01:06:06,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

867
01:06:06,673 --> 01:06:07,813
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

868
01:06:08,793 --> 01:06:16,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly agree with Councilor Marks in some aspects of this discussion that it does warrant further discussion, but

869
01:06:16,935 --> 01:06:24,396
[SPEAKER_02]: In terms of the matter that's before us this evening, I think it's something that we should sit down with the city solicitor and the city assessor.

870
01:06:25,612 --> 01:06:33,078
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about what it is we need to do to use the appropriate language to further enhance this local option.

871
01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:47,510
[SPEAKER_02]: It does warrant a bit of further discussion, and the reason I think it warrants a bit of further discussion is because I want to make sure that we do it right, so that these individuals that do become eligible for this deferment can apply for it and the council can do it procedurally properly.

872
01:06:48,692 --> 01:06:50,233
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look at the deferment, it's a deferment.

873
01:06:50,293 --> 01:06:51,294
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not an exemption.

874
01:06:52,015 --> 01:06:53,436
[SPEAKER_02]: The individual is going to have to pay it back.

875
01:06:54,316 --> 01:06:57,859
[SPEAKER_02]: So really what this does is it provides somebody with a housing stability option.

876
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:05,444
[SPEAKER_02]: It expands access to a safety net program, Mr. President, and it gives us another tool, the toolbox that we can use to help people here in this community.

877
01:07:07,385 --> 01:07:09,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilmax makes very valid points.

878
01:07:11,108 --> 01:07:12,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very valid points.

879
01:07:12,249 --> 01:07:23,678
[SPEAKER_02]: But ultimately, right now, with this matter before us, we have a piece of paper that allows us to exercise a local option that's within our scope, purview, and discretion of this council to act.

880
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:25,739
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it

881
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:35,223
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, highlights the value of deferment when we talk about all these issues that are going on in this community and the push and pull of people, a feeling when it comes to the pocketbook.

882
01:07:36,584 --> 01:07:39,425
[SPEAKER_02]: So for those reasons, Mr. President, I certainly support the measure.

883
01:07:39,445 --> 01:07:41,086
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a great idea, Councilor Morell.

884
01:07:41,386 --> 01:07:42,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder where you got it.

885
01:07:43,026 --> 01:07:43,227
[SPEAKER_02]: And

886
01:07:45,948 --> 01:07:53,954
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm hoping that we can meet on it in a committee of the whole with the assessor and the city solicitor to further discuss it because I do think it provides value to the community, Mr. President.

887
01:07:54,635 --> 01:08:03,281
[SPEAKER_02]: What it does is it says if somebody has a difficult time paying, they can come to the city and if they meet the income guidelines and the qualifications, they can defer those payments.

888
01:08:03,321 --> 01:08:06,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that there's anything scary or wrong with that.

889
01:08:06,543 --> 01:08:08,745
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's a service that we could provide here.

890
01:08:09,325 --> 01:08:12,828
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that it's something that would be beneficial to not many, but some.

891
01:08:13,348 --> 01:08:15,129
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we're helping somebody, then we're doing good.

892
01:08:15,269 --> 01:08:20,611
[SPEAKER_02]: So for those reasons, I support the paper, Mr. President, and I'd suggest that we meet the committee of the whole.

893
01:08:20,631 --> 01:08:21,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Mr. President.

894
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:30,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to withdraw my motion, but I do just want to say that about 25 minutes ago, we were talking about the fact that we're spending a dollar per household per year on rat control.

895
01:08:32,255 --> 01:08:37,077
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we want to talk about our priorities and what we're doing as a city,

896
01:08:38,087 --> 01:08:42,051
[SPEAKER_03]: and our city budget to do more with less every year, every year, every year.

897
01:08:42,071 --> 01:08:43,452
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand the pressures.

898
01:08:43,632 --> 01:08:47,476
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand that there are a lot of people in this city who need help.

899
01:08:48,076 --> 01:08:53,762
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need to have every tool in the toolbox on the table because it is meeting priorities.

900
01:08:53,802 --> 01:08:56,864
[SPEAKER_03]: It's taking a hundred different things and trying to figure out

901
01:08:57,665 --> 01:08:58,926
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we move the city forward?

902
01:08:59,046 --> 01:09:02,288
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we do it without negatively impacting people the best way we can?

903
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:06,670
[SPEAKER_03]: But when we're talking about 2.5% per year, which is the limit right now, right?

904
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:08,912
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the tax limit that the state has enforced on us.

905
01:09:09,592 --> 01:09:10,653
[SPEAKER_03]: It's below inflation.

906
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:14,035
[SPEAKER_03]: It's below the inflation and the health care costs that the city pays every year.

907
01:09:14,055 --> 01:09:17,097
[SPEAKER_03]: It's below the inflation and the salary costs that the city pays every year.

908
01:09:17,457 --> 01:09:21,699
[SPEAKER_03]: We have $100 million street and sidewalk backlog, but we have a fire headquarters that needs to be built.

909
01:09:21,739 --> 01:09:23,180
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a high school that's falling apart.

910
01:09:23,661 --> 01:09:25,342
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we're going to talk about, you know,

911
01:09:26,022 --> 01:09:33,711
[SPEAKER_03]: when talking both sides of our mouths, we need to talk about what are we doing to address the long-term trends and issues in this city that people want to see fixed.

912
01:09:34,252 --> 01:09:36,735
[SPEAKER_03]: We get what we pay for, and that's the result.

913
01:09:36,975 --> 01:09:37,876
[SPEAKER_03]: We're living with the result.

914
01:09:38,743 --> 01:09:42,184
[SPEAKER_03]: We live with $100 million street and sidewalk backlog that I hear about every day.

915
01:09:42,865 --> 01:09:45,446
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you ask seniors, how can we give you options?

916
01:09:45,486 --> 01:09:48,347
[SPEAKER_03]: How can we give you help to keep the city more affordable?

917
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:52,728
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're saying, well, you know, we can do this deferment, we can do an exemption.

918
01:09:53,049 --> 01:09:56,190
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked about an owner occupied exemption, which I think can help a lot of people.

919
01:09:56,930 --> 01:10:09,460
[SPEAKER_03]: is the solution or the opposite to say your sidewalk's not gonna be safe for you to walk down, that you're gonna have someone in a wheelchair falling out of a wheelchair because the sidewalk is broken or the street is broken or you can't cross the street because there's a 50-year-old light?

920
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:19,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so if we're gonna talk about the needs and priorities of this community and the budget that we have versus the budget that we deserve, we need every tool in the toolbox on the table.

921
01:10:19,687 --> 01:10:20,968
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm withdrawing my motion.

922
01:10:21,028 --> 01:10:22,470
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm more than fine to talk about

923
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:25,712
[SPEAKER_03]: with the solicitor and figuring out how to make this work.

924
01:10:26,112 --> 01:10:38,199
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the larger picture and the larger puzzle, it can't just be telling residents, do more with less, do more with less, do more with less, or telling city staff, do more with less, do more with less, because that's what we have right now, and it hasn't worked.

925
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:44,403
[SPEAKER_03]: DPWs at half staff, a third of what it should be.

926
01:10:44,523 --> 01:10:48,446
[SPEAKER_03]: City departments are all over the place with half as many people as need to be there.

927
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:52,930
[SPEAKER_03]: to get the job done, that's a major issue too.

928
01:10:53,191 --> 01:10:54,936
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need to look at it holistically.

929
01:10:55,723 --> 01:10:57,443
[SPEAKER_03]: We need every piece of the puzzle.

930
01:10:57,483 --> 01:10:58,904
[SPEAKER_03]: We need every tool in our toolbox.

931
01:10:58,964 --> 01:11:00,844
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree we should have more commercial development.

932
01:11:00,924 --> 01:11:01,844
[SPEAKER_03]: How are we gonna do that?

933
01:11:02,364 --> 01:11:04,745
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree that we should be helping people who are in need.

934
01:11:05,145 --> 01:11:08,545
[SPEAKER_03]: And whether it's five people or 5,000 people, we should do that.

935
01:11:08,985 --> 01:11:22,808
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day, do more with less leads to the results that we've gotten for a long time, which is we don't have the infrastructure, the services, or the buildings that people wanna see, that people deserve to provide basic services.

936
01:11:23,644 --> 01:11:25,967
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a piece of this puzzle as well.

937
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:28,770
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we're going to talk about it, we have to talk about the whole thing.

938
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:35,578
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think we should be leaving anything on the, on the sideline when we're talking about how to solve the problems that people in this city want to see solved.

939
01:11:37,013 --> 01:11:37,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

940
01:11:37,333 --> 01:11:38,534
[SPEAKER_03]: Councilor Morell.

941
01:11:39,374 --> 01:11:39,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

942
01:11:40,075 --> 01:11:42,596
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm happy to change my motion to send it to Committee of the Whole.

943
01:11:42,616 --> 01:11:46,539
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, to Vice President Knight's point, we want to make sure we get this right.

944
01:11:46,939 --> 01:11:49,580
[SPEAKER_14]: We have until, I believe, April to figure this out.

945
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:55,364
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to have, if possible, have that meeting as soon as possible so people know what's coming down the pike and we can get this set.

946
01:11:56,084 --> 01:11:58,746
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'm fine to send it to Committee of the Whole.

947
01:11:58,766 --> 01:11:59,586
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marksley.

948
01:12:00,106 --> 01:12:01,087
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

949
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:06,210
[SPEAKER_13]: I guess it's easy to always try to throw money at a problem.

950
01:12:07,131 --> 01:12:11,914
[SPEAKER_13]: and not look at what currently exists and how you can work more efficiently, Mr. President.

951
01:12:12,755 --> 01:12:25,503
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, it's easy to go back to the well unless you've paid a tax, unless you had to make a decision between your mortgage or your food or your medicine.

952
01:12:25,903 --> 01:12:29,585
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's easy to talk in theory unless you actually lived that.

953
01:12:30,626 --> 01:12:32,828
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's people in our community living it right now.

954
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:46,583
[SPEAKER_13]: So my concern, Mr. President, is not looking at a tax deferment that currently may assist a half a dozen people, and then if we change it, it assists a dozen people.

955
01:12:47,344 --> 01:12:49,446
[SPEAKER_13]: That's being disingenuous.

956
01:12:49,527 --> 01:12:52,109
[SPEAKER_13]: That's saying, oh, look what we're doing to assist.

957
01:12:53,207 --> 01:12:56,831
[SPEAKER_13]: The issue is, Mr. President, the tax burden on our residents.

958
01:12:57,471 --> 01:13:00,455
[SPEAKER_13]: That's the issue, not deferring someone's taxes.

959
01:13:01,035 --> 01:13:07,682
[SPEAKER_13]: How magnanimous is that, that we'll keep on raising your taxes, may even go up over two and a half, but we'll let you defer it at 5%.

960
01:13:07,922 --> 01:13:10,205
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't hear anyone talking about the 5%.

961
01:13:11,526 --> 01:13:13,127
[SPEAKER_13]: That gets brushed under the rug.

962
01:13:13,428 --> 01:13:15,990
[SPEAKER_13]: At 5%, we'll let you defer your taxes.

963
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:29,662
[SPEAKER_13]: So Mrs. McGlynn on High Street, we know you can't afford it, but on top of that, we're gonna charge you an additional 5% and we're gonna raise your taxes even higher than they were last year.

964
01:13:30,302 --> 01:13:31,363
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how great we are.

965
01:13:31,423 --> 01:13:37,869
[SPEAKER_13]: That's how much we care about the people on fixed incomes and the seniors and the families that are struggling right now.

966
01:13:38,725 --> 01:13:49,069
[SPEAKER_13]: So I believe that, and I've seen this budget grow over the years, Mr. President, and city services have not gotten any better with the increase in budget.

967
01:13:49,529 --> 01:13:51,090
[SPEAKER_13]: So it is a matter of priorities.

968
01:13:51,750 --> 01:14:00,633
[SPEAKER_13]: And my priority would be to set a standard, Mr. President, when we talk about city services, that would be a standard that's set, that's currently not there.

969
01:14:01,253 --> 01:14:02,894
[SPEAKER_13]: We have the money to operate this city.

970
01:14:03,854 --> 01:14:05,935
[SPEAKER_13]: There's plenty of money to operate this city.

971
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:09,692
[SPEAKER_13]: We just have to work smarter, Mr. President.

972
01:14:09,732 --> 01:14:16,877
[SPEAKER_13]: We got to be more efficient and we have to rely on those that have given to this community over the years and say, you know what?

973
01:14:17,258 --> 01:14:23,723
[SPEAKER_13]: We're not going to force you out of the community now because we want to all of a sudden address everything under the sun.

974
01:14:24,423 --> 01:14:29,047
[SPEAKER_13]: And if it takes a two and a half override, no one wants to talk about two and a half override.

975
01:14:31,069 --> 01:14:33,731
[SPEAKER_13]: They'll come to the one yard line, but they won't push it over.

976
01:14:34,151 --> 01:14:36,033
[SPEAKER_13]: No one wants to talk about a two and a half override.

977
01:14:37,745 --> 01:14:42,647
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you listen carefully, you'll hear two and a half override.

978
01:14:43,147 --> 01:14:46,828
[SPEAKER_13]: You'll hear the mumblings of a two and a half override, Mr. President.

979
01:14:49,009 --> 01:14:52,950
[SPEAKER_13]: And I don't want to be there in a year from now telling residents, I told you so.

980
01:14:54,731 --> 01:14:57,672
[SPEAKER_13]: That was the intent from the beginning, a two and a half override.

981
01:15:00,453 --> 01:15:02,634
[SPEAKER_13]: And there's all this talk about affordability.

982
01:15:04,782 --> 01:15:09,726
[SPEAKER_13]: How affordable is it when you have to move out of the city because you can't afford your taxes, Mr. President?

983
01:15:11,987 --> 01:15:12,348
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

984
01:15:13,128 --> 01:15:13,709
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

985
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:15,250
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

986
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:28,920
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank my colleagues for their thoughts on this, because I could definitely see both sides, but I agree with Councilor Knight that this should go to Committee of the Whole for further review and discussion with the city solicitor and the city assessor.

987
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:32,243
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would second that motion to move it to Committee of the Whole.

988
01:15:33,744 --> 01:15:33,944
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

989
01:15:35,878 --> 01:15:36,398
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

990
01:15:36,458 --> 01:15:39,300
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to reiterate my point that this is a state program.

991
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:42,722
[SPEAKER_14]: I agree with what everyone said about just using all the tools in our toolbox.

992
01:15:42,802 --> 01:15:44,262
[SPEAKER_14]: It's something that's easy for us to do.

993
01:15:44,803 --> 01:15:48,245
[SPEAKER_14]: It's something we talked about revisiting, you know, a year and a half ago.

994
01:15:48,725 --> 01:15:53,568
[SPEAKER_14]: It's something that Housing Medford, I believe, first came to the council about, like, three years ago.

995
01:15:54,248 --> 01:15:56,489
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's all I'm advocating for.

996
01:15:56,549 --> 01:16:02,352
[SPEAKER_14]: And I hope my colleagues will agree to send this to the committee to further discuss.

997
01:16:02,573 --> 01:16:02,853
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

998
01:16:03,883 --> 01:16:05,363
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President.

999
01:16:05,984 --> 01:16:14,326
[SPEAKER_13]: And like I said from the beginning, I support this and I've supported this and any other tax deferment and tax exemption for the last 20 years.

1000
01:16:14,346 --> 01:16:15,486
[SPEAKER_13]: So I've been consistent on this.

1001
01:16:15,886 --> 01:16:21,988
[SPEAKER_13]: What I've been advocating against Mr. President is the steady increase of taxes over the years.

1002
01:16:22,608 --> 01:16:28,949
[SPEAKER_13]: And then the recent dialogue and discussion in this community about a prop two and a half override.

1003
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:30,690
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what's getting me, Mr. President.

1004
01:16:31,772 --> 01:16:32,633
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what's getting me.

1005
01:16:32,993 --> 01:16:43,083
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's going to hurt a lot of good, hardworking people, a lot of seniors in this community, a lot of families that are struggling to make ends meet, sending their kids to school and so forth.

1006
01:16:43,343 --> 01:16:55,835
[SPEAKER_13]: And unless you're in that predicament, Mr. President, unless you've paid a tax, unless you've had to make a decision between food or medication or whether you're going to stay in your home, you really don't understand the issue.

1007
01:16:57,074 --> 01:17:04,037
[SPEAKER_13]: And giving a tax deferment is not the solve-all that's going to help a few limited people, Mr. President.

1008
01:17:04,197 --> 01:17:05,158
[SPEAKER_13]: That's what it boils down to.

1009
01:17:05,338 --> 01:17:24,907
[SPEAKER_13]: But if the council wants to spin their wheels on that and not talk about the larger issues on how we're going to operate a city, Mr. President, with the current infrastructure that we have and the current taxes that we have, then it's going to keep on going on and on, and it's going to be a never-ending race to the top, Mr. President.

1010
01:17:24,927 --> 01:17:25,227
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1011
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:42,648
[SPEAKER_11]: If I could put my two cents in there, you know, uh, being the senior citizen now in the room, uh, I, I see things a little different now than I said, because now, um, my council Councilor Marks mentioned, uh, we were all house rich.

1012
01:17:43,389 --> 01:17:44,930
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm one of those people that are very house rich.

1013
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:47,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, where do I, where do I go with my house?

1014
01:17:48,205 --> 01:18:03,121
[SPEAKER_11]: I move out of the community can't say near the other otherwise say I say well, but a lot of people want to understand this when you reach a certain age like I am you know the advice that you're given is to take the house out of your name and put in your children's name.

1015
01:18:04,705 --> 01:18:12,948
[SPEAKER_11]: So in the event you go into a nursing home or something like that, so these people are no longer eligible for the senior tax rate anymore.

1016
01:18:13,469 --> 01:18:14,869
[SPEAKER_11]: So everybody forgets about that.

1017
01:18:14,889 --> 01:18:19,611
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's a lot of people in the community that, yes, they're living in, you know, you're living out,

1018
01:18:20,431 --> 01:18:29,080
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, they've turned the house over to the children because in the event they have to go into a nursing home or something, they don't want to lose their home.

1019
01:18:29,361 --> 01:18:33,425
[SPEAKER_11]: But now they're no longer eligible for the tax breaks that seniors get.

1020
01:18:33,805 --> 01:18:35,627
[SPEAKER_11]: And people seem to forget that, let's say.

1021
01:18:36,568 --> 01:18:38,589
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the, uh, I'm the senior citizens up here now.

1022
01:18:39,029 --> 01:18:46,013
[SPEAKER_11]: I, you know, I, you know, and, uh, and I, I'm hearing advice that I'm being given what to do with my house, you know, things like that.

1023
01:18:46,233 --> 01:18:54,798
[SPEAKER_11]: So please take that in mind that when we talk about, uh, giving the breaks, the people that live in the house that really don't own the house anymore.

1024
01:18:55,278 --> 01:18:57,299
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's, that's, that's part of the problem too.

1025
01:18:57,619 --> 01:19:03,062
[SPEAKER_11]: So, and I just say, when we, when we go into that discussion, please take that in, uh, into consideration.

1026
01:19:05,964 --> 01:19:06,104
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

1027
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:08,981
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Councilor Rao, do you wanna send that?

1028
01:19:09,001 --> 01:19:14,122
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sorry, we have, Mr. Castagnetti, name and address of the record, please.

1029
01:19:15,602 --> 01:19:18,763
[SPEAKER_07]: Andrew Castagnetti, can you hear me?

1030
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:20,283
[SPEAKER_07]: We can hear you.

1031
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:23,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Mr. Calviello.

1032
01:19:23,724 --> 01:19:28,486
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. President, I just wanted to add a few comments.

1033
01:19:29,406 --> 01:19:33,927
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Marks is absolutely correct, he speaks perfectly.

1034
01:19:34,838 --> 01:19:39,000
[SPEAKER_07]: As a matter of fact, I wish he was mayor for the last 10 years in this community.

1035
01:19:42,621 --> 01:19:50,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, we have a perfect solution that I've been presenting to the council for at least 17 years.

1036
01:19:52,705 --> 01:20:01,608
[SPEAKER_07]: And that is to help the unoccupied real estate owner through a Massachusetts state law.

1037
01:20:02,828 --> 01:20:12,173
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's called Chapter 59, Section 5C, Massachusetts law, owner-occupied real estate tax exemption.

1038
01:20:13,334 --> 01:20:24,360
[SPEAKER_07]: And simply put, it would save the average homeowner in our city who live in their house, it's an 85% perfect solution, about $2,300 per year.

1039
01:20:30,695 --> 01:20:38,297
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been missing out on this exemption since its inception, when Chelsea got into it, when the state started in 1998.

1040
01:20:39,277 --> 01:20:53,661
[SPEAKER_07]: If we averaged $1,000 that we lost, we overpaid for the last 20-something years, that's over $20,000, not counting juice, meaning interest.

1041
01:20:54,762 --> 01:20:57,842
[SPEAKER_07]: That's, to me, it's like robbery of the people.

1042
01:20:58,423 --> 01:20:59,903
[SPEAKER_07]: And a lot of us are seniors.

1043
01:21:00,705 --> 01:21:06,130
[SPEAKER_07]: House rich for sure, cash poor with cigarettes at $13 per pack.

1044
01:21:07,711 --> 01:21:11,955
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyways, I can't understand why the city does not adopt it.

1045
01:21:12,535 --> 01:21:23,085
[SPEAKER_07]: If four out of seven Councilors adopt it, the mayor says, yes, it's done, and a snap of a finger with the state house.

1046
01:21:23,465 --> 01:21:23,905
[SPEAKER_07]: We get it.

1047
01:21:25,187 --> 01:21:25,867
[SPEAKER_07]: End of story.

1048
01:21:26,147 --> 01:21:26,648
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way,

1049
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:31,353
[SPEAKER_07]: An override never happened in this community since I've been here for over 60 years.

1050
01:21:33,415 --> 01:21:33,715
[SPEAKER_07]: Never.

1051
01:21:34,355 --> 01:21:42,521
[SPEAKER_07]: We're not Winchester with multiple overrides of Barbara Anderson's prop two and a half, rest her soul.

1052
01:21:43,542 --> 01:21:44,483
[SPEAKER_07]: And nor have we done any

1053
01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:50,193
[SPEAKER_07]: debt exclusions like Winchester High School did for their high school for $100 million.

1054
01:21:50,473 --> 01:22:03,660
[SPEAKER_07]: And my old friend, the bookie from Tough Spark, was on South Border Road living in Winchester, says, Andrew, this thing cost me 800 bucks per year for the next 20 years to pay you off the Winchester New High School.

1055
01:22:05,401 --> 01:22:06,142
[SPEAKER_07]: This is nuts.

1056
01:22:06,722 --> 01:22:07,563
[SPEAKER_07]: We're having troubles.

1057
01:22:08,043 --> 01:22:09,484
[SPEAKER_07]: Forget two and a half overrides.

1058
01:22:09,884 --> 01:22:10,864
[SPEAKER_07]: You already have $180 million plus budget.

1059
01:22:14,277 --> 01:22:16,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Just cut the fat and get the job done.

1060
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:16,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Good night.

1061
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:20,319
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Mr. Kessling.

1062
01:22:20,359 --> 01:22:24,621
[SPEAKER_11]: Remember, when you cut someone's taxes, then someone else's taxes are going to have to get raised.

1063
01:22:26,922 --> 01:22:27,762
[SPEAKER_07]: Point of information.

1064
01:22:29,363 --> 01:22:31,284
[SPEAKER_07]: May I make a counterpoint, please?

1065
01:22:31,984 --> 01:22:32,624
[SPEAKER_07]: It's important.

1066
01:22:33,424 --> 01:22:34,025
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Knight.

1067
01:22:35,245 --> 01:22:40,667
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's important to point out, Mr. President, when we set the tax rate this past year at $9.43 per thousand dollars of valuation for residential properties,

1068
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:46,584
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that we did discuss was the residential property tax exemption.

1069
01:22:47,265 --> 01:22:55,251
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we went through this exercise in determining whether or not that would be something that was good for the community, I believe what was established was a break-even point of $727,000.

1070
01:22:55,551 --> 01:22:58,673
[SPEAKER_02]: So any home that was valued over $727,000 that was owner-occupied would not see

1071
01:23:05,452 --> 01:23:11,895
[SPEAKER_02]: an increase in the tax bill of the percentage that we so chose to apply.

1072
01:23:11,915 --> 01:23:18,958
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, what they'd see would be an increase in their tax bill above and beyond what their regular taxation would be without an owner-occupied exemption.

1073
01:23:19,519 --> 01:23:28,123
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are over 4,000 homes in this community, Mr. President, that are over the $727,000 breakeven point, and over 1,300 of those homes are occupied by individuals that are senior citizens.

1074
01:23:33,105 --> 01:23:41,328
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is why the Metro City Council, when we set the tax rate, did not adopt the residential exemption, if I remember correctly, Mr. President.

1075
01:23:41,368 --> 01:23:46,409
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just want to get that out there, because I know Mr. Castagnetti asked why that wasn't adopted.

1076
01:23:46,649 --> 01:23:55,072
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why, because there are 4,000 homes that are owner-occupied in this community that would see an increase in the tax bill, not a decrease in the tax bill.

1077
01:23:55,472 --> 01:23:57,273
[SPEAKER_02]: and with the breakeven of $727,000 a few.

1078
01:23:57,373 --> 01:24:06,055
[SPEAKER_02]: We're an owner-occupied home owner, say, in East Ford, at a two-family home.

1079
01:24:06,415 --> 01:24:09,576
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like you may actually be above and beyond that breakeven point.

1080
01:24:09,696 --> 01:24:13,357
[SPEAKER_02]: You could actually probably see an increase in your taxes, not that owner-occupied exemption.

1081
01:24:13,937 --> 01:24:18,278
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why the council did not adopt it in the past, historically speaking, Mr. President.

1082
01:24:18,499 --> 01:24:19,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. President?

1083
01:24:19,499 --> 01:24:19,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Council Bass.

1084
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:30,045
[SPEAKER_03]: And to that point exactly, one of the questions I asked when we discussed it, well, if we know how many are above the break-even and we know how many seniors live in those units, how many below the break-even and how many seniors live in those units?

1085
01:24:31,025 --> 01:24:32,586
[SPEAKER_03]: And this zero-sum game is killing us.

1086
01:24:32,726 --> 01:24:33,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't disagree.

1087
01:24:34,006 --> 01:24:35,187
[SPEAKER_03]: The state has set our laws.

1088
01:24:35,227 --> 01:24:38,108
[SPEAKER_03]: They've said, you know, these are your rules.

1089
01:24:38,168 --> 01:24:38,869
[SPEAKER_03]: It's zero-sum.

1090
01:24:39,869 --> 01:24:41,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody does more, somebody does less.

1091
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:45,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be happy for us to find an alternative and ask the state to let us do it.

1092
01:24:46,291 --> 01:25:00,657
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we could be talking about progressive rates, we could be talking about a graduated rate system, but at the end of the day, what you just said, if there's 4,000 above, you know, that means there's as many as 11,000 below, given how many structures and households there are in the city.

1093
01:25:01,537 --> 01:25:06,039
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we're talking about what Councilor Marks is talking about, which is helping the people who are closest to the edge,

1094
01:25:07,003 --> 01:25:08,785
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's part of the answer.

1095
01:25:09,205 --> 01:25:15,772
[SPEAKER_03]: So if everything's zero sum, then we're going to be putting our wheels through the mud and not going anywhere.

1096
01:25:16,313 --> 01:25:18,955
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the position that state law has decided to leave us in.

1097
01:25:19,216 --> 01:25:21,578
[SPEAKER_03]: So at a certain point,

1098
01:25:22,646 --> 01:25:26,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think people are going to say, well, you know, that's it.

1099
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:27,107
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the answer.

1100
01:25:27,127 --> 01:25:28,268
[SPEAKER_03]: It's zero sum.

1101
01:25:28,328 --> 01:25:33,569
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just got to sit here and, uh, you know, twist in the wind until somebody comes and saves us.

1102
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:39,791
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need to have a plan to address these problems, to assess our needs and meet those needs.

1103
01:25:41,712 --> 01:25:44,073
[SPEAKER_11]: If you want to tax a non-auto occupier, then rent score.

1104
01:25:47,031 --> 01:25:50,233
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, people elect us to make hard decisions, Mr. President.

1105
01:25:51,654 --> 01:25:53,275
[SPEAKER_03]: People elect us to make difficult decisions.

1106
01:25:53,295 --> 01:25:54,116
[SPEAKER_03]: And we make them every day.

1107
01:25:55,276 --> 01:25:55,837
[SPEAKER_11]: Make them every day.

1108
01:25:55,857 --> 01:25:56,877
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

1109
01:25:56,958 --> 01:26:00,500
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the motion by Councilor Morell, do you send this to a committee of the whole?

1110
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,340
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1111
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:02,081
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by?

1112
01:26:02,861 --> 01:26:03,162
[SPEAKER_09]: Seconded.

1113
01:26:03,562 --> 01:26:04,743
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Morell?

1124
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:16,130
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1126
01:26:18,349 --> 01:26:18,609
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_06]: President Caraviello?

1128
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:21,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, I'm in the affirmative.

1129
01:26:21,831 --> 01:26:22,591
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion passes.

1130
01:26:23,472 --> 01:26:36,399
[SPEAKER_11]: 21578 offered by Vice President Knight being so resolved that the Medford City Council requests that the city administration take the appropriate steps to have the exposed castings along Mystic Avenue clearly marked in identifiable.

1131
01:26:36,459 --> 01:26:37,220
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Knight.

1132
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:42,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Mr. President, if anything happened to me at the barbershop the other day,

1133
01:26:43,368 --> 01:26:50,670
[SPEAKER_02]: as I drove down Main Street and merged onto Mystic Avenue, then was right in front of Exploit Towing.

1134
01:26:51,631 --> 01:26:55,172
[SPEAKER_02]: The pavement gets a little milled, a little rocky.

1135
01:26:55,212 --> 01:26:56,412
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some construction going on.

1136
01:26:56,692 --> 01:27:02,934
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a number of castings, Mr. President, along that stretch and further down where they're doing this work that aren't clearly marked.

1137
01:27:03,634 --> 01:27:05,995
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got two flat tires.

1138
01:27:06,475 --> 01:27:12,456
[SPEAKER_02]: driving down Mr. Cab the other day, Mr. President, on Wednesday night, because the casting wasn't clearly marked and I nailed it.

1139
01:27:13,236 --> 01:27:29,440
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I was commiserating over my experience at the coffee shop just the other day with Tom Tedford from Export Towing, he started laughing and told me that he does between 15 and 20 tires a week right at that location, Mr. President.

1140
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:31,620
[SPEAKER_02]: So something's wrong there.

1141
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:35,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Something needs to be done to protect those that are traveling by motor vehicle,

1142
01:27:36,011 --> 01:27:38,934
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, down Mr. Gavin new during this construction season.

1143
01:27:39,194 --> 01:27:44,158
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, we're all anxious and looking forward to seeing Mr. Gap be fully resurfaced.

1144
01:27:44,218 --> 01:27:54,848
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the meantime, um, the 15 to 20 tires a week to get torn up, that's 15 to 20 taxpayers in this community, uh, that are going to be put through an inordinate inconvenience.

1145
01:27:55,568 --> 01:28:01,093
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, also what we're going to see, Mr. President is a rising claims, the property damage against the city.

1146
01:28:01,753 --> 01:28:05,254
[SPEAKER_02]: If in fact, we don't take the appropriate steps to properly mock these castings.

1147
01:28:05,894 --> 01:28:19,258
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that being said, I ask everybody to feel bad for me because they have two flat tires in my car and also move approval on the paper so that we can get the area or at Mystic Gap a little bit safer during this construction period, Mr. President.

1148
01:28:19,493 --> 01:28:19,973
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a moral.

1149
01:28:20,274 --> 01:28:21,254
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1150
01:28:21,314 --> 01:28:23,055
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks, Vice President Knight for bringing this forward.

1151
01:28:23,456 --> 01:28:26,918
[SPEAKER_14]: And as you say, it's something that's an inconvenience in a car, in a bike, on a bike.

1152
01:28:27,098 --> 01:28:27,979
[SPEAKER_14]: It's catastrophic.

1153
01:28:28,079 --> 01:28:29,400
[SPEAKER_14]: So I would like love.

1154
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:30,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for bringing this forward.

1155
01:28:30,701 --> 01:28:31,681
[SPEAKER_14]: I would love to see this change.

1156
01:28:32,022 --> 01:28:32,362
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

1157
01:28:33,423 --> 01:28:37,645
[SPEAKER_11]: And I was I understand it was it was five last night right at the same spot.

1158
01:28:37,685 --> 01:28:41,388
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, I think the city is going to have a little bit of a debate going forward.

1159
01:28:41,688 --> 01:28:45,271
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mr. President, what about the impact on export?

1160
01:28:45,311 --> 01:28:46,552
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me.

1161
01:28:46,692 --> 01:28:46,932
[SPEAKER_03]: He said

1162
01:28:49,317 --> 01:28:51,198
[SPEAKER_11]: Supporting business in our community.

1163
01:28:52,939 --> 01:28:58,183
[SPEAKER_11]: So the motion by Vice President seconded by excuse me.

1164
01:29:01,045 --> 01:29:02,246
[SPEAKER_04]: Name and address of the record please.

1165
01:29:02,446 --> 01:29:03,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave.

1166
01:29:04,687 --> 01:29:13,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Besides marking, is it possible that there's something you could put around the casting so that you can drive over paint and you'll still wind up with a flat tire?

1167
01:29:14,401 --> 01:29:22,568
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can't imagine that there isn't something around the casting that slopes so that if you do happen to drive over it, you don't wind up with the flat tire and you can see it.

1168
01:29:23,368 --> 01:29:24,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Just something to consider.

1169
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:25,210
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a desk geek.

1170
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:33,556
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the best practices are or what they use out there in the construction field, but I'm sure that they get something better than my idea out there.

1171
01:29:33,576 --> 01:29:34,277
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure of that.

1172
01:29:34,497 --> 01:29:36,879
[SPEAKER_11]: All in the motion by Vice President Hayes.

1173
01:29:36,919 --> 01:29:37,459
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by?

1174
01:29:37,479 --> 01:29:38,020
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

1175
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:39,441
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

1176
01:29:39,461 --> 01:29:40,442
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1177
01:29:43,483 --> 01:29:43,763
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1178
01:29:44,983 --> 01:29:45,223
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1179
01:29:45,463 --> 01:29:46,004
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1180
01:29:46,044 --> 01:29:47,044
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1181
01:29:47,304 --> 01:29:48,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1182
01:29:48,504 --> 01:29:49,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1183
01:29:51,945 --> 01:29:52,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1184
01:29:54,305 --> 01:29:54,565
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1185
01:29:55,245 --> 01:30:10,388
[SPEAKER_11]: 70 affirmative motion passes 21579 of a vice president night being so resolved that the city council requests that the city engineer restrict the hours of construction for the project the budding the Brooke school to begin following the start of school, including the information

1186
01:30:10,968 --> 01:30:21,056
[SPEAKER_11]: implementation of road closures and be further resolved that storage and staging equipment materials and debris on public ways be relocated to a more suitable location.

1187
01:30:21,356 --> 01:30:22,117
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Knight.

1188
01:30:22,737 --> 01:30:23,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Mr. President.

1189
01:30:24,198 --> 01:30:39,130
[SPEAKER_02]: After having a whole summer off the first day of school, the city decided that it would be a good day to start a water main project on the roads abutting being Prescott Street, which I'm pretty sure you're familiar with.

1190
01:30:39,938 --> 01:30:56,173
[SPEAKER_02]: And over the course of time as the presidents in school, open those some six or seven weeks ago, what we're seeing is on various days certain roads are closed, no vehicular access during drop off period that coupled with the fact that we have, you know, gigantic dumpster construction materials and debris.

1191
01:30:57,313 --> 01:31:04,596
[SPEAKER_02]: in construction equipment parked along Prescott Street and along other side streets that are above the school, creating a situation that makes it difficult to pass, number one.

1192
01:31:05,317 --> 01:31:10,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Oddly, number two, and a concern for the children, number three, Mr. President, there in the area.

1193
01:31:11,419 --> 01:31:19,303
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a request to ask that the city engineer restrict the hours of construction for this project until such time as the students are in school.

1194
01:31:20,263 --> 01:31:22,704
[SPEAKER_02]: School starts about 8.30 in the morning, Mr. President.

1195
01:31:22,744 --> 01:31:24,705
[SPEAKER_02]: The construction crews like to get out there at 7 a.m.

1196
01:31:24,785 --> 01:31:24,985
[SPEAKER_02]: or so.

1197
01:31:25,609 --> 01:31:34,131
[SPEAKER_02]: and that hour-and-a-half window is creating a certain situation down at the school in terms of traffic gridlock, inconvenience to drop off of parents and the like.

1198
01:31:35,652 --> 01:31:46,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, coupled with the fact that if you used to go in a certain way, Mr. President, you'd drive down, say, Old Canal Street, and you'd take a left-hand turn onto Prescott, and then it says Prescott Street's closed.

1199
01:31:46,835 --> 01:31:47,435
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your option?

1200
01:31:47,455 --> 01:31:50,196
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta go over the train tracks, turn all the way around, come back.

1201
01:31:51,336 --> 01:31:52,877
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a really inconvenient situation.

1202
01:31:52,917 --> 01:31:53,617
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't really,

1203
01:31:55,822 --> 01:32:00,865
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not conducive to the free flow of traffic or a safe drive off to children down there in the area, Mr. President.

1204
01:32:00,885 --> 01:32:05,388
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just ask that the city engineer revisit the practices and hopefully come up with a plan that's a little safer.

1205
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:10,281
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1206
01:32:10,301 --> 01:32:11,902
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to thank Council and I for bringing this forward.

1207
01:32:11,942 --> 01:32:22,530
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually had the opportunity to drive by this area a number of times, and this is a major safety concern, especially with the kids in the morning going to school.

1208
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:23,711
[SPEAKER_09]: It needs to be addressed.

1209
01:32:24,632 --> 01:32:26,974
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is a good solution to look at.

1210
01:32:27,715 --> 01:32:35,201
[SPEAKER_09]: It's definitely a major concern and a major public safety concern with the children just coming and going from the school every morning.

1211
01:32:35,261 --> 01:32:37,963
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would definitely support this motion and move approval.

1212
01:32:38,929 --> 01:32:39,150
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1213
01:32:48,868 --> 01:32:49,908
[SPEAKER_11]: We had all summer to do this.

1214
01:32:50,068 --> 01:32:55,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Why did we wait until the day before the kids go to school to do this?

1215
01:32:55,390 --> 01:33:02,051
[SPEAKER_11]: And we just got through paving High Street, and now we're digging up sections of High Street that were just newly paved.

1216
01:33:02,771 --> 01:33:04,312
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's our realm over the city.

1217
01:33:04,352 --> 01:33:05,052
[SPEAKER_11]: We do a new street.

1218
01:33:05,572 --> 01:33:06,692
[SPEAKER_11]: A couple of weeks later, we pave it.

1219
01:33:07,232 --> 01:33:09,453
[SPEAKER_11]: We rip it up, and it never gets fixed correctly.

1220
01:33:10,353 --> 01:33:12,894
[SPEAKER_11]: And like I say, Councilor Knights says, I live over there.

1221
01:33:13,514 --> 01:33:16,795
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a dumpster full of pipes that's leaking rusty water.

1222
01:33:18,397 --> 01:33:19,420
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, the road's unpaved.

1223
01:33:19,782 --> 01:33:20,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Try it.

1224
01:33:20,284 --> 01:33:21,087
[SPEAKER_11]: There's equipment there.

1225
01:33:22,554 --> 01:33:23,795
[SPEAKER_11]: Try getting around that.

1226
01:33:23,815 --> 01:33:25,316
[SPEAKER_11]: That's a tough thing to get around with.

1227
01:33:25,616 --> 01:33:31,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Even with other things, with all the parents dropping kids off in their driveway, it's a real tough thing.

1228
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:36,585
[SPEAKER_11]: And then, say, that dumpster just moves down, and now it's right next door to the school today.

1229
01:33:37,225 --> 01:33:40,167
[SPEAKER_11]: I say, you had plenty of time to do this.

1230
01:33:41,008 --> 01:33:43,130
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know why we waited till the last second.

1231
01:33:43,230 --> 01:33:47,373
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know why we waited till we paved High Street to dig up these things.

1232
01:33:47,893 --> 01:33:51,276
[SPEAKER_11]: Again, we've got to get a little more coordination of these projects.

1233
01:33:52,727 --> 01:33:54,989
[SPEAKER_11]: No, again, thank you, Councilor Knight for bringing this up.

1234
01:33:55,670 --> 01:33:58,712
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the motion by Vice President Night, seconded by?

1235
01:33:59,072 --> 01:33:59,333
[SPEAKER_11]: Second.

1236
01:33:59,813 --> 01:34:00,834
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Councilor Falco.

1237
01:34:01,415 --> 01:34:02,375

01:34:06,619 --> 01:34:06,839
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Night?

1243
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:08,260

1245
01:34:09,021 --> 01:34:09,301

[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, 70 in favor of the motion passes.

1252
01:34:19,016 --> 01:34:19,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. President.

1253
01:34:21,117 --> 01:34:21,678
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

1254
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:26,002
[SPEAKER_09]: May I ask that we merge 21580 and 21581.

1255
01:34:26,262 --> 01:34:30,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I was going to ask you that.

1256
01:34:30,186 --> 01:34:34,289

1262

01:35:04,241 --> 01:35:04,882
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice President Knight.

1264
01:35:07,322 --> 01:35:11,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, as Councilor Falco has added me to his resolution, I defer to him first.

[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, President Caraviello.

1266
01:35:15,558 --> 01:35:22,780
[SPEAKER_09]: I just wanted to offer my sincere condolences to the O'Sullivan family on Mary's recent passing.

1267
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:26,861
[SPEAKER_09]: She was a lifelong resident and a very active member at St.

1268
01:35:26,901 --> 01:35:28,841
[SPEAKER_09]: Francis Parish for many, many years.

1269
01:35:29,381 --> 01:35:30,602
[SPEAKER_09]: Our thoughts and prayers to the family.

1270
01:35:30,762 --> 01:35:31,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1271
01:35:31,628 --> 01:35:32,168
[SPEAKER_02]: Vice President Knight.

1272
01:35:32,448 --> 01:35:33,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1273
01:35:33,769 --> 01:35:36,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Mary was someone who always loved watching the city council meetings.

1274
01:35:36,850 --> 01:35:41,631
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember quite frequently talking with her daughter and granddaughter about the goings on in town.

1275
01:35:41,871 --> 01:35:51,015
[SPEAKER_02]: And every once in a while, we'd get a request from Mary's daughter or granddaughter asking for a congratulations or a birthday shout out to Mary.

1276
01:35:51,075 --> 01:35:52,735
[SPEAKER_02]: And she really got a kick out of it.

1277
01:35:52,975 --> 01:35:54,096
[SPEAKER_02]: She was a great person.

1278
01:35:54,116 --> 01:35:54,956
[SPEAKER_02]: She raised a great family.

1279
01:35:55,316 --> 01:35:56,456
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's going to be sadly missed.

1280
01:35:56,757 --> 01:36:00,778
[SPEAKER_02]: So to Lauren Feldstrong and you and to the O'Sullivan family.

1281
01:36:02,599 --> 01:36:08,961
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, as I say, Mary, again, very active in the St.

1282
01:36:09,001 --> 01:36:09,742
[SPEAKER_11]: Francis community.

1283
01:36:10,362 --> 01:36:13,143
[SPEAKER_11]: And again, her presence is going to be missed.

1284
01:36:13,403 --> 01:36:14,784
[SPEAKER_11]: If we could rise for a moment of silence please.

[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1291
01:36:47,850 --> 01:36:48,651

[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1305
01:37:09,681 --> 01:37:13,024
[SPEAKER_09]: Just asked me if the DPW could fix a pothole.

1306
01:37:13,064 --> 01:37:15,086
[SPEAKER_09]: It's kind of almost like a depression in the road.

1307
01:37:15,246 --> 01:37:21,773
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks like there was some road repair work that was done previously, and it just kind of sunk over time.

1308
01:37:21,813 --> 01:37:27,038
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we could have the DPW go out and repair that sometime soon.

1309
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:30,360
[SPEAKER_09]: in the interest of public safety, greatly appreciate it.

1335
01:38:04,538 --> 01:38:05,979
[SPEAKER_11]: 2-1-583 offered by Councilor Falco.

1336
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:19,653
[SPEAKER_11]: Be it resolved that the Health Department provide the Medford City Council with the standards and protocols that are being used to test air quality, as well as the frequency of testing in all public buildings within the City of Medford.

01:38:19,673 --> 01:38:20,354
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

1338
01:38:20,674 --> 01:38:28,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President, especially with COVID-19 still with us and the new Delta variant.

1339
01:38:28,930 --> 01:38:31,254
[SPEAKER_09]: It's important that we keep up with the

1340
01:38:32,835 --> 01:38:35,396
[SPEAKER_09]: air testing, air quality testing in all our public buildings.

1341
01:38:35,876 --> 01:38:42,497
[SPEAKER_09]: It's important that the city has a plan in place to ensure the ventilation systems in the city buildings that they're checked regularly.

1342
01:38:42,517 --> 01:38:48,839
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, sometimes they're checked mechanically, other times it's just a, you know, a technician comes in to check the air quality.

1343
01:38:49,379 --> 01:38:53,520
[SPEAKER_09]: But I just wanted to get a report back from the administration with regard to

1344
01:38:54,880 --> 01:39:03,645
[SPEAKER_09]: how these buildings are being checked, how often they're being checked, and are they being checked mechanically, or is someone coming in and actually physically checking these buildings?

1345
01:39:03,665 --> 01:39:10,189
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we could get an update from the administration as soon as possible with regard to all city buildings.

1346
01:39:10,209 --> 01:39:17,513
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be schools and city hall, library, fire stations, police stations, all city buildings.

1347
01:39:17,934 --> 01:39:18,254
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1356
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:40,681
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative motion passes.

1357
01:39:41,281 --> 01:39:52,484
[SPEAKER_11]: 21584 offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the DPW install crosswalks at the intersection of Cherry Street and Salem Street and Almond Street and Salem Street in the interest of public safety.

01:39:52,504 --> 01:39:53,224
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

1359
01:39:53,704 --> 01:39:54,805
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1360
01:39:55,005 --> 01:40:00,967
[SPEAKER_09]: I received a call from a resident down in the Cherry Street area recently regarding their

1361
01:40:04,307 --> 01:40:07,649
[SPEAKER_09]: student or a child walking to school to the Roberts in the morning.

1362
01:40:07,669 --> 01:40:17,333
[SPEAKER_09]: And, uh, from Haines square to the Roberts, there's pretty much crosswalks all the way through that neighborhood with the exception of Cherry street and Salem street, Almond street and Salem street.

1363
01:40:17,893 --> 01:40:27,478
[SPEAKER_09]: So in the public interest of public safety, if we could have, uh, the DPW at some crosswalks to those, uh, those sections that I just outlined, I greatly appreciate it.

01:40:27,718 --> 01:40:28,018

1376
01:41:07,933 --> 01:41:10,973
[SPEAKER_09]: If I may add, Councilor Knight, to this as well.

1377
01:41:12,994 --> 01:41:17,514

[SPEAKER_09]: When we see

1379
01:41:21,450 --> 01:41:23,751
[SPEAKER_09]: Joe, he would always be at Firefighter Sunday.

1380
01:41:23,771 --> 01:41:24,792
[SPEAKER_09]: You'd see him every year there.

1381
01:41:25,512 --> 01:41:28,214
[SPEAKER_09]: He had breakfast with them.

1382
01:41:28,254 --> 01:41:36,058
[SPEAKER_09]: I think actually, Mr. President, you and myself actually had, we had breakfast with him this past, Firefighter Sunday, this past May.

1383
01:41:36,438 --> 01:41:40,801
[SPEAKER_09]: And great guy from all accounts, a firefighter's firefighter.

1384
01:41:41,881 --> 01:41:46,644
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, he would do anything and it was just thoughts of praise to the family.

1385
01:41:47,204 --> 01:41:50,126
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, thank you to his family for

1386
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,801
[SPEAKER_09]: his continuous commitment to the community.

1387
01:41:53,101 --> 01:41:54,142

[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1390
01:41:56,684 --> 01:42:07,170
[SPEAKER_02]: As most of you know, I have a background in organized labor, and when it comes to someone that was a fiery advocate for his membership, you couldn't find anybody better than Joe.

1391
01:42:08,631 --> 01:42:10,793
[SPEAKER_02]: When you talk to the current firefighters that have

1392
01:42:11,473 --> 01:42:20,701
[SPEAKER_02]: been around for a long time, that can share some of those old stories about what it was like negotiating contracts and going into the war room and fighting for what you need.

1393
01:42:20,961 --> 01:42:28,567
[SPEAKER_02]: They said that Joe was just quite a leader, Mr. President, someone whose actions spoke louder than his words, someone who wasn't afraid to fight the good fight.

1394
01:42:29,208 --> 01:42:36,614
[SPEAKER_02]: He's going to be sadly missed, his efforts, energies, and certainly his commitment to Local 1032 will not go unnoticed.

1395
01:42:37,074 --> 01:42:37,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody I've talked to

1396
01:42:38,870 --> 01:42:40,611
[SPEAKER_02]: has only had fond things to say about it.

1397
01:42:41,252 --> 01:42:47,359
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody I've talked to has said what a legend that this gentleman was in terms of advocating and fighting for his members.

1398
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:49,441
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1399
01:42:49,881 --> 01:42:50,342
[SPEAKER_13]: Councilor Marks.

1400
01:42:50,962 --> 01:42:51,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1401
01:42:51,823 --> 01:42:56,068
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to thank Councilor Falco and Vice President Knight for putting this on.

1402
01:42:57,749 --> 01:42:59,010
[SPEAKER_13]: I've known Joe for a lot of years.

1403
01:42:59,730 --> 01:43:03,453
[SPEAKER_13]: When I first got on the council, Joe used to come to that podium.

1404
01:43:04,033 --> 01:43:11,078
[SPEAKER_13]: And let me tell you, you couldn't meet a man that was more animated when it came to issues impacting not only the fire department.

1405
01:43:11,238 --> 01:43:16,502
[SPEAKER_13]: He was a strong advocate, as Council Vice President Knight mentioned, for his union members.

1406
01:43:17,042 --> 01:43:20,944
[SPEAKER_13]: But he was also a very strong advocate for the residents of this community.

1407
01:43:21,505 --> 01:43:35,173
[SPEAKER_13]: And he'd be the first to stand up and make sure that we had the appropriate apparatus out there to make sure residents were safe, make sure that the firefighters had the latest and greatest equipment to make sure that residents were safe, Mr. President.

1408
01:43:35,853 --> 01:43:42,660
[SPEAKER_13]: And he truly spent his time advocating, not just on the local level, but on the state level as well.

1409
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:54,010
[SPEAKER_13]: He was a fixture at the state house advocating for laws and additional funding, anything that would assist firefighters in their job, Mr. President, therefore making residents safer.

1410
01:43:54,331 --> 01:43:56,193
[SPEAKER_13]: So he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

1411
01:43:56,213 --> 01:43:56,513
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

1412
01:43:58,432 --> 01:44:06,116
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and I say, like Councilor Falco said, we had the privilege of having breakfast with him, uh, this year at the firehouse, uh, during the fireman's memorial.

1413
01:44:06,196 --> 01:44:09,698
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, and you say, you know, Joe was, uh, he was the fireman's friend.

1414
01:44:09,738 --> 01:44:13,120
[SPEAKER_11]: He was there, he was there for his men all the time, and he always did the right thing.

1415
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:18,023
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, uh, again, Joe's another gentleman that will be, uh, missed in our community.

1416
01:44:18,823 --> 01:44:20,204
[SPEAKER_11]: So, Councilor Best.

1417
01:44:21,425 --> 01:44:22,846
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, we'll rise for a moment of silence.

1418
01:44:44,065 --> 01:44:44,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1419
01:44:48,426 --> 01:44:48,646
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1420
01:44:48,806 --> 01:44:49,006
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1421
01:44:50,007 --> 01:44:50,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1422
01:44:52,367 --> 01:44:52,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1423
01:44:53,788 --> 01:44:54,028
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1424
01:44:56,988 --> 01:44:57,249
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1425
01:44:59,349 --> 01:44:59,549
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1426
01:44:59,869 --> 01:45:09,992
[SPEAKER_11]: 7 affirmative motion passes 2, 1, 5, 8, 6 of my council Falco may resolve that the administration provide a city hall staffing update to the Medford city council council Falco.

1427
01:45:10,690 --> 01:45:11,510
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1428
01:45:11,530 --> 01:45:25,014
[SPEAKER_09]: There have been a number of, let's see, postings recently with regard to open positions throughout the city hall, and just wanted to get an update with regard to where we are, where the administration is to filling these positions.

1429
01:45:25,534 --> 01:45:26,875
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been interviewing people.

1430
01:45:27,095 --> 01:45:30,036
[SPEAKER_09]: A lot of these are very important positions.

1431
01:45:30,056 --> 01:45:32,576
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to get them staffed as soon as possible.

1432
01:45:32,596 --> 01:45:37,478
[SPEAKER_09]: So I just want to get an update from the administration as to where we are with regard to having them finally staffed.

1433
01:45:37,738 --> 01:45:38,018
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1434
01:45:38,888 --> 01:45:41,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1435
01:45:41,269 --> 01:45:46,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Mister president on that point, I know that I believe it was Council of faculty with all the turnover and stuff.

1436
01:45:46,071 --> 01:45:52,173
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure we asked at this point, I think it might have been either Dave Rodriguez when he was here or at least not only when she was here.

1437
01:45:52,973 --> 01:46:02,176
[SPEAKER_02]: If we could get a copy of the organizational chart after the passage of this last budget, we saw a couple of new departments get created, a couple of new positions get created, Mr. President.

1438
01:46:02,577 --> 01:46:06,018
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was a lot of talk and discussion about what this organizational chart was going to look like.

1439
01:46:06,558 --> 01:46:09,300
[SPEAKER_02]: before all the turnover in the corner office occurred.

1440
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:16,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I was wondering, I know we've asked for it, I don't think we've received it, so I wonder if we could just reiterate that request, Mr. President, to get a copy of the organizational chart.

1441
01:46:19,803 --> 01:46:21,084
[SPEAKER_11]: Are you making that as an amendment?

1442
01:46:21,244 --> 01:46:21,744
[SPEAKER_11]: I would love to.

1443
01:46:21,965 --> 01:46:22,245
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1444
01:46:22,265 --> 01:46:23,446
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

1445
01:46:23,526 --> 01:46:24,246
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1446
01:46:24,707 --> 01:46:26,428
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree with Councilor Knight 100%.

1447
01:46:26,908 --> 01:46:29,170
[SPEAKER_09]: We should get an updated organizational chart.

1448
01:46:29,590 --> 01:46:35,434
[SPEAKER_09]: I just want to make sure that it includes the names of the people that are serving in those roles.

1449
01:46:35,514 --> 01:46:39,197
[SPEAKER_09]: I know we received an organizational chart during the budget.

1450
01:46:41,481 --> 01:46:44,682
[SPEAKER_09]: You just have positions that reported to the mayor, didn't have the names.

1451
01:46:44,782 --> 01:46:48,603
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's key that we have all the names within the organizational charts.

1452
01:46:48,623 --> 01:46:50,303
[SPEAKER_09]: You can actually know who reports to who.

1453
01:46:51,084 --> 01:46:56,025
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so, uh, as simple as task as that may seem, uh, they couldn't get it to us months ago.

1454
01:46:56,045 --> 01:46:57,425
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully they can get it to us now.

1455
01:46:57,666 --> 01:47:00,546
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1456
01:47:01,447 --> 01:47:02,947
[SPEAKER_03]: We may actually have already asked for this.

1457
01:47:02,967 --> 01:47:06,508
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a hundred percent sure, but if you'd be so amenable to having an amendment

1458
01:47:07,274 --> 01:47:11,856
[SPEAKER_03]: that we get a specific update on the parking department and the status of hiring in that department.

1459
01:47:12,316 --> 01:47:17,238
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that's included in here, but I think it's important given what Councilor Knight said about that being a new department.

1460
01:47:18,959 --> 01:47:25,122
[SPEAKER_03]: We're two months, two and a half months away from shifting over to city managed parking enforcement.

1461
01:47:26,262 --> 01:47:27,583
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I would like to have that in there.

1462
01:47:27,663 --> 01:47:28,003
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1463
01:47:29,023 --> 01:47:32,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, on that note, actually, here we are now where

1464
01:47:33,817 --> 01:47:35,818
[SPEAKER_02]: about a quarter of the way is in.

1465
01:47:35,918 --> 01:47:40,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Next week, I will be putting forward my request for an update on the city's financial health.

1466
01:47:40,559 --> 01:47:45,741
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a request that this council have put forward a resolution this council passed asking for quarterly updates from our CFO.

1467
01:47:46,421 --> 01:47:48,562
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now, I don't believe we have a CFO.

1468
01:47:50,154 --> 01:47:54,417
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's very important that we have this financial update ASAP.

1469
01:47:54,437 --> 01:47:58,520
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm asking, Mr. President, that you get in advance of me putting this on the agenda.

1470
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:06,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob, make sure you reach out to the administration and let them know that that's coming so that we can possibly have some- You can send me an email on that tomorrow, what you want, and I will take care of that.

1471
01:48:06,166 --> 01:48:06,646
[SPEAKER_11]: Certainly will.

1472
01:48:06,686 --> 01:48:07,287
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.

1473
01:48:07,647 --> 01:48:13,392
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the motion by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Bears, seconded by-

1474
01:48:15,808 --> 01:48:18,130
[SPEAKER_11]: And also as amended by Councilor, by Vice President Knight.

1475
01:48:20,372 --> 01:48:22,454
[SPEAKER_11]: And by Councilor Falco again.

1476
01:48:23,254 --> 01:48:25,276
[SPEAKER_11]: So on the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by?

1477
01:48:27,077 --> 01:48:28,098
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Councilor Bears.

1478
01:48:28,218 --> 01:48:29,339
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1479
01:48:34,684 --> 01:48:35,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears?

1480
01:48:35,584 --> 01:48:35,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1481
01:48:36,025 --> 01:48:36,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Falco?

1482
01:48:36,645 --> 01:48:36,845
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1483
01:48:37,065 --> 01:48:37,766
[SPEAKER_01]: Vice President Knight?

1484
01:48:37,826 --> 01:48:38,086
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1485
01:48:38,266 --> 01:48:38,787
[SPEAKER_01]: Councilor Parks?

1486
01:48:38,947 --> 01:48:39,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1487
01:48:39,467 --> 01:48:40,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Morell?

1488
01:48:40,208 --> 01:48:40,428
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1489
01:48:40,708 --> 01:48:41,429
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Scarpelli?

1490
01:48:42,050 --> 01:48:42,330
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1491
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:46,881
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, 7 in the affirmative motion passes.

1492
01:48:47,602 --> 01:48:56,867
[SPEAKER_11]: 21587 offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the administration provide an update regarding the upcoming leadership transition within the Medford Fire Departments.

1493
01:48:57,207 --> 01:48:58,008
[SPEAKER_11]: Councilor Falco.

1494
01:48:58,268 --> 01:48:59,148
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1495
01:48:59,168 --> 01:49:06,313
[SPEAKER_09]: We were just talking about Firefighter Sunday, and I remember when Chief Gilberti gave his speech this past year, he had mentioned

1496
01:49:06,933 --> 01:49:10,214
[SPEAKER_09]: that it would be his last speech and that he was going to be retiring.

1497
01:49:10,254 --> 01:49:12,615
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was going to be November, the end of November.

1498
01:49:13,175 --> 01:49:25,539
[SPEAKER_09]: So this is basically asking the administration to get an update with regard to the transition, how that process is going, and generally just to get an update.

1499
01:49:25,579 --> 01:49:29,181
[SPEAKER_09]: We really haven't been given any update with regard to this process whatsoever.

1500
01:49:29,201 --> 01:49:31,921
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we definitely deserve an update.

1501
01:49:34,206 --> 01:49:35,347
[SPEAKER_09]: approve their budget every year.

1502
01:49:35,967 --> 01:49:42,130
[SPEAKER_09]: This is something that we should know about, and we've received very little information so far about this process.

1503
01:49:42,610 --> 01:49:51,514
[SPEAKER_09]: So it'd be nice to get an update, or I'm actually asking for an update from the administration that we've received an update with regard to this process in the timeline as to when it's going to take place.

1504
01:49:51,794 --> 01:49:52,114
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1505
01:49:52,754 --> 01:49:53,135
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1506
01:49:53,795 --> 01:49:54,255
[SPEAKER_09]: Second.

1507
01:49:54,595 --> 01:49:56,916
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Councilor Bailão, seconded by?

1508
01:49:56,936 --> 01:49:57,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded.

1509
01:49:58,257 --> 01:49:59,257
[SPEAKER_11]: Seconded by Councilor Bears.

1510
01:49:59,277 --> 01:50:00,158
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1511
01:50:04,518 --> 01:50:04,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1512
01:50:05,779 --> 01:50:06,100
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1513
01:50:06,921 --> 01:50:07,321
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1514
01:50:08,262 --> 01:50:09,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1515
01:50:10,305 --> 01:50:10,605
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1516
01:50:12,848 --> 01:50:13,068
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

1517
01:50:13,389 --> 01:50:16,732
[SPEAKER_11]: 70 affirmative motion passes two one five eight eight off of my council Falco.

1518
01:50:17,113 --> 01:50:23,661
[SPEAKER_11]: We resolved that the administration provided an update regarding the staffing at community media council Falco.

1519
01:50:24,194 --> 01:50:25,195
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mr. President.

1520
01:50:25,235 --> 01:50:31,722
[SPEAKER_09]: This is similar to the previous resolution about staffing in general, but this is specific to message community media.

1521
01:50:32,783 --> 01:50:37,609
[SPEAKER_09]: Patrick Gordon, who helped us for so long with regard to council meetings.

1522
01:50:38,253 --> 01:50:40,034
[SPEAKER_09]: And he also worked at Medford Community Media.

1523
01:50:40,495 --> 01:50:49,281
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just basically asking for an update as to how the interview process is going for the position since he left for another community.

1524
01:50:49,721 --> 01:50:52,082
[SPEAKER_09]: Just want to know, have they interviewed anyone?

1525
01:50:52,122 --> 01:50:55,725
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they close to getting anyone to replace Patrick?

1526
01:50:56,505 --> 01:50:59,728
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'd like to request that update from the administration.

1527
01:51:00,028 --> 01:51:00,408
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

1528
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:00,908
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

[SPEAKER_13]: We do have someone in the audience that would like to speak on Riverside Ave.

1545
01:51:45,710 --> 01:51:47,251
[SPEAKER_10]: We have one more paper to go first.

1546
01:51:48,532 --> 01:51:49,233
[SPEAKER_10]: We have one more paper.

1547
01:51:49,553 --> 01:51:50,293

01:51:50,453 --> 01:51:50,633
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

1549
01:51:51,274 --> 01:51:52,515
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, this is right on the agenda.

1550
01:51:52,955 --> 01:51:53,155
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1551
01:51:53,575 --> 01:51:53,795
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.

1552
01:51:58,418 --> 01:51:58,858
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll roll, please.

1553
01:52:00,019 --> 01:52:00,519
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Perks?

1554
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:01,040
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1555
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:02,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Falcon?

1556
01:52:02,340 --> 01:52:02,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1557
01:52:03,261 --> 01:52:03,961
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Knight?

1558
01:52:04,442 --> 01:52:05,102
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we voting on?

1559
01:52:05,803 --> 01:52:06,923
[SPEAKER_02]: Suspending the vote to take the intervention.

1560
01:52:06,963 --> 01:52:07,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Under suspension.

1561
01:52:07,744 --> 01:52:07,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1562
01:52:10,198 --> 01:52:18,663
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, yes, yes, yes, affirmative motion passes.

1563
01:52:20,124 --> 01:52:34,752
[SPEAKER_11]: On the suspension, people number 21589 off of my vice president night being so resolved that the Medford City Council extended Stephen's congratulations to Maria and Michael price on their momentous occasion of the 50th wedding anniversary.

1564
01:52:34,993 --> 01:52:35,713
[SPEAKER_11]: Vice president night.

1565
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:37,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. President, thank you very much.

1566
01:52:37,821 --> 01:52:46,807
[SPEAKER_02]: These two lovebirds met back at Medford High School some many years ago and have forged a beautiful relationship and have raised a beautiful family.

1567
01:52:47,488 --> 01:52:53,451
[SPEAKER_02]: They've become grandparents, still reside in the South Medford neighborhood of this great city, Mr. President.

1568
01:52:53,571 --> 01:53:03,438
[SPEAKER_02]: Just this past weekend, surrounded by friends and family, they were surprised at their daughter-in-law's house for a 50th wedding anniversary, Mr. President, and for all accounts,

1569
01:53:04,136 --> 01:53:05,738
[SPEAKER_02]: From what I understand, it was a great success.

1570
01:53:06,199 --> 01:53:08,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael and Marie were both very, very surprised.

1571
01:53:08,241 --> 01:53:09,523
[SPEAKER_02]: They had no idea that it was happening.

1572
01:53:10,102 --> 01:53:13,423
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you know Michael and Marie, you'll know that they're two people that are just great individuals.

1573
01:53:14,123 --> 01:53:21,384
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're looking for them, you can probably find them down at La Conte Skating Rink, because between their kids and their grandkids, that's where they spend the majority of their time.

1574
01:53:22,124 --> 01:53:32,806
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're great family people, pictures in the self-benefit neighborhood, as I said, Mr. President, and they've been able to tolerate each other for 50 years with love, bliss, and kindness.

1575
01:53:33,106 --> 01:53:36,146
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's something that I look forward to celebrating someday with my wife.

1576
01:53:36,206 --> 01:53:39,467
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm very proud of them and very happy for them, and I wish them all the best.

1577
01:53:41,087 --> 01:53:46,813
[SPEAKER_11]: On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco, please call the roll.

1578
01:53:50,677 --> 01:53:50,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1579
01:53:50,857 --> 01:53:50,957
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1580
01:53:50,997 --> 01:53:51,258
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1581
01:53:51,538 --> 01:53:51,758
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1582
01:54:02,509 --> 01:54:05,910
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, 7 affirmative motion passes.

1583
01:54:05,990 --> 01:54:11,972
[SPEAKER_11]: Motion to revert back to regular business by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Bears.

1584
01:54:12,513 --> 01:54:13,813
[SPEAKER_11]: Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1585
01:54:19,555 --> 01:54:20,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Bears?

1586
01:54:20,396 --> 01:54:20,636
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1587
01:54:20,796 --> 01:54:21,276
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Talbot?

1588
01:54:21,316 --> 01:54:21,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1589
01:54:21,976 --> 01:54:22,676
[SPEAKER_06]: Vice President Banks?

1590
01:54:23,137 --> 01:54:23,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1591
01:54:23,617 --> 01:54:24,137
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Marks?

1592
01:54:24,297 --> 01:54:24,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1593
01:54:25,157 --> 01:54:25,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Morell?

1594
01:54:25,858 --> 01:54:26,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

1595
01:54:39,004 --> 01:54:41,585
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, 60 affirmative, one absent, motion passes.

1596
01:54:42,666 --> 01:54:45,889
[SPEAKER_11]: We have public participation.

1597
01:54:46,329 --> 01:54:56,617
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes, we have our resident Nate Merritt, Mr. President, from Riverside Ave that would like to address the issue of national grids work taking place at the corner of Locust and Riverside Ave.

1598
01:54:57,282 --> 01:54:58,643
[SPEAKER_11]: Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

1599
01:54:58,983 --> 01:55:00,364
[SPEAKER_04]: Mayor, 373 Riverside Ave.

1600
01:55:01,324 --> 01:55:06,687
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of you have actually met since 2017 when I moved in here, and there's been a lot of excitement on the corner of my street.

1601
01:55:06,747 --> 01:55:08,348
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a busy area, understand that.

1602
01:55:08,388 --> 01:55:10,369
[SPEAKER_04]: We now have Wegmans right at the Meadow Glen Mall.

1603
01:55:10,389 --> 01:55:18,693
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a car crash through my house the first year I came through here, so I kind of understand what it means when there's an emergency that happens, especially in the middle of the night that might wake you up.

1604
01:55:18,853 --> 01:55:22,555
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally, the foundation of my house shook, and there was like bricks flying from the house next door.

1605
01:55:23,616 --> 01:55:25,757
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you work here at Councilor Bears,

1606
01:55:27,528 --> 01:55:29,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it was kind of a disaster.

1607
01:55:30,750 --> 01:55:33,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt bad for the car too, actually, when I saw it.

1608
01:55:33,912 --> 01:55:38,375
[SPEAKER_04]: So that said, I do try to come here and not just complain, but also offer some solutions if we can.

1609
01:55:38,495 --> 01:55:39,696
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's really my goal.

1610
01:55:40,857 --> 01:55:42,097
[SPEAKER_04]: That said, I'm also now a dad.

1611
01:55:42,618 --> 01:55:44,679
[SPEAKER_04]: So since I've moved here, some things have changed.

1612
01:55:44,699 --> 01:55:47,341
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a 13-month-old son who's actually not feeling well tonight.

1613
01:55:47,441 --> 01:55:49,842
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to go home and probably have to take care of him.

1614
01:55:51,063 --> 01:55:56,306
[SPEAKER_04]: So definitely some shifting priorities, just like you, Mr. President, in terms of your age, mine also.

1615
01:55:57,067 --> 01:56:08,674
[SPEAKER_04]: So now that I have a newborn, a couple weeks ago, starting on October 20th, I put my kid to bed and around nine o'clock at night, all of a sudden it's like, all right, what's going on here?

1616
01:56:08,694 --> 01:56:09,835
[SPEAKER_04]: And in fact, I wasn't home.

1617
01:56:09,855 --> 01:56:12,756
[SPEAKER_04]: My wife put the kid to bed and I went to come in.

1618
01:56:12,796 --> 01:56:18,880
[SPEAKER_04]: I couldn't get in my own driveway because someone decided they were going to dig a hole in front of my house to go fix a gas leak.

1619
01:56:19,781 --> 01:56:20,141
[SPEAKER_04]: Excellent.

1620
01:56:20,749 --> 01:56:24,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for fixing gas leaks, especially when they need to be fixed.

1621
01:56:24,755 --> 01:56:27,659
[SPEAKER_04]: So no gripes with that, especially as it's approaching winter.

1622
01:56:28,380 --> 01:56:32,506
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's not try to fix gas leaks in the wintertime if we learned anything from the North Andover instance.

1623
01:56:33,126 --> 01:56:33,206
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.

1624
01:56:34,268 --> 01:56:36,792
[SPEAKER_04]: So that said, hey, how long would this take?

1625
01:56:37,782 --> 01:56:38,803
[SPEAKER_04]: No notice whatsoever.

1626
01:56:39,323 --> 01:56:41,824
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not the only resident that was like, oh, what's going on?

1627
01:56:41,865 --> 01:56:43,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't even know they were necessarily fixing a gas leak.

1628
01:56:43,766 --> 01:56:50,930
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got the giant national grid truck and they've been poking holes in that intersection for the past four years, chasing gas leaks here, there, everywhere.

1629
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:54,872
[SPEAKER_04]: So jackhammer in the middle of the night, right?

1630
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:58,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Going through the middle of the night to like three, four in the morning, what's going on?

1631
01:56:59,692 --> 01:57:09,300
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I came back the next night and said, hi, what's, you know, there's no one really to talk to, and I'm not going to go walk in a construction zone, but there are some nice police officers on both ends where they shut down the street.

1632
01:57:10,021 --> 01:57:11,442
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, I want to go home.

1633
01:57:11,502 --> 01:57:14,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do I put my car so I can get home?

1634
01:57:16,066 --> 01:57:18,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Not very good answers from one officer that asked it.

1635
01:57:18,688 --> 01:57:19,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry, I don't know.

1636
01:57:19,349 --> 01:57:20,490
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to go talk to someone and see.

1637
01:57:22,323 --> 01:57:24,244
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, someone hired you for the detail.

1638
01:57:24,724 --> 01:57:29,867
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know when they have these jobs that they list the details and who can sign up to actually work the road job.

1639
01:57:29,887 --> 01:57:31,468
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was kind of a poor answer.

1640
01:57:31,628 --> 01:57:33,729
[SPEAKER_04]: Didn't really like that one.

1641
01:57:34,209 --> 01:57:35,190
[SPEAKER_04]: So I tried to do some homework.

1642
01:57:35,210 --> 01:57:40,612
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually wrote an email eventually to, cause this lasted for like a week, Monday through Friday.

1643
01:57:40,793 --> 01:57:42,053
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's going on here?

1644
01:57:42,093 --> 01:57:45,975
[SPEAKER_04]: We're starting work at nine o'clock and it's wrapping up, you know, three, four in the morning.

1645
01:57:45,995 --> 01:57:47,136
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to keep the kid asleep.

1646
01:57:48,165 --> 01:57:49,987
[SPEAKER_04]: and my neighbors are asking, what's going on?

1647
01:57:50,367 --> 01:57:51,548
[SPEAKER_04]: None of us have any answers.

1648
01:57:52,368 --> 01:57:53,890
[SPEAKER_04]: So they stopped for the weekend.

1649
01:57:53,970 --> 01:57:54,730
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, they must be done.

1650
01:57:55,411 --> 01:57:57,613
[SPEAKER_04]: No, they started up Monday morning back at it.

1651
01:57:57,653 --> 01:58:03,277
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's when I, you know, send an email, asked the chief engineer McGivern, what's going on?

1652
01:58:04,138 --> 01:58:07,781
[SPEAKER_04]: And the answer I get is, oh, well, I don't approve anything during the day.

1653
01:58:07,841 --> 01:58:12,225
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have, you know, we'll do some homework, but you know, it's the chief of police.

1654
01:58:12,265 --> 01:58:13,065
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that chief Buckley?

1655
01:58:13,206 --> 01:58:13,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that right?

1656
01:58:14,066 --> 01:58:14,206
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1657
01:58:14,607 --> 01:58:14,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1658
01:58:15,547 --> 01:58:15,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So

1659
01:58:17,453 --> 01:58:21,035
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally get a response, oh, this is an emergency, it had to happen at night.

1660
01:58:22,196 --> 01:58:23,677
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an emergency, got it.

1661
01:58:23,937 --> 01:58:26,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Takes a week to fix an emergency for a gas leak.

1662
01:58:27,019 --> 01:58:29,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently takes two weeks, because that's how long this thing took.

1663
01:58:30,622 --> 01:58:32,903
[SPEAKER_04]: We couldn't give anyone in the neighborhood any notice.

1664
01:58:33,784 --> 01:58:38,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Couldn't find a slip in my mailbox, something on my door, right?

1665
01:58:38,487 --> 01:58:39,847
[SPEAKER_04]: I get those in the mail all the time.

1666
01:58:40,008 --> 01:58:41,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Those work fine, they come great.

1667
01:58:42,289 --> 01:58:44,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody could walk around and put something in there.

1668
01:58:46,066 --> 01:58:49,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's the person, the community person from National Grid that we contacted?

1669
01:58:49,889 --> 01:58:50,490
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan Cameron.

1670
01:58:50,870 --> 01:58:51,231
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1671
01:58:51,431 --> 01:58:52,952
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I spoke with Dan Cameron.

1672
01:58:53,032 --> 01:58:56,335
[SPEAKER_04]: He said, oh yeah, apparently, and he was nice, very nice, very cordial.

1673
01:58:57,055 --> 01:58:58,817
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently, there was a failure in communication.

1674
01:58:59,537 --> 01:59:02,059
[SPEAKER_04]: My point is, this isn't the first time this has happened.

1675
01:59:02,099 --> 01:59:10,205
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, in June of 2019, there was a sewer lining project on Locust Street that someone decided was a good idea to put a, you know,

1676
01:59:10,946 --> 01:59:18,010
[SPEAKER_04]: basically make a giant hissing noise for hours starting at 10 o'clock at night and they said, oh, we didn't realize it was going to make noise in the neighborhood.

1677
01:59:18,631 --> 01:59:19,772
[SPEAKER_04]: There's people that live there.

1678
01:59:19,812 --> 01:59:21,853
[SPEAKER_04]: There's people that get up in the morning to go to work.

1679
01:59:21,913 --> 01:59:23,814
[SPEAKER_04]: They have kids, they have, you know, so on and so forth.

1680
01:59:23,854 --> 01:59:24,895
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of residents.

1681
01:59:26,396 --> 01:59:34,201
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we need to do better, especially communicating if projects are going to happen at night, whether they're emergencies or not, we can put some signs out.

1682
01:59:34,841 --> 01:59:38,043
[SPEAKER_04]: And the mayor offered a solution that was, well,

1683
01:59:38,557 --> 01:59:41,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if National Grid doesn't, we'll send out a robocall.

1684
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:44,181
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to pick on you for a second, Councilor Falco.

1685
01:59:44,582 --> 01:59:45,222
[SPEAKER_04]: You have a cell phone?

1686
01:59:45,603 --> 01:59:46,223
[SPEAKER_09]: I do, right here.

1687
01:59:46,563 --> 01:59:46,864
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1688
01:59:47,184 --> 01:59:48,525
[SPEAKER_04]: So you get phone calls on it.

1689
01:59:48,905 --> 01:59:49,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1690
01:59:49,285 --> 01:59:50,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you get spam calls on your phone?

1691
01:59:50,907 --> 01:59:51,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1692
01:59:51,367 --> 01:59:53,949
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens when you get a phone number you don't recognize?

1693
01:59:54,129 --> 01:59:55,050
[SPEAKER_09]: You probably don't answer it.

1694
01:59:55,110 --> 01:59:56,571
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably don't answer it.

1695
01:59:56,611 --> 02:00:01,115
[SPEAKER_04]: So you think you're going to wind up necessarily hearing the phone call, the robocall?

1696
02:00:01,535 --> 02:00:02,776
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a good solution.

1697
02:00:04,183 --> 02:00:07,565
[SPEAKER_04]: And more so is when you go ask for, you know, where's the buck stop?

1698
02:00:07,705 --> 02:00:09,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Who approved these things at nighttime?

1699
02:00:09,867 --> 02:00:12,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Why do they have to happen in the middle of the night?

1700
02:00:12,549 --> 02:00:14,590
[SPEAKER_04]: I understand traffic can be an inconvenience.

1701
02:00:14,991 --> 02:00:15,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

1702
02:00:16,031 --> 02:00:17,492
[SPEAKER_04]: I drive around here too.

1703
02:00:17,772 --> 02:00:19,133
[SPEAKER_04]: Traffic's always an inconvenience.

1704
02:00:21,415 --> 02:00:28,760
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the policy in terms of like, how is that determination made besides it's easy for me to get a detail at night versus during the day?

1705
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:30,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe that's part of the calculus.

1706
02:00:30,942 --> 02:00:31,242
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1707
02:00:32,656 --> 02:00:39,545
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it would be nice if, you know, maybe this council could take a look at what that logic path is.

1708
02:00:40,386 --> 02:00:44,330
[SPEAKER_04]: When we start approving projects at night, didn't it generate some noise?

1709
02:00:44,370 --> 02:00:46,633
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know about you, but I would think it's a person.

1710
02:00:49,898 --> 02:00:50,598
[SPEAKER_02]: of vice president night.

1711
02:00:50,618 --> 02:00:59,023
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my understanding and when these applications come before us and we read through the application, um, and we, Oh, what are these councils behind this rail last every time?

1712
02:00:59,063 --> 02:00:59,983
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the hours of this project?

1713
02:01:00,063 --> 02:01:02,004
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the hours of construction?

1714
02:01:02,445 --> 02:01:03,445
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do the hours of construction.

1715
02:01:03,465 --> 02:01:09,809
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do construction whenever the city tells us to, whenever the city engineer, whenever the mayor's office tells us to, that's when we'll do it.

1716
02:01:10,729 --> 02:01:11,470
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when we'll do it.

1717
02:01:11,770 --> 02:01:17,873
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think what you're getting Nate, quite frankly, is, um, what's that song by blues traveler, the runaround.

1718
02:01:18,633 --> 02:01:19,815
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, very much so.

1719
02:01:19,855 --> 02:01:29,570
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everyone's pointing, you know, which way, which way the police chief, you know, at the end of the day, the administration determines when the construction is going to be authorized and allowed.

1720
02:01:29,851 --> 02:01:32,395
[SPEAKER_02]: It's outlined on the permit, the permits issued through the engineering office.

1721
02:01:33,794 --> 02:01:36,236
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, apparently, according to the engineer, he doesn't authorize the permit.

1722
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:40,180
[SPEAKER_04]: The police chief authorizes anything when they open the road at night and they do construction at night.

1723
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:43,604
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a street opening permit, so the police would have to be there for the detail.

1724
02:01:43,644 --> 02:01:44,525
[SPEAKER_02]: The police get the detail.

1725
02:01:44,865 --> 02:01:45,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

1726
02:01:45,265 --> 02:01:47,588
[SPEAKER_02]: So any road opening has to have the detail there.

1727
02:01:47,688 --> 02:01:50,310
[SPEAKER_02]: The city engineer signs off on any type of construction.

1728
02:01:50,811 --> 02:01:51,972
[SPEAKER_02]: The city engineer has to sign off.

1729
02:01:52,773 --> 02:01:54,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Chief, a police can't say, yeah, go open the street and do construction.

1730
02:01:55,356 --> 02:01:57,037
[SPEAKER_09]: We always ask the time, the duration.

1731
02:01:58,781 --> 02:02:00,442
[SPEAKER_09]: I never remember approving anything.

1732
02:02:00,943 --> 02:02:05,448
[SPEAKER_13]: We have an item on our emergency.

1733
02:02:05,508 --> 02:02:09,752
[SPEAKER_13]: This was a level one leak that they were aware of.

1734
02:02:09,772 --> 02:02:15,138
[SPEAKER_13]: Remember we had these discussions when they were talking about the MWRA project with National Grid?

1735
02:02:15,458 --> 02:02:15,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

1736
02:02:18,645 --> 02:02:25,373
[SPEAKER_13]: This was a level one leak and the chief made the determination not to do the work during the day, but he gave them approval to do it at night.

1737
02:02:25,913 --> 02:02:29,237
[SPEAKER_13]: So that's why there wasn't proper notification, but I agree.

1738
02:02:29,257 --> 02:02:30,899
[SPEAKER_13]: There should be some type of notification.

1739
02:02:31,099 --> 02:02:40,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and especially if it's going to go on, you know, it's supposed to happen a day or two and that like what defines an emergency is a two week project and emergency or is it two week project to project?

1740
02:02:40,429 --> 02:02:41,209
[SPEAKER_04]: And stuff happens.

1741
02:02:41,390 --> 02:02:43,351
[SPEAKER_02]: A level one gas leak is an emergency.

1742
02:02:43,611 --> 02:02:44,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Understood.

1743
02:02:44,231 --> 02:02:45,812
[SPEAKER_02]: A level one gas leak is an emergency.

1744
02:02:45,832 --> 02:02:46,873
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no question about that.

1745
02:02:47,013 --> 02:02:48,533
[SPEAKER_02]: A level one gas leak is an emergency.

1746
02:02:48,874 --> 02:02:56,678
[SPEAKER_02]: To take two weeks to fix it is a little crazy to me because if it's such an emergency, then shut the street down all day, get it done in a day.

1747
02:02:57,078 --> 02:02:57,618
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

1748
02:02:58,019 --> 02:02:58,919
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way I'd look at it.

1749
02:02:59,219 --> 02:03:00,520
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, I don't sit over there.

1750
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:01,180
[SPEAKER_02]: I sit over here.

1751
02:03:01,761 --> 02:03:09,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, so that's really not, you know, something that, that, that we can control or, or, or, or impact at the time.

1752
02:03:09,285 --> 02:03:09,765
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?

1753
02:03:10,599 --> 02:03:11,560
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just mismanagement.

1754
02:03:12,141 --> 02:03:17,889
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't mind, Mr. President, I just have a question.

1755
02:03:18,290 --> 02:03:21,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it one, are they digging in one area or are they moving around?

1756
02:03:22,015 --> 02:03:23,978
[SPEAKER_04]: So in this particular spot, it was one area.

1757
02:03:24,259 --> 02:03:24,519
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1758
02:03:24,579 --> 02:03:26,422
[SPEAKER_03]: And over two weeks, they're digging in the same spot.

1759
02:03:26,989 --> 02:03:32,773
[SPEAKER_04]: And they would dig and then cover it over for the traffic to go during the day and open it back up.

1760
02:03:32,793 --> 02:03:38,017
[SPEAKER_04]: So you actually have that lost time too, where it takes them a couple hours to open up the same hole and then cover it back over.

1761
02:03:38,317 --> 02:03:46,743
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you total those hours up over two weeks, let's say it's like two hours a day times 10 days, that's 20 hours, almost 24 hours worth of work.

1762
02:03:47,283 --> 02:03:49,184
[SPEAKER_04]: National grid says they'll work 24 seven.

1763
02:03:49,684 --> 02:03:50,965
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm with you Councilor Knight.

1764
02:03:51,205 --> 02:03:53,266
[SPEAKER_04]: If this is an emergency, fix it and get it done.

1765
02:03:53,686 --> 02:03:55,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't drag this out over two weeks.

1766
02:03:55,227 --> 02:03:57,908
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of you have heard plenty of complaints of residents.

1767
02:03:57,928 --> 02:04:04,832
[SPEAKER_04]: When you hear the airplanes flying overhead, when they're taking off runway three, three, you drag the FAA in here saying, Hey, it's too loud at night.

1768
02:04:04,872 --> 02:04:06,292
[SPEAKER_04]: It's waking up my kids, blah, blah, blah.

1769
02:04:06,733 --> 02:04:13,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I challenge you to then deal with someone with a jackhammer outside your house till four in the morning.

1770
02:04:14,082 --> 02:04:15,202
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to know some noise?

1771
02:04:15,642 --> 02:04:23,304
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, I can, you know, I have DB levels that I was measuring and talking about, you know, a thousand times sound that's, you know, happening.

1772
02:04:23,364 --> 02:04:24,244
[SPEAKER_04]: It's 30 DB, right?

1773
02:04:25,505 --> 02:04:30,446
[SPEAKER_04]: When they're wearing hearing protection, operating the equipment, it's not just the abutters.

1774
02:04:30,526 --> 02:04:35,067
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a magical line that sound then up, it only touches the property lines, sound travels.

1775
02:04:36,827 --> 02:04:40,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's why I think there's maybe we can look at the criteria.

1776
02:04:41,709 --> 02:04:42,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it was an emergency.

1777
02:04:43,790 --> 02:04:50,014
[SPEAKER_04]: But once it starts moving past a couple of days, maybe we're not in emergency territory in terms of how we get the work done.

1778
02:04:51,014 --> 02:04:53,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe then we take a look and go, hey, this is getting out of hand.

1779
02:04:53,856 --> 02:04:55,797
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't keep dragging this out over two weeks.

1780
02:04:55,857 --> 02:04:57,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's wrap it up and get it done.

1781
02:04:59,839 --> 02:05:10,525
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess my ask of you, is there something that we can do, pass a motion to revisit the logic tree of when work is done at night in this city versus during the day?

1782
02:05:14,268 --> 02:05:14,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I would hope so.

1783
02:05:14,969 --> 02:05:16,950
[SPEAKER_04]: And if not, I think that's a problem too.

1784
02:05:17,451 --> 02:05:20,813
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you guys don't know what that is, that's a problem.

1785
02:05:21,174 --> 02:05:31,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Murray, to be honest, we've had probably 10, 15 resolutions since I've been on the council asking, why isn't the Winthrop street project getting done?

1786
02:05:32,162 --> 02:05:34,584
[SPEAKER_03]: Why, you know, we've had issues around this, around this issue.

1787
02:05:35,125 --> 02:05:36,486
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we've pushed

1788
02:05:37,317 --> 02:05:38,459
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're bringing it to us again.

1789
02:05:38,479 --> 02:05:45,210
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure one of us, if not all seven of us, we want to put a motion on next week and say, what the heck is going on with this issue on Riverside Avenue?

1790
02:05:45,972 --> 02:05:47,274
[SPEAKER_03]: We have been saying to the police chief.

1791
02:05:48,073 --> 02:05:49,294
[SPEAKER_03]: We need Winthrop Street done this year.

1792
02:05:49,314 --> 02:05:50,594
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been torn up for five years.

1793
02:05:50,654 --> 02:05:52,055
[SPEAKER_03]: We need Mystic Ab done this year.

1794
02:05:52,075 --> 02:05:53,255
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been torn up for five years.

1795
02:05:53,875 --> 02:05:55,736
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's been delay, delay, delay.

1796
02:05:55,836 --> 02:05:58,117
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just talking about the Brooks School.

1797
02:05:58,197 --> 02:06:02,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are we having these projects not coordinated?

1798
02:06:02,359 --> 02:06:06,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Or in this specific case, why is it starting the day that school starts?

1799
02:06:06,381 --> 02:06:11,843
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had an issue at Medford High School where there were projects going on as the morning rush was trying to get into Medford High School.

1800
02:06:15,004 --> 02:06:15,565
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm hearing you.

1801
02:06:15,645 --> 02:06:16,365
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree with you.

1802
02:06:16,405 --> 02:06:18,367
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we've been pushing on this issue citywide.

1803
02:06:18,768 --> 02:06:27,516
[SPEAKER_03]: And after saying all of that, my caveat here is when we ask, sometimes we don't get an answer and sometimes we don't get the answer we want to hear.

1804
02:06:27,776 --> 02:06:32,560
[SPEAKER_03]: And unless someone wants to correct me, we can't order them to do it.

1805
02:06:33,301 --> 02:06:35,103
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think

1806
02:06:36,605 --> 02:06:45,530
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to speak for everybody else, but I think we will try to get answers here and try to make this solution, find a solution to make this better, or at least better next time.

1807
02:06:46,771 --> 02:06:52,775
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have been asking those questions and had a very difficult time getting those solutions on promptly.

1808
02:06:52,835 --> 02:06:54,235
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to be honest with you about that.

1809
02:06:54,376 --> 02:06:54,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.

1810
02:06:54,836 --> 02:07:05,042
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said, I'm sure there's rhyme or reason, but you know, sometimes things change and it's good if we can understand and we can communicate what is that decision logic?

1811
02:07:08,698 --> 02:07:20,322
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. President, this is probably an ideal time because, Nate, you're probably aware there's going to be a major project done there relatively soon.

1812
02:07:20,382 --> 02:07:21,862
[SPEAKER_13]: With the MWRA and all that?

1813
02:07:22,082 --> 02:07:24,303
[SPEAKER_13]: A major, major project that's already been approved.

1814
02:07:24,363 --> 02:07:29,044
[SPEAKER_13]: So you're talking close to, I think, six, I think it was three to six months.

1815
02:07:29,244 --> 02:07:30,445
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't approved that actually.

1816
02:07:30,465 --> 02:07:31,385
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still on the table.

1817
02:07:32,509 --> 02:07:33,489
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, I don't know.

1818
02:07:33,849 --> 02:07:35,170
[SPEAKER_04]: They tried to do that last winter.

1819
02:07:35,810 --> 02:07:36,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, right.

1820
02:07:36,410 --> 02:07:39,530
[SPEAKER_04]: And we said, that's probably not a good idea to play with gas lines in the winter.

1821
02:07:39,710 --> 02:07:40,831
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, we asked them to hold off.

1822
02:07:41,191 --> 02:07:43,671
[SPEAKER_13]: They wanted to do it before Christmas, and we asked them to hold off.

1823
02:07:43,711 --> 02:07:45,171
[SPEAKER_13]: But it is going to happen.

1824
02:07:45,291 --> 02:07:49,352
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a major infrastructure improvement that they're making.

1825
02:07:49,412 --> 02:07:51,553
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's when they told us about the level one gas leaks.

1826
02:07:51,973 --> 02:07:57,854
[SPEAKER_13]: But I just want to say, Mr. President, when Nate reached out to me, I reached out to Dan Cameron immediately from National Grid.

1827
02:07:58,454 --> 02:07:59,715
[SPEAKER_13]: And he was very attentive.

1828
02:08:00,116 --> 02:08:02,398
[SPEAKER_13]: He addresses the issues immediately.

1829
02:08:02,438 --> 02:08:08,084
[SPEAKER_13]: It may not have been the answer that we wanted, but he immediately responded.

1830
02:08:08,104 --> 02:08:09,745
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just want to thank Dan Kiff.

1831
02:08:09,845 --> 02:08:10,266
[SPEAKER_04]: And he did.

1832
02:08:10,286 --> 02:08:13,108
[SPEAKER_04]: And he owned up and said, you know, they could have done a better job.

1833
02:08:13,249 --> 02:08:14,590
[SPEAKER_04]: So totally agree.

1834
02:08:16,249 --> 02:08:23,491
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, and in terms of coordination, if you're going to rip open the street again, well, don't pave over Riverside Ave anytime soon until they do that.

1835
02:08:23,931 --> 02:08:29,773
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's like a war zone there anyways, but, but at least save some money and not let, you know, pave it over and then rip it up again.

1836
02:08:33,654 --> 02:08:38,075
[SPEAKER_11]: We talked about earlier, just paving brand new streets and ripping them up two days after they were laid down.

1837
02:08:38,895 --> 02:08:48,586
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'll tell you what, if you want to take all the granite curbs and pull them out and give them to the, well, I was going to say they're useless where I am anyways, because there's no curbing left.

1838
02:08:48,646 --> 02:08:50,588
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a whole nother thing that needs to happen there.

1839
02:08:50,949 --> 02:08:56,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Take the granite curbs, give them to the gentleman that was talking two weeks ago that was saying, Hey, I need some granite curbs because they're useless to us.

1840
02:08:57,900 --> 02:09:04,925
[SPEAKER_04]: and then fix the street right after they do the National Grid project, but just don't play with our gas in the wintertime when we depend on it for our heat.

1841
02:09:05,285 --> 02:09:10,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Because God forbid something goes wrong, you're not running gas lines up on the street.

1842
02:09:10,910 --> 02:09:15,093
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, I'm coming to bunk in with one of you and my family so we can stay warm in the winter.

1843
02:09:15,153 --> 02:09:16,454
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of you better sign up.

1844
02:09:17,354 --> 02:09:19,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Zap, love it.

1845
02:09:19,476 --> 02:09:21,798
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I live in the smallest house of anyone here.

1846
02:09:24,720 --> 02:09:25,821
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you for your time.

1847
02:09:26,501 --> 02:09:26,981
