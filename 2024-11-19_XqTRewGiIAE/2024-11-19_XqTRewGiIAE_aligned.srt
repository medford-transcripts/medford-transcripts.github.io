President carry all yes, 7 affirmative motion passes.

36
00:01:05,741 --> 00:01:06,362
I was a night.

37
00:01:07,503 --> 00:01:15,067
To our existing billboard before us this evening it was tabled for a couple weeks and I'm hoping we can pick that matter up.

38
00:01:15,568 --> 00:01:17,009
It's a paper to one.

39
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:30,285
2, 1, 5, 6, 8, petition to reverse I don't know about you know I'm out of a clear channel to to do 6 missus Avenue that the best we've heard that I don't need a city rule.

40
00:01:32,786 --> 00:01:37,828
I think I see you know I'm out of here you know.

41
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:42,710
I was the president carry all members of the council on if I may can I share my screen.

42
00:01:43,872 --> 00:01:46,973
If you, if you can hang on a second, I'll let you, I'll let you in.

43
00:01:46,993 --> 00:01:47,613
Hold on a second.

44
00:01:47,633 --> 00:01:49,214
He'll let you do that.

45
00:01:49,234 --> 00:02:01,539
You should be all set.

46
00:02:02,639 --> 00:02:02,859
Okay.

47
00:02:02,899 --> 00:02:03,699
So you should be all set.

48
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,520
Perfect.

49
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:08,981
Can you guys see?

50
00:02:11,262 --> 00:02:11,742
Yes, we can.

51
00:02:11,762 --> 00:02:13,463
Okay.

52
00:02:16,218 --> 00:02:16,518
All right.

53
00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:17,038
Good evening.

54
00:02:17,118 --> 00:02:26,260
My name is John Omar with clear channel outdoor and we have a project going on at 2.36 to 2.40 mystic Avenue.

55
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,421
Mister Ron Roberto which I think he is present in the crowd tonight.

56
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:37,722
We have been a tenant here for Mister Roberto for just over 16 years.

57
00:02:39,002 --> 00:02:40,502
And he had approached us recently.

58
00:02:40,522 --> 00:02:45,063
Over the past couple years is having an issue.

59
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:48,449
with his parking lot with the weather coming in the snow.

60
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,912
He's not getting proper drainage for his tenant.

61
00:02:54,832 --> 00:03:14,463
So he had come to us to see if there's anything we could do with the sign to move in to help him out as the drainage isn't really isn't really working out for him and you'd like to see if he could you know if he can fix his own and we could possibly move the sign.

62
00:03:15,213 --> 00:03:19,236
So he had asked us to move the sign 15 feet to the south of the property.

63
00:03:20,497 --> 00:03:32,326
Hopefully that will allow him to fix his parking lot to alleviate you know the drainage issues improve snow removal and improve parking for his her rental car tenant.

64
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:44,315
We would like to proceed to see if we can move this sign and convert

65
00:03:45,699 --> 00:03:52,624
upgrade the site to digital which we do have 2 of the signs within the city north and south of the billboard.

66
00:03:54,065 --> 00:03:59,668
As prior agreements we have we give the city 7 hours of public service messaging per month on each face.

67
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,331
15 hours of public service and mask on which they receive.

68
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:11,376
The city would get 25,000 per year linkage fee for the life of the lease.

69
00:04:12,088 --> 00:04:16,449
So however long the lease is there, the city will get $25,000 per year.

70
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:20,611
The sign does go dark from 11 p.m.

71
00:04:20,651 --> 00:04:26,813
to 5 a.m., so as people are aware, the signs do just completely shut off, turn back on at 5 a.m.

72
00:04:28,213 --> 00:04:35,996
And then if we are approved by council tonight, we'll enter into another development agreement with the city of Medford with the above terms.

73
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:39,217
And in the past,

74
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:49,888
You know these billboards they can be used for public service announcements whether amber alerts FBI bulletins emergency response programs.

75
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,751
In the city does take advantage.

76
00:04:54,413 --> 00:05:01,501
The public service advertising in the past is what's been advertised on these billboards for the city.

77
00:05:13,524 --> 00:05:21,112
So we have basically seeking permission to move the sign 15 feet salt and convert this to a digital.

78
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:22,914
Upgraded to digital.

79
00:05:26,017 --> 00:05:27,519
It was a night.

80
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,321
I'm very familiar with this parcel of land.

81
00:05:31,341 --> 00:05:36,145
I'm very familiar with the billboard agreement that the city has with clear channel.

82
00:05:36,485 --> 00:05:40,489
It's not something that's negotiated by the city council the terms of the agreement of the terms of the agreement.

83
00:05:40,969 --> 00:05:51,617
I think really the issue that's before us this evening is whether or not we're going to reverse the sign denial because of the denial that was issued by the building commissioner because it falls out of the scope of our sign ordinance.

84
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:58,851
This billboard has always fallen outside the scope of our signed ordinance because it was part of a program that was negotiated with the state.

85
00:05:59,912 --> 00:06:09,134
In order to allow the property owner to get the necessary relief that he needs to make his parcel more accessible and more developable, I think it makes sense for us to approve this measure this evening, Mr. President.

86
00:06:09,694 --> 00:06:18,997
The way that I look at this is we're addressing an environmental concern relative to the runoff and leakage and drainage problems that we have at the gentleman's parcel, and we're also getting upgrades

87
00:06:19,957 --> 00:06:22,398
to the existing billboard to make it more environmentally friendly.

88
00:06:23,118 --> 00:06:25,759
The transfer, it's going to help us out with light pollution and the like.

89
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,461
So I think that this is a measure, Mr. President, that's a win-win for all.

90
00:06:30,101 --> 00:06:32,622
It allows the property owner to get the necessary relief that he needs.

91
00:06:32,702 --> 00:06:44,626
It allows Clear Channel the opportunity to upgrade their existing equipment, and it allows us here in the city of Medford to have some of the best, state-of-the-art, most up-to-date equipment to utilize through public service programs that they have.

92
00:06:45,206 --> 00:06:49,568
So I, for one, certainly feel as though this is a measure that the council should be approving, and I will move for approval.

93
00:06:52,061 --> 00:06:52,682
Thank you.

94
00:06:53,563 --> 00:06:53,803
Thank you.

95
00:06:53,823 --> 00:06:55,664
Mister president, I just have a few questions.

96
00:06:56,906 --> 00:07:05,092
So the plan is that the sign would move 15 feet and then the property owner would do whatever additional work they need to do to improve drainage.

97
00:07:05,112 --> 00:07:06,634
You guys are simply just moving the sign.

98
00:07:06,654 --> 00:07:07,775
You're not doing anything else.

99
00:07:08,736 --> 00:07:17,503
No, we're just moving the sign and the property owner can handle the drainage himself and do what he has to do to the city and get the necessary permits to do so.

100
00:07:19,445 --> 00:07:19,985
Okay, thank you.

101
00:07:20,045 --> 00:07:25,167
And vice president, I just alluded that, um, the illumination would be different.

102
00:07:25,187 --> 00:07:30,668
It would actually be lower and less disruptive with the led, the digital billboard, as opposed to the current illuminated one.

103
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,569
Can you, is that correct?

104
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:34,870
Uh, that is correct.

105
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:37,651
So the electronic billboards are monitored by the state.

106
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:40,091
Um, I believe that measured in NITS.

107
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:48,634
So the state does monitor the brightness of, um, the billboards and with new technology today, um, if the signs are too bright,

108
00:07:49,348 --> 00:08:01,117
They have a sensor in it that automatically brings them back down to the proper brightness.

109
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,921
Do you know how close this is to the other digital billboard?

110
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:07,743
I don't know.

111
00:08:07,783 --> 00:08:10,044
The other digital billboard, it should be well over 1,100 feet.

112
00:08:10,064 --> 00:08:10,104
OK.

113
00:08:10,144 --> 00:08:11,085
So relatively close.

114
00:08:19,102 --> 00:08:20,162
Okay, that's all I have right now.

115
00:08:20,202 --> 00:08:21,723
Thank you.

116
00:08:23,263 --> 00:08:24,264
Thank you, Mr. President.

117
00:08:24,724 --> 00:08:43,270
And, um, just for a little bit of, uh, background on this, I actually sat on the council when there was a pushback some 16, 17 years ago, uh, to consolidate the number of billboards that existed throughout the community.

118
00:08:44,427 --> 00:08:48,910
and many of which abutted neighborhoods, uh, as we all are aware.

119
00:08:49,551 --> 00:09:00,099
And the push back then was to kind of centrally focus, uh, the billboards along 93 and take them out of the neighborhood areas.

120
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:08,285
And I believe the agreement that was passed some years ago was very successful in taking out some of that blight in our neighborhoods.

121
00:09:08,883 --> 00:09:21,728
And at the time, residents were very happy with the agreement that was struck by then Mayor McGlynn and some of the big billboard advertising companies at the time.

122
00:09:23,609 --> 00:09:27,751
Ron Roberto has been in this community for a hundred years.

123
00:09:28,955 --> 00:09:34,637
I know you're not that old, Ron, but he's been an establishment in this community for 100 years, Mr. President.

124
00:09:34,957 --> 00:09:37,218
He's been a tremendous business owner.

125
00:09:38,018 --> 00:09:51,142
He's been a tremendous advocate for social service programs in our community and someone that I look up to, Mr. President, as a business leader in our community.

126
00:09:51,942 --> 00:09:53,923
So I just want that to be known, Mr. President.

127
00:09:54,303 --> 00:10:02,610
The question I had to Mr. Yano, he mentioned the $25,000 in linkage and seven hours of public service messages.

128
00:10:03,450 --> 00:10:08,674
I was just wondering, does that differ from the current agreement that is in place now?

129
00:10:10,476 --> 00:10:15,700
Yes, we went into another separate agreement, another agreement with the town.

130
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:17,993
Okay.

131
00:10:18,013 --> 00:10:24,117
So, so, uh, can you state what the original agreement is and when does that, was that a 20 year agreement?

132
00:10:24,197 --> 00:10:24,997
And when does that end?

133
00:10:26,298 --> 00:10:28,760
Uh, so basically it's, it's the life of the lease.

134
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:34,363
So currently we'll have, we have a 25 year extension on the Bilbo lease with Mr. Roberto.

135
00:10:34,843 --> 00:10:38,425
So for at least another 25 years, it's 25 K each year.

136
00:10:40,547 --> 00:10:44,569
So the current lease was for how long with Mr. Roberto?

137
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:45,830
Yes.

138
00:10:47,259 --> 00:10:50,142
I think that expires in five years.

139
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:54,345
So that expires in five years.

140
00:10:54,385 --> 00:11:00,530
So when you talk about the $25,000 linkage, is it just for this sign or is it for other signs included?

141
00:11:01,631 --> 00:11:02,552
It's just for this sign.

142
00:11:02,952 --> 00:11:06,275
The other signs are already included in a development agreement with the city.

143
00:11:07,316 --> 00:11:07,516
Right.

144
00:11:09,658 --> 00:11:15,983
So the seven hours of public service is in addition to hours that are being done right now.

145
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:16,879
Correct.

146
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,622
In addition, in another 25 K on top of the other agreement.

147
00:11:21,543 --> 00:11:21,663
Right.

148
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:28,809
Are you able to tell us how many public service hours have been messaged on that board since its inception?

149
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:37,796
I don't have that off the top of my head, but, um, you know, in prior slides that I did show, let me see if I can show these again.

150
00:11:38,637 --> 00:11:41,759
Um, I mean, it does look like the city does take advantage of it.

151
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,163
Um, here's at least six, I'd say probably within the last,

152
00:11:46,877 --> 00:11:49,159
you know 6 months.

153
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,324
And then here's another another 6 that were used.

154
00:11:53,964 --> 00:11:54,785
So the city does.

155
00:11:54,805 --> 00:11:58,209
You know take advantage of the usage.

156
00:12:00,523 --> 00:12:10,927
Mr. Clerk, Mr. President, as part of this report, I would ask that we receive an update on the public service messages that are going out by the city.

157
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:27,112
I want to make sure if they're allotting, it's a very expensive endeavor if anyone ever put something up on a billboard, and I want to make sure that we're using it to benefit our local civic groups as well as our sports teams and any other messaging, Mr. President.

158
00:12:27,132 --> 00:12:29,753
So I want to make sure that we're taking full advantage of that.

159
00:12:30,213 --> 00:12:35,276
I have, as my colleague stated, I have no problem upgrading to a digital board.

160
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:40,918
You know, that's the wave of technology, and it's the latest and greatest.

161
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:56,026
The illuminants are less than what's out there now, so that's always been a concern with the Butters and neighborhood, and the fact that it's gonna be shut off after, did you say 11, Mr. Yano?

162
00:12:56,406 --> 00:12:57,527
Yeah, they go dark from 11 to 5 a.m.

163
00:12:59,763 --> 00:13:00,483
11 to 5 a.m.

164
00:13:00,784 --> 00:13:08,806
The city does not pay for a nickel of the electricity that's paid by the property owner, and we get $25,000 in linkage.

165
00:13:08,826 --> 00:13:12,528
So to me, this is a win-win, Mr. President, and I will support it tonight.

166
00:13:12,548 --> 00:13:12,868
Thank you.

167
00:13:12,988 --> 00:13:14,128
Thank you.

168
00:13:14,388 --> 00:13:15,169
Thank you, Mr. President.

169
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:17,710
I want to thank Yano for the presentation.

170
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:19,650
Yano, could you show us slide number four again?

171
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,551
Sure.

172
00:13:20,571 --> 00:13:20,671
Yeah.

173
00:13:23,632 --> 00:13:24,972
Can you see it?

174
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:27,273
No.

175
00:13:30,658 --> 00:13:33,139
I think it was the slide with all the community benefits.

176
00:13:33,239 --> 00:13:34,580
I just want to look at that one more time.

177
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,761
I missed the last one, I think.

178
00:13:36,961 --> 00:13:41,784
I think you need to reshare your screen, because we're not seeing anything.

179
00:13:41,804 --> 00:13:42,304
OK, one second.

180
00:13:49,648 --> 00:13:50,148
All right.

181
00:13:51,469 --> 00:13:52,049
Can you see that?

182
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:53,750
Yes.

183
00:14:06,726 --> 00:14:08,846
Uh, point that was the, uh, bullet number.

184
00:14:08,886 --> 00:14:09,767
I went to five.

185
00:14:09,787 --> 00:14:12,287
Let's get cut off at the end and sure.

186
00:14:12,307 --> 00:14:13,467
Make sure I can see the whole thing.

187
00:14:14,668 --> 00:14:15,768
If you want to read it, that's fine.

188
00:14:17,088 --> 00:14:18,929
Bulletproof bullet point five.

189
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:25,050
If approved by city council, CCO will enter into another development agreement with the city of Medford with the above terms.

190
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:26,690
Okay.

191
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:27,310
All right.

192
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:28,851
That's all I wanted to see.

193
00:14:28,971 --> 00:14:29,671
Perfect.

194
00:14:29,691 --> 00:14:30,391
Uh, thank you so much.

195
00:14:30,511 --> 00:14:30,971
Appreciate it.

196
00:14:33,278 --> 00:14:33,999
Any further questions?

197
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:42,507

All right, so, we have delete existing ordinance.

224
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:12,081
The intent is to delete the entire existing ordinance.

231
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:55,937
I'll go 6 site plan review.

We've been placed with section 6.0 general regulations.

I'll go seven development linkage fees to be replaced with section 7.0 special regulations.

The full proposed zoning recodification is available for view in the city clerk's office and online at DriveGoogle.com dash folders.

Or call 781-393-2425 for any accommodations.

246
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:17,472
Do we have any questions on

247
00:18:19,373 --> 00:18:19,914
the hearing yet.

248
00:18:21,135 --> 00:18:21,856
What is the hearing?

249
00:18:21,876 --> 00:18:23,958
We have anybody in favor of this?

250
00:18:26,101 --> 00:18:30,966
Mr. President, motion to continue the public hearing and refer the paper to the Community Development Board.

251
00:18:31,006 --> 00:18:37,354
The motion by Vice President Knight to refer the paper to continue the hearing to the Community Development Board.

252
00:18:37,754 --> 00:18:38,315
Mr. President.

253
00:18:39,772 --> 00:18:40,932
Councilor Marks.

254
00:18:41,212 --> 00:18:42,193
Thank you, Mr. President.

255
00:18:42,233 --> 00:18:43,953
I want to thank my colleagues.

256
00:18:44,013 --> 00:18:50,675
This has been a long arduous process over the last year and a half.

257
00:18:52,295 --> 00:18:58,297
Countless meetings, hundreds of hours, Mr. President, meetings, the hiring of a consultant.

258
00:18:59,797 --> 00:19:04,198
And I believe what we have now is a good working document.

259
00:19:04,923 --> 00:19:08,686
One in which requires additional stakeholder input.

260
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:17,793
Um, and that is going to take place over a period of time with the offices of the community development board, as well as what this method city council.

261
00:19:18,193 --> 00:19:21,396
So there's much room for discussion and change.

262
00:19:21,796 --> 00:19:25,639
This was a starter document that we put together.

263
00:19:25,659 --> 00:19:30,863
Uh, it hasn't been looked at in probably 30 something years, the zoning in our community.

264
00:19:30,923 --> 00:19:31,043
So,

265
00:19:31,483 --> 00:19:32,404
It was long overdue.

266
00:19:32,844 --> 00:19:43,572
The one request I would have, Mr. President, and I've had a number of residents reach out to me asking me to summarize the major changes, um, in this particular document.

267
00:19:44,072 --> 00:19:47,214
And I know we have a red line, the blue line copy.

268
00:19:47,935 --> 00:19:56,141
And, uh, unless you've been working with this document, uh, for the past year and a half, um, to me, it's zoning is pretty complex.

269
00:19:56,701 --> 00:20:01,323
I think it's one of the most complex issues that I've had to deal with at my tenure on the council.

270
00:20:02,064 --> 00:20:14,549
And at this point, I would ask that if we go back to our consultant and see if he can put together a brief summary of the major changes.

271
00:20:15,089 --> 00:20:23,053
There was a lot of technical changes, and I don't think at this point the technical changes we have to summarize, but the major changes

272
00:20:23,983 --> 00:20:40,508
uh, that, uh, you know, and I, and I guess that's open for interpretation, but the major changes to this, Mr. President, if he could put together just a brief summary, so residents can look at it rather than going through a hundred page document, uh, look at it and say, okay, this is impacted.

273
00:20:40,528 --> 00:20:41,268
That's impacted.

274
00:20:41,588 --> 00:20:42,028
I agree.

275
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:42,709
I don't agree.

276
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:44,289
I should research this further.

277
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:45,990
I don't need to research it further.

278
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,410
Um, and at least,

279
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:50,192
uh, give them a starting point.

280
00:20:50,972 --> 00:20:57,336
Uh, you know, we've all sat through hundreds of hours meetings, uh, and most residents haven't had that opportunity.

281
00:20:57,876 --> 00:21:02,800
Uh, no, what I say, they should, uh, you know, uh, have been that involved.

282
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,860
That's why they elect us.

283
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:09,644
But, uh, it's important that, uh, they have a thumbnail cursory of what transpired

284
00:21:10,344 --> 00:21:13,266
through this work of this council over the last year and a half.

285
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:21,592
So I would respectfully ask that be part of Council Vice President Knight's paper to move this forward to the community development.

286
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:22,853
Thank you, Mr. President.

287
00:21:22,913 --> 00:21:24,054
Thank you, Mr. President.

288
00:21:25,355 --> 00:21:26,636
If I could further amend that.

289
00:21:26,816 --> 00:21:27,317
Oh, sorry.

290
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:30,799
You can go ahead.

291
00:21:31,199 --> 00:21:33,301
I'm sorry.

292
00:21:33,361 --> 00:21:34,242
I'll just go really quickly.

293
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:40,083
If we could post the red line copy online, as well as the summary when we get it.

294
00:21:40,183 --> 00:21:41,964
And I, I'm totally in agreement with you.

295
00:21:42,084 --> 00:21:45,666
I think we might've asked Mr. Brodsky to do that at the committee of the whole meeting.

296
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:48,428
So it should be, maybe it's to be done more quickly.

297
00:21:48,508 --> 00:21:51,790
So I'm hoping that both of those can be posted online.

298
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,210
That's it.

299
00:21:52,390 --> 00:21:52,711
Thank you.

300
00:21:53,131 --> 00:21:53,391
Thank you.

301
00:21:55,255 --> 00:21:55,895
Thank you, Mr. President.

302
00:21:56,335 --> 00:22:03,017
I want to thank Councilor Marks for his words and just echo what he said in that this moving to the Community Development Board is just another step in the feedback process.

303
00:22:03,477 --> 00:22:08,538
There's a lot of time for more stakeholder input, citizen resident input.

304
00:22:08,638 --> 00:22:10,079
This isn't us rubber stamping it.

305
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:12,959
This is us just moving into the next process of engagement.

306
00:22:12,979 --> 00:22:14,180
And I just want to make that clear.

307
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:14,720
Yes.

308
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,000
Thank you.

309
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:16,881
Thank you, Mr. President.

310
00:22:16,901 --> 00:22:21,145
I just want to thank all my colleagues for all their help with this.

311
00:22:21,446 --> 00:22:23,327
This actually has been a long process.

312
00:22:24,268 --> 00:22:28,653
Like Counselor Moxley mentioned, at least a year and a half that we've gone through this year.

313
00:22:28,673 --> 00:22:30,715
A lot of meetings, great team effort.

314
00:22:30,775 --> 00:22:33,338
We're not done, but this is a major

315
00:22:35,853 --> 00:22:38,593
major piece of the process, passing it on to the CD board.

316
00:22:38,814 --> 00:22:52,236
And I believe Mark Obrosky is working on that document, which is definitely something that will benefit everyone that wants to look at the changes that we made.

317
00:22:52,296 --> 00:22:59,757
But this has been a great team effort, and I look to definitely work towards a finished product.

318
00:22:59,797 --> 00:23:04,758
We're going to be better for it in the end, and well worth the time and effort that we've put into it.

319
00:23:04,798 --> 00:23:05,318
So thank you.

320
00:23:06,555 --> 00:23:06,815
Thank you.

321
00:23:06,835 --> 00:23:10,177
And again, uh, this was a, this was a long process.

322
00:23:11,038 --> 00:23:22,144
Um, and again, I, I, I'm, uh, very happy that we, uh, I had, uh, Mr. Burkowski, he's probably the foremost authority on zoning in the, in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

323
00:23:22,224 --> 00:23:26,066
And, uh, he will be presenting this, uh, to the OCD board.

324
00:23:26,647 --> 00:23:32,450
And I'd like to, um, hopefully with, uh, after this is done, I'd like to have him come back and actually help

325
00:23:33,923 --> 00:23:35,845
with the actual zoning of the city.

326
00:23:36,365 --> 00:23:40,048
I mean, his expertise is really second to none.

327
00:23:40,608 --> 00:23:48,895
So I say, after this is done, we can have a discussion on this, but I'd like to have him come back and help out further.

328
00:23:50,816 --> 00:24:00,984
On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Baez, and amended by Councilor Mox.

329
00:24:02,044 --> 00:24:02,825
Did I miss anybody?

330
00:24:04,261 --> 00:24:05,462
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

331
00:24:05,482 --> 00:24:08,824
Yes.

332
00:24:08,844 --> 00:24:08,924
Yes.

333
00:24:08,944 --> 00:24:09,224
Yes.

334
00:24:09,684 --> 00:24:09,864
Yes.

335
00:24:19,722 --> 00:24:21,603
Yes, some affirmative motion passes.

336
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:37,631
Well, motions, orders and resolutions 21527 offered by Councilor Scott Peli be a result of the City Council get a report from the city engineer in the administration of street openings in the final paving of those projects with dates of paving completion over the last over the past five years.

337
00:24:37,651 --> 00:24:38,391
Councilor Scott Peli.

338
00:24:39,532 --> 00:24:40,552
Thank you, Mr. President.

339
00:24:41,493 --> 00:24:44,154
First of all, I know that mom had her

340
00:24:44,936 --> 00:24:59,635
her funeral today and I just want to thank everybody that's on the council that supported my family and and and understand the reason why I'm not there this evening but I just I want to just make sure that as we're

341
00:25:00,188 --> 00:25:26,277
This is something I presented a few weeks back that was being held off, and I appreciate to bring this forward this evening, but if we could just get a report from the city administration, the engineer's office, that we can look back at some of the projects that we've done that have been performed by, especially our utility companies, and if the projects were successful,

342
00:25:27,937 --> 00:25:36,679
brought back to what we request every time that the openings are at the same or better condition.

343
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:44,781
So if we can get just a simple list and what has been done so I can check.

344
00:25:44,841 --> 00:25:45,541
It's not just one.

345
00:25:45,581 --> 00:25:50,142
The problem is there's probably about 15 to 16 that people have contacted me on.

346
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:53,983
So if we can get that, that'd be greatly appreciated.

347
00:25:54,003 --> 00:25:55,743
Thank you.

348
00:25:57,315 --> 00:26:00,997
On the motion by Councilor Scott Pelli, seconded by Councilor Falco.

349
00:26:02,037 --> 00:26:02,698

00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:34,120
Councilor Scott Pelley.

369
00:26:35,822 --> 00:26:37,743
Thank you, Council President.

370
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:55,396
Mr. Thorde was a longtime Methodist resident who lost his life in battles with cancer, and a very important person in my life was

371
00:26:55,950 --> 00:27:02,095
one of the first people to volunteer and call and help my run in the school committee years ago.

372
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:14,665
And I graduated with a son, Scott, and a longtime Meffitt family, and I just wanna send sincere condolences and well wishes to the family.

373
00:27:15,285 --> 00:27:15,645
Thank you.

Yes.

388
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:34,540
Councilor Stark-Kelley?

389
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,260
Yes.

390
00:27:36,441 --> 00:27:38,803
Hereby I'll- Yes, seven in the affirmative, motion passes.

391
00:27:39,383 --> 00:27:51,131
21575 offered by Vice President Knight, be it resolved that the administration notify residents via reverse 911 call, inform them of these 5G facilities that have been approved.

392
00:27:51,652 --> 00:27:55,094
Zero Gourley Road, Zero West Street, 24 Pearl Street, 26 Royal Street,

393
00:27:57,295 --> 00:28:10,683
48 Clark Street, 40 Ashland Street, 12 Fulton Street, 23 Woodrow Ave, 123 Grant Ave, 0 Logan Ave, 0 Brookside Parkway, 83 Washington Street, 39 Charnwood Road, and 163 Forest Street.

394
00:28:11,083 --> 00:28:11,824
Vice President Knight.

395
00:28:12,304 --> 00:28:13,845
Mr. President, thank you very much.

396
00:28:13,885 --> 00:28:20,989
As we're all aware, if we've been paying attention to what's going on in this community, as of recent, the issue of 5G technology was certainly a concern.

397
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:21,329
Skip one.

398
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:22,510
Skip one.

399
00:28:24,291 --> 00:28:25,552
Which was 0 Goley Road.

400
00:28:27,082 --> 00:28:27,382
No, no.

401
00:28:27,482 --> 00:28:27,922
Oh, he skipped.

402
00:28:28,142 --> 00:28:28,823
Oh, he skipped.

403
00:28:29,223 --> 00:28:29,583
I'm sorry.

404
00:28:29,603 --> 00:28:34,345
We can jump back to it.

405
00:28:34,605 --> 00:28:38,767
Mr. President, why don't we get council Scott Pelley's items out of the way.

406
00:28:38,827 --> 00:28:42,568
Is that a long time?

407
00:28:43,248 --> 00:28:50,391
Ultimately, Mr. President, the issue of 5g facilities in this community has been a topic of discussion and concern.

408
00:28:50,411 --> 00:28:52,072
There are many individuals in this community.

409
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:56,390
that have expressed some concern about 5G technology and the placement thereof.

410
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:07,354
Recently, the city's ad hoc small cell committee has approved 17 5G towers to be located in the city of Medford.

411
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:21,238
And I just want to be sure that the residents that are going to be abutting these 5G towers are notified of the circumstance that the approval has been awarded and whether or not there are any appeals processes for these abutters should they wish to pursue them.

412
00:29:21,878 --> 00:29:24,281
So that's the resolution in a nutshell, Mr. President.

413
00:29:24,901 --> 00:29:28,125
On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by?

414
00:29:28,505 --> 00:29:28,825
Second.

415
00:29:29,346 --> 00:29:30,487
Seconded by Councilor Marks.

416
00:29:31,188 --> 00:29:32,409
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

417
00:29:34,391 --> 00:29:34,931
Councilor Paris?

418
00:29:35,051 --> 00:29:35,292
Yes.

419
00:29:35,452 --> 00:29:35,952
Councilor Falcone?

420
00:29:35,972 --> 00:29:36,072
Yes.

421
00:29:36,953 --> 00:29:37,614
Vice President Knight?

422
00:29:37,674 --> 00:29:37,894
Yes.

423
00:29:38,255 --> 00:29:38,775
Councilor Marks?

424
00:29:38,815 --> 00:29:39,115
Yes.

425
00:29:39,436 --> 00:29:40,036
Councilor Morrell?

426
00:29:40,116 --> 00:29:40,337
Yes.

427
00:29:40,817 --> 00:29:41,538
Councilor Scarpelli?

428
00:29:41,998 --> 00:29:42,279
Yes.

429
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,442
Yes, 7 in favor of the motion passes.

430
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:56,617
2-1-529 offered by Councilor Scott Pelli be it resolved that the city administration organize a professional working group dealing with severe rat concerns in our community.

431
00:29:57,178 --> 00:29:58,220
Councilor Scott Pelli.

432
00:29:59,767 --> 00:30:00,167
Thank you.

433
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:09,310
Mister president again this is something that before weeks ago so I appreciate bringing forward again this evening but I was probably one of them.

434
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:16,652
Most phone calls I've been receiving this from my constituents about the rat problems we're having and

435
00:30:17,912 --> 00:30:36,031
I can understand the plan with the city moving forward with the health department, but I think we really need to move forward more aggressive, more detailed plan, and bringing in some professionals that really see this rodent infestation or rat infestation as being

436
00:30:38,353 --> 00:30:39,473
what they do best.

437
00:30:39,553 --> 00:30:52,235
I think that especially what's going on with the pandemic and what other issues our health department has, I don't think we're really putting enough time to really attack this problem before it even gets worse.

438
00:30:52,295 --> 00:31:05,258
So I know just recently Channel 4 and 5 had Melrose's issues and we had so many different other neighboring communities that are going through the same situation, but I just don't want to

439
00:31:06,618 --> 00:31:13,665
you know, get so far behind with this, this concern that we're going to be, we're going to be really in trouble.

440
00:31:13,725 --> 00:31:25,677
So what I've asked is the city administration, the health department, um, is really work together and try to put together and invite, um, you know, uh, professionals, both the,

441
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:40,343
the academia level and maybe contacting our neighbors and see what we can do as a collaboration, especially when we abut some of these cities that are having such a horrific time with this.

442
00:31:40,383 --> 00:31:42,044
So it is an issue.

443
00:31:42,204 --> 00:31:49,946
I mean, I went to five different homes prior to my little hiatus and

444
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:55,361
The barrels have been eaten through, you see nests.

445
00:31:55,422 --> 00:32:06,770
I know that council's put forth some changes hoping to allow private entities to, public entities to enter private

446
00:32:07,446 --> 00:32:10,647
private homes, so we're hoping we can do more.

447
00:32:10,767 --> 00:32:25,833
So again, really reach out to the city administrator and put together a working group that will attack this and its necessity as it's been called on.

448
00:32:25,873 --> 00:32:26,434
So thank you.

449
00:32:28,494 --> 00:32:29,435
Thank you, Councilor Caput.

450
00:32:31,006 --> 00:32:31,666
Councilor Falco.

451
00:32:31,947 --> 00:32:32,707
Thank you, Mr. President.

452
00:32:32,727 --> 00:32:35,027
I want to thank Councilor Scott Pelley for bringing this forward.

453
00:32:35,648 --> 00:32:43,570
I've received numerous calls from various neighborhoods throughout the city, and it's consistent.

454
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:49,611
I mean, I've received calls from Wellington, North Medford, South Medford.

455
00:32:50,992 --> 00:32:53,333
One person even called me and literally FaceTimed

456
00:32:55,233 --> 00:32:56,795
the rats that were in his backyard.

457
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,959
And it's a real problem.

458
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,260
It needs to be addressed.

459
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:10,348
I know that it's been going on for a while, but I would ask, Mr. President, if you could please schedule a committee to hold a meeting with the health department.

460
00:33:10,368 --> 00:33:15,172
I want to see exactly what they're doing to address this situation.

461
00:33:16,513 --> 00:33:18,275
Are they baiting the sewers?

462
00:33:18,335 --> 00:33:19,557
Are they not baiting the sewers?

463
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:23,481
If they are, what sewers are they baiting?

464
00:33:23,521 --> 00:33:24,742
What neighborhoods are they baiting?

465
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:27,885
This is a concern that is throughout the city.

466
00:33:29,067 --> 00:33:30,008
Like I said, it doesn't matter.

467
00:33:30,929 --> 00:33:33,571
Various neighborhoods and it needs to be addressed.

468
00:33:34,232 --> 00:33:38,597
So I would ask you to, if you would please schedule a committee to the whole meeting with

469
00:33:39,617 --> 00:33:44,521
uh, uh, health department to, um, get some answers with regards to some of those questions.

470
00:33:45,241 --> 00:33:45,682
Yes, please.

471
00:33:45,722 --> 00:33:48,844
If I could amend that councilor Scott Kelly's resolution as amended by council.

472
00:33:48,964 --> 00:33:49,304
Thank you.

473
00:33:51,105 --> 00:33:51,946
Thank you, Mr. President.

474
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:54,087
I think councilor Scott Kelly for bringing this forward.

475
00:33:54,127 --> 00:33:55,929
And I think we saw the same news story.

476
00:33:55,969 --> 00:34:02,033
So I was going to suggest the amendment that the administration either, um, work with,

477
00:34:02,546 --> 00:34:07,829
surrounding cities or encourage representation from surrounding cities because this again, this is a regional problem.

478
00:34:07,849 --> 00:34:09,130
This isn't just a Medford problem.

479
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:14,854
This is every city around us is facing the same issue and the rats don't know where the city border ends.

480
00:34:14,974 --> 00:34:20,857
So I think just working collaboratively with those other cities that are affected, which as far as I can tell is everyone.

481
00:34:21,518 --> 00:34:28,482
So just amending to add that they invite representatives from surrounding communities to this working group if they can attend.

482
00:34:30,215 --> 00:34:32,917
Are you adding it as an amendment also?

483
00:34:34,498 --> 00:34:36,279
Thank you, Councilor.

484
00:34:36,299 --> 00:34:36,759
Councilor Marks.

485
00:34:37,739 --> 00:34:38,540
Thank you, Mr. President.

486
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,781
I want to thank Councilor Scott Pelley for putting this on.

487
00:34:43,283 --> 00:34:49,526
I can date this back to probably at least five or six years ago in the Dexter Street area.

488
00:34:50,367 --> 00:34:53,549
We were getting a number of complaints back then for rats.

489
00:34:54,549 --> 00:34:58,672
The problem has shifted up to the heights around Car Park.

490
00:34:59,572 --> 00:35:01,994
to Wellington and the Haines Square area.

491
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:05,017
I'm getting a ton of complaints, Mr. President.

492
00:35:05,537 --> 00:35:15,125
Just tonight, coming to the meeting, you know how it gets dark early, I put my car lights on in the driveway, and a good-sized rat walked by the garage door.

493
00:35:15,971 --> 00:35:18,014
um, and Wellington that was in my own driveway.

494
00:35:18,714 --> 00:35:21,918
Um, you know, this is becoming a public health crisis.

495
00:35:22,739 --> 00:35:35,092
And in my discussions with the city recently, as of within the last week, because I've been asking about the baiting as councilor Falco mentioned, I was told by a city employee, they no longer bait

496
00:35:35,713 --> 00:35:37,495
the catch basins in the community.

497
00:35:38,315 --> 00:35:44,401
They do not use that as a process for controlling pest control in this community.

498
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:46,303
I'm not sure what the process is.

499
00:35:46,863 --> 00:35:53,610
I can tell you firsthand, when you call and say there's a problem with rats, the city comes out and they give you a leaflet.

500
00:35:55,138 --> 00:35:57,239
And they leaflet all the doors in the neighborhood.

501
00:35:57,739 --> 00:35:59,260
And they'll tell you, don't leave food out.

502
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:00,780
Don't put your barrels out too early.

503
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,381
Don't leave a water source.

504
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:09,144
If you're giving the birds water or squirrels, don't leave that out because rats are going to look for the water source.

505
00:36:10,644 --> 00:36:15,786
You know, if you're growing vegetables outside, make sure you have them contained and not a food source.

506
00:36:16,747 --> 00:36:19,108
There's a lot of, you know,

507
00:36:19,968 --> 00:36:26,931
things residents can do, Mr. President, but I don't believe the city has acted enough on behalf of its residents.

508
00:36:27,331 --> 00:36:32,633
And I've stated this in the past, and I need to be critical, Mr. President, because yes, this is a problem.

509
00:36:32,933 --> 00:36:38,855
I read an article recently in the Town Online that said how it's a not sure problem.

510
00:36:39,355 --> 00:36:43,457
But yes, it's a problem in other communities, but we're not doing enough.

511
00:36:43,897 --> 00:36:45,477
And I brought this up during budget.

512
00:36:45,958 --> 00:36:55,081
I believe, and I don't have the number in front of me, it was in between $10,000 to $15,000 that we spend citywide for pest control.

513
00:36:56,302 --> 00:37:03,826
Anyone that's called someone to do pest control, they'll come out your house, it's $300, $400 a whack to do an extermination around one home.

514
00:37:04,566 --> 00:37:14,672
Here we have seven square miles with 15,000 homes, and we're spending $10,000 to $15,000 on pest control, and we have a rat problem.

515
00:37:15,952 --> 00:37:18,293
It just doesn't make sense, Mr. President.

516
00:37:18,913 --> 00:37:20,994
And I don't believe the city's taking it seriously.

517
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:24,615
And I agree with Councilor Falco and Councilor Scott Pelley.

518
00:37:25,195 --> 00:37:31,998
We need to call for a meeting, Mr. President, pretty quickly to find out what the Board of Health's doing regarding this.

519
00:37:32,318 --> 00:37:38,520
We're bringing in as contractors, because clearly we don't have the bandwidth or the capacity

520
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,041
to handle it internally.

521
00:37:40,481 --> 00:37:59,435
And secondly, Mr. President, as I stated before, and I'm not sure if the city's working on it or not, this council voted unanimously, uh, as part of, uh, the, uh, ordinance that we put together was to, uh, allow for a document that residents can sign that would release the city of Method from any liability.

522
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:05,300
If the city of Method saw that they had, uh, you know, rat colonies on their property,

523
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:21,376
and the resident was unable to afford it, or it was a non-owner occupied residency, that they could sign a form and have the city come in, because this is a public health crisis, no different than COVID.

524
00:38:22,096 --> 00:38:26,060
If there's a large nest of one property, that affects everyone on the street.

525
00:38:26,941 --> 00:38:34,263
And I believe it's the responsibility of the community as well as the city to step in, Mr. President, where need be.

526
00:38:34,843 --> 00:38:36,524
And we're at that point right now.

527
00:38:36,624 --> 00:38:46,707
So I would ask if the as an amendment to if the city administration has created that waiver form, I believe last I heard from the Board of Health, they were working on it.

528
00:38:48,007 --> 00:39:03,315
But if they create a waiver form that would allow residents to free the city from liability and assist residents in the containment and the control of pests in this community, i.e.

529
00:39:03,395 --> 00:39:04,356
rats, Mr. President.

530
00:39:04,376 --> 00:39:04,736
Thank you.

531
00:39:05,637 --> 00:39:05,957
Thank you.

532
00:39:07,398 --> 00:39:16,782
Uh, and like I said, I, I've been getting calls from people at the hillside, uh, up there and, uh, and you know, within a lot, a lot of it's coming from, uh, as Councilor Marks mentioned, people feeding the birds.

533
00:39:17,923 --> 00:39:21,504
Uh, the bird feeders are, uh, seem to be a big, a big problem, big part of it also.

534
00:39:22,345 --> 00:39:34,070
Uh, so, uh, the motion by Councilor Scott Pelli is amended by Councilor Falcone, is amended by Councilor Morrell and Councilor Marks has also amended it.

535
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:39,756
seconded by second, seconded by vice president.

536
00:39:40,136 --> 00:39:41,437
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

537
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:46,480
Yes.

538
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:46,760
Yes.

539
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:47,320
Yes.

540
00:39:47,861 --> 00:39:48,161
Yes.

541
00:39:48,201 --> 00:39:48,461
Yes.

542
00:39:49,442 --> 00:39:49,842
Yes.

543
00:39:50,202 --> 00:39:50,402
Yes.

544
00:39:58,177 --> 00:39:58,918
Motion passes.

545
00:39:58,978 --> 00:40:01,820
Mr. President, motion to suspend the rules to take paper 21-5-5-1.

546
00:40:02,841 --> 00:40:07,866
On the motion by Councilor Baird, suspend the rules to take paper, which one?

547
00:40:08,627 --> 00:40:12,691
It's the communications from city officers.

548
00:40:12,971 --> 00:40:15,473
Okay, 2-1-5-5-1, seconded by Vice President Knife.

549
00:40:15,774 --> 00:40:16,875
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

550
00:40:27,232 --> 00:40:27,332
Yes.

551
00:40:27,352 --> 00:40:27,633
Yes.

552
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:28,074
Yes.

553
00:40:28,675 --> 00:40:28,936
Yes.

554
00:40:29,016 --> 00:40:29,216
Yes.

555
00:40:29,397 --> 00:40:29,597
Yes.

556
00:40:39,715 --> 00:40:46,496
Communications with city offices employees 21551 to President Caravaglia and members of the Memphis City Council.

557
00:40:46,976 --> 00:41:06,580
We respectfully request that you're all on board to approve one of the three re-presenting maps presented during the last two Committee of the Whole meetings of September 28th, 2021 and October 5th, 2021 after you consider the October 5th Committee of the Whole report.

558
00:41:07,696 --> 00:41:21,880
full plans for redistricting are available for view in the city clerk's office and online at drivegoogle.com, backslash file D20.

559
00:41:25,482 --> 00:41:28,983
I think if you call the clerk, it'd be a lot easier than we're trying to read these off.

560
00:41:30,143 --> 00:41:33,244
So, um, um,

561
00:41:34,365 --> 00:41:37,067
I think we have to do the committee report first, correct?

562
00:41:37,167 --> 00:41:37,868
That's fine with me.

563
00:41:38,808 --> 00:41:39,469
While we're under suspension.

564
00:41:39,489 --> 00:41:41,430
Before we do that, we have to re-report this out to the committee.

565
00:41:42,151 --> 00:41:49,816
So, we can have a motion to take the reports of committees first.

566
00:41:50,116 --> 00:41:50,557
So moved.

567
00:41:51,297 --> 00:41:59,183
On the motion by Councilor Baez, seconded by Councilor Falco to accept the report of the committee meeting 21551 on October 5th, 2021.

568
00:42:04,591 --> 00:42:06,232
seconded by Councilor Knight.

569
00:42:08,453 --> 00:42:09,534
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

570
00:42:10,555 --> 00:42:10,795
Yes.

571
00:42:10,855 --> 00:42:11,115
Yes.

572
00:42:13,277 --> 00:42:14,197
Yes.

573
00:42:14,437 --> 00:42:18,460
Yes.

574
00:42:21,482 --> 00:42:21,782
Yes.

575
00:42:23,683 --> 00:42:23,883
Yes.

576
00:42:23,923 --> 00:42:25,204
Six in the affirmative, one absent.

577
00:42:25,644 --> 00:42:29,407
Motion passes to report the paper favorably.

578
00:42:29,427 --> 00:42:30,788
Okay.

579
00:42:30,808 --> 00:42:30,928
So

580
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,121
Good evening, guys.

581
00:42:34,161 --> 00:42:35,162
Name and address of the record, please.

582
00:42:35,442 --> 00:42:35,962
Good evening.

583
00:42:36,083 --> 00:42:40,206
Sandra Gale, Acting Election Coordinator, 85 George P. Houset Drive.

584
00:42:44,470 --> 00:42:48,373
Give a brief presentation on what you'd like to do today.

585
00:42:49,819 --> 00:43:00,968
Sure, so as all the councilors know, over the last two weeks, we've presented initially two maps, and then we added an additional one last week.

586
00:43:01,028 --> 00:43:13,718
So we have plan A, plan B, and plan C. I think we covered all of the sort of glitches that we may find with any of the three maps.

587
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:18,082
However, the one thing that was left out, and it was brought to my attention by

588
00:43:18,686 --> 00:43:29,790
the clerk last week was that there is going to be an impact based on whatever map you choose to the voter.

589
00:43:31,111 --> 00:43:40,334
So if you choose plan A, the voter impact of moving to a different precinct is low.

590
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,495
Plan B is a little higher.

591
00:43:44,556 --> 00:43:47,597
Plan C is gonna cover probably at least

592
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,551
50% of the city, I believe, Mr. Clark, is what we said.

593
00:43:51,571 --> 00:43:54,555
It's going to be, it would be at least a third of the city.

594
00:43:54,675 --> 00:43:55,376
At least a third.

595
00:43:55,436 --> 00:43:58,260
We would be taking 16 precincts and going to 24 precincts.

596
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,664
So it would be at least a third, it could be higher than that.

597
00:44:03,077 --> 00:44:15,259
So, as you mentioned, that is what information vice president night, I do believe that would give us the capacity, though, to see growth of city population upwards of 38,000 people over the next 10 years without having to worry about having to do this again.

598
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:17,160
So it seems like an option.

599
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,821
See, you know, in fact, the voter had to be moved this time.

600
00:44:23,381 --> 00:44:31,423
Once it's done, it's done because we've been able to address the future population growth to such an extent capacity.

601
00:44:31,463 --> 00:44:32,683
I don't see it having to change again.

602
00:44:33,964 --> 00:44:37,766
Vice President, that is indeed one of the benefits of Plan C, but I believe Ms.

603
00:44:37,786 --> 00:44:41,088
Gale was talking about one of the potential adverse impacts.

604
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:43,730
But you are correct, that is one of the benefits.

605
00:44:48,053 --> 00:44:55,057
Plan B is also probably the most immediate solution.

606
00:44:56,138 --> 00:44:58,760
I know that there would be impact in the Wellington area.

607
00:44:59,531 --> 00:45:10,523
But when you look at where the exponential growth for the city of Medford has come from, in the last seven to nine years, it has been the Wellington area.

608
00:45:11,544 --> 00:45:19,693
And the Wellington area is one of the areas where we were very top heavy in regards to not meeting that 4,000

609
00:45:21,548 --> 00:45:25,491
residents, and that's what we have to remember.

610
00:45:25,571 --> 00:45:33,156
There are different terms and things that we use, but it's 4,000 residents per precinct, plus or minus 5%.

611
00:45:34,837 --> 00:45:45,044
So in order to eliminate that and allow us for the growth for the pending 40Bs, as I stated early on in the packet,

612
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:51,283
Plan B would be the way that would address that.

613
00:45:51,863 --> 00:46:16,549
I also understand the council's position where you want to have the least amount of change, and that could leave you back at Plan A. Plan A still would impact the city with some change as far as boundaries are concerned, but not as much change if you went with Plan A. So if anyone has any questions,

614
00:46:17,842 --> 00:46:18,382
Questions from Ms.

615
00:46:18,422 --> 00:46:18,683
Gale?

616
00:46:19,523 --> 00:46:20,104
Mr. President?

617
00:46:20,584 --> 00:46:21,105
Council Box?

618
00:46:22,225 --> 00:46:23,727
Thanks again, Senator.

619
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:25,368
I appreciate all your time and effort on this.

620
00:46:26,929 --> 00:46:42,361
So, with Plan A, will we be able to address some of the concerns that were raised by this council regarding someone that may live up the heights and have to go down to the Roberts School to vote and not the Firefighters Club?

621
00:46:42,801 --> 00:46:45,263
Will we be able to address some of those issues within Plan A?

622
00:46:45,563 --> 00:46:45,724
No.

623
00:46:46,184 --> 00:46:46,524
We won't?

624
00:46:46,905 --> 00:46:46,985
No.

625
00:46:47,895 --> 00:46:56,141
So the only thing that plan A does for you is it shifts the boundary lines, a couple of streets, or maybe a block.

626
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:56,462
Ms.

627
00:46:56,482 --> 00:46:56,762
Gale?

628
00:46:57,042 --> 00:46:57,262
Yes.

629
00:46:57,582 --> 00:47:00,765
I think actually plan A is nine words and plan B is eight words.

630
00:47:00,825 --> 00:47:04,067
So I think we've just been, we've been referring to them.

631
00:47:04,968 --> 00:47:05,629
Incorrectly?

632
00:47:05,909 --> 00:47:06,149
Yes.

633
00:47:09,271 --> 00:47:11,793
Well, I have plan A. Am I wrong?

634
00:47:13,695 --> 00:47:13,975
Okay.

635
00:47:13,995 --> 00:47:14,275
Sorry.

636
00:47:14,335 --> 00:47:14,996
My apologies.

637
00:47:21,912 --> 00:47:27,453
So plan A, the one, is that the one, Councilor Martins, are you asking?

638
00:47:27,493 --> 00:47:29,913
Plan A is really no change at all, right?

639
00:47:29,993 --> 00:47:35,814
No, it changes a couple of streets, plus or minus, but it's not a huge change.

640
00:47:37,255 --> 00:47:38,335
Right, right, correct.

641
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:40,715
I just want to make sure we're all on the same page, that's the way I understand it.

642
00:47:40,735 --> 00:47:42,776
Sorry about that, my apologies.

643
00:47:42,936 --> 00:47:46,756
So plan A wouldn't address some of the concerns that this council has had.

644
00:47:46,776 --> 00:47:50,777
I know Councilor Falco mentioned it and I mentioned it at the last meeting,

645
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:58,411
with addressing some of the concerns of residents saying, why can't I vote at this precinct across the street from my house and I have to drive three miles?

646
00:48:00,392 --> 00:48:02,333
So, we can't address it with that.

647
00:48:02,614 --> 00:48:12,218
Potentially, we could address that with a plan B that creates the additional ward in the Wellington area and shift areas based on that?

648
00:48:12,518 --> 00:48:12,738
Yes.

649
00:48:14,299 --> 00:48:17,621
It addresses some, but it doesn't address all.

650
00:48:17,881 --> 00:48:18,101
Okay.

651
00:48:21,179 --> 00:48:43,257
And it also addresses the abutment of numbers so that we get correct with, if 11 starts here at say three o'clock, we're gonna move the hands of the clock and go this way and say one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, so that we are counterclockwise correct with what our ward numbers are.

652
00:48:44,739 --> 00:48:46,560
So that addresses that as well.

653
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,361
Okay, thank you.

654
00:48:48,662 --> 00:48:49,142
You're welcome.

655
00:48:49,202 --> 00:48:50,123
Mr. Clerk, I'd like to speak.

656
00:48:51,805 --> 00:48:55,255
Just to follow up on your point, Council Marks, the council can move a polling place.

657
00:48:59,857 --> 00:49:03,098
outside the census process and has done that.

658
00:49:03,418 --> 00:49:11,801
The council moved the poll in place for 3-1 out of Lawrence Memorial, the former Lawrence Memorial Hospital into the American Legion.

659
00:49:13,161 --> 00:49:18,023
Moved 8-2 out of the VFW and into the South Medford Fire Station.

660
00:49:18,863 --> 00:49:20,464
Moved 2-1 out of St.

661
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,624
Francis and into the Roberts School.

662
00:49:23,005 --> 00:49:24,045
So the council, I mean,

663
00:49:24,967 --> 00:49:31,213
Sandy and I would have to look at the realignment of polling places, but we could move some polling places.

664
00:49:32,395 --> 00:49:33,596
I wouldn't want to do it wholesale.

665
00:49:33,616 --> 00:49:42,165
I would want to look at them case by case, but that's one of the things we can look at regardless of the outcome of your votes over the next couple of meetings.

666
00:49:42,205 --> 00:49:45,508
We can still look at realigning polling places.

667
00:49:46,409 --> 00:49:48,111
That can be done outside the census process.

668
00:49:48,511 --> 00:49:59,016
But for the documents Sandy's talking about, if there's a new ward created, for instance, or if there are eight new precincts created, for instance, we would have to get the polling places approved as part of this, as part of this census process.

669
00:50:00,037 --> 00:50:04,459
Existing polling places can be moved around and you have, and the council has done so before.

670
00:50:04,479 --> 00:50:07,801
Thank you.

671
00:50:08,681 --> 00:50:09,862
The clerk just addressed my question.

672
00:50:09,982 --> 00:50:10,242
Thank you.

673
00:50:16,281 --> 00:50:17,601
Any further questions for Ms.

674
00:50:17,621 --> 00:50:17,981
Gale?

675
00:50:18,782 --> 00:50:28,564
Motion to adopt option C. On the motion to by Vice President Knight adopt sections map C, seconded by?

676
00:50:28,584 --> 00:50:28,764
Seconded.

677
00:50:29,784 --> 00:50:31,085
Seconded by Councilor Morrell.

678
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,145

681

Ready for the roll call.

Councillor Bears?

683
00:50:56,059 --> 00:50:56,339
Yes.

684
00:50:57,159 --> 00:50:57,800
Councillor Falcone?

685
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:58,060
No.

686
00:50:59,661 --> 00:51:00,361
Vice President Knight?

687
00:51:00,581 --> 00:51:00,801
Yes.

688
00:51:01,722 --> 00:51:02,262
Councillor Marks?

689
00:51:02,522 --> 00:51:02,783

690

692
00:51:05,964 --> 00:51:06,705
Councillor Scarpelli?

693
00:51:08,246 --> 00:51:08,506
Yes.

694

Councillor Karygiannis?

695
00:51:11,147 --> 00:51:11,327
No.

696
00:51:15,310 --> 00:51:16,871
Four in the affirmative, three in the negative.

697
00:51:16,891 --> 00:51:17,731
Motion passes.

698
00:51:19,752 --> 00:51:20,212
Thank you, Sandy.

699
00:51:22,003 --> 00:51:26,625
Motion to revert back to regular business by Councilor Behrs, seconded by Vice President Knight.

700
00:51:26,665 --> 00:51:28,005

Who moved to revert?

702
00:51:33,527 --> 00:51:34,047

And who seconded?

704
00:51:35,508 --> 00:51:36,128

A and C really, but yes.

707
00:51:51,818 --> 00:51:52,538
Councilor Falco.

708
00:51:53,979 --> 00:51:54,759
This is to revert.

709
00:51:56,779 --> 00:51:57,539
Vice President Knight.

710
00:51:58,660 --> 00:51:59,140
Yes, sir.

711
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:01,860
Councilor Marks.

712
00:52:02,521 --> 00:52:02,721
Yes.

713
00:52:03,061 --> 00:52:03,741
Councilor Morrell.

714
00:52:03,881 --> 00:52:04,141
Yes.

715
00:52:04,401 --> 00:52:05,181
Councilor Scarpelli.

716
00:52:06,422 --> 00:52:06,682
Yes.

717
00:52:07,722 --> 00:52:08,542
President Caravaglia.

718
00:52:08,742 --> 00:52:09,422
Yes.

719
00:52:09,442 --> 00:52:10,302
Assembly affirmative.

720
00:52:11,083 --> 00:52:11,943
Motion passes.

721
00:52:13,128 --> 00:52:25,076
2-1-576 offered by Vice President Knight, being so resolved that the Memphis City Council recognized the following 41 Memphis athletes who participated in the 2021 Boston Marathon.

722
00:52:26,617 --> 00:52:40,446
Ibrahim Abdullah, Amanda Bucla, Thomas Bollens, Carmen Bolas-Debron, Deidre Calvert, Brandon Campbell, Kelly Catalo, Gabriel Clemente, Steven Calella,

723
00:52:42,925 --> 00:53:11,653
Michelle Corrado, Kate Daniel, Michelle Danaher, Jessica Gatton, David Grotz, Kelsey Heavy, Michael Jefferson, David King, John Klein, Kylie Klinger, Clyde Maloney, Brendan McCabe, Matthew Morabito, Roy Monier, John Needham, James Nye, Andrew Novis, Caitlin O'Brien, Michelle O'Connell, Wendy Pilato,

724
00:53:13,186 --> 00:53:33,539
Bowen Beard, Margaret Pitt, Michael Pooley, Blake Raymond, Bess Ritter, Leo Sacco, Dina Scarpelli, Michael Sullivan, William Tucker, Michael Tuttle, Gregory Wilson, Gregory 29, Jose Yaska, Jose 34.

725
00:53:37,957 --> 00:53:38,637
Vice President Knight.

726
00:53:39,038 --> 00:53:40,279
Mr. President, thank you very much.

727
00:53:40,339 --> 00:53:48,667
As you read off those names, I'm sure many of us see many familiar faces, hear many familiar faces that had the opportunity to run in the Boston Marathon just the other day.

728
00:53:49,287 --> 00:54:00,238
You know, when you think about all the counsel Scott Pelley's going through over the recent months to understand that his wife ran the Boston Marathon on Tuesday and then was there to support her family through this time of need.

729
00:54:00,738 --> 00:54:02,560
Tuesday evenings is something that's amazing.

730
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,903
It's just such a sign of what a strong woman she is.

731
00:54:05,303 --> 00:54:14,772
And that goes for all of these athletes that participated in the Boston Marathon, Mr. President, because it takes a certain type of person to be able to run 26.1 miles consecutively with nobody chasing you.

732
00:54:14,833 --> 00:54:20,158
So with that being said, Mr. President, I think it's beautiful that these individuals were able to get out there and get back on the track.

733
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:27,540
and follow the lead of Medford's own David McGilvery, race director, and enjoying yet another successful Boston Marathon.

734
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:40,744
So with that being said, Mr. President, it's quite a celebration, a full year's worth of training goes into this, and for these individuals to have the opportunity to participate in the fashion and way that they did, something that's truly beautiful, and it's certainly what athletics is all about.

735
00:54:41,124 --> 00:54:45,345
So with that being said, Mr. President, I want to extend my condolences, my sincere

736
00:54:45,965 --> 00:54:49,027
Congratulations to these individuals for participating in the Boston Marathon.

737
00:54:49,368 --> 00:54:57,054
I'm sure it would feel like a condolence the day after the marathon, but the accomplishment of completing it, Mr. President, is something nonetheless.

738
00:54:58,775 --> 00:54:59,676
Thank you, Mr. Vice President.

739
00:54:59,716 --> 00:55:00,456
Any further discussion?

740
00:55:01,377 --> 00:55:03,819
Oh, on the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by?

741
00:55:04,119 --> 00:55:04,439
Second.

742
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:06,181
Seconded by Councilor Baez.

743
00:55:06,801 --> 00:55:07,842
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

744
00:55:11,078 --> 00:55:11,279
Yes.

745
00:55:11,299 --> 00:55:11,599
Yes.

746
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,040
Yes.

747
00:55:12,221 --> 00:55:12,421
Yes.

748
00:55:12,441 --> 00:55:12,501
Yes.

749
00:55:19,833 --> 00:55:20,633
President Caravaglia.

750
00:55:20,913 --> 00:55:40,262
Yes, I mean affirmative motion passes to one five seven seven offered by Council Morrell whereas the same effort currently exercises the local option for a tax deferments in accordance with mass general law chapter 59 section 5 paragraph 41 in whereas the upper income limit for eligible residents 65 and over is 50,000 per year.

751
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:52,001
be it so resolved that a new tax limit for the program be set by tying it to the state senior circuit breaker tax credit yearly maximum cap.

752
00:55:52,121 --> 00:55:52,702
Councilor Morrell.

753
00:55:53,353 --> 00:55:54,113
Thank you, Mr. President.

754
00:55:54,253 --> 00:55:56,614
Yeah, this is something we discussed in April of 2020.

755
00:55:56,674 --> 00:56:01,176
The council voted to raise this to $50,000 per year.

756
00:56:01,216 --> 00:56:10,558
So this is a state program that the city engages in, and the city council has the ability to set the maximum income cap for people who can participate.

757
00:56:10,579 --> 00:56:17,421
And it can be raised up to the senior circuit breaker number, which is adjusted every year.

758
00:56:17,561 --> 00:56:19,581
When we discussed this back in April of 2020,

759
00:56:21,682 --> 00:56:27,344
We're you know the council is rightfully concerned to see what we're going to get as far as real estate receipts and didn't want to raise this too high.

760
00:56:27,824 --> 00:56:40,067
I believe Councilor Vice President Knight brought up the idea of just automatically tying it to the senior circuit breaker so we don't have to revisit this every so often as the state already adjusts that number reflective of cost of living.

761
00:56:40,467 --> 00:56:47,213
This is a program that not a lot of people participate in, but for some people it is, you know, a lifesaver, a game changer program.

762
00:56:47,253 --> 00:56:51,677
So I would just want to see that it be opened up to as many residents as possible.

763
00:56:51,717 --> 00:56:56,522
But I mean, we're still talking single digits, I believe, as far as people who participate in the program.

764
00:56:57,402 --> 00:57:01,145
I did ask Ellen for an updated number on number of participants.

765
00:57:01,225 --> 00:57:02,666
I don't have that number just yet.

766
00:57:03,666 --> 00:57:04,467
We do have time.

767
00:57:04,547 --> 00:57:08,890
I believe this has to be set by April for the fiscal year 2023.

768
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:14,514
So if my fellow counselors would like to see this as a committee of the whole, I'm more than happy to move it there.

769
00:57:15,194 --> 00:57:22,339
But I think this is just a smart way to approach this program and then have it match that level set by the state.

770
00:57:27,528 --> 00:57:33,375
I would just move approval.

771
00:57:33,995 --> 00:57:35,717
I think this is a smart program.

772
00:57:35,817 --> 00:57:41,404
I know that the number of people who use it is pretty low and I have run into several residents in 50,000 in Medford.

773
00:57:43,212 --> 00:57:45,614
is not, not a big income anymore these days.

774
00:57:45,955 --> 00:57:54,183
Um, and I know I've talked to several people who, um, want to take advantage of this program and, and, you know, maybe their pension or their social security is a little bit more than $50,000.

775
00:57:54,603 --> 00:58:02,151
Um, so I think it makes sense to, uh, to tie it to the, to the maximum allowed by the state circuit breaker tax credit.

776
00:58:02,371 --> 00:58:03,532
So that's why I would move approval.

777
00:58:05,014 --> 00:58:06,175
Uh, uh, council box.

778
00:58:07,346 --> 00:58:12,810
Thank you, Mr. President, and I want to thank my colleague for offering this tonight, Mr. President.

779
00:58:13,611 --> 00:58:21,478
I see this a little differently, Mr. President, and I'm not opposed to tax deferments in our community.

780
00:58:22,238 --> 00:58:27,123
I think they could help some, but as what you heard tonight, Mr. President,

781
00:58:27,603 --> 00:58:34,729
There's less than a handful of people that actually choose to defer their taxes that are eligible.

782
00:58:36,471 --> 00:58:43,657
My issue, Mr. President, is not deferring taxes, but keeping taxes affordable in the community.

783
00:58:44,822 --> 00:58:47,723
And I think that's been a long, ongoing issue.

784
00:58:48,483 --> 00:59:03,929
And the more residents I bump into, in particular, seniors on fixed incomes, Mr. President, they're concerned about the raising of taxes and the talk that's been out there in the community about potential Proposition 2.5 overrides.

785
00:59:05,490 --> 00:59:12,096
And that scares a lot of seniors on fixed incomes, a lot of families that are struggling right now, Mr. President.

786
00:59:12,957 --> 00:59:23,267
And I think those are the conversations we should be having to assist the masses regarding taxes and allowing people to stay in the community.

787
00:59:23,287 --> 00:59:26,110
You know, we hear all the buzzwords about affordable housing.

788
00:59:27,237 --> 00:59:33,684
But when you keep on raising taxes and people can no longer live in the community, how affordable is that?

789
00:59:34,545 --> 00:59:43,675
And we can have all the discussions we want around deferments, but a deferment is a 5% tax on the tax that you're not paying.

790
00:59:44,596 --> 00:59:46,618
So, and that adds up, Mr. President.

791
00:59:46,978 --> 00:59:58,566
And as we raise taxes every year, and God forbid there's a two and a half override, that 5% grows because of the additional tax burden that we're placing every year on residents.

792
00:59:59,106 --> 01:00:14,017
So I think if we're going to get serious about looking at this, the issue is not to look at deferments, even if we raise the limits, you know, and another half a dozen people took advantage, you know, that doesn't reach the masses in the community.

793
01:00:14,337 --> 01:00:29,043
It doesn't reach the seniors that are struggling, Mr. President, not just with their tax bill, with their cable bill, Mr. President, with the cost of gas, with the cost of electricity, with the cost of oil, with everything going up simultaneously.

794
01:00:29,663 --> 01:00:31,284
That's what's hurting people right now.

795
01:00:31,964 --> 01:00:37,447
So I'd rather have the discussions on how are we going to keep our tax rate low?

796
01:00:37,947 --> 01:00:40,208
How are we going to look at other revenue sources?

797
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:44,582
Are we talking about looking at generating other revenue?

798
01:00:45,342 --> 01:01:04,112
As our commercial property base shrinks, and it is, Mr. President, it's no secret, as it shrinks and they double the tax rate of residential, we are going to be shifting the burden, maybe not now, maybe not next year, but eventually to the residential taxpayer.

799
01:01:04,592 --> 01:01:10,253
So they're going to pay a higher tax rate because of the shrinking commercial base in this community.

800
01:01:10,733 --> 01:01:24,576
These are the discussions that the office of community development had, Mr. President.

801
01:01:25,136 --> 01:01:29,897
So, you know, I want to just make sure that we're sending the right message.

802
01:01:31,050 --> 01:01:37,173
And maybe this council should be sending a message that we want to entertain a proposition two and a half override.

803
01:01:37,673 --> 01:01:54,921
And that would allow a lot of people in this community to rest assure that whatever is done is according to the state statute, which is below two and a half, Mr. President, even that to many seniors is a tough pill to swallow.

804
01:01:55,895 --> 01:01:58,678
It's between getting your medicine or paying your taxes.

805
01:01:59,378 --> 01:01:59,759
Or eating.

806
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:00,660
Or eating.

807
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:04,143
And that's a bitter pill to swallow, Mr. President.

808
01:02:04,504 --> 01:02:05,625
And we have a lot of seniors.

809
01:02:05,685 --> 01:02:09,989
I've stated over and over again, we, Benford has a large percentage of seniors.

810
01:02:11,350 --> 01:02:14,173
So you may have bought your house 40 years ago for $130,000.

811
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:15,194
Now it's worth $850,000.

812
01:02:19,717 --> 01:02:26,063
But you're property rich and money poor, Mr. President, because you're living on a pension from 1970 or 1960.

813
01:02:26,364 --> 01:02:31,769
And it's not keeping up with the rate of inflation.

814
01:02:32,790 --> 01:02:33,731
And this is what's happening.

815
01:02:33,931 --> 01:02:35,273
I hear it over and over again.

816
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:37,404
How can we assist?

817
01:02:37,765 --> 01:02:45,288
And I tell people, in city government, it's inherent that, you know, that we have cost of living raises, we have contractual obligations.

818
01:02:45,629 --> 01:02:48,490
There's a lot going on, a lot of moving parts in the city.

819
01:02:49,531 --> 01:02:52,932
And I try to explain some of the modest increases that have happened.

820
01:02:53,252 --> 01:02:57,935
And this council, year after year, votes, Mr. President, to shift the burden to commercial.

821
01:02:59,356 --> 01:03:02,300
But eventually, the commercial businesses are saying, you know what?

822
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,082
I'm not going to do business in Memphis.

823
01:03:04,102 --> 01:03:04,943
They're crazy now.

824
01:03:05,223 --> 01:03:06,625
Their tax rate's ridiculous.

825
01:03:06,865 --> 01:03:10,770
I'll just go the next town over, and we'll set up shop there.

826
01:03:11,211 --> 01:03:12,793
And that's what we're seeing, Mr. President.

827
01:03:13,485 --> 01:03:18,249
And it's unfortunate, and the burden is going to be flipped to the residential taxpayer.

828
01:03:18,609 --> 01:03:20,911
Do we need to do things in the community?

829
01:03:21,571 --> 01:03:22,132
Absolutely.

830
01:03:22,172 --> 01:03:27,155
The projects that we need to work on that are outside the scope of a budget, absolutely.

831
01:03:27,656 --> 01:03:29,817
And those are the things we have to look at, Mr. President.

832
01:03:30,117 --> 01:03:32,399
And there are other avenues to address those issues.

833
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:36,222
It's not just looking at a Prop 2.5 override.

834
01:03:37,023 --> 01:03:40,085
You can look at debt exclusion, which is a one-time fixed cost.

835
01:03:41,786 --> 01:03:44,007
for a particular project that needs to be done.

836
01:03:44,027 --> 01:03:48,150
So I'm not saying we should never move ahead on projects that we need to do in the community.

837
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:50,552
What I'm saying is we have to be mindful.

838
01:03:50,592 --> 01:03:56,896
If we're going to talk about keeping people in their homes and making method affordable, you can't do both.

839
01:03:56,936 --> 01:04:03,500
You can't raise taxes to the limit and then look at two and a half overrides and say, I'm for affordability.

840
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:05,101
You're talking out of both sides of your mouth.

841
01:04:06,542 --> 01:04:08,463
And those are the discussions, Mr. President.

842
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:11,921
Not an attempt, which I support.

843
01:04:12,181 --> 01:04:16,484
I was the one that lowered the age for senior property tax exemption from 70 to 65.

844
01:04:16,764 --> 01:04:20,346
That was my resolution back many years ago, Mr. President.

845
01:04:21,447 --> 01:04:26,510
Because the need was out there in the community, and it still exists out there in the community.

846
01:04:26,771 --> 01:04:32,915
And I hate to see people displaced because they can't afford to pay a property tax, Mr. President.

847
01:04:33,355 --> 01:04:37,878
And to me, a deferral is not the answer, especially when you keep raising taxes.

848
01:04:38,138 --> 01:04:39,219
That is not the answer.

849
01:04:39,813 --> 01:04:40,534
Does it help some?

850
01:04:40,914 --> 01:04:41,655
It may help some.

851
01:04:42,396 --> 01:04:45,740
According to the numbers, it doesn't look like it helps many in our community.

852
01:04:46,361 --> 01:04:50,326
I also want people to be aware, Mr. President, the Community Preservation Act.

853
01:04:51,447 --> 01:04:57,835
There is an exemption for persons with low or moderate income, and they should contact the assessor's office.

854
01:04:59,296 --> 01:05:04,840
If that's a burden to you, there's an exemption by state statute that allows you to be exempt from that.

855
01:05:05,581 --> 01:05:06,701
And people should be aware of that.

856
01:05:06,722 --> 01:05:09,484
You'd be surprised how many people are not aware of that.

857
01:05:09,524 --> 01:05:12,085
They don't know what the exemptions are.

858
01:05:13,166 --> 01:05:14,727
So that's another thing, Mr. President.

859
01:05:15,008 --> 01:05:24,495
There's the seniors over 70, disabled veterans in our community, which is a tax exemption, persons that are blind, Mr. President, and over 65 with low income.

860
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:31,432
There's all sorts of criteria with those, but you can contact the assessor's office and they can walk you through the process.

861
01:05:33,273 --> 01:05:34,753
So I think we have to have that.

862
01:05:34,773 --> 01:05:50,136
I'm not going to be on the council come January, but these are the discussions that I hope to leave with my colleagues to be mindful that there is other people out in the community that aren't as, uh, uh, you know, um,

863
01:05:51,810 --> 01:05:55,751
in a better predicament, Mr. President, that are living day to day.

864
01:05:56,511 --> 01:06:01,732
You may not see them, you may not hear from them, but they're out there and they're struggling.

865
01:06:02,392 --> 01:06:03,292
Thank you, Mr. President.

866
01:06:04,233 --> 01:06:06,253
Thank you.

867
01:06:06,673 --> 01:06:07,813
Mr. President, thank you very much.

868
01:06:08,793 --> 01:06:16,215
I certainly agree with Councilor Max in some aspects of this discussion that it does warrant further discussion, but

869
01:06:16,935 --> 01:06:24,396
In terms of the matter that's before us this evening, I think it's something that we should sit down with the city solicitor and the city assessor.

870
01:06:25,612 --> 01:06:33,078
talk about what it is we need to do to use the appropriate language to further enhance this local option.

871
01:06:34,639 --> 01:06:47,510
It does warrant a bit of further discussion, and the reason I think it warrants a bit of further discussion is because I want to make sure that we do it right, so that these individuals that do become eligible for this deferment can apply for it and the council can do it procedurally properly.

872
01:06:48,692 --> 01:06:50,233
When you look at the deferment, it's a deferment.

873
01:06:50,293 --> 01:06:51,294
It's not an exemption.

874
01:06:52,015 --> 01:06:53,436
The individual is going to have to pay it back.

875
01:06:54,316 --> 01:06:57,859
So really what this does is it provides somebody with a housing stability option.

876
01:06:59,159 --> 01:07:05,444
It expands access to a safety net program, Mr. President, and it gives us another tool, the toolbox that we can use to help people here in this community.

877
01:07:07,385 --> 01:07:09,967
Councilmax makes very valid points.

878
01:07:11,108 --> 01:07:12,069
Very, very valid points.

879
01:07:12,249 --> 01:07:23,678
But ultimately, right now, with this matter before us, we have a piece of paper that allows us to exercise a local option that's within our scope, purview, and discretion of this council to act.

880
01:07:24,458 --> 01:07:25,739
And I think it

881
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:35,223
you know, highlights the value of deferment when we talk about all these issues that are going on in this community and the push and pull of people, a feeling when it comes to the pocketbook.

882
01:07:36,584 --> 01:07:39,425
So for those reasons, Mr. President, I certainly support the measure.

883
01:07:39,445 --> 01:07:41,086
I think it's a great idea, Councilor Morrell.

884
01:07:41,386 --> 01:07:42,206
I wonder where you got it.

885
01:07:43,026 --> 01:07:43,227
And

886
01:07:45,948 --> 01:07:53,954
And I'm hoping that we can meet on it in a committee of the whole with the assessor and the city solicitor to further discuss it because I do think it provides value to the community, Mr. President.

887
01:07:54,635 --> 01:08:03,281
What it does is it says if somebody has a difficult time paying, they can come to the city and if they meet the income guidelines and the qualifications, they can defer those payments.

888
01:08:03,321 --> 01:08:06,143
I don't think that there's anything scary or wrong with that.

889
01:08:06,543 --> 01:08:08,745
I think that's a service that we could provide here.

890
01:08:09,325 --> 01:08:12,828
And I think that it's something that would be beneficial to not many, but some.

891
01:08:13,348 --> 01:08:15,129
And if we're helping somebody, then we're doing good.

892
01:08:15,269 --> 01:08:20,611
So for those reasons, I support the paper, Mr. President, and I'd suggest that we meet the committee of the whole.

893
01:08:20,631 --> 01:08:21,951
Thank you, Mr. President.

894
01:08:22,131 --> 01:08:30,794
I'm happy to withdraw my motion, but I do just want to say that about 25 minutes ago, we were talking about the fact that we're spending a dollar per household per year on rat control.

895
01:08:32,255 --> 01:08:37,077
So if we want to talk about our priorities and what we're doing as a city,

896
01:08:38,087 --> 01:08:42,051
and our city budget to do more with less every year, every year, every year.

897
01:08:42,071 --> 01:08:43,452
I understand the pressures.

898
01:08:43,632 --> 01:08:47,476
I understand that there are a lot of people in this city who need help.

899
01:08:48,076 --> 01:08:53,762
I think we need to have every tool in the toolbox on the table because it is meeting priorities.

900
01:08:53,802 --> 01:08:56,864
It's taking a hundred different things and trying to figure out

901
01:08:57,665 --> 01:08:58,926
How do we move the city forward?

902
01:08:59,046 --> 01:09:02,288
How do we do it without negatively impacting people the best way we can?

903
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:06,670
But when we're talking about 2.5% per year, which is the limit right now, right?

904
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:08,912
That's the tax limit that the state has enforced on us.

905
01:09:09,592 --> 01:09:10,653
It's below inflation.

906
01:09:10,913 --> 01:09:14,035
It's below the inflation and the health care costs that the city pays every year.

907
01:09:14,055 --> 01:09:17,097
It's below the inflation and the salary costs that the city pays every year.

908
01:09:17,457 --> 01:09:21,699
We have $100 million street and sidewalk backlog, but we have a fire headquarters that needs to be built.

909
01:09:21,739 --> 01:09:23,180
We have a high school that's falling apart.

910
01:09:23,661 --> 01:09:25,342
So if we're going to talk about, you know,

911
01:09:26,022 --> 01:09:33,711
when talking both sides of our mouths, we need to talk about what are we doing to address the long-term trends and issues in this city that people want to see fixed.

912
01:09:34,252 --> 01:09:36,735
We get what we pay for, and that's the result.

913
01:09:36,975 --> 01:09:37,876
We're living with the result.

914
01:09:38,743 --> 01:09:42,184
We live with $100 million street and sidewalk backlog that I hear about every day.

915
01:09:42,865 --> 01:09:45,446
So if you ask seniors, how can we give you options?

916
01:09:45,486 --> 01:09:48,347
How can we give you help to keep the city more affordable?

917
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:52,728
And you're saying, well, you know, we can do this deferment, we can do an exemption.

918
01:09:53,049 --> 01:09:56,190
I talked about an owner occupied exemption, which I think can help a lot of people.

919
01:09:56,930 --> 01:10:09,460
is the solution or the opposite to say your sidewalk's not gonna be safe for you to walk down, that you're gonna have someone in a wheelchair falling out of a wheelchair because the sidewalk is broken or the street is broken or you can't cross the street because there's a 50-year-old light?

920
01:10:10,280 --> 01:10:19,407
I mean, so if we're gonna talk about the needs and priorities of this community and the budget that we have versus the budget that we deserve, we need every tool in the toolbox on the table.

921
01:10:19,687 --> 01:10:20,968
I'm withdrawing my motion.

922
01:10:21,028 --> 01:10:22,470
I'm more than fine to talk about

923
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:25,712
with the solicitor and figuring out how to make this work.

924
01:10:26,112 --> 01:10:38,199
But on the larger picture and the larger puzzle, it can't just be telling residents, do more with less, do more with less, do more with less, or telling city staff, do more with less, do more with less, because that's what we have right now, and it hasn't worked.

925
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:44,403
DPWs at half staff, a third of what it should be.

926
01:10:44,523 --> 01:10:48,446
City departments are all over the place with half as many people as need to be there.

927
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:52,930
to get the job done, that's a major issue too.

928
01:10:53,191 --> 01:10:54,936
And we need to look at it holistically.

929
01:10:55,723 --> 01:10:57,443
We need every piece of the puzzle.

930
01:10:57,483 --> 01:10:58,904
We need every tool in our toolbox.

931
01:10:58,964 --> 01:11:00,844
I agree we should have more commercial development.

932
01:11:00,924 --> 01:11:01,844
How are we gonna do that?

933
01:11:02,364 --> 01:11:04,745
I agree that we should be helping people who are in need.

934
01:11:05,145 --> 01:11:08,545
And whether it's five people or 5,000 people, we should do that.

935
01:11:08,985 --> 01:11:22,808
But at the end of the day, do more with less leads to the results that we've gotten for a long time, which is we don't have the infrastructure, the services, or the buildings that people wanna see, that people deserve to provide basic services.

936
01:11:23,644 --> 01:11:25,967
So that's a piece of this puzzle as well.

937
01:11:26,407 --> 01:11:28,770
And if we're going to talk about it, we have to talk about the whole thing.

938
01:11:28,810 --> 01:11:35,578
And I don't think we should be leaving anything on the, on the sideline when we're talking about how to solve the problems that people in this city want to see solved.

939
01:11:37,013 --> 01:11:37,293
Thank you.

940
01:11:37,333 --> 01:11:38,534
Councilor Morrell.

941
01:11:39,374 --> 01:11:39,935
Thank you, Mr. President.

942
01:11:40,075 --> 01:11:42,596
I'm happy to change my motion to send it to Committee of the Whole.

943
01:11:42,616 --> 01:11:46,539
I mean, to Vice President Knight's point, we want to make sure we get this right.

944
01:11:46,939 --> 01:11:49,580
We have until, I believe, April to figure this out.

945
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:55,364
I would like to have, if possible, have that meeting as soon as possible so people know what's coming down the pike and we can get this set.

946
01:11:56,084 --> 01:11:58,746
But I'm fine to send it to Committee of the Whole.

947
01:11:58,766 --> 01:11:59,586
Councilor Moxley.

948
01:12:00,106 --> 01:12:01,087
Thank you, Mr. President.

949
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:06,210
I guess it's easy to always try to throw money at a problem.

950
01:12:07,131 --> 01:12:11,914
and not look at what currently exists and how you can work more efficiently, Mr. President.

951
01:12:12,755 --> 01:12:25,503
And, you know, it's easy to go back to the well unless you've paid a tax, unless you had to make a decision between your mortgage or your food or your medicine.

952
01:12:25,903 --> 01:12:29,585
So it's easy to talk in theory unless you actually lived that.

953
01:12:30,626 --> 01:12:32,828
And there's people in our community living it right now.

954
01:12:34,150 --> 01:12:46,583
So my concern, Mr. President, is not looking at a tax deferment that currently may assist a half a dozen people, and then if we change it, it assists a dozen people.

955
01:12:47,344 --> 01:12:49,446
That's being disingenuous.

956
01:12:49,527 --> 01:12:52,109
That's saying, oh, look what we're doing to assist.

957
01:12:53,207 --> 01:12:56,831
The issue is, Mr. President, the tax burden on our residents.

958
01:12:57,471 --> 01:13:00,455
That's the issue, not deferring someone's taxes.

959
01:13:01,035 --> 01:13:07,682
How magnanimous is that, that we'll keep on raising your taxes, may even go up over two and a half, but we'll let you defer it at 5%.

960
01:13:07,922 --> 01:13:10,205
I don't hear anyone talking about the 5%.

961
01:13:11,526 --> 01:13:13,127
That gets brushed under the rug.

962
01:13:13,428 --> 01:13:15,990
At 5%, we'll let you defer your taxes.

963
01:13:16,370 --> 01:13:29,662
So Mrs. McGlynn on High Street, we know you can't afford it, but on top of that, we're gonna charge you an additional 5% and we're gonna raise your taxes even higher than they were last year.

964
01:13:30,302 --> 01:13:31,363
That's how great we are.

965
01:13:31,423 --> 01:13:37,869
That's how much we care about the people on fixed incomes and the seniors and the families that are struggling right now.

966
01:13:38,725 --> 01:13:49,069
So I believe that, and I've seen this budget grow over the years, Mr. President, and city services have not gotten any better with the increase in budget.

967
01:13:49,529 --> 01:13:51,090
So it is a matter of priorities.

968
01:13:51,750 --> 01:14:00,633
And my priority would be to set a standard, Mr. President, when we talk about city services, that would be a standard that's set, that's currently not there.

969
01:14:01,253 --> 01:14:02,894
We have the money to operate this city.

970
01:14:03,854 --> 01:14:05,935
There's plenty of money to operate this city.

971
01:14:07,710 --> 01:14:09,692
We just have to work smarter, Mr. President.

972
01:14:09,732 --> 01:14:16,877
We got to be more efficient and we have to rely on those that have given to this community over the years and say, you know what?

973
01:14:17,258 --> 01:14:23,723
We're not going to force you out of the community now because we want to all of a sudden address everything under the sun.

974
01:14:24,423 --> 01:14:29,047
And if it takes a two and a half override, no one wants to talk about two and a half override.

975
01:14:31,069 --> 01:14:33,731
They'll come to the one yard line, but they won't push it over.

976
01:14:34,151 --> 01:14:36,033
No one wants to talk about a two and a half override.

977
01:14:37,745 --> 01:14:42,647
But if you listen carefully, you'll hear two and a half override.

978
01:14:43,147 --> 01:14:46,828
You'll hear the mumblings of a two and a half override, Mr. President.

979
01:14:49,009 --> 01:14:52,950
And I don't want to be there in a year from now telling residents, I told you so.

980
01:14:54,731 --> 01:14:57,672
That was the intent from the beginning, a two and a half override.

981
01:15:00,453 --> 01:15:02,634
And there's all this talk about affordability.

982
01:15:04,782 --> 01:15:09,726
How affordable is it when you have to move out of the city because you can't afford your taxes, Mr. President?

983
01:15:11,987 --> 01:15:12,348
Thank you.

984
01:15:13,128 --> 01:15:13,709
Councilor Falco.

985
01:15:14,409 --> 01:15:15,250
Thank you, Mr. President.

986
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:28,920
I want to thank my colleagues for their thoughts on this, because I could definitely see both sides, but I agree with Councilor Knight that this should go to Committee of the Whole for further review and discussion with the city solicitor and the city assessor.

987
01:15:28,980 --> 01:15:32,243
So I would second that motion to move it to Committee of the Whole.

988
01:15:33,744 --> 01:15:33,944
Thank you.

989
01:15:35,878 --> 01:15:36,398
Thank you, Mr. President.

990
01:15:36,458 --> 01:15:39,300
I just want to reiterate my point that this is a state program.

991
01:15:39,880 --> 01:15:42,722
I agree with what everyone said about just using all the tools in our toolbox.

992
01:15:42,802 --> 01:15:44,262
It's something that's easy for us to do.

993
01:15:44,803 --> 01:15:48,245
It's something we talked about revisiting, you know, a year and a half ago.

994
01:15:48,725 --> 01:15:53,568
It's something that Housing Medford, I believe, first came to the council about, like, three years ago.

995
01:15:54,248 --> 01:15:56,489
So that's all I'm advocating for.

996
01:15:56,549 --> 01:16:02,352
And I hope my colleagues will agree to send this to the committee to further discuss.

997
01:16:02,573 --> 01:16:02,853
Thank you.

998
01:16:03,883 --> 01:16:05,363
Mr. President.

999
01:16:05,984 --> 01:16:14,326
And like I said from the beginning, I support this and I've supported this and any other tax deferment and tax exemption for the last 20 years.

1000
01:16:14,346 --> 01:16:15,486
So I've been consistent on this.

1001
01:16:15,886 --> 01:16:21,988
What I've been advocating against Mr. President is the steady increase of taxes over the years.

1002
01:16:22,608 --> 01:16:28,949
And then the recent dialogue and discussion in this community about a prop two and a half override.

1003
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:30,690
That's what's getting me, Mr. President.

1004
01:16:31,772 --> 01:16:32,633
That's what's getting me.

1005
01:16:32,993 --> 01:16:43,083
And that's going to hurt a lot of good, hardworking people, a lot of seniors in this community, a lot of families that are struggling to make ends meet, sending their kids to school and so forth.

1006
01:16:43,343 --> 01:16:55,835
And unless you're in that predicament, Mr. President, unless you've paid a tax, unless you've had to make a decision between food or medication or whether you're going to stay in your home, you really don't understand the issue.

1007
01:16:57,074 --> 01:17:04,037
And giving a tax deferment is not the solve-all that's going to help a few limited people, Mr. President.

1008
01:17:04,197 --> 01:17:05,158
That's what it boils down to.

1009
01:17:05,338 --> 01:17:24,907
But if the council wants to spin their wheels on that and not talk about the larger issues on how we're going to operate a city, Mr. President, with the current infrastructure that we have and the current taxes that we have, then it's going to keep on going on and on, and it's going to be a never-ending race to the top, Mr. President.

1010
01:17:24,927 --> 01:17:25,227
Thank you.

1011
01:17:26,740 --> 01:17:42,648
If I could put my two cents in there, you know, uh, being the senior citizen now in the room, uh, I, I see things a little different now than I said, because now, um, my council council marks mentioned, uh, we were all house rich.

1012
01:17:43,389 --> 01:17:44,930
I'm one of those people that are very house rich.

1013
01:17:45,750 --> 01:17:47,631
Um, where do I, where do I go with my house?

1014
01:17:48,205 --> 01:18:03,121
I move out of the community can't say near the other otherwise say I say well, but a lot of people want to understand this when you reach a certain age like I am you know the advice that you're given is to take the house out of your name and put in your children's name.

1015
01:18:04,705 --> 01:18:12,948
So in the event you go into a nursing home or something like that, so these people are no longer eligible for the senior tax rate anymore.

1016
01:18:13,469 --> 01:18:14,869
So everybody forgets about that.

1017
01:18:14,889 --> 01:18:19,611
And there's a lot of people in the community that, yes, they're living in, you know, you're living out,

1018
01:18:20,431 --> 01:18:29,080
You know, they've turned the house over to the children because in the event they have to go into a nursing home or something, they don't want to lose their home.

1019
01:18:29,361 --> 01:18:33,425
But now they're no longer eligible for the tax breaks that seniors get.

1020
01:18:33,805 --> 01:18:35,627
And people seem to forget that, let's say.

1021
01:18:36,568 --> 01:18:38,589
I'm the, uh, I'm the senior citizens up here now.

1022
01:18:39,029 --> 01:18:46,013
I, you know, I, you know, and, uh, and I, I'm hearing advice that I'm being given what to do with my house, you know, things like that.

1023
01:18:46,233 --> 01:18:54,798
So please take that in mind that when we talk about, uh, giving the breaks, the people that live in the house that really don't own the house anymore.

1024
01:18:55,278 --> 01:18:57,299
So that's, that's, that's part of the problem too.

1025
01:18:57,619 --> 01:19:03,062
So, and I just say, when we, when we go into that discussion, please take that in, uh, into consideration.

1026
01:19:05,964 --> 01:19:06,104
Yeah.

1027
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:08,981
On the motion by Councilor Rao, do you wanna send that?

1028
01:19:09,001 --> 01:19:14,122
I'm sorry, we have, Mr. Castagnetti, name and address of the record, please.

1029
01:19:15,602 --> 01:19:18,763
Andrew Castagnetti, can you hear me?

1030
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:20,283
We can hear you.

1031
01:19:21,924 --> 01:19:23,124
Thank you, Mr. Calviello.

1032
01:19:23,724 --> 01:19:28,486
Mr. President, I just wanted to add a few comments.

1033
01:19:29,406 --> 01:19:33,927
Councilor Marks is absolutely correct, he speaks perfectly.

1034
01:19:34,838 --> 01:19:39,000
As a matter of fact, I wish he was mayor for the last 10 years in this community.

1035
01:19:42,621 --> 01:19:50,984
Anyways, we have a perfect solution that I've been presenting to the council for at least 17 years.

1036
01:19:52,705 --> 01:20:01,608
And that is to help the unoccupied real estate owner through a Massachusetts state law.

1037
01:20:02,828 --> 01:20:12,173
And that's called Chapter 59, Section 5C, Massachusetts law, owner-occupied real estate tax exemption.

1038
01:20:13,334 --> 01:20:24,360
And simply put, it would save the average homeowner in our city who live in their house, it's an 85% perfect solution, about $2,300 per year.

1039
01:20:30,695 --> 01:20:38,297
We've been missing out on this exemption since its inception, when Chelsea got into it, when the state started in 1998.

1040
01:20:39,277 --> 01:20:53,661
If we averaged $1,000 that we lost, we overpaid for the last 20-something years, that's over $20,000, not counting juice, meaning interest.

1041
01:20:54,762 --> 01:20:57,842
That's, to me, it's like robbery of the people.

1042
01:20:58,423 --> 01:20:59,903
And a lot of us are seniors.

1043
01:21:00,705 --> 01:21:06,130
House rich for sure, cash poor with cigarettes at $13 per pack.

1044
01:21:07,711 --> 01:21:11,955
Anyways, I can't understand why the city does not adopt it.

1045
01:21:12,535 --> 01:21:23,085
If four out of seven counselors adopt it, the mayor says, yes, it's done, and a snap of a finger with the state house.

1046
01:21:23,465 --> 01:21:23,905
We get it.

1047
01:21:25,187 --> 01:21:25,867
End of story.

1048
01:21:26,147 --> 01:21:26,648
By the way,

1049
01:21:27,370 --> 01:21:31,353
An override never happened in this community since I've been here for over 60 years.

1050
01:21:33,415 --> 01:21:33,715
Never.

1051
01:21:34,355 --> 01:21:42,521
We're not Winchester with multiple overrides of Barbara Anderson's prop two and a half, rest her soul.

1052
01:21:43,542 --> 01:21:44,483
And nor have we done any

1053
01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:50,193
debt exclusions like Winchester High School did for their high school for $100 million.

1054
01:21:50,473 --> 01:22:03,660
And my old friend, the bookie from Tough Spark, was on South Border Road living in Winchester, says, Andrew, this thing cost me 800 bucks per year for the next 20 years to pay you off the Winchester New High School.

1055
01:22:05,401 --> 01:22:06,142
This is nuts.

1056
01:22:06,722 --> 01:22:07,563
We're having troubles.

1057
01:22:08,043 --> 01:22:09,484
Forget two and a half overrides.

1058
01:22:09,884 --> 01:22:10,864
You already have $180 million plus budget.

1059
01:22:14,277 --> 01:22:16,418
Just cut the fat and get the job done.

1060
01:22:16,598 --> 01:22:16,998
Good night.

1061
01:22:19,359 --> 01:22:20,319
Thank you, Mr. Kessling.

1062
01:22:20,359 --> 01:22:24,621
Remember, when you cut someone's taxes, then someone else's taxes are going to have to get raised.

1063
01:22:26,922 --> 01:22:27,762
Point of information.

1064
01:22:29,363 --> 01:22:31,284
May I make a counterpoint, please?

1065
01:22:31,984 --> 01:22:32,624
It's important.

1066
01:22:33,424 --> 01:22:34,025
Councilor Knight.

1067
01:22:35,245 --> 01:22:40,667
I think it's important to point out, Mr. President, when we set the tax rate this past year at $9.43 per thousand dollars of valuation for residential properties,

1068
01:22:43,542 --> 01:22:46,584
One thing that we did discuss was the residential property tax exemption.

1069
01:22:47,265 --> 01:22:55,251
And when we went through this exercise in determining whether or not that would be something that was good for the community, I believe what was established was a break-even point of $727,000.

1070
01:22:55,551 --> 01:22:58,673
So any home that was valued over $727,000 that was owner-occupied would not see

1071
01:23:05,452 --> 01:23:11,895
an increase in the tax bill of the percentage that we so chose to apply.

1072
01:23:11,915 --> 01:23:18,958
In fact, what they'd see would be an increase in their tax bill above and beyond what their regular taxation would be without an owner-occupied exemption.

1073
01:23:19,519 --> 01:23:28,123
So there are over 4,000 homes in this community, Mr. President, that are over the $727,000 breakeven point, and over 1,300 of those homes are occupied by individuals that are senior citizens.

1074
01:23:33,105 --> 01:23:41,328
So that is why the Metro City Council, when we set the tax rate, did not adopt the residential exemption, if I remember correctly, Mr. President.

1075
01:23:41,368 --> 01:23:46,409
But I just want to get that out there, because I know Mr. Castagnetti asked why that wasn't adopted.

1076
01:23:46,649 --> 01:23:55,072
And that's why, because there are 4,000 homes that are owner-occupied in this community that would see an increase in the tax bill, not a decrease in the tax bill.

1077
01:23:55,472 --> 01:23:57,273
and with the breakeven of $727,000 a few.

1078
01:23:57,373 --> 01:24:06,055
We're an owner-occupied home owner, say, in East Ford, at a two-family home.

1079
01:24:06,415 --> 01:24:09,576
It sounds like you may actually be above and beyond that breakeven point.

1080
01:24:09,696 --> 01:24:13,357
You could actually probably see an increase in your taxes, not that owner-occupied exemption.

1081
01:24:13,937 --> 01:24:18,278
So that's why the council did not adopt it in the past, historically speaking, Mr. President.

1082
01:24:18,499 --> 01:24:19,099
Mr. President?

1083
01:24:19,499 --> 01:24:19,879
Council Bass.

1084
01:24:20,420 --> 01:24:30,045
And to that point exactly, one of the questions I asked when we discussed it, well, if we know how many are above the break-even and we know how many seniors live in those units, how many below the break-even and how many seniors live in those units?

1085
01:24:31,025 --> 01:24:32,586
And this zero-sum game is killing us.

1086
01:24:32,726 --> 01:24:33,506
I don't disagree.

1087
01:24:34,006 --> 01:24:35,187
The state has set our laws.

1088
01:24:35,227 --> 01:24:38,108
They've said, you know, these are your rules.

1089
01:24:38,168 --> 01:24:38,869
It's zero-sum.

1090
01:24:39,869 --> 01:24:41,390
Somebody does more, somebody does less.

1091
01:24:41,950 --> 01:24:45,432
I'd be happy for us to find an alternative and ask the state to let us do it.

1092
01:24:46,291 --> 01:25:00,657
You know, we could be talking about progressive rates, we could be talking about a graduated rate system, but at the end of the day, what you just said, if there's 4,000 above, you know, that means there's as many as 11,000 below, given how many structures and households there are in the city.

1093
01:25:01,537 --> 01:25:06,039
And if we're talking about what Councilor Marks is talking about, which is helping the people who are closest to the edge,

1094
01:25:07,003 --> 01:25:08,785
Maybe that's part of the answer.

1095
01:25:09,205 --> 01:25:15,772
So if everything's zero sum, then we're going to be putting our wheels through the mud and not going anywhere.

1096
01:25:16,313 --> 01:25:18,955
And that's the position that state law has decided to leave us in.

1097
01:25:19,216 --> 01:25:21,578
So at a certain point,

1098
01:25:22,646 --> 01:25:26,147
I don't think people are going to say, well, you know, that's it.

1099
01:25:26,387 --> 01:25:27,107
That's the answer.

1100
01:25:27,127 --> 01:25:28,268
It's zero sum.

1101
01:25:28,328 --> 01:25:33,569
And we just got to sit here and, uh, you know, twist in the wind until somebody comes and saves us.

1102
01:25:34,070 --> 01:25:39,791
I think we need to have a plan to address these problems, to assess our needs and meet those needs.

1103
01:25:41,712 --> 01:25:44,073
If you want to tax a non-auto occupier, then rent score.

1104
01:25:47,031 --> 01:25:50,233
You know, people elect us to make hard decisions, Mr. President.

1105
01:25:51,654 --> 01:25:53,275
People elect us to make difficult decisions.

1106
01:25:53,295 --> 01:25:54,116
And we make them every day.

1107
01:25:55,276 --> 01:25:55,837
Make them every day.

1108
01:25:55,857 --> 01:25:56,877
All right.

1109
01:25:56,958 --> 01:26:00,500
So on the motion by Councilor Morrell, do you send this to a committee of the whole?

1110
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,340
Yes.

1111
01:26:01,380 --> 01:26:02,081
Seconded by?

1112
01:26:02,861 --> 01:26:03,162
Seconded.

1113
01:26:03,562 --> 01:26:04,743
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

1114
01:26:05,103 --> 01:26:08,605
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1115
01:26:08,925 --> 01:26:09,566
Absolutely.

1116
01:26:09,926 --> 01:26:10,186
Yes.

1117
01:26:11,447 --> 01:26:12,007
Councilor Falco?

1118
01:26:12,227 --> 01:26:12,467
Yes.

1119
01:26:12,748 --> 01:26:13,448
Vice President Knight?

1120
01:26:13,528 --> 01:26:13,788
Yes.

1121
01:26:13,988 --> 01:26:14,509
Councilor Martins?

1122
01:26:14,589 --> 01:26:14,869
Yes.

1123
01:26:15,189 --> 01:26:15,750
Councilor Morrell?

1124
01:26:15,950 --> 01:26:16,130
Yes.

1125
01:26:16,848 --> 01:26:17,568
Councilor Scarpelli?

1126
01:26:18,349 --> 01:26:18,609
Yes.

1127
01:26:19,870 --> 01:26:20,570
President Caravaglio?

1128
01:26:20,790 --> 01:26:21,751
Yes, I'm in the affirmative.

1129
01:26:21,831 --> 01:26:22,591
Motion passes.

1130
01:26:23,472 --> 01:26:36,399
21578 offered by Vice President Knight being so resolved that the Memphis City Council requests that the city administration take the appropriate steps to have the exposed castings along Mystic Avenue clearly marked in identifiable.

1131
01:26:36,459 --> 01:26:37,220
Vice President Knight.

1132
01:26:38,020 --> 01:26:42,423
Well, Mr. President, if anything happened to me at the barbershop the other day,

1133
01:26:43,368 --> 01:26:50,670
as I drove down Main Street and merged onto Mystic Avenue, then was right in front of Exploit Towing.

1134
01:26:51,631 --> 01:26:55,172
The pavement gets a little milled, a little rocky.

1135
01:26:55,212 --> 01:26:56,412
There's some construction going on.

1136
01:26:56,692 --> 01:27:02,934
And there's a number of castings, Mr. President, along that stretch and further down where they're doing this work that aren't clearly marked.

1137
01:27:03,634 --> 01:27:05,995
And I got two flat tires.

1138
01:27:06,475 --> 01:27:12,456
driving down Mr. Cab the other day, Mr. President, on Wednesday night, because the casting wasn't clearly marked and I nailed it.

1139
01:27:13,236 --> 01:27:29,440
And as I was commiserating over my experience at the coffee shop just the other day with Tom Tedford from Export Towing, he started laughing and told me that he does between 15 and 20 tires a week right at that location, Mr. President.

1140
01:27:29,620 --> 01:27:31,620
So something's wrong there.

1141
01:27:31,760 --> 01:27:35,441
Something needs to be done to protect those that are traveling by motor vehicle,

1142
01:27:36,011 --> 01:27:38,934
uh, down Mr. Gavin new during this construction season.

1143
01:27:39,194 --> 01:27:44,158
Um, you know, we're all anxious and looking forward to seeing Mr. Gap be fully resurfaced.

1144
01:27:44,218 --> 01:27:54,848
But in the meantime, um, the 15 to 20 tires a week to get torn up, that's 15 to 20 taxpayers in this community, uh, that are going to be put through an inordinate inconvenience.

1145
01:27:55,568 --> 01:28:01,093
And, um, also what we're going to see, Mr. President is a rising claims, the property damage against the city.

1146
01:28:01,753 --> 01:28:05,254
If in fact, we don't take the appropriate steps to properly mock these castings.

1147
01:28:05,894 --> 01:28:19,258
So with that being said, I ask everybody to feel bad for me because they have two flat tires in my car and also move approval on the paper so that we can get the area or at Mystic Gap a little bit safer during this construction period, Mr. President.

1148
01:28:19,493 --> 01:28:19,973
That's a moral.

1149
01:28:20,274 --> 01:28:21,254
Thank you, Mr President.

1150
01:28:21,314 --> 01:28:23,055
Thanks, Vice President Knight for bringing this forward.

1151
01:28:23,456 --> 01:28:26,918
And as you say, it's something that's an inconvenience in a car, in a bike, on a bike.

1152
01:28:27,098 --> 01:28:27,979
It's catastrophic.

1153
01:28:28,079 --> 01:28:29,400
So I would like love.

1154
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:30,681
Thank you for bringing this forward.

1155
01:28:30,701 --> 01:28:31,681
I would love to see this change.

1156
01:28:32,022 --> 01:28:32,362
Thank you.

1157
01:28:33,423 --> 01:28:37,645
And I was I understand it was it was five last night right at the same spot.

1158
01:28:37,685 --> 01:28:41,388
So yeah, I think the city is going to have a little bit of a debate going forward.

1159
01:28:41,688 --> 01:28:45,271
So Mr. President, what about the impact on export?

1160
01:28:45,311 --> 01:28:46,552
Tell me.

1161
01:28:46,692 --> 01:28:46,932
He said

1162
01:28:49,317 --> 01:28:51,198
Supporting business in our community.

1163
01:28:52,939 --> 01:28:58,183
So the motion by Vice President seconded by excuse me.

1164
01:29:01,045 --> 01:29:02,246
Name and address of the record please.

1165
01:29:02,446 --> 01:29:03,987
Nate Merritt, 373 Riverside Ave.

1166
01:29:04,687 --> 01:29:13,373
Besides marking, is it possible that there's something you could put around the casting so that you can drive over paint and you'll still wind up with a flat tire?

1167
01:29:14,401 --> 01:29:22,568
But I can't imagine that there isn't something around the casting that slopes so that if you do happen to drive over it, you don't wind up with the flat tire and you can see it.

1168
01:29:23,368 --> 01:29:24,509
Just something to consider.

1169
01:29:24,609 --> 01:29:25,210
I'm a desk geek.

1170
01:29:25,230 --> 01:29:33,556
I don't know what the best practices are or what they use out there in the construction field, but I'm sure that they get something better than my idea out there.

1171
01:29:33,576 --> 01:29:34,277
I'm sure of that.

1172
01:29:34,497 --> 01:29:36,879
All in the motion by Vice President Hayes.

1173
01:29:36,919 --> 01:29:37,459
Seconded by?

1174
01:29:37,479 --> 01:29:38,020
Second.

1175
01:29:38,460 --> 01:29:39,441
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

1176
01:29:39,461 --> 01:29:40,442
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1177
01:29:43,483 --> 01:29:43,763
Yes.

1178
01:29:44,983 --> 01:29:45,223
Yes.

1179
01:29:45,463 --> 01:29:46,004
Yes.

1180
01:29:46,044 --> 01:29:47,044
Yes.

1181
01:29:47,304 --> 01:29:48,304
Yes.

1182
01:29:48,504 --> 01:29:49,744
Yes.

1183
01:29:51,945 --> 01:29:52,285
Yes.

1184
01:29:54,305 --> 01:29:54,565
Yes.

1185
01:29:55,245 --> 01:30:10,388
70 affirmative motion passes 21579 of a vice president night being so resolved that the city council requests that the city engineer restrict the hours of construction for the project the budding the Brooke school to begin following the start of school, including the information

1186
01:30:10,968 --> 01:30:21,056
implementation of road closures and be further resolved that storage and staging equipment materials and debris on public ways be relocated to a more suitable location.

1187
01:30:21,356 --> 01:30:22,117
Vice President Knight.

1188
01:30:22,737 --> 01:30:23,678
Yes, Mr. President.

1189
01:30:24,198 --> 01:30:39,130
After having a whole summer off the first day of school, the city decided that it would be a good day to start a water main project on the roads abutting being Prescott Street, which I'm pretty sure you're familiar with.

1190
01:30:39,938 --> 01:30:56,173
And over the course of time as the presidents in school, open those some six or seven weeks ago, what we're seeing is on various days certain roads are closed, no vehicular access during drop off period that coupled with the fact that we have, you know, gigantic dumpster construction materials and debris.

1191
01:30:57,313 --> 01:31:04,596
in construction equipment parked along Prescott Street and along other side streets that are above the school, creating a situation that makes it difficult to pass, number one.

1192
01:31:05,317 --> 01:31:10,179
Oddly, number two, and a concern for the children, number three, Mr. President, there in the area.

1193
01:31:11,419 --> 01:31:19,303
It's a request to ask that the city engineer restrict the hours of construction for this project until such time as the students are in school.

1194
01:31:20,263 --> 01:31:22,704
School starts about 8.30 in the morning, Mr. President.

1195
01:31:22,744 --> 01:31:24,705
The construction crews like to get out there at 7 a.m.

1196
01:31:24,785 --> 01:31:24,985
or so.

1197
01:31:25,609 --> 01:31:34,131
and that hour-and-a-half window is creating a certain situation down at the school in terms of traffic gridlock, inconvenience to drop off of parents and the like.

1198
01:31:35,652 --> 01:31:46,015
Yeah, coupled with the fact that if you used to go in a certain way, Mr. President, you'd drive down, say, Old Canal Street, and you'd take a left-hand turn onto Prescott, and then it says Prescott Street's closed.

1199
01:31:46,835 --> 01:31:47,435
What's your option?

1200
01:31:47,455 --> 01:31:50,196
You gotta go over the train tracks, turn all the way around, come back.

1201
01:31:51,336 --> 01:31:52,877
It's just a really inconvenient situation.

1202
01:31:52,917 --> 01:31:53,617
It doesn't really,

1203
01:31:55,822 --> 01:32:00,865
It's not conducive to the free flow of traffic or a safe drive off to children down there in the area, Mr. President.

1204
01:32:00,885 --> 01:32:05,388
So I just ask that the city engineer revisit the practices and hopefully come up with a plan that's a little safer.

1205
01:32:09,620 --> 01:32:10,281
Thank you, Mr. President.

1206
01:32:10,301 --> 01:32:11,902
I want to thank Council and I for bringing this forward.

1207
01:32:11,942 --> 01:32:22,530
I actually had the opportunity to drive by this area a number of times, and this is a major safety concern, especially with the kids in the morning going to school.

1208
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:23,711
It needs to be addressed.

1209
01:32:24,632 --> 01:32:26,974
I think this is a good solution to look at.

1210
01:32:27,715 --> 01:32:35,201
It's definitely a major concern and a major public safety concern with the children just coming and going from the school every morning.

1211
01:32:35,261 --> 01:32:37,963
So I would definitely support this motion and move approval.

1212
01:32:38,929 --> 01:32:39,150
Thank you.

1213
01:32:48,868 --> 01:32:49,908
We had all summer to do this.

1214
01:32:50,068 --> 01:32:55,310
Why did we wait until the day before the kids go to school to do this?

1215
01:32:55,390 --> 01:33:02,051
And we just got through paving High Street, and now we're digging up sections of High Street that were just newly paved.

1216
01:33:02,771 --> 01:33:04,312
So that's our realm over the city.

1217
01:33:04,352 --> 01:33:05,052
We do a new street.

1218
01:33:05,572 --> 01:33:06,692
A couple of weeks later, we pave it.

1219
01:33:07,232 --> 01:33:09,453
We rip it up, and it never gets fixed correctly.

1220
01:33:10,353 --> 01:33:12,894
And like I say, Councilor Nights says, I live over there.

1221
01:33:13,514 --> 01:33:16,795
There's a dumpster full of pipes that's leaking rusty water.

1222
01:33:18,397 --> 01:33:19,420
Again, the road's unpaved.

1223
01:33:19,782 --> 01:33:20,264
Try it.

1224
01:33:20,284 --> 01:33:21,087
There's equipment there.

1225
01:33:22,554 --> 01:33:23,795
Try getting around that.

1226
01:33:23,815 --> 01:33:25,316
That's a tough thing to get around with.

1227
01:33:25,616 --> 01:33:31,000
Even with other things, with all the parents dropping kids off in their driveway, it's a real tough thing.

1228
01:33:31,020 --> 01:33:36,585
And then, say, that dumpster just moves down, and now it's right next door to the school today.

1229
01:33:37,225 --> 01:33:40,167
I say, you had plenty of time to do this.

1230
01:33:41,008 --> 01:33:43,130
I don't know why we waited till the last second.

1231
01:33:43,230 --> 01:33:47,373
I don't know why we waited till we paved High Street to dig up these things.

1232
01:33:47,893 --> 01:33:51,276
Again, we've got to get a little more coordination of these projects.

1233
01:33:52,727 --> 01:33:54,989
No, again, thank you, Councilor Night for bringing this up.

1234
01:33:55,670 --> 01:33:58,712
So on the motion by Vice President Night, seconded by?

1235
01:33:59,072 --> 01:33:59,333
Second.

1236
01:33:59,813 --> 01:34:00,834
Seconded by Councilor Falco.

1237
01:34:01,415 --> 01:34:02,375
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1238
01:34:04,777 --> 01:34:05,358
Councilor Paris?

1239
01:34:05,598 --> 01:34:05,858
Yes.

1240
01:34:06,139 --> 01:34:06,599
Councilor Falco?

1241
01:34:06,619 --> 01:34:06,839
Yes.

1242
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:07,900
Vice President Night?

1243
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:08,260
Yes.

1244
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:08,981
Councilor Marks?

1245
01:34:09,021 --> 01:34:09,301
Yes.

1246
01:34:09,521 --> 01:34:10,142
Councilor Morrell?

1247
01:34:10,262 --> 01:34:10,482
Yes.

1248
01:34:10,723 --> 01:34:11,443
Councilor Scarpelli?

1249
01:34:13,185 --> 01:34:13,465
Yes.

1250
01:34:14,726 --> 01:34:15,487
President Caravaglia?

1251
01:34:15,967 --> 01:34:17,989
Yes, 70 in favor of the motion passes.

1252
01:34:19,016 --> 01:34:19,516
Mr. President.

1253
01:34:21,117 --> 01:34:21,678
Councilor Falcone.

1254
01:34:21,698 --> 01:34:26,002
May I ask that we merge 21580 and 21581.

1255
01:34:26,262 --> 01:34:30,025
Yes, I was going to ask you that.

1256
01:34:30,186 --> 01:34:34,289
If I may, Councilor Knight, if I may, Councilor Knight as a co-sponsor to 21581.

1257
01:34:34,329 --> 01:34:35,190
Thank you.

1258
01:34:35,210 --> 01:34:35,450
So, 21580 and 21581.

1259
01:34:44,957 --> 01:34:49,678
581 offered by President Caraviello and Councilor Falco and Vice President Knight.

1260
01:34:51,139 --> 01:34:57,200
Being so resolved, the Memphis City Council sends its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of Mary O'Sullivan on her recent passing.

1261
01:34:57,220 --> 01:35:01,301
Mary was a member of the ladies of Sodality and Mother's Club.

1262
01:35:01,681 --> 01:35:03,661
Her presence in our community will be missed.

1263
01:35:04,241 --> 01:35:04,882
Vice President Knight.

1264
01:35:07,322 --> 01:35:11,483
Mr. President, as Councilor Falco has added me to his resolution, I defer to him first.

1265
01:35:13,177 --> 01:35:14,978
Thank you, President Caviello.

1266
01:35:15,558 --> 01:35:22,780
I just wanted to offer my sincere condolences to the O'Sullivan family on Mary's recent passing.

1267
01:35:22,860 --> 01:35:26,861
She was a lifelong resident and a very active member at St.

1268
01:35:26,901 --> 01:35:28,841
Francis Parish for many, many years.

1269
01:35:29,381 --> 01:35:30,602
Our thoughts and prayers to the family.

1270
01:35:30,762 --> 01:35:31,082
Thank you.

1271
01:35:31,628 --> 01:35:32,168
Vice President Knight.

1272
01:35:32,448 --> 01:35:33,709
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1273
01:35:33,769 --> 01:35:36,750
Yes, Mary was someone who always loved watching the city council meetings.

1274
01:35:36,850 --> 01:35:41,631
And I remember quite frequently talking with her daughter and granddaughter about the goings on in town.

1275
01:35:41,871 --> 01:35:51,015
And every once in a while, we'd get a request from Mary's daughter or granddaughter asking for a congratulations or a birthday shout out to Mary.

1276
01:35:51,075 --> 01:35:52,735
And she really got a kick out of it.

1277
01:35:52,975 --> 01:35:54,096
She was a great person.

1278
01:35:54,116 --> 01:35:54,956
She raised a great family.

1279
01:35:55,316 --> 01:35:56,456
And she's going to be sadly missed.

1280
01:35:56,757 --> 01:36:00,778
So to Lauren Feldstrong and you and to the O'Sullivan family.

1281
01:36:02,599 --> 01:36:08,961
And again, as I say, Mary, again, very active in the St.

1282
01:36:09,001 --> 01:36:09,742
Francis community.

1283
01:36:10,362 --> 01:36:13,143
And again, her presence is going to be missed.

1284
01:36:13,403 --> 01:36:14,784
If we could rise for a moment of silence please.

1285
01:36:36,016 --> 01:36:40,441
On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by Vice President Knight.

1286
01:36:40,742 --> 01:36:41,903
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1287
01:36:45,728 --> 01:36:46,268
Councilor Bares?

1288
01:36:46,508 --> 01:36:46,729
Yes.

1289
01:36:46,929 --> 01:36:47,530
Councilor Falco?

1290
01:36:47,610 --> 01:36:47,830
Yes.

1291
01:36:47,850 --> 01:36:48,651
Vice President Knight?

1292
01:36:48,671 --> 01:36:48,991
Yes.

1293
01:36:49,172 --> 01:36:49,712
Councilor Marks?

1294
01:36:49,812 --> 01:36:50,073
Yes.

1295
01:36:50,293 --> 01:36:50,873
Councilor Morrell?

1296
01:36:50,994 --> 01:36:51,214
Yes.

1297
01:36:51,714 --> 01:36:52,415
Councilor Scarpelli?

1298
01:36:53,236 --> 01:36:53,517
Yes.

1299
01:36:54,658 --> 01:36:55,339
President Kerrio?

1300
01:36:55,359 --> 01:36:55,419
Yes.

1301
01:36:56,273 --> 01:36:58,436
Yes, 70 in the affirmative motion passes.

1302
01:36:58,636 --> 01:37:06,989
21582 offered by Councilor Falco will be a result of the DPW repair the pothole in front of 491 High Street in the interest of public safety.

1303
01:37:07,029 --> 01:37:07,650
Councilor Falco.

1304
01:37:08,099 --> 01:37:09,260
Thank you, Mr. President.

1305
01:37:09,681 --> 01:37:13,024
Just asked me if the DPW could fix a pothole.

1306
01:37:13,064 --> 01:37:15,086
It's kind of almost like a depression in the road.

1307
01:37:15,246 --> 01:37:21,773
It looks like there was some road repair work that was done previously, and it just kind of sunk over time.

1308
01:37:21,813 --> 01:37:27,038
So if we could have the DPW go out and repair that sometime soon.

1309
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:30,360
in the interest of public safety, greatly appreciate it.

1310
01:37:30,460 --> 01:37:32,501
It's right in front of the magnificent box.

1311
01:37:32,821 --> 01:37:33,141
Thank you.

1312
01:37:33,422 --> 01:37:35,202
On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by?

1313
01:37:35,663 --> 01:37:36,303
So moved.

01:37:36,863 --> 01:37:38,044
Seconded by Vice President Knight.

1315
01:37:38,224 --> 01:37:39,345
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1316
01:37:40,705 --> 01:37:41,305
Councilor Falco?

1317
01:37:41,506 --> 01:37:41,746
Yes.

1318
01:37:41,926 --> 01:37:42,646
Vice President Knight?

1319
01:37:42,746 --> 01:37:43,026
Yes.

1320
01:37:43,226 --> 01:37:43,767
Councilor Marks?

1321
01:37:43,967 --> 01:37:44,247
Yes.

1322
01:37:44,387 --> 01:37:44,947
Councilor Morales?

1323
01:37:45,127 --> 01:37:45,387
Yes.

1324
01:37:45,508 --> 01:37:46,248
Councilor Scarpelli?

1325
01:37:47,168 --> 01:37:47,428
Yes.

1326
01:37:48,469 --> 01:37:49,169
President Caraballo?

1327
01:37:49,329 --> 01:37:50,230
Yes, I'm in the affirmative.

1328
01:37:50,250 --> 01:37:50,950
The motion passes.

1329
01:37:51,230 --> 01:37:51,530
Yes.

1330
01:37:52,311 --> 01:37:54,432
You didn't call my name.

1331
01:37:54,872 --> 01:37:55,492
I didn't call your name.

1332
01:37:55,753 --> 01:37:55,893
No?

1333
01:37:55,913 --> 01:37:56,293
I'm so sorry.

1334
01:37:59,172 --> 01:38:04,518
I apologize.

1335
01:38:04,538 --> 01:38:05,979
2-1-583 offered by Councilor Falco.

1336
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:19,653
Be it resolved that the Health Department provide the Memphis City Council with the standards and protocols that are being used to test air quality, as well as the frequency of testing in all public buildings within the City of Memphis.

1337
01:38:19,673 --> 01:38:20,354
Councilor Falco.

1338
01:38:20,674 --> 01:38:28,489
Thank you, Mr. President, especially with COVID-19 still with us and the new Delta variant.

1339
01:38:28,930 --> 01:38:31,254
It's important that we keep up with the

1340
01:38:32,835 --> 01:38:35,396
air testing, air quality testing in all our public buildings.

1341
01:38:35,876 --> 01:38:42,497
It's important that the city has a plan in place to ensure the ventilation systems in the city buildings that they're checked regularly.

1342
01:38:42,517 --> 01:38:48,839
You know, sometimes they're checked mechanically, other times it's just a, you know, a technician comes in to check the air quality.

1343
01:38:49,379 --> 01:38:53,520
But I just wanted to get a report back from the administration with regard to

1344
01:38:54,880 --> 01:39:03,645
how these buildings are being checked, how often they're being checked, and are they being checked mechanically, or is someone coming in and actually physically checking these buildings?

1345
01:39:03,665 --> 01:39:10,189
So if we could get an update from the administration as soon as possible with regard to all city buildings.

1346
01:39:10,209 --> 01:39:17,513
So that would be schools and city hall, library, fire stations, police stations, all city buildings.

1347
01:39:17,934 --> 01:39:18,254
Thank you.

1348
01:39:18,674 --> 01:39:20,315
So all in the motion by Councilor Falco.

1349
01:39:21,075 --> 01:39:21,556
Seconded by?

1350
01:39:22,778 --> 01:39:23,699
Second by Vice President Nye.

1351
01:39:23,719 --> 01:39:24,820
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1352
01:39:27,182 --> 01:39:27,342
Yes.

1353
01:39:27,362 --> 01:39:27,482
Yes.

1354
01:39:27,602 --> 01:39:27,842
Yes.

1355
01:39:28,062 --> 01:39:28,343
Yes.

1356
01:39:38,900 --> 01:39:40,681
Yes, 7 in the affirmative motion passes.

1357
01:39:41,281 --> 01:39:52,484
21584 offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the DPW install crosswalks at the intersection of Cherry Street and Salem Street and Almond Street and Salem Street in the interest of public safety.

1358
01:39:52,504 --> 01:39:53,224
Councilor Falco.

1359
01:39:53,704 --> 01:39:54,805
Thank you, Mr. President.

1360
01:39:55,005 --> 01:40:00,967
I received a call from a resident down in the Cherry Street area recently regarding their

1361
01:40:04,307 --> 01:40:07,649
student or a child walking to school to the Roberts in the morning.

1362
01:40:07,669 --> 01:40:17,333
And, uh, from Haines square to the Roberts, there's pretty much crosswalks all the way through that neighborhood with the exception of Cherry street and Salem street, Almond street and Salem street.

1363
01:40:17,893 --> 01:40:27,478
So in the public interest of public safety, if we could have, uh, the DPW at some crosswalks to those, uh, those sections that I just outlined, I greatly appreciate it.

1364
01:40:27,718 --> 01:40:28,018
Thank you.

1365
01:40:28,538 --> 01:40:32,540
On the motion by councilor Falco seconded by

1366
01:40:33,876 --> 01:40:34,737
Seconded by Councilor Baez.

1367
01:40:34,757 --> 01:40:35,957
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1368
01:40:41,941 --> 01:40:42,242
Yes.

1369
01:40:42,262 --> 01:40:42,642
Yes.

1370
01:40:42,662 --> 01:40:42,942
Yes.

1371
01:40:43,463 --> 01:40:43,623
Yes.

1372
01:40:43,643 --> 01:40:43,723
Yes.

1373
01:40:53,150 --> 01:40:55,050
Yes, seven affirmative motion passes.

1374
01:40:55,070 --> 01:41:06,792
2-1-585 offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the Memphis City Council extend its deepest and sincere condolences to the family of retired Memphis firefighter Joseph Cantalupa on his recent passing.

1375
01:41:07,213 --> 01:41:07,913
Councilor Falco.

1376
01:41:07,933 --> 01:41:10,973
If I may add, Councilor Knight, to this as well.

1377
01:41:12,994 --> 01:41:17,514
Recently, Mr. Joseph Cantalupa, a retired Memphis firefighter, passed away.

1378
01:41:17,534 --> 01:41:19,955
When we see

1379
01:41:21,450 --> 01:41:23,751
Joe, he would always be at Firefighter Sunday.

1380
01:41:23,771 --> 01:41:24,792
You'd see him every year there.

1381
01:41:25,512 --> 01:41:28,214
He had breakfast with them.

1382
01:41:28,254 --> 01:41:36,058
I think actually, Mr. President, you and myself actually had, we had breakfast with him this past, Firefighter Sunday, this past May.

1383
01:41:36,438 --> 01:41:40,801
And great guy from all accounts, a firefighter's firefighter.

1384
01:41:41,881 --> 01:41:46,644
You know, he would do anything and it was just thoughts of praise to the family.

1385
01:41:47,204 --> 01:41:50,126
And of course, thank you to his family for

1386
01:41:50,880 --> 01:41:52,801
his continuous commitment to the community.

1387
01:41:53,101 --> 01:41:54,142
Thank you.

1388
01:41:54,262 --> 01:41:55,143
Thank you.

1389
01:41:55,203 --> 01:41:56,363
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1390
01:41:56,684 --> 01:42:07,170
As most of you know, I have a background in organized labor, and when it comes to someone that was a fiery advocate for his membership, you couldn't find anybody better than Joe.

1391
01:42:08,631 --> 01:42:10,793
When you talk to the current firefighters that have

1392
01:42:11,473 --> 01:42:20,701
been around for a long time, that can share some of those old stories about what it was like negotiating contracts and going into the war room and fighting for what you need.

1393
01:42:20,961 --> 01:42:28,567
They said that Joe was just quite a leader, Mr. President, someone whose actions spoke louder than his words, someone who wasn't afraid to fight the good fight.

1394
01:42:29,208 --> 01:42:36,614
He's going to be sadly missed, his efforts, energies, and certainly his commitment to Local 1032 will not go unnoticed.

1395
01:42:37,074 --> 01:42:37,855
Everybody I've talked to

1396
01:42:38,870 --> 01:42:40,611
has only had fond things to say about it.

1397
01:42:41,252 --> 01:42:47,359
And everybody I've talked to has said what a legend that this gentleman was in terms of advocating and fighting for his members.

1398
01:42:49,120 --> 01:42:49,441
Thank you.

1399
01:42:49,881 --> 01:42:50,342
Councillor Marks.

1400
01:42:50,962 --> 01:42:51,803
Thank you, Mr. President.

1401
01:42:51,823 --> 01:42:56,068
I want to thank Councillor Falco and Vice President Knight for putting this on.

1402
01:42:57,749 --> 01:42:59,010
I've known Joe for a lot of years.

1403
01:42:59,730 --> 01:43:03,453
When I first got on the council, Joe used to come to that podium.

1404
01:43:04,033 --> 01:43:11,078
And let me tell you, you couldn't meet a man that was more animated when it came to issues impacting not only the fire department.

1405
01:43:11,238 --> 01:43:16,502
He was a strong advocate, as Council Vice President Knight mentioned, for his union members.

1406
01:43:17,042 --> 01:43:20,944
But he was also a very strong advocate for the residents of this community.

1407
01:43:21,505 --> 01:43:35,173
And he'd be the first to stand up and make sure that we had the appropriate apparatus out there to make sure residents were safe, make sure that the firefighters had the latest and greatest equipment to make sure that residents were safe, Mr. President.

1408
01:43:35,853 --> 01:43:42,660
And he truly spent his time advocating, not just on the local level, but on the state level as well.

1409
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:54,010
He was a fixture at the state house advocating for laws and additional funding, anything that would assist firefighters in their job, Mr. President, therefore making residents safer.

1410
01:43:54,331 --> 01:43:56,193
So he will be sorely missed, Mr. President.

1411
01:43:56,213 --> 01:43:56,513
Thank you.

1412
01:43:58,432 --> 01:44:06,116
Um, and I say, like Councilor Fevella said, we had the privilege of having breakfast with him, uh, this year at the firehouse, uh, during the fireman's memorial.

1413
01:44:06,196 --> 01:44:09,698
And, uh, and you say, you know, Joe was, uh, he was the fireman's friend.

1414
01:44:09,738 --> 01:44:13,120
He was there, he was there for his men all the time, and he always did the right thing.

1415
01:44:13,140 --> 01:44:18,023
So again, uh, again, Joe's another gentleman that will be, uh, missed in our community.

1416
01:44:18,823 --> 01:44:20,204
So, Councilor Best.

1417
01:44:21,425 --> 01:44:22,846
Uh, we'll rise for a moment of silence.

1418
01:44:44,065 --> 01:44:44,365
Yes.

1419
01:44:48,426 --> 01:44:48,646
Yes.

1420
01:44:48,806 --> 01:44:49,006
Yes.

1421
01:44:50,007 --> 01:44:50,827
Yes.

1422
01:44:52,367 --> 01:44:52,727
Yes.

1423
01:44:53,788 --> 01:44:54,028
Yes.

1424
01:44:56,988 --> 01:44:57,249
Yes.

1425
01:44:59,349 --> 01:44:59,549
Yes.

1426
01:44:59,869 --> 01:45:09,992
7 affirmative motion passes 2, 1, 5, 8, 6 of my council Falco may resolve that the administration provide a city hall staffing update to the Memphis city council council Falco.

1427
01:45:10,690 --> 01:45:11,510
Thank you, Mr. President.

1428
01:45:11,530 --> 01:45:25,014
There have been a number of, let's see, postings recently with regard to open positions throughout the city hall, and just wanted to get an update with regard to where we are, where the administration is to filling these positions.

1429
01:45:25,534 --> 01:45:26,875
I've been interviewing people.

1430
01:45:27,095 --> 01:45:30,036
A lot of these are very important positions.

1431
01:45:30,056 --> 01:45:32,576
We need to get them staffed as soon as possible.

1432
01:45:32,596 --> 01:45:37,478
So I just want to get an update from the administration as to where we are with regard to having them finally staffed.

1433
01:45:37,738 --> 01:45:38,018
Thank you.

1434
01:45:38,888 --> 01:45:41,149
Thank you.

1435
01:45:41,269 --> 01:45:46,031
Mister president on that point, I know that I believe it was Council of faculty with all the turnover and stuff.

1436
01:45:46,071 --> 01:45:52,173
I'm not sure we asked at this point, I think it might have been either Dave Rodriguez when he was here or at least not only when she was here.

1437
01:45:52,973 --> 01:46:02,176
If we could get a copy of the organizational chart after the passage of this last budget, we saw a couple of new departments get created, a couple of new positions get created, Mr. President.

1438
01:46:02,577 --> 01:46:06,018
And there was a lot of talk and discussion about what this organizational chart was going to look like.

1439
01:46:06,558 --> 01:46:09,300
before all the turnover in the corner office occurred.

1440
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:16,586
I was wondering, I know we've asked for it, I don't think we've received it, so I wonder if we could just reiterate that request, Mr. President, to get a copy of the organizational chart.

1441
01:46:19,803 --> 01:46:21,084
Are you making that as an amendment?

1442
01:46:21,244 --> 01:46:21,744
I would love to.

1443
01:46:21,965 --> 01:46:22,245
Thank you.

1444
01:46:22,265 --> 01:46:23,446
Councilor Falcone.

1445
01:46:23,526 --> 01:46:24,246
Thank you, Mr. President.

1446
01:46:24,707 --> 01:46:26,428
I agree with Councilor Knight 100%.

1447
01:46:26,908 --> 01:46:29,170
We should get an updated organizational chart.

1448
01:46:29,590 --> 01:46:35,434
I just want to make sure that it includes the names of the people that are serving in those roles.

1449
01:46:35,514 --> 01:46:39,197
I know we received an organizational chart during the budget.

1450
01:46:41,481 --> 01:46:44,682
You just have positions that reported to the mayor, didn't have the names.

1451
01:46:44,782 --> 01:46:48,603
I think it's key that we have all the names within the organizational charts.

1452
01:46:48,623 --> 01:46:50,303
You can actually know who reports to who.

1453
01:46:51,084 --> 01:46:56,025
Um, so, uh, as simple as task as that may seem, uh, they couldn't get it to us months ago.

1454
01:46:56,045 --> 01:46:57,425
Hopefully they can get it to us now.

1455
01:46:57,666 --> 01:47:00,546
Thank you.

1456
01:47:01,447 --> 01:47:02,947
We may actually have already asked for this.

1457
01:47:02,967 --> 01:47:06,508
I'm not a hundred percent sure, but if you'd be so amenable to having an amendment

1458
01:47:07,274 --> 01:47:11,856
that we get a specific update on the parking department and the status of hiring in that department.

1459
01:47:12,316 --> 01:47:17,238
I know that's included in here, but I think it's important given what Councilor Knight said about that being a new department.

1460
01:47:18,959 --> 01:47:25,122
We're two months, two and a half months away from shifting over to city managed parking enforcement.

1461
01:47:26,262 --> 01:47:27,583
That's why I would like to have that in there.

1462
01:47:27,663 --> 01:47:28,003
Thank you.

1463
01:47:29,023 --> 01:47:32,845
Mr. President, on that note, actually, here we are now where

1464
01:47:33,817 --> 01:47:35,818
about a quarter of the way is in.

1465
01:47:35,918 --> 01:47:40,279
Next week, I will be putting forward my request for an update on the city's financial health.

1466
01:47:40,559 --> 01:47:45,741
That was a request that this council have put forward a resolution this council passed asking for quarterly updates from our CFO.

1467
01:47:46,421 --> 01:47:48,562
But right now, I don't believe we have a CFO.

1468
01:47:50,154 --> 01:47:54,417
So I think it's very important that we have this financial update ASAP.

1469
01:47:54,437 --> 01:47:58,520
So I'm asking, Mr. President, that you get in advance of me putting this on the agenda.

1470
01:47:58,560 --> 01:48:06,126
Rob, make sure you reach out to the administration and let them know that that's coming so that we can possibly have some- You can send me an email on that tomorrow, what you want, and I will take care of that.

1471
01:48:06,166 --> 01:48:06,646
Certainly will.

1472
01:48:06,686 --> 01:48:07,287
Thank you very much.

1473
01:48:07,647 --> 01:48:13,392
So on the motion by Councilor Falco, as amended by Councilor Baez, seconded by-

1474
01:48:15,808 --> 01:48:18,130
And also as amended by Councilor, by Vice President Knight.

1475
01:48:20,372 --> 01:48:22,454
And by Councilor Falco again.

1476
01:48:23,254 --> 01:48:25,276
So on the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by?

1477
01:48:27,077 --> 01:48:28,098
Seconded by Councilor Baez.

1478
01:48:28,218 --> 01:48:29,339
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1479
01:48:34,684 --> 01:48:35,344
Councilor Baez?

1480
01:48:35,584 --> 01:48:35,804
Yes.

1481
01:48:36,025 --> 01:48:36,565
Councilor Falco?

1482
01:48:36,645 --> 01:48:36,845
Yes.

1483
01:48:37,065 --> 01:48:37,766
Vice President Knight?

1484
01:48:37,826 --> 01:48:38,086
Yes.

1485
01:48:38,266 --> 01:48:38,787
Councilor Parks?

1486
01:48:38,947 --> 01:48:39,287
Yes.

1487
01:48:39,467 --> 01:48:40,048
Councilor Morrell?

1488
01:48:40,208 --> 01:48:40,428
Yes.

1489
01:48:40,708 --> 01:48:41,429
Councilor Scarpelli?

1490
01:48:42,050 --> 01:48:42,330
Yes.

1491
01:48:45,060 --> 01:48:46,881
Yes, 7 in the affirmative motion passes.

1492
01:48:47,602 --> 01:48:56,867
21587 offered by Councilor Falco, be it resolved that the administration provide an update regarding the upcoming leadership transition within the Medford Fire Departments.

1493
01:48:57,207 --> 01:48:58,008
Councilor Falco.

1494
01:48:58,268 --> 01:48:59,148
Thank you, Mr. President.

1495
01:48:59,168 --> 01:49:06,313
We were just talking about Firefighter Sunday, and I remember when Chief Gilberti gave his speech this past year, he had mentioned

1496
01:49:06,933 --> 01:49:10,214
that it would be his last speech and that he was going to be retiring.

1497
01:49:10,254 --> 01:49:12,615
I think it was going to be November, the end of November.

1498
01:49:13,175 --> 01:49:25,539
So this is basically asking the administration to get an update with regard to the transition, how that process is going, and generally just to get an update.

1499
01:49:25,579 --> 01:49:29,181
We really haven't been given any update with regard to this process whatsoever.

1500
01:49:29,201 --> 01:49:31,921
I think we definitely deserve an update.

1501
01:49:34,206 --> 01:49:35,347
approve their budget every year.

1502
01:49:35,967 --> 01:49:42,130
This is something that we should know about, and we've received very little information so far about this process.

1503
01:49:42,610 --> 01:49:51,514
So it'd be nice to get an update, or I'm actually asking for an update from the administration that we've received an update with regard to this process in the timeline as to when it's going to take place.

1504
01:49:51,794 --> 01:49:52,114
Thank you.

1505
01:49:52,754 --> 01:49:53,135
Thank you.

1506
01:49:53,795 --> 01:49:54,255
Second.

1507
01:49:54,595 --> 01:49:56,916
On the motion by Councilor Bailão, seconded by?

1508
01:49:56,936 --> 01:49:57,096
Seconded.

1509
01:49:58,257 --> 01:49:59,257
Seconded by Councilor Baez.

1510
01:49:59,277 --> 01:50:00,158
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1511
01:50:04,518 --> 01:50:04,738
Yes.

1512
01:50:05,779 --> 01:50:06,100
Yes.

1513
01:50:06,921 --> 01:50:07,321
Yes.

1514
01:50:08,262 --> 01:50:09,364
Yes.

1515
01:50:10,305 --> 01:50:10,605
Yes.

1516
01:50:12,848 --> 01:50:13,068
Yes.

1517
01:50:13,389 --> 01:50:16,732
70 affirmative motion passes two one five eight eight off of my council Falco.

1518
01:50:17,113 --> 01:50:23,661
We resolved that the administration provided an update regarding the staffing at community media council Falco.

1519
01:50:24,194 --> 01:50:25,195
Thank you, Mr. President.

1520
01:50:25,235 --> 01:50:31,722
This is similar to the previous resolution about staffing in general, but this is specific to message community media.

1521
01:50:32,783 --> 01:50:37,609
Patrick Gordon, who helped us for so long with regard to council meetings.

1522
01:50:38,253 --> 01:50:40,034
And he also worked at Memphis Community Media.

1523
01:50:40,495 --> 01:50:49,281
It's just basically asking for an update as to how the interview process is going for the position since he left for another community.

1524
01:50:49,721 --> 01:50:52,082
Just want to know, have they interviewed anyone?

1525
01:50:52,122 --> 01:50:55,725
Are they close to getting anyone to replace Patrick?

1526
01:50:56,505 --> 01:50:59,728
So I'd like to request that update from the administration.

1527
01:51:00,028 --> 01:51:00,408
Thank you.

1528
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:00,908
Thank you.

1529
01:51:01,289 --> 01:51:03,710
On the motion by Councilor Falco, seconded by?

1530
01:51:04,391 --> 01:51:04,771
Second.

1531
01:51:05,271 --> 01:51:06,232
Seconded by Councilor Marks.

1532
01:51:06,492 --> 01:51:07,553
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1533
01:51:13,509 --> 01:51:13,769
Yes.

1534
01:51:13,969 --> 01:51:15,891
Yes.

1535
01:51:15,971 --> 01:51:16,331
Yes.

1536
01:51:17,652 --> 01:51:18,952
Yes.

1537
01:51:21,454 --> 01:51:21,734
Yes.

1538
01:51:23,575 --> 01:51:23,775
Yes.

1539
01:51:23,876 --> 01:51:24,556
Affirmative.

1540
01:51:24,896 --> 01:51:25,617
Motion passes.

1541
01:51:25,897 --> 01:51:29,879
Motion to take papers on the suspension by Councilor Falco, seconded by Vice President Knight.

1542
01:51:29,919 --> 01:51:30,920
Mr. Cliff, please call the roll.

1543
01:51:40,067 --> 01:51:42,148
President, can we take up public participation?

1544
01:51:42,188 --> 01:51:45,630
We do have someone in the audience that would like to speak on Riverside Ave.

1545
01:51:45,710 --> 01:51:47,251
We have one more paper to go first.

1546
01:51:48,532 --> 01:51:49,233
We have one more paper.

1547
01:51:49,553 --> 01:51:50,293
Under suspension?

1548
01:51:50,453 --> 01:51:50,633
Yes.

1549
01:51:51,274 --> 01:51:52,515
Okay, this is right on the agenda.

1550
01:51:52,955 --> 01:51:53,155
Okay.

1551
01:51:53,575 --> 01:51:53,795
Okay.

1552
01:51:58,418 --> 01:51:58,858
I'll roll, please.

1553
01:52:00,019 --> 01:52:00,519
Councilor Perks?

1554
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:01,040
Yes.

1555
01:52:01,640 --> 01:52:02,200
Councilor Falcon?

1556
01:52:02,340 --> 01:52:02,601
Yes.

1557
01:52:03,261 --> 01:52:03,961
Vice President Knight?

1558
01:52:04,442 --> 01:52:05,102
What are we voting on?

1559
01:52:05,803 --> 01:52:06,923
Suspending the vote to take the intervention.

1560
01:52:06,963 --> 01:52:07,664
Under suspension.

1561
01:52:07,744 --> 01:52:07,884
Yes.

1562
01:52:10,198 --> 01:52:18,663
Yes, yes, yes, yes, affirmative motion passes.

1563
01:52:20,124 --> 01:52:34,752
On the suspension, people number 21589 off of my vice president night being so resolved that the Memphis City Council extended Stephen's congratulations to Maria and Michael price on their momentous occasion of the 50th wedding anniversary.

1564
01:52:34,993 --> 01:52:35,713
Vice president night.

1565
01:52:36,140 --> 01:52:37,761
Mr. President, thank you very much.

1566
01:52:37,821 --> 01:52:46,807
These two lovebirds met back at Medford High School some many years ago and have forged a beautiful relationship and have raised a beautiful family.

1567
01:52:47,488 --> 01:52:53,451
They've become grandparents, still reside in the South Medford neighborhood of this great city, Mr. President.

1568
01:52:53,571 --> 01:53:03,438
Just this past weekend, surrounded by friends and family, they were surprised at their daughter-in-law's house for a 50th wedding anniversary, Mr. President, and for all accounts,

1569
01:53:04,136 --> 01:53:05,738
From what I understand, it was a great success.

1570
01:53:06,199 --> 01:53:08,021
Michael and Marie were both very, very surprised.

1571
01:53:08,241 --> 01:53:09,523
They had no idea that it was happening.

1572
01:53:10,102 --> 01:53:13,423
And if you know Michael and Marie, you'll know that they're two people that are just great individuals.

1573
01:53:14,123 --> 01:53:21,384
If you're looking for them, you can probably find them down at La Conte Skating Rink, because between their kids and their grandkids, that's where they spend the majority of their time.

1574
01:53:22,124 --> 01:53:32,806
But they're great family people, pictures in the self-benefit neighborhood, as I said, Mr. President, and they've been able to tolerate each other for 50 years with love, bliss, and kindness.

1575
01:53:33,106 --> 01:53:36,146
And it's something that I look forward to celebrating someday with my wife.

1576
01:53:36,206 --> 01:53:39,467
So I'm very proud of them and very happy for them, and I wish them all the best.

1577
01:53:41,087 --> 01:53:46,813
On the motion by Vice President Knight, seconded by Councilor Falco, please call the roll.

1578
01:53:50,677 --> 01:53:50,837
Yes.

1579
01:53:50,857 --> 01:53:50,957
Yes.

1580
01:53:50,997 --> 01:53:51,258
Yes.

1581
01:53:51,538 --> 01:53:51,758
Yes.

1582
01:54:02,509 --> 01:54:05,910
Yes, 7 affirmative motion passes.

1583
01:54:05,990 --> 01:54:11,972
Motion to revert back to regular business by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Behrs.

1584
01:54:12,513 --> 01:54:13,813
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1585
01:54:19,555 --> 01:54:20,055
Councilor Behrs?

1586
01:54:20,396 --> 01:54:20,636
Yes.

1587
01:54:20,796 --> 01:54:21,276
Councilor Talbot?

1588
01:54:21,316 --> 01:54:21,396
Yes.

1589
01:54:21,976 --> 01:54:22,676
Vice President Banks?

1590
01:54:23,137 --> 01:54:23,537
Yes.

1591
01:54:23,617 --> 01:54:24,137
Councilor Marks?

1592
01:54:24,297 --> 01:54:24,597
Yes.

1593
01:54:25,157 --> 01:54:25,718
Councilor Morrell?

1594
01:54:25,858 --> 01:54:26,038
Yes.

1595
01:54:39,004 --> 01:54:41,585
Yes, 60 affirmative, one absent, motion passes.

1596
01:54:42,666 --> 01:54:45,889
We have public participation.

1597
01:54:46,329 --> 01:54:56,617
Yes, we have our resident Nate Merritt, Mr. President, from Riverside Ave that would like to address the issue of national grids work taking place at the corner of Locust and Riverside Ave.

1598
01:54:57,282 --> 01:54:58,643
Good evening, name and address of the record, please.

1599
01:54:58,983 --> 01:55:00,364
Mayor, 373 Riverside Ave.

1600
01:55:01,324 --> 01:55:06,687
So a lot of you have actually met since 2017 when I moved in here, and there's been a lot of excitement on the corner of my street.

1601
01:55:06,747 --> 01:55:08,348
It's a busy area, understand that.

1602
01:55:08,388 --> 01:55:10,369
We now have Wegmans right at the Meadow Glen Mall.

1603
01:55:10,389 --> 01:55:18,693
I had a car crash through my house the first year I came through here, so I kind of understand what it means when there's an emergency that happens, especially in the middle of the night that might wake you up.

1604
01:55:18,853 --> 01:55:22,555
Literally, the foundation of my house shook, and there was like bricks flying from the house next door.

1605
01:55:23,616 --> 01:55:25,757
I know you work here at Councilor Behrs,

1606
01:55:27,528 --> 01:55:29,129
Yeah, it was kind of a disaster.

1607
01:55:30,750 --> 01:55:33,472
I felt bad for the car too, actually, when I saw it.

1608
01:55:33,912 --> 01:55:38,375
So that said, I do try to come here and not just complain, but also offer some solutions if we can.

1609
01:55:38,495 --> 01:55:39,696
So that's really my goal.

1610
01:55:40,857 --> 01:55:42,097
That said, I'm also now a dad.

1611
01:55:42,618 --> 01:55:44,679
So since I've moved here, some things have changed.

1612
01:55:44,699 --> 01:55:47,341
I have a 13-month-old son who's actually not feeling well tonight.

1613
01:55:47,441 --> 01:55:49,842
So I'm going to go home and probably have to take care of him.

1614
01:55:51,063 --> 01:55:56,306
So definitely some shifting priorities, just like you, Mr. President, in terms of your age, mine also.

1615
01:55:57,067 --> 01:56:08,674
So now that I have a newborn, a couple weeks ago, starting on October 20th, I put my kid to bed and around nine o'clock at night, all of a sudden it's like, all right, what's going on here?

1616
01:56:08,694 --> 01:56:09,835
And in fact, I wasn't home.

1617
01:56:09,855 --> 01:56:12,756
My wife put the kid to bed and I went to come in.

1618
01:56:12,796 --> 01:56:18,880
I couldn't get in my own driveway because someone decided they were going to dig a hole in front of my house to go fix a gas leak.

1619
01:56:19,781 --> 01:56:20,141
Excellent.

1620
01:56:20,749 --> 01:56:24,715
Thank you for fixing gas leaks, especially when they need to be fixed.

1621
01:56:24,755 --> 01:56:27,659
So no gripes with that, especially as it's approaching winter.

1622
01:56:28,380 --> 01:56:32,506
Let's not try to fix gas leaks in the wintertime if we learned anything from the North Andover instance.

1623
01:56:33,126 --> 01:56:33,206
OK.

1624
01:56:34,268 --> 01:56:36,792
So that said, hey, how long would this take?

1625
01:56:37,782 --> 01:56:38,803
No notice whatsoever.

1626
01:56:39,323 --> 01:56:41,824
And I'm not the only resident that was like, oh, what's going on?

1627
01:56:41,865 --> 01:56:43,726
Didn't even know they were necessarily fixing a gas leak.

1628
01:56:43,766 --> 01:56:50,930
It's got the giant national grid truck and they've been poking holes in that intersection for the past four years, chasing gas leaks here, there, everywhere.

1629
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:54,872
So jackhammer in the middle of the night, right?

1630
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:58,635
Going through the middle of the night to like three, four in the morning, what's going on?

1631
01:56:59,692 --> 01:57:09,300
So when I came back the next night and said, hi, what's, you know, there's no one really to talk to, and I'm not going to go walk in a construction zone, but there are some nice police officers on both ends where they shut down the street.

1632
01:57:10,021 --> 01:57:11,442
And of course, I want to go home.

1633
01:57:11,502 --> 01:57:14,164
Where do I put my car so I can get home?

1634
01:57:16,066 --> 01:57:18,668
Not very good answers from one officer that asked it.

1635
01:57:18,688 --> 01:57:19,309
Sorry, I don't know.

1636
01:57:19,349 --> 01:57:20,490
You have to go talk to someone and see.

1637
01:57:22,323 --> 01:57:24,244
Well, someone hired you for the detail.

1638
01:57:24,724 --> 01:57:29,867
And I know when they have these jobs that they list the details and who can sign up to actually work the road job.

1639
01:57:29,887 --> 01:57:31,468
So that was kind of a poor answer.

1640
01:57:31,628 --> 01:57:33,729
Didn't really like that one.

1641
01:57:34,209 --> 01:57:35,190
So I tried to do some homework.

1642
01:57:35,210 --> 01:57:40,612
I actually wrote an email eventually to, cause this lasted for like a week, Monday through Friday.

1643
01:57:40,793 --> 01:57:42,053
And what's going on here?

1644
01:57:42,093 --> 01:57:45,975
We're starting work at nine o'clock and it's wrapping up, you know, three, four in the morning.

1645
01:57:45,995 --> 01:57:47,136
I'm trying to keep the kid asleep.

1646
01:57:48,165 --> 01:57:49,987
and my neighbors are asking, what's going on?

1647
01:57:50,367 --> 01:57:51,548
None of us have any answers.

1648
01:57:52,368 --> 01:57:53,890
So they stopped for the weekend.

1649
01:57:53,970 --> 01:57:54,730
Oh, they must be done.

1650
01:57:55,411 --> 01:57:57,613
No, they started up Monday morning back at it.

1651
01:57:57,653 --> 01:58:03,277
So that's when I, you know, send an email, asked the chief engineer McGivern, what's going on?

1652
01:58:04,138 --> 01:58:07,781
And the answer I get is, oh, well, I don't approve anything during the day.

1653
01:58:07,841 --> 01:58:12,225
You'll have, you know, we'll do some homework, but you know, it's the chief of police.

1654
01:58:12,265 --> 01:58:13,065
Is that chief Buckley?

1655
01:58:13,206 --> 01:58:13,586
Is that right?

1656
01:58:14,066 --> 01:58:14,206
No.

1657
01:58:14,607 --> 01:58:14,807
Okay.

1658
01:58:15,547 --> 01:58:15,748
So

1659
01:58:17,453 --> 01:58:21,035
Finally get a response, oh, this is an emergency, it had to happen at night.

1660
01:58:22,196 --> 01:58:23,677
It's an emergency, got it.

1661
01:58:23,937 --> 01:58:26,239
Takes a week to fix an emergency for a gas leak.

1662
01:58:27,019 --> 01:58:29,661
Apparently takes two weeks, because that's how long this thing took.

1663
01:58:30,622 --> 01:58:32,903
We couldn't give anyone in the neighborhood any notice.

1664
01:58:33,784 --> 01:58:38,427
Couldn't find a slip in my mailbox, something on my door, right?

1665
01:58:38,487 --> 01:58:39,847
I get those in the mail all the time.

1666
01:58:40,008 --> 01:58:41,428
Those work fine, they come great.

1667
01:58:42,289 --> 01:58:44,751
Nobody could walk around and put something in there.

1668
01:58:46,066 --> 01:58:49,789
Who's the person, the community person from National Grid that we contacted?

1669
01:58:49,889 --> 01:58:50,490
Dan Cameron.

1670
01:58:50,870 --> 01:58:51,231
Yes.

1671
01:58:51,431 --> 01:58:52,952
So, I spoke with Dan Cameron.

1672
01:58:53,032 --> 01:58:56,335
He said, oh yeah, apparently, and he was nice, very nice, very cordial.

1673
01:58:57,055 --> 01:58:58,817
Apparently, there was a failure in communication.

1674
01:58:59,537 --> 01:59:02,059
My point is, this isn't the first time this has happened.

1675
01:59:02,099 --> 01:59:10,205
In fact, in June of 2019, there was a sewer lining project on Locust Street that someone decided was a good idea to put a, you know,

1676
01:59:10,946 --> 01:59:18,010
basically make a giant hissing noise for hours starting at 10 o'clock at night and they said, oh, we didn't realize it was going to make noise in the neighborhood.

1677
01:59:18,631 --> 01:59:19,772
There's people that live there.

1678
01:59:19,812 --> 01:59:21,853
There's people that get up in the morning to go to work.

1679
01:59:21,913 --> 01:59:23,814
They have kids, they have, you know, so on and so forth.

1680
01:59:23,854 --> 01:59:24,895
And there's a lot of residents.

1681
01:59:26,396 --> 01:59:34,201
I think we need to do better, especially communicating if projects are going to happen at night, whether they're emergencies or not, we can put some signs out.

1682
01:59:34,841 --> 01:59:38,043
And the mayor offered a solution that was, well,

1683
01:59:38,557 --> 01:59:41,860
Even if National Grid doesn't, we'll send out a robocall.

1684
01:59:42,120 --> 01:59:44,181
So I'm going to pick on you for a second, Councilor Falco.

1685
01:59:44,582 --> 01:59:45,222
You have a cell phone?

1686
01:59:45,603 --> 01:59:46,223
I do, right here.

1687
01:59:46,563 --> 01:59:46,864
Awesome.

1688
01:59:47,184 --> 01:59:48,525
So you get phone calls on it.

1689
01:59:48,905 --> 01:59:49,065
Yes.

1690
01:59:49,285 --> 01:59:50,847
Do you get spam calls on your phone?

1691
01:59:50,907 --> 01:59:51,067
Yes.

1692
01:59:51,367 --> 01:59:53,949
What happens when you get a phone number you don't recognize?

1693
01:59:54,129 --> 01:59:55,050
You probably don't answer it.

1694
01:59:55,110 --> 01:59:56,571
You probably don't answer it.

1695
01:59:56,611 --> 02:00:01,115
So you think you're going to wind up necessarily hearing the phone call, the robocall?

1696
02:00:01,535 --> 02:00:02,776
That's not a good solution.

1697
02:00:04,183 --> 02:00:07,565
And more so is when you go ask for, you know, where's the buck stop?

1698
02:00:07,705 --> 02:00:09,487
Who approved these things at nighttime?

1699
02:00:09,867 --> 02:00:12,049
Why do they have to happen in the middle of the night?

1700
02:00:12,549 --> 02:00:14,590
I understand traffic can be an inconvenience.

1701
02:00:14,991 --> 02:00:15,571
Got it.

1702
02:00:16,031 --> 02:00:17,492
I drive around here too.

1703
02:00:17,772 --> 02:00:19,133
Traffic's always an inconvenience.

1704
02:00:21,415 --> 02:00:28,760
What's the policy in terms of like, how is that determination made besides it's easy for me to get a detail at night versus during the day?

1705
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:30,661
Maybe that's part of the calculus.

1706
02:00:30,942 --> 02:00:31,242
I don't know.

1707
02:00:32,656 --> 02:00:39,545
But I think it would be nice if, you know, maybe this council could take a look at what that logic path is.

1708
02:00:40,386 --> 02:00:44,330
When we start approving projects at night, didn't it generate some noise?

1709
02:00:44,370 --> 02:00:46,633
And I don't know about you, but I would think it's a person.

1710
02:00:49,898 --> 02:00:50,598
of vice president night.

1711
02:00:50,618 --> 02:00:59,023
It's my understanding and when these applications come before us and we read through the application, um, and we, Oh, what are these councils behind this rail last every time?

1712
02:00:59,063 --> 02:00:59,983
What are the hours of this project?

1713
02:01:00,063 --> 02:01:02,004
What are the hours of construction?

1714
02:01:02,445 --> 02:01:03,445
We'll do the hours of construction.

1715
02:01:03,465 --> 02:01:09,809
We'll do construction whenever the city tells us to, whenever the city engineer, whenever the mayor's office tells us to, that's when we'll do it.

1716
02:01:10,729 --> 02:01:11,470
That's when we'll do it.

1717
02:01:11,770 --> 02:01:17,873
So I think what you're getting Nate, quite frankly, is, um, what's that song by blues traveler, the runaround.

1718
02:01:18,633 --> 02:01:19,815
You know, very much so.

1719
02:01:19,855 --> 02:01:29,570
I mean, everyone's pointing, you know, which way, which way the police chief, you know, at the end of the day, the administration determines when the construction is going to be authorized and allowed.

1720
02:01:29,851 --> 02:01:32,395
It's outlined on the permit, the permits issued through the engineering office.

1721
02:01:33,794 --> 02:01:36,236
Well, apparently, according to the engineer, he doesn't authorize the permit.

1722
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:40,180
The police chief authorizes anything when they open the road at night and they do construction at night.

1723
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:43,604
That's a street opening permit, so the police would have to be there for the detail.

1724
02:01:43,644 --> 02:01:44,525
The police get the detail.

1725
02:01:44,865 --> 02:01:45,065
Sure.

1726
02:01:45,265 --> 02:01:47,588
So any road opening has to have the detail there.

1727
02:01:47,688 --> 02:01:50,310
The city engineer signs off on any type of construction.

1728
02:01:50,811 --> 02:01:51,972
The city engineer has to sign off.

1729
02:01:52,773 --> 02:01:54,935
Chief, a police can't say, yeah, go open the street and do construction.

1730
02:01:55,356 --> 02:01:57,037
We always ask the time, the duration.

1731
02:01:58,781 --> 02:02:00,442
I never remember approving anything.

1732
02:02:00,943 --> 02:02:05,448
We have an item on our emergency.

1733
02:02:05,508 --> 02:02:09,752
This was a level one leak that they were aware of.

1734
02:02:09,772 --> 02:02:15,138
Remember we had these discussions when they were talking about the MWRA project with National Grid?

1735
02:02:15,458 --> 02:02:15,718
Yeah.

1736
02:02:18,645 --> 02:02:25,373
This was a level one leak and the chief made the determination not to do the work during the day, but he gave them approval to do it at night.

1737
02:02:25,913 --> 02:02:29,237
So that's why there wasn't proper notification, but I agree.

1738
02:02:29,257 --> 02:02:30,899
There should be some type of notification.

1739
02:02:31,099 --> 02:02:40,149
Well, and especially if it's going to go on, you know, it's supposed to happen a day or two and that like what defines an emergency is a two week project and emergency or is it two week project to project?

1740
02:02:40,429 --> 02:02:41,209
And stuff happens.

1741
02:02:41,390 --> 02:02:43,351
A level one gas leak is an emergency.

1742
02:02:43,611 --> 02:02:44,211
Understood.

1743
02:02:44,231 --> 02:02:45,812
A level one gas leak is an emergency.

1744
02:02:45,832 --> 02:02:46,873
There's no question about that.

1745
02:02:47,013 --> 02:02:48,533
A level one gas leak is an emergency.

1746
02:02:48,874 --> 02:02:56,678
To take two weeks to fix it is a little crazy to me because if it's such an emergency, then shut the street down all day, get it done in a day.

1747
02:02:57,078 --> 02:02:57,618
You know what I mean?

1748
02:02:58,019 --> 02:02:58,919
That's the way I'd look at it.

1749
02:02:59,219 --> 02:03:00,520
But you know, I don't sit over there.

1750
02:03:00,560 --> 02:03:01,180
I sit over here.

1751
02:03:01,761 --> 02:03:09,165
Um, you know, so that's really not, you know, something that, that, that we can control or, or, or, or impact at the time.

1752
02:03:09,285 --> 02:03:09,765
You know what I mean?

1753
02:03:10,599 --> 02:03:11,560
It's just mismanagement.

1754
02:03:12,141 --> 02:03:17,889
If you don't mind, Mr. President, I just have a question.

1755
02:03:18,290 --> 02:03:21,455
Is it one, are they digging in one area or are they moving around?

1756
02:03:22,015 --> 02:03:23,978
So in this particular spot, it was one area.

1757
02:03:24,259 --> 02:03:24,519
Okay.

1758
02:03:24,579 --> 02:03:26,422
And over two weeks, they're digging in the same spot.

1759
02:03:26,989 --> 02:03:32,773
And they would dig and then cover it over for the traffic to go during the day and open it back up.

1760
02:03:32,793 --> 02:03:38,017
So you actually have that lost time too, where it takes them a couple hours to open up the same hole and then cover it back over.

1761
02:03:38,317 --> 02:03:46,743
And if you total those hours up over two weeks, let's say it's like two hours a day times 10 days, that's 20 hours, almost 24 hours worth of work.

1762
02:03:47,283 --> 02:03:49,184
National grid says they'll work 24 seven.

1763
02:03:49,684 --> 02:03:50,965
So I'm with you counselor night.

1764
02:03:51,205 --> 02:03:53,266
If this is an emergency, fix it and get it done.

1765
02:03:53,686 --> 02:03:55,167
Don't drag this out over two weeks.

1766
02:03:55,227 --> 02:03:57,908
And a lot of you have heard plenty of complaints of residents.

1767
02:03:57,928 --> 02:04:04,832
When you hear the airplanes flying overhead, when they're taking off runway three, three, you drag the FAA in here saying, Hey, it's too loud at night.

1768
02:04:04,872 --> 02:04:06,292
It's waking up my kids, blah, blah, blah.

1769
02:04:06,733 --> 02:04:13,056
I challenge you to then deal with someone with a jackhammer outside your house till four in the morning.

1770
02:04:14,082 --> 02:04:15,202
You want to know some noise?

1771
02:04:15,642 --> 02:04:23,304
In fact, I can, you know, I have DB levels that I was measuring and talking about, you know, a thousand times sound that's, you know, happening.

1772
02:04:23,364 --> 02:04:24,244
It's 30 DB, right?

1773
02:04:25,505 --> 02:04:30,446
When they're wearing hearing protection, operating the equipment, it's not just the abutters.

1774
02:04:30,526 --> 02:04:35,067
It's not a magical line that sound then up, it only touches the property lines, sound travels.

1775
02:04:36,827 --> 02:04:40,748
So that's why I think there's maybe we can look at the criteria.

1776
02:04:41,709 --> 02:04:42,929
Yes, it was an emergency.

1777
02:04:43,790 --> 02:04:50,014
But once it starts moving past a couple of days, maybe we're not in emergency territory in terms of how we get the work done.

1778
02:04:51,014 --> 02:04:53,836
Maybe then we take a look and go, hey, this is getting out of hand.

1779
02:04:53,856 --> 02:04:55,797
We can't keep dragging this out over two weeks.

1780
02:04:55,857 --> 02:04:57,178
Let's wrap it up and get it done.

1781
02:04:59,839 --> 02:05:10,525
So I guess my ask of you, is there something that we can do, pass a motion to revisit the logic tree of when work is done at night in this city versus during the day?

1782
02:05:14,268 --> 02:05:14,889
I would hope so.

1783
02:05:14,969 --> 02:05:16,950
And if not, I think that's a problem too.

1784
02:05:17,451 --> 02:05:20,813
And if you guys don't know what that is, that's a problem.

1785
02:05:21,174 --> 02:05:31,862
Mr. Murray, to be honest, we've had probably 10, 15 resolutions since I've been on the council asking, why isn't the Winthrop street project getting done?

1786
02:05:32,162 --> 02:05:34,584
Why, you know, we've had issues around this, around this issue.

1787
02:05:35,125 --> 02:05:36,486
And I think we've pushed

1788
02:05:37,317 --> 02:05:38,459
You know, you're bringing it to us again.

1789
02:05:38,479 --> 02:05:45,210
I'm sure one of us, if not all seven of us, we want to put a motion on next week and say, what the heck is going on with this issue on Riverside Avenue?

1790
02:05:45,972 --> 02:05:47,274
We have been saying to the police chief.

1791
02:05:48,073 --> 02:05:49,294
We need Winthrop Street done this year.

1792
02:05:49,314 --> 02:05:50,594
It's been torn up for five years.

1793
02:05:50,654 --> 02:05:52,055
We need Mystic Ab done this year.

1794
02:05:52,075 --> 02:05:53,255
It's been torn up for five years.

1795
02:05:53,875 --> 02:05:55,736
And there's been delay, delay, delay.

1796
02:05:55,836 --> 02:05:58,117
We were just talking about the Brooks School.

1797
02:05:58,197 --> 02:06:02,139
Why are we having these projects not coordinated?

1798
02:06:02,359 --> 02:06:06,341
Or in this specific case, why is it starting the day that school starts?

1799
02:06:06,381 --> 02:06:11,843
And we had an issue at Medford High School where there were projects going on as the morning rush was trying to get into Medford High School.

1800
02:06:15,004 --> 02:06:15,565
I'm hearing you.

1801
02:06:15,645 --> 02:06:16,365
I agree with you.

1802
02:06:16,405 --> 02:06:18,367
I think we've been pushing on this issue citywide.

1803
02:06:18,768 --> 02:06:27,516
And after saying all of that, my caveat here is when we ask, sometimes we don't get an answer and sometimes we don't get the answer we want to hear.

1804
02:06:27,776 --> 02:06:32,560
And unless someone wants to correct me, we can't order them to do it.

1805
02:06:33,301 --> 02:06:35,103
So I think

1806
02:06:36,605 --> 02:06:45,530
I don't want to speak for everybody else, but I think we will try to get answers here and try to make this solution, find a solution to make this better, or at least better next time.

1807
02:06:46,771 --> 02:06:52,775
But we have been asking those questions and had a very difficult time getting those solutions on promptly.

1808
02:06:52,835 --> 02:06:54,235
So I just want to be honest with you about that.

1809
02:06:54,376 --> 02:06:54,556
Sure.

1810
02:06:54,836 --> 02:07:05,042
And like I said, I'm sure there's rhyme or reason, but you know, sometimes things change and it's good if we can understand and we can communicate what is that decision logic?

1811
02:07:08,698 --> 02:07:20,322
Mr. President, this is probably an ideal time because, Nate, you're probably aware there's going to be a major project done there relatively soon.

1812
02:07:20,382 --> 02:07:21,862
With the MWRA and all that?

1813
02:07:22,082 --> 02:07:24,303
A major, major project that's already been approved.

1814
02:07:24,363 --> 02:07:29,044
So you're talking close to, I think, six, I think it was three to six months.

1815
02:07:29,244 --> 02:07:30,445
We haven't approved that actually.

1816
02:07:30,465 --> 02:07:31,385
It's still on the table.

1817
02:07:32,509 --> 02:07:33,489
Well, I don't know.

1818
02:07:33,849 --> 02:07:35,170
They tried to do that last winter.

1819
02:07:35,810 --> 02:07:36,370
Right, right.

1820
02:07:36,410 --> 02:07:39,530
And we said, that's probably not a good idea to play with gas lines in the winter.

1821
02:07:39,710 --> 02:07:40,831
Well, we asked them to hold off.

1822
02:07:41,191 --> 02:07:43,671
They wanted to do it before Christmas, and we asked them to hold off.

1823
02:07:43,711 --> 02:07:45,171
But it is going to happen.

1824
02:07:45,291 --> 02:07:49,352
It's a major infrastructure improvement that they're making.

1825
02:07:49,412 --> 02:07:51,553
And that's when they told us about the level one gas leaks.

1826
02:07:51,973 --> 02:07:57,854
But I just want to say, Mr. President, when Nate reached out to me, I reached out to Dan Cameron immediately from National Grid.

1827
02:07:58,454 --> 02:07:59,715
And he was very attentive.

1828
02:08:00,116 --> 02:08:02,398
He addresses the issues immediately.

1829
02:08:02,438 --> 02:08:08,084
It may not have been the answer that we wanted, but he immediately responded.

1830
02:08:08,104 --> 02:08:09,745
And I just want to thank Dan Kiff.

1831
02:08:09,845 --> 02:08:10,266
And he did.

1832
02:08:10,286 --> 02:08:13,108
And he owned up and said, you know, they could have done a better job.

1833
02:08:13,249 --> 02:08:14,590
So totally agree.

1834
02:08:16,249 --> 02:08:23,491
But, you know, and in terms of coordination, if you're going to rip open the street again, well, don't pave over Riverside Ave anytime soon until they do that.

1835
02:08:23,931 --> 02:08:29,773
I mean, it's like a war zone there anyways, but, but at least save some money and not let, you know, pave it over and then rip it up again.

1836
02:08:33,654 --> 02:08:38,075
We talked about earlier, just paving brand new streets and ripping them up two days after they were laid down.

1837
02:08:38,895 --> 02:08:48,586
Well, I'll tell you what, if you want to take all the granite curbs and pull them out and give them to the, well, I was going to say they're useless where I am anyways, because there's no curbing left.

1838
02:08:48,646 --> 02:08:50,588
That's a whole nother thing that needs to happen there.

1839
02:08:50,949 --> 02:08:56,895
Take the granite curbs, give them to the gentleman that was talking two weeks ago that was saying, Hey, I need some granite curbs because they're useless to us.

1840
02:08:57,900 --> 02:09:04,925
and then fix the street right after they do the National Grid project, but just don't play with our gas in the wintertime when we depend on it for our heat.

1841
02:09:05,285 --> 02:09:10,169
Because God forbid something goes wrong, you're not running gas lines up on the street.

1842
02:09:10,910 --> 02:09:15,093
Otherwise, I'm coming to bunk in with one of you and my family so we can stay warm in the winter.

1843
02:09:15,153 --> 02:09:16,454
So some of you better sign up.

1844
02:09:17,354 --> 02:09:19,236
Zap, love it.

1845
02:09:19,476 --> 02:09:21,798
I think I live in the smallest house of anyone here.

1846
02:09:24,720 --> 02:09:25,821
So thank you for your time.

1847
02:09:26,501 --> 02:09:26,981
Thank you, Nate.

1848
02:09:27,001 --> 02:09:27,562
Appreciate it.

1849
02:09:28,393 --> 02:09:31,013
Okay, records.

1850
02:09:32,754 --> 02:09:38,615
The table records of the special meeting of September 25th, 2021 were passed to Councilor Falco.

1851
02:09:38,975 --> 02:09:41,195
Councilor Falco, how did you find those records?

1852
02:09:42,715 --> 02:09:47,436
On the motion by Councilor Falco for approval, seconded by Vice President Knight, Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1853
02:09:50,037 --> 02:09:50,597
Councilor Meares?

1854
02:09:50,917 --> 02:09:51,177
Yes.

1855
02:09:51,357 --> 02:09:52,277
Councilor Sanchez?

1856
02:09:52,717 --> 02:09:52,817
Yes.

1857
02:09:52,837 --> 02:09:53,697
Vice President Knight, yes.

1858
02:09:53,937 --> 02:09:54,497
Councilor Marx?

1859
02:09:54,697 --> 02:09:55,018
Yes.

1860
02:09:55,178 --> 02:09:55,798
Councilor Morrell?

1861
02:09:56,078 --> 02:09:56,258
Yes.

1862
02:09:59,693 --> 02:10:00,033
Yes.

1863
02:10:02,575 --> 02:10:05,077
Yes.

1864
02:10:05,097 --> 02:10:07,078
The records of the meeting of October 5th, 2021.

1865
02:10:07,138 --> 02:10:08,479
We'll pass it to Councilor Marks.

1866
02:10:08,919 --> 02:10:10,500
Councilor Marks, how did you find those records?

1867
02:10:11,241 --> 02:10:13,202
I find them to be in order to move approval, Mr. President.

1868
02:10:13,342 --> 02:10:16,464
On the motion by Councilor Marks, seconded by Councilor Baez.

1869
02:10:17,065 --> 02:10:18,145
Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

1870
02:10:22,828 --> 02:10:22,949
Aye.

1871
02:10:24,770 --> 02:10:24,950
Yes.

1872
02:10:27,015 --> 02:10:27,196
Yes.

1873
02:10:27,216 --> 02:10:27,296
Yes.
