00:00:04,998 --> 00:00:07,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to the 8th edition of the Mustang Report.

2
00:00:08,502 --> 00:00:10,924
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be showing you highlights of the boys' soccer game.

3
00:00:14,709 --> 00:00:16,491
[SPEAKER_06]: We will be visiting the Mustang Mall.

4
00:00:23,298 --> 00:00:26,021
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to be talking to Senor Scorker about his D.C.

5
00:00:26,081 --> 00:00:26,301
[SPEAKER_06]: trip.

6
00:00:38,347 --> 00:00:40,368
[SPEAKER_05]: make sure to come to The Hollow by Agatha Christie.

7
00:01:07,726 --> 00:01:09,088
Woo!

8
00:01:09,989 --> 00:01:10,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!

9
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:11,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!

10
00:01:11,851 --> 00:01:12,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah!

11
00:01:35,277 --> 00:01:36,619
[SPEAKER_04]: I got chills.

12
00:01:36,699 --> 00:01:41,826
[SPEAKER_04]: I got chills everywhere.

13
00:01:41,986 --> 00:01:43,909
It's Rozzy in her.

14
00:01:53,592 --> 00:02:00,438
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be here to recognize the great achievements Ashley has been involved in in her career here at the high school.

15
00:02:00,958 --> 00:02:04,301
[SPEAKER_00]: She's certainly been a leader that has pulled a lot of people together.

16
00:02:04,962 --> 00:02:18,394
[SPEAKER_00]: She has helped to blaze trails for kids who will come after and people who see what a great team that we've had for the last few years up here would want to get involved.

17
00:02:26,598 --> 00:02:28,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm Cheyenne Payne and I'm here with the Mustang Report.

18
00:02:29,359 --> 00:02:33,581
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm here in the main lobby here to interview Mr. Dennis Robinson.

19
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,902
[SPEAKER_04]: So, first question, what are your responsibilities here at MHS?

20
00:02:38,603 --> 00:02:44,085
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, my responsibility is basically security for the building, but I also act like its host.

21
00:02:44,745 --> 00:02:50,387
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a large building, people can get lost, so I'm able to give them directions as to where they need to go.

22
00:02:50,647 --> 00:02:52,068
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you like your job and why?

23
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,823
[SPEAKER_07]: I like my job because it's greeting people.

24
00:02:56,784 --> 00:03:05,267
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a person who likes to talk to people from different walks of life, different subjects, and I get to do that while I'm here.

25
00:03:05,547 --> 00:03:06,827
[SPEAKER_04]: What about your favorite sandwich?

26
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:13,930
[SPEAKER_07]: My favorite sandwich would be chicken salad or tuna salad, not peanut butter and jelly though.

27
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:17,231
[SPEAKER_07]: I eat it at home, but I just don't eat it in public because Mr.

28
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:25,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Dempsey and I have a controversy over peanut butter and jelly sandwich being a child fare but not the mature fare.

29
00:03:26,482 --> 00:03:31,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Katrina Rasche and I am here with Renee Stoudy, our faculty football expert.

30
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:38,325
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are going to be talking about the Eric Rezani faculty football game happening next Friday, November 20th at 6.30 p.m.

31
00:03:38,985 --> 00:03:43,766
[SPEAKER_06]: I will be saying some of the participants' names and Renee, you will be saying the first thing that comes to your head.

32
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:44,687
[SPEAKER_05]: So the truth.

33
00:03:44,947 --> 00:03:45,827
[SPEAKER_06]: The truth, yes, the truth.

34
00:03:46,362 --> 00:03:47,462
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Mr. Wilson.

35
00:03:47,883 --> 00:03:49,663
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, he used to be in the I.F.L.

36
00:03:49,844 --> 00:03:51,004
[SPEAKER_05]: and then he left the I.F.L.

37
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:53,405
[SPEAKER_05]: to play in our faculty football games here at M.H.S.

38
00:03:54,125 --> 00:03:54,846
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Rudowsky.

39
00:03:55,506 --> 00:03:57,267
[SPEAKER_05]: He was an amazing quarterback.

40
00:03:57,307 --> 00:04:03,789
[SPEAKER_05]: He played for the University of Alabama and he was offered the group at Packers, but no, we got him instead.

41
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:05,610
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Tucci.

42
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:08,311
[SPEAKER_05]: What would you do if you were up against Mr. Tucci?

43
00:04:09,012 --> 00:04:11,413
[SPEAKER_05]: If I was up against Mr. Tucci, I would probably run the other way.

44
00:04:11,433 --> 00:04:12,113
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, me too.

45
00:04:13,414 --> 00:04:14,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. Perrella.

46
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,512
[SPEAKER_05]: Dr. P, let's see, he was, he was a lot of things.

47
00:04:17,552 --> 00:04:23,677
[SPEAKER_05]: He played soccer, he coached football in college at University of Alabama also.

48
00:04:23,697 --> 00:04:25,659
[SPEAKER_05]: So he coached our players.

49
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:26,879
[SPEAKER_05]: Now he's playing with them.

50
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,364
[SPEAKER_06]: Dr. Perella has had a football trainer for the past few weeks and he's doing really well.

51
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:35,946
[SPEAKER_05]: By few weeks, you mean few months in this.

52
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:39,109
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Ms.

53
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:39,709
[SPEAKER_05]: Glasser?

54
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,270
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

55
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:42,051
[SPEAKER_05]: Glasser will watch out for that one.

56
00:04:42,652 --> 00:04:44,373
[SPEAKER_05]: This is gonna be a force to be reckoned with.

57
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:45,540
[SPEAKER_05]: How about Ms.

58
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:45,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Bowler?

59
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:46,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Ms.

60
00:04:46,461 --> 00:04:49,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Bowler, I heard she tackles students in the main office.

61
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,782
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where she gets her practice for tackling.

62
00:04:51,462 --> 00:04:54,364
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you guys most excited for about this faculty football game?

63
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:58,505
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have to say to see Mr. Drozdowski going down-ski.

64
00:04:59,506 --> 00:05:03,547
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm most excited about seeing Eric Ferrazani in the stands.

65
00:05:03,927 --> 00:05:11,190
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, cheering us on as a faculty, rooting us on, having a good time, and raising some money for awesome cars and an awesome family.

66
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:13,111
[SPEAKER_01]: And we very much look forward to seeing Eric.

67
00:05:13,638 --> 00:05:15,680
[SPEAKER_01]: and also compete against each other as a faculty.

68
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,682
[SPEAKER_05]: How into it all the teachers are going to get?

69
00:05:17,702 --> 00:05:19,663
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some pretty good rivalries going on.

70
00:05:20,044 --> 00:05:24,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I enjoy watching Mr. Drozdowski suffer.

71
00:05:25,308 --> 00:05:30,152
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he suffers in a very Shakespearean way.

72
00:05:30,753 --> 00:05:33,775
[SPEAKER_02]: It's dramatic, but it's also powerful.

73
00:05:34,116 --> 00:05:41,522
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can see the fear, the anger, the depression in his face, and for some reason that really

74
00:05:42,657 --> 00:05:44,558
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of interests me.

75
00:05:44,738 --> 00:05:49,001
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess I'm most interested in seeing how Drowski deals with another loss.

76
00:05:51,143 --> 00:05:51,883
[SPEAKER_06]: Breaking news!

77
00:05:53,484 --> 00:05:57,407
[SPEAKER_06]: It has just been informed to us that there is going to be a draft next Tuesday night.

78
00:05:57,427 --> 00:05:59,848
[SPEAKER_06]: So none of the teams are going to be the same.

79
00:06:00,949 --> 00:06:02,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Watch out Medford High.
