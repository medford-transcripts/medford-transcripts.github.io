1
00:00:28,578 --> 00:00:30,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, can you hear me?

2
00:00:30,819 --> 00:00:34,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just testing because I'm in a unique location.

3
00:00:47,048 --> 00:00:48,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Just testing, I can be heard.

4
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:57,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Testing, testing.

5
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:03,159
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me, guys?

6
00:01:06,402 --> 00:01:08,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Can anyone help me test if I can be heard?

7
00:01:09,124 --> 00:01:10,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt, are you there?

8
00:01:10,285 --> 00:01:10,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me?

9
00:01:10,765 --> 00:01:12,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, Matt?

10
00:01:13,287 --> 00:01:15,229
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see you in the council chambers.

11
00:01:15,629 --> 00:01:16,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me?

12
00:01:17,651 --> 00:01:18,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Test, test.

13
00:01:18,852 --> 00:01:20,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam, Matt, I can see you guys.

14
00:01:21,334 --> 00:01:22,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me when I talk?

15
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:30,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me, Adam?

16
00:01:32,563 --> 00:01:34,926
[SPEAKER_02]: You're muted, so I can't hear you, but I see your thumb.

17
00:01:35,566 --> 00:01:35,927
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

18
00:01:39,711 --> 00:01:41,212
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a thousand degrees in the room I'm in.

19
00:01:41,713 --> 00:01:42,854
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no air conditioning.

20
00:01:43,434 --> 00:01:49,621
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to not have to wear this jacket, but I know I have to wear a jacket.

21
00:01:50,982 --> 00:01:53,405
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't want to, but here we are.

22
00:19:35,229 --> 00:19:35,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Test.

23
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,598
[SPEAKER_12]: Testing.

24
00:20:08,206 --> 00:20:13,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Medford City Council Committee of the whole July 15 2025 is called to order Mr. Clerk, please call the roll.

25
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Present, six present, one absent.

26
00:20:35,471 --> 00:20:36,712
[SPEAKER_08]: The meeting is called to order.

27
00:20:36,792 --> 00:20:39,974
[SPEAKER_08]: There'll be a meeting of the Medford City Council, Committee of the Whole at 6 p.m.

28
00:20:40,014 --> 00:20:41,115
[SPEAKER_08]: in the City Council Chamber.

29
00:20:41,195 --> 00:20:45,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Second floor, Medford City Hall 85, George B. Hassett Drive, Medford M.A., and via Zoom.

30
00:20:46,659 --> 00:20:53,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Action and discussion items, 19-070, offered by Vice President Collins and Councilor Callahan, Tree Committee Ordinance.

31
00:20:54,184 --> 00:20:59,968
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a copy of the Tree Committee Ordinance before us tonight that has been reviewed by city staff and councilors and residents.

32
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:06,294
[SPEAKER_08]: involved in Trees Medford for our discussion and I will recognize Councilor Callaghan.

33
00:21:08,797 --> 00:21:09,178
[SPEAKER_08]: Should be good.

34
00:21:11,262 --> 00:21:11,562
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

35
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:24,815
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I just want to catch up my fellow Councilors as well as members of the public that at our last meeting, we sent this particular ordinance to have discussions with staff specifically, um.

36
00:21:25,595 --> 00:21:30,440
[SPEAKER_04]: With the DPW commissioner as well as our

37
00:21:35,564 --> 00:21:41,968
[SPEAKER_04]: the DPW commissioner had already sent me some edits to it and some concerns, things to change.

38
00:21:43,208 --> 00:21:46,670
[SPEAKER_04]: So we updated the wording with them.

39
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:50,572
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I also met with Trees Medford.

40
00:21:50,592 --> 00:21:53,773
[SPEAKER_04]: Trees Medford has been instrumental in creating this ordinance.

41
00:21:54,874 --> 00:21:57,355
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were also very happy with the changes that were made.

42
00:21:57,795 --> 00:22:02,518
[SPEAKER_04]: So today I'm hoping that this ordinance, which has been

43
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:11,541
[SPEAKER_04]: in committee a number of times can get sent to the City Council, but obviously we'll go through it one change at a time and see how the committee feels.

44
00:22:13,562 --> 00:22:13,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Great.

45
00:22:13,862 --> 00:22:15,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want to review the ordinance?

46
00:22:16,423 --> 00:22:16,543
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

47
00:22:19,747 --> 00:22:22,128
[SPEAKER_04]: The purpose of the ordinance, I'll just read it right out of here.

48
00:22:22,669 --> 00:22:32,935
[SPEAKER_04]: The Medford Tree Committee will promote a diverse, healthy and sustainable urban forest that will provide for the health, general welfare and quality of life of Medford citizens and the beauty and quality of the city's environment.

49
00:22:33,315 --> 00:22:39,339
[SPEAKER_04]: And really the purpose of this is just to have residents involved, to have a committee.

50
00:22:39,379 --> 00:22:43,421
[SPEAKER_04]: We have many commissions and committees and to have one that can specifically focus on trees.

51
00:22:44,082 --> 00:22:47,404
[SPEAKER_04]: So the changes that were made were

52
00:22:49,345 --> 00:22:51,947
[SPEAKER_04]: primarily to the duties.

53
00:22:53,127 --> 00:22:55,109
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can go over some of those changes.

54
00:22:55,169 --> 00:23:17,002
[SPEAKER_04]: There were a couple of items that we removed from the duties because Commissioner, DPW Commissioner McGivern mentioned that these are already duplicates of things that are being done by the DPW, their DPW jurisdiction and should not be given to a committee.

55
00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:19,063
[SPEAKER_04]: So we removed those.

56
00:23:20,043 --> 00:23:24,085
[SPEAKER_04]: We also changed some of the language.

57
00:23:24,565 --> 00:23:37,910
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, around the community forestry management plan, Commissioner McGivern again felt that this was a little bit more the jurisdiction of the DPW and the tree warden.

58
00:23:38,370 --> 00:23:43,432
[SPEAKER_04]: So rather than actively creating or working on that,

59
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:59,026
[SPEAKER_04]: We change it to reviewing the community forestry management plan provided by the DPW forest division, reviewing the administration's progress and implementing the plan, as well as reporting any concerns to city council.

60
00:23:59,366 --> 00:24:04,748
[SPEAKER_04]: So just sort of being available to make sure that these plans are being followed.

61
00:24:05,968 --> 00:24:07,149
[SPEAKER_04]: and to help if they can.

62
00:24:08,069 --> 00:24:26,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Similarly, with the annual report of tree planting and tree removal and maintenance, so this already is a report that is created, so rather than, you know, handing that to the tree committee, it's simply reviewing, requesting the annual report, reviewing it.

63
00:24:27,588 --> 00:24:30,369
[SPEAKER_04]: and much of it otherwise has remained the same.

64
00:24:30,389 --> 00:24:47,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe we did have a long discussion about the tree inventory and came to the conclusion that it would not actually be helpful for the tree committee to update the tree inventory because

65
00:24:48,293 --> 00:24:48,593
[SPEAKER_04]: reasons.

66
00:24:48,613 --> 00:24:51,614
[SPEAKER_04]: I could go into that long detail if people are interested, I'm happy to.

67
00:24:52,755 --> 00:25:08,521
[SPEAKER_04]: But basically, switched it again to reviewing the inventory, as well as the administration's sort of ability to maintain the inventory, just keeping a check that the inventory itself is being updated.

68
00:25:11,702 --> 00:25:16,324
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the very last point, which is labeled as A, but I believe that should be

69
00:25:18,318 --> 00:25:42,911
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at my copy, I'm not sure if I'm looking at the same copy, but the very last point of being available to assist the tree warden really rather than putting, sorry, to assist the tree warden in intended placement or replacement of trees, just switching the language a little bit so that they are available to help as needed rather than it being specifically in the hands of the tree committee.

70
00:25:43,131 --> 00:25:46,052
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you can see, most of it was taking a few things that,

71
00:25:47,133 --> 00:26:01,099
[SPEAKER_04]: that had been officially like the tree committee will do this and saying no, actually, those things are already done by the DPW and saying that now instead, the ordinance says that the tree committee will be available to help or will review.

72
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:02,740
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's most of the changes.

73
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:07,962
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to pause there and ask if there are any questions about the duties.

74
00:26:08,262 --> 00:26:10,883
[SPEAKER_04]: But after that, I'd like to go back to the appointment section.

75
00:26:12,984 --> 00:26:16,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Council have any questions on the duties of the tree committee?

76
00:26:19,808 --> 00:26:21,810
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Scarpelli.

77
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,272
[SPEAKER_11]: First, thank you, Councilor Kalani, for all your hard work.

78
00:26:24,352 --> 00:26:25,453
[SPEAKER_11]: I think this is important.

79
00:26:25,894 --> 00:26:38,425
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that, again, it keeps coming back and I don't see, is the, would this committee be in place for private trees in people's neighborhoods?

80
00:26:38,505 --> 00:26:40,246
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay, so that was a question I had from one resident.

81
00:26:40,707 --> 00:26:41,307
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it would not.

82
00:26:41,448 --> 00:26:42,969
[SPEAKER_04]: It could not cover private trees.

83
00:26:43,049 --> 00:26:44,070
[SPEAKER_04]: It is only the public trees.

84
00:26:44,458 --> 00:27:00,445
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we've seen, you know, with the limitations of forestry department, having a committee to assist, and especially Medford's so passionate about the tree canopy, I think it's important that this is a well-driven initiative.

85
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:01,006
[SPEAKER_11]: So thank you.

86
00:27:02,126 --> 00:27:02,406
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

87
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:03,807
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Scarpelli.

88
00:27:03,847 --> 00:27:07,349
[SPEAKER_08]: Any other questions from members of the council on the duties of the tree committee?

89
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:09,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Lazzaro.

90
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

91
00:27:13,221 --> 00:27:18,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to thank Councilor Callahan for bringing this forward and all of your work.

92
00:27:19,891 --> 00:27:26,923
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a really critical thing about this ordinance will be bringing attention to

93
00:27:27,904 --> 00:27:41,990
[SPEAKER_02]: the disparity in different parts of the city, the heat map areas where there are more trees and where we need to focus our attention and bring more trees.

94
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:47,573
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that a committee will be able to highlight that especially.

95
00:27:48,853 --> 00:27:56,177
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really excited about this moving forward and excited to see where it goes.

96
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:57,117
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks again.

97
00:27:59,077 --> 00:27:59,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

98
00:27:59,337 --> 00:28:08,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And just a quick reply, which is that letter F does specifically say promoting equity of tree planting across the city, including in neighborhoods identified as needing more trees.

99
00:28:08,902 --> 00:28:12,524
[SPEAKER_04]: So I feel that that's adequately covered in there.

100
00:28:12,624 --> 00:28:13,525
[SPEAKER_04]: And thank you for bringing that up.

101
00:28:16,066 --> 00:28:16,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Lazzaro.

102
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:17,967
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Callahan.

103
00:28:18,127 --> 00:28:23,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Any further questions on the duties of the tree committee before we continue with the rest of the ordinance?

104
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:28,311
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, Councilor Lohan.

105
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:29,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, sorry.

106
00:28:29,815 --> 00:28:31,058
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Leming got in under the wire.

107
00:28:31,118 --> 00:28:31,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Leming.

108
00:28:34,467 --> 00:28:45,858
[SPEAKER_10]: Just a question about the line saying that two youth members between the ages of 15 and 22 shall be at the time of their appointments.

109
00:28:45,878 --> 00:28:58,030
[SPEAKER_10]: Does the city currently have any mechanisms in place to reach out to high school students or college students in order to just make sure that those appointments get filled?

110
00:28:59,448 --> 00:28:59,688
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

111
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:04,212
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was actually just about to go to now review the appointments section.

112
00:29:04,412 --> 00:29:09,015
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was just the duties section, and I'd love to go over the appointments section, because that is one of the comments.

113
00:29:10,356 --> 00:29:16,241
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the appointments section, the staff did not ask for changes, but they did make some comments.

114
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:22,686
[SPEAKER_04]: And so if I can just go over those comments with you all, and folks can make any suggestions.

115
00:29:26,578 --> 00:29:30,542
[SPEAKER_04]: One is that, I apologize, what?

116
00:29:35,927 --> 00:29:37,388
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not, let's see.

117
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:44,214
[SPEAKER_04]: Do we wanna, I mean, let's see, I'm not looking at the same copy that you're looking at.

118
00:29:46,436 --> 00:29:49,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at a copy that I have, like the track changes.

119
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:50,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilwoman, could you share your screen?

120
00:29:54,991 --> 00:29:56,893
[SPEAKER_08]: do we work from the version that's in the agenda?

121
00:29:58,555 --> 00:29:58,975
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me see.

122
00:29:59,535 --> 00:30:02,398
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I need the copy that I've got some notes in, that's all, so.

123
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:10,386
[SPEAKER_08]: If Councilor Leming shared the copy that's in the agenda, would that be sufficient for us to look at, see on the screen?

124
00:30:10,446 --> 00:30:10,747
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

125
00:30:11,147 --> 00:30:13,870
[SPEAKER_08]: If Councilor Leming shared the copy that's in the agenda, would we be able to?

126
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,031
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

127
00:30:15,151 --> 00:30:18,274
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be helpful for the public and everything.

128
00:30:18,895 --> 00:30:19,175
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

129
00:30:38,096 --> 00:30:38,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

130
00:30:41,917 --> 00:30:49,998
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first comment, which was from Director Hunt was whether there was a process for removing people.

131
00:30:50,018 --> 00:31:06,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And she mentioned that for sort of advisory and educating committee like this one, it's good to allow it to be fairly large, but then you may want to have a process for removing people for non-participation because otherwise you sometimes can't meet quorum.

132
00:31:07,802 --> 00:31:14,973
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's one element, and I think I have some language that we could pull from the HRC ordinance, the Human Rights Commission ordinance about that.

133
00:31:14,993 --> 00:31:16,616
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's one.

134
00:31:19,047 --> 00:31:23,551
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the second one was specifically about the line that you were just mentioning, Councilor Leming.

135
00:31:24,252 --> 00:31:31,940
[SPEAKER_04]: It says in letter A, two youth members shall be between the ages of 15 and 22 at the time of their appointment.

136
00:31:33,121 --> 00:31:34,082
[SPEAKER_04]: We could leave that in.

137
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:39,527
[SPEAKER_04]: Therese Medford is also happy for that to become softer, either a suggestion or only one.

138
00:31:39,547 --> 00:31:42,070
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that's something for us to discuss.

139
00:31:48,413 --> 00:32:01,941
[SPEAKER_04]: In letter B, there originally was more stringent language, so we've already softened letter B, which says at least one member of the committee, it now says, will demonstrate expertise in the field of urban forestry and or landscape design.

140
00:32:01,961 --> 00:32:06,824
[SPEAKER_04]: And Medford residency is not required if this requisite expertise is demonstrated.

141
00:32:07,164 --> 00:32:12,126
[SPEAKER_04]: It previously said that they had professional experience, and so I think this is softened language.

142
00:32:17,948 --> 00:32:33,160
[SPEAKER_04]: And then my other comment, which I think I noticed very late today, is that we currently under letter C, the appointments are split among one year, two year, and three years for the first five people.

143
00:32:35,624 --> 00:32:45,508
[SPEAKER_04]: but it does not really adequately deal with if, for example, we appoint 10 people, like those other five people would then be appointed for terms of three years.

144
00:32:45,528 --> 00:32:51,691
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we would suddenly have like one person, two people, and then, you know, seven people all up at the same time.

145
00:32:52,071 --> 00:32:54,632
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe some language around that would be helpful.

146
00:32:57,593 --> 00:33:01,775
[SPEAKER_03]: So any comments on those specific questions that staff had?

147
00:33:14,902 --> 00:33:19,985
[SPEAKER_11]: I know that we'll probably get to it, but it just I think that part of the charter review.

148
00:33:20,025 --> 00:33:23,907
[SPEAKER_11]: We also mentioned that looking into having residents.

149
00:33:24,368 --> 00:33:24,888
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we have

150
00:33:25,677 --> 00:33:28,098
[SPEAKER_11]: multitude of residents that are passionate.

151
00:33:28,138 --> 00:33:33,679
[SPEAKER_11]: So I hope it would recommend that this would be method residents only as part of this commission.

152
00:33:33,719 --> 00:33:37,160
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, I champion this as well.

153
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,860
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate your input.

154
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:39,320
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

155
00:33:41,441 --> 00:33:42,921
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

156
00:33:46,122 --> 00:33:48,503
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I do want to

157
00:33:50,437 --> 00:34:11,570
[SPEAKER_10]: be able to have youth members on the committee, but I am thinking of just the situation where outreach is bad at a given year, so something to, if there's some way to adjust the language to make it so that that's strongly suggested, but wouldn't lead to two empty seats if youth did apply to it.

158
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,591
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that

159
00:34:15,506 --> 00:34:20,708
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, some way to adjust it so that that's not so strict would be useful.

160
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:36,156
[SPEAKER_10]: I do sympathize with my, with Councilor Scarpelli's comment about having Medford, only Medford residents on the committee.

161
00:34:37,222 --> 00:34:46,867
[SPEAKER_10]: But it may be that, but I also do want people who have a demonstrated expertise in urban forestry on the committee.

162
00:34:46,907 --> 00:34:55,450
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe there could be a situation some years where you may not have that in a smaller pool.

163
00:34:55,550 --> 00:35:04,995
[SPEAKER_10]: So if there's, there could be some language that says that if somebody is not,

164
00:35:06,375 --> 00:35:08,036
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, I think that's something I'm still thinking about.

165
00:35:08,116 --> 00:35:15,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe some language that says if somebody is not a Medford resident, they don't necessarily get voting power on the committee, but they could be there sort of in an advisory capacity.

166
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:20,960
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I do want expertise on the committee.

167
00:35:22,941 --> 00:35:27,102
[SPEAKER_10]: And I am concerned about limiting the pool for that.

168
00:35:27,162 --> 00:35:29,463
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, I do.

169
00:35:29,543 --> 00:35:31,964
[SPEAKER_10]: At the same time, I do understand where my colleague is coming from.

170
00:35:36,813 --> 00:35:37,593
[SPEAKER_08]: And Councilor Lamee.

171
00:35:39,374 --> 00:35:40,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan.

172
00:35:45,556 --> 00:35:46,356
[SPEAKER_07]: Councilor Callahan.

173
00:36:03,502 --> 00:36:04,803
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what's going on here today.

174
00:36:18,273 --> 00:36:18,894
[SPEAKER_08]: Here, try it now.

175
00:36:21,117 --> 00:36:21,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing.

176
00:36:27,465 --> 00:36:28,646
[SPEAKER_08]: Take Justin's for a second.

177
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:29,788
[SPEAKER_08]: There's something up with the mics.

178
00:36:49,636 --> 00:36:50,457
[SPEAKER_07]: This is so strange.

179
00:36:52,761 --> 00:36:53,342
[SPEAKER_07]: Blinking green.

180
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:08,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

181
00:37:10,282 --> 00:37:14,406
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am very happy for them to be Medford residents.

182
00:37:15,047 --> 00:37:23,374
[SPEAKER_04]: I would lean maybe toward just the one member with demonstrated expertise, the residency being not required.

183
00:37:24,615 --> 00:37:27,097
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd be interested in what other Councilors think of that.

184
00:37:27,838 --> 00:37:28,018
[SPEAKER_04]: And

185
00:37:32,246 --> 00:37:35,811
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think that we should have a removal process.

186
00:37:36,112 --> 00:37:39,437
[SPEAKER_04]: The one that's from the Human Rights Commission is quite simple.

187
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:45,145
[SPEAKER_04]: It just says they can be removed for cause by a majority of the commission.

188
00:37:47,790 --> 00:37:52,931
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's something that I would consider recommending after hearing from other Councilors.

189
00:37:54,932 --> 00:38:05,214
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would also love to, I don't know if this is a good time for public comment before making a motion or if you want to make all the changes in a motion before we take public comment.

190
00:38:07,255 --> 00:38:08,655
[SPEAKER_08]: What would your motion be?

191
00:38:09,907 --> 00:38:33,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I would make some very minor but specific recommendations, like the committee shall consist of between five and 10 Medford residents, rather than of five Medford residents and up to 10 members total, but leave the rest of it that says the demonstrated expertise, that one person, the Medford residency would not be required.

192
00:38:34,464 --> 00:38:36,405
[SPEAKER_04]: So I might make that suggestion and then

193
00:38:37,973 --> 00:38:46,478
[SPEAKER_04]: I would add an ability to remove if, you know, voted on by the whole commission.

194
00:38:47,038 --> 00:38:55,503
[SPEAKER_04]: So those are the kinds of things, the things that I've already mentioned are the things that I would maybe make some recommendations for, but it might be informed by public comments.

195
00:38:55,583 --> 00:38:57,944
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would be happy to take public comment first.

196
00:38:58,444 --> 00:39:00,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

197
00:39:01,526 --> 00:39:03,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Council Member, if you could stop sharing screen.

198
00:39:04,865 --> 00:39:15,914
[SPEAKER_08]: We have members of the public would like to comment on this draft ordinance either in person or on zoom income to the podium or raise your hand on zoom, we'll go to the podium, and then we'll go to zoom.

199
00:39:15,934 --> 00:39:19,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Name and address for the record.

200
00:39:19,678 --> 00:39:20,338
[SPEAKER_09]: Tom Lincoln 27.

201
00:39:22,429 --> 00:39:23,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Gleason Street.

202
00:39:23,470 --> 00:39:25,491
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd be happy to be the youth member, by the way.

203
00:39:26,952 --> 00:39:28,874
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I'm sorry, I'm a little behind on this.

204
00:39:29,154 --> 00:39:32,596
[SPEAKER_09]: This is one of two tree ordinances, if my memory serves.

205
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:33,477
[SPEAKER_09]: One of three.

206
00:39:34,138 --> 00:39:39,061
[SPEAKER_09]: This is just about the, sounds like an advisory committee, correct?

207
00:39:39,662 --> 00:39:44,605
[SPEAKER_09]: And the other two ordinances will be brought back here soon, yes?

208
00:39:47,027 --> 00:39:47,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, that's good.

209
00:39:50,462 --> 00:39:52,323
[SPEAKER_09]: I was curious about the tree inventory.

210
00:39:52,343 --> 00:39:56,964
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if this is germane to this particular, because I don't think I've ever seen one.

211
00:39:58,545 --> 00:40:07,207
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, I haven't seen statistics for plantings and cuttings in 2024, although I asked for this.

212
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:11,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there an updated tree inventory?

213
00:40:14,690 --> 00:40:15,370
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilor Callahan.

214
00:40:16,402 --> 00:40:17,902
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is a tree inventory.

215
00:40:18,042 --> 00:40:19,603
[SPEAKER_04]: It was done, I believe, last year.

216
00:40:20,883 --> 00:40:29,545
[SPEAKER_04]: And the administration is still, the DPW is still working on being able to keep the tree inventory completely updated.

217
00:40:29,925 --> 00:40:36,026
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're working through the process of having that be part of staff duties.

218
00:40:37,367 --> 00:40:43,788
[SPEAKER_09]: So statistics on things like stump removal is not part of the tree inventory, or is it?

219
00:40:46,362 --> 00:40:55,150
[SPEAKER_09]: So when when you say removal and well we had an inventory want to talk about inventory we had an inventory of hundreds and hundreds of stumps.

220
00:40:57,091 --> 00:41:04,738
[SPEAKER_09]: gracing our sidewalks and streets for a long time and there's been a lot of concern over the last.

221
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:09,941
[SPEAKER_09]: who knows how many years about this phenomenon.

222
00:41:10,661 --> 00:41:14,863
[SPEAKER_09]: And my understanding is that progress has been made.

223
00:41:14,883 --> 00:41:22,325
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, years ago, the DPW didn't even have a stump grinder, I don't believe, that progress has been made.

224
00:41:22,545 --> 00:41:26,427
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that reflected in the tree inventory or I get those statistics someplace else?

225
00:41:28,007 --> 00:41:28,788
[SPEAKER_08]: I am not sure.

226
00:41:28,808 --> 00:41:32,892
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, it's just one second.

227
00:41:34,413 --> 00:41:37,395
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan, we invited the DPW Commissioner.

228
00:41:38,276 --> 00:41:43,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know, I'm not seeing him on zoom do you know if he's going to join us at some point tonight or did he communicate with you.

229
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:44,141
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

230
00:41:44,181 --> 00:41:47,304
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, go back to Tom.

231
00:41:48,118 --> 00:41:51,302
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, again, more of a rhetorical question.

232
00:41:52,884 --> 00:42:03,577
[SPEAKER_09]: So it sounds to me that the confidence level in the DPW is pretty high on this in terms of the changes made, which I think is...

233
00:42:05,381 --> 00:42:06,483
[SPEAKER_09]: well, it is what it is.

234
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:21,743
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will look forward to the more substantive tree ordinances, and I've been working with some people at Trees Medford on some other ideas concerning the intersection of the trees

235
00:42:23,545 --> 00:42:36,411
[SPEAKER_09]: the tree issue and the zoning proposal, because I think, as a number of us do, that there really needs to be some interaction there and some teeth in the zoning on tree protection.

236
00:42:36,911 --> 00:42:38,972
[SPEAKER_09]: But that'll be for a future discussion.

237
00:42:39,072 --> 00:42:39,453
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

238
00:42:41,073 --> 00:42:41,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

239
00:42:41,474 --> 00:42:43,615
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go to Sarah on Zoom.

240
00:42:43,675 --> 00:42:45,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Sarah, name and address for the record, please.

241
00:42:45,556 --> 00:42:50,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you're going to need to unmute, Sarah.

242
00:42:55,142 --> 00:42:55,482
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

243
00:42:55,923 --> 00:42:56,843
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Sarah Gerald.

244
00:42:57,023 --> 00:42:58,905
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at 29 Burbank Road.

245
00:43:00,026 --> 00:43:01,727
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two comments.

246
00:43:02,587 --> 00:43:21,141
[SPEAKER_00]: One concerns the urban forest management plan, which is the development of which is underway and also the zoning and the public tree ordinance.

247
00:43:21,861 --> 00:43:29,785
[SPEAKER_00]: All of which might contribute ideas to this committee, the activities of this committee.

248
00:43:30,446 --> 00:43:38,530
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would like there to be some flexibility about being able to add those activities

249
00:43:39,087 --> 00:43:45,236
[SPEAKER_00]: or responsibilities to the tree committee if such a thing arises.

250
00:43:46,157 --> 00:43:50,583
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the second comment that I have concerns the student members.

251
00:43:53,912 --> 00:44:06,502
[SPEAKER_00]: It's possible that one of the student members will be in college at Tufts and might be a resident of Medford some years and not others.

252
00:44:07,163 --> 00:44:20,153
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's kind of would be if we have somebody who is doing a good job for us, we oughtn't, if they move to Somerville, tell them they can't be on this committee.

253
00:44:25,302 --> 00:44:25,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Sarah.

254
00:44:26,002 --> 00:44:30,203
[SPEAKER_08]: We have Jeremy, Jeremy Martin.

255
00:44:30,223 --> 00:44:33,524
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna ask you to unmute, name and address for the record, please.

256
00:44:37,325 --> 00:44:40,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi everyone, Jeremy Martin, 65 Burgett Ave.

257
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:47,027
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks to Councilor Callahan and others who have championed this Trees Medford group, especially.

258
00:44:48,067 --> 00:44:54,529
[SPEAKER_05]: Councilor Callahan, you've described in the past, and I've heard it presented multiple times that this is a,

259
00:44:55,478 --> 00:45:04,205
[SPEAKER_05]: both an advisory committee, but a way to hold the city accountable for our tree canopy, our urban canopy.

260
00:45:04,926 --> 00:45:17,816
[SPEAKER_05]: With the changes that have come out of the discussions with staff and with the DPW, do you feel that this ordinance as it's written still has the teeth to hold some accountability?

261
00:45:18,337 --> 00:45:23,781
[SPEAKER_05]: Have we lost some of that with kind of giving up the responsibilities and roles

262
00:45:25,407 --> 00:45:27,568
[SPEAKER_05]: that the DPDW already covers.

263
00:45:29,328 --> 00:45:41,832
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that we aren't losing some of our ability to really influence the way that the city approaches trees in public space by softening some of the language in the proposal.

264
00:45:41,852 --> 00:45:43,512
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it, thank you.

265
00:45:45,093 --> 00:45:45,573
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

266
00:45:45,593 --> 00:45:51,935
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anyone else who would like to comment at this time before I turn it back to Councilor Callahan?

267
00:45:53,591 --> 00:45:55,972
[SPEAKER_08]: seeing no hands on zoom and no one in the chamber.

268
00:45:56,032 --> 00:45:56,852
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Callahan.

269
00:45:58,933 --> 00:46:01,494
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate that final question, and I am going to answer it.

270
00:46:01,694 --> 00:46:15,820
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually, um, I feel quite strongly that the changes that were made were not changes that, um That lessened the impact of the tree committee.

271
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:16,861
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, um

272
00:46:18,523 --> 00:46:44,681
[SPEAKER_04]: In many cases, what happened was it became clear to me through long discussions with Commissioner McGibbon that in the case of the tree inventory, it actually was not possible for the tree committee to do that work because we talked in detail about exactly what that work would mean and who would be where at what moment in time when that needed to happen.

273
00:46:45,141 --> 00:46:47,583
[SPEAKER_04]: So for that specifically, I think

274
00:46:48,742 --> 00:46:50,585
[SPEAKER_04]: really it does need to be done by staff.

275
00:46:52,088 --> 00:46:57,938
[SPEAKER_04]: I think in the other circumstances, for example, the very last one, it really was just a question of

276
00:47:02,091 --> 00:47:13,262
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, these are things that that are being done and and it wasn't even the desire of the folks writing the tree committee ordinance to take it away from the tree warden.

277
00:47:13,282 --> 00:47:17,527
[SPEAKER_04]: It was simply kind of a little bit of a misunderstanding, but that this work is being done.

278
00:47:17,547 --> 00:47:21,851
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the intended placement and replacement of trees and what they wanted was to be available.

279
00:47:23,653 --> 00:47:26,915
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't feel that it is weakened.

280
00:47:27,816 --> 00:47:38,283
[SPEAKER_04]: I just feel that it fits more closely with, because I don't think those conversations, the deep conversations between the forestry department and the writers of this ordinance had happened yet.

281
00:47:38,623 --> 00:47:44,907
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's quite strong and I'm really excited for the tree committee to come into existence.

282
00:47:44,947 --> 00:47:47,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's gonna be a fantastic help.

283
00:47:47,389 --> 00:47:50,751
[SPEAKER_04]: The truth is we have an incredibly small forestry division.

284
00:47:51,712 --> 00:47:52,092
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's,

285
00:47:53,323 --> 00:47:57,304
[SPEAKER_04]: When we talk about accountability, it's really more like many hands make light work.

286
00:47:57,384 --> 00:48:04,326
[SPEAKER_04]: We need more people who can just kind of have their eyes on things and be available to do things, to show up at the hearings, to review things.

287
00:48:05,587 --> 00:48:08,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Our staff is very, very busy doing the work.

288
00:48:09,028 --> 00:48:17,391
[SPEAKER_04]: And so having some folks that can be there to sort of help with management and help with education efforts and all of that, I think is gonna be incredibly helpful.

289
00:48:17,551 --> 00:48:18,351
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was my first.

290
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:28,099
[SPEAKER_04]: My first one, I wonder if we could, I'm gonna make a couple of motions or I could make it in one motion.

291
00:48:30,781 --> 00:48:44,693
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to suggest that we change the last line of the last sentence in appointments letter A to say,

292
00:48:55,029 --> 00:49:01,452
[SPEAKER_04]: something like, if possible, two youth members shall be between the ages of 15 and 22 at the time of their appointment.

293
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:12,458
[SPEAKER_04]: And up for discussion, Medford residency not required for youth members.

294
00:49:15,459 --> 00:49:19,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, see what my fellow Councilors think of that before we put it in writing.

295
00:49:21,697 --> 00:49:28,781
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I would take a quote, I would add a bullet point about removal.

296
00:49:32,103 --> 00:49:46,532
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would say tree committee members may be removed only for cause by a two thirds vote of the commission, including for unexcused absence that exceed 25% of the number of meetings.

297
00:49:47,365 --> 00:49:48,866
[SPEAKER_04]: that the committee has held within a 12-month period.

298
00:49:49,046 --> 00:49:53,468
[SPEAKER_04]: That's directly out of the Human Rights Commission ordinance.

299
00:49:56,010 --> 00:50:04,074
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would add that line in case we have a large tree committee and they're not able to take votes because of absences.

300
00:50:05,835 --> 00:50:08,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Could you email the amended language to me and the clerk, please?

301
00:50:16,272 --> 00:50:17,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any further amendments?

302
00:50:23,379 --> 00:50:28,583
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we add something about, oh, yes.

303
00:50:29,484 --> 00:50:34,609
[SPEAKER_04]: My third one, and please let me know if people have any comments before I write them.

304
00:50:36,683 --> 00:50:37,943
[SPEAKER_04]: if you have any immediately.

305
00:50:39,324 --> 00:50:58,667
[SPEAKER_04]: But under C, it says upon formation of the Medford Treat Committee, two members will be appointed for a term of three years, two members will be appointed for a term of two years, and one member, what I would say is one third of the members shall be appointed for a term of three years, one third of the members shall be appointed for a term of two years, and the last third shall be appointed for a term of one year.

306
00:50:58,907 --> 00:51:05,388
[SPEAKER_04]: That way, if we appoint nine members or 12 members or however many, if we appoint more, then they're evenly distributed between the three years.

307
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:09,534
[SPEAKER_04]: I will email you those changes.

308
00:51:11,514 --> 00:51:36,866
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a motion to amend by Councilor Callahan to adjust the appointment section in the following ways to require Medford residency except for the possibility of two youth members and to appoint one third of initial members for three years, one third for two years and one third for one year.

309
00:51:40,188 --> 00:51:41,409
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have discussion on the motion?

310
00:51:41,729 --> 00:51:42,910
[SPEAKER_08]: And is there a second on the motion?

311
00:51:42,930 --> 00:51:47,553
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a second?

312
00:51:51,075 --> 00:51:53,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Leming seconds and has discussion.

313
00:51:53,176 --> 00:51:53,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Leming.

314
00:51:56,418 --> 00:52:09,006
[SPEAKER_10]: So instead of not requiring residency for the youth members, I think it might be better to add in a line about

315
00:52:10,248 --> 00:52:23,313
[SPEAKER_10]: basically if a member moves away and they have less than X number of months on their term, they're not automatically removed.

316
00:52:23,453 --> 00:52:30,176
[SPEAKER_10]: They can serve out the remainder of their term remotely if they so choose.

317
00:52:30,676 --> 00:52:33,857
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that kind of language would be a little bit more

318
00:52:35,541 --> 00:52:41,930
[SPEAKER_10]: would cover the situation that Sarah described just now a little bit better.

319
00:53:03,955 --> 00:53:04,755
[SPEAKER_06]: Councilor Tseng.

320
00:53:06,416 --> 00:53:18,180
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not necessarily opposed to Councilor Leming's idea because I think it does capture what Sarah mentioned, but I just worry the wording might be a little convoluted.

321
00:53:21,242 --> 00:53:34,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think Councilor Callaghan's proposal also kind of gets, I mean, it is slightly broader, but gets at a very similar idea without being so complex.

322
00:53:34,941 --> 00:53:38,125
[SPEAKER_06]: That's just my take, but I think either I'm okay with.

323
00:53:47,301 --> 00:53:56,293
[SPEAKER_10]: I personally just feel like not requiring residency for the youth members at all is a little bit, could be a little bit odd.

324
00:54:03,327 --> 00:54:04,008
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh, president bears.

325
00:54:04,028 --> 00:54:10,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Can I answer saying, um, yeah, I mean, I, I definitely see that.

326
00:54:10,133 --> 00:54:12,415
[SPEAKER_06]: I do think that cases would be pretty rare.

327
00:54:13,235 --> 00:54:16,458
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, maybe the phrasing should be like.

328
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:21,262
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford residency and those enrolled in Medford.

329
00:54:22,063 --> 00:54:26,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, educational institutions, something like that, like that would capture tops.

330
00:54:27,947 --> 00:54:30,269
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the question is what if.

331
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:34,382
[SPEAKER_06]: well, no, nevermind, they would be Medford residents.

332
00:54:35,443 --> 00:54:36,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Ignore that very last part.

333
00:54:40,608 --> 00:54:41,108
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Leming.

334
00:54:41,649 --> 00:54:55,300
[SPEAKER_10]: I would be fine saying Medford, like youth, the youth may be Medford residents or enrolled attendees of educational institutions based in Medford.

335
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,462
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that would capture the spirit of it.

336
00:55:08,418 --> 00:55:14,021
[SPEAKER_08]: either Councilor Callahan or Councilor Leming, I think it'd be helpful if we could read an amended version of section A.

337
00:55:16,263 --> 00:55:17,924
[SPEAKER_08]: 2A, Councilor Callahan.

338
00:55:20,345 --> 00:55:22,006
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm about to send this email.

339
00:55:22,326 --> 00:55:26,729
[SPEAKER_04]: What I have is the committee A, the committee shall consist of between five and 10 Medford residents.

340
00:55:26,789 --> 00:55:27,449
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a change.

341
00:55:28,329 --> 00:55:32,512
[SPEAKER_04]: And then before the last sentence, if possible, two youth members.

342
00:55:33,575 --> 00:55:34,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you just read the full?

343
00:55:35,096 --> 00:55:35,396
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, sure.

344
00:55:35,536 --> 00:55:35,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

345
00:55:36,137 --> 00:55:38,819
[SPEAKER_04]: The committee shall consist of between 5 and 10 Medford residents.

346
00:55:39,639 --> 00:55:45,023
[SPEAKER_04]: One appointment made by City Council and all additional appointments made by the Mayor subject to confirmation by the Medford City Council.

347
00:55:46,263 --> 00:55:51,187
[SPEAKER_04]: If possible, two youth members shall be between the ages of 15 and 22 at the time of their appointment.

348
00:55:53,068 --> 00:55:59,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have language for the youth members being in an institution that is?

349
00:56:01,314 --> 00:56:01,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Councilor Leming?

350
00:56:08,377 --> 00:56:28,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see, maybe at the last sentence of 2A, the youth members, maybe just residency is not required for the youth members as long as they are enrolled in educational institutions based in Medford.

351
00:56:40,245 --> 00:56:45,550
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

352
00:56:49,954 --> 00:56:51,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I am sending it now.

353
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:24,726
[SPEAKER_08]: So section 2A would read, the committee shall consist of between 5 and 10 Medford residents, one appointment made by City Council and all additional appointments made by the Mayor subject to confirmation by the Medford City Council.

354
00:57:25,466 --> 00:57:30,089
[SPEAKER_08]: If possible, two youth members shall be between the ages of 15 and 22 at the time of their appointment.

355
00:57:30,649 --> 00:57:35,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Residency is not required for youth members as long as they are enrolled at an educational institution based in Medford.

356
00:57:37,170 --> 00:58:05,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Section C would be updated to, 2C would read, upon formation of the member tree committee, one third of members shall be appointed for a term of three years, one third of members shall be appointed for a term of two years, and one third of the members shall be appointed for a term of one year, and then would add a section 2D that reads, tree committee members may be removed only for cause by a two-thirds vote of the committee, including for unexcused absences that exceed 25% of the number of meetings of the committee held within a 12-month period.

357
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:11,282
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's a motion to amend by Councilor Callahan, seconded by Councilor Leming.

358
00:58:11,322 --> 00:58:13,343
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there any further discussion on the amendment?

359
00:58:19,727 --> 00:58:20,827
[SPEAKER_08]: By members of the Council?

360
00:58:23,189 --> 00:58:28,672
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing none, is there any further discussion by members of the public on the amendment or the ordinance proposal?

361
00:58:33,357 --> 00:58:35,839
[SPEAKER_08]: Seeing no one in the chamber and no hands on zoom.

362
00:58:36,459 --> 00:58:39,741
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll take a vote on the amendment, Mr. Clerk when you're ready, please call the roll.

363
00:58:53,049 --> 00:58:53,710
[SPEAKER_12]: Council Callahan.

364
00:58:53,850 --> 00:58:54,030
