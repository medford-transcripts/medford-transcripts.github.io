1
00:00:04,543 --> 00:00:08,285
[SPEAKER_00]: The following interview is with incumbent mayor Breanna Lungo-Koehn.

2
00:00:09,085 --> 00:00:17,530
[SPEAKER_00]: Information for the intro was taken from Brianna's campaign website, as well as the City of Medford website, which are both linked in the show notes for further reading.

3
00:00:18,836 --> 00:00:28,102
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2001, Brianna decided to run for city council and won a seat at the age of 21, at that time serving as the youngest city councilor in Medford's history.

4
00:00:28,822 --> 00:00:35,086
[SPEAKER_00]: With a bachelor's in criminal justice and psychology, Brianna went on to get a law degree and open her own law practice in 2009.

5
00:00:36,943 --> 00:00:44,956
[SPEAKER_00]: During her time as a city councillor, among many other accomplishments, Brianna helped start the first high school girls hockey team in Medford's history.

6
00:00:45,778 --> 00:00:51,246
[SPEAKER_00]: She also fought for important community programs focused on uplifting underserved children and families.

7
00:00:52,373 --> 00:01:00,538
[SPEAKER_00]: After serving nine terms on city council, Brianna was elected mayor and sworn into the office as the 32nd mayor of Medford on January 5th, 2020.

8
00:01:01,818 --> 00:01:18,428
[SPEAKER_00]: During the past 18 months, Brianna has led the city through the COVID-19 pandemic while continuing to plan new ways for the city and school system to grow and change through the launching of a new comprehensive plan, upgrading and renovating more than 30 parks and open spaces, and creating a social justice roadmap.

9
00:01:19,637 --> 00:01:22,458
[SPEAKER_00]: Brianna is now running for her second term as mayor.

10
00:01:22,478 --> 00:01:32,203
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Brianna, thanks so much for joining me today.

11
00:01:33,023 --> 00:01:40,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Before we start out talking about your campaign, I've been asking everybody kind of their favorite place to eat in the city and what they like to order there.

12
00:01:41,645 --> 00:01:43,126
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to answer a few things.

13
00:01:43,246 --> 00:01:46,428
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for breakfast, I love to go to Magnificent Muffin.

14
00:01:46,468 --> 00:01:51,411
[SPEAKER_01]: They have gluten-free, dairy-free bacon, egg, and cheese sandwiches that are my favorite.

15
00:01:51,471 --> 00:01:55,493
[SPEAKER_01]: So somebody in our office will always pick it up once a week for the staff.

16
00:01:56,533 --> 00:02:02,757
[SPEAKER_01]: I love a good haddock marinara from Bichelli's or bucka chuck from Carroll's.

17
00:02:02,877 --> 00:02:04,198
[SPEAKER_01]: They also have a great lobster roll.

18
00:02:04,298 --> 00:02:08,560
[SPEAKER_01]: So those just to name three, but there's just so many great places to eat in Medford.

19
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:09,100
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice.

20
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:11,683
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good to know about the dairy-free Magnificent Muffin.

21
00:02:11,723 --> 00:02:12,543
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always looking for that.

22
00:02:12,724 --> 00:02:14,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, dairy-free butter.

23
00:02:14,265 --> 00:02:16,307
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's delicious.

24
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:16,627
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

25
00:02:16,727 --> 00:02:18,169
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for that.

26
00:02:18,749 --> 00:02:21,211
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I know you've been really busy, it sounds like.

27
00:02:21,251 --> 00:02:25,115
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how all of you guys get to all the different things, the events for your campaigns.

28
00:02:26,456 --> 00:02:35,508
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm just kind of curious to hear what's leading you to run again for mayor, but also just sort of your path to how you arrived at local politics.

29
00:02:35,628 --> 00:02:38,452
[SPEAKER_00]: In the intro, we talked about you were very young when you started out.

30
00:02:38,492 --> 00:02:41,576
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm always interested to hear about your motivations there.

31
00:02:42,317 --> 00:02:50,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was 20 and in college at Endicott studying when I decided to run for city council.

32
00:02:50,562 --> 00:02:57,866
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just something I brought up to my father and mother because he was a local business owner.

33
00:02:57,926 --> 00:02:58,786
[SPEAKER_01]: He knew the players.

34
00:02:58,826 --> 00:03:00,067
[SPEAKER_01]: It would always be on TV.

35
00:03:00,167 --> 00:03:08,111
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, you know, over time noticed that it was really no younger representation and barely any female representation.

36
00:03:09,492 --> 00:03:12,073
[SPEAKER_01]: At a crazy young age, I decided that I was going to take a shot.

37
00:03:12,213 --> 00:03:15,814
[SPEAKER_01]: And once we did, it was early on in this campaign season.

38
00:03:15,874 --> 00:03:18,835
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just worked really, really hard going door to door.

39
00:03:20,855 --> 00:03:24,917
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably gave out about over 60,000 brochures to get elected that first time.

40
00:03:24,977 --> 00:03:27,897
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily, it happened.

41
00:03:27,977 --> 00:03:29,658
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just continually kept getting

42
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:36,759
[SPEAKER_01]: more involved in different issues and kept saying, I think this might be my last term, but then I would just get more and more involved.

43
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:45,121
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially when I had kids, I wanted to be part of, you know, city government to know what was going on within our city and in our school system.

44
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:48,762
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what led me to run for mayor.

45
00:03:48,902 --> 00:03:50,022
[SPEAKER_01]: I never expected it.

46
00:03:50,222 --> 00:03:52,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if people would ask when I was younger, I would say,

47
00:03:53,343 --> 00:03:59,246
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not my plan, but if the city, I feel the city needs me, then I would do it.

48
00:03:59,266 --> 00:04:10,713
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think probably three of the biggest issues at the time were, first and foremost, everything that happened at the school, at the McGlynn School with the loaded gun magazine.

49
00:04:10,773 --> 00:04:13,034
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was thrown away and then covered up.

50
00:04:13,114 --> 00:04:15,755
[SPEAKER_01]: And I kind of was the one that people came to and trusted.

51
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:18,517
[SPEAKER_01]: And to this day, I've kept those people confidential.

52
00:04:18,597 --> 00:04:21,819
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the end, we were able to change the administration.

53
00:04:22,799 --> 00:04:30,687
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a wonderful principal there now who's doing a great job, and ironically my daughter went there the year after.

54
00:04:32,109 --> 00:04:37,734
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, development within the community, it was just kind of always who you know, and certain players would be able to

55
00:04:39,015 --> 00:04:53,808
[SPEAKER_01]: come into Medford and develop sometimes almost whatever they wanted to the point where our Zoning Board of Appeals would shut the door on residents and at one time voted for a 500-unit project behind closed doors and then the board, most of the board ended up resigning.

56
00:04:53,828 --> 00:04:58,151
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was, you know, got pretty involved in the development aspect and then

57
00:04:59,318 --> 00:05:18,896
[SPEAKER_01]: we have a lot of city maintenance issues that need to be tackled and at the time there was a lot of our fire station needs and the fact that I was really pushing for a combined police and fire station and it just didn't happen and a number of things were going on so over the holidays people were

58
00:05:19,757 --> 00:05:31,406
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing in the fall, so then over the holidays that year, my husband and I really discussed it in depth because we had three young children and it turned into, can we really, should we do this?

59
00:05:31,626 --> 00:05:32,427
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we do this?

60
00:05:32,507 --> 00:05:33,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it right for our kids?

61
00:05:34,929 --> 00:05:38,471
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the week or two, it turned into, we need to do this for our kids.

62
00:05:38,712 --> 00:05:42,534
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's ultimately, especially the situation at the schools.

63
00:05:43,995 --> 00:05:48,596
[SPEAKER_01]: is what kind of pushed me to run for mayor and I did it for the right reasons.

64
00:05:48,676 --> 00:06:01,039
[SPEAKER_01]: I did it for not only the kids and the students and the teachers but for families and just to try to make Medford a better place all around and do the right thing always.

65
00:06:01,359 --> 00:06:04,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody should be afforded all the opportunities and that goes from

66
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:22,764
[SPEAKER_01]: age, you know, infants to big-time developers, you know, everybody should have the same opportunities, things should be done fairly, to the book, legally, and I just, that's kind of what my focus is, you know, that and making sure I always listen and act and respond.

67
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:34,747
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's kind of what people have appreciated over the last, especially the last 20 months, just being responsive, being more transparent and communicating as much as we can out to the public as possible.

68
00:06:35,172 --> 00:06:54,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know and I appreciate that sort of, I've been hearing a lot about change and like people's like thoughts about change and change being kind of, it can be slow and incremental and one of the things that I talk about in the intro for you is the girls hockey team at the high school and thinking about how like what we do today is like really going to impact our kids, you know, like our the future generations.

69
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:55,088
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

70
00:06:55,168 --> 00:06:55,469
[SPEAKER_00]: And so

71
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:58,632
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny, my mom actually, I played lacrosse in high school and college.

72
00:06:58,652 --> 00:07:00,734
[SPEAKER_00]: My mom had started the team at my high school.

73
00:07:00,754 --> 00:07:07,421
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, I really like that forward thinking about what we want for the future is like something I've been thinking about a lot in these interviews.

74
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:12,907
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wonder sort of in a second term what your sort of like top priorities would be for continued change.

75
00:07:13,748 --> 00:07:28,903
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and just to touch on the hockey program, I worked with a number of families that had young girls that wanted to play hockey and have the same rights as boys did playing hockey for our high school.

76
00:07:29,704 --> 00:07:31,586
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was before I even had kids.

77
00:07:31,746 --> 00:07:34,068
[SPEAKER_01]: That was before I even knew my husband.

78
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:40,394
[SPEAKER_01]: And ironically, now my daughter, who's in fifth grade, is on two hockey teams, Medford and the Americans.

79
00:07:40,454 --> 00:07:43,016
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hoping one day she'll play for the high school.

80
00:07:43,477 --> 00:07:44,778
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have great news.

81
00:07:44,818 --> 00:07:47,821
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't even know if it's been shared yet, but we have

82
00:07:49,702 --> 00:07:50,002
[SPEAKER_01]: U.S.

83
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:54,863
[SPEAKER_01]: star who's from Medford, Brittany Lanzilli, who just got the coaching job at the high school.

84
00:07:54,943 --> 00:07:57,484
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a new coach there who's going to be doing great things.

85
00:07:58,264 --> 00:08:03,506
[SPEAKER_01]: We're thankful for all the past coaching that has gone on at the high school, but pretty exciting times right now.

86
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:10,988
[SPEAKER_01]: So your question with regards to the plans and why I'm running for a second term, I

87
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:17,136
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the most challenging, toughest part of the last 21 months has been COVID.

88
00:08:17,256 --> 00:08:23,040
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've spent a lot of time on COVID, making sure, again, that we communicate and are transparent.

89
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:33,468
[SPEAKER_01]: And my job turned into making sure people were healthy and safe and sane, in a way, because mental health is such an issue, especially now.

90
00:08:33,588 --> 00:08:39,753
[SPEAKER_01]: So through it all, with the help of the Board of Health and the superintendent and the school admin,

91
00:08:41,512 --> 00:08:47,414
[SPEAKER_01]: all we've done to make sure testing, we've been testing our students and got them back safely, as well as our admin.

92
00:08:48,714 --> 00:08:50,774
[SPEAKER_01]: We on the city side have done a lot of planning.

93
00:08:51,555 --> 00:09:00,377
[SPEAKER_01]: The first year, especially 2020, we took to plan and we've started to implement those plans, but there is just still so much more to do.

94
00:09:00,537 --> 00:09:04,718
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the focusing we did was on our parks.

95
00:09:04,838 --> 00:09:07,939
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 38 park projects that we're working on.

96
00:09:08,379 --> 00:09:11,180
[SPEAKER_01]: Just did a grand opening for the five tennis courts at

97
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,341
[SPEAKER_01]: Duggar Park.

98
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:17,744
[SPEAKER_01]: Today was supposed to be Barry and Playstead, but we had to cancel because of the weather.

99
00:09:17,784 --> 00:09:19,765
[SPEAKER_01]: We did new basketball courts there.

100
00:09:19,965 --> 00:09:24,148
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the, this is your neck of the woods, we have the car park design that we're working on.

101
00:09:25,117 --> 00:09:29,900
[SPEAKER_01]: We implemented handicap accessible tables at our pond and pool.

102
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:37,884
[SPEAKER_01]: So things from handicap accessible tables and chairs all the way up to the car park redesign is kind of what we're working on.

103
00:09:37,904 --> 00:09:40,186
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've already started planning for phase two.

104
00:09:40,766 --> 00:09:50,232
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've put in, I think, about eight applications to CPA, which will be just improvements you'll see over the next year, year and a half.

105
00:09:50,952 --> 00:09:52,633
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done a tremendous amount of work

106
00:09:52,953 --> 00:10:08,556
[SPEAKER_01]: and planning and implementation for our fire stations, new roofs in some locations, new kitchens, new windows, new bay doors, apparatus flooring has been redone, and we also just this week picked our

107
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:19,110
[SPEAKER_01]: design consultant, our OPM for a potential new fire headquarters, which is exciting and it's just something I want to see get done.

108
00:10:19,991 --> 00:10:25,294
[SPEAKER_01]: We also took a year to assess our streets and sidewalks and that was released, that plan

109
00:10:26,828 --> 00:10:40,418
[SPEAKER_01]: was released over the summer, so we are actively trying to crack seal the 95 streets that need to get crack sealed so they don't fall into disrepair where you need millions of dollars to fix one street.

110
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:42,920
[SPEAKER_01]: And through that, we've learned we have

111
00:10:44,075 --> 00:10:46,917
[SPEAKER_01]: $175 million worth of work to do on our streets alone.

112
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:50,120
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't even include the water and sewers and sidewalks.

113
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,082
[SPEAKER_01]: We have over $30 million worth of work to do on our sidewalks.

114
00:10:54,182 --> 00:10:59,786
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to be on the forefront in trying to plan and get that done.

115
00:11:01,047 --> 00:11:06,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Thankfully, we have some of the ARPA money that we'll be able to use on water and sewer and street infrastructure.

116
00:11:07,729 --> 00:11:10,190
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's just so much more to do.

117
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:16,492
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also did our first ever comprehensive six-year capital improvement plan that we've already started.

118
00:11:17,332 --> 00:11:17,912
[SPEAKER_01]: implementing.

119
00:11:18,192 --> 00:11:19,453
[SPEAKER_01]: We have another five years to go.

120
00:11:19,473 --> 00:11:22,393
[SPEAKER_01]: We've worked on a comprehensive master plan.

121
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:26,314
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about at least a quarter ways through that and that's going to help.

122
00:11:27,194 --> 00:11:45,558
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a community-driven process where we want community input to create a vision for Medford for ten, thirty years down the road so that we know what people want, where they want it, and what to tell developers and how to reimagine our city that will benefit everybody from

123
00:11:46,796 --> 00:11:48,618
[SPEAKER_01]: vitality to inclusiveness.

124
00:11:49,198 --> 00:11:51,620
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to work on that to get it done.

125
00:11:51,721 --> 00:12:01,890
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were able to start with our new Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability, which was a merge that we decided to do early on.

126
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:10,576
[SPEAKER_01]: in the term with Energy and Environment and the Office of Community Development so that there's an environmental lens on everything we do.

127
00:12:10,756 --> 00:12:15,139
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's worked and it's going great.

128
00:12:15,159 --> 00:12:20,963
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could probably keep going, but we also, for the first time,

129
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:27,989
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2020 when I was, after I was inaugurated, one of the first things we did was create a human resource department.

130
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:42,321
[SPEAKER_01]: So Medford had never had human resources and that's something that a city of our size needs so badly and we were able to start that from scratch, implement policies and procedures and we have a lot more to do.

131
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,283
[SPEAKER_01]: You know there's some, I always say there's

132
00:12:45,383 --> 00:13:02,434
[SPEAKER_01]: 95 to 99 percent of amazing employees out there, but there's some people we need to hold accountable in order to get things done, and we're doing that work, and we have more we want to accomplish and more we want to do to make sure everybody's just working hard and getting things done for our community.

133
00:13:02,935 --> 00:13:05,556
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned community input in some of this planning.

134
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,638
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best way for the community to give input?

135
00:13:10,205 --> 00:13:26,606
[SPEAKER_01]: We always are checking our emails, but for example, the Comprehensive Master Plan, we made sure that we not only are doing surveys that we love people to fill out, we have an interactive map on the website where you can go to a certain area and plug in your thoughts.

136
00:13:27,707 --> 00:13:33,570
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the number one thing people seem to love, just that interactive map.

137
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:39,674
[SPEAKER_01]: We also are trying to get community booths at the Oktoberfest and any type of events we do.

138
00:13:39,734 --> 00:13:43,676
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been car park tables so that people can give their input.

139
00:13:43,716 --> 00:13:46,898
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been the comprehensive plan that we're really trying to push out.

140
00:13:46,978 --> 00:13:56,844
[SPEAKER_01]: So contacting anybody on our staff, going on our website medfordmass.org, there's always ways, always surveys that can be filled out, always ways to get involved.

141
00:13:57,664 --> 00:14:04,630
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got even the composting that we brought in a composting program to Medford to make it affordable for our residents.

142
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:15,158
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was like something like 900 people filled out a survey, which is we're getting like 900 to 1,000 people filling out different surveys, including our parking.

143
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:19,882
[SPEAKER_01]: We're bringing parking enforcement in-house, which everybody's excited about, and that input.

144
00:14:23,011 --> 00:14:33,161
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it be the community meetings or surveys, just highly, many people were involved.

145
00:14:33,181 --> 00:14:34,542
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want to just continue that.

146
00:14:34,702 --> 00:14:38,986
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have many more community meetings planned for a number of different things we're working on.

147
00:14:40,469 --> 00:14:46,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeing that all get followed through is something I'm really excited about and I want to be part of.

148
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:52,537
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to just continue to hire the right people to do the right jobs based on experience.

149
00:14:52,757 --> 00:14:55,519
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the way you can move a community forward.

150
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:59,282
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see that as being a difference that I'm trying to make.

151
00:14:59,662 --> 00:15:06,146
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like a lot of changes you've put in motion that you hope to continue to work towards the end result that you're hoping for there.

152
00:15:07,127 --> 00:15:08,768
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's still so much more to do.

153
00:15:08,848 --> 00:15:19,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this morning I was reviewing public art that we're going to put out at La Conte Rink, just like we did at the pool.

154
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:23,394
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm excited to continue the hard work.

155
00:15:23,994 --> 00:15:25,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day there's something new.

156
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:31,037
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always like four or five or six different emergencies that need to be tended to or fires to put out.

157
00:15:31,117 --> 00:15:32,598
[SPEAKER_01]: But I love the job.

158
00:15:32,718 --> 00:15:33,858
[SPEAKER_01]: I love helping people.

159
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:36,980
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to solve problems.

160
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:43,306
[SPEAKER_01]: I love even just being responsive and it seems that people appreciate that even if you're not giving them the exact answer they want to hear.

161
00:15:44,047 --> 00:15:54,056
[SPEAKER_01]: People are just happy that there's somebody in the mayor's office that's being responsive and that, as my whole staff will tell you, just community

162
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,943
[SPEAKER_01]: responsiveness and customer service are just top priority.

163
00:16:01,383 --> 00:16:02,604
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely been my experience.

164
00:16:02,644 --> 00:16:10,851
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like, you know, I haven't lived in Medford my whole life, but I feel like when I think about city government and, like, politics, it all feels very inaccessible to me.

165
00:16:10,911 --> 00:16:15,935
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's been, like, really cool to see, like, you've been very responsive, like, in reaching out to email.

166
00:16:16,015 --> 00:16:21,719
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the other city Councilors and school committee members have been, like, really accessible, which I feel like is really great.

167
00:16:21,779 --> 00:16:25,202
[SPEAKER_00]: And, like, I don't know that that's all cities' experiences with city government, so.

168
00:16:25,562 --> 00:16:26,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm glad.

169
00:16:26,163 --> 00:16:26,804
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to hear it.

170
00:16:26,864 --> 00:16:31,088
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's some great people in politics here and great people working for us.

171
00:16:31,108 --> 00:16:36,053
[SPEAKER_01]: They work really hard and go above and beyond what you could ask for.

172
00:16:36,814 --> 00:16:43,641
[SPEAKER_00]: And you mentioned the public health or the health department earlier and I had heard about a program that was implemented during COVID.

173
00:16:43,661 --> 00:16:44,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you okay?

174
00:16:44,662 --> 00:16:45,343
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that what it's called?

175
00:16:46,077 --> 00:16:53,403
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, actually, that's a funny story that came out of a mutual friend of ours, Sara.

176
00:16:54,324 --> 00:16:58,327
[SPEAKER_01]: Sara and I were talking right when the pandemic hit, and she was part-time.

177
00:16:59,448 --> 00:17:02,751
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, Sara, we need to make sure that our seniors are okay.

178
00:17:03,151 --> 00:17:04,673
[SPEAKER_01]: She's like, I know, we do, we do.

179
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:04,913
[SPEAKER_01]: I said,

180
00:17:05,333 --> 00:17:10,516
[SPEAKER_01]: we should create, you know, we should get volunteers to call and make sure all our seniors are okay.

181
00:17:10,556 --> 00:17:13,317
[SPEAKER_01]: And she's like, yeah, yeah, we should do that.

182
00:17:13,357 --> 00:17:26,865
[SPEAKER_01]: So then, you know, it got brought to the Board of Health and the Prevention and Outreach Office and between Sara and Brooke and Penny and Marianne and myself and then the hundreds of volunteers we were able to assemble, we called over

183
00:17:29,008 --> 00:17:50,413
[SPEAKER_01]: 11,500 seniors ages 65 and over, many of whom needed food to be delivered, many needed medication to be delivered, and also some that just needed mental health help because of the isolation, and some that just would ask the volunteers to give them a call once a month or once a week, and they did.

184
00:17:50,473 --> 00:17:51,253
[SPEAKER_01]: These volunteers

185
00:17:51,753 --> 00:17:59,838
[SPEAKER_01]: went above and beyond, some calling 50 to 100 people, some calling hundreds of our seniors to just check in, and I think that that went a long way.

186
00:17:59,858 --> 00:18:11,384
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I feel like the term that we were using was social distancing in the beginning of COVID, like that really like that to me is a social connection, right, a real opportunity to build community, and I feel like that's

187
00:18:12,945 --> 00:18:39,119
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I think I took away from being the pandemic like the community kind of felt like it came together in a way and that I think it didn't have to go that way but it did and like so I don't know I try to think about like physical distancing versus social distancing and that that feels like a real like I have a friend in the health department Alicia Gambia oh yes Alicia yeah and she was like you know telling me about the program and like it seemed like a creative solution to maybe some of the work that was less successful because of COVID but to really create that opportunity

188
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:39,799
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really cool.

189
00:18:39,839 --> 00:18:42,080
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like we don't, we haven't heard enough about that program.

190
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:46,041
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I know people, people who, even people who volunteer just, just loved it.

191
00:18:46,101 --> 00:18:49,063
[SPEAKER_01]: We were able to get, like I said, hundreds of volunteers through that.

192
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:52,984
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we also increased our emergency medical response team.

193
00:18:53,524 --> 00:18:55,705
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, even my husband and I just signed up to,

194
00:18:56,245 --> 00:18:59,107
[SPEAKER_01]: and we'll get emails when volunteers are needed.

195
00:18:59,828 --> 00:19:01,529
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it went a long way.

196
00:19:01,569 --> 00:19:12,818
[SPEAKER_01]: And between that and the robocalls that I made sure I did once or twice, you know, once a week or every other week just to keep people informed, I feel like that's what I hear most from our seniors.

197
00:19:12,838 --> 00:19:14,499
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just so happy to have been.

198
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:18,042
[SPEAKER_01]: They felt good knowing the city cared about them.

199
00:19:18,914 --> 00:19:31,279
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm proud of the program, and it was my idea with Sara, but I can't take credit for it all, because we couldn't have done it without volunteers and our staff that just worked around the clock to make it happen.

200
00:19:31,479 --> 00:19:33,360
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.

201
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:44,804
[SPEAKER_00]: So you talked a little bit about the way that your plans that you've started to implement and work on are including this lens of equity, but I wonder if you have thoughts about equity, like how to make Medford more equitable in the future.

202
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:49,802
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think we've made great strides, but we have a lot more to do.

203
00:19:49,822 --> 00:20:01,450
[SPEAKER_01]: About a year, maybe 14 months ago, we put out a social justice roadmap that kind of outlined everything we've been doing, everything we are working on and that we plan on doing.

204
00:20:01,930 --> 00:20:13,518
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, we also had a few, two community conversations just to hear about people's lived experiences, because I think that's how you gain the knowledge to know what is needed in our community.

205
00:20:14,956 --> 00:20:28,530
[SPEAKER_01]: With that and also our municipal vulnerability preparedness grant work that we're doing, we actually have liaisons going out into the community in trusted locations to learn about what people need.

206
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:35,136
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've worked a great deal on food insecurity and housing needs, especially during the pandemic.

207
00:20:35,857 --> 00:20:36,978
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot more work to do.

208
00:20:37,058 --> 00:20:38,460
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the main priorities

209
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:49,624
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to work on, and I actually just sent a woman an email today, is with the ARPA funding, I really want to try to get somebody in our communications team that can translate in different languages.

210
00:20:50,004 --> 00:20:59,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think knowledge is power, and getting more people involved in everything we do is a powerful thing and something that we need to work on.

211
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:04,210
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were able to get the translation line item finally approved in the fiscal year 22 budget.

212
00:21:07,586 --> 00:21:22,530
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the number one thing I want to work on in the next couple months, just getting somebody that can translate as much as we push out information-wise in especially the three different languages that are spoken other than English in this community.

213
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:31,952
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get people involved in our comprehensive plan and find out what the needs are of our community so we can shape our planning going forward.

214
00:21:32,672 --> 00:21:32,952
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.

215
00:21:33,212 --> 00:21:34,833
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you for that.

216
00:21:35,353 --> 00:21:39,854
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've talked about, you know, you've been a resident of Medford for a long time and your whole life, right?

217
00:21:39,874 --> 00:21:40,195
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that right?

218
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:40,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, my whole life.

219
00:21:40,915 --> 00:21:41,975
[SPEAKER_00]: Born and raised, yes.

220
00:21:42,155 --> 00:21:48,597
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so you've had different sort of interactions with the community, like in those different roles.

221
00:21:48,658 --> 00:21:55,600
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder if you could say kind of like what you most appreciate about this community or, you know, what it is that's like keeping you connected.

222
00:21:57,116 --> 00:22:03,862
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, I think it's the people and the diversity of what we are here in Medford.

223
00:22:03,902 --> 00:22:19,535
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, I get a lot of complaints all the time, but knowing what, like I said, our employees work on on a daily basis, and then knowing we have volunteers and people that are willing to step up no matter what they're asked, you know, we have finally

224
00:22:21,017 --> 00:22:35,967
[SPEAKER_01]: we implemented last week our 19th mini food pantry and at the vocational school and throughout this pandemic we've increased that number to 19 and everybody, it seems that everybody's stepping up to fill those pantries.

225
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,589
[SPEAKER_01]: So many people stepped up for the R U OK?

226
00:22:38,609 --> 00:22:39,170
[SPEAKER_01]: program.

227
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:43,133
[SPEAKER_01]: We have volunteers that serve on boards and commissions and

228
00:22:44,013 --> 00:22:46,714
[SPEAKER_01]: It's never a problem getting people to help out.

229
00:22:46,734 --> 00:22:58,778
[SPEAKER_01]: We just had, I think, three or four community members, just wanting to volunteer, step up and read seven lengthy applications for an OPM for our fire headquarters.

230
00:23:00,118 --> 00:23:11,664
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had to ask, you know, and they're educated, you know, they have other things to do, you know, just people who are really busy and they're still willing to help out.

231
00:23:11,704 --> 00:23:17,207
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think just not only our diversity, but it's just everybody wanting to work together for

232
00:23:18,503 --> 00:23:37,980
[SPEAKER_01]: You have that few percent that are loud and upset, but the majority, almost this whole community is willing to help a neighbor, help a friend, get involved and do great things so that we can just continue to make this place a better place for everybody who lives here.

233
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:41,203
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and we're talking too about like future generations.

234
00:23:41,263 --> 00:23:54,937
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like it's just such a good example to perpetuate and like to show our kids right like this like we can help people like to help people when we can right and like and Yeah, I feel like it's such a important value for them to see yeah All right help and educate.

235
00:23:55,137 --> 00:24:00,042
[SPEAKER_01]: I just was talking to Melanie McLaughlin from the school committee, and we're working on a

236
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:09,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, a mural for La Contre Rank and I made sure I sent the designs back and said, I want to make sure these are diverse, I want to make sure, on every level.

237
00:24:09,806 --> 00:24:13,347
[SPEAKER_01]: And what came back was a young girl on

238
00:24:15,117 --> 00:24:17,297
[SPEAKER_01]: a piece of equipment so she could play hockey.

239
00:24:17,417 --> 00:24:20,718
[SPEAKER_01]: And my kids were like, what is this picture of?

240
00:24:20,798 --> 00:24:23,919
[SPEAKER_01]: And I explained, this little girl's playing hockey.

241
00:24:23,959 --> 00:24:24,779
[SPEAKER_01]: How's she playing hockey?

242
00:24:24,819 --> 00:24:26,439
[SPEAKER_01]: She's sitting down, my son said.

243
00:24:26,479 --> 00:24:30,840
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, well, we're trying to show that anybody can play at any time.

244
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:35,321
[SPEAKER_01]: And she maybe doesn't have, something's wrong with her leg, or she has a disability.

245
00:24:35,381 --> 00:24:38,481
[SPEAKER_01]: And the awareness it brought to my son.

246
00:24:38,501 --> 00:24:43,462
[SPEAKER_01]: So inclusivity on all levels is just so important.

247
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,181
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, thank you.

248
00:24:45,581 --> 00:24:48,844
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so now it's time for the more fun questions, hopefully.

249
00:24:49,104 --> 00:24:50,946
[SPEAKER_00]: These aren't fun and informative.

250
00:24:51,386 --> 00:24:54,970
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could share something about yourself that might surprise us.

251
00:24:57,832 --> 00:24:59,554
[SPEAKER_01]: I wear a lot of hats.

252
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:01,976
[SPEAKER_01]: Mom, Mayor.

253
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:09,123
[SPEAKER_01]: But probably one of my, other than being with my children, one of my favorite things to do is coach.

254
00:25:09,383 --> 00:25:12,825
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been coaching basketball through St.

255
00:25:12,865 --> 00:25:13,685
[SPEAKER_01]: Francis and St.

256
00:25:13,725 --> 00:25:17,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Joseph's now for six years, seven years.

257
00:25:18,128 --> 00:25:21,630
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Girls on the Run is something that I love to coach.

258
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:26,993
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been doing it for myself and about nine other coaches have been doing it for four or five years.

259
00:25:28,356 --> 00:25:49,774
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the best ways to give back and this year our Girls on the Run team has 27 girls, most of them are third graders, they're the cutest little peanuts and just being able to influence them and have some fun once or twice a week with our students and kids is probably one of the best things I can do to give back to my own community.

260
00:25:50,054 --> 00:25:50,935
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds fun, yeah.

261
00:25:51,387 --> 00:25:56,672
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it must be cool for them to see, like, city officials sort of integrated in some of those, their day-to-day stuff.

262
00:25:56,732 --> 00:26:00,596
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, sometimes we'll see you drive by and we'll be like, talk to my son and say, hey, there's the mayor.

263
00:26:01,737 --> 00:26:04,980
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool, yeah.

264
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,245
[SPEAKER_01]: And my daughters have always been in the program, so I don't even think it's anything special that I'm coaching.

265
00:26:10,465 --> 00:26:12,246
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say it's Coach Aoife and

266
00:26:14,068 --> 00:26:21,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Coach Kelly, they only have boys, and they still take the time to volunteer for girls on the run.

267
00:26:21,695 --> 00:26:26,018
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you have Coach Nevers, who's a teacher, who just is always there.

268
00:26:26,058 --> 00:26:27,700
[SPEAKER_01]: She's been coaching with us since the start.

269
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:31,463
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the people that impress me, not necessarily myself.

270
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:38,589
[SPEAKER_01]: As kids in the program, my daughters have benefited from it greatly, and my now oldest is

271
00:26:39,590 --> 00:26:41,571
[SPEAKER_01]: running on two cross-country teams because of it.

272
00:26:41,751 --> 00:27:02,604
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go to the middle school meets, and even when they just went into sixth grade two years ago, our Girls in the Run girls got like top seven out of ten, and it was just pretty awesome to see that we've helped shape, you know, running something you can pick up for life, and we're helping to shape hundreds of girls' lives into the future.

273
00:27:02,845 --> 00:27:03,485
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty awesome.

274
00:27:03,725 --> 00:27:07,147
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm hoping to talk to Aoife, too, about Girls on the Run on the podcast, too.

275
00:27:07,207 --> 00:27:11,130
[SPEAKER_00]: And it did strike me that, you know, she does have two boys.

276
00:27:11,190 --> 00:27:19,875
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's equally as important to see, like, moms, like people, for boys, to see that example of, like, empowering girls and the importance of having that space.

277
00:27:19,895 --> 00:27:20,315
[SPEAKER_00]: It's powerful.

278
00:27:20,335 --> 00:27:20,795
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.

279
00:27:20,995 --> 00:27:26,219
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two girls, so I'm always saying girls can do anything boys can do.

280
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:28,500
[SPEAKER_01]: And now my little guy is seven, so now I

281
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:33,661
[SPEAKER_01]: With him having older sisters, I say, well, you can do anything girls can do.

282
00:27:33,701 --> 00:27:35,941
[SPEAKER_01]: You can always try as hard as your sisters.

283
00:27:36,161 --> 00:27:38,282
[SPEAKER_00]: Some strong role models for them there.

284
00:27:38,702 --> 00:27:39,622
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.

285
00:27:41,102 --> 00:27:46,243
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm wondering, too, about any advice that you've received that you would pass on.

286
00:27:49,104 --> 00:27:54,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the best advice I've been given lately, because I've spoken to a couple classes at the high school.

287
00:27:56,386 --> 00:28:04,773
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know even remember who necessarily gave me the advice, but if I can give anybody advice, it's try to always keep your cool.

288
00:28:04,793 --> 00:28:10,818
[SPEAKER_01]: I told the students that you're going to have tough times in life.

289
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:17,203
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have people that confront you or that might upset you over email, or always take

290
00:28:17,750 --> 00:28:19,291
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a minute to take a deep breath.

291
00:28:19,371 --> 00:28:27,634
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you need a night before you respond to that email or that letter or you get confronted and you say, why don't we talk about this tomorrow?

292
00:28:28,135 --> 00:28:37,799
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a few seconds or even 24 hours to digest it, to gain a calm head so that you can respond and not regret what you say.

293
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:45,022
[SPEAKER_01]: And always try to get your feelings out the right way versus just being responsive.

294
00:28:47,743 --> 00:28:49,523
[SPEAKER_01]: being too negative or yeah.

295
00:28:49,623 --> 00:28:55,205
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of what I've been telling people because I've been asked that question a couple times in the last couple months.

296
00:28:55,385 --> 00:29:17,010
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and Zach Bares was on here too and he had some similar advice sort of about like what it feels like when there when it feels like people are just in opposition to each other and like how to sort of be able to work in your role in that way when like there's when it seems like people are just kind of constantly in conflict and how to like respond to somebody who's approaching you in that way right and still be able to

297
00:29:17,630 --> 00:29:18,311
[SPEAKER_00]: move forward.

298
00:29:18,331 --> 00:29:28,518
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are all the questions that I prepared for you, but is there anything else that you want the voters to know about or anything that I haven't asked that you want to share?

299
00:29:30,565 --> 00:29:34,626
[SPEAKER_01]: I always just conclude by saying I'm an email or phone call away.

300
00:29:34,646 --> 00:29:46,429
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually try to start booking appointments at 9, 30, 10 in the morning so that I can make sure I clear out all my email as much as I can just to start my day off right.

301
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,890
[SPEAKER_01]: And in between meetings, I'm checking email.

302
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:54,672
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't take a lunch break unless I eat while I'm responding to residents.

303
00:29:54,712 --> 00:29:59,153
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try to respond to phone calls, even sometimes I'll

304
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:03,131
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to take in all the information.

305
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:13,556
[SPEAKER_01]: If I go out for a walk and somebody stops me with an issue or a concern, sometimes I won't even remember to respond right away to being approached.

306
00:30:13,636 --> 00:30:17,858
[SPEAKER_01]: But a month later, I'll say, I have to continue to work on that.

307
00:30:17,898 --> 00:30:22,200
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I remember so-and-so said this was an issue.

308
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:25,682
[SPEAKER_01]: I just try to take everything in and always do the right thing.

309
00:30:25,962 --> 00:30:26,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

310
00:30:26,682 --> 00:30:27,243
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

311
00:30:27,343 --> 00:30:29,003
[SPEAKER_00]: So email is a good way to get in touch with you.

312
00:30:29,584 --> 00:30:30,424
[SPEAKER_00]: Email's good.

313
00:30:30,624 --> 00:30:30,924
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

314
00:30:31,004 --> 00:30:31,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Email's good.

315
00:30:31,565 --> 00:30:34,266
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm trying to be as responsive as I can.

316
00:30:34,306 --> 00:30:34,906
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.

317
00:30:35,146 --> 00:30:35,987
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much appreciated.

318
00:30:36,307 --> 00:30:36,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

319
00:30:36,927 --> 00:30:38,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks so much for coming on and good luck next week.

320
00:30:39,168 --> 00:30:39,448
