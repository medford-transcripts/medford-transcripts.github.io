[SPEAKER_17]: With that, Paola, unless you need more time to get settled, I'll pass it to you.

34
00:25:36,859 --> 00:25:38,260
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, thank you.

35
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,301
[SPEAKER_12]: This seems very loud.

36
00:25:42,561 --> 00:25:43,242
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you very much.

37
00:25:43,302 --> 00:25:45,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, the traffic was crazy.

38
00:25:49,418 --> 00:25:51,822
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to share the presentation that we have.

39
00:26:12,442 --> 00:26:13,023
[SPEAKER_12]: There we go.

40
00:26:13,343 --> 00:26:32,578
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, as we usually do, we will talk about the process timeline, what is planned for the 2025, the opportunities for public comments, and we will look into the squares, Medford Square, West Medford Square, and then a little bit about the ADUs.

41
00:26:35,628 --> 00:26:51,187
[SPEAKER_12]: So today we're looking at the squares, we will look in the next ones at other corridors, we're in the commercial framework, we did the residential neighborhoods, and we are now at the commercial framework.

42
00:26:53,182 --> 00:27:03,271
[SPEAKER_12]: At the city board, we will be looking next week in May 7th, the proposal that we are working for the residential districts.

43
00:27:04,112 --> 00:27:08,636
[SPEAKER_12]: So everyone interested will be great to have you and your input.

44
00:27:09,857 --> 00:27:18,885
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we are planning a public Q&A on May 8th, also next week for the squares and the ADU topic.

45
00:27:20,102 --> 00:27:30,715
[SPEAKER_12]: We will also have another public Q&A for May 29th about the corridors and for June 9th about parking and TDM.

46
00:27:33,398 --> 00:27:35,639
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, sorry, I need to cut my breath.

47
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:45,605
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so what we're doing is, um, bringing into zoning what was done in the comprehensive plan in January 2023.

48
00:27:46,605 --> 00:27:49,026
[SPEAKER_12]: Also from the climate action adaptation plan.

49
00:27:49,607 --> 00:28:01,033
[SPEAKER_12]: And so all the things that were identified that talk or are related to zoning, we are doing a review on your current zoning to bring those principles in.

50
00:28:04,789 --> 00:28:08,351
[SPEAKER_12]: In here is always the vision map that came from that comprehensive plan.

51
00:28:08,911 --> 00:28:16,055
[SPEAKER_12]: There were different areas that were identified like quarters squares, the residential districts and their densities.

52
00:28:16,856 --> 00:28:22,719
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we are working on those areas, as in, as was done in the comprehensive plan.

53
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:33,243
[SPEAKER_12]: So just because it is all in interrelated, I know that we are working on the commercial framework.

54
00:28:33,263 --> 00:28:37,369
[SPEAKER_12]: We just wanted to show what is around these squares and quarters.

55
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:38,710
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the

56
00:28:41,392 --> 00:28:46,876
[SPEAKER_12]: The proposal that it came from recommended from the city council to the city board.

57
00:28:46,896 --> 00:28:48,697
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is the one we are working now.

58
00:28:48,717 --> 00:28:53,641
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is the latest version, official version.

59
00:28:53,681 --> 00:28:58,344
[SPEAKER_12]: We are working now in another one for next week for to present to the city board.

60
00:28:58,764 --> 00:29:02,888
[SPEAKER_12]: But everything is connected, so that's why we also wanted to present it here.

61
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:12,536
[SPEAKER_12]: And what we have is neighborhood residential one, neighborhood residential two, neighborhood residential three, urban residential one, and urban residential two.

62
00:29:13,037 --> 00:29:19,002
[SPEAKER_12]: And this goes from the lowest density to the highest density in urban residential two.

63
00:29:20,663 --> 00:29:24,567
[SPEAKER_12]: We can get more in depth, but just I wanted to go a little bit quickly.

64
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:31,062
[SPEAKER_12]: So these are all the commercial framework that we are looking into.

65
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:36,784
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have here the squares, the quarters, and then some special districts.

66
00:29:38,685 --> 00:29:41,986
[SPEAKER_12]: And here are those districts separated.

67
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:50,734
[SPEAKER_12]: So we presented in March in 12, the commercial framework, and this was the base that we were working on.

68
00:29:51,575 --> 00:30:01,361
[SPEAKER_12]: We already worked in their approved Mystic and Salem Street.

69
00:30:02,062 --> 00:30:04,043
[SPEAKER_12]: And now we're working on the squares.

70
00:30:04,603 --> 00:30:07,725
[SPEAKER_12]: And those are the ones that we will look today, Medford Square and West Medford.

71
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:11,528
[SPEAKER_12]: And later on, we will bring the other quarters.

72
00:30:13,307 --> 00:30:19,691
[SPEAKER_12]: So for Medford Square, we always look into their current zoning and what is their existing.

73
00:30:20,332 --> 00:30:24,554
[SPEAKER_12]: We have the commercial one, apartment two, general residential and single family one.

74
00:30:26,636 --> 00:30:37,943
[SPEAKER_12]: If anyone has any questions of what this mean, we already saw this, so I'm just going to be a little bit quick, but if anyone has any question, we will come back to this.

75
00:30:39,378 --> 00:30:53,206
[SPEAKER_12]: This was the first proposal, and so what we are going to show today is mainly what changes we have done to the proposal that we did some weeks ago and presented here.

76
00:30:54,567 --> 00:31:03,292
[SPEAKER_12]: The first thing that we are going to look into was this area, West Clippership Drive.

77
00:31:04,673 --> 00:31:14,937
[SPEAKER_12]: So, and along the 93, it was asked if we could look into having mixed-use 3 in that area instead of only mixed-use 2.

78
00:31:16,117 --> 00:31:21,659
[SPEAKER_12]: So what we have right now is mixed-use 1, mixed-use 2a, mixed-use 2b, and mixed-use 3.

79
00:31:22,219 --> 00:31:29,602
[SPEAKER_12]: Mixed-use 1 is the small scale, and then the mixed-use 3 will be the higher intensity.

80
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:36,652
[SPEAKER_12]: We also looked and revised the heights for this mixed use districts.

81
00:31:36,913 --> 00:31:41,360
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's why I'm not going to say this one's but I'm going to go to our new proposal.

82
00:31:42,947 --> 00:31:56,313
[SPEAKER_12]: So in our new proposal, we said that we were going to look into the area next to the 93 so that we could do a section and see how that will reflect if we go higher, how it would seem.

83
00:31:58,033 --> 00:32:00,975
[SPEAKER_12]: And I will show in the next slide that section.

84
00:32:03,056 --> 00:32:06,137
[SPEAKER_12]: So what we are doing now is going to mix use one.

85
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,038
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be four stories by right.

86
00:32:08,758 --> 00:32:12,019
[SPEAKER_12]: and then we give one plus as an incentive zoning.

87
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:15,959
[SPEAKER_12]: This is when the developer will have to negotiate.

88
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:29,301
[SPEAKER_12]: And from a list of proposals, they would have to choose one of the benefits that will go to the community so that they can increase their density.

89
00:32:29,582 --> 00:32:32,362
[SPEAKER_12]: This is basically what the incentive zoning means.

90
00:32:33,502 --> 00:32:37,543
[SPEAKER_12]: So to give back to the community and they get that extra density

91
00:32:38,563 --> 00:32:40,885
[SPEAKER_12]: So in Mixed Use 1, they can only get plus one.

92
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:45,908
[SPEAKER_12]: If we go to Mixed Use 2A, it will be five stories by right plus two.

93
00:32:46,128 --> 00:32:49,811
[SPEAKER_12]: That will mean seven with incentive zoning maximum.

94
00:32:51,292 --> 00:32:56,835
[SPEAKER_12]: Mixed Use 2B is seven stories by right and then plus two as incentive zoning.

95
00:32:57,556 --> 00:33:02,159
[SPEAKER_12]: And then Mixed Use 3 would be eight by right and four as incentive zoning.

96
00:33:03,139 --> 00:33:05,582
[SPEAKER_12]: So these are new in this proposal.

97
00:33:06,082 --> 00:33:13,570
[SPEAKER_12]: We have added, increased a little bit that high by right, and then with the same incentive zoning.

98
00:33:15,241 --> 00:33:18,103
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, we also have some neighborhood residential three.

99
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:21,065
[SPEAKER_12]: This is this means that it can go up to three units.

100
00:33:21,905 --> 00:33:24,807
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, then we can have some historic conversion.

101
00:33:24,847 --> 00:33:31,612
[SPEAKER_12]: And this is, um, adopting an existing house that has to be at least 75 years old.

102
00:33:32,432 --> 00:33:34,814
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and that can trigger the historic conversion.

103
00:33:35,374 --> 00:33:41,559
[SPEAKER_12]: meaning that you can divide inside into in here we have up to four units.

104
00:33:43,621 --> 00:33:47,204
[SPEAKER_12]: And obviously you need to would need to follow the rest of the requirements.

105
00:33:47,785 --> 00:33:54,991
[SPEAKER_12]: But if you have the space and all the requirements covered, you could go up to four units and then the ADU.

106
00:33:56,312 --> 00:34:03,155
[SPEAKER_12]: and urban residential one goes up to multiplex and here is up to six units.

107
00:34:03,195 --> 00:34:16,842
[SPEAKER_12]: So from two unit historic conversion up to five units, townhouse, three unit dwelling and multiplex up to, multiplex is a building that will, that allows from four to six units.

108
00:34:17,663 --> 00:34:22,185
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the ADU only would be applied to one, two and three unit.

109
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,702
[SPEAKER_12]: So here's the section that I was talking about.

110
00:34:26,722 --> 00:34:31,649
[SPEAKER_12]: The section is like cutting through them.

111
00:34:32,089 --> 00:34:39,859
[SPEAKER_12]: And somebody said, explain it like if you have a cake and you cut the cake in half, when you open it, you can see all the layers.

112
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,522
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought that was genius.

113
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:42,742
[SPEAKER_12]: explanation.

114
00:34:43,283 --> 00:34:44,103
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is the same.

115
00:34:44,143 --> 00:34:52,607
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like if we cut the building to see all the layers and what we have inside and how that relates into the street and the surroundings.

116
00:34:52,687 --> 00:34:58,750
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have the 93 in this area that in this where we cut is already going a little bit up.

117
00:34:59,911 --> 00:35:01,331
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have that high difference.

118
00:35:02,672 --> 00:35:11,685
[SPEAKER_12]: We can definitely go up to the 12th stories with the incentive zoning so it's eight as of right and then plus four with incentive zoning.

119
00:35:12,546 --> 00:35:15,490
[SPEAKER_12]: There is no shadow towards the minister to the city hall.

120
00:35:15,510 --> 00:35:17,233
[SPEAKER_12]: Other is the space enough.

121
00:35:17,953 --> 00:35:37,555
[SPEAKER_12]: and what we recommend, this is just a suggestion, we are not saying that the building has to be in like this in any way, but we suggest the parking going up to the back towards 93, so there will be enough space and you can go up to three layers, this is nothing of this mandatory, we're just suggesting that something like this could be done.

122
00:35:40,103 --> 00:35:41,886
[SPEAKER_12]: But we also want the active frontage.

123
00:35:41,926 --> 00:35:47,137
[SPEAKER_12]: So the front towards Clippership Drive, we propose the commercial use.

124
00:35:47,477 --> 00:35:49,702
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's why we put the parking on the back.

125
00:35:51,802 --> 00:36:08,369
[SPEAKER_12]: And then what we wanted to talk also is about those development standards that last time we didn't explain and were asked by the public how these new developments will look with the existing

126
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:11,512
[SPEAKER_12]: residential neighborhoods.

127
00:36:11,572 --> 00:36:16,278
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we cut again during a section is the S10.

128
00:36:16,798 --> 00:36:22,105
[SPEAKER_12]: So we go from Salem Street and cut towards Garden Street.

129
00:36:22,505 --> 00:36:25,629
[SPEAKER_12]: Here we have single unit dwellings.

130
00:36:26,531 --> 00:36:27,572
[SPEAKER_12]: How that will look like?

131
00:36:28,148 --> 00:36:36,238
[SPEAKER_12]: And so what we want to make clear is that in the zoning, of course, we allow in this area, I think it was up to six stories.

132
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:45,290
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's seven by right, and you can go up to two more with the incentive zoning.

133
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:51,033
[SPEAKER_12]: So in this case, what we have are two development standards that also will apply.

134
00:36:51,053 --> 00:37:02,080
[SPEAKER_12]: And so if you have the existing housing, this is in a residential district, you go up to the maximum height from your lot line.

135
00:37:03,281 --> 00:37:10,366
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you will increasing the height in an angle of 45 degrees angle.

136
00:37:10,986 --> 00:37:13,748
[SPEAKER_12]: So in this case, if we have lot one in here,

137
00:37:14,628 --> 00:37:20,253
[SPEAKER_12]: and lot two in here, we could only develop up to six with this strategy.

138
00:37:20,653 --> 00:37:31,482
[SPEAKER_12]: Gardiner Street is not a very wide area, street, and so we don't have a lot of space to go up to the eighth or the ninth with incentive zoning.

139
00:37:32,182 --> 00:37:36,607
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is one of the development standards that will protect the existing residential.

140
00:37:37,147 --> 00:37:41,111
[SPEAKER_12]: And the second one that we would like to propose is the minimum daylight standard.

141
00:37:41,732 --> 00:37:46,497
[SPEAKER_12]: And this, this means that we have to ensure in this we need to study how to do it.

142
00:37:47,278 --> 00:37:50,842
[SPEAKER_12]: We will look into examples national and regional level.

143
00:37:53,164 --> 00:38:00,971
[SPEAKER_12]: It is done to promote sustainability and to build more sustainable where we have to ensure minimum daylight.

144
00:38:01,591 --> 00:38:14,984
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we are taking that strategy and bringing it in so that the new development cannot go under this daylight standard for the surrounding neighbors.

145
00:38:15,604 --> 00:38:18,345
[SPEAKER_12]: So we need to establish what that minimum daylight is.

146
00:38:18,825 --> 00:38:34,829
[SPEAKER_12]: What I have seen in other countries is that from an average, and they take the darkest months of the year, they ask for a minimum hour average a day in those months.

147
00:38:35,049 --> 00:38:40,690
[SPEAKER_12]: And that would be, depends on the cities, depends on the countries, around two and a half, three hours a day.

148
00:38:41,450 --> 00:38:41,750
[SPEAKER_12]: the parking lot.

149
00:38:41,770 --> 00:38:52,697
[SPEAKER_12]: Um so we will look into that if that's something that in its is of interest, and with that we will also ensure in this case, for example, that the lot one could only go up to four stories.

150
00:38:53,578 --> 00:38:58,981
[SPEAKER_12]: Now there's also a very important requirement that we are always talking about it, and that is the parking requirements.

151
00:38:59,061 --> 00:39:03,824
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we have only this lot in this area in the situation, we barely have the

152
00:39:09,828 --> 00:39:18,683
[SPEAKER_12]: take parking somewhere else or share or do something because it wouldn't be able to actually allow a lot of parking.

153
00:39:18,763 --> 00:39:21,087
[SPEAKER_12]: So that will be another requirement that will

154
00:39:22,958 --> 00:39:24,599
[SPEAKER_12]: not be able to go very high.

155
00:39:26,059 --> 00:39:30,281
[SPEAKER_12]: So those are the things that we need to take into account every time that we study this.

156
00:39:30,981 --> 00:39:32,581
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, this is option one.

157
00:39:32,841 --> 00:39:36,263
[SPEAKER_12]: What would it happen if we have lot one and lot two be combined?

158
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:48,587
[SPEAKER_12]: Then that will allow us to have a bigger setback that these development could share parking in the middle so we can activate both fronts.

159
00:39:49,207 --> 00:39:56,812
[SPEAKER_12]: and so that we could also go higher and not disturbing the residential in front of them.

160
00:39:57,492 --> 00:40:10,420
[SPEAKER_12]: So there are always options to go higher and get to the maximum that the districts allow, but then you will need to take care also with these development standards that the neighbors are protected.

161
00:40:13,868 --> 00:40:21,032
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you want to talk about maybe Medford Square, if there are any comments, and then we can continue with West Medford Square?

162
00:40:21,613 --> 00:40:23,194
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, thank you, Paula, for that overview.

163
00:40:23,274 --> 00:40:30,318
[SPEAKER_17]: I do think we should probably go through Medford Square in totality before we move on to West Medford Square, just to keep things organized, if that's okay.

164
00:40:31,919 --> 00:40:32,640
[SPEAKER_17]: Great, thank you.

165
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:37,323
[SPEAKER_17]: So before we move on, if you wouldn't mind, let's go back to

166
00:40:38,484 --> 00:40:51,478
[SPEAKER_17]: I suspect I'm not the only Councilor who wants to spend at least a moment comparing Medford Square Proposal 1 and Proposal 2, just so that we're all clear on the changes to the map that were made since we talked about this three weeks ago.

167
00:40:54,509 --> 00:40:56,751
[SPEAKER_17]: So for folks who weren't at our meeting, three weeks ago.

168
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,014
[SPEAKER_17]: Welcome and if you were, thank you for being there.

169
00:40:59,995 --> 00:41:02,918
[SPEAKER_17]: Or maybe it was four weeks ago at this point I'm mixing up my squares I apologize.

170
00:41:03,879 --> 00:41:12,808
[SPEAKER_17]: We had a robust detailed discussion about the draft zoning map at that time was the first time we had seen a map proposal put forward for Medford square.

171
00:41:14,429 --> 00:41:22,235
[SPEAKER_17]: And there were several suggestions from members of the community and from Councilors about specific sections of the map that we were curious about or wanted to see.

172
00:41:23,876 --> 00:41:28,599
[SPEAKER_17]: If there was another an alternate sub district assignment that might make more sense.

173
00:41:28,679 --> 00:41:37,406
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a wide ranging conversation if you want all that context I encourage folks to watch the meeting back it's linked on the zoning website on the city on the city page.

174
00:41:40,227 --> 00:41:43,229
[SPEAKER_17]: So I just wanted to take another beat with this before we moved on.

175
00:41:43,429 --> 00:41:51,395
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Paola, for the, on the Proposal 2 image you mentioned, and there was a new section study done.

176
00:41:51,455 --> 00:41:55,478
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for the area to the east of Clippership Drive.

177
00:41:55,818 --> 00:42:01,983
[SPEAKER_17]: That was one of the things we spent a good amount of time on a month ago asking, is this an area that could be appropriate for even

178
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:30,380
[SPEAKER_17]: more height and somebody made the suggestion, not me, though I'm very sympathetic to it, that it's in a way that you can argue it's advantageous to have your maximum heights right next to a highway because there aren't abutters on the highway, there are only commuters and it also provides a visual and sound barrier from the surrounding business districts and residential districts to the highway, which can be nice because the highway is quite noisy, air pollution and whatnot.

179
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:45,364
[SPEAKER_17]: So this map reflects a switch to MX3 on those parcels to the east of Clippership Drive, whereas it used to be a mix of MX2 and MX3.

180
00:42:48,105 --> 00:42:50,026
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll go to Councilor Leming.

181
00:42:50,066 --> 00:42:52,886
[SPEAKER_17]: I know this was an issue of note for you at our previous meeting.

182
00:42:56,287 --> 00:42:58,048
[SPEAKER_04]: No, if you wanted to finish your

183
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:14,998
[SPEAKER_04]: Your point on that, I was just gonna ask Senior Planner Evans had mentioned at the last meeting on this, a report that had been written some years ago on the justifications for the traffic patterns through Medford Square.

184
00:43:15,018 --> 00:43:16,939
[SPEAKER_04]: I was wondering if you ever managed to find that.

185
00:43:16,959 --> 00:43:19,120
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it was the Iannis report.

186
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,361
[SPEAKER_04]: You had, I think, I believe you emailed me about it.

187
00:43:31,390 --> 00:43:32,191
[SPEAKER_14]: Which button is there?

188
00:43:32,211 --> 00:43:32,651
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

189
00:43:34,372 --> 00:43:39,335
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, through the chair, Councilor Leming, I do owe you that report.

190
00:43:39,395 --> 00:43:41,977
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, I was on vacation last week and I am behind.

191
00:43:42,878 --> 00:43:45,139
[SPEAKER_14]: I will see if I can find it.

192
00:43:45,179 --> 00:43:46,600
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm gonna have to do some.

193
00:43:47,641 --> 00:43:55,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I tried doing some Googling on it, because it is something I'd like to read a bit more about, but I don't know if it's stored somewhere internally.

194
00:43:55,646 --> 00:43:58,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I just think it would be some interesting context.

195
00:43:58,376 --> 00:44:05,962
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so it's not a report about Medford or how wide the city of Medford landed on this traffic pattern.

196
00:44:06,482 --> 00:44:08,003
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of a mystery to me.

197
00:44:10,405 --> 00:44:12,306
[SPEAKER_14]: I know it's changed several times over the years.

198
00:44:12,346 --> 00:44:13,787
[SPEAKER_14]: You can look at old Sanborn maps.

199
00:44:13,847 --> 00:44:16,089
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really interesting to see how it used to look.

200
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:28,687
[SPEAKER_14]: But the study that I was referencing was how a city in Massachusetts undid the damage of a one-way circulation pattern.

201
00:44:30,276 --> 00:44:43,940
[SPEAKER_14]: and that it created opportunities for economic development and actually reduced vehicle miles being traveled within the square and made them safer.

202
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:51,402
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not to get too off topic from the current proposal, but are there any resources that you know of that could shed some light on that mystery?

203
00:44:51,422 --> 00:44:58,644
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I've often wondered about the history behind these particular traffic patterns and why

204
00:44:59,544 --> 00:45:02,966
[SPEAKER_04]: certain decisions were made.

205
00:45:02,986 --> 00:45:12,132
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd just be interested in any resource that you might know about that could offer a little bit of context for that.

206
00:45:12,152 --> 00:45:20,456
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, I can reach out to the DPW director or engineering to see what they might have.

207
00:45:21,037 --> 00:45:24,659
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure it's all in paper form somewhere.

208
00:45:26,887 --> 00:45:31,728
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, otherwise now I am, um Speaking to the proposal itself.

209
00:45:32,028 --> 00:45:32,869
[SPEAKER_04]: I am pleased with that.

210
00:45:32,929 --> 00:45:41,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Glad to see that little the plot by City Hall was updated to MX three.

211
00:45:41,431 --> 00:45:48,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, which Pretty sure that I'm the person here who lives the nearest to that of anybody.

212
00:45:48,333 --> 00:45:52,834
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think you'll create a very nice, uh, Very nice sound barrier.

213
00:45:53,294 --> 00:45:55,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, generally

214
00:45:56,122 --> 00:46:06,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Generally speaking, I know that Paolo last time talked about sort of the limitations of some of these plots of land.

215
00:46:06,706 --> 00:46:15,249
[SPEAKER_04]: So you listed concerns that some of these are maybe too thin or too small to house certain story limitations.

216
00:46:15,469 --> 00:46:19,211
[SPEAKER_04]: So I assume that you looked into that and you found that it was fine.

217
00:46:21,755 --> 00:46:24,177
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so that is why we did the section.

218
00:46:25,538 --> 00:46:28,921
[SPEAKER_12]: Because in this area, the lots are quite big.

219
00:46:29,561 --> 00:46:36,126
[SPEAKER_12]: It seemed very narrow, that area, but it actually, you can do the building, no problem.

220
00:46:36,426 --> 00:46:39,709
[SPEAKER_12]: You would need to combine those two, because it's divided into parcels.

221
00:46:40,229 --> 00:46:43,912
[SPEAKER_12]: So you would need to combine the two, but it would be possible.

222
00:46:50,285 --> 00:46:50,445
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

223
00:46:50,565 --> 00:46:51,926
[SPEAKER_17]: Anything more at this time, Councilor Lemon?

224
00:46:52,326 --> 00:46:52,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope, nope.

225
00:46:52,846 --> 00:46:53,547
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all for me.

226
00:46:53,607 --> 00:46:53,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

227
00:46:54,147 --> 00:46:54,467
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

228
00:46:54,967 --> 00:46:55,548
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you very much.

229
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:02,511
[SPEAKER_17]: Check Zoom for hands from my fellow Councilors.

230
00:47:02,831 --> 00:47:03,291
[SPEAKER_17]: Seeing none.

231
00:47:06,018 --> 00:47:08,359
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, I have a few comments to make before I do.

232
00:47:08,379 --> 00:47:11,621
[SPEAKER_17]: There were a couple things I forgot to mention at the beginning of the meeting.

233
00:47:12,142 --> 00:47:14,723
[SPEAKER_17]: One of them is for folks who are not familiar with our committee meetings.

234
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:19,065
[SPEAKER_17]: We do take public participation for each section at the end of the section.

235
00:47:20,006 --> 00:47:22,587
[SPEAKER_17]: So for anybody who has a question or a comment, we will absolutely get to you.

236
00:47:22,627 --> 00:47:25,569
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll just go through discussion with councilors and city staff first.

237
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:32,173
[SPEAKER_17]: And also for folks who are not on the Zoom, we put this in the chat, but if you're

238
00:47:33,213 --> 00:47:42,719
[SPEAKER_17]: that we're looking at on zoom this evening and finding it hard to look at all of these materials that will be looking at tonight are listed.

239
00:47:42,739 --> 00:47:47,963
[SPEAKER_17]: On the city council's public portal, so you can find that from the city website.

240
00:47:48,083 --> 00:47:52,145
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you go to tonight's meeting, you'll be able to view them in higher resolution at home.

241
00:47:54,227 --> 00:47:54,507
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

242
00:47:54,567 --> 00:47:55,568
[SPEAKER_17]: I forgot to mention that earlier.

243
00:47:57,028 --> 00:47:58,229
[SPEAKER_17]: So moving back to the proposal.

244
00:48:00,923 --> 00:48:04,365
[SPEAKER_17]: really appreciate the adjustments that have been made since last time.

245
00:48:04,425 --> 00:48:10,149
[SPEAKER_17]: This addresses a lot of my requests and questions, speaking as one Councilor.

246
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:19,736
[SPEAKER_17]: Before we move on, I was just hoping if we could quickly get a walk through any other changes to the map that were made.

247
00:48:20,077 --> 00:48:23,000
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm not seeing a ton, I just kind of want that confirmed.

248
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:28,685
[SPEAKER_17]: I know one other, I had the same request as Councilor Leming regarding the parcels that are now MX3 east of Clippership Drive.

249
00:48:31,467 --> 00:48:39,193
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, I also last time had a question about the parcels south of High Street that are currently assigned MX one.

250
00:48:39,233 --> 00:48:42,495
[SPEAKER_17]: Just curious if MX to a would help create.

251
00:48:43,055 --> 00:48:47,919
[SPEAKER_17]: I was my concern was about the transition from MX one to MX to a, um

252
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:59,839
[SPEAKER_17]: And relatedly also had some requests and questions about if it would be appropriate to kind of upshift a lot of MX2 and MX3 from MX2a to MX2b, from MX2b to MX3.

253
00:49:02,379 --> 00:49:14,627
[SPEAKER_17]: Based on my non-zoning expert look at these maps this evening, I'm not seeing a lot of changes to the colors on the map except for the now all-magenta part to the east.

254
00:49:14,787 --> 00:49:19,810
[SPEAKER_17]: However, what the colors mean has been tweaked a little bit, as you said earlier, Paula.

255
00:49:21,932 --> 00:49:35,287
[SPEAKER_17]: which I think gets at least some of what the discussion centered around last time saying, you know, the places where it's really appropriate to have more height so that we can enjoy things like more housing units close to this nexus of the community.

256
00:49:37,429 --> 00:49:46,215
[SPEAKER_17]: more people to patronize businesses, more businesses, more ability to hide parking underneath development so that there's still parking but it's not taking up active street space.

257
00:49:46,235 --> 00:49:50,878
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm really happy to see those increases in by right height.

258
00:49:50,898 --> 00:49:53,780
[SPEAKER_17]: So I was just hoping if you could speak to that rationale just quickly.

259
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:57,222
[SPEAKER_17]: I think you did mention that it's only the by right heights that have changed.

260
00:49:57,262 --> 00:50:00,805
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no change to the number of incentive zoning floors that could be added.

261
00:50:01,786 --> 00:50:02,948
[SPEAKER_17]: if developers achieve that.

262
00:50:05,213 --> 00:50:06,876
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'm happy to see this upshifting.

263
00:50:06,916 --> 00:50:08,299
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it makes sense to do it in this way.

264
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:13,128
[SPEAKER_17]: But if you wouldn't mind just kind of providing a summary of those changes before we go on, I think that'd be helpful.

265
00:50:19,845 --> 00:50:22,806
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, so you're completely right.

266
00:50:23,967 --> 00:50:32,370
[SPEAKER_12]: We just in the color shifting was only the area that we talked about from to be to mix use three.

267
00:50:33,730 --> 00:50:38,272
[SPEAKER_12]: The rest what we did was to permit a little bit higher by right.

268
00:50:39,272 --> 00:50:43,437
[SPEAKER_12]: So now in mixes one we would have four stories by right with incentive zoning.

269
00:50:44,118 --> 00:50:47,362
[SPEAKER_12]: It's one more so we have in total five.

270
00:50:49,765 --> 00:50:55,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Then mixes to a will be five stories by right, plus two with incentive zoning.

271
00:50:56,432 --> 00:51:16,641
[SPEAKER_12]: mixes to be seven stories by right plus two incentive zoning and then mixes three we did now eight stories by right and then plus four so in total is the same but by right there we're having six plus six and now in mixes three what we did is eight stories by right and then four with incentive zoning.

272
00:51:19,645 --> 00:51:28,132
[SPEAKER_12]: Why, um, there are some in south of the high street, those that are in mixed use one this week.

273
00:51:28,532 --> 00:51:38,300
[SPEAKER_12]: We did the analysis last time we did the section in in high street cutting those areas, and those are not very deep.

274
00:51:39,481 --> 00:51:41,543
[SPEAKER_12]: Also, there are a lot of historic buildings.

275
00:51:42,403 --> 00:51:46,227
[SPEAKER_12]: So we would like to preserve that front as historic.

276
00:51:46,287 --> 00:51:47,848
[SPEAKER_12]: We will also discuss later on

277
00:51:48,368 --> 00:52:01,179
[SPEAKER_12]: that we will want to bring some development standards for historic preservation, but so that we can increase height but not, I will pass that to Emily later on.

278
00:52:02,741 --> 00:52:10,788
[SPEAKER_12]: But in this area we have the river, so we really don't have the space to, the others can be combined, they can grow in different areas or directions.

279
00:52:11,408 --> 00:52:15,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Here there is only very, it will be very thin and long.

280
00:52:17,532 --> 00:52:24,977
[SPEAKER_12]: So we also think that it's better to have some kind of diversity in the high diversity also in this area.

281
00:52:25,397 --> 00:52:28,879
[SPEAKER_12]: So this front is also towards the south.

282
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:36,144
[SPEAKER_12]: This means that we'll project the shadow and cut the views to the river and project the shadow to the north.

283
00:52:37,605 --> 00:52:40,647
[SPEAKER_12]: So this will be a better sunny spot in this area.

284
00:52:41,527 --> 00:52:50,056
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, if it's possible to push it to A and B five stories by height and then two more.

285
00:52:50,076 --> 00:52:58,644
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's a little bit too high, but yeah, it could be done if that's the wish of the public and the City Council and City staff.

286
00:53:02,003 --> 00:53:02,943
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for that explanation.

287
00:53:02,963 --> 00:53:03,784
[SPEAKER_17]: I really appreciate it.

288
00:53:03,844 --> 00:53:14,368
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'll be curious to hear if any of my fellow councillors have an opinion on if that would be valuable or if it seems right as is.

289
00:53:14,388 --> 00:53:15,548
[SPEAKER_17]: Go to Councilor Leming.

290
00:53:18,749 --> 00:53:27,533
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to ask about some of the incentives that you pointed out, the differences and how they were updated, so not directly.

291
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:37,561
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just curious on MX3 being changed from 6 plus 6 to 8 plus 4.

292
00:53:38,901 --> 00:53:43,944
[SPEAKER_04]: In practice, in other communities, how often are these incentives taken up?

293
00:53:44,184 --> 00:53:49,387
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I really would like it that people take advantage of the green score.

294
00:53:52,075 --> 00:54:01,019
[SPEAKER_04]: TDM, hopefully once we start discussing that in June, with these additional stories for buildings.

295
00:54:01,059 --> 00:54:09,063
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'd just like to know, what I'm thinking is like a developer could just say, well, I already got eight stories, that's high enough.

296
00:54:09,103 --> 00:54:11,624
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't have to take advantage of the additional four stories.

297
00:54:12,645 --> 00:54:15,606
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas six plus six, they might not be thinking that as much.

298
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:16,587
[SPEAKER_04]: So how,

299
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:23,671
[SPEAKER_04]: How often in practice do you see people taking advantage of these height incentives and other places?

300
00:54:31,613 --> 00:54:36,755
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've seen some studies, and that depends really on how the incentive zonings are done.

301
00:54:39,658 --> 00:54:47,768
[SPEAKER_12]: in I think it was in Seattle, they had 50% of the buildings would adhere and increase their density with incentive zoning.

302
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:53,915
[SPEAKER_12]: So, and that it depends on how that then you will tweak it further on.

303
00:54:55,957 --> 00:54:58,861
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think that if we

304
00:54:59,899 --> 00:55:10,268
[SPEAKER_12]: When you give four more, then that will trigger some of those additional costs of the extra structure costs, et cetera, to make it that high.

305
00:55:11,709 --> 00:55:13,511
[SPEAKER_12]: And then you will get a lot of the revenue.

306
00:55:13,551 --> 00:55:16,894
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think that it will be more economically feasible to do that.

307
00:55:17,774 --> 00:55:21,798
[SPEAKER_12]: When you are in six, you would need to trigger

308
00:55:23,191 --> 00:55:29,513
[SPEAKER_12]: The thing is that we also need to think about when the structure starts to get also a lot more expensive.

309
00:55:30,353 --> 00:55:46,657
[SPEAKER_12]: And so if you just, if we are in eight and then you go for the other four, maybe it's easier to trigger that than with six that you don't have to go for that extra structure cost.

310
00:55:47,277 --> 00:55:48,837
[SPEAKER_12]: And so you might stay with the six.

311
00:55:49,197 --> 00:55:52,438
[SPEAKER_12]: That's, I don't know if you want to address more.

312
00:55:56,424 --> 00:56:04,450
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll just add and I for the for the record Emily innocent and associates apologize for the mask I'm coming down with that spring cold that everybody seems to have.

313
00:56:06,311 --> 00:56:11,615
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to add that palace correct the the differences when you transition from stick built to steal.

314
00:56:12,336 --> 00:56:17,600
[SPEAKER_15]: So you can go up to I think it's six stories on the stick built or you can, which you can then place on a podium.

315
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:26,142
[SPEAKER_15]: But to transition to steel, you want to make it worth the developers while if so it's to be able to do that.

316
00:56:26,602 --> 00:56:36,363
[SPEAKER_15]: So when we're thinking about the height differentials, we're also trying to peg that to when the developer has to make a decision on the building code, and which one they'd rather go for.

317
00:56:36,464 --> 00:56:43,445
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think Councilor Leming your question is a good one, and we'll continue to evaluate the height differentials, but that is.

318
00:56:44,225 --> 00:56:44,465
[SPEAKER_15]: that that is.

319
00:56:44,485 --> 00:56:46,006
[SPEAKER_15]: Part of the consideration.

320
00:56:46,206 --> 00:57:01,695
[SPEAKER_15]: There is also the strategy of making the heights lower in order to while I want more height, so therefore I'm going to do the incentives for you the city, which is, I think, partly where you're getting out so we can continue to look at the balance on that.

321
00:57:03,056 --> 00:57:05,737
[SPEAKER_15]: But this was in, uh, you know, in

322
00:57:16,692 --> 00:57:17,953
[SPEAKER_17]: Great, thank you for that explanation.

323
00:57:17,973 --> 00:57:20,655
[SPEAKER_17]: That's interesting.

324
00:57:21,336 --> 00:57:28,862
[SPEAKER_17]: And it's good to know that these are getting re-evaluated and re-tailored as we go along and get more information.

325
00:57:28,882 --> 00:57:32,365
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that sounds well-tailored.

326
00:57:32,385 --> 00:57:33,726
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this makes sense.

327
00:57:39,117 --> 00:57:39,757
[SPEAKER_17]: One quick question.

328
00:57:39,797 --> 00:57:45,598
[SPEAKER_17]: It sounds like the development, well, it seems very clear to me that the development standards are an in progress thing.

329
00:57:46,338 --> 00:57:48,059
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll be hearing more about that in future meetings.

330
00:57:48,919 --> 00:57:58,441
[SPEAKER_17]: Would those, the development standards that you brought forward tonight, do you anticipate those being specific to Medford Square?

331
00:57:58,501 --> 00:58:05,022
[SPEAKER_17]: I assume that's going to be kind of a mix of citywide standards and standards that are tailored to different geographies.

332
00:58:06,958 --> 00:58:08,199
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, absolutely.

333
00:58:08,380 --> 00:58:24,653
[SPEAKER_15]: So that was one of the discussions we'd had partway through this process is that we were recognizing what you just said that a lot of the standards should be consistent throughout the city and that some of them should be very specific to different neighborhoods.

334
00:58:26,014 --> 00:58:30,817
[SPEAKER_15]: We have brought forward just so that people can see them with this zoning.

335
00:58:31,617 --> 00:58:42,164
[SPEAKER_15]: They're primarily the standards that we use in the Salem Street neighborhood quarter we've already identified internally some things that should change specifically for Medford Square.

336
00:58:42,824 --> 00:58:48,948
[SPEAKER_15]: But what we're looking to do is to move all of the standards to a different part of the zoning ordinance and then point.

337
00:58:49,908 --> 00:58:55,451
[SPEAKER_15]: the each individual district to the standards and then put the variations within that.

338
00:58:55,571 --> 00:59:00,273
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's just to avoid acres of repetition in your zoning ordinance at the end.

339
00:59:00,453 --> 00:59:03,895
[SPEAKER_15]: So we've decided we're going to start doing this with this one.

340
00:59:04,476 --> 00:59:09,758
[SPEAKER_15]: But it makes sense to at least keep the language together as people are reviewing the drafts at this point.

341
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:12,139
[SPEAKER_15]: That's great.

342
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:13,060
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

343
00:59:16,635 --> 00:59:23,619
[SPEAKER_17]: Any further questions, comments, concerns from Councilors at this time on the Medford Square zoning proposal?

344
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:29,984
[SPEAKER_17]: And just to recap, later in the meeting, very soon in the meeting, we will be going over West Medford Square as well.

345
00:59:30,024 --> 00:59:33,806
[SPEAKER_17]: And then again, promoting the upcoming zoning meetings and Q&As after this one.

346
00:59:35,991 --> 00:59:38,573
[SPEAKER_17]: Check on seeing no hands in the chambers, I'll check on Zoom.

347
00:59:39,914 --> 00:59:44,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Seeing no hands from Councilors, we're gonna go to public participation.

348
00:59:46,199 --> 00:59:51,843
[SPEAKER_17]: For this item, you may speak up at the podium or on Zoom.

349
00:59:52,443 --> 00:59:57,087
[SPEAKER_17]: Please feel free to line up behind the microphone if you are in person or just raise your hand on Zoom.

350
00:59:57,607 --> 01:00:00,109
[SPEAKER_17]: Every participant will be asked to give their name and address for the record.

351
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:02,151
[SPEAKER_17]: And I will set a timer for three minutes.

352
01:00:03,677 --> 01:00:07,880
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, seeing nobody at the podium, I will go to Zoom first.

353
01:00:09,281 --> 01:00:11,403
[SPEAKER_17]: Cheryl, name and address for the record, please.

354
01:00:11,443 --> 01:00:12,283
[SPEAKER_17]: You have three minutes.

355
01:00:14,765 --> 01:00:17,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

356
01:00:17,827 --> 01:00:24,512
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just looking at this proposal, and I see the mixed-use one has been changed to four stories by right and one incentive floor.

357
01:00:25,012 --> 01:00:29,275
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems that upzoning is happening on Salem Street again.

358
01:00:29,676 --> 01:00:31,497
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not really being pointed out.

359
01:00:31,517 --> 01:00:32,618
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to verify

360
01:00:33,430 --> 01:00:35,631
[SPEAKER_01]: Salem Street is being upzoned by this change.

361
01:00:36,211 --> 01:00:51,038
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my other point was, why are the large lots on High Street on the north side, just outside the square set at NR2, they have more access than Salem Street and somehow are the second lowest neighborhood density.

362
01:00:51,598 --> 01:00:54,159
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't seem like this is consistent and equitable.

363
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:59,942
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you say it won't happen right away and nothing had changed when Salem Street asked for release.

364
01:01:00,430 --> 01:01:08,432
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't really seem appropriate to zone so much lower in areas that have much larger lots and are in the square.

365
01:01:08,452 --> 01:01:18,254
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

366
01:01:18,314 --> 01:01:19,414
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for your comment, Cheryl.

367
01:01:21,575 --> 01:01:23,135
[SPEAKER_17]: Do we have any Director Spicey?

368
01:01:25,376 --> 01:01:25,616
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

369
01:01:26,836 --> 01:01:27,276
[SPEAKER_17]: Good idea.

370
01:01:27,416 --> 01:01:29,977
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll finish public comment and then we'll respond and then move on.

371
01:01:31,612 --> 01:01:37,295
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam chair, sorry, just because there was a complete misunderstanding of something rather than.

372
01:01:37,315 --> 01:01:40,196
[SPEAKER_13]: I just sure.

373
01:01:40,256 --> 01:01:40,497
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.

374
01:01:40,557 --> 01:01:45,659
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm very concerned that there was a complete misunderstanding misinterpretation of what was presented.

375
01:01:47,961 --> 01:01:48,221
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

376
01:01:48,241 --> 01:01:51,865
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll go to Emily and then we'll go back to public participation.

377
01:01:52,986 --> 01:02:03,235
[SPEAKER_15]: So I will answer the first part, which is the change to the mixed use one is simply for Medford Square and West Medford Square.

378
01:02:03,375 --> 01:02:07,519
[SPEAKER_15]: So the Salem Street neighborhood quarter has already been passed.

379
01:02:07,579 --> 01:02:09,040
[SPEAKER_15]: There's no change for that.

380
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:10,061
[SPEAKER_15]: This is the idea.

381
01:02:12,463 --> 01:02:28,973
[SPEAKER_15]: I think we were talking about it in terms of development standards earlier, but the, the districts have the same names, but some of the dimensional standards will also vary by the neighborhood quarter, or square.

382
01:02:29,393 --> 01:02:37,058
[SPEAKER_15]: So in this case the changes that we're proposing for Medford Square and West Medford Square, do not affect the two districts that have already been passed.

383
01:02:38,224 --> 01:02:38,904
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Emily.

384
01:02:38,984 --> 01:02:51,851
[SPEAKER_17]: And it occurs to me that it's not intuitive when you just look at the map as it is when you're reading the zoning code tip to tail, which I encourage people to do if they have the attention span and patience.

385
01:02:53,072 --> 01:02:59,396
[SPEAKER_17]: But the way that the zoning is written into the zoning ordinance is by district.

386
01:02:59,536 --> 01:03:03,338
[SPEAKER_17]: So I can understand how the misunderstanding

387
01:03:03,978 --> 01:03:09,181
[SPEAKER_17]: would occur, and it's like mixed use two is here, mixed use two here, surely they are the same, but they're not.

388
01:03:10,241 --> 01:03:14,843
[SPEAKER_17]: These standards and rules and what these terms mean is defined by district.

389
01:03:15,864 --> 01:03:17,145
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for that clarification.

390
01:03:17,165 --> 01:03:20,966
[SPEAKER_17]: I will go to President Bears and then we'll go back to public participation.

391
01:03:22,387 --> 01:03:23,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I just think it's worth

392
01:03:25,106 --> 01:03:30,789
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking about a naming convention that doesn't use the same words to mean different things in different districts.

393
01:03:30,849 --> 01:03:32,350
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know exactly how we would do that.

394
01:03:32,490 --> 01:03:35,471
[SPEAKER_02]: But, oh, sorry.

395
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:48,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying I think it would be worth trying to consider a naming convention that doesn't use the same words to mean different things in different parts of the city, because I think that's something we're trying to get away from.

396
01:03:52,063 --> 01:04:08,650
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what that naming convention would be, but I do think it raises a point that if you're looking at the map, I just think it's gonna make it hard for the map to be intuitive to the average person looking at it.

397
01:04:10,731 --> 01:04:11,051
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

398
01:04:11,071 --> 01:04:12,631
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's a good point back to you, Emily.

399
01:04:17,993 --> 01:04:18,214
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry.

400
01:04:20,674 --> 01:04:22,614
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, press the button the wrong way.

401
01:04:23,255 --> 01:04:30,056
[SPEAKER_15]: Councilor bears, we can certainly consider that there was there was a reason to have the same names be throughout the district.

402
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:35,197
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think once the map is complete, that reason will look more clear.

403
01:04:37,218 --> 01:04:41,999
[SPEAKER_15]: But we can, you know, if it continues to cause confusion, of course, we can reconsider that.

404
01:04:42,019 --> 01:04:46,200
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Emily.

405
01:04:48,453 --> 01:04:50,554
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, we'll go back to Zoom.

406
01:04:51,694 --> 01:04:53,735
[SPEAKER_17]: Daniel, name and address for the record.

407
01:04:54,236 --> 01:04:55,136
[SPEAKER_17]: You will have three minutes.

408
01:04:58,778 --> 01:05:00,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Daniel Murdoch, 43 Dearborn Street.

409
01:05:01,059 --> 01:05:04,020
[SPEAKER_03]: First, I want to thank everybody for their efforts on this front.

410
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:11,883
[SPEAKER_03]: As proposed today, I strongly support the zoning along I-93 directly east of Medford City Hall being MX3.

411
01:05:13,572 --> 01:05:19,473
[SPEAKER_03]: I also strongly support the slight upzoning of each of the mixed-use categories which was proposed tonight.

412
01:05:20,754 --> 01:05:32,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Given the proposed density in Medford Square, I also strongly support prior resident comments to upzone properties close to but outside the formal boundaries of Medford Square.

413
01:05:33,296 --> 01:05:39,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Specifically, I propose that properties within maybe one or two blocks of the formal boundaries be upzoned from

414
01:05:40,078 --> 01:05:44,419
[SPEAKER_03]: NR2 or NR3, maybe up to Urban Residential 1 or 2.

415
01:05:45,179 --> 01:05:49,980
[SPEAKER_03]: This change would provide some additional needed density to support commercial properties within the squares.

416
01:05:50,681 --> 01:06:00,023
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition, it may provide a more gradual transition from the density permitted under the mixed use categories to the lower density categories of neighbor residential.

417
01:06:00,683 --> 01:06:09,205
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, the transition seems fairly large, but maybe upzoning to Urban Residential 1 or 2 could serve as an effective transition.

418
01:06:10,208 --> 01:06:17,432
[SPEAKER_03]: I also strongly support providing additional flexibility on the number of floors and amount of space available for commercial use in mixed-use zones.

419
01:06:18,493 --> 01:06:33,262
[SPEAKER_03]: Limiting commercial use to a single floor may severely limit potential business interest, and depending on the height of the mixed-use development proposed, it may be valuable to allow for flexibility for maybe two or even three floors of commercial space.

420
01:06:34,443 --> 01:06:44,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I also strongly support comments where reasonable to reduce minimum parking requirements and setbacks to ensure that these rezoning efforts are not artificially stimmied in the future.

421
01:06:45,065 --> 01:06:50,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Lastly, I do not support any neighborhood residential three within the Medford Square zone.

422
01:06:51,546 --> 01:06:55,847
[SPEAKER_03]: It is incongruent with residents' desires to increase density and vibrancy in the area.

423
01:06:56,467 --> 01:07:01,568
[SPEAKER_03]: And I suggest that the one section of neighborhood residential three be up-zoned to urban residential one.

424
01:07:02,608 --> 01:07:12,836
[SPEAKER_03]: as I previously noted this way, provide a more step down approach or a better transition from the mixed use zones to the surrounding slightly lower residential areas.

425
01:07:13,237 --> 01:07:13,577
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

426
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:17,640
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for your comments.

427
01:07:22,504 --> 01:07:24,426
[SPEAKER_17]: Go next to Alex.

428
01:07:24,626 --> 01:07:26,107
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

429
01:07:26,387 --> 01:07:27,168
[SPEAKER_17]: You have three minutes.

430
01:07:30,895 --> 01:07:31,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, everyone.

431
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:35,716
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Alex Skiller, 53 Fourth Street, just outside the center.

432
01:07:35,736 --> 01:07:39,137
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really excited at what you guys are proposing.

433
01:07:39,317 --> 01:07:44,138
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it'd be great if we can actually get some height into our commercial district downtown.

434
01:07:45,418 --> 01:07:47,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't been able to follow all of this as closely.

435
01:07:47,438 --> 01:07:49,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I know you guys are putting a lot of time to this.

436
01:07:49,499 --> 01:07:54,960
[SPEAKER_05]: My question is, in terms of the public parking lots, I am on board with

437
01:07:55,536 --> 01:08:00,740
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, in between city hall and 93, but I do think we need to retain some public parking lots.

438
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,883
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, in particular, I mean, on forestry, I live right across the street from the theater.

439
01:08:06,443 --> 01:08:12,167
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had a long battle, uh, with people parking illegally constantly on forest street for many years.

440
01:08:12,227 --> 01:08:17,671
[SPEAKER_05]: We finally have gotten control of it, uh, after many headaches and a long process.

441
01:08:18,171 --> 01:08:23,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and one of the areas that they park the most are the area between Riverside

442
01:08:24,642 --> 01:08:27,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Clippership, City Hall, that whole area.

443
01:08:27,103 --> 01:08:40,451
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we all do believe that the Chevalier Theater is a huge beneficial contributor to all of our restaurants, all of our shops on any given night throughout the year.

444
01:08:40,551 --> 01:08:51,998
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I would hate to see is aggravation caused within the community because all of that parking is now being dispersed throughout the city, or for that matter, people are not gonna be going

445
01:08:52,934 --> 01:08:57,156
[SPEAKER_05]: to Chevalier as often as they used to, because it is not easy to park.

446
01:08:57,176 --> 01:09:06,220
[SPEAKER_05]: Because some people, as is, already are frustrated that there's not parking right at the building, which is a little ridiculous, because there is plenty of parking over on Riverside.

447
01:09:06,280 --> 01:09:10,322
[SPEAKER_05]: But is there a plan for those parking lots as of right now?

448
01:09:11,742 --> 01:09:12,082
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

449
01:09:14,904 --> 01:09:15,104
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

450
01:09:15,164 --> 01:09:16,504
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much for your comments.

451
01:09:19,872 --> 01:09:33,480
[SPEAKER_17]: The topic of parking within the square has definitely been enthusiastically discussed during this process and I think the I think everybody's on board that we it's not tenable to see parking disappear from the square we want people to.

452
01:09:34,541 --> 01:09:39,167
[SPEAKER_17]: be able to drive in and patronize our businesses and everything else.

453
01:09:39,208 --> 01:09:40,169
[SPEAKER_17]: Some people need to drive.

454
01:09:40,189 --> 01:09:41,050
[SPEAKER_17]: That's perfectly fine.

455
01:09:42,272 --> 01:09:47,359
[SPEAKER_17]: We've discussed a mix of strategies, including kind of on the private side.

456
01:09:47,379 --> 01:09:51,444
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the city is looking at parking lot development

457
01:09:52,446 --> 01:10:07,459
[SPEAKER_17]: And within the scope of zoning, we've had a lot of discussions about how this zoning would allow us to retain public parking, but on the footprint of lots so rather than taking up ground space that could be activated how it could be folded into the envelope of buildings.

458
01:10:07,799 --> 01:10:13,204
[SPEAKER_17]: And I will pass the mic to President Bears will probably have more to say about that.

459
01:10:14,065 --> 01:10:14,825
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there more comments.

460
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:15,706
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

461
01:10:16,126 --> 01:10:16,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

462
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:29,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for the comment, and I think this is a really good question to illustrate what happens through zoning and what happens through other processes.

463
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:40,966
[SPEAKER_02]: So the zoning for the lots between City Hall and the highway and the lots south of City Hall

464
01:10:43,343 --> 01:10:45,945
[SPEAKER_02]: we're going to, you know, there's going to be a zone there.

465
01:10:45,965 --> 01:10:53,349
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to indicate what the property owner could conceivably build based on the zoning code.

466
01:10:53,489 --> 01:10:55,871
[SPEAKER_02]: But in this case, the property owner is the city of Medford.

467
01:10:56,411 --> 01:10:59,933
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're currently going through a process.

468
01:11:00,273 --> 01:11:07,198
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a request for proposals for redevelopment of the city owned lots surrounding City Hall.

469
01:11:07,798 --> 01:11:10,580
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's information about that on the city website.

470
01:11:11,993 --> 01:11:21,700
[SPEAKER_02]: And more information to come from that, but definitely one of the main considerations was what does the parking demand for the square look like?

471
01:11:22,181 --> 01:11:24,382
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do these lots play into that?

472
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:31,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly, you know, there are a number of parking related factors included in the RFP, and that would be included in

473
01:11:33,085 --> 01:11:42,393
[SPEAKER_02]: any award to anyone who submitted a proposal to work with the city for redevelopment, such as the senior center parking, it was mandated that that be preserved.

474
01:11:43,674 --> 01:11:52,522
[SPEAKER_02]: And looking at the parking needs related to Chevalier and also related to new construction.

475
01:11:52,762 --> 01:11:58,507
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but that's actually going to happen in this case through the city working with

476
01:12:00,227 --> 01:12:03,309
[SPEAKER_02]: a group to do that redevelopment.

477
01:12:03,910 --> 01:12:16,958
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, for example, if there was a redevelopment by a private owner of private lots, parking would be discussed through the site plan review process through the Community Development Board.

478
01:12:16,978 --> 01:12:27,785
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's just a great way to show that, you know, the zoning is one piece of the larger puzzle around what our city and community looks like.

479
01:12:28,856 --> 01:12:43,063
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are other processes where the actual specifics of what's getting built, where, where is the parking, how many units, you know, there's so much more public process that happens after zoning is passed before anything gets built.

480
01:12:44,584 --> 01:12:48,406
[SPEAKER_02]: All that to say, in this specific case, the city's already doing that work.

481
01:12:49,006 --> 01:12:52,248
[SPEAKER_02]: And parking has been a major part of that discussion.

482
01:12:53,888 --> 01:13:06,794
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll throw in my two cents on it, which is I would love for us to try to figure out how to better utilize the large and mostly empty Atrius Health parking lot that already exists right across the street from City Hall.

483
01:13:06,894 --> 01:13:12,337
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hopeful that we can do that as part of this process that the city's working through.

484
01:13:13,037 --> 01:13:13,318
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

485
01:13:16,627 --> 01:13:16,867
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

486
01:13:17,847 --> 01:13:19,168
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you to all commenters.

487
01:13:19,608 --> 01:13:21,969
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you President Bears for fielding that comment.

488
01:13:27,211 --> 01:13:27,891
[SPEAKER_17]: I know we've got to move on.

489
01:13:27,931 --> 01:13:40,496
[SPEAKER_17]: I know we're short on time, but I did want to pick up on, is there a short refresher on why those residential parcels in the square are NR3 and not UR1?

490
01:13:49,915 --> 01:13:50,315
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes.

491
01:13:51,255 --> 01:14:01,278
[SPEAKER_15]: And you also give me the opportunity to mention something else that we're working on that we don't want to lose so in that case, it's topographical changes in terms of.

492
01:14:03,039 --> 01:14:18,444
[SPEAKER_15]: We tried to think when we've been throughout all of this when we've been looking at the neighborhood residential components, which include the right neighborhood residential districts and the urban residential districts I know that's a topic that's before the CD board next week but obviously it has.

493
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:24,054
[SPEAKER_15]: implications for what we're doing here today.

494
01:14:24,134 --> 01:14:33,640
[SPEAKER_15]: So I will mention that we have been looking at a number of neighborhood characteristics to inform how we designate one area versus another.

495
01:14:34,860 --> 01:14:39,863
[SPEAKER_15]: So that is a component of what's there now.

496
01:14:39,943 --> 01:14:44,906
[SPEAKER_15]: And also the topographical changes are understanding from people who have spoken before that it's quite steep.

497
01:14:45,886 --> 01:14:46,847
[SPEAKER_15]: The roads are difficult.

498
01:14:47,647 --> 01:15:03,958
[SPEAKER_15]: The part that I want to mention is that we are working on an online interactive map now that we will introduce at the city board meeting next week that will allow people to look up specific properties of their own, another one that they know about.

499
01:15:04,998 --> 01:15:15,085
[SPEAKER_15]: and compare the characteristics of the area and understand maybe a little bit better why we're suggesting some of the things that we are suggesting.

500
01:15:16,906 --> 01:15:20,629
[SPEAKER_15]: That will include the slope measurements, among other things.

501
01:15:20,989 --> 01:15:23,791
[SPEAKER_15]: It would also include the public private roads that we've talked about.

502
01:15:24,691 --> 01:15:27,412
[SPEAKER_15]: at previous meetings and some of the other characteristics.

503
01:15:27,553 --> 01:15:39,518
[SPEAKER_15]: So we hope that that will be a tool that can better inform all of us, us as well as yourselves, the city councillors, and the many people who are participating in this process.

504
01:15:43,940 --> 01:15:45,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Great, thank you so much.

505
01:15:45,241 --> 01:15:45,961
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, Paula, go ahead.

506
01:15:47,758 --> 01:15:58,141
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, we also had the question about the ground floor commercial by Daniel Morduck.

507
01:15:59,362 --> 01:16:06,564
[SPEAKER_12]: We are not, I know that in the sections we sometimes show one or two ground floor commercial.

508
01:16:08,324 --> 01:16:09,845
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have any limitation.

509
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:16,301
[SPEAKER_12]: So it can be, uh, any floor they consider the development that it's needed.

510
01:16:16,941 --> 01:16:19,161
[SPEAKER_12]: So we're not limiting that to the ground floor.

511
01:16:19,381 --> 01:16:20,802
[SPEAKER_12]: Just wanted to clarify that.

512
01:16:24,003 --> 01:16:24,223
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

513
01:16:24,963 --> 01:16:25,523
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much.

514
01:16:28,444 --> 01:16:28,784
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

515
01:16:28,924 --> 01:16:33,805
[SPEAKER_17]: Any more comments on Medford Square from Councilors before we move on to, uh, our

516
01:16:36,987 --> 01:16:38,869
[SPEAKER_17]: quick and efficient discussion of West Medford Square.

517
01:16:38,889 --> 01:16:40,911
[SPEAKER_17]: I apologize to people who are here for the 7 p.m.

518
01:16:41,692 --> 01:16:44,154
[SPEAKER_17]: My apologies, we got started late.

519
01:16:45,496 --> 01:16:47,337
[SPEAKER_17]: Seeing none, on we go.

520
01:16:47,357 --> 01:16:48,959
[SPEAKER_17]: I apologize for the pace tonight, everybody.

521
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:55,085
[SPEAKER_15]: I will just say, Councilor, that it is we who should apologize, not yourselves.

522
01:16:55,285 --> 01:16:56,547
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm going to pass it back.

523
01:17:02,685 --> 01:17:03,287
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll go to.

524
01:17:03,607 --> 01:17:07,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to apologize.

525
01:17:08,197 --> 01:17:09,079
[SPEAKER_02]: We take as long as we need.

526
01:17:09,099 --> 01:17:09,980
[SPEAKER_02]: We shouldn't rush anything.

527
01:17:10,786 --> 01:17:17,650
[SPEAKER_02]: The purpose of scheduling the 7pm is that if we had finished by 7pm, we could start the next meeting at 7pm, because you can't backdate a notice.

528
01:17:17,690 --> 01:17:22,073
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we had said eight o'clock, and we'd finished at 730, everyone would have been waiting around for 30 minutes.

529
01:17:22,614 --> 01:17:28,437
[SPEAKER_02]: But the purpose of the back to back six to seven is that if the if this meeting needs to continue, it can go as long as it needs to go.

530
01:17:28,938 --> 01:17:30,218
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can start the next meeting.

531
01:17:30,418 --> 01:17:35,442
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just want everyone to, you know, we're, we're gonna take this deliberately.

532
01:17:35,702 --> 01:17:35,822
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

533
01:17:38,647 --> 01:17:39,868
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe, yeah, we should.

534
01:17:40,608 --> 01:17:42,709
[SPEAKER_02]: We should do everything that's on the presentation.

535
01:17:42,729 --> 01:17:43,830
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we'll go through the whole agenda.

536
01:17:44,090 --> 01:17:44,250
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

537
01:17:44,890 --> 01:17:47,491
[SPEAKER_17]: I was just, I didn't want to, I was feeling bad for maybe stressing people out.

538
01:17:47,551 --> 01:17:48,952
[SPEAKER_17]: So I rescind my apology.

539
01:17:49,292 --> 01:17:50,433
[SPEAKER_17]: You rescind your apology.

540
01:17:50,793 --> 01:17:52,214
[SPEAKER_17]: Nobody apologizes for everything.

541
01:17:52,874 --> 01:17:53,754
[SPEAKER_17]: Zoning is complicated.

542
01:17:53,774 --> 01:17:54,735
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll take the time that we need.

543
01:17:54,775 --> 01:17:56,276
[SPEAKER_17]: And thank you, department heads for being here.

544
01:17:58,977 --> 01:17:59,197
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

545
01:17:59,477 --> 01:18:01,858
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, apologies having been rescinded.

546
01:18:02,198 --> 01:18:04,920
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's go back to the presentation for West Medford Square.

547
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:05,420
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much.

548
01:18:06,835 --> 01:18:09,057
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam Chair, if I may, thank you very much.

549
01:18:09,077 --> 01:18:12,600
[SPEAKER_12]: I will share again the presentation.

550
01:18:12,620 --> 01:18:12,700
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

551
01:18:17,564 --> 01:18:24,810
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm going to go a little fast on these things that we have already seen in the previous meeting.

552
01:18:25,091 --> 01:18:31,696
[SPEAKER_12]: If anyone is new and wants to look at this again, we can go back and answer all your questions.

553
01:18:33,178 --> 01:18:42,186
[SPEAKER_12]: So this was the proposal one, the first proposal that we did for West Medford Square from the city councilor and the public.

554
01:18:42,707 --> 01:18:51,275
[SPEAKER_12]: We got also if some areas that if we could increase some of these densities in some of these areas.

555
01:18:52,356 --> 01:18:55,438
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have done that.

556
01:18:55,498 --> 01:19:04,385
[SPEAKER_12]: We also have enlarged the boundary of the square to the dotted lines that we had, and also in this area.

557
01:19:04,405 --> 01:19:10,229
[SPEAKER_12]: So the proposal expansion, we have also made it official in the new map.

558
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:21,318
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the areas that, and we have the same lecture as, so the same update with the mixed use one to eight,

559
01:19:21,718 --> 01:19:22,439
[SPEAKER_12]: to be here.

560
01:19:22,479 --> 01:19:25,621
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have mixes three or mixes one.

561
01:19:25,641 --> 01:19:31,426
[SPEAKER_12]: So in to a and to be are going to be the same as in Medford Square.

562
01:19:32,647 --> 01:19:35,129
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so the updated map.

563
01:19:35,169 --> 01:19:37,791
[SPEAKER_12]: We also brought the residential again.

564
01:19:37,851 --> 01:19:38,351
[SPEAKER_12]: This is the

565
01:19:39,192 --> 01:19:40,112
[SPEAKER_12]: we are looking at the.

566
01:19:40,132 --> 01:19:43,513
[SPEAKER_12]: Um latest official version that we have for the residential.

567
01:19:44,033 --> 01:19:47,214
[SPEAKER_12]: We are looking as the in the public meeting.

568
01:19:47,254 --> 01:19:52,756
[SPEAKER_12]: We had comments about more density, etcetera in certain areas.

569
01:19:53,376 --> 01:19:56,817
[SPEAKER_12]: Um we are looking into that with the interactive map as well.

570
01:19:57,237 --> 01:20:00,318
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can comment on that and give us your opinion,

571
01:20:08,540 --> 01:20:11,161
[SPEAKER_12]: So right now, in this area, we have the NR3.

572
01:20:14,682 --> 01:20:23,104
[SPEAKER_12]: So what you see here is that we already made the boundary, taking all the other areas that we were proposing to expand.

573
01:20:24,864 --> 01:20:35,267
[SPEAKER_12]: What we have is in Harvard Avenue, we took the eastern part as a mixed use 2B, and it was 2A before.

574
01:20:36,787 --> 01:20:38,268
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is now 2B.

575
01:20:38,968 --> 01:20:49,050
[SPEAKER_12]: And then there were suggestions from senior planner, Danielle Evans, to include two lots from the St.

576
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:53,191
[SPEAKER_12]: Raphael Parish to also include it into the 2B.

577
01:20:58,092 --> 01:20:59,033
[SPEAKER_12]: So they are included.

578
01:20:59,053 --> 01:21:05,517
[SPEAKER_12]: And we will maintain those two A when we are going into the neighborhood.

579
01:21:05,917 --> 01:21:09,860
[SPEAKER_12]: So there is a nicer transition toward the residential buildings.

580
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:22,248
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, here we have the same standards, development standards that we are proposing with the abutting residential districts or the minimum daylight standard.

581
01:21:22,309 --> 01:21:25,531
[SPEAKER_12]: So those will be proposed as well for West Medford.

582
01:21:26,251 --> 01:21:34,854
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, and then when you see this dashed lines, we are going to look into these areas, these neighborhood quarters.

583
01:21:35,214 --> 01:21:43,077
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, it was commented about the connection to Arlington center being very, very close by.

584
01:21:43,598 --> 01:21:48,579
[SPEAKER_12]: And so there are some business, not a lot, but there are some buildings that already are commercial.

585
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:55,262
[SPEAKER_12]: So the suggestion was, could we have some kind of, uh, quarter, smaller, smaller scale quarter

586
01:21:55,983 --> 01:22:05,337
[SPEAKER_12]: towards Arlington, and then some more residential corridor that could have a higher density maybe urban to exactly along the.

587
01:22:06,839 --> 01:22:07,119
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry.

588
01:22:08,642 --> 01:22:09,663
[SPEAKER_12]: This is Boston Avenue.

589
01:22:09,864 --> 01:22:10,284
[SPEAKER_12]: Am I correct.

590
01:22:11,005 --> 01:22:11,326
[SPEAKER_12]: This one.

591
01:22:12,502 --> 01:22:14,183
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, Boston Avenue.

592
01:22:14,603 --> 01:22:18,845
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we could up-zone also these ones to UR2.

593
01:22:19,165 --> 01:22:21,266
[SPEAKER_12]: So those are two things that we are still looking at.

594
01:22:22,426 --> 01:22:32,450
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have it here because that is outside the scope of West Medford Square, but we will bring them when we will look in the next meeting into the other corridors.

595
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:36,552
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to mention that we are looking into that and working with that.

596
01:22:37,672 --> 01:22:37,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Um.

597
01:22:38,772 --> 01:22:44,434
[SPEAKER_12]: We also have here in Canal Street since it also goes back to the trail, uh, tracks.

598
01:22:45,154 --> 01:22:54,276
[SPEAKER_12]: Um that we are also looking into up zone this area from to a as we had before, uh, into to be so that is more continuous.

599
01:22:55,436 --> 01:22:55,656
[SPEAKER_12]: Um.

600
01:22:56,836 --> 01:22:57,736
[SPEAKER_12]: And those are the

601
01:23:05,218 --> 01:23:18,753
[SPEAKER_12]: In our language we will include them as an incentive zoning especially and very specific for this area, the commuter rail access, so that public access from High Street.

602
01:23:20,515 --> 01:23:36,339
[SPEAKER_12]: So use this lots to be able to access the entrance to the commuter rail through the building and also to include some public parking in this area for the commuter users.

603
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:40,500
[SPEAKER_12]: So those things we also discussed.

604
01:23:40,540 --> 01:23:41,800
[SPEAKER_12]: We don't have the exact language.

605
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:45,861
[SPEAKER_12]: We're looking into other examples in a regional level and national level.

606
01:23:46,341 --> 01:23:49,382
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that we can take that language and apply it in here.

607
01:23:51,287 --> 01:23:53,416
[SPEAKER_12]: So that will come as well into the language.

608
01:23:57,765 --> 01:23:59,946
[SPEAKER_17]: Great, thank you so much for this overview.

609
01:23:59,966 --> 01:24:08,568
[SPEAKER_17]: This is exciting to see our first meeting looking closely at the West Medford Square zoning map.

610
01:24:08,888 --> 01:24:11,928
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that was the one that was three weeks ago, I believe.

611
01:24:12,028 --> 01:24:12,729
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been a long month.

612
01:24:12,749 --> 01:24:15,369
[SPEAKER_17]: It was an exciting meeting.

613
01:24:15,409 --> 01:24:17,270
[SPEAKER_17]: We had so much community feedback.

614
01:24:17,790 --> 01:24:25,171
[SPEAKER_17]: As one resident, as one Councilor, I'm really excited by the vision for West Medford Square that we see in this map.

615
01:24:26,312 --> 01:24:27,332
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that this will

616
01:24:28,553 --> 01:24:28,693
[SPEAKER_17]: that.

617
01:24:28,713 --> 01:24:34,197
[SPEAKER_17]: Incentivize enable and encourage a lot of the vibrancy and activity and business development.

618
01:24:35,017 --> 01:24:35,197
[SPEAKER_17]: Um.

619
01:24:35,998 --> 01:24:43,743
[SPEAKER_17]: That people already celebrate in West Medford Square and want to see more of and enable the, uh, housing units that will make that.

620
01:24:50,548 --> 01:24:55,912
[SPEAKER_17]: As you went over, just the couple color changes, as I'll call them, the St.

621
01:24:55,952 --> 01:25:01,496
[SPEAKER_17]: Raphael's owned lots have been combined into the same zoning subdistrict, which makes sense.

622
01:25:01,576 --> 01:25:09,502
[SPEAKER_17]: And I do see it's like a really small triangle between the rail and Canal Street that's been flipped from MX2A to MX2B.

623
01:25:09,562 --> 01:25:10,223
[SPEAKER_17]: That makes sense.

624
01:25:12,044 --> 01:25:19,670
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, again, a lot of our conversation at the first committee meeting centered around, you know,

625
01:25:20,668 --> 01:25:25,992
[SPEAKER_17]: The way that I put it, and other people put it differently, was what should the default zoning be for this square?

626
01:25:26,132 --> 01:25:28,533
[SPEAKER_17]: My opinion was it should be MX2B.

627
01:25:28,573 --> 01:25:34,958
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's the site that makes sense to apply to most of the land area.

628
01:25:35,638 --> 01:25:45,725
[SPEAKER_17]: So here we see those kind of minor additions of MX2B, but I see that the changes to by right heights have been adjusted for West Medford Square, as they have been for Medford Square.

629
01:25:45,745 --> 01:25:49,568
[SPEAKER_17]: So just to reiterate, that's not a change, like we just talked about, it's not a change to what those mean.

630
01:25:50,168 --> 01:25:52,471
[SPEAKER_17]: Citywide, it's a change to what they mean in the squares.

631
01:25:53,472 --> 01:25:59,739
[SPEAKER_17]: So in Mixed Use 2A, it's now five stories by right with two incentive above if incentive zoning applies.

632
01:26:00,881 --> 01:26:09,131
[SPEAKER_17]: In Mixed Use 2B, it's seven stories by right plus two incentive zoning stories above if developers seek and achieve incentive zoning.

633
01:26:10,871 --> 01:26:11,631
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that makes sense.

634
01:26:12,532 --> 01:26:22,573
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that having the residential only zoning in the square be your urban residential too makes a lot of sense because of the specific area and its amenities.

635
01:26:24,834 --> 01:26:27,634
[SPEAKER_17]: So that's just my note of enthusiasm to start off the discussion with.

636
01:26:28,594 --> 01:26:34,796
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there any initial comments and questions from Councilors on this proposal?

637
01:26:36,256 --> 01:26:36,696
[SPEAKER_17]: President Bears.

638
01:26:38,013 --> 01:26:45,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have sections, Paula and Emily for this, or could you just reiterate the development standards piece again and how that would integrate with the zoning.

639
01:26:52,690 --> 01:26:53,270
[SPEAKER_02]: So like that.

640
01:26:53,430 --> 01:26:55,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I guess my point being that like the by right.

641
01:26:57,261 --> 01:27:02,822
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not just gonna be able to put 100% lot coverage, seven-story building by right on these lots.

642
01:27:03,522 --> 01:27:11,884
[SPEAKER_02]: There's gonna be dimensional standards, development standards, parking requirements that are going to impact what is actually buildable on each of these lots.

643
01:27:13,404 --> 01:27:26,207
[SPEAKER_02]: And given the odd lot shapes, lot sizes, probably significant lack of ability to combine existing lots, existing, you know, you have two,

644
01:27:27,544 --> 01:27:37,927
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, two of the most significant areas are owned by nonprofit religious organizations and institutions, you're not actually going to see, you know, St.

645
01:27:37,967 --> 01:27:40,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Ray's get replaced by a seven plus two.

646
01:27:41,008 --> 01:27:50,470
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just think it's important, again, to reiterate how zoning fits into the larger context of construction and development processes.

647
01:27:52,711 --> 01:27:56,372
[SPEAKER_02]: My point being, you know, if you're on

648
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:14,047
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're looking at the large lots on on circuit or Bauer, there's going to be some limitations based on the development standards and the width of the street and the sunlight and the light.

649
01:28:14,427 --> 01:28:22,010
[SPEAKER_02]: That means you're not going to see, you know, it's probably going to be three, four or five story building, which I think is great.

650
01:28:23,067 --> 01:28:29,449
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they could make it stylish and make it fit the daylight to have a piece of that be seven stories, I think that's great.

651
01:28:29,469 --> 01:28:30,389
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just think it's important.

652
01:28:30,409 --> 01:28:38,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people see this map and they say, okay, you know, you start to say this is what is this going to look like?

653
01:28:38,871 --> 01:28:50,174
[SPEAKER_02]: What is this actually going to look like versus how it integrates with actually the full written text of the zoning and what's possible given the size of the lots and the development standards that are being incorporated.

654
01:28:52,227 --> 01:28:55,938
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was more of a comment, but I think also a jumping off point at least.

655
01:28:59,490 --> 01:28:59,790
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

656
01:28:59,910 --> 01:29:25,857
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, thank you, President Bears, I think I want to emphasize something that you said that I think it's, I agree with you is critically important that people understand which is the height limitations are relaxed in this so you're basically you're no longer using height as a sole limitation, but there are other limitations, there are the other dimensional standards that come into play.

657
01:29:26,537 --> 01:29:36,487
[SPEAKER_15]: I think these, the, the ones that Paul mentioned earlier for sunlight and shadow, those are going to have a significant impact on what can be built.

658
01:29:37,048 --> 01:29:44,475
[SPEAKER_15]: And then there are those factors that are simply beyond zoning that that factor into development that I think we've talked about in the past.

659
01:29:45,536 --> 01:29:47,297
[SPEAKER_15]: and vary by economic cycle.

660
01:29:47,418 --> 01:29:58,886
[SPEAKER_15]: But the important bit is that although we've been talking about height as a differentiating factor between zoning districts, there are in fact other limiting factors within that.

661
01:30:05,571 --> 01:30:06,031
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for that.

662
01:30:06,051 --> 01:30:08,053
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's a really important

663
01:30:09,558 --> 01:30:26,392
[SPEAKER_17]: thing to emphasize, probably every time we have this conversation, we talk about, it's one thing to talk about the potential, and another to talk about what that, how that potential is bounded by reality.

664
01:30:28,714 --> 01:30:31,376
[SPEAKER_17]: Obviously, that's zoning, but I appreciate that we can talk about it.

665
01:30:31,657 --> 01:30:35,820
[SPEAKER_17]: It's important to have the discussion about what we want that maximum potential to be in the specific neighborhood.

666
01:30:38,502 --> 01:30:44,553
[SPEAKER_17]: and then make some more tailored predictions based on the actual on-the-ground context.

667
01:30:47,834 --> 01:30:48,134
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

668
01:30:48,214 --> 01:31:04,387
[SPEAKER_17]: And just to reiterate what Paola said in the presentation, there was a lot of commentary at our first committee meeting about the High Street corridor leading down to Arlington and the activation of the Boston Avenue corridor on the West Medford Square side of the river.

669
01:31:05,768 --> 01:31:10,071
[SPEAKER_17]: So I heard that those will be topics that we'll dive deeper into at our next committee meeting.

670
01:31:10,091 --> 01:31:11,693
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll be talking about other corridors.

671
01:31:13,274 --> 01:31:15,856
[SPEAKER_17]: So stay tuned to everybody who advocated passionately for that.

672
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:23,864
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there any other comments or questions from councillors on this proposal or from city staff?

673
01:31:28,467 --> 01:31:33,870
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, seeing none, we will go to public participation for this topic.

674
01:31:37,192 --> 01:31:37,973
[SPEAKER_17]: As I said before,

675
01:31:39,586 --> 01:31:41,947
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody will say their name and address for the record.

676
01:31:42,327 --> 01:31:49,852
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody will have three minutes, I will set a timer, and we will go to the podium first once the microphone makes its way back.

677
01:31:49,872 --> 01:31:57,376
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, one second.

678
01:31:59,437 --> 01:32:01,318
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, go ahead, name and address for the record, please.

679
01:32:01,518 --> 01:32:02,178
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

680
01:32:02,678 --> 01:32:04,199
[SPEAKER_10]: Gaston Fierro, 61 Stingley Road.

681
01:32:04,219 --> 01:32:05,540
[SPEAKER_10]: I just was wondering about

682
01:32:06,867 --> 01:32:15,892
[SPEAKER_10]: We had a conversation last time about the triangle to the south of West Medford Square, bordering the Mystic River on the north.

683
01:32:16,632 --> 01:32:30,580
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that there was some discussion last time that we covered this on including it within West Medford Square, and I was just wondering whether that has been evaluated, and if so, what was the decision to leave it outside of it?

684
01:32:30,940 --> 01:32:31,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you so much.

685
01:32:42,637 --> 01:32:53,844
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, maybe we misunderstood, but I thought that in that meeting there was clear that there was not a lot of fire safety.

686
01:32:54,464 --> 01:32:58,367
[SPEAKER_12]: You talked about that being a problem in that area to be reached.

687
01:32:59,808 --> 01:33:02,609
[SPEAKER_12]: So there were some problems with that, so we didn't include it.

688
01:33:07,032 --> 01:33:07,252
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

689
01:33:07,272 --> 01:33:08,153
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll go to President Paris.

690
01:33:08,453 --> 01:33:11,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I spoke to that, and I don't know if Director Hunt

691
01:33:12,860 --> 01:33:14,201
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe talk to anybody else about it.

692
01:33:14,261 --> 01:33:17,945
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did receive a couple emails from people who live there.

693
01:33:17,965 --> 01:33:22,289
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know if you guys were going to go back and review it or not.

694
01:33:22,349 --> 01:33:26,813
[SPEAKER_02]: But I personally, just given the conditions there, don't think it should be included.

695
01:33:27,073 --> 01:33:28,575
[SPEAKER_02]: It is really difficult to access.

696
01:33:28,675 --> 01:33:33,619
[SPEAKER_02]: And when there was the fire at the Canal Street,

697
01:33:35,801 --> 01:33:47,327
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's still, you can still see the fire damage when you're coming over the Boston Ave bridge, and there's been a ton of dispute building Commissioner Fire around the reconstruction of that.

698
01:33:47,848 --> 01:33:54,431
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's essentially a dead end street that already has a lot of housing on it.

699
01:33:54,691 --> 01:33:58,854
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that the fire department was concerned with

700
01:34:01,801 --> 01:34:04,883
[SPEAKER_02]: even reconstructing the number of units in that existing structure.

701
01:34:05,263 --> 01:34:11,507
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pre-existing non-conforming structure that maybe had illegal unpermitted work done to it to add illegal units.

702
01:34:11,567 --> 01:34:19,052
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of a complicated situation, but there was a lot of concern about fire safety.

703
01:34:20,813 --> 01:34:27,217
[SPEAKER_02]: And just given for me, given that it's on the other side of the railroad tracks, I think there's a cohesion element as well.

704
01:34:30,048 --> 01:34:31,210
[SPEAKER_17]: Great, thank you for raising that.

705
01:34:31,330 --> 01:34:32,633
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for the explanation.

706
01:34:34,296 --> 01:34:36,901
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, we'll go back to Zoom.

707
01:34:38,303 --> 01:34:40,106
[SPEAKER_17]: Zoe, name and address for the record, please.

708
01:34:40,307 --> 01:34:41,249
[SPEAKER_17]: You will have three minutes.

709
01:34:44,175 --> 01:34:44,735
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

710
01:34:44,975 --> 01:34:47,396
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm Zoe Mutzos, 33 Johnson Ave.

711
01:34:48,436 --> 01:34:50,117
[SPEAKER_16]: I have two questions.

712
01:34:50,277 --> 01:34:53,978
[SPEAKER_16]: I missed the first meeting, so I'm really just trying to understand.

713
01:34:55,598 --> 01:35:06,161
[SPEAKER_16]: So to be sure I'm reading this correctly, if we're looking at High Street at the corner of High and Johnson Ave, that is mixed use.

714
01:35:06,661 --> 01:35:08,882
[SPEAKER_16]: That could be zoned as mixed use 2B.

715
01:35:08,962 --> 01:35:09,662
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that correct?

716
01:35:23,314 --> 01:35:28,697
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, we're getting a yes from people who have every stream approved.

717
01:35:28,717 --> 01:35:28,797
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

718
01:35:28,817 --> 01:35:33,120
[SPEAKER_02]: On the Walgreens side of the street, yeah.

719
01:35:33,140 --> 01:35:36,762
[SPEAKER_16]: Yes, on the Walgreens side of the street, that's where Johnson Ave is.

720
01:35:38,543 --> 01:35:39,383
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep, right there.

721
01:35:40,164 --> 01:35:40,684
[SPEAKER_16]: Right there.

722
01:35:41,524 --> 01:35:44,086
[SPEAKER_16]: That little road right there, I think, is Johnson Ave.

723
01:35:45,255 --> 01:35:53,941
[SPEAKER_16]: And so that little section would be zoned 2B, that section of Johnson Ave.

724
01:35:58,104 --> 01:35:58,745
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, that's correct.

725
01:35:59,262 --> 01:35:59,482
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

726
01:35:59,982 --> 01:36:06,585
[SPEAKER_16]: And then this, the, the blue mixed use to a, oh my God, am I running out of time?

727
01:36:06,725 --> 01:36:07,025
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh God.

728
01:36:07,105 --> 01:36:07,345
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

729
01:36:07,946 --> 01:36:13,528
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, in the Walgreens parking lot along the trail railroad tracks, that's a parking lot right now.

730
01:36:14,208 --> 01:36:17,189
[SPEAKER_16]: Is that like who owns that parking lot?

731
01:36:17,229 --> 01:36:18,350
[SPEAKER_16]: Does Medford own that?

732
01:36:20,791 --> 01:36:20,891
Yeah.

733
01:36:23,272 --> 01:36:27,814
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't worry about the time where, since we're going back and forth here, um, it's, uh,

734
01:36:30,195 --> 01:36:37,019
[SPEAKER_02]: It is actually, I think, is it MBTA owned privately operated or just privately owned?

735
01:36:37,420 --> 01:36:39,361
[SPEAKER_13]: Madam Chair, I looked it up the other week.

736
01:36:39,381 --> 01:36:44,764
[SPEAKER_13]: It's privately owned and it must, parts of it must be leased by the MBTA because they have it.

737
01:36:45,785 --> 01:36:48,706
[SPEAKER_13]: You pay MBTA for parking, but it's a privately owned lot.

738
01:36:49,207 --> 01:36:49,847
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, great.

739
01:36:49,987 --> 01:36:50,347
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

740
01:36:50,868 --> 01:36:51,168
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay.

741
01:36:51,228 --> 01:36:55,351
[SPEAKER_16]: So this goes back to what Councilor Bears said earlier, or maybe it was you,

742
01:36:58,588 --> 01:36:58,788
[SPEAKER_16]: Ms.

743
01:36:58,828 --> 01:37:04,931
[SPEAKER_16]: Hunt, that there is a lot of access to the train station there.

744
01:37:04,951 --> 01:37:18,157
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm all for the zoning, but I just want to make sure that we're protecting access to our finally really newly redone West Medford train.

745
01:37:18,177 --> 01:37:23,800
[SPEAKER_16]: The folks who live on our side of the railroad tracks would have to go literally all the way around.

746
01:37:24,780 --> 01:37:27,321
[SPEAKER_16]: And then to catch the train that goes into the city.

747
01:37:27,361 --> 01:37:36,265
[SPEAKER_16]: So that's the only flag that I wanted to put up there about how we maintain access to public transportation.

748
01:37:37,205 --> 01:37:42,147
[SPEAKER_16]: With this kind of zoning, it looks like, I know it's not in practice, but it is an empty parking lot.

749
01:37:42,527 --> 01:37:46,009
[SPEAKER_16]: Someone could sell it and put something up and then we would have to figure that out.

750
01:37:49,854 --> 01:37:50,174
[SPEAKER_17]: definitely.

751
01:37:50,434 --> 01:37:51,394
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

752
01:37:52,155 --> 01:37:52,575
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, great.

753
01:37:53,115 --> 01:37:53,735
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

754
01:37:54,335 --> 01:37:54,615
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

755
01:37:54,655 --> 01:37:55,435
[SPEAKER_17]: Appreciate your comments.

756
01:37:55,475 --> 01:37:56,376
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for flagging that.

757
01:37:56,436 --> 01:38:06,958
[SPEAKER_17]: And yes, preserving and incentivizing greater access to the commuter rail has been something we've been servicing throughout the discussion of West Medford Square.

758
01:38:06,978 --> 01:38:12,460
[SPEAKER_17]: And it will probably be a West Medford Square specific incentive zoning stipulation as well.

759
01:38:14,120 --> 01:38:16,921
[SPEAKER_17]: Great, we'll proceed with other participants.

760
01:38:17,921 --> 01:38:19,602
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll go to Michael.

761
01:38:19,842 --> 01:38:21,022
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

762
01:38:21,082 --> 01:38:21,922
[SPEAKER_17]: You'll have three minutes.

763
01:38:23,763 --> 01:38:29,404
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, Michael Berkman, 83 Wallace Street in Somerville, but also at 1012 Bower Street behind the fire station.

764
01:38:29,424 --> 01:38:29,965
[SPEAKER_17]: Hang on, Michael.

765
01:38:30,005 --> 01:38:30,605
[SPEAKER_17]: We can't hear you.

766
01:38:31,725 --> 01:38:31,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.

767
01:38:34,146 --> 01:38:34,366
[SPEAKER_00]: Now?

768
01:38:34,626 --> 01:38:34,726
[SPEAKER_17]: OK.

769
01:38:34,986 --> 01:38:35,486
[SPEAKER_02]: That's better.

770
01:38:35,726 --> 01:38:36,046
[SPEAKER_02]: That's better.

771
01:38:37,567 --> 01:38:38,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.

772
01:38:39,439 --> 01:38:47,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael Berkman, 83 Wallace Street in Somerville, and also 1012 Bower Street, the building behind the fire station in West Bedford Square.

773
01:38:48,943 --> 01:39:04,608
[SPEAKER_00]: What I have is kind of a philosophical question, and it may be too late in the process really to ask this, but as I say, I've lived many years in Davis Square, which was an immensely successful neighborhood because of its human scale, small village characteristic.

774
01:39:04,949 --> 01:39:08,810
[SPEAKER_00]: People were attracted to go there to walk, to spend, it was a pleasure

775
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,300
[SPEAKER_00]: just to walk around.

776
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:13,321
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a very valuable thing, I think.

777
01:39:13,941 --> 01:39:23,903
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's central to what seems to be happening here is to put the highest buildings adjacent to High Street and have them taper outward into the residential neighborhood.

778
01:39:24,483 --> 01:39:30,104
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd observe that what you will lose by doing that is this sense of a small village.

779
01:39:31,724 --> 01:39:37,885
[SPEAKER_00]: And the things I'd point to are maybe Assembly Square, or if anybody's familiar with Kenleytown in Washington, D.C.,

780
01:39:38,670 --> 01:39:50,006
[SPEAKER_00]: You might get the same sort of characteristic where you've got commercial businesses on the ground floor, but all around you are buildings that go up five, six stories, three or four stories even.

781
01:39:50,046 --> 01:39:51,628
[SPEAKER_00]: The feeling is completely different.

782
01:39:52,278 --> 01:40:12,767
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's not too late to pose this question, I'm wondering whether you would not gain benefit from preserving the characteristic of the small village feel, building small buildings or maintaining small buildings along High Street, and then pushing the higher buildings outward so that you maintain this attractive

783
01:40:13,550 --> 01:40:29,485
[SPEAKER_00]: central business district where people want to go out in the evenings, and then you still have the residential density in a reasonable walking distance from your train station, but where you don't lose this characteristic of the village.

784
01:40:29,525 --> 01:40:32,288
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the human scale is really important.

785
01:40:32,882 --> 01:40:43,128
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that if we, and I value what the comment was about how the other constraints, the secondary constraints will help to maintain sunlight and all that's very important.

786
01:40:43,988 --> 01:40:57,276
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also wonder whether we're not going to lose something important by this approach rather than taking an approach that says, let's start with the small village at the center and then give a periphery that adds the density.

787
01:40:57,776 --> 01:40:58,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

788
01:41:04,305 --> 01:41:05,967
[SPEAKER_17]: Great, thank you for your comments.

789
01:41:06,267 --> 01:41:08,450
[SPEAKER_17]: Philosophical questions are certainly always welcome.

790
01:41:17,464 --> 01:41:20,708
[SPEAKER_17]: Plenty to respond to there I'll just say I think your perspective is welcome.

791
01:41:20,748 --> 01:41:33,124
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that there are a lot of ways that we've been discussing on how to preserve and achieve that attractive compelling pleasant neighborhood feel and certainly different successful village centers do that differently.

792
01:41:35,827 --> 01:41:43,910
[SPEAKER_17]: I also think that we're pretty constrained here by the existing character of smaller residential type buildings surrounding the square.

793
01:41:43,930 --> 01:41:51,352
[SPEAKER_17]: And I think it is incumbent upon us to work within those constraints to a certain extent.

794
01:41:53,965 --> 01:41:54,705
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for your comments.

795
01:41:55,205 --> 01:42:04,688
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, we will go to Cheryl, unless there's anybody who has not, oh, we'll go first to people who haven't spoken at all yet.

796
01:42:05,728 --> 01:42:08,389
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please, and then we'll go back to Zoom.

797
01:42:09,209 --> 01:42:10,149
[SPEAKER_18]: Excuse me.

798
01:42:10,370 --> 01:42:12,090
[SPEAKER_18]: Chuck Roach, 64 Bower Street.

799
01:42:13,290 --> 01:42:15,131
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm a little late to the party here.

800
01:42:15,831 --> 01:42:22,533
[SPEAKER_18]: We just got this flyer in the mailbox, and I noticed Bower Street on there, and I'm like, okay, what's going on here?

801
01:42:23,999 --> 01:42:30,183
[SPEAKER_18]: And when I saw the, you know, the cutting of the cake, I'm like, we're gonna put some four-story buildings on Bower Street.

802
01:42:30,203 --> 01:42:32,825
[SPEAKER_18]: And I'm like, so I'm trying to get educated one.

803
01:42:34,006 --> 01:42:49,717
[SPEAKER_18]: Then I sort of have a little question as far as like existing businesses, commercial real estate, like there's two big vacancies in West Medford Square that, you know, do we incentivize these landlords to say, hey, you know,

804
01:42:51,855 --> 01:42:57,578
[SPEAKER_18]: allow someone to come in here and do something instead of it being vacant for the past five years?

805
01:42:58,879 --> 01:43:03,782
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I don't know how you answer that or if you have a solution, but.

806
01:43:05,723 --> 01:43:05,983
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure.

807
01:43:08,145 --> 01:43:09,886
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll pause you then we can get back to the rest of your comments.

808
01:43:10,186 --> 01:43:12,147
[SPEAKER_17]: There's, I will say, I think this is, um,

809
01:43:13,510 --> 01:43:22,502
[SPEAKER_17]: I think what you're speaking to their strategies that we can address through zoning, a lot of dealing with existing small businesses outside of zoning, but I'll go to a quick response to Councilor.

810
01:43:23,576 --> 01:43:34,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I know the buildings you're talking about they have been the subject of attention from both the city council and the planning department and particularly the economic development director for a good while now.

811
01:43:35,287 --> 01:43:45,677
[SPEAKER_04]: The short answer is that those buildings are owned by somebody who has a lot of property and wants people and wants whoever is going to rent it out to put up like $120,000 in capital for repairs.

812
01:43:48,500 --> 01:43:52,925
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're just willing to sit on it for however long they need to because they just don't care.

813
01:43:53,045 --> 01:44:01,335
[SPEAKER_04]: And the city is basically the powers that the city has right now is to either do nothing or condemn it, which is like a nuclear option.

814
01:44:01,795 --> 01:44:08,163
[SPEAKER_04]: So we submitted a vacant building ordinance that, you know, I mean,

815
01:44:08,703 --> 01:44:13,907
[SPEAKER_04]: to be honest, we're probably not going to get to working on it before budget season is over, just because we're going to be slammed with work.

816
01:44:14,267 --> 01:44:22,693
[SPEAKER_04]: But we, but Councilor Lazzaro and I did put that through and we're working with the Chamber of Commerce to give the city more sort of

817
01:44:25,823 --> 01:44:31,985
[SPEAKER_04]: middle of the road tools to deal with situations like that.

818
01:44:32,525 --> 01:44:43,328
[SPEAKER_04]: It's private property, so there's only so much we can do, but it does allow us to do things like tell them that they have to put up public artworks instead of just having those boards right there.

819
01:44:44,188 --> 01:44:50,150
[SPEAKER_04]: And it says that they have to pay a yearly fee that's slightly higher than what they'd normally pay just to maintain that vacancy.

820
01:44:50,670 --> 01:44:51,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we want to

821
01:44:52,090 --> 01:44:59,376
[SPEAKER_04]: get the Chamber of Commerce on board with everything we're going to write in that before we actually pass that.

822
01:44:59,516 --> 01:45:03,759
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's definitely an ongoing thing that we've heard a good amount about.

823
01:45:05,260 --> 01:45:08,382
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, it was sort of a selfless thing.

824
01:45:08,442 --> 01:45:13,827
[SPEAKER_18]: I own CB Scoop, so trying to get more activity in the square is always good, you know what I mean?

825
01:45:13,927 --> 01:45:18,010
[SPEAKER_18]: But as far as the current proposal, though, this is

826
01:45:18,806 --> 01:45:23,690
[SPEAKER_18]: Beginning stages, future looking, I'll probably be dead when all this occurs, right?

827
01:45:24,370 --> 01:45:24,830
[SPEAKER_18]: Basically.

828
01:45:27,352 --> 01:45:27,833
[SPEAKER_18]: More or less.

829
01:45:33,837 --> 01:45:34,197
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotcha.

830
01:45:34,577 --> 01:45:34,938
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

831
01:45:35,098 --> 01:45:35,458
[SPEAKER_17]: Exactly.

832
01:45:35,878 --> 01:45:36,479
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for being here.

833
01:45:36,499 --> 01:45:37,439
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll stay informed now.

834
01:45:38,140 --> 01:45:38,400
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

835
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:39,241
[SPEAKER_17]: Please do.

836
01:45:44,324 --> 01:45:46,146
[SPEAKER_17]: I frequently say zoning

837
01:45:47,782 --> 01:45:56,889
[SPEAKER_17]: Through zoning, we're taking the kind of long-term vision for the community, what we'd like to see happen over the next five to 35 years, and writing that blueprint in our zoning map.

838
01:45:56,929 --> 01:45:59,851
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of those changes might happen faster than we think.

839
01:46:00,451 --> 01:46:02,733
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of them we wish would happen much faster.

840
01:46:02,773 --> 01:46:13,401
[SPEAKER_17]: I think a lot of the goals of our current zoning, we're still waiting to see them manifest, hence a lack of the vibrancy we'd like to see in the current Medford Square and the current West Medford Square.

841
01:46:13,461 --> 01:46:16,503
[SPEAKER_17]: So all that to say, it's tough to know.

842
01:46:17,285 --> 01:46:33,392
[SPEAKER_17]: when we will, when we will envisage that utopic West Medford Square that I think we can all see very clearly on our mind's eye, but these zoning changes, I think, in conjunction with more direct measures help us to incentivize more businesses coming in populating the squares.

843
01:46:34,812 --> 01:46:36,513
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to quickly add to that.

844
01:46:38,393 --> 01:46:42,216
[SPEAKER_02]: We've talked about all the different things that constrain, you know, who owns what and the lot size and all of that.

845
01:46:42,756 --> 01:46:55,125
[SPEAKER_02]: But, and you guys correct me on the specific numbers if I get them wrong, but I think the zoning that's been in place for at least 25 or 30 years, technically allows a 14 story hotel to be built in West Benford Square right now.

846
01:46:55,746 --> 01:46:56,747
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's never happened.

847
01:46:57,187 --> 01:46:59,649
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's that kind of, you know, thinking around it too.

848
01:47:00,109 --> 01:47:06,294
[SPEAKER_02]: We're actually in some ways would be reducing what's allowed in, you know,

849
01:47:07,107 --> 01:47:10,709
[SPEAKER_02]: The new zoning would not allow a 14-story hotel to be built in West Medford Square, right?

850
01:47:11,390 --> 01:47:16,873
[SPEAKER_02]: But even though it has been allowed for a really long time, no one ever wanted to do that or tried to do that.

851
01:47:17,074 --> 01:47:25,719
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've had a lot of moments in this meeting talking about how zoning is just one piece of a big puzzle.

852
01:47:26,480 --> 01:47:29,082
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope we get some of it before you're gone, though.

853
01:47:31,923 --> 01:47:35,686
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, so no more 14-story hotels, but yes to nine-story Seabee Scoops.

854
01:47:38,164 --> 01:47:38,624
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead, Bella.

855
01:47:38,964 --> 01:47:39,785
[SPEAKER_12]: Very quickly.

856
01:47:40,185 --> 01:47:43,587
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, also six story buildings are allowed in that commercial one area.

857
01:47:43,767 --> 01:47:45,908
[SPEAKER_12]: So and has happened not.

858
01:47:46,108 --> 01:47:48,790
[SPEAKER_12]: So it really depends on many things together.

859
01:47:49,610 --> 01:47:54,733
[SPEAKER_12]: One thing that I wanted to say, because already is the second time that the people think that maybe it's too late.

860
01:47:54,993 --> 01:47:55,953
[SPEAKER_12]: This is not too late.

861
01:47:56,273 --> 01:47:59,075
[SPEAKER_12]: We are really open still to all the comments.

862
01:47:59,615 --> 01:48:03,077
[SPEAKER_12]: This is a still in city council, a planning and permitting committee meeting.

863
01:48:03,477 --> 01:48:06,299
[SPEAKER_12]: it needs to still be referred to the city board.

864
01:48:06,699 --> 01:48:09,881
[SPEAKER_12]: Then on the city board, we will still listen to public comments.

865
01:48:09,961 --> 01:48:11,242
[SPEAKER_12]: There is still time to change.

866
01:48:11,782 --> 01:48:14,524
[SPEAKER_12]: And then it will come back to city council to be approved.

867
01:48:15,004 --> 01:48:18,506
[SPEAKER_12]: And we will still hear public comments.

868
01:48:18,526 --> 01:48:20,387
[SPEAKER_12]: So there are a lot of different stages.

869
01:48:20,907 --> 01:48:21,588
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not late.

870
01:48:22,008 --> 01:48:25,991
[SPEAKER_12]: So anything that you want to comment, any opinion, it can be done still.

871
01:48:26,131 --> 01:48:27,311
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you for that.

872
01:48:29,373 --> 01:48:29,613
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

873
01:48:29,853 --> 01:48:30,533
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Paola.

874
01:48:30,673 --> 01:48:31,454
[SPEAKER_17]: And we'll recap the

875
01:48:33,600 --> 01:48:33,840
[SPEAKER_12]: thing.

876
01:48:34,721 --> 01:48:36,162
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have so yeah, sorry.

877
01:48:36,502 --> 01:48:42,226
[SPEAKER_12]: And then next week, we also have a public meeting that we will be doing for the squares as well.

878
01:48:42,806 --> 01:48:43,587
[SPEAKER_12]: So may 7.

879
01:48:46,249 --> 01:48:47,830
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll share the meeting info at the end of the meeting.

880
01:48:47,870 --> 01:48:49,391
[SPEAKER_12]: May 8, I think is a Thursday.

881
01:48:50,371 --> 01:48:53,453
[SPEAKER_12]: But I will repeat that at the end so that we all get that.

882
01:48:53,654 --> 01:48:53,934
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

883
01:48:54,794 --> 01:48:55,275
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks, Paula.

884
01:48:56,015 --> 01:49:00,138
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, let's get to our last two public commentators on deck.

885
01:49:02,991 --> 01:49:04,472
[SPEAKER_17]: Cheryl, name and address for the record, please.

886
01:49:04,532 --> 01:49:05,152
[SPEAKER_17]: You have three minutes.

887
01:49:07,553 --> 01:49:09,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Cheryl Rodriguez, 281 Park Street.

888
01:49:10,494 --> 01:49:18,056
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the link that you posted at 621 that had the zoning language, so I was hope we can get it earlier next time so that we can review it.

889
01:49:18,936 --> 01:49:26,381
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely change the name of the MX1 because there are several differences in that opposed to the one on Salem Street.

890
01:49:26,862 --> 01:49:37,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Since you're allowing pot shops in the squares by ZBA approval and they were excluded from Salem Street, this can be very confusing, even to a developer who's trying to go through the zoning.

891
01:49:38,350 --> 01:49:46,856
[SPEAKER_01]: And I noticed in the NR3 in the West Medford Square that you're allowing scientific search, which also was not allowed in the NR3.

892
01:49:47,615 --> 01:49:49,336
[SPEAKER_01]: before the Community Development Board.

893
01:49:49,356 --> 01:50:03,585
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if these are typos, inconsistencies or differences, but I hope that someone will be going through and pulling this all together so that it's consistent and so that people can follow along and understand what's really coming for them.

894
01:50:03,725 --> 01:50:04,085
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

895
01:50:06,107 --> 01:50:07,088
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for your comment, Cheryl.

896
01:50:07,108 --> 01:50:23,578
[SPEAKER_17]: And I will say, I think that some of the differences, actually, I know that many of the differences in allowed uses between the squares and Mystic Avenue Corridor District and Salem Street Corridor District are intentional and have been the product of discussion.

897
01:50:25,079 --> 01:50:31,583
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we will continue to consider how it would make sense to differentiate the sub-district types so that they

898
01:50:32,303 --> 01:50:36,747
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's more intuitive that we're not talking about all MX2A when we're talking about MX2A, for example.

899
01:50:37,948 --> 01:50:38,228
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

900
01:50:39,049 --> 01:50:43,413
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, we will go to Marcella.

901
01:50:44,534 --> 01:50:46,076
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

902
01:50:46,416 --> 01:50:47,337
[SPEAKER_17]: You have three minutes.

903
01:50:49,878 --> 01:50:51,780
[SPEAKER_11]: Hello, my name is Marcel Rodriguez.

904
01:50:51,840 --> 01:51:01,852
[SPEAKER_11]: I live in 66 Canal Street, so I'm in that triangle that was mentioned earlier, and I'm really excited to see all of the changes that are being proposed.

905
01:51:03,614 --> 01:51:05,517
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, I can lower my hand here.

906
01:51:06,978 --> 01:51:15,586
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that I did just want to say a few things that came to mind as a resident and listening to the last meeting on this.

907
01:51:17,087 --> 01:51:21,171
[SPEAKER_11]: First off, I don't usually use North Station to commute.

908
01:51:21,211 --> 01:51:24,734
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm usually traveling into Cambridge or Somerville, so I rely on

909
01:51:26,235 --> 01:51:31,419
[SPEAKER_11]: the 94, 80 or biking and I was looking forward to the new Green Line extension.

910
01:51:31,900 --> 01:51:41,127
[SPEAKER_11]: I feel like the changes that I've seen coming through with the MBTA are reducing public transit access to the area with less 80 service cutting the 94,

911
01:51:42,788 --> 01:51:45,950
[SPEAKER_11]: Cutting the 96 route that comes closer to here.

912
01:51:46,451 --> 01:51:57,978
[SPEAKER_11]: So with considering proposals and that increased density, I'm wondering if there's any way to kind of follow any changes

913
01:51:58,558 --> 01:52:03,262
[SPEAKER_11]: to public transit developments that might also help to support the increased density.

914
01:52:04,983 --> 01:52:07,665
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's perhaps one concern.

915
01:52:07,685 --> 01:52:11,649
[SPEAKER_11]: The other is perhaps seconding the kind of challenges around the triangle.

916
01:52:12,069 --> 01:52:15,292
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of the land near the tracks is owned by the state.

917
01:52:16,192 --> 01:52:19,395
[SPEAKER_11]: So the parking is kind of like that area in the middle for the townhouses.

918
01:52:20,396 --> 01:52:24,199
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's already, I think, a little bit difficult to find

919
01:52:24,839 --> 01:52:29,344
[SPEAKER_11]: parking and we've had like some issues with double parking like parking the sidewalk and stuff there.

920
01:52:29,764 --> 01:52:40,194
[SPEAKER_11]: I am curious about the proposal to increase the canal street to go to the river potentially if that is something that's been discussed before and learn more about it.

921
01:52:40,914 --> 01:52:45,559
[SPEAKER_11]: Just any attention to like here in general be really interesting to continue to follow.

922
01:52:45,799 --> 01:52:46,019
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

923
01:52:49,592 --> 01:52:54,999
[SPEAKER_17]: Great, thank you so much for your comments for participating in this process.

924
01:52:58,204 --> 01:53:01,929
[SPEAKER_17]: Going next to Daniel name and address for the record, please.

925
01:53:01,989 --> 01:53:02,730
[SPEAKER_17]: You have three minutes.

926
01:53:05,255 --> 01:53:07,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Daniel Murdoch, 43 Dearborn Street.

927
01:53:08,077 --> 01:53:11,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you again, everybody for your efforts in this rezoning.

928
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:16,584
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you also in associates for your responses to my prior comments and questions.

929
01:53:17,645 --> 01:53:27,252
[SPEAKER_03]: As has been previously suggested by Councilor Collins, I strongly support the use of mixed use to be as the default within the West Medford Square zoning district.

930
01:53:28,233 --> 01:53:42,991
[SPEAKER_03]: As regarding comments about preserving and enhancing character, I believe that encouraging developers to use high quality materials could not only help preserve such character, but build and enhance that character rather than doing that through zoning.

931
01:53:44,292 --> 01:53:56,637
[SPEAKER_03]: I also strongly support even a further expansion of the West Medford Square zoning boundaries to include properties between Harvard Ave and the river and between Boston Ave and the train tracks.

932
01:53:56,697 --> 01:54:01,560
[SPEAKER_03]: In other words, on the left side of the train tracks, the southwest side rather than the northeast side.

933
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:09,143
[SPEAKER_03]: I think given the upzoning on the east side of the train tracks, I think it's also appropriate to do some upzoning on the west side of the tracks.

934
01:54:10,247 --> 01:54:22,539
[SPEAKER_03]: I do understand that there may be a need and it may be appropriate to exclude the triangle along canal street, given some fire concerns and maybe some other problematic issues there.

935
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:28,004
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do believe an expansion of the West Medford square boundaries even further would provide.

936
01:54:29,083 --> 01:54:36,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Important density to support the commercial aspirations of the area and the increased heights that would be sort of more in the core.

937
01:54:36,849 --> 01:54:48,097
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition, on the West side of the tracks, having some increased density may also provide a sound barrier on that side of the tracks as may occur in the future on the East side.

938
01:54:49,177 --> 01:54:59,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I do support increasing or upzoning properties that are outside the formal boundaries of the West Medford Square.

939
01:54:59,761 --> 01:55:10,484
[SPEAKER_03]: And I appreciate, thank you again, Innocent Associates for your comments that the residential zones are informed by current development within the surrounding community.

940
01:55:10,744 --> 01:55:15,426
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think this is an opportunity to increase density, not only in the core of each square,

941
01:55:16,046 --> 01:55:19,170
[SPEAKER_03]: but the areas surrounding the squares.

942
01:55:19,690 --> 01:55:36,850
[SPEAKER_03]: As a result, I strongly support the idea that properties that are maybe within a block or two of the formal boundaries be up-zoned, in this instance from NR3, to maybe, for example, UR1, or maybe even mixed-use 1, potentially along High Street, as was suggested earlier this month.

943
01:55:38,902 --> 01:55:55,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this would provide, as I said, additional density and maybe also a more gradual transition from the potential height that can occur with mixed use be down to the lower maximum height of three floors that I believe is allowed under NR3.

944
01:55:56,908 --> 01:56:08,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Lastly, as I previously expressed, I strongly support where reasonable reducing minimum parking requirements and setbacks in this area as well to ensure that rezoning efforts aren't artificially stymied.

945
01:56:08,939 --> 01:56:09,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.

946
01:56:09,499 --> 01:56:12,902
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

947
01:56:12,942 --> 01:56:14,504
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much for your comments, Daniel.

948
01:56:14,524 --> 01:56:15,785
[SPEAKER_17]: Really appreciate it.

949
01:56:18,793 --> 01:56:24,297
[SPEAKER_17]: similar question from me as there was before to NS Associates if possible.

950
01:56:26,779 --> 01:56:41,230
[SPEAKER_17]: I believe we've talked in a previous committee meeting about the southwest side of the train tracks and they're currently characterized under the neighborhood and urban residential proposal as NR3 to the previous commenter's question about

951
01:56:43,911 --> 01:56:50,740
[SPEAKER_17]: the considerations around aligning these with UR1 or MX1 as part of that step down.

952
01:56:54,272 --> 01:56:55,493
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to phrase it the way I did before.

953
01:56:55,553 --> 01:57:05,041
[SPEAKER_17]: Is there a short version of what we've discussed for that strip along the railway in terms of lot size leading to its designation as NR3?

954
01:57:05,061 --> 01:57:18,812
[SPEAKER_17]: And I know that earlier you said we're anticipating a tool that we'll look at next week that helps us look with more granularity at why certain lots are certain sub-districts and not others, but to the point about grading it into the square.

955
01:57:34,998 --> 01:57:35,999
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, yes.

956
01:57:36,159 --> 01:57:38,900
[SPEAKER_12]: So madam, if I may, um, but I'm chair.

957
01:57:39,520 --> 01:57:39,740
[SPEAKER_12]: Mm.

958
01:57:42,322 --> 01:57:45,983
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is, uh, we will study that for.

959
01:57:46,003 --> 01:57:54,947
[SPEAKER_12]: We will look into all the area residential to see if we're looking at, um.

960
01:57:56,408 --> 01:57:56,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Doing a higher

961
01:58:05,212 --> 01:58:06,173
[SPEAKER_12]: Um so.

962
01:58:06,193 --> 01:58:09,134
[SPEAKER_12]: In the next city board.

963
01:58:09,434 --> 01:58:11,214
[SPEAKER_12]: That's Wednesday next Wednesday.

964
01:58:11,234 --> 01:58:18,277
[SPEAKER_12]: We will present that interactive map and we will present the new, um, proposal.

965
01:58:18,297 --> 01:58:23,678
[SPEAKER_12]: Um and people will see, um, higher

966
01:58:31,201 --> 01:58:51,324
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a little of the thing with a mixed use is that we want to preserve the commercial area to incentivize what is already there as commercial to be renewed to be all the vacant lots and incentivize the square instead of

967
01:58:52,025 --> 01:58:56,448
[SPEAKER_12]: making too much of the mixed use area and extending that a lot.

968
01:58:57,649 --> 01:59:06,696
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that high street connection that could be some mixed use in there, because it's the connection to the downtown in Arlington, that it's the one that makes the most sense.

969
01:59:07,276 --> 01:59:13,801
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think that if we put a lot of the mixed use in the area, it might be

970
01:59:17,654 --> 01:59:25,181
[SPEAKER_12]: it will be not very good for what is existing already and where we want to concentrate the businesses.

971
01:59:26,182 --> 01:59:30,506
[SPEAKER_12]: So that would be one reason why we don't extend a lot more the mixed use.

972
01:59:31,247 --> 01:59:38,674
[SPEAKER_12]: But we will look into that new corridors in the next planning and permitting committee meeting and bring in that high street connection.

973
01:59:41,496 --> 01:59:43,297
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope that I answered.

974
01:59:43,477 --> 01:59:48,002
[SPEAKER_12]: If we go with a higher, we could go with urban one, urban two.

975
01:59:48,862 --> 01:59:52,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are possibilities that we are looking and we will be presenting in the next one.

976
01:59:53,026 --> 01:59:53,967
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

977
01:59:54,107 --> 02:00:05,277
[SPEAKER_12]: Just to answer Marcella Rodriguez about the public transit, what she commented was more outside the zoning scope.

978
02:00:06,418 --> 02:00:17,541
[SPEAKER_12]: What we can say is that if we bring more density to the area, the MBTA will increase because there would be a lot more demand for public transportation.

979
02:00:17,621 --> 02:00:22,122
[SPEAKER_12]: So that usually increases the public transit options.

980
02:00:23,382 --> 02:00:25,523
[SPEAKER_12]: So that is the correlation that we can give.

981
02:00:26,223 --> 02:00:33,604
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the extension of the Canal Street to the river, that makes a lot of sense, but that is not under our scope.

982
02:00:34,245 --> 02:00:35,465
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be great also to

983
02:00:36,546 --> 02:00:42,391
[SPEAKER_12]: to not having that dead end, but that is under the Department of Public Works, if I'm correct.

984
02:00:43,372 --> 02:00:45,414
[SPEAKER_12]: So those are the questions, the answers I have.

985
02:00:45,854 --> 02:00:48,236
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much for those responses, Paola, I really appreciate it.

986
02:00:54,133 --> 02:00:55,193
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry, too many windows open.

987
02:00:55,213 --> 02:00:55,934
[SPEAKER_17]: I lost my train of thought.

988
02:00:56,554 --> 02:00:57,194
[SPEAKER_17]: Makes a lot of sense.

989
02:00:57,414 --> 02:01:12,480
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, as has been spoken about the neighborhood and urban residential proposal, which is all of the kind of washed out areas on this map that are outside the boundaries of the squares themselves fall under the neighborhood and urban residential zoning proposal, which is very much still in process.

990
02:01:12,941 --> 02:01:21,444
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll be back at the CBP next Wednesday, May 7th, and I know that you're looking over the version of the map that the city council

991
02:01:23,004 --> 02:01:25,885
[SPEAKER_17]: and you've been working on an adjusted version as well.

992
02:01:25,925 --> 02:01:26,565
[SPEAKER_17]: That's responding.

993
02:01:26,625 --> 02:01:30,886
[SPEAKER_17]: That's respondent to public comment that's been received since that time.

994
02:01:30,906 --> 02:01:33,427
[SPEAKER_17]: I know there has been a lot of talk specifically around.

995
02:01:34,567 --> 02:01:38,948
[SPEAKER_17]: What is the default sub district that should go in the quarter mile radius outside of the T station?

996
02:01:39,148 --> 02:01:41,849
[SPEAKER_17]: I'd be interested to see if it's not already, um.

997
02:01:42,829 --> 02:01:44,269
[SPEAKER_17]: Proposal for an amendment to make that

998
02:01:49,522 --> 02:01:52,363
[SPEAKER_17]: appropriate to consider and help with that transition.

999
02:01:52,383 --> 02:01:54,104
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for speaking to that.

1000
02:01:54,144 --> 02:01:54,984
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll go to President Bears.

1001
02:01:56,185 --> 02:02:04,068
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to add that the bus network redesign, they justified their service changes based on demand.

1002
02:02:04,228 --> 02:02:06,389
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to back up Paola's point further.

1003
02:02:06,890 --> 02:02:07,790
[SPEAKER_17]: Yep.

1004
02:02:08,690 --> 02:02:09,011
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1005
02:02:10,151 --> 02:02:12,412
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, going back to Alex on Zoom.

1006
02:02:12,892 --> 02:02:13,773
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record.

1007
02:02:13,813 --> 02:02:14,533
[SPEAKER_17]: You have three minutes.

1008
02:02:16,210 --> 02:02:19,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, my, my name is Alex Giller, 53 Forest Street.

1009
02:02:20,051 --> 02:02:21,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, just had a generalized question.

1010
02:02:21,852 --> 02:02:26,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Are there, uh, traffic studies being done, uh, to support the increases?

1011
02:02:27,074 --> 02:02:41,899
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, something that comes out and says, you know, yeah, we can have an extra 20% traffic, 30, 40, 50%, whatever it may be, because I think we all can agree that the bottleneck going across the train tracks can be very frustrating at times, especially at certain hours of the day.

1012
02:02:42,060 --> 02:02:43,280
[SPEAKER_05]: And with it also being.

1013
02:02:43,896 --> 02:02:50,200
[SPEAKER_05]: the official trucking route to go from 93 to our neighboring communities of Arlington and Belmont.

1014
02:02:50,700 --> 02:03:01,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, all it does is just increase traffic on say like a canal street and then you're going over by Prescott and all of a sudden you have a heavy traffic stream going through by a Brooks elementary school.

1015
02:03:02,048 --> 02:03:11,634
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to see if somebody is, uh, actually looking into it and see, you know, whether all this new zoning can be supported by the current infrastructure.

1016
02:03:13,435 --> 02:03:13,695
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1017
02:03:17,125 --> 02:03:18,287
[SPEAKER_17]: Great, thank you for the question.

1018
02:03:18,447 --> 02:03:28,784
[SPEAKER_17]: Alex, this is something we've been talking about throughout this process on each of the major proposals that we've come across before.

1019
02:03:32,691 --> 02:03:42,254
[SPEAKER_17]: Ennis has been doing great work in considering intersectional studies and a host of context criteria when putting these zoning proposals together.

1020
02:03:43,555 --> 02:03:54,038
[SPEAKER_17]: When it comes to specific traffic studies, I think we use that term, that is something, the most appropriate use of a traffic study is kind of where they currently sit in site plan review.

1021
02:03:54,958 --> 02:03:59,680
[SPEAKER_17]: A traffic study done now as we craft new zoning that will be implemented

1022
02:04:01,441 --> 02:04:08,824
[SPEAKER_17]: kind of based on the will of private developers over the next several decades would quickly become dated and unuseful.

1023
02:04:11,346 --> 02:04:14,547
[SPEAKER_17]: So while that is a factor and how these zoning proposals come together.

1024
02:04:15,808 --> 02:04:36,345
[SPEAKER_17]: What's great about our public process for when major developments do come in is there's a baked-in process for those kind of context and mitigation studies and mitigation mechanisms that are respondent not to the conditions right now in the year 2025, but these specific conditions when a development is actually getting proposed and is about to be constructed.

1025
02:04:37,265 --> 02:04:48,171
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, so all that to say the context is absolutely an ingredient in these and the more specific mitigation studies and plans come into effect when specific developments are proposed.

1026
02:04:49,091 --> 02:04:51,272
[SPEAKER_17]: Anybody else want to speak to this quickly?

1027
02:04:51,292 --> 02:04:51,332
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

1028
02:04:53,673 --> 02:04:54,193
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1029
02:04:54,373 --> 02:04:55,774
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much for the comment.

1030
02:04:57,895 --> 02:04:58,155
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1031
02:04:58,215 --> 02:05:00,917
[SPEAKER_17]: I see no more public participation on this item.

1032
02:05:05,649 --> 02:05:10,313
[SPEAKER_17]: I think, do we have one more short section in the presentation for tonight, Paola?

1033
02:05:27,086 --> 02:05:27,867
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, sorry.

1034
02:05:29,513 --> 02:05:38,960
[SPEAKER_15]: So before presents a to use I do just want to note that we have provided the initial draft of the uses and the full dimensional standards.

1035
02:05:39,560 --> 02:05:45,885
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand those are online that will be updated again before our public meeting next week.

1036
02:05:47,446 --> 02:05:56,213
[SPEAKER_15]: There were some inconsistencies of changes that I made this afternoon that were not captured I think that's when my word and PDF.

1037
02:05:56,793 --> 02:05:57,133
[SPEAKER_15]: failed.

1038
02:05:58,174 --> 02:06:12,499
[SPEAKER_15]: So my apologies to city Councilors and members of the public for that that was on the uses side though I did double check the dimensional standards and they appear to be correct, but we will give you an updated version tomorrow, so it can be posted well before next week's meeting.

1039
02:06:13,739 --> 02:06:20,803
[SPEAKER_15]: But anybody who's curious about specifically what uses are allowed and the other dimensional requirements, other than the height.

1040
02:06:21,303 --> 02:06:32,548
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are in there, there is a list of definitions that we were looking at that are not current that either exist in your current table of uses and are not currently defined and people have.

1041
02:06:33,829 --> 02:06:42,534
[SPEAKER_15]: indicated confusion or questions about those or definitions that are new to what we're doing now that we need to add.

1042
02:06:43,335 --> 02:06:51,159
[SPEAKER_15]: And then we've we've repeated the sections for development standards, etc that we mentioned and incentive standards that we mentioned earlier.

1043
02:06:51,659 --> 02:06:56,702
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are also being looked at, we are hoping for additional public comment on those next week.

1044
02:06:57,123 --> 02:06:59,424
[SPEAKER_15]: And with that, I'm going to turn it back over to Paola for ADUs.

1045
02:07:04,716 --> 02:07:05,758
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Emily.

1046
02:07:07,882 --> 02:07:12,069
[SPEAKER_12]: Madam Chair, if I may, I'm going to share the screen.

1047
02:07:12,550 --> 02:07:12,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1048
02:07:26,700 --> 02:07:34,084
[SPEAKER_12]: So as well, this topic we've already discussed, but it's still open to comments.

1049
02:07:35,705 --> 02:07:44,951
[SPEAKER_12]: Again, I will go a little bit fast, but if anyone has any comment or any question, please let us know and we can explain a little bit further.

1050
02:07:45,571 --> 02:07:51,695
[SPEAKER_12]: So there is this topic about accessory dwelling unit, also known as ADUs.

1051
02:07:53,844 --> 02:07:59,099
[SPEAKER_12]: And what it's about is to just begin to give the first explanation and then we can go faster.

1052
02:08:01,543 --> 02:08:05,325
[SPEAKER_12]: It's about creating as an accessory use a dwelling unit.

1053
02:08:05,665 --> 02:08:08,427
[SPEAKER_12]: And this can be internal in your house.

1054
02:08:08,487 --> 02:08:09,468
[SPEAKER_12]: It can be attached.

1055
02:08:09,748 --> 02:08:16,532
[SPEAKER_12]: So to do a smaller expansion and attached to your primary building, your house, and it can be detached.

1056
02:08:16,712 --> 02:08:18,473
[SPEAKER_12]: So those are the three typologies.

1057
02:08:18,913 --> 02:08:23,676
[SPEAKER_12]: This is already something that you have in your current zoning that is existing in your current zoning.

1058
02:08:24,456 --> 02:08:32,443
[SPEAKER_12]: But there has been a very recent state law that has made this as a protected use.

1059
02:08:33,163 --> 02:08:43,672
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we are looking into what things need to change in your current zoning so that we can already update to be conforming with the mass general law.

1060
02:08:45,516 --> 02:08:51,140
[SPEAKER_12]: So from the city of Boston, they had this accessory dwelling unit guidebook.

1061
02:08:51,821 --> 02:08:56,445
[SPEAKER_12]: If you Google, you will find a very interesting guide.

1062
02:08:56,985 --> 02:08:58,446
[SPEAKER_12]: They have a lot of information.

1063
02:08:59,007 --> 02:09:08,494
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I have just some screenshots and images that are on that guidebook that to explain is very, very good.

1064
02:09:09,780 --> 02:09:19,905
[SPEAKER_12]: They give a lot of examples, a lot of different ways that an ADU could could be done in your house or in your building.

1065
02:09:21,706 --> 02:09:27,449
[SPEAKER_12]: And they organize it in small lot, medium lot and big lots.

1066
02:09:27,729 --> 02:09:30,370
[SPEAKER_12]: So in the beginning will be more of an internal

1067
02:09:30,964 --> 02:09:37,232
[SPEAKER_12]: unit that will be in attached or detached, but that kind of medium size.

1068
02:09:37,713 --> 02:09:41,738
[SPEAKER_12]: And then when there is a big lot, there can be a lot detached.

1069
02:09:43,761 --> 02:09:48,687
[SPEAKER_12]: So I just wanted to have it there for people to see it.

1070
02:09:50,729 --> 02:09:58,693
[SPEAKER_12]: Then they have done main definitions, which is the differentiation between protected use ADUs and local ADUs.

1071
02:09:59,013 --> 02:10:05,417
[SPEAKER_12]: So the protected use is going to be an ADU that is in a single family residential zoning district.

1072
02:10:05,457 --> 02:10:14,242
[SPEAKER_12]: This means any district that allows single family typologies as of right or as a special permit.

1073
02:10:15,502 --> 02:10:21,266
[SPEAKER_12]: They ask for a certain amount of square feet and are larger than 50% of your principal building.

1074
02:10:21,806 --> 02:10:23,788
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we have that local ADUs.

1075
02:10:23,928 --> 02:10:34,995
[SPEAKER_12]: And so that local ADUs, it's a lot more flexible, is what in this case will be Medford can adjust to decide how they want to do that ADU.

1076
02:10:35,075 --> 02:10:37,616
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's going to be a lot more flexible than that protected use.

1077
02:10:39,177 --> 02:10:43,440
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm going to go very quickly to this table.

1078
02:10:43,500 --> 02:10:46,502
[SPEAKER_12]: We showed this at the last city board.

1079
02:10:47,823 --> 02:10:56,748
[SPEAKER_12]: It was not nothing about voting about 80 years, but it was useful to understand with the residential neighborhoods how this was going to affect them.

1080
02:10:57,329 --> 02:11:02,172
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have the permitted building types and then the different districts that we have.

1081
02:11:03,533 --> 02:11:05,695
[SPEAKER_12]: are new districts that we are proposing.

1082
02:11:05,735 --> 02:11:13,221
[SPEAKER_12]: So from NR1, NR2, NR3, UR1 and UR2, and the permitted building types on each of them.

1083
02:11:13,241 --> 02:11:18,805
[SPEAKER_12]: And then when there would be a protected ADUs by right.

1084
02:11:18,926 --> 02:11:24,890
[SPEAKER_12]: And so we see that every time that we have that single unit dwelling appears the protected ADUs check.

1085
02:11:25,311 --> 02:11:26,332
[SPEAKER_12]: So NR1, NR2 and NR3.

1086
02:11:28,253 --> 02:11:34,081
[SPEAKER_12]: If we want to have by right a local ADU, what we are proposing is that you are one and you are two.

1087
02:11:34,622 --> 02:11:41,992
[SPEAKER_12]: They may add that local ADU, but only for two and three, one, two and three unit dwelling.

1088
02:11:43,574 --> 02:11:51,163
[SPEAKER_12]: And then there is a possibility of adding a second ADU, and that is going to be always by a special permit.

1089
02:11:51,243 --> 02:11:57,972
[SPEAKER_12]: So you can have a protected ADU, and then you can add a new one, and that would be by a special permit.

1090
02:11:59,272 --> 02:12:04,518
[SPEAKER_12]: And so then we added the maximum units with 80 years, we are excluding the historic conversion.

1091
02:12:05,980 --> 02:12:13,629
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we are still studying how we want to apply this in the residential districts, we will have a proposal for the next week.

1092
02:12:14,210 --> 02:12:16,692
[SPEAKER_12]: And so when our one would be your.

1093
02:12:17,733 --> 02:12:27,179
[SPEAKER_12]: single unit dwelling, and then the protected ADU plus the local ADU, you can have up to three in the same lot, two of them being accessory dwelling units.

1094
02:12:27,839 --> 02:12:39,366
[SPEAKER_12]: And so in NR2, you would have up to four, NR3 up to five, UR1 up to five, because we are only allowing it for two and three, or well, one, two and three dwelling units.

1095
02:12:40,427 --> 02:12:44,910
[SPEAKER_12]: And then UR2 also would be for three plus two,

1096
02:12:45,530 --> 02:12:47,992
[SPEAKER_12]: and then five, in total of five.

1097
02:12:50,193 --> 02:13:00,260
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is for the ADUs, we thought that this would be helpful, because this protected use in local and by riding special permit, we know is complex.

1098
02:13:01,901 --> 02:13:08,225
[SPEAKER_12]: And then what we need to still to be decided and this is something that we have come to some conclusions, but we wanted to

1099
02:13:09,826 --> 02:13:16,331
[SPEAKER_12]: we're going to allow it.

1100
02:13:16,471 --> 02:13:18,232
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's going to be by special permit.

1101
02:13:18,532 --> 02:13:19,373
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the first thing.

1102
02:13:19,994 --> 02:13:23,997
[SPEAKER_12]: The second thing is that the local 80 you by special permit.

1103
02:13:24,497 --> 02:13:26,639
[SPEAKER_12]: The maximum square footage is going to be.

1104
02:13:27,479 --> 02:13:29,421
[SPEAKER_12]: Always as the as the

1105
02:13:35,505 --> 02:13:54,353
[SPEAKER_12]: the three is going to be we could allow bigger detached ADUs for historic accessory structures and so this is if you have a barn that is a struct or any other structure that is more than 75 years old and it has any and you would like to

1106
02:13:55,353 --> 02:14:05,165
[SPEAKER_12]: use the ADU to recover and to reform that historic structure, what we want to do is to allow a bigger square footage.

1107
02:14:05,566 --> 02:14:10,992
[SPEAKER_12]: And it might be that the maximum is 1200, we can still discuss what that maximum would be.

1108
02:14:11,433 --> 02:14:15,017
[SPEAKER_12]: But this is to help to renew that historic structures.

1109
02:14:16,973 --> 02:14:25,398
[SPEAKER_12]: And also to understand that the other limit of size is with the percentage.

1110
02:14:25,478 --> 02:14:29,600
[SPEAKER_12]: So 50% of the principal building.

1111
02:14:30,161 --> 02:14:37,905
[SPEAKER_12]: And a lot of times if you have a historic accessory structure and that 50% won't allow you actually to recover.

1112
02:14:37,925 --> 02:14:41,627
[SPEAKER_12]: So we want to cut from that regulation.

1113
02:14:42,868 --> 02:14:46,389
[SPEAKER_12]: and then the dimensions are going to be studied.

1114
02:14:46,710 --> 02:15:07,541
[SPEAKER_12]: And we want to do that after the approval of the residential districts, because the sizes for setbacks and for it will right now we have a current zoning so we can do the ADU for the current zoning, but then whenever we adapt to the new residential districts, we would have to readapt it to the new one.

1115
02:15:07,621 --> 02:15:11,263
[SPEAKER_12]: So we will study all these dimension standards

1116
02:15:12,023 --> 02:15:13,945
[SPEAKER_12]: after the residential districts.

1117
02:15:15,526 --> 02:15:17,467
[SPEAKER_12]: And that would be it.

1118
02:15:17,747 --> 02:15:17,887
Yeah.

1119
02:15:19,929 --> 02:15:20,169
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

1120
02:15:20,369 --> 02:15:22,150
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much for that overview, Paola.

1121
02:15:22,231 --> 02:15:29,256
[SPEAKER_17]: And this is a topic that we have discussed in depth in committee, I think twice before now.

1122
02:15:30,877 --> 02:15:34,579
[SPEAKER_17]: So thank you for all of the adjustments that you've made so far.

1123
02:15:34,640 --> 02:15:35,040
[SPEAKER_17]: I know we've

1124
02:15:36,862 --> 02:15:50,716
[SPEAKER_17]: It's been great to get very solid on what is mandated by the new state law, which requires that ADUs be permissible by right in any zoning sub-district that allows single-family zoning by right, and then to spend the time that was needed on those questions of

1125
02:15:52,618 --> 02:15:53,578
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are protected ADUs.

1126
02:15:53,598 --> 02:15:57,340
[SPEAKER_17]: For the local ADUs where the city has more discretion, how do we want to answer those questions?

1127
02:15:58,661 --> 02:16:11,988
[SPEAKER_17]: Based on my notes from the committee's past couple of conversations, it sounded to me like there was general consensus that we were okay with a second ADU being allowed as long as it was always by special permit, which is what I heard in your presentation.

1128
02:16:12,968 --> 02:16:25,357
[SPEAKER_17]: It sounded like there were good reasons for keeping the special permit local ADU at a maximum of 900 square feet, just to affirm that these are intended to be accessory dwellings.

1129
02:16:27,279 --> 02:16:31,141
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm always trying to find the synonym for inferior, not inferior to, but smaller than.

1130
02:16:31,882 --> 02:16:35,524
[SPEAKER_17]: Diminutive to, the main structure.

1131
02:16:35,564 --> 02:16:37,286
[SPEAKER_17]: After two hours, my vocabulary starts to...

1132
02:16:40,761 --> 02:16:41,422
[SPEAKER_17]: Correct me if I'm wrong.

1133
02:16:41,442 --> 02:16:49,228
[SPEAKER_17]: I think the only two questions that are new to this discussion are, should bigger detached ADUs be allowed for historic accessory structures?

1134
02:16:49,808 --> 02:16:55,353
[SPEAKER_17]: And then those dimensions, which will be tailored after the residential districts are proposed.

1135
02:16:56,354 --> 02:17:04,320
[SPEAKER_17]: It sounded to me like the recommendation was that larger detached ADUs sometimes make sense for historic accessory structures.

1136
02:17:07,336 --> 02:17:17,299
[SPEAKER_17]: because you want the accessory use to fit the building envelope and the intent is to use an existing smaller structure that's not big enough to be a principal dwelling, but can work as an accessory structure.

1137
02:17:17,339 --> 02:17:19,780
[SPEAKER_17]: Am I paraphrasing that roughly correctly?

1138
02:17:21,180 --> 02:17:22,100
[SPEAKER_17]: Seeing not, great.

1139
02:17:25,141 --> 02:17:33,864
[SPEAKER_17]: Are there any questions, comments from councilors on the proposed updates to the ADU regulations?

1140
02:17:40,730 --> 02:17:41,130
[SPEAKER_17]: seeing none.

1141
02:17:41,230 --> 02:17:45,674
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's a testament to the lots of discussion that we've had on this in the past.

1142
02:17:45,714 --> 02:18:04,530
[SPEAKER_17]: And I also, I know that the NS Associates gave not a presentation of the proposal per se, but kind of an overview and introduction to the topic of ADUs to the CDB at their last meeting, which I'm sure will be very helpful groundwork for when they consider this proposal after it is reported out of committee, hopefully tonight.

1143
02:18:09,910 --> 02:18:14,192
[SPEAKER_17]: And some of the graphics that were included in this presentation, I understand, were created for them.

1144
02:18:14,233 --> 02:18:15,113
[SPEAKER_17]: I think they're really additive.

1145
02:18:16,114 --> 02:18:19,816
[SPEAKER_17]: So seeing no comments from councilors, we will go to public participation.

1146
02:18:21,156 --> 02:18:23,338
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll go to the podium and then to Zoom.

1147
02:18:27,178 --> 02:18:28,459
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address for the record, please.

1148
02:18:29,000 --> 02:18:29,580
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Madam Chair.

1149
02:18:29,600 --> 02:18:31,141
[SPEAKER_10]: Gasconfeira 61, Stigno Road.

1150
02:18:32,062 --> 02:18:33,864
[SPEAKER_10]: So I have three questions, three quick questions.

1151
02:18:34,204 --> 02:18:37,787
[SPEAKER_10]: The first two, I emailed the Applying Development Sustainability Office two weeks ago.

1152
02:18:38,768 --> 02:18:39,949
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't get a response.

1153
02:18:40,029 --> 02:18:42,811
[SPEAKER_10]: I followed up twice and I didn't get a response either.

1154
02:18:42,851 --> 02:18:47,054
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm glad that I have this opportunity to ask a question because otherwise it would probably never get answered.

1155
02:18:47,655 --> 02:18:52,979
[SPEAKER_10]: So the first one was that, so the local ADUs in UR1 and UR2,

1156
02:18:54,620 --> 02:19:04,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Since that's by the decision of the city council, I was wondering whether it was evaluated, whether it would make it more efficient to allow an extra story.

1157
02:19:04,042 --> 02:19:15,004
[SPEAKER_10]: So four stories total rather than three versus allowing potentially two ADUs, because I'm concerned about the inefficiency of keep building horizontally versus vertically.

1158
02:19:15,864 --> 02:19:18,805
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's a question that I had, whether that was evaluated.

1159
02:19:20,445 --> 02:19:28,628
[SPEAKER_10]: The second one is that I'm still only for your one and your two, given that we don't allow single family housing in those districts.

1160
02:19:30,409 --> 02:19:35,171
[SPEAKER_10]: The second question was, I'm still not 100% sure on, for example, in NR2.

1161
02:19:37,722 --> 02:19:44,744
[SPEAKER_10]: When a history conversion allows two to three units, I'm not 100% sure on what the two to three means.

1162
02:19:44,804 --> 02:19:51,045
[SPEAKER_10]: So does it mean that we have a single family house that we could do a history conversion to two units?

1163
02:19:51,805 --> 02:19:56,866
[SPEAKER_10]: And then if we had a two family house, then we could do the two to three families?

1164
02:19:57,306 --> 02:20:00,687
[SPEAKER_10]: Or does it mean up to three, meaning that one could be up to three?

1165
02:20:01,147 --> 02:20:01,447
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.

1166
02:20:02,928 --> 02:20:08,212
[SPEAKER_10]: And then the last question, which I think probably alluded to, but I didn't understand fully.

1167
02:20:08,572 --> 02:20:13,575
[SPEAKER_10]: So on the table on page, it's basically the previous to the last page.

1168
02:20:13,775 --> 02:20:19,879
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's a, I don't know what page it is, but on the table on NR1 where like, it lists the maximum that you can build.

1169
02:20:20,499 --> 02:20:23,901
[SPEAKER_10]: So why is historic conversion not included?

1170
02:20:23,921 --> 02:20:25,222
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that you're still evaluating that?

1171
02:20:25,262 --> 02:20:30,966
[SPEAKER_10]: Because for example, for NR1, we could go up to four if we have a historic conversion from one to two.

1172
02:20:35,887 --> 02:20:40,029
[SPEAKER_17]: If you don't mind, Gaston, why don't you just say your questions now, and then we'll just pass the microphone.

1173
02:20:40,049 --> 02:20:41,089
[SPEAKER_10]: The last is not a question.

1174
02:20:41,149 --> 02:20:53,775
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm still concerned that either two local ADUs or the protected ADU plus a local ADU, it's kind of a loophole to add more density.

1175
02:20:54,335 --> 02:20:57,676
[SPEAKER_10]: And it just completely dilutes the purpose of an ADU.

1176
02:20:57,716 --> 02:21:01,358
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I want to remind everyone that the protected ADU, we could build up to 900 square feet.

1177
02:21:01,738 --> 02:21:06,183
[SPEAKER_10]: and the local ADU we could build up to 1200 square feet which summed together

1178
02:21:08,349 --> 02:21:16,535
[SPEAKER_10]: since 2100 square feet, which is bigger than most houses in the area, is effectively building another house next to existing houses.

1179
02:21:17,816 --> 02:21:23,039
[SPEAKER_10]: And in the comment that I made about UR1 and UR2, I just wanted to clarify that.

1180
02:21:24,400 --> 02:21:31,846
[SPEAKER_10]: So I don't think banning the ADU would be the way to go, but just restrict it to internal.

1181
02:21:32,798 --> 02:21:39,225
[SPEAKER_10]: So because we're restricted to internal and we allow an extra floor, then again, we're not expanding horizontally versus vertically.

1182
02:21:39,265 --> 02:21:39,866
[SPEAKER_10]: So just a thought.

1183
02:21:39,966 --> 02:21:40,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1184
02:21:40,847 --> 02:21:41,408
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you, Gaston.

1185
02:21:54,858 --> 02:21:55,299
[SPEAKER_12]: If I may.

1186
02:21:55,319 --> 02:21:56,419
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1187
02:21:57,080 --> 02:21:59,941
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Gaston, for your comments, as always.

1188
02:22:01,482 --> 02:22:02,082
[SPEAKER_12]: Very thorough.

1189
02:22:03,983 --> 02:22:05,264
[SPEAKER_12]: So about the height.

1190
02:22:05,284 --> 02:22:08,645
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you commented in the in the last one.

1191
02:22:08,665 --> 02:22:15,969
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that for the UR1 wouldn't be necessary, because you can do it

1192
02:22:16,849 --> 02:22:18,809
[SPEAKER_12]: internally as a dormer.

1193
02:22:19,150 --> 02:22:22,830
[SPEAKER_12]: It doesn't have to be a complete new story.

1194
02:22:23,890 --> 02:22:28,771
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't know how efficient that would be, and that would be adding to the UR1 to UR4 stories.

1195
02:22:29,212 --> 02:22:41,734
[SPEAKER_12]: But we are evaluating for UR2 to have that extra floor, fourth floor.

1196
02:22:41,774 --> 02:22:46,035
[SPEAKER_12]: So next week, we can evaluate that a little bit further.

1197
02:22:46,795 --> 02:22:59,267
[SPEAKER_12]: But we are looking into that just to remind for your one and your two, even though we allow in your one six units, you cannot do for a building that is six units at two more.

1198
02:22:59,548 --> 02:23:00,849
[SPEAKER_12]: It's only for a three unit.

1199
02:23:01,449 --> 02:23:01,569
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

1200
02:23:02,670 --> 02:23:02,870
[SPEAKER_12]: Um.

1201
02:23:04,352 --> 02:23:07,836
[SPEAKER_12]: Then the, um so the historic conversion.

1202
02:23:07,976 --> 02:23:12,601
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so you can add what we we're still studying because we have two options.

1203
02:23:12,762 --> 02:23:18,428
[SPEAKER_12]: One is always to allow one more unit than what the district allows, and that is an inner

1204
02:23:22,512 --> 02:23:26,754
[SPEAKER_12]: But we are also evaluating that a lot of these houses are very, very big.

1205
02:23:27,014 --> 02:23:31,636
[SPEAKER_12]: And so they would allow for more than just two, for example, in one.

1206
02:23:31,656 --> 02:23:40,560
[SPEAKER_12]: And if we want to maintain them and incentivize that restoring that historical houses only for two units wouldn't be economically feasible.

1207
02:23:41,440 --> 02:23:48,125
[SPEAKER_12]: So we want to establish that maybe what we can do is to have a minimum square footage.

1208
02:23:48,165 --> 02:23:52,648
[SPEAKER_12]: So at least that you need 900 square foot to give the amount of units.

1209
02:23:52,688 --> 02:23:58,693
[SPEAKER_12]: So you will divide the amount of a square foot by 900 and the units that you can make.

1210
02:23:59,733 --> 02:24:02,676
[SPEAKER_12]: always keeping in mind we have the parking requirements.

1211
02:24:02,736 --> 02:24:05,819
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a lot of other requirements that they need to steal.

1212
02:24:06,980 --> 02:24:12,045
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, that will control, um, the amount of units.

1213
02:24:12,185 --> 02:24:16,169
[SPEAKER_12]: The amount of units is not only the minimum square footage.

1214
02:24:16,349 --> 02:24:18,712
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not only about the height is not only about

1215
02:24:20,313 --> 02:24:36,824
[SPEAKER_12]: the units density that we allow, but there are all these different things, open public space, the green score for multifamily, so many things that will also ask and give restrictions to these units.

1216
02:24:38,920 --> 02:24:41,361
[SPEAKER_12]: So that will answer that adding the density.

1217
02:24:42,941 --> 02:24:44,421
[SPEAKER_12]: One will be by special permit.

1218
02:24:44,821 --> 02:24:58,284
[SPEAKER_12]: The other one we asked to be by, so local ADUs for special permit, what we are asking is to be from 1,200 as the state suggests, we are going to 900.

1219
02:24:59,044 --> 02:25:01,724
[SPEAKER_12]: So all the ADUs will be maximum 900.

1220
02:25:02,365 --> 02:25:03,365
[SPEAKER_12]: So we don't have that 1,200 anymore.

1221
02:25:06,726 --> 02:25:08,227
[SPEAKER_12]: And the density is always the same.

1222
02:25:08,287 --> 02:25:11,309
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have the parking to allow that many density?

1223
02:25:12,030 --> 02:25:14,111
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you have the open space?

1224
02:25:14,692 --> 02:25:28,761
[SPEAKER_12]: So all of those requirements will still in these lower density areas where they are lower density because there is or private ways or because there is no public transit nearby or all these other reasons.

1225
02:25:30,722 --> 02:25:36,923
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not that we want to encourage the density in those areas, and we want to encourage the density where we have all these services.

1226
02:25:38,764 --> 02:25:44,985
[SPEAKER_12]: But we think that allowing that special permit, if they have the space, we think that is very feasible.

1227
02:25:46,065 --> 02:25:48,706
[SPEAKER_12]: Am I missing something?

1228
02:25:49,346 --> 02:25:49,866
[SPEAKER_12]: OK, perfect.

1229
02:25:50,926 --> 02:25:51,326
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1230
02:25:51,607 --> 02:25:51,887
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

1231
02:25:54,627 --> 02:25:56,028
Go for it.

1232
02:25:56,748 --> 02:25:57,008
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1233
02:25:59,937 --> 02:26:05,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Just so I understand it, it's mostly around the historical conversions.

1234
02:26:06,901 --> 02:26:14,225
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're in an NR3, which allows a historical conversion for, and you'd have a protected ADU.

1235
02:26:14,245 --> 02:26:18,427
[SPEAKER_02]: That would allow a protected ADU on that property as well because it's in the NR3.

1236
02:26:18,487 --> 02:26:18,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1237
02:26:21,109 --> 02:26:23,690
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'd have a local bus.

1238
02:26:24,431 --> 02:26:25,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I support special permit.

1239
02:26:27,660 --> 02:26:30,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is framed as, do we want second at all?

1240
02:26:30,382 --> 02:26:31,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want it by special permit?

1241
02:26:32,143 --> 02:26:35,766
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we want to allow higher maximum lot size for like a large carriage house?

1242
02:26:36,866 --> 02:26:38,427
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what the slide means?

1243
02:26:40,108 --> 02:26:40,249
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1244
02:26:40,549 --> 02:26:40,789
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.

1245
02:26:41,069 --> 02:26:41,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to make sure.

1246
02:26:41,810 --> 02:26:43,271
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to misinterpret it.

1247
02:26:46,793 --> 02:26:50,115
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I wonder if I can see where it starts.

1248
02:26:50,135 --> 02:26:56,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in general, the genesis of the state law and the ADU protection and all of this

1249
02:26:58,417 --> 02:27:03,518
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the intent is good, but I think it's structurally confusing.

1250
02:27:04,899 --> 02:27:13,001
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's intended to say, we need more units, and this is a way to do it without the state changing Chapter 48 to say, you have to allow two units everywhere.

1251
02:27:13,321 --> 02:27:18,603
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little bit of an end run, and I think it creates, for us,

1252
02:27:20,870 --> 02:27:23,011
[SPEAKER_02]: there's just some negative externalities here.

1253
02:27:23,031 --> 02:27:25,532
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think mostly what I'm getting at is around the historical conversion.

1254
02:27:25,552 --> 02:27:34,995
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're creating a thing with historical conversion that adds like a third layer to the whole problem where it's, how do you know how many units can be allowed on a lot?

1255
02:27:35,035 --> 02:27:39,256
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just wondering if there's a way to

1256
02:27:43,114 --> 02:27:50,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Could we say that we would allow a special permit, a second ADU by special permit, but not if it's a historic conversion or something like that?

1257
02:27:50,141 --> 02:27:59,670
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a little bit simpler for people to understand, especially when it comes to like, you'd have a principal structure, then a historical conversion, then the ADU, and then the second special permit ADU.

1258
02:28:00,270 --> 02:28:05,375
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it adds, it's again, one of those things where the layers are really stacked on top of each other.

1259
02:28:06,955 --> 02:28:08,756
[SPEAKER_15]: I appreciate all that, Councilor Bears.

1260
02:28:08,836 --> 02:28:18,000
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanna confirm or clarify that the question number three about adding the bigger, it's about a detached ADU.

1261
02:28:18,340 --> 02:28:29,425
[SPEAKER_15]: So for example, if you had a historic house with a historic barn, would you want to allow a larger ADU in order to be able to use the square footage of the barn appropriately?

1262
02:28:29,485 --> 02:28:31,726
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I very quickly used the word carriage house.

1263
02:28:31,826 --> 02:28:33,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, carriage house is exactly.

1264
02:28:33,287 --> 02:28:34,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Garage, garage is what I meant.

1265
02:28:34,587 --> 02:28:35,308
[SPEAKER_15]: Something like that.

1266
02:28:36,048 --> 02:28:41,875
[SPEAKER_15]: So, so, so with that, again, that could also be a special permit.

1267
02:28:42,115 --> 02:28:51,125
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, right, rather than making the because what you're saying is, we're going to allow a larger at you because this is a historic garage or bar, or whichever.

1268
02:28:52,145 --> 02:28:55,566
[SPEAKER_15]: But we want to do that by special permit to see what else is going on in the lot.

1269
02:28:55,626 --> 02:29:01,327
[SPEAKER_15]: So that could be a possibility but I did want to clarify that that was specific to a detached historic.

1270
02:29:01,607 --> 02:29:12,910
[SPEAKER_15]: So I think what we said, historic accessory structure that it wasn't intended to be the conversion of the historic principal house right so in that in that particular question.

1271
02:29:13,210 --> 02:29:23,136
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, that historic principal house, single unit dwelling or two family or whatever, or two unit or whatever, could also have the protected ADU.

1272
02:29:23,376 --> 02:29:23,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1273
02:29:24,357 --> 02:29:26,638
[SPEAKER_15]: Or the special permit local ADU.

1274
02:29:26,998 --> 02:29:30,240
[SPEAKER_15]: But the question was more about the area for the accessory structure.

1275
02:29:30,580 --> 02:29:30,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1276
02:29:30,860 --> 02:29:31,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1277
02:29:31,301 --> 02:29:35,323
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think my question is just like,

1278
02:29:36,940 --> 02:29:39,101
[SPEAKER_02]: there's probably not a lot of properties with supplies, right?

1279
02:29:39,181 --> 02:30:06,068
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's maybe not worth our time at this point to really get into it that far, but you have a single family, it's NR3, you have historic conversion, it's of significant size, significant lot size, so you can put four units inside the structure, then you could add the protected ADU, then you could have a special permit ADU detached or attached, and it just, yeah, so.

1280
02:30:07,760 --> 02:30:14,713
[SPEAKER_15]: But remembering the cost of doing all those conversions, as we talked about, it's the externalities to the zoning.

1281
02:30:15,275 --> 02:30:16,477
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, you could allow that.

1282
02:30:17,479 --> 02:30:18,881
[SPEAKER_15]: Could somebody afford that?

1283
02:30:20,150 --> 02:30:24,414
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just thinking if they're doing it all, they're probably doing it all at once, so they probably are going to maximize.

1284
02:30:24,514 --> 02:30:27,136
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's where... And that's where that problem comes in.

1285
02:30:27,496 --> 02:30:38,886
[SPEAKER_15]: So we can continue to delve into those potentials and see if we maybe could actually do a search and see if we could find something that would act as a case study, basically.

1286
02:30:39,226 --> 02:30:39,587
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.

1287
02:30:39,687 --> 02:30:50,082
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, just to remind that the parking break requirements for a four unit and then for the to 80 years in the areas where we don't have high transit.

1288
02:30:50,903 --> 02:30:54,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, are going to be quite quite high, something like.

1289
02:30:55,289 --> 02:31:24,616
[SPEAKER_12]: eight cars, you know, so the possibility that you have that big space, and if you have that lot, maybe why not, because it can be quite protected, it's not going to affect really the vision of the area, if that lot is that big, because you also need the percentage of the building out of that area is going to be 45 or 50 or something, I don't remember exactly, but you have a smaller build-out, you have a lot of open space requirement,

1290
02:31:25,256 --> 02:31:28,058
[SPEAKER_12]: So imagine that that could be possible.

1291
02:31:28,078 --> 02:31:30,239
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not going to be in a 5,000 square foot lot.

1292
02:31:30,539 --> 02:31:30,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1293
02:31:31,199 --> 02:31:31,860
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, thanks.

1294
02:31:34,041 --> 02:31:34,241
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

1295
02:31:34,942 --> 02:31:35,322
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

1296
02:31:35,342 --> 02:31:38,704
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to go to Daniel Murdoch on Zoom.

1297
02:31:40,345 --> 02:31:41,285
[SPEAKER_17]: Name and address of the record.

1298
02:31:41,325 --> 02:31:42,085
[SPEAKER_17]: You have three minutes.

1299
02:31:43,646 --> 02:31:46,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, my name is Daniel Murdoch, 43 Dearborn Street.

1300
02:31:47,448 --> 02:31:49,630
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate the discussion on this topic.

1301
02:31:50,518 --> 02:31:56,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I do support a local ADU by right for UR1 and UR2.

1302
02:31:57,339 --> 02:32:10,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I also strongly support the recommendation that for detached ADUs for historic accessory structures should be able to potentially exceed the 900 square feet that is elsewhere.

1303
02:32:10,482 --> 02:32:19,164
[SPEAKER_03]: I can attest I have a historic barn carriage house on my single family home property in South Medford.

1304
02:32:20,128 --> 02:32:25,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say I've considered converting it, but I know it would be over 900 square feet since it's two stories.

1305
02:32:26,193 --> 02:32:36,082
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think if I had to get a special permit, that would obviously disincentivize me from going through that process just because it's much more complicated.

1306
02:32:38,453 --> 02:32:41,534
[SPEAKER_03]: As regarding parking requirements, I think that's important.

1307
02:32:42,134 --> 02:32:47,215
[SPEAKER_03]: I do support a reduced parking requirement for ADUs since they are intentionally smaller than typical homes.

1308
02:32:47,856 --> 02:32:54,137
[SPEAKER_03]: But when that's coupled with walking distance to, say, the T along the green line, for example.

1309
02:32:55,218 --> 02:32:55,498
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

1310
02:32:58,158 --> 02:32:59,019
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

1311
02:32:59,059 --> 02:33:00,319
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you so much for your comments, Daniel.

1312
02:33:06,750 --> 02:33:09,540
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, is there any final public participation on this item?

1313
02:33:11,889 --> 02:33:12,150
[SPEAKER_17]: Gaston?

1314
02:33:16,807 --> 02:33:20,369
[SPEAKER_10]: I just got a quick question based on what Paola just said.

1315
02:33:20,409 --> 02:33:23,531
[SPEAKER_10]: So how would parking requirements work on private waste?

1316
02:33:23,851 --> 02:33:30,135
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's say, because this is a huge increase in density, so we can go from one to four, as it's on that table.

1317
02:33:30,815 --> 02:33:37,319
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it's NR2, there's a bunch of NR2 that is on private waste, we can go from one to five.

1318
02:33:38,680 --> 02:33:42,222
[SPEAKER_10]: So how would the parking requirement work in private waste?

1319
02:33:44,581 --> 02:33:49,683
[SPEAKER_10]: because we're not close to, I'm 2.2 miles away from the closest transit.

1320
02:33:51,263 --> 02:34:01,227
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just wondering if parking requirements don't apply to private ways, and it could be a traffic, like in terms of parking, no traffic, well, traffic too, but parking nightmare.

1321
02:34:02,467 --> 02:34:02,767
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1322
02:34:03,148 --> 02:34:06,169
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.

1323
02:34:08,429 --> 02:34:11,531
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the parking requirements are for off-street parking.

1324
02:34:14,428 --> 02:34:16,129
[SPEAKER_02]: it would be on the lot itself.

1325
02:34:17,229 --> 02:34:19,349
[SPEAKER_02]: So the private way, public way, it doesn't matter.

1326
02:34:19,410 --> 02:34:21,390
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about the parking on the lot.

1327
02:34:23,651 --> 02:34:33,454
[SPEAKER_02]: So whatever the parking mandate is that the city imposes, you know, if one per whatever, I think we have a one per 80, it would be off street parking.

1328
02:34:33,794 --> 02:34:37,715
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's my... Paula might have a...

1329
02:34:39,170 --> 02:34:39,931
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's correct.

1330
02:34:39,951 --> 02:34:48,080
[SPEAKER_12]: And then they do this differentiation between half a mile within high transit, frequent transit.

1331
02:34:50,263 --> 02:34:54,628
[SPEAKER_12]: And so in those areas, we're usually outside, so they will ask for one per dwelling unit.

1332
02:34:56,113 --> 02:34:59,774
[SPEAKER_12]: that is the requirement, unless you are within that half a mile.

1333
02:35:00,294 --> 02:35:02,334
[SPEAKER_12]: And that will be only the T stations that we have.

1334
02:35:04,414 --> 02:35:10,155
[SPEAKER_12]: I think maybe some bus lines, but on that further square, I need to look at that.

1335
02:35:11,196 --> 02:35:15,996
[SPEAKER_12]: But only with high transit is within that half a mile is zero requirement.

1336
02:35:16,577 --> 02:35:18,817
[SPEAKER_12]: But for outside, that would be one per 80.

1337
02:35:25,472 --> 02:35:33,619
[SPEAKER_12]: For the protected ADUs, those are by the state law, and we are not planning to go lower than that.

1338
02:35:34,359 --> 02:35:40,644
[SPEAKER_12]: Only for the within half a mile, that would be the zero, but for outside, it's one.

1339
02:35:41,545 --> 02:35:48,791
[SPEAKER_12]: For the local ADUs, we could choose, but I don't think that we will choose to reduce them whenever we are outside that half a mile.

1340
02:35:52,475 --> 02:35:57,556
[SPEAKER_02]: It is within the authority of the city to define the parking mandates.

1341
02:35:57,856 --> 02:35:59,077
[SPEAKER_12]: For the protected ADUs?

1342
02:35:59,437 --> 02:36:00,877
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't be, but we can make it lower.

1343
02:36:03,818 --> 02:36:07,619
[SPEAKER_02]: We can be more permissive, we can't be less permissive, I think is the discussion that we previously had.

1344
02:36:07,699 --> 02:36:08,799
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just wanted to add that.

1345
02:36:08,919 --> 02:36:09,239
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1346
02:36:09,639 --> 02:36:09,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1347
02:36:10,680 --> 02:36:13,540
[SPEAKER_02]: We couldn't say it's two, but we could say it's zero.

1348
02:36:13,581 --> 02:36:14,521
[SPEAKER_09]: Zero, yeah.

1349
02:36:14,561 --> 02:36:15,661
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not putting that forward as an idea.

1350
02:36:15,681 --> 02:36:18,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make sure when we get to the parking that we have the scope of the authority.

1351
02:36:19,773 --> 02:36:20,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1352
02:36:20,974 --> 02:36:21,454
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1353
02:36:21,655 --> 02:36:21,855
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1354
02:36:22,075 --> 02:36:22,295
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1355
02:36:24,077 --> 02:36:24,357
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

1356
02:36:25,418 --> 02:36:26,118
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for the question.

1357
02:36:26,178 --> 02:36:27,039
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for the explanation.

1358
02:36:31,963 --> 02:36:35,706
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you to all members of the public for the thoughtful questions and commentary.

1359
02:36:40,512 --> 02:36:45,734
[SPEAKER_17]: To Emily and Paola, does that give you a clear answer on the additional questions pertaining to local ADUs?

1360
02:36:46,874 --> 02:36:47,114
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

1361
02:36:47,354 --> 02:36:58,918
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that we have, after several weeks, checked every box when it pertains to what decisions to make on the local ADU decisions within our purview then.

1362
02:36:58,978 --> 02:36:59,518
[SPEAKER_17]: That's exciting.

1363
02:37:00,099 --> 02:37:02,219
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you to everybody for all the discussion that's gone into that.

1364
02:37:03,920 --> 02:37:05,540
[SPEAKER_17]: I see no more public participation.

1365
02:37:05,560 --> 02:37:06,821
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll go to Councilor Leming.

1366
02:37:08,730 --> 02:37:25,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Motion to refer the Medford Square, West Medford and ADU rezoning proposals favorably to the regular council meeting for referral to the Community Development Board.

1367
02:37:27,514 --> 02:37:28,034
[SPEAKER_04]: And adjourn.

1368
02:37:29,315 --> 02:37:29,575
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

1369
02:37:39,636 --> 02:37:40,377
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead, President Bears.

1370
02:37:41,258 --> 02:37:47,905
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could just, I was just seconding, and if you could just go to the upcoming meetings before we vote and adjourn.

1371
02:37:48,265 --> 02:37:49,046
[SPEAKER_17]: Absolutely.

1372
02:37:50,707 --> 02:37:52,890
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, looking forward to emphasizing these again.

1373
02:37:53,630 --> 02:37:57,895
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you to Paola for at the beginning of the meeting, running through our upcoming meetings and public Q&As.

1374
02:37:59,136 --> 02:37:59,736
[SPEAKER_17]: timeline.

1375
02:37:59,776 --> 02:38:05,278
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to again emphasize those before we take the vote and move to adjourn.

1376
02:38:06,259 --> 02:38:09,460
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh thank you, I see you're pulling up the slide.

1377
02:38:09,480 --> 02:38:10,621
[SPEAKER_17]: We will get this updated.

1378
02:38:10,661 --> 02:38:13,222
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this is already updated on the zoning website.

1379
02:38:13,282 --> 02:38:15,322
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll make sure that's totally up to date.

1380
02:38:15,423 --> 02:38:23,866
[SPEAKER_17]: So we have added a number of public Q&As to our zoning meetings timeline in addition to our regularly scheduled

1381
02:38:24,748 --> 02:38:28,378
[SPEAKER_17]: planning and permitting committee meetings and CDB public hearings.

1382
02:38:28,458 --> 02:38:29,281
[SPEAKER_17]: So tomorrow,

1383
02:38:31,576 --> 02:38:32,576
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a public Q&A.

1384
02:38:33,216 --> 02:38:35,317
[SPEAKER_17]: It is not germane to this topic that we discussed tonight.

1385
02:38:35,918 --> 02:38:42,401
[SPEAKER_17]: It will be a focus group meeting on Zoom for Tufts institutional zoning.

1386
02:38:44,382 --> 02:38:47,123
[SPEAKER_17]: On Zoom only, Thursday, my first, 7 p.m.

1387
02:38:47,603 --> 02:38:53,586
[SPEAKER_17]: The goal of this meeting is to hear from area residents on what they would like to see for zoning changes to the Tufts University campus.

1388
02:38:53,646 --> 02:38:57,728
[SPEAKER_17]: This is prior to us drafting or workshopping a proposal for this area.

1389
02:38:58,648 --> 02:39:15,112
[SPEAKER_17]: The intent is to hear questions, concerns, suggestions, preferences from the residents in that area before we start crafting a proposal and before we go and begin negotiating an institutional zone with the university.

1390
02:39:15,132 --> 02:39:19,593
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is geared towards Tufts University neighbors, but it is, of course, open to everyone.

1391
02:39:19,673 --> 02:39:21,954
[SPEAKER_17]: And again, that's tomorrow at 7 p.m.

1392
02:39:22,174 --> 02:39:22,634
[SPEAKER_17]: on Zoom.

1393
02:39:22,714 --> 02:39:24,414
[SPEAKER_17]: All details are on the city website.

1394
02:39:28,405 --> 02:39:32,747
[SPEAKER_17]: excuse me, proceeding chronologically on May 7th.

1395
02:39:33,707 --> 02:39:42,191
[SPEAKER_17]: The neighborhood and urban residential proposal will be back at the Community Development Board for a public hearing that was referenced tonight.

1396
02:39:42,211 --> 02:39:44,732
[SPEAKER_17]: I encourage everybody to join.

1397
02:39:45,413 --> 02:39:48,474
[SPEAKER_17]: The CDB public hearings always include public comment.

1398
02:39:48,514 --> 02:39:50,175
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a great opportunity to learn about the proposal.

1399
02:39:50,955 --> 02:39:52,956
[SPEAKER_17]: and to put your opinions on the record.

1400
02:39:53,396 --> 02:40:06,423
[SPEAKER_17]: The following evening, May 8, we'll be having a public Q&A on what we discussed tonight, Medford Square zoning proposal, West Medford Square zoning proposal, and the proposed updates to the ADUs.

1401
02:40:07,103 --> 02:40:07,784
[SPEAKER_17]: regulations.

1402
02:40:08,204 --> 02:40:11,326
[SPEAKER_17]: We will be having that at 6.30 p.m.

1403
02:40:11,366 --> 02:40:14,067
[SPEAKER_17]: at the Andrews Cafetorium, I believe.

1404
02:40:14,327 --> 02:40:15,768
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes.

1405
02:40:16,648 --> 02:40:17,289
[SPEAKER_17]: Everybody's welcome.

1406
02:40:18,209 --> 02:40:20,671
[SPEAKER_17]: Ask questions, hear comments, hear an overview of these proposals again.

1407
02:40:23,072 --> 02:40:25,993
[SPEAKER_17]: And just to restate in case anybody is new to this process.

1408
02:40:26,613 --> 02:40:41,918
[SPEAKER_17]: Now that this well, assuming that the vote goes favorably now that this proposal will be reported out of committee, it will be referred to the city council where it will be immediately referred to the Community Development Board, all zoning amendments updates or new zoning.

1409
02:40:43,238 --> 02:40:53,265
[SPEAKER_17]: After being workshopped in committee, procedurally have to be referred to the CBB for a public hearing before they may be referred back to the City Council, where we will take the final vote to ordain.

1410
02:40:54,246 --> 02:40:58,129
[SPEAKER_17]: So this is kind of the end of the beginning for a zoning proposal.

1411
02:40:58,529 --> 02:41:01,832
[SPEAKER_17]: There's a lot of opportunities for public comment and learning still to come.

1412
02:41:01,892 --> 02:41:05,855
[SPEAKER_17]: And we hope that anybody who's interested will participate in as many of them as they like.

1413
02:41:06,415 --> 02:41:11,679
[SPEAKER_17]: So all of these upcoming meetings can be found at medfordma.org slash zoning.

1414
02:41:15,487 --> 02:41:16,528
[SPEAKER_17]: Did I miss any important dates?

1415
02:41:17,088 --> 02:41:17,568
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think so.

1416
02:41:19,450 --> 02:41:19,610
[SPEAKER_17]: Great.

1417
02:41:21,171 --> 02:41:21,891
[SPEAKER_17]: Go ahead, President Burrs.

1418
02:41:22,672 --> 02:41:22,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks.

1419
02:41:22,952 --> 02:41:24,793
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had one request.

1420
02:41:25,473 --> 02:41:26,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I know we make a lot of requests of you.

1421
02:41:28,235 --> 02:41:29,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Could we do a May and June

1422
02:41:30,164 --> 02:41:30,744
[SPEAKER_02]: version of this.

1423
02:41:31,024 --> 02:41:33,745
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, this is great slide to show everything that's happened before.

1424
02:41:34,305 --> 02:41:35,786
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're getting crowded.

1425
02:41:37,627 --> 02:41:39,447
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe we should make all the text smaller.

1426
02:41:39,807 --> 02:41:41,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

1427
02:41:41,408 --> 02:41:41,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

1428
02:41:42,608 --> 02:41:44,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just the going forward, I think would be helpful.

1429
02:41:44,829 --> 02:41:46,510
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can get that up on the zoning website.

1430
02:41:46,590 --> 02:41:53,232
[SPEAKER_02]: And in addition to people seeing all the things we've done up to this point, but we have a lot.

1431
02:41:54,100 --> 02:41:55,601
[SPEAKER_02]: And we don't even have the June dates on there.

1432
02:41:55,942 --> 02:42:00,226
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the council, for this committee and the council.

1433
02:42:00,246 --> 02:42:01,126
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

1434
02:42:03,577 --> 02:42:04,997
[SPEAKER_17]: I will work with Ennis to get that updated.

1435
02:42:05,037 --> 02:42:06,078
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for the suggestion.

1436
02:42:06,658 --> 02:42:24,661
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, so on the motion by Councilor Leming to report the Medford Square zoning proposal, West Medford Square zoning proposal and proposed updates to the ADU ordinance to a regular meeting of the City Council for referral to Community Development Board, seconded by President Bears.

1437
02:42:26,262 --> 02:42:28,342
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please, and adjourn.

1438

[SPEAKER_17]: When you're ready, please call the roll.

1439
02:42:30,322 --> 02:42:32,623
[SPEAKER_06]: And Councilor Scarpelli just informed me he had to leave, so.

1440
02:42:33,923 --> 02:42:36,366
[SPEAKER_06]: He's he just left, but he's no, I'm sorry.
