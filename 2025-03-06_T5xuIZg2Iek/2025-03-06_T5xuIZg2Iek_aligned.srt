1
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:57,759
door to my office to do this meeting.

2
00:08:59,201 --> 00:09:05,370
But if you guys need me, come on in.

3
00:09:06,592 --> 00:09:07,012
Probably.

4
00:09:07,032 --> 00:09:10,757
Yeah, you can lock, I mean, we can leave.

5
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,360
All right, thanks.

6
00:11:57,107 --> 00:11:59,529
Hi there, could you give me just like two, three minutes?

7
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:01,932
Sure, yeah.

8
00:12:03,013 --> 00:12:03,273
Thanks.

9
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:56,412
So clearly everybody's here to watch the adventurous process of editing a newsletter.

10
00:12:56,432 --> 00:13:00,400
I think that's why we're all here today.

11
00:16:26,926 --> 00:16:29,107
Councilor saying just let us know when you're ready.

12
00:16:31,288 --> 00:16:31,489
Good.

13
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:35,251
Okay.

14
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:46,138
Welcome to a meeting of the Resident Services and Public Engagement Committee meeting being held today solely on Zoom.

15
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:54,443
We have, Mr. Clerk, I keep forgetting, for Zoom only meetings, there's a roll call necessary.

16
00:16:56,277 --> 00:16:57,258
Zoom only committee meetings.

17
00:16:57,478 --> 00:16:58,799
Yes, a roll call is necessary.

18
00:16:59,599 --> 00:17:01,601
Please call the roll when you're ready.

19
00:17:06,244 --> 00:17:07,005
Councilor Callahan.

20
00:17:07,805 --> 00:17:08,166
Present.

21
00:17:11,268 --> 00:17:12,189
Councilor Lozaro.

22
00:17:17,953 --> 00:17:18,253
Unmute.

23
00:17:23,972 --> 00:17:27,355
think you might need to make Councilor Lozaro a co-host.

24
00:17:28,035 --> 00:17:30,277
She needs to be made a co-host.

25
00:17:31,298 --> 00:17:32,079
Hang on, I got her now.

26
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:34,081
Thank you.

27
00:17:40,446 --> 00:17:41,267
Councilor Scarpelli?

28
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,731
Councilor Seng and Chair Lemming?

29
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:47,052
Present.

30
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,351
Present, four present, one absent.

31
00:17:51,811 --> 00:17:53,771
The meeting is called to order.

32
00:17:53,851 --> 00:17:58,932
We have three items on the agenda today.

33
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:05,774
A resolution to discuss a modernization of the Human Rights Commission's enabling ordinance, which we'll do first.

34
00:18:05,814 --> 00:18:12,496
It will be followed by a resolution to discuss council listening sessions in which we'll

35
00:18:13,556 --> 00:18:24,082
offer updates, reports of some of the recent listening sessions, particularly at the Senior Center, and then we'll work on publishing the newsletter.

36
00:18:24,502 --> 00:18:32,627
So we'll start with the Human Rights Commission's enabling ordinance, and I'll hand it off to Councillor Tsang.

37
00:18:34,169 --> 00:18:35,210
Thank you chair lemming.

38
00:18:35,571 --> 00:18:43,980
Um, let me start again by just generally framing what we're trying to do here, give a little bit of context for where we are now.

39
00:18:44,981 --> 00:18:53,290
And then I can walk through the draft changes, the new draft that I had circulated to the other members of this committee last week.

40
00:18:55,612 --> 00:19:06,321
So essentially, this starts with reappraising where, you know, the type of work we're doing in our city when it comes to social justice, civil rights, human rights.

41
00:19:08,603 --> 00:19:17,151
And something that I heard from former committee members of the HRC and sitting commissioners was that

42
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:43,590
was that essentially the original enabling ordinance hamstrung them so that they couldn't meet quorum to meet, they couldn't do a number of things that I think other cities very normally do within their HRC powers that our city hasn't done because we haven't reviewed or revised this ordinance substantively in such a long time.

43
00:19:44,330 --> 00:20:13,837
And so I've been working over the last few months, it's getting close to a year, with members of the community who have experience on the HRC, members of the community who have experience in the field of advocating for social justice issues, and also working with members of the current HRC to draft an ordinance that makes our HRC more functional again.

44
00:20:15,677 --> 00:20:24,160
The most recent updates is that the HRC hasn't been able to make a quorum for the last few months, so the HRC just hasn't been meeting.

45
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:39,063
Furthermore, Francis Noage, the RDEI director, has resigned as liaison to the HRC as well, and so there's no city staff member who is there to

46
00:20:41,944 --> 00:20:43,585
help the HRC get off the ground.

47
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:51,368
And I think that really underscores the need for us to pass an updated HRC ordinance as soon as we can.

48
00:20:52,468 --> 00:21:03,793
I've been working with members of the city administration in the last few months as well to hear from them about what changes they'd like to see the ordinance and negotiating with them on that front.

49
00:21:05,053 --> 00:21:23,300
and also continuing to work with community members to make sure that the proposed changes are in alignment with what members of the HRC and former members of the HRC would want to make sure that this ordinance gives them the ability to do that.

50
00:21:24,897 --> 00:21:31,521
With that being said, I think my goals for this meeting is to get our committee generally behind a document.

51
00:21:32,341 --> 00:21:36,924
I'm slated to meet with the mayor soon to discuss this ordinance further.

52
00:21:36,944 --> 00:21:41,866
I think my goal, to be transparent, would be to get something out of this committee by next month.

53
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:50,731
And so that's why I'd like to get us on the same page about these edits that we've made over the last few months together first.

54
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:59,157
Before I go into the document itself, are there any comments from councillors?

55
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:04,862
Seeing none, oh, yep.

56
00:22:05,342 --> 00:22:07,003
That's my job too.

57
00:22:07,184 --> 00:22:08,445
Sorry, I just.

58
00:22:08,505 --> 00:22:14,329
Yeah, are there any comments from councillors?

59
00:22:14,369 --> 00:22:15,150
Councillor Lozaro.

60
00:22:17,682 --> 00:22:18,022
Thank you.

61
00:22:18,082 --> 00:22:21,825
I just want to say thank you, Councillor Singh, for doing this work.

62
00:22:21,885 --> 00:22:36,237
It's important that we go over these kinds of issues with our commission so that we make sure that anything that's getting in the way of our commissions being able to gather is remedied when we notice it.

63
00:22:36,397 --> 00:22:37,398
So I appreciate it.

64
00:22:37,418 --> 00:22:37,739
Thank you.

65
00:22:41,081 --> 00:22:41,822
Any other councillors?

66
00:22:45,484 --> 00:22:52,231
I just like to thank Councilor Sang as well as our wonderful community advocates for working on this.

67
00:22:52,251 --> 00:22:57,436
Feel free to go over the edits as you please, Councilor.

68
00:22:58,377 --> 00:22:58,737
Thank you.

69
00:22:58,757 --> 00:23:01,120
A lot of these edits

70
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:09,143
A lot of these edits are somewhat technical, but there are some substantive edits as well.

71
00:23:11,044 --> 00:23:23,191
So, as you can see in the establishment and purposes section, these are kind of more technical edits to make sure that we are including, to make sure that we're including parts of the,

72
00:23:25,432 --> 00:23:31,639
Like, every sector of the community that we can think of, and to make sure that this language is tighter as well and more inclusive.

73
00:23:33,081 --> 00:23:35,984
So that's technical with regards.

74
00:23:36,004 --> 00:23:45,215
1 of the big conversations that members of the city administration community advocates and I have been having is about the size of the.

75
00:23:47,854 --> 00:23:50,075
and the previously proposed size.

76
00:23:50,655 --> 00:24:12,348
So previously the ordinance language read for the HRC to have 12 to 18 members and a few, Francis brought this up as well as a number of current HRC members bringing up the worry that this might be too big of a size and if we set a lower bound of 12,

77
00:24:13,849 --> 00:24:20,574
We might have a period of time where we aren't able to have the HRC meet because we haven't appointed up to 12 people yet.

78
00:24:21,996 --> 00:24:33,623
We had, the community advocates and I have had a very long and extensive discussion about it because we want to make sure that there are as many voices as possible on the HRC.

79
00:24:34,903 --> 00:24:42,787
The size here is, you know, there's a benefit to having a higher number so we have a diversity of voices, I think.

80
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:49,351
The if we read the purposes and you know the powers and duties of HRC in this ordinance.

81
00:24:49,851 --> 00:24:53,893
It's much more expansive than the current current ordinances.

82
00:24:53,973 --> 00:24:59,295
And so the idea is having more people would help HRC get more stuff done as well.

83
00:24:59,796 --> 00:25:01,677
But then we also have to balance that with

84
00:25:03,766 --> 00:25:05,868
with the practical concerns too.

85
00:25:07,469 --> 00:25:12,714
It was suggested to me from Francis that we do nine to 12 members.

86
00:25:14,216 --> 00:25:25,647
In this draft, I think generally, I think nine to 15 makes sense to retain a lot of the flexibility that we initially wanted.

87
00:25:27,087 --> 00:25:39,151
And, you know, if it gets to a point where 15 is unworkable, I think there's flexibility there to keep the slots open, but I think it's worth trying to get more members too.

88
00:25:41,732 --> 00:25:43,133
So with that change,

89
00:25:45,531 --> 00:25:51,855
we have basically reconfigured the appointment system as well to make it more even.

90
00:25:52,436 --> 00:25:59,821
Basically, a third being the mayor, a third being the city council, and then appointing from different community groups.

91
00:26:00,081 --> 00:26:11,348
And this is something that was also in the last draft, but to explain this again, since it's been a few months, the idea I think is for, you know,

92
00:26:12,569 --> 00:26:31,914
I think the idea is that we would have members of different commissions that aren't the HRC but have interests in the HRC, where the work overlaps also sit on the HRC, to help facilitate cross-commission, cross-department, cross-organizational cooperation as well.

93
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:39,161
I know something that we have been talking about is potentially deleting this because we don't really need it.

94
00:26:40,623 --> 00:26:45,028
And I think that's probably a decent recommendation, although we can talk about that later.

95
00:26:46,429 --> 00:26:53,036
Another edit that we made to this section is in section B. So essentially,

96
00:26:54,913 --> 00:27:02,859
Before the language read, no more than half should be of any one gender or racial identity.

97
00:27:03,339 --> 00:27:12,505
We changed it to 60% for functionality, just because it's hard to guarantee half or less.

98
00:27:12,685 --> 00:27:19,990
And so this gives us a little bit of wiggle room while still maintaining the spirit and the purpose of the original text.

99
00:27:24,407 --> 00:27:39,314
And here, this is an adjustment to respond to the original, like the change in section A. In section E, we have clarified some language here about reimbursements.

100
00:27:40,714 --> 00:27:50,059
We had a good conversation about how there are, number one, we should clarify that this is that

101
00:27:54,698 --> 00:27:56,420
Sorry, I can't speak.

102
00:27:56,681 --> 00:28:10,518
We should clarify that HRC commissioners who are spending their money on top of a stipend or whatever, if they're spending their personal money on getting a project done, they should be

103
00:28:11,934 --> 00:28:15,917
The this ordinance should allow them to get compensation for that as well.

104
00:28:16,397 --> 00:28:25,403
So I think a concrete example is if someone is buying, you know, posters for a community event to let them know about their rights, right?

105
00:28:26,103 --> 00:28:31,887
I know your rights event, then they should be able to be compensated for printing those posters in the first place.

106
00:28:31,927 --> 00:28:33,148
And I think that's really standard.

107
00:28:34,068 --> 00:28:34,708
custom as well.

108
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:45,952
And we believe that that should extend to volunteers as well, just to make sure that they're being compensated for their time, effort, their money being spent.

109
00:28:47,012 --> 00:28:50,733
And I think it's important to put that put this in.

110
00:28:50,853 --> 00:28:54,675
I've been talking to some people who are more legally trained than I am.

111
00:28:54,915 --> 00:29:01,557
And the idea is if we don't put this language in, then it actually might sound very restrictive.

112
00:29:02,437 --> 00:29:19,425
And then the last edit to this section, as it stands right now, is just some clarification on the training that HRC members should receive.

113
00:29:20,786 --> 00:29:26,389
There is some surplus language, I believe, especially in addition to later in the ordinance.

114
00:29:26,589 --> 00:29:28,430
So that's what that is.

115
00:29:29,797 --> 00:29:43,207
We've broken, upon the recommendation, I believe this is of a few people, a few, this is from a few community members, current HRC members, from Francis as well.

116
00:29:44,388 --> 00:29:48,811
There's the recommendation that we should clarify a little bit what the officer's roles are.

117
00:29:48,892 --> 00:29:53,155
So the original ordinance did put in that there should be a chair, a vice chair, and a clerk.

118
00:29:54,476 --> 00:29:58,058
And as we saw during charter review, this is becoming more standard.

119
00:29:58,879 --> 00:30:12,049
As we also saw during charter review, our charter review conversations, for us to be able to have that flexibility in terms of how a commission is structured, we need to talk about it a little bit more in ordinance.

120
00:30:12,569 --> 00:30:18,554
So I actually grabbed the language for most of this section from the draft charter.

121
00:30:20,595 --> 00:30:32,381
So, you know, this is like quite standard vetted language it aligns with like the draft city charter, but then there's some more clarification as well as well as customization for the HRC.

122
00:30:35,728 --> 00:30:47,475
I, because it's not very standard to have a treasurer for, well, it's not very, it's not always common for a treasurer to be an officer in a commission.

123
00:30:48,456 --> 00:30:56,801
I've put the financial procedure aspects, the finance aspects under a joint responsibility of the officers.

124
00:30:56,961 --> 00:31:00,803
I think that's something, if this committee has different views on, we can talk about it.

125
00:31:03,105 --> 00:31:06,207
Cool.

126
00:31:06,528 --> 00:31:13,734
Another change that was suggested that we make was reducing the minimum number of meetings from 10 meetings to 8 meetings.

127
00:31:14,254 --> 00:31:19,198
The intention isn't for us to have fewer meetings, but the intention is to give us more flexibility.

128
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,221
Legal wiggle room, essentially.

129
00:31:23,743 --> 00:31:28,269
I suspect this will be a big conversation tonight as well.

130
00:31:32,454 --> 00:31:41,865
Essentially, the administration has recommended that we adjust the language in section, subsection A here about legal counsel.

131
00:31:42,645 --> 00:31:52,674
from if the city has no solicitor, the commission shall be provided adequate funding to retain its own, to the commission should have adequate access to council.

132
00:31:53,595 --> 00:32:00,020
Because this is something I think we might be talking about a bit tonight, I just wanted to highlight the two arguments.

133
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:05,424
So the argument for keeping it as it was before, so the original language,

134
00:32:06,165 --> 00:32:17,494
is that a lot of the work that the HRC might be doing might not always be in the interests, completely aligned with the interests of the city administration.

135
00:32:18,334 --> 00:32:29,083
And so it makes some sense for the HRC to retain its own council in those instances so they can get more honest feedback.

136
00:32:29,843 --> 00:32:31,004
and legal advice.

137
00:32:31,725 --> 00:32:45,777
The counter to that is a worry from the administration that in general, it's not recommended practice for different parts of the municipal government to be having different legal representation.

138
00:32:47,078 --> 00:32:50,381
And there's a worry about the legal consequences of that as well.

139
00:32:51,262 --> 00:32:55,005
And it is not exactly, not very standard for that.

140
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:04,845
And then in the last section, the only real edit is to broaden B1 from discuss to review and discuss.

141
00:33:14,288 --> 00:33:40,158
This is just to essentially give the HRC the power to look at city policy as it stands, and to engage with city bodies in that sense, to be able to work with them to review human rights problems, and not just talk about it in a vacuum.

142
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:46,181
Um, so with that being said, that's basically all the edits I, um, I've had.

143
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:53,823
Um, I want to open this up, um, and hear feedback from counselors and from residents.

144
00:33:54,723 --> 00:33:58,444
Uh, one, uh, could he, could he go, could you, uh, present your screen again?

145
00:33:58,484 --> 00:34:00,785
Yeah, actually I can, I can also just keep this up.

146
00:34:01,745 --> 00:34:03,786
Um, that might be it.

147
00:34:03,826 --> 00:34:06,546
It didn't say human rights problem issues.

148
00:34:06,686 --> 00:34:08,807
Like, yeah, I also just noticed that we can,

149
00:34:10,226 --> 00:34:12,307
I think it's meant to read that.

150
00:34:12,727 --> 00:34:13,928
Okay, gotcha.

151
00:34:14,788 --> 00:34:15,108
Thank you.

152
00:34:15,128 --> 00:34:20,570
Is there any- And I would actually suggest putting civil rights in there too.

153
00:34:26,353 --> 00:34:30,935
Just the view right now, because sometimes human rights and civil rights are slightly different.

154
00:34:31,155 --> 00:34:34,456
So I wanna make sure that we're catching as much as possible.

155
00:34:34,936 --> 00:34:35,276
Gotcha.

156
00:34:35,977 --> 00:34:36,657
Councilor Callahan.

157
00:34:39,022 --> 00:34:39,682
Hey there.

158
00:34:39,922 --> 00:34:46,185
So thanks so much for all the work that you've done and all the folks you've talked to and everything that's, you know, I know there's a lot going into this.

159
00:34:47,326 --> 00:34:55,570
I had a question as I'm looking over the roles, powers and duties, and please tell me if I'm misreading this, but it does look like

160
00:34:57,373 --> 00:35:13,894
The, the four essential roles are all related to Medford specifically and I just know from some of the folks I've talked to that they felt that their hands were tied and they were told they were not allowed to discuss human rights, anywhere outside the city.

161
00:35:14,515 --> 00:35:26,081
So I just, I wanted to raise that and see what you think as the person working on this document, if you've had those kinds of discussions, you know, maybe I'm wrong and that's, you know, that's not what this does.

162
00:35:26,241 --> 00:35:29,022
So I would just love to get your feedback on that, just Councillor Tang.

163
00:35:30,023 --> 00:35:35,505
Yeah, I think that's a good point.

164
00:35:35,645 --> 00:35:45,227
I mean, I know when we were crafting it, at least it wasn't my intention that we limit it to Medford.

165
00:35:45,267 --> 00:35:47,348
Obviously, I think the focus should be Medford.

166
00:35:47,808 --> 00:35:53,890
But there have been a number of cases in the last year where the Human Rights Commission wants

167
00:35:55,550 --> 00:36:01,194
really, you know, uh, talk about issues happening outside of our city as well.

168
00:36:01,394 --> 00:36:04,135
And I think oftentimes the boundaries are really muddy, right?

169
00:36:04,256 --> 00:36:10,980
Oftentimes as we've articulated on the council before too, sometimes oftentimes human rights issues actually have effects here in Medford too.

170
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:16,703
So maybe there's something, um, some changes that we can make in this section to broaden it a little bit.

171
00:36:17,204 --> 00:36:21,426
I don't think anything in this section necessarily precludes those conversations.

172
00:36:22,227 --> 00:36:22,927
Um, but I, um,

173
00:36:25,953 --> 00:36:31,356
because of this part, but perhaps there's some places where we can delete the words in Medford.

174
00:36:32,636 --> 00:36:52,546
I was actually just thinking, instead of deleting the words in Medford, I think it is appropriate that it be about Medford, but I think maybe there could be a, you know, letter E or something that is, you know, sort of, I don't know how to phrase this, but like an outlet for discussion of,

175
00:36:55,070 --> 00:37:00,436
human rights issues that affect the people of Medford, even if those issues are not occurring in Medford.

176
00:37:02,017 --> 00:37:15,391
Because there are, you know, I mean, look, just thinking about the, you know, the great desire here in Medford for a ceasefire earlier last year, that there were many families here who were directly

177
00:37:16,113 --> 00:37:19,656
affected, directly affected by what was happening abroad.

178
00:37:20,217 --> 00:37:34,109
So I think at least the ability for them to discuss those things and to be a place where people in Medford can go to raise issues of human rights that are affecting them personally.

179
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:37,592
I don't know how to phrase it, but I think having that as, you know,

180
00:37:38,995 --> 00:37:46,559
one thing that they are explicitly allowed to discuss, I think might be a benefit, but I'm open to people's opinions as well.

181
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:55,784
Yeah, I think that this is something maybe we can discuss as a committee and also to hear from the public.

182
00:37:56,405 --> 00:38:08,351
I do like what you're saying, and I actually quite liked how you put it earlier, providing the forum to discuss those issues and pending conversation, maybe we can draft some language on that.

183
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,002
Great, thank you.

184
00:38:11,983 --> 00:38:25,086
And I did have one other question if I may, and that's about the question of whether the city solicitor is the council or the commission has access to other council.

185
00:38:25,366 --> 00:38:33,108
I mean, I'm inclined without hearing more about it, I'm sort of inclined to,

186
00:38:34,622 --> 00:38:40,825
say that it probably should be the city solicitor or the council of the city because they are a commission of the city.

187
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:46,588
But I would be interested in understanding a little bit more at least of how that would be paid for.

188
00:38:46,828 --> 00:38:53,691
I mean, anyone can go and find another lawyer that they happen to know or get some advice from somebody else, that's fine.

189
00:38:54,452 --> 00:39:02,716
But if we're talking about it being like paid legal counsel, I would wanna have some idea of where that funding is coming from.

190
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:06,060
I think that's a good, good question.

191
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:24,390
I think the way I was thinking about it, and I'm curious to hear other, you know, voices in this Zoom meeting about this, the way I was thinking about it is that it would function somewhat like when, like when PDS

192
00:39:25,052 --> 00:39:32,237
you know, when they're working on something, a development project or something, they sometimes get advice from KP law.

193
00:39:32,277 --> 00:39:36,840
So, and I believe that comes out of the legal budget and not the PDS budget.

194
00:39:37,501 --> 00:39:41,704
So that's how I was thinking about it, the city providing that.

195
00:39:41,744 --> 00:39:47,568
And I actually think the language of this ordinance would provide that reading in my opinion.

196
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:51,551
So because the part about the budget line for the MHRC,

197
00:39:54,746 --> 00:39:57,227
is about accomplishing its purposes.

198
00:39:57,947 --> 00:39:59,328
So roles, powers, duties.

199
00:39:59,668 --> 00:40:09,372
I think that probably, essentially, I think this stuff in this section is what their own budget will handle.

200
00:40:09,672 --> 00:40:12,253
And I think this falls outside of it.

201
00:40:12,693 --> 00:40:13,694
That's my reading.

202
00:40:13,754 --> 00:40:17,515
But we can also maybe get a wording that's a little bit tighter on that.

203
00:40:19,615 --> 00:40:22,980
Yeah, I'm curious to hear what people think.

204
00:40:24,141 --> 00:40:35,817
I think with regards to the city solicitor part, this first sentence essentially says that when there is a city solicitor, they should serve as the counsel of the commission.

205
00:40:37,078 --> 00:40:39,399
The difference obviously is, I guess, in the second part.

206
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:49,884
When the city has no solicitors, the original one is just very directly saying, if the city has no solicitor, they should retain their own legal counsel.

207
00:40:50,625 --> 00:41:00,109
And the new version, this was suggested to me by the administration, is just to have adequate access to counsel.

208
00:41:00,129 --> 00:41:03,091
So that guarantees that they'll have legal counsel.

209
00:41:06,112 --> 00:41:11,474
It doesn't say anything about, um, making that they're, you know, the HRC's own legal counsel.

210
00:41:15,176 --> 00:41:19,018
Okay, so your hand is still raised.

211
00:41:19,678 --> 00:41:20,358
Okay.

212
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:23,379
Okay.

213
00:41:26,021 --> 00:41:26,601
I saw that.

214
00:41:28,006 --> 00:41:32,587
Barry's hand was raised to add a comment.

215
00:41:33,307 --> 00:41:35,668
So we'll move on to public participation.

216
00:41:35,828 --> 00:41:40,129
Barry, you've put your hand up and down once or twice.

217
00:41:40,649 --> 00:41:42,890
Do you still want to speak?

218
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:50,331
All right, I've asked you done.

219
00:41:50,391 --> 00:41:56,173
Yeah, I'll have a comment later, but I just want to

220
00:41:57,462 --> 00:42:02,884
answer Councillor Callahan's question about non-Medford issues.

221
00:42:02,904 --> 00:42:19,151
Item C does read, the MHRC shall be empowered to advocate for laws, policies, and practices that support human rights and improve social equity in Medford and at the state and federal levels.

222
00:42:20,652 --> 00:42:21,192
So it

223
00:42:23,058 --> 00:42:31,643
It is in there, whether it's there to the extent that people would like is something else, but just to say it's in there.

224
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:32,903
I apologize.

225
00:42:33,024 --> 00:42:34,164
Would you mind telling me where that is?

226
00:42:34,204 --> 00:42:34,704
I'm looking for it.

227
00:42:35,165 --> 00:42:37,946
It's the first sentence in C. Thank you.

228
00:42:39,067 --> 00:42:40,248
The last sentence in C, right?

229
00:42:41,028 --> 00:42:47,211
First sentence in C. The first sentence is state and federal.

230
00:42:48,072 --> 00:42:48,312
Thank you.

231
00:42:54,483 --> 00:42:59,265
All right.

232
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:01,945
Go back to the thing about the legal counsel.

233
00:43:06,227 --> 00:43:12,549
So could you expand on

234
00:43:15,137 --> 00:43:22,025
Did the mayor, when you talked to her, provide any justification on the usual interpretation of that kind of language?

235
00:43:22,045 --> 00:43:31,515
Because I know that when lawyers suggest language, it's often the case that it's been used elsewhere in other contexts.

236
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:35,139
So does this imply that in certain cases,

237
00:43:37,178 --> 00:43:48,470
HRC can retain its own legal counsel or what was kind of your or does it does it imply that if there's a city solicitor that's readily available, then they wouldn't be allowed to do that.

238
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:48,810
Can you.

239
00:43:50,948 --> 00:43:55,431
Did those conversations offer any additional context around this writing?

240
00:43:56,291 --> 00:44:02,595
So on this part, the mayor wasn't the one to suggest this part.

241
00:44:03,636 --> 00:44:05,977
This came from the DEI department.

242
00:44:08,619 --> 00:44:09,800
I mean, I think it's how you read it.

243
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:15,383
And what we talk about in this committee will actually shape how courts will read it.

244
00:44:19,111 --> 00:44:24,173
I, the way I would read it is that this language is generally broad.

245
00:44:25,294 --> 00:44:46,142
Um, so essentially just saying that they have to have some access to council, but I think the language that is suggested in this new updated version would basically give that authority to the mayor's office to decide, um, where the, whether the council they get is KP law or whether the council they get is someone else.

246
00:44:47,342 --> 00:44:48,223
Um, whereas

247
00:44:49,305 --> 00:45:03,012
this original language that wasn't there before, the way I read it is the commission should be the one to decide who to, you know, who to serve as council when there's no city solicitor.

248
00:45:03,573 --> 00:45:04,773
So it's like an agency thing.

249
00:45:10,777 --> 00:45:11,457
Councilor Cotland?

250
00:45:14,965 --> 00:45:17,907
Thanks, I just wanted to chime in and thank Faringer.

251
00:45:18,547 --> 00:45:24,131
I read that whole part and I believe that you're quite correct that that we're already covered.

252
00:45:24,191 --> 00:45:28,073
So Councilor Sang, no need to add anything.

253
00:45:28,133 --> 00:45:29,834
I think that language covers, thank you.

254
00:45:30,535 --> 00:45:30,875
Great.

255
00:45:34,377 --> 00:45:41,221
Is there any other members of the public who would like to speak?

256
00:45:45,768 --> 00:45:49,131
just if you would feel free to raise your hand on Zoom.

257
00:45:57,577 --> 00:46:05,363
Great, we will, David Harris, I'm gonna ask you to unmute.

258
00:46:05,504 --> 00:46:07,105
Thank you and good evening, everyone.

259
00:46:07,125 --> 00:46:08,126
I'm glad to be here.

260
00:46:08,246 --> 00:46:09,827
I'm very thankful for the opportunity.

261
00:46:09,847 --> 00:46:10,848
My name is David Harris.

262
00:46:11,028 --> 00:46:13,150
I live at 151 Sharon Street, West Medford.

263
00:46:14,515 --> 00:46:17,638
I was a member of the Human Rights Commission from 1999 to 2015.

264
00:46:17,678 --> 00:46:18,599
I chaired it from 2002 to 2015.

265
00:46:25,756 --> 00:46:33,602
During that time, I just wanted to share some thoughts about that time and why I enthusiastically support these changes.

266
00:46:34,462 --> 00:46:42,588
We had a great deal of difficulty making connections to the community members and actually understanding what our mission was.

267
00:46:42,868 --> 00:46:46,811
I remember being, my own recruitment was fairly informal.

268
00:46:46,831 --> 00:46:51,515
There was little vetting and the same thing happened for others throughout my tenure.

269
00:46:52,515 --> 00:47:03,856
I had a background in civil rights and racial justice, so I didn't really doubt that I belonged there, but it was a fairly informal process, and I think it could be better.

270
00:47:05,208 --> 00:47:19,438
And over the course of the time that I was with the commission, the city became increasingly diverse and the need for a kind of viable, active and productive organization increased, but our capacity to do so didn't.

271
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:29,965
So despite that growth, HRC continued to operate in a kind of ad hoc fashion, which didn't really serve the city well.

272
00:47:31,702 --> 00:47:43,180
I also remember being part of the MHRC, the Mass Association of Human Rights Commission, whose meetings were held here at City Hall, and Diane McLeod really drove that organization.

273
00:47:43,792 --> 00:48:05,142
And I remember being in those meetings and kind of feeling the difference between, you know, Medford's ordinance, the way we operated and what other cities had and did, and feeling a little bit envious and thinking that we needed to actually make some changes to the way we operated.

274
00:48:05,162 --> 00:48:07,043
I always wish we could do more.

275
00:48:08,399 --> 00:48:15,123
So I basically think that this proposal, this is a clearer, more concise and detailed mandate and authority.

276
00:48:15,404 --> 00:48:19,706
It's certainly fitting and due and could serve us well.

277
00:48:22,168 --> 00:48:32,214
So, and I also think that as we think about kind of making Medford a more welcoming place, these changes can actually help us meet that goal.

278
00:48:32,995 --> 00:48:36,457
The HRC should be a key tool for that.

279
00:48:38,451 --> 00:48:45,916
And so I think a clear mandate would be really great, and I enthusiastically support this.

280
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:47,798
I'd be glad to say any more if people have questions.

281
00:48:48,799 --> 00:48:58,266
My last thing, I'd like to thank all the other volunteers who worked on this, and I came late.

282
00:49:00,347 --> 00:49:08,450
I really do think that we, as a city, owe a debt of gratitude to the folks who put this together and to you, Councillor Sands.

283
00:49:08,970 --> 00:49:09,330
Thank you.

284
00:49:11,951 --> 00:49:12,391
Thank you.

285
00:49:13,491 --> 00:49:15,892
Munir Jermanes is next.

286
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:17,153
I'm going to ask you to unmute.

287
00:49:20,734 --> 00:49:21,114
Thank you.

288
00:49:21,934 --> 00:49:24,455
Yeah, my name is Munir Jamanis.

289
00:49:24,635 --> 00:49:30,716
I'm going to give just a little background as to how this came about.

290
00:49:32,957 --> 00:49:42,599
I was a member of the Human Rights Commission between 2017 and 2022 and served for approximately four years as its chair.

291
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:44,280
In the fall of 2021,

292
00:49:46,858 --> 00:50:05,884
The HRC formed a subcommittee to generate a strategic plan for better definition of the role of the HRC, since the existing ordinance was outdated and did not really describe fully the role and responsibilities of the Human Rights Commission.

293
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:20,224
Soon afterwards, the HRC decided to disband this subcommittee and accepted an offer from Safe Medford to establish an ad hoc committee to assess the effectiveness of the HRC.

294
00:50:21,161 --> 00:50:23,383
and to provide some recommendations.

295
00:50:24,343 --> 00:50:48,060
The committee included three HRC members and they reviewed the role and operations of the HRC and provided a report to the HRC suggesting ways that the commission can become more effective in promoting and defending human rights in Medford.

296
00:50:49,167 --> 00:51:06,741
The committee conducted several dozen interviews, current and past HRC stakeholders, looked at the mission, goals, and activities of human rights commissions in nearby cities and towns, and reviewed the ordinance that established the Medford HRC.

297
00:51:08,202 --> 00:51:17,810
Then the committee discussed and agreed upon a set of recommendations regarding goals and roles of the HRC and operating guidelines for their implementation.

298
00:51:19,403 --> 00:51:25,408
our hopes were to see a newly robust representative and independent HRC.

299
00:51:26,049 --> 00:51:47,667
Now, in the course of its work and discussions, the committee concluded that to a significant extent, the HRC has been hampered by its current enabling ordinance, which fails to provide the HRC with the resources and independence that it would need in order to carry out its mandate.

300
00:51:48,902 --> 00:52:08,507
The idea was the reform of the HRC would involve a new, carefully written ordinance that clearly outlines the HRC composition, roles, and responsibilities, and would provide the HRC with the independence and resources required to fulfill these responsibilities.

301
00:52:11,465 --> 00:52:30,901
Now, subsequently, another smaller group got together and worked with Councilor Ceng and generated this written ordinance, this proposed ordinance, which you are considering.

302
00:52:32,228 --> 00:52:47,152
Um, and, uh, we, I, I, I myself, I'm sure as other members of this small group, uh, would urge the city council to fully adopt this ordinance with whatever edits they see needed.

303
00:52:47,932 --> 00:52:48,653
Thanks very much.

304
00:52:52,374 --> 00:52:52,894
Thank you.

305
00:52:52,914 --> 00:52:52,954
Um,

306
00:52:54,711 --> 00:52:59,194
I'm also not sure if I was, I don't think I was asking folks to name an address for the record.

307
00:52:59,214 --> 00:53:00,455
Oh, I'm sorry.

308
00:53:01,496 --> 00:53:02,556
Munir Germanus.

309
00:53:02,857 --> 00:53:05,578
I live at 3 Summit Road in Medford.

310
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:06,419
Thank you.

311
00:53:08,801 --> 00:53:10,862
And Adam, did you get, did you get it for David?

312
00:53:15,477 --> 00:53:16,477
Yes, chairman.

313
00:53:16,777 --> 00:53:18,518
Mr Harris actually provided his address.

314
00:53:18,598 --> 00:53:18,998
Okay.

315
00:53:19,458 --> 00:53:23,280
And I had Mr Jim and this is from from his previous testimony and other committees.

316
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:24,180
Gotcha.

317
00:53:24,220 --> 00:53:24,580
Thank you.

318
00:53:25,641 --> 00:53:31,623
Uh, very Ingber next can ask you to unmute name and address for the record, please.

319
00:53:32,643 --> 00:53:34,364
Barry Ingber nine Draper Street.

320
00:53:35,104 --> 00:53:37,785
And I was part of the, uh,

321
00:53:39,013 --> 00:53:53,573
The group that worked on preparing the report and that wrote the ordinance, the first draft of the ordinance based on that, the conclusions of the report upon which the ordinance is based.

322
00:53:56,507 --> 00:54:06,757
We felt that the residents of Medford deserve a vibrant and empowered Human Rights Commission that promotes and protects the human and civil rights of all of Medford's residents.

323
00:54:07,598 --> 00:54:10,241
And sadly, this is now more true than ever.

324
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:15,766
To be effective, Medford's HRC requires an ordinance that A,

325
00:54:17,064 --> 00:54:28,267
clearly outlines its composition, roles, and responsibilities, and B, ensures the independence, authority, and resources required to fulfill its purpose.

326
00:54:29,728 --> 00:54:34,089
So what can and should an effective HRC do?

327
00:54:34,849 --> 00:54:38,471
Well, one is community education and engagement.

328
00:54:38,571 --> 00:54:39,451
I think that that's

329
00:54:41,057 --> 00:54:48,101
been often the focus point of the HRC in Medford when it's been at its best.

330
00:54:49,702 --> 00:55:04,110
Two is an advice and oversight role for the city, providing the city and other entities advice on matters of human rights and holding the city accountable for protecting equity and inclusion for everyone.

331
00:55:05,643 --> 00:55:27,234
And third is policy advocacy, advocating for laws, policies, and practices that support human rights and improve equity, addressing not only traditional forms of discrimination, but also the cultural and systemic issues that put segments of our community at a disadvantage or at risk.

332
00:55:30,035 --> 00:55:32,738
And what does an effective HRC need?

333
00:55:33,859 --> 00:55:35,641
Well, four things.

334
00:55:36,202 --> 00:55:38,104
One is independence.

335
00:55:39,405 --> 00:55:47,114
Independence from city administration, which is not a slight at the city administration or at any city administration.

336
00:55:47,274 --> 00:55:50,958
It's just addressing the fact that

337
00:55:51,925 --> 00:56:00,149
in order for the HRC to address, in order for it to be able to address human rights issues, it has to be outside the political fray.

338
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:08,493
A second thing it needs is the authority to set the agenda for addressing matters of human and civil rights.

339
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:14,496
A third thing it needs is the resources, including budget, space and staff support.

340
00:56:15,668 --> 00:56:33,483
A fourth thing is a membership, a committee membership that is sufficient to do its work, culturally proficient, and reflective of the many communities that make up our city, especially those that are traditionally targets of discriminatory behaviors and or systemic inequities.

341
00:56:35,544 --> 00:56:37,126
That is the summary.

342
00:56:37,386 --> 00:56:42,110
And so that's what the ordinance was built on.

343
00:56:42,710 --> 00:56:43,451
Thank you very much.

344
00:56:46,773 --> 00:56:47,354
you, Barry.

345
00:56:48,715 --> 00:56:49,937
Jennifer Yanko.

346
00:56:49,957 --> 00:56:51,178
I'm going to ask you to unmute.

347
00:56:51,218 --> 00:56:52,560
Name and address for the record, please.

348
00:56:54,081 --> 00:56:56,945
Jennifer Yanko, 16 Monument Street.

349
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:01,610
I wanted to present just a bit of background.

350
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:07,517
Some of this will be repeating what you've heard, but how this group

351
00:57:08,265 --> 00:57:12,848
this working group arrived at what you have in front of you now.

352
00:57:15,189 --> 00:57:24,535
We began our work towards the end of 2021 by drawing up a list of people who had been involved in Medford's HRC over the years, and that went

353
00:57:25,595 --> 00:57:28,460
baiting back to the McGlynn administration.

354
00:57:28,901 --> 00:57:39,557
These included former and then current commissioners, every chair of the HRC going back to 1999, and various others who had worked closely with the administration.

355
00:57:41,022 --> 00:58:00,177
Drawing on this list, we interviewed more than two dozen individuals, asking them to share with us what they found to be the most challenging obstacles to their work as a human rights commission, and their suggestions for how the HRC could be made stronger and more effective in fulfilling its mission.

356
00:58:01,373 --> 00:58:13,984
At the same time, as I believe Munir mentioned, the committee also studied HRCs in other cities and towns across the Commonwealth, looking at their composition, their missions, and their enabling legislation.

357
00:58:14,905 --> 00:58:27,597
So we drew on these rich data sources to develop a detailed proposal, which forms the basis of the draft ordinance that you have before you tonight.

358
00:58:29,467 --> 00:58:40,856
So what I wanted to convey is that this was not a hasty process, but it was one that involved a great deal of reflection, discussion with a wide range of stakeholders and research.

359
00:58:42,858 --> 00:58:47,942
And we feel that this is really of utmost importance right now.

360
00:58:48,883 --> 00:58:53,226
We need to raise our voice as a city and as a model for other cities.

361
00:58:54,047 --> 00:58:57,149
We need to make our city safer by showing that we believe in

362
00:58:58,326 --> 00:59:01,827
and that we're ready to defend the human rights of our residents.

363
00:59:05,288 --> 00:59:06,729
We urge you to adopt this.

364
00:59:08,329 --> 00:59:14,551
We believe it's of paramount importance at this present moment when, as we can see, human rights are under fire.

365
00:59:15,492 --> 00:59:15,872
Thank you.

366
00:59:15,892 --> 00:59:19,693
Thank you.

367
00:59:19,713 --> 00:59:25,395
Do we have any other members of the public who would like to speak?

368
00:59:29,595 --> 00:59:33,138
Steve Schnapp can ask you to unmute, name and address for the record, please.

369
00:59:34,379 --> 00:59:35,480
My name is Steve Schnapp.

370
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:38,662
I live at 36 Hillside Ave in Medford Square.

371
00:59:40,263 --> 00:59:46,228
I was a volunteer with the Human Rights Commission for approximately six or seven years, 2017, 2016 to 2022.

372
00:59:46,268 --> 00:59:47,589
Just one point about the access to council.

373
00:59:58,069 --> 01:00:06,163
We're living at a time when federal policies could have a profound impact on localities like Medford.

374
01:00:07,196 --> 01:00:17,020
There have been threats that communities that have welcoming city policies, as Medford, will lose federal funds.

375
01:00:17,661 --> 01:00:33,788
It's possible that the city administration, in the face of this kind of challenge and attack, might decide to drop that policy.

376
01:00:35,771 --> 01:00:48,265
The Human Rights Commission is one venue that could fight that, but it might need access to legal counsel in doing that.

377
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:54,352
And I would argue that that counsel should be independent from the city's counsel.

378
01:00:56,465 --> 01:00:57,025
So thank you.

379
01:00:57,646 --> 01:01:15,739
I also wanted to appreciate Councilor Tseng in sticking with this and working so hard to make sure that the Human Rights Commission will become an effective group of folks in the city of Medford.

380
01:01:15,779 --> 01:01:16,339
So thank you.

381
01:01:20,502 --> 01:01:23,544
So with the, I mean, I think this is what we,

382
01:01:24,751 --> 01:01:44,498
Well, this is what I asked about with that particular language that was written there, is that it doesn't really seem clear to me one way or the other, and that could be the intent whether or not the HRC would have access to independent legal counsel.

383
01:01:46,699 --> 01:01:53,282
And it looked like the original language specified that in the case that there wasn't a city solicitor,

384
01:01:54,492 --> 01:02:13,025
I think that must have been one draft of it that I saw in the edits, that they would get access to their own legal counsel, though that still doesn't quite account for the case where you have a city solicitor and you might want to have your own even with that person present.

385
01:02:13,446 --> 01:02:19,150
So I suppose I'm just wondering if there's any

386
01:02:20,423 --> 01:02:25,186
that you would have preferred the one that's currently in there, or do you think it should explicitly say so?

387
01:02:27,848 --> 01:02:28,429
David Harris?

388
01:02:32,211 --> 01:02:48,942
So, you know, I'm not part of the main group here, but I do think that, as I think you or one of your counselors indicated, you know, anybody can go and secure counsel anytime, you know, can get a legal opinion on their own.

389
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:55,182
I don't think it needs to be written into the ordinance for that to happen.

390
01:02:55,242 --> 01:03:01,284
And so I think part of the thinking is there's no reason to belabor it.

391
01:03:01,684 --> 01:03:14,589
And I don't know if that's consistent with what other people were thinking, but it's not a special, nobody would need permission to do that.

392
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:17,950
I don't think.

393
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:23,040
Barry?

394
01:03:27,044 --> 01:03:40,635
Being totally frank, I mean, as we talked about it, I think that we preferred the idea of having independent counsel.

395
01:03:42,337 --> 01:03:43,758
And I think that

396
01:03:45,638 --> 01:03:52,981
we largely concluded that we weren't going to die on that hill, that it was kind of a losing battle.

397
01:03:54,602 --> 01:04:04,507
And I think that what is important is maybe defining the word adequate to make sure that actually it is adequate.

398
01:04:06,528 --> 01:04:13,771
And to make sure that there is nothing that prevents the HRC from

399
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:24,254
Um, retaining its own volunteer council, um, if it wants to, because I could imagine it being told that has no right to do that.

400
01:04:25,154 --> 01:04:26,475
Um, so.

401
01:04:28,316 --> 01:04:38,000
If there's concern with funding council that could be working against the interests of other parts of the city, I think we can understand that.

402
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:41,782
Um, but, uh, it.

403
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:47,233
but resolving that needs to be done in a way that still maintains the independence of the HRC.

404
01:04:53,094 --> 01:04:56,114
Steve Schnapp asked you to unmute.

405
01:04:57,215 --> 01:04:57,615
Thank you.

406
01:04:57,755 --> 01:05:01,275
Yes, I agree both with David and Barry.

407
01:05:01,835 --> 01:05:07,856
I just want the language not to preclude the possibility of the HRC seeking some independent counsel.

408
01:05:10,757 --> 01:05:11,117
Jennifer.

409
01:05:12,853 --> 01:05:40,718
I was thinking in along those lines too that the wording which I believe says something to the effect that the city solicitor shall serve as counsel for the HRC and then we can add and this and the HRC may seek independent legal counsel as well or something where it's

410
01:05:43,691 --> 01:05:54,416
where the default is the solicitor, but that the commission is not precluded from seeking.

411
01:05:54,436 --> 01:05:59,098
Or maybe that's not even necessary, as David has suggested.

412
01:05:59,158 --> 01:06:10,424
I mean, you know, there's nothing keeping them from... I'm not sure.

413
01:06:10,644 --> 01:06:12,165
Now I'm confused again.

414
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:24,532
Councilor Sang, do you, did this come up in your conversations with, on the city side?

415
01:06:24,552 --> 01:06:30,935
I think there, I think they'd be hesitant to language.

416
01:06:32,871 --> 01:06:42,961
At this point, I'm starting to lean into speculation territory, so I don't want to speak for the mayor's office or for the administration.

417
01:06:42,981 --> 01:06:46,705
I would guess that they would say that

418
01:06:50,022 --> 01:06:55,084
Explicit references to independent legal counsel, I think they would be against.

419
01:06:56,025 --> 01:07:02,047
I wonder if there's some wiggle room where we clarify that there's no preclusion.

420
01:07:02,928 --> 01:07:06,630
But I think it's an art to do that.

421
01:07:07,110 --> 01:07:13,153
So if people have suggested language that kind of goes, you know,

422
01:07:14,753 --> 01:07:16,514
You know, there's that needle.

423
01:07:16,994 --> 01:07:20,074
I'd be happy to hear your suggestions.

424
01:07:22,475 --> 01:07:24,175
David, Harris asked you to unmute.

425
01:07:25,996 --> 01:07:34,458
So again, to the counselors, I can't presume to think I know and understand what your situations are like.

426
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:37,798
But I would say that I do think it's better.

427
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:45,251
Leaving it as it is, it leaves it open.

428
01:07:45,431 --> 01:07:52,732
I mean, for the commission, if it felt that it needed to turn outside counsel to go and get it.

429
01:07:53,493 --> 01:08:02,675
To bring a topic up at this point seems to me to provide the opportunity to say no and to put something in.

430
01:08:02,795 --> 01:08:09,016
So I think to my mind, if they don't bring it up,

431
01:08:10,270 --> 01:08:20,193
doesn't need to be brought up because it would put them in a position of conceivably saying no.

432
01:08:24,013 --> 01:08:24,914
There's no reason.

433
01:08:26,434 --> 01:08:31,455
I don't know what the reason is to put that speculation in the ordinance.

434
01:08:34,816 --> 01:08:37,557
Kassar, do you understand the kind of hesitancy there?

435
01:08:39,869 --> 01:08:42,470
I think that aligns with how I see it.

436
01:08:44,311 --> 01:08:44,631
Steve.

437
01:08:46,072 --> 01:08:47,332
Yes, thank you.

438
01:08:47,472 --> 01:08:48,393
I completely agree.

439
01:08:48,933 --> 01:08:57,856
I'm just thinking that I don't want the language to revert to the HOC has to use the city solicitor.

440
01:08:58,757 --> 01:08:59,777
That's my concern.

441
01:09:00,618 --> 01:09:06,060
But I agree we don't have to be provocative and try and wordsmith some loophole.

442
01:09:07,458 --> 01:09:23,309
it's not in the interest, but if it turns out that there's pressure to push that language that constricts the HRC to using the city solicitor, that there'd be some pushback to that.

443
01:09:28,592 --> 01:09:35,517
I mean, I can personally see it flying both ways because on

444
01:09:36,782 --> 01:09:48,324
Like you could have one party insisting that that means only the city's legal counsel.

445
01:09:48,344 --> 01:10:00,727
You could have another party insisting that it, it would really just depend on what you're reading is, is it, what you're reading of it is at the time.

446
01:10:02,989 --> 01:10:11,635
But I also do agree that there's not really a need to belabor the point presently.

447
01:10:15,518 --> 01:10:15,898
Jennifer.

448
01:10:18,260 --> 01:10:32,070
I was just imagining cases where the HRC would legitimately, that is to say, need to consult other counsel.

449
01:10:33,708 --> 01:10:38,773
but not a case where the city administration was in question.

450
01:10:39,974 --> 01:10:49,384
For example, there may be something, human rights law, that the solicitor or whoever's serving in that position is not really expert in.

451
01:10:50,785 --> 01:10:57,572
So it seems that there would be reasonable reasons to consult

452
01:10:59,732 --> 01:11:02,013
other legal counsel.

453
01:11:02,473 --> 01:11:17,601
But I agree that it doesn't need to be in there, as long as the wording that we have doesn't get construed as must use only the solicitor.

454
01:11:17,621 --> 01:11:20,102
Thank you.

455
01:11:20,262 --> 01:11:21,203
And Vanier?

456
01:11:24,861 --> 01:11:29,304
I think, yeah, leaving it as it is, it should be okay.

457
01:11:29,665 --> 01:11:41,612
I mean, I can envision a situation where, let's say, suddenly the HRC decides they want to, you know, get a legal opinion from someone else.

458
01:11:42,733 --> 01:11:43,293
And they get it.

459
01:11:43,954 --> 01:11:45,575
Is the city gonna say that's illegal?

460
01:11:45,995 --> 01:11:46,155
No.

461
01:11:47,276 --> 01:11:52,219
So I think, I think, I think leaving it as it is should be fine.

462
01:11:54,289 --> 01:11:55,831
Thank you.

463
01:11:56,672 --> 01:12:04,821
Are there any other anything, anything else that counselors would like to say, I'm, I'm just trying to think through this, just to.

464
01:12:06,495 --> 01:12:11,297
make sure what we're doing aligns with what's been said.

465
01:12:11,477 --> 01:12:24,843
I think generally I still think that this is probably the best language because I think it leaves it open enough, but I could see it being construed that the city solicitor shall serve as the council of the commission.

466
01:12:25,223 --> 01:12:33,527
Like I think there's a, to use legal terms, there's an ordinary meaning argument that

467
01:12:34,286 --> 01:12:44,142
An ordinary person reading the ordinance would likely think that that restricts legal counsel to only the city solicitor and

468
01:12:45,434 --> 01:12:52,298
But at the same time, I think you can also make the argument that that wouldn't align with the legislative intent here.

469
01:12:53,019 --> 01:12:58,462
And it doesn't align with the record, which we'll see in the committee report when Adam finishes it.

470
01:13:00,523 --> 01:13:03,665
So it could really cut both ways, I guess is what I'm saying.

471
01:13:07,037 --> 01:13:08,518
Yeah.

472
01:13:09,118 --> 01:13:13,019
I mean, I don't think any of this precludes informal legal advice.

473
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:32,007
I think the thing that it would preclude is a formal legal memo that an HRC might use to take legal action, which I don't think, in most cases, the HRC would have a cause of action anyways.

474
01:13:33,007 --> 01:13:38,790
So I don't think it'd be relevant, like I don't think it'd be material to the conversation.

475
01:13:38,830 --> 01:13:52,096
So I don't think, I think as long as like, we're, as long as people are okay with this potentially being cabined to, you know, informal legal advice, the type that we kind of see very, very often.

476
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:58,863
I think that's at the very minimum with this allows for this current language.

477
01:13:58,943 --> 01:14:06,829
But if we want to, you know, if we want to get past that box, then we should think about maybe other proposed language.

478
01:14:08,871 --> 01:14:11,873
I'm going to go to Barry and then yeah.

479
01:14:16,456 --> 01:14:21,480
So two mutually exclusive

480
01:14:22,640 --> 01:14:23,100
ideas.

481
01:14:23,861 --> 01:14:36,268
One is to change the word in the first sentence, city solicitor shall to change it to the city solicitor may serve.

482
01:14:36,768 --> 01:14:42,191
I don't know if that creates other problems, but that's one possible solution.

483
01:14:42,952 --> 01:14:51,677
Another is to just leave out the city solicitor sentence and just say that the HRC shall be provided adequate resources or however that's worded there.

484
01:14:56,597 --> 01:14:57,358
Thank you.

485
01:14:58,558 --> 01:15:03,022
So counselor saying did you say that you wanted to get this done.

486
01:15:03,983 --> 01:15:09,667
Next month, or what was your what was your plan in terms of wanting to refer it to regular meeting.

487
01:15:10,444 --> 01:15:23,513
Yeah, my plan is for us to accept a version of this with edits, so I can bring it to the mayor and say that it's the most recent version from this committee.

488
01:15:24,714 --> 01:15:31,439
And the mayor has told me that there are some substantive edits that she might want to be looking at.

489
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,761
My plan in full transparency is to

490
01:15:36,382 --> 01:15:40,586
write down the edits that she wants to make, talk through them.

491
01:15:41,147 --> 01:15:47,052
And of course, I'll talk about the legislative intent of this committee as well.

492
01:15:47,092 --> 01:15:48,473
So I'll speak from that perspective.

493
01:15:49,615 --> 01:15:52,938
And then I'll bring those proposed edits back to this committee.

494
01:15:54,399 --> 01:15:58,481
Maybe there might be a compromise text too.

495
01:15:59,021 --> 01:16:07,146
So the mayor and I might reach a compromise and we can review that all together as a committee at our next meeting in April.

496
01:16:07,606 --> 01:16:08,707
I believe it's April.

497
01:16:10,288 --> 01:16:18,472
And hopefully we'll be able to vote something out of committee by that meeting so that we can get on enforcing this pretty quickly.

498
01:16:22,195 --> 01:16:25,377
I also wanted to add, I actually think Barry's suggestions are quite good.

499
01:16:26,038 --> 01:16:41,449
I think either of those edits, maybe even just striking the city solicitor sentence might work, although I believe we kept the city solicitor language in because Councilor Scarapelli said that he favored that.

500
01:16:41,989 --> 01:16:46,693
And so maybe we made the first, the former edit of switching shell to me.

501
01:16:48,411 --> 01:16:50,392
But that's also a question for this committee too.

502
01:16:52,313 --> 01:16:54,874
There are more counselors than just me and George.

503
01:16:55,954 --> 01:16:56,234
Yeah.

504
01:16:56,254 --> 01:17:00,436
So do you want to change the shall to may?

505
01:17:01,396 --> 01:17:03,177
I mean, I think either proposal would work.

506
01:17:03,317 --> 01:17:07,359
I think actually the latter is a stronger proposal just to strike the first sentence.

507
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:13,542
But, but I think that depends on what this committee wants.

508
01:17:13,562 --> 01:17:14,522
Okay.

509
01:17:17,309 --> 01:17:21,031
I'm in favor of striking it, but David Harris.

510
01:17:23,752 --> 01:17:30,595
I don't want to belabor this and I leave it to you all to deliberate, but the problem with putting the may in is it means that they may not too, right?

511
01:17:31,255 --> 01:17:35,917
It means it suggests that the solicitor can say, no, I don't want to, I'm not going to do it.

512
01:17:38,199 --> 01:17:43,661
So I, you know, I mean, you know, just striking it might,

513
01:17:45,441 --> 01:17:47,802
Anyway, just wanted to consider that.

514
01:17:52,523 --> 01:17:53,404
Okay, yeah.

515
01:17:54,984 --> 01:17:55,504
Good point.

516
01:17:56,665 --> 01:17:57,825
Any other comments from councillors?

517
01:18:00,206 --> 01:18:02,707
Well, I mean, it does sound like there is consensus.

518
01:18:05,370 --> 01:18:14,172
on the vast majority of this document, although I do think that there are some potential issues with that sentence.

519
01:18:14,192 --> 01:18:19,673
They're definitely not as many as the length of time we've spent discussing it would imply.

520
01:18:19,833 --> 01:18:26,314
So we did definitely belabor the point, but I do think that these are relatively minor issues at the end of the day.

521
01:18:28,254 --> 01:18:30,635
With that, do we have any motions on the floor?

522
01:18:32,534 --> 01:18:39,623
I would motion to accept the edits and to keep the paper in committee.

523
01:18:40,083 --> 01:18:43,848
But before we take a vote on that, I just wanted to talk about other things.

524
01:18:44,269 --> 01:18:44,529
Okay.

525
01:18:44,769 --> 01:18:45,450
Yeah, sure.

526
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:52,377
Um, so let me, I guess maybe I should share my screen again.

527
01:18:52,397 --> 01:18:57,779
I guess the first thing I do want to get clarification on, but I know we talked about this quite a bit.

528
01:18:58,360 --> 01:19:05,962
Um, is there consensus on this committee about, um, what language I should present to the mayor regarding section subsection a here?

529
01:19:12,745 --> 01:19:16,526
Um, I think.

530
01:19:18,868 --> 01:19:26,830
Personally, and Anna or Emily, feel free to raise your hand and jump in with your own suggestions.

531
01:19:27,010 --> 01:19:28,930
OK, Emily, yeah, you speak first.

532
01:19:30,410 --> 01:19:30,950
I'm sorry.

533
01:19:30,970 --> 01:19:33,291
I just don't have a legal opinion about this.

534
01:19:33,391 --> 01:19:35,191
I'm listening to what you guys are saying.

535
01:19:35,231 --> 01:19:38,812
I just don't have the expertise to weigh in.

536
01:19:38,852 --> 01:19:44,193
I just wanted you to know that I feel neutral on this.

537
01:19:47,593 --> 01:19:48,093
Sorry.

538
01:19:48,714 --> 01:19:48,934
Anna.

539
01:19:50,376 --> 01:19:52,438
Yeah, I mean, I feel similarly.

540
01:19:52,458 --> 01:20:01,746
I suspect that if we do strike that first sentence, then the mayor will have an opinion and, you know, we can like strike it as a suggestion.

541
01:20:01,866 --> 01:20:09,473
But if the mayor comes back, I'm not concerned that this will ever be used to say that they cannot.

542
01:20:10,554 --> 01:20:11,774
use some other legal opinion.

543
01:20:11,794 --> 01:20:24,618
I think the fact that we have discussed it here and that we are saying it is our intention that that second sentence means that they are allowed to seek other counsel, I think is fine.

544
01:20:24,898 --> 01:20:26,438
So I'm not, I'm not concerned about it.

545
01:20:26,498 --> 01:20:28,079
And I think either way is probably fine.

546
01:20:28,539 --> 01:20:33,580
And even if we send it to the mayor with only one sentence, only the second sentence, she may send it back with the first one added.

547
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:35,701
So, which I think would also be fine.

548
01:20:36,941 --> 01:20:37,141
Thanks.

549
01:20:39,213 --> 01:20:45,958
I personally, I personally think that presenting this current language is fine, but I would like to.

550
01:20:45,978 --> 01:20:55,104
Float some of the suggestions that were presented by by members in this meeting to her to just see what.

551
01:20:56,243 --> 01:20:57,684
to see what you think about that.

552
01:20:57,704 --> 01:21:00,326
I do under, yep.

553
01:21:01,126 --> 01:21:05,209
One suggestion just popped up in my head from what Anna said.

554
01:21:06,189 --> 01:21:16,055
Perhaps we can say this, the commission shall seek and have adequate access to council.

555
01:21:17,276 --> 01:21:20,018
Well, Anna.

556
01:21:22,951 --> 01:21:24,633
Your hands, sorry, it's your hands raised.

557
01:21:24,773 --> 01:21:26,895
Sorry, no, that was that was not intentional.

558
01:21:26,935 --> 01:21:28,136
Yeah.

559
01:21:29,398 --> 01:21:34,583
I feel like that goes into like what they're talking about, what we're talking about before, like potentially like putting in loopholes.

560
01:21:34,643 --> 01:21:36,185
I'll just get the mayor to say no.

561
01:21:36,205 --> 01:21:37,246
So I would be.

562
01:21:37,266 --> 01:21:39,868
I think I think it's it's.

563
01:21:41,649 --> 01:21:51,914
It's a good idea and there were suggestions to like more strongly imply it But I would I would just kind of try to float by her like some of the different suggestions.

564
01:21:52,714 --> 01:22:05,300
I would personally personally I would be more comfortable With a little bit more clarity here, but I'm also concerned about just the potential for saying no and like more delays and

565
01:22:06,312 --> 01:22:06,932
And so on.

566
01:22:08,133 --> 01:22:08,773
Yeah.

567
01:22:08,793 --> 01:22:13,976
Just for the record, my proposal to add the word seek wasn't to create a loophole.

568
01:22:14,377 --> 01:22:15,997
I think seek is an active verb.

569
01:22:16,178 --> 01:22:24,742
So that's just where I'm coming from is adding another active verb to, to open up that to clarify the, um, the abilities.

570
01:22:25,183 --> 01:22:26,323
Yeah.

571
01:22:26,343 --> 01:22:28,284
Yeah.

572
01:22:28,825 --> 01:22:29,065
Yeah.

573
01:22:29,225 --> 01:22:30,626
I can generally talk to her about it.

574
01:22:30,666 --> 01:22:30,846
Yeah.

575
01:22:31,306 --> 01:22:31,586
Okay.

576
01:22:32,046 --> 01:22:33,107
Cause yeah.

577
01:22:33,547 --> 01:22:33,687
Yep.

578
01:22:34,147 --> 01:22:34,408
All right.

579
01:22:34,688 --> 01:22:34,728
Uh,

580
01:22:35,488 --> 01:22:54,768
The other amendment I actually would like to make, I haven't talked to folks about this yet, but I do think putting at minimum here just allows the commission to have a bit more flexibility in terms of, you know, if a major human rights issue has come up in the middle of the year.

581
01:22:55,588 --> 01:22:59,191
And, you know, people are demanding action from the city about it.

582
01:22:59,611 --> 01:23:09,097
And then maybe let's say the HRC does something, I'd be afraid that if we just kept it at annual reports, that constrains them to like waiting a whole six months to publish a report.

583
01:23:10,017 --> 01:23:12,659
So just putting at minimum, I think gives them a bit more flexibility.

584
01:23:17,782 --> 01:23:18,182
And that's all.

585
01:23:22,605 --> 01:23:23,166
Oh, Matt, you're up.

586
01:23:23,246 --> 01:23:23,666
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

587
01:23:24,201 --> 01:23:34,984
Could it be phrased a little bit more cleanly, like in the form of reports that are at least annual, like at minimum annual?

588
01:23:35,044 --> 01:23:38,205
It's not a big deal.

589
01:23:38,266 --> 01:23:47,128
I'm just... Okay.

590
01:23:47,568 --> 01:23:48,049
Never mind.

591
01:23:48,089 --> 01:23:48,809
That's fine.

592
01:23:48,909 --> 01:23:50,229
I'm being pedantic at this point.

593
01:23:50,889 --> 01:23:51,530
Okay.

594
01:23:53,994 --> 01:23:54,174
Okay.

595
01:23:55,614 --> 01:24:01,956
Anyway, is there anything else that you want to go over in this?

596
01:24:03,156 --> 01:24:03,716
Nope, that's all.

597
01:24:05,857 --> 01:24:07,457
There's a motion on the floor, but that's all.

598
01:24:08,817 --> 01:24:10,198
Okay.

599
01:24:10,438 --> 01:24:11,698
Do we have a second on the motion?

600
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:17,979
Second by Councilor Lozaro.

601
01:24:18,840 --> 01:24:20,520
Would you mind rereading the motion back?

602
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:20,960
Thanks.

603
01:24:23,270 --> 01:24:29,695
It's a motion to accept the edits and receive in place on file.

604
01:24:30,535 --> 01:24:31,436
To keep in committee.

605
01:24:32,156 --> 01:24:33,177
And keep in committee.

606
01:24:34,198 --> 01:24:38,841
Not to replace, not to receive in place on file, because that would finish the paper.

607
01:24:39,581 --> 01:24:41,743
Well, never mind then.

608
01:24:42,303 --> 01:24:43,064
I'm tired.

609
01:24:43,264 --> 01:24:45,005
I'm operating on.

610
01:24:45,065 --> 01:24:46,526
We had a long meeting yesterday too.

611
01:24:48,494 --> 01:24:51,355
Yeah, this is a much more, this is more pleasant.

612
01:24:52,815 --> 01:24:54,935
But yes, I am tired from that.

613
01:24:56,276 --> 01:24:57,276
But anyway, yes.

614
01:24:57,896 --> 01:25:03,097
So yeah, that's the motion.

615
01:25:04,878 --> 01:25:06,638
Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

616
01:25:08,499 --> 01:25:09,219
Councilor Calderon?

617
01:25:10,859 --> 01:25:11,059
Yes.

618
01:25:12,359 --> 01:25:13,300
Councilor Lazzaro?

619
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:14,000
Yes.

620
01:25:15,258 --> 01:25:16,499
Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

621
01:25:16,899 --> 01:25:17,500
Councilor Seng?

622
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:18,060
Yes.

623
01:25:18,761 --> 01:25:19,262
Chair Lemming?

624
01:25:19,822 --> 01:25:20,082
Yes.

625
01:25:20,663 --> 01:25:21,804
Four in the affirmative.

626
01:25:23,225 --> 01:25:23,845
None opposed.

627
01:25:23,885 --> 01:25:24,886
The motion passes.

628
01:25:25,727 --> 01:25:28,590
Thank you all for coming out.

629
01:25:29,070 --> 01:25:42,381
We are now going to move on to the senior center listening session reports, which I'm sure that folks would love to hear about.

630
01:25:43,824 --> 01:25:45,185
But no, thank you all.

631
01:25:45,205 --> 01:25:46,587
Thank you all very much for coming out.

632
01:25:46,627 --> 01:25:51,111
And I'm looking forward to pushing this forward at the next meeting.

633
01:25:51,452 --> 01:25:53,213
And thank you all so much for your work on this.

634
01:25:54,094 --> 01:25:58,138
Thank you all for showing up and for speaking and for your hard work on this.

635
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:00,241
I'm feeling good about it.

636
01:26:00,381 --> 01:26:03,904
I think we can get somewhere by the next month.

637
01:26:04,445 --> 01:26:04,645
Yeah.

638
01:26:05,226 --> 01:26:05,826
Thank you all.

639
01:26:07,087 --> 01:26:07,448
Thank you.

640
01:26:14,073 --> 01:26:31,129
Okay, I just included this item on the agenda because there were previous initiatives to, there were previous requests to actually report back a few things that we heard about from some of the listening sessions.

641
01:26:32,650 --> 01:26:35,732
We've had two listening sessions at the Senior Center.

642
01:26:37,232 --> 01:26:38,233
I've attended both of them.

643
01:26:38,293 --> 01:26:43,876
I was accompanied by Councilor Lazaro the first time, and most recent one by Councilor Callahan.

644
01:26:45,697 --> 01:26:51,560
Just for a very brief report, they went, I think, I personally think they went well.

645
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:54,722
There, I mean, of course, there's a little bit of contention, like they're

646
01:26:55,763 --> 01:27:03,913
like there often is at these things, but a lot of it was just like residents just voicing concerns, particularly with the roads.

647
01:27:05,375 --> 01:27:11,984
I think probably half of what we heard about was potholes in the city and parking.

648
01:27:12,044 --> 01:27:13,646
There are general concerns about

649
01:27:14,938 --> 01:27:18,921
the pop-up park and the RFPs at the planning department.

650
01:27:20,582 --> 01:27:23,324
Concerns that that would remove parking spaces.

651
01:27:23,384 --> 01:27:41,177
I think that in both of the listening sessions, we were trying to clarify that the planning office didn't intend to remove any sort of parking, but intended to accept a proposal that would turn it into ground floor parking.

652
01:27:44,011 --> 01:27:54,160
then a lot of discussions about the override and discussions about the override and affordability as well.

653
01:27:56,842 --> 01:28:10,274
And then another thing that happened was, you know, I think that, you know, a couple of residents were just like kind of being, were kind of like, you know,

654
01:28:11,335 --> 01:28:14,496
taking up a lot of the sort of hour that we were there.

655
01:28:14,576 --> 01:28:30,981
And so afterwards, and this especially happened the most recent one, a lot of residents approached us individually and just asked Councillor Callaghan and I about sort of their own pet issues that they were concerned about, but they didn't really feel like asking in front of an audience.

656
01:28:32,681 --> 01:28:36,702
Like one fellow approached me and he asked if he could roll an auto pay in the city.

657
01:28:36,722 --> 01:28:36,782
And

658
01:28:40,036 --> 01:28:45,343
Yeah, so so those were that's kind of like my own library report of how that went.

659
01:28:45,383 --> 01:28:46,384
I do think it went well.

660
01:28:46,424 --> 01:28:57,218
I think it's good to connect with residents that don't normally have computer access quite as consistently and just be there and try to explain how things are working in the city.

661
01:28:58,582 --> 01:29:00,503
I did email from the second session I did.

662
01:29:00,523 --> 01:29:10,030
I know Councilor Callahan and I, who I see your hand raised, did report back some of the concerns to the relevant departments in the city, just so they're aware of them.

663
01:29:10,050 --> 01:29:13,873
So yeah, no, I feel like it was a good initiative.

664
01:29:13,893 --> 01:29:15,414
There was like 12 to 15 at each.

665
01:29:15,434 --> 01:29:17,195
I think even more at the last one.

666
01:29:17,215 --> 01:29:19,897
So yeah, Councilor Callahan, feel free to go.

667
01:29:23,530 --> 01:29:24,391
Thank you.

668
01:29:24,691 --> 01:29:27,572
Yeah, I just wanted to give my own little bit of report back on this.

669
01:29:28,093 --> 01:29:30,914
I think my take on it was slightly different.

670
01:29:32,175 --> 01:29:46,344
I did, you know, the first interaction I had with someone after the official hour was over was someone who said that she felt that the whole tone was very angry and that she, you know, felt uncomfortable.

671
01:29:46,364 --> 01:29:47,104
And so,

672
01:29:49,473 --> 01:29:54,397
being a person who has done other listening sessions, you know, with other groups.

673
01:29:54,417 --> 01:29:55,938
I know we have all done some of them.

674
01:29:56,098 --> 01:30:03,483
But my hope is that for the next one that I attend, I will be more facilitating.

675
01:30:03,503 --> 01:30:10,328
I will come with, you know, some visuals on topics that can be discussed.

676
01:30:11,208 --> 01:30:12,950
I do think that when one or two

677
01:30:13,530 --> 01:30:22,613
people dominate the conversation with angry rhetoric, it makes it very difficult for other people to discuss the things that they need.

678
01:30:23,113 --> 01:30:31,956
And I felt that the conversation that started the second the hour was over were actually conversations that were not pet projects.

679
01:30:32,296 --> 01:30:33,197
These were the real

680
01:30:34,117 --> 01:30:35,458
things that people are concerned about.

681
01:30:35,978 --> 01:30:39,359
I heard people talk about their need for housing as a senior.

682
01:30:39,540 --> 01:30:48,844
The things that I heard over and over and over at the doors that to me are the primary issues that did not get discussed during that hour.

683
01:30:49,924 --> 01:31:00,069
It was things like the lack of transportation for elderly people, that there used to be something called Megan Transport, and there used to be other ways that they could get around the city, but those things are not there anymore.

684
01:31:00,169 --> 01:31:03,611
So they, you know, were wondering what we can do about that.

685
01:31:03,711 --> 01:31:05,673
And then some talked about housing.

686
01:31:05,913 --> 01:31:15,819
And, you know, as I mentioned, some of the things that I'm working on, the home sharing, bringing home sharing, matching service to Medford.

687
01:31:15,839 --> 01:31:19,502
And I talked about co-housing, and I talked about, you know, other

688
01:31:20,303 --> 01:31:28,672
Like the RFP and how the hope is that that will have a lot of smaller units that older people can move into because they talked about wanting to downsize.

689
01:31:28,993 --> 01:31:33,899
So these were the conversations that I think are the, the more

690
01:31:36,446 --> 01:31:56,780
general ones that many, many seniors want to talk about, and the ones that we ended up talking about for an hour were more the pet projects of like, my street has a pothole in this one place, and I want to know about that pothole, or I want to continue talking about Salem Street, when we already have public forums for talking about the Salem Street zoning.

691
01:31:57,580 --> 01:32:14,197
That should be something, it's fine if somebody wants to bring it up and talk about it for three minutes, but that shouldn't dominate the conversation at these listening sessions because it prevents us from hearing from the nine-tenths of people who are in attendance who aren't there for that particular issue.

692
01:32:14,457 --> 01:32:17,159
We already have forums for talking about that particular issue.

693
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:21,003
My plan is that I will be facilitating more,

694
01:32:22,164 --> 01:32:28,530
And then I did take some of these issues and following up with city staff.

695
01:32:28,770 --> 01:32:38,578
I talked to the economic development director and talking about the RFP, talking about parking near the senior center.

696
01:32:39,198 --> 01:32:41,520
I'll be following up with the planning department.

697
01:32:41,820 --> 01:32:49,226
I followed up with DPW as well with some more general questions about when do they have

698
01:32:50,488 --> 01:33:00,694
plans that they post on the website, like the engineering department actually posted last year, two different plans, like a crack ceiling plan and I believe like a pothole filling plan.

699
01:33:00,714 --> 01:33:03,755
And just when were we gonna be able to see those?

700
01:33:03,775 --> 01:33:09,658
Because people do wanna know when these things are going, like which streets are gonna be done next.

701
01:33:09,678 --> 01:33:11,519
And so I was kind of looking for a timeline for that.

702
01:33:12,860 --> 01:33:17,803
And just generally following up with city staff on some of the specific questions.

703
01:33:19,104 --> 01:33:20,885
that were coming up during that session.

704
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:33,434
So I do think it was a good session, but I think that we can do better in terms of our ability to make sure that residents who are showing up at these feel comfortable, that they don't feel like it's

705
01:33:34,515 --> 01:33:49,106
Like they are shut out by a small group that has a particular agenda, but that we are actively asking questions about the things we have an idea that, you know, seniors care about or

706
01:33:49,946 --> 01:34:04,229
any listening session that it might be, whether it's like parents or folks at West Medford Community Center, or no matter who it is, we might have some facilitated questions where we are asking people, hey, we'd love to know your opinion about, you know, housing.

707
01:34:04,269 --> 01:34:05,049
Like, how is housing going?

708
01:34:05,069 --> 01:34:06,770
We want to know your opinion about transportation around the city.

709
01:34:06,790 --> 01:34:11,051
We want to know your opinion, you know, about, like, how is this affecting you in your life?

710
01:34:11,311 --> 01:34:14,992
So, thank you so much for letting me give a little bit of a longer report back on that.

711
01:34:16,867 --> 01:34:18,227
I'm excited that we're doing these.

712
01:34:18,468 --> 01:34:21,829
And I think the more of them we do, the better we'll get.

713
01:34:22,089 --> 01:34:32,432
And I'm really excited to make them places where residents feel comfortable and welcomed and that they are, their input is, you know, that they can also give input.

714
01:34:32,452 --> 01:34:39,414
And we have kind of a step up, step back, understanding that these are for everyone to contribute equally.

715
01:34:39,874 --> 01:34:40,114
Thanks.

716
01:34:40,835 --> 01:34:41,155
Thank you.

717
01:34:41,275 --> 01:34:41,955
Councilor Lazaro.

718
01:34:43,095 --> 01:34:43,455
Thank you.

719
01:34:43,675 --> 01:34:51,919
I think one thing I would want to, I'll be doing the next one of these at the senior center at the end of March.

720
01:34:52,679 --> 01:35:12,788
And something I'm looking forward to for the next one is just focusing on when we brought this to the floor at the regular meeting, the reason it kind of came up and why we wanted to make sure it was a priority for our body was

721
01:35:14,053 --> 01:35:23,199
least in my mind, that regular city council meetings aren't really a great opportunity for people to bring their issues to the floor.

722
01:35:23,892 --> 01:35:42,162
a great time to do it is in these kind of one-on-one sessions where we have more time and space, you can bring whatever is really bothering you that you really need the attention from people in the city to something that is really critical to your experience.

723
01:35:44,743 --> 01:35:52,487
And I don't think that this is what you were, what Councillor Callaghan was saying, but I would only say that like,

724
01:35:52,948 --> 01:35:58,996
one nice thing about the listening sessions is that somebody can bring up whatever is pertinent to their experience.

725
01:35:59,537 --> 01:36:08,570
So if it's something that's different than like, if they're not concerned about housing, but they are concerned about parking, they could talk about parking even if we want to talk about housing.

726
01:36:09,150 --> 01:36:15,132
So I guess that's something that I feel like would be a concern.

727
01:36:15,232 --> 01:36:19,634
Because when we're in our regular meetings, we're only supposed to be talking about what's on the agenda.

728
01:36:20,394 --> 01:36:23,976
And when we're in a listening session, we're there to hear whatever is on their mind.

729
01:36:24,416 --> 01:36:29,498
We don't have a really robust constituent services apparatus right now.

730
01:36:30,498 --> 01:36:33,719
Sorry, I'm in the planning office and the light keeps turning off on me.

731
01:36:34,880 --> 01:36:35,660
And I came to

732
01:36:36,252 --> 01:36:36,652
City Hall.

733
01:36:37,113 --> 01:36:38,034
I didn't realize it was Zoom only.

734
01:36:39,074 --> 01:36:54,827
The point is, I think that we can build a more robust constituent services apparatus by listening to what people are bringing to us, by offering them, if we have a really concrete list of these are the city services we have access to, we can point you in the right direction.

735
01:36:54,987 --> 01:37:01,373
If you are in need of something, you're telling us right to our face, we can tell you how to get that, and we can point you in the right direction.

736
01:37:02,113 --> 01:37:07,316
That is something that I think is really nice about the listening sessions when people bring those things to the floor.

737
01:37:08,877 --> 01:37:15,980
But I think you are right that sometimes it can be very uncomfortable when people bring it to the floor in front of everybody that's around them and they have an axe to grind.

738
01:37:16,401 --> 01:37:18,061
That's not always the most effective.

739
01:37:18,542 --> 01:37:25,886
But the other thing I will say is that I think the more we do these things, the less it's going to be about stuff that is, you know,

740
01:37:26,886 --> 01:37:29,589
something that's something everybody's talking about all the time.

741
01:37:30,130 --> 01:37:39,580
If it's only going to be about Salem Street zoning, eventually we're going to have said everything there is to say about Salem Street zoning and we'll have to move on to something else.

742
01:37:40,321 --> 01:37:41,562
We're still showing up for these.

743
01:37:43,504 --> 01:37:46,066
Our committee is still showing up for the listening sessions.

744
01:37:46,566 --> 01:37:47,747
We will still be there.

745
01:37:47,907 --> 01:37:51,209
I am looking forward to the session on March 27th.

746
01:37:52,410 --> 01:37:55,792
If people want to talk about Salem Street zoning, let's talk about Salem Street zoning.

747
01:37:55,933 --> 01:37:57,193
I'll tell you everything I know about it.

748
01:37:57,654 --> 01:38:04,158
You can tell me everything you think and feel and know about it, and we'll have another conversation and I'll write down everything you say.

749
01:38:05,179 --> 01:38:07,841
You know, that's what the listening session is for.

750
01:38:07,941 --> 01:38:11,363
That's not what the regular meeting is for, and that's the difference.

751
01:38:14,137 --> 01:38:14,717
Councilor Sang.

752
01:38:15,457 --> 01:38:15,837
Thank you.

753
01:38:16,778 --> 01:38:20,219
Yeah, I think there's so many great ideas floating around right now.

754
01:38:20,339 --> 01:38:26,762
First, I just want to thank you to Chair Lemming and Councilor Callahan for this report.

755
01:38:28,083 --> 01:38:40,588
It's really helpful for us to hear about what's being discussed and the issues that people are bringing up and to think about best practices and how we can adjust how we're running these things.

756
01:38:40,628 --> 01:38:41,129
It's such a

757
01:38:41,869 --> 01:38:48,013
It's a new concept, so we're always working out how we implement it.

758
01:38:48,053 --> 01:38:49,034
So that's really helpful.

759
01:38:50,254 --> 01:39:08,426
I really like what Councillor Callaghan is thinking with regards to making these conversations, these forums, these spaces to be more inclusive and less intimidating for people who might want to bring something up and doesn't feel like they're able to say it.

760
01:39:10,427 --> 01:39:22,699
I'm excited to see where that goes and if we find maybe down the road, it'd be great to work on a list of best practices for facilitating these meetings.

761
01:39:22,779 --> 01:39:27,263
I know Councillor Callaghan had a document early on in the year that was really helpful.

762
01:39:27,723 --> 01:39:34,590
Maybe if we keep working on something like that and if we have any new observations about how to best run these meetings,

763
01:39:35,530 --> 01:39:40,513
collecting those and disseminating them to counselors would be really, a really good idea.

764
01:39:40,733 --> 01:39:55,521
And I think to Councilor Lazaro's point, if we see, you know, issues come up again and again, collecting the resources beforehand, being ready for those meetings to disseminate that information, that'd be very helpful.

765
01:39:57,642 --> 01:39:58,242
Councilor Calhan.

766
01:40:02,539 --> 01:40:03,339
Hey, thanks.

767
01:40:03,580 --> 01:40:04,860
I am going to yes and.

768
01:40:06,141 --> 01:40:08,702
I'm excited about what Councilor Lazaro was saying.

769
01:40:10,043 --> 01:40:20,768
And as often happens with me, I didn't mention that, yes, of course, we also will listen to concerns that people come with.

770
01:40:21,068 --> 01:40:27,151
I think maybe we either have the first half or the second half of the listening session dedicated to that.

771
01:40:28,552 --> 01:40:33,315
so that there's a specific time that is like, hey, we're going to ask you questions.

772
01:40:33,695 --> 01:40:36,977
And then there's a time that's like, hey, you ask us questions.

773
01:40:37,918 --> 01:40:53,587
But I think it's rare that elected officials do the part that I'm talking about, where they're actively asking people, hey, I actually want to know how housing is affecting your life.

774
01:40:55,138 --> 01:40:58,380
And that's a piece that I think is really important.

775
01:40:58,420 --> 01:41:04,882
So I would love to have that piece added to what I think what we have been doing, which is more of an office hours.

776
01:41:05,002 --> 01:41:08,544
Office hours is like anybody can show up and they ask you whatever they want.

777
01:41:09,744 --> 01:41:11,425
But I think the listening session part

778
01:41:12,265 --> 01:41:25,379
which to me is like finding out from like asking targeted questions and hoping that everyone there can talk about their own experience to give you a picture of how our policies are affecting people.

779
01:41:25,840 --> 01:41:28,403
That is a part that I would love to add as a yes and thanks.

780
01:41:29,628 --> 01:41:30,309
Thank you.

781
01:41:31,249 --> 01:41:39,656
My answer, well, first, I think that I just have different standards at this point in terms of angry crowds.

782
01:41:39,936 --> 01:41:41,337
So that's one part of this.

783
01:41:41,418 --> 01:41:47,402
But no, I mean, the reason that I liked it was, I mean, you know, I saw the exact same thing that you all saw.

784
01:41:47,442 --> 01:41:49,584
There was like one person there who had gone to

785
01:41:52,166 --> 01:41:57,869
You know all the Salem Street meetings and was constantly bringing that that the RFPs up.

786
01:41:58,510 --> 01:42:06,594
And then there was another fellow who, you know, was, I never met him before but he was talking about like, you know, potholes and stuff like that.

787
01:42:08,667 --> 01:42:34,884
The reason that the reason that I liked it so much, that was one, there were people that like I'd never seen before that were asking questions, kind of like figuring other things out, even with, you know, like the one or two more angry audience members to it was in a place which is like the lunches at the senior center where the city counselors are in a place that, you know, they aren't normally necessarily going to.

788
01:42:35,844 --> 01:42:38,226
But like they're very physically like

789
01:42:39,385 --> 01:42:47,476
You know, they're, they're like, very physically present, like, people who don't normally know how to seek us out online can just kind of, like, wander in there and kind of see what's going on.

790
01:42:47,496 --> 01:42:49,679
And so that that's why I liked it.

791
01:42:49,699 --> 01:42:55,768
I think the other listening sessions, I think, were great, but it was, it was an organizational problem, kind of like, trying to.

792
01:42:56,439 --> 01:43:00,843
coordinate with community liaisons and gather everybody up for these sort of one time things.

793
01:43:01,523 --> 01:43:08,128
And I think like showing up to the senior center provides like a regular thing where people figure out that it's happening.

794
01:43:08,549 --> 01:43:16,435
And, you know, you know, I think that there there were some like it was a bit of a you know, the first ones were like, you know, a little bit bumpy, but I thought there were

795
01:43:18,214 --> 01:43:19,294
they're overall productive.

796
01:43:19,334 --> 01:43:33,739
And I think this is the kind of thing where, you know, you keep going there over time and you develop relationships there and it becomes kind of known that you can go to this, like go there at this time and kind of ask your local city councilor about something so that people know like a place to physically find you.

797
01:43:33,759 --> 01:43:37,500
And so that's what I appreciated about it because it's, it's reproducible.

798
01:43:38,060 --> 01:43:42,222
I think things calm down as you kind of like develop relationships with people and you kind of

799
01:43:43,022 --> 01:43:49,665
transition from like, somebody that somebody heard about the abstract to like a physical presence that there and you can get to know one on one.

800
01:43:50,186 --> 01:43:55,548
And that's, that's the component about it that I think that I, that I appreciated so much.

801
01:43:58,790 --> 01:43:59,410
That clarifies.

802
01:43:59,450 --> 01:44:05,213
So I think it's just, I also think it's good that like, we're kind of alternating and different counselors can go on different ways.

803
01:44:05,253 --> 01:44:06,694
So I won't be able to go to the March one.

804
01:44:07,094 --> 01:44:10,296
But I think that I just have a very different approach from the way that

805
01:44:11,121 --> 01:44:14,042
Councilor Lazar or Callahan will want to do theirs individually.

806
01:44:14,182 --> 01:44:21,583
And I look forward to, you know, hearing about how those different approaches are working or like what individuals think of those different approaches.

807
01:44:21,643 --> 01:44:27,204
That way we can like kind of compare notes and see what everybody else is sort of independently doing.

808
01:44:27,224 --> 01:44:37,286
Cause like, I'm gonna, I'll run mine my own way, but if I hear that Councilor Callahan's is going so much better than mine, I might just start adapting practices from that.

809
01:44:38,857 --> 01:44:41,158
So yeah, that's my two cents.

810
01:44:42,058 --> 01:44:45,419
I think it's just kind of different views on the same event.

811
01:44:46,319 --> 01:44:49,420
But anyway, I don't see anybody in the audience.

812
01:44:50,280 --> 01:44:53,621
So to keep things running long, let's go to the newsletter.

813
01:44:54,922 --> 01:44:56,322
Let's go to the newsletter.

814
01:44:56,442 --> 01:45:02,964
So I did send everybody here a copy of it.

815
01:45:06,852 --> 01:45:13,476
I pre formatted everything to save myself the stress of doing of doing that.

816
01:45:13,616 --> 01:45:21,180
So I apologize if moment if the edits are not as clear.

817
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:25,021
and a Google Doc as they were before.

818
01:45:26,381 --> 01:45:27,882
This is the latest draft that I have.

819
01:45:27,942 --> 01:45:30,222
Essentially what I realized, two things.

820
01:45:30,422 --> 01:45:37,225
First, on the January, we didn't cover the January 28th regular meeting, the last one, so I included that in here.

821
01:45:37,245 --> 01:45:48,228
And there wasn't too much, I think the most substantive things that happened were the McCormick Avenue and the resolution to make

822
01:45:49,898 --> 01:45:55,503
The discussion on property tax bills and the red solution to make council meetings more business friendly, which I threw in there.

823
01:45:55,523 --> 01:46:07,612
I, yes, I included the I included under general business the outcome of yesterday's charter.

824
01:46:11,002 --> 01:46:27,085
the charter draft to a regular meeting, just noting that we voted on a few technical edits as well as a change to the start of charter studies committee's proposed new council composition of eight ward-based and three at-large to four district-based and five at-large counselors.

825
01:46:27,125 --> 01:46:28,966
So just noting the outcome of that meeting.

826
01:46:28,986 --> 01:46:32,266
And also what we,

827
01:46:35,604 --> 01:46:44,472
just did just discuss an update to the human rights commission ordinance and just kind of threw the sentence in there because we just did that.

828
01:46:44,532 --> 01:46:48,315
So offer an update on this present meeting that we're currently in right at this moment.

829
01:46:50,144 --> 01:46:51,926
So yeah, Councilor Sang.

830
01:46:52,987 --> 01:46:53,347
Thank you.

831
01:46:54,088 --> 01:46:55,129
Thank you for working on this.

832
01:46:58,392 --> 01:47:05,619
Just starting with the easiest edit under public health and community safety, the discussed, I see you're underlined.

833
01:47:06,260 --> 01:47:07,221
I think there should be.

834
01:47:07,241 --> 01:47:08,202
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

835
01:47:08,222 --> 01:47:10,484
That is latex formatting.

836
01:47:10,925 --> 01:47:11,345
I figured.

837
01:47:12,186 --> 01:47:14,268
I just figured I'd bring it up in case you didn't see it.

838
01:47:14,868 --> 01:47:15,689
Thank you.

839
01:47:16,530 --> 01:47:29,061
Um, another smaller technical edit, I think, would be to, um, for the February 25th stuff on, um, yeah, up there, I might, I,

840
01:47:30,701 --> 01:47:39,587
I think the thing that most residents would be interested in is probably the bond for repairing lead sewer pipes.

841
01:47:41,729 --> 01:47:43,070
So I would probably move that up.

842
01:47:43,330 --> 01:47:51,535
And I think it could be helpful to clarify that, to note that these repairs include

843
01:47:52,436 --> 01:48:01,598
the helping like private property owners replace lead sewer pipes as well, since that's like a real difference from compared to old city policy.

844
01:48:02,818 --> 01:48:16,381
I don't know what the best phrasing for that is, but I do think that's notable enough since, you know, I think, you know, residents should also be aware that we're going to, we're going to be helping them by doing stuff on their properties as well.

845
01:48:17,722 --> 01:48:19,162
And I think that notice would be helpful.

846
01:48:20,309 --> 01:48:43,148
Okay, so I'm just coming up with specific wording which I'm doing I'll just I'll just stop sharing and reach and share the actual window that I'm that I'm looking at so you can you can see How the sausage is made Good ol latex Okay, we passed

847
01:48:43,997 --> 01:48:47,579
an $8 million bond for the DPW to repair lit sewer pipes.

848
01:48:48,259 --> 01:48:50,841
This is to help private property owners what?

849
01:48:53,963 --> 01:48:56,584
I remember DPW had the formulation for it.

850
01:48:56,684 --> 01:48:59,866
Do any of the other counselors remember how they phrased it?

851
01:49:06,149 --> 01:49:08,630
I mean, it's coverage both both sides, right?

852
01:49:08,650 --> 01:49:18,033
So it covers the city side and then also the resident side of of the pipes that they determine are lead, which is probably far fewer than we think.

853
01:49:18,893 --> 01:49:28,056
And the first part of it was going to be a study to determine which are actually lead because it was going to be less than we don't have to put all of this in the newsletter.

854
01:49:28,096 --> 01:49:29,097
I would recommend we don't.

855
01:49:30,677 --> 01:49:31,457
But the

856
01:49:34,790 --> 01:49:35,551
Let's see.

857
01:49:35,991 --> 01:49:44,318
A bond for the DPW to identify and repair lead sewer pipes.

858
01:49:44,418 --> 01:49:47,400
I would probably leave it at that.

859
01:49:48,201 --> 01:49:56,868
But you're saying you want to tell property owners that there will be funds to help reimburse them.

860
01:49:57,008 --> 01:49:59,630
Is it a reimbursement or do they get money up front?

861
01:49:59,650 --> 01:50:01,532
Neither.

862
01:50:01,632 --> 01:50:02,413
Neither, right?

863
01:50:04,484 --> 01:50:05,004
Yeah, neither.

864
01:50:05,024 --> 01:50:06,846
It's the city is going to do all the work.

865
01:50:07,346 --> 01:50:07,606
Right.

866
01:50:07,666 --> 01:50:08,727
And the city pays for it.

867
01:50:09,767 --> 01:50:10,468
You're right.

868
01:50:10,548 --> 01:50:19,254
So identify, repair, lead sewer pipes on both residential and city property.

869
01:50:21,095 --> 01:50:21,455
Oh, good.

870
01:50:21,615 --> 01:50:22,196
I think that's good.

871
01:50:24,237 --> 01:50:24,377
Good.

872
01:50:25,524 --> 01:50:29,868
So that's the only suggestion I have besides the charter stuff.

873
01:50:30,529 --> 01:50:49,487
I wonder if there's a very short way, because I think some of this charter stuff is very in the weedsy without, you know, I think like a general thing about like we talked about the role of equity and like we discussed the role of equity and

874
01:50:52,209 --> 01:50:54,332
And policymaking.

875
01:50:55,073 --> 01:50:58,657
And that led us to this these conclusions I think that would be helpful somewhere.

876
01:51:00,018 --> 01:51:04,263
Because I think absent that it's just kind of numbers swirling around.

877
01:51:07,761 --> 01:51:12,345
I know I've been in the weeds about this information, but I'm trying to put myself in the position of someone who hasn't been.

878
01:51:14,186 --> 01:51:23,994
So this is, so I think like this stuff right here, and I apologize for the lack of effectiveness, is, so this is just the stuff under the governance committee section.

879
01:51:24,034 --> 01:51:27,057
This just kind of shows like what parts we discussed.

880
01:51:27,097 --> 01:51:31,701
I feel like that could just generally be thrown out because it's,

881
01:51:33,580 --> 01:51:41,022
I mean, yeah, we discussed like multiple parts of the charter, but this is like kind of more substantively what we actually changed.

882
01:51:41,322 --> 01:51:41,702
Yeah.

883
01:51:42,162 --> 01:51:44,463
I think, I think this part.

884
01:51:46,243 --> 01:51:49,784
Oh, one note about this part is we did remove the mayor as chair of the school committee.

885
01:51:50,625 --> 01:51:55,986
Um, and I think that's, that's actually probably the biggest edit we made that night.

886
01:51:56,986 --> 01:51:59,367
Um, yeah.

887
01:51:59,387 --> 01:52:02,688
Okay.

888
01:52:03,355 --> 01:52:06,859
I do feel like like reporting the actual changes that were made.

889
01:52:07,219 --> 01:52:08,360
Oh yeah, for sure.

890
01:52:08,380 --> 01:52:13,265
I just think like sometimes without a framing of them, it can get a little lost.

891
01:52:15,367 --> 01:52:22,934
For example, for the top section, the ward based district based stuff.

892
01:52:24,852 --> 01:52:38,701
I would suggest saying after a lengthy discussion about equity access and policymaking, we voted to change the charter study committees.

893
01:52:44,212 --> 01:52:47,533
Yeah, baseline say after lengthy discussion, for sure.

894
01:52:48,613 --> 01:53:06,840
It feels well, it feels important to mention that that we like, you know, we debated and we discussed, you know, like, we discussed the research we talked about, like, we don't have to put all of this in, but we like it was thoroughly examined.

895
01:53:07,780 --> 01:53:08,480
And then we voted.

896
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:10,381
Yeah.

897
01:53:10,841 --> 01:53:12,702
Write something quickly in the zoom chat.

898
01:53:22,910 --> 01:53:45,242
And then just the rest.

899
01:53:53,827 --> 01:53:57,949
Anna's noted that her phone battery is about to die.

900
01:53:58,270 --> 01:54:01,672
Why don't we let Anna... Anna, do you have any edits you want to make before your phone dies?

901
01:54:03,252 --> 01:54:08,135
I actually really appreciated that it was formatted properly because it made it look so much more professional.

902
01:54:08,515 --> 01:54:09,316
I did read it.

903
01:54:09,816 --> 01:54:10,877
I actually thought it was fine.

904
01:54:10,957 --> 01:54:13,598
So I'm good on the newsletter.

905
01:54:13,618 --> 01:54:14,979
I will happily vote in favor.

906
01:54:16,360 --> 01:54:16,620
Cool.

907
01:54:17,220 --> 01:54:25,805
Um, I don't have any other notes besides we didn't the government governance committee didn't meet for March 4 so I would just cut that part.

908
01:54:26,285 --> 01:54:28,046
But yeah, we didn't meet on.

909
01:54:28,066 --> 01:54:29,447
Oh, oh yeah.

910
01:54:30,896 --> 01:54:32,016
Wait, hold on, sorry.

911
01:54:32,197 --> 01:54:34,538
Yeah, because we just did the Committee of the Whole instead.

912
01:54:35,418 --> 01:54:36,378
Oh, yes, right.

913
01:54:38,399 --> 01:54:40,760
Wait, this is under general business.

914
01:54:40,780 --> 01:54:46,602
On March 4th, we loaded some draft of the, that's not under governance, but this is the other governance stuff here.

915
01:54:46,623 --> 01:54:48,363
Yep.

916
01:54:48,543 --> 01:54:49,624
Is March 4th mentioned here?

917
01:54:52,005 --> 01:54:54,506
No, he's just saying they didn't meet, so he doesn't have anything to add.

918
01:54:55,406 --> 01:54:59,368
Yeah, under all of this, there's a, it says,

919
01:55:01,055 --> 01:55:01,315
Yeah.

920
01:55:01,335 --> 01:55:02,196
Do you see line 227?

921
01:55:03,277 --> 01:55:05,459
Oh, right.

922
01:55:06,259 --> 01:55:06,720
I gotcha.

923
01:55:08,381 --> 01:55:08,501
Yeah.

924
01:55:08,541 --> 01:55:14,185
And there was, I had a placekeeper there and given the lack of sleep, I left it in there.

925
01:55:14,666 --> 01:55:15,106
Yeah.

926
01:55:15,146 --> 01:55:15,627
No worries.

927
01:55:15,947 --> 01:55:16,327
Okay.

928
01:55:18,309 --> 01:55:24,894
Um, yeah, I, I don't normally edit them beforehand cause it does.

929
01:55:25,635 --> 01:55:27,876
format them beforehand because it does take a lot of time.

930
01:55:28,676 --> 01:55:29,716
Yeah.

931
01:55:29,736 --> 01:55:31,797
And this time I just wanted to get it over with.

932
01:55:34,037 --> 01:55:34,677
Is there anything else?

933
01:55:35,318 --> 01:55:35,618
Yeah.

934
01:55:35,698 --> 01:55:39,379
There's, you mentioned the compensation in earlier in the bullet points.

935
01:55:39,419 --> 01:55:41,459
I just want to make sure we say something quickly about that.

936
01:55:42,580 --> 01:55:47,081
The committee voted to adopt the study committees.

937
01:55:49,613 --> 01:55:57,720
recommendation on compensation for elected officials compensation.

938
01:56:08,370 --> 01:56:10,652
Which might I add was the thing that I proposed.

939
01:56:15,090 --> 01:56:17,992
dearly similar to the things I proposed.

940
01:56:20,193 --> 01:56:20,893
Coincidence?

941
01:56:21,093 --> 01:56:21,794
You decide.

942
01:56:23,095 --> 01:56:28,137
Everyone was so mad about it though, Anna, when you proposed it.

943
01:56:28,418 --> 01:56:33,681
They were super mad until someone on the other side proposed it and then they loved it, exactly as I said in that council meeting.

944
01:56:34,061 --> 01:56:34,781
What other side?

945
01:56:34,801 --> 01:56:35,762
There are no sides.

946
01:56:36,282 --> 01:56:37,863
You remember I was like, I was like,

947
01:56:38,451 --> 01:56:39,552
The other side of the rail.

948
01:56:39,952 --> 01:56:40,352
Never mind.

949
01:56:41,233 --> 01:56:41,873
I said what I said.

950
01:56:41,893 --> 01:56:44,255
And now I said it.

951
01:56:44,876 --> 01:56:45,536
I said it.

952
01:56:46,637 --> 01:56:56,184
Okay, I'm going to do the charters on the compensation for elected officials, additionally removed recall provisions, etc, etc.

953
01:56:56,264 --> 01:57:01,908
And set this we

954
01:57:05,933 --> 01:57:07,414
Do we need a little bit of context here?

955
01:57:07,434 --> 01:57:09,034
Because we did also discuss this for a while.

956
01:57:11,754 --> 01:57:15,855
I just, I feel like I cannot, there was so much context on all of this stuff.

957
01:57:15,975 --> 01:57:29,838
Like, I, maybe you can put something in the introduction about the edits made to the charter and that you recommend if people are interested in hearing

958
01:57:30,412 --> 01:57:38,458
the reasoning behind the edits made, that there are full YouTube videos of the- Which are all linked, every single one of them.

959
01:57:38,478 --> 01:57:42,962
Yes, that they can click the links to the YouTube videos for the full context.

960
01:57:43,462 --> 01:57:48,826
Because there's extensive discussion and everybody's reasoning is laid out.

961
01:57:48,846 --> 01:57:56,452
This is another- Yeah, I actually didn't realize the YouTube videos were linked, so that'd be really helpful to just say, and I think that would cover everything.

962
01:57:57,012 --> 01:58:24,254
actually what I was thinking was to add a disclaimer in future newsletters because there are like the print versions of this and the text versions of this so maybe like something to say like note on the on the web-based version of this we have the underlined words are links to both to YouTube videos agendas and to like live live recordings

963
01:58:25,907 --> 01:58:28,950
online agendas and other relevant items.

964
01:58:29,991 --> 01:58:30,211
Yeah.

965
01:58:30,231 --> 01:58:31,592
I don't think that hurts to mention.

966
01:58:32,233 --> 01:58:32,813
Yeah.

967
01:58:32,833 --> 01:58:33,554
That'd be super helpful.

968
01:58:33,574 --> 01:58:36,196
Cause I totally did not realize that looking at this.

969
01:58:37,257 --> 01:58:47,766
And we, I think we often have an eye toward our, our most like vulnerable folks that we're talking to, especially like in our listening sessions, maybe, or people who just aren't people who don't have computers.

970
01:58:47,786 --> 01:58:51,889
A lot of the folks at the senior center are like, I don't have a computer.

971
01:58:51,909 --> 01:58:52,510
I don't have an email.

972
01:58:53,225 --> 01:59:02,832
and we'll give out the newsletter, but then, you know, stuff like, it doesn't always occur, but even Councillor Seng is, I mean, he's very young, and he didn't realize.

973
01:59:02,852 --> 01:59:04,253
He's very smart.

974
01:59:06,235 --> 01:59:06,555
Thank you.

975
01:59:06,595 --> 01:59:07,355
I try my best.

976
01:59:09,077 --> 01:59:11,058
You wouldn't always know it from a, you know, inbox.

977
01:59:13,980 --> 01:59:20,125
Okay, so this is, this is what that looks, this is what the, note that the underlying words in this newsletter indicate

978
01:59:20,971 --> 01:59:24,192
Links to online agendas, live recordings, and other relevant resource.

979
01:59:26,473 --> 01:59:30,515
Anna, yeah.

980
01:59:32,796 --> 01:59:33,917
I move to approve with edits.

981
01:59:35,217 --> 01:59:35,577
Sorry.

982
01:59:35,637 --> 01:59:35,958
Second.

983
01:59:36,598 --> 01:59:37,278
And adjourn?

984
01:59:39,379 --> 01:59:39,539
What?

985
01:59:39,619 --> 01:59:40,059
And adjourn.

986
01:59:40,079 --> 01:59:40,760
Yes, and adjourn.

987
01:59:40,780 --> 01:59:42,000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

988
01:59:42,180 --> 01:59:43,121
Just going to do this.

989
01:59:43,141 --> 01:59:43,781
Just going to do this.

990
01:59:43,861 --> 01:59:44,241
He's not ready.

991
01:59:47,761 --> 01:59:48,021
Hold on.

992
01:59:48,161 --> 01:59:57,068
Note that underlined words in this newsletter indicate links to meeting agendas, live recordings, and other relevant resources.

993
01:59:59,010 --> 02:00:03,513
Document to subscribe to.

02:00:04,534 --> 02:00:05,435
Not technically.

995
02:00:05,455 --> 02:00:12,220
Okay.

996
02:00:14,082 --> 02:00:14,422
Second.

997
02:00:16,475 --> 02:00:18,336
Okay, Mr. Clerk, when you're ready, please call the roll.

998
02:00:25,141 --> 02:00:25,841
Councilor Callahan?

999

Yes.

1000
02:00:28,123 --> 02:00:28,903
Councilor Lozaro?

1001
02:00:29,283 --> 02:00:29,524
Yes.

1002
02:00:30,044 --> 02:00:31,165
Councilor Scarpelli is absent.

Yes.

1007
02:00:34,487 --> 02:00:37,149

The newsletter is approved.

1009
02:00:41,132 --> 02:00:44,254
