00:00:27,991 --> 00:00:28,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Present.

00:00:29,471 --> 00:00:30,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Lemme.

11
00:00:30,232 --> 00:00:30,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Present.

12
00:00:31,032 --> 00:00:31,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Councilor Scarpello.

13
00:00:34,827 --> 00:00:35,187
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

14
00:00:37,849 --> 00:00:39,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I suppose I called present.

15
00:00:41,811 --> 00:00:43,232
[SPEAKER_12]: Five present, none absent.

16
00:00:43,272 --> 00:00:44,512
[SPEAKER_12]: The meeting is called to order.

17
00:00:45,753 --> 00:00:56,199
[SPEAKER_12]: The action and discussion item for this meeting is paper 24-033 zoning ordinance updates with the Innes Associates team.

18
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,923
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, so I will just quickly summarize our agenda for this meeting, and then I'll turn it over to

19
00:01:04,083 --> 00:01:04,964
[SPEAKER_12]: our zoning consultant.

20
00:01:06,444 --> 00:01:21,230
[SPEAKER_12]: Per the plan that we agreed upon at the last time we met with our zoning consultant in the planning and permitting committee, which I believe was just two weeks ago, we decided that we would use this next meeting to review the updated zoning memo.

21
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:30,014
[SPEAKER_12]: I understand that we have some draft text for updating the definitions in our zoning ordinance, and I want to just take that opportunity to restate at this point

22
00:01:30,558 --> 00:01:46,644
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think that we're talking about making any substantial changes to the definitions or the use table, but rather taking this opportunity to modernize, incorporate suggestions for city staff for making these definitions more legible, more useful.

23
00:01:47,705 --> 00:01:59,189
[SPEAKER_12]: So we can review that, as well as the updated table of uses, which again, no substantive changes, just changing the formatting to be more useful, more readable.

24
00:02:00,355 --> 00:02:14,559
[SPEAKER_12]: We're then going to switch over into discussing some zoning strategies that are recommended in the climate action and adaptation plan and seeing how those fit into our kind of work plan for the zoning overhaul overall.

25
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:23,602
[SPEAKER_12]: And go into what we are planning to do in our next meeting two weeks from now to move all of these projects forward.

26
00:02:24,262 --> 00:02:25,183
[SPEAKER_12]: So with that,

27
00:02:26,937 --> 00:02:30,961
[SPEAKER_12]: Barring any introductory comments from Councilors, I would love to hand it over to Paula.

28
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:32,282
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for being here.

29
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:38,407
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.

30
00:02:38,727 --> 00:02:39,048
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.

31
00:02:39,448 --> 00:02:40,008
[SPEAKER_00]: Good afternoon.

32
00:02:41,249 --> 00:02:43,632
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm Paula Ramos-Martinez.

33
00:02:43,832 --> 00:02:46,634
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm representing Emily Innes from Innes Associates.

34
00:02:47,475 --> 00:02:50,017
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also have in my team Jimmy

35
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:56,824
[SPEAKER_00]: Rosha, he's our GIS specialist, and he's with us today.

36
00:02:58,165 --> 00:03:00,066
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to share my screen.

37
00:03:02,428 --> 00:03:06,252
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see if you see everything.

38
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:15,399
[SPEAKER_12]: If you could just, sorry, if you could put the microphone a little bit closer to your face.

39
00:03:15,419 --> 00:03:15,980
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, sure.

40
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,640
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

41
00:03:16,701 --> 00:03:16,901
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

42
00:03:18,547 --> 00:03:29,013
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so we are, uh, in this May 8th today, what we are mainly what we're going to do is to review a draft, um, text for the definitions.

43
00:03:29,914 --> 00:03:31,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we have some, uh,

44
00:03:33,183 --> 00:03:33,363
[SPEAKER_00]: we have.

45
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:36,504
[SPEAKER_00]: Progress that the status of the zoning memorandum.

46
00:03:36,544 --> 00:03:41,566
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a little of updates that were from last meeting.

47
00:03:42,326 --> 00:03:50,168
[SPEAKER_00]: Um we have the table of uses only to, uh, agree that it's okay and that we can send out to the city council to be approved.

48
00:03:51,069 --> 00:03:54,510
[SPEAKER_00]: We will discuss the definitions to be also sent to the city

49
00:04:03,018 --> 00:04:12,281
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will also, as chair calling said, we are going to talk about some zoning strategies from the climate action and adaption plan.

50
00:04:13,522 --> 00:04:30,788
[SPEAKER_00]: For next round, for the next meeting, we will introduce that we are working on inclusionary zoning, site plan review, accessory dwelling units, and we are working on how to do those mapping analysis that we need to do for further

51
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:34,531
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for further discussions.

52
00:04:36,912 --> 00:04:42,016
[SPEAKER_00]: On the zoning memorandum, the things that we have changed are these four points.

53
00:04:42,817 --> 00:05:04,453
[SPEAKER_00]: As President Sackberg suggested, we have proposed to have two tables in which the first table is only preparing all the strategies for phase one, all the things that we need to address in phase one, and the second table, all the proposed changes that will take place in phase two and three.

54
00:05:05,693 --> 00:05:20,359
[SPEAKER_00]: We also added a new table and that is still, at the moment it's empty, we need to fill it in with all the further studies that we think are needed for the zoning.

55
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:31,523
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also added a column for financing in case that we can register how many financing is needed for each of those studies.

56
00:05:32,204 --> 00:05:36,051
[SPEAKER_00]: and if new grants are needed or new funding is needed.

57
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:47,011
[SPEAKER_00]: We also added for recommendation B-49, the word wall to window and roof gardens.

58
00:05:47,191 --> 00:06:05,020
[SPEAKER_00]: We also added a new proposal that came from Councilor Leming, which is the proposal number B-34, which is to replace vacant and foreclosing properties ordinance with an ordinance in Chapter 10, zoning strategies, and that is something different.

59
00:06:06,761 --> 00:06:07,922
[SPEAKER_00]: with an audience in Chapter 10.

60
00:06:08,983 --> 00:06:13,765
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the changes that we have adapted in the memorandum.

61
00:06:15,706 --> 00:06:31,836
[SPEAKER_00]: And as well as if you have any new comments, we will adapt it to the next meeting and to change it into a new zoning memorandum number three that we will see because of the climate change, climate adaptation action plan.

62
00:06:32,656 --> 00:06:35,778
[SPEAKER_00]: It will bring us with some of those changes.

63
00:06:38,413 --> 00:06:41,213
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the updates of the memorandum.

64
00:06:42,974 --> 00:06:47,415
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the table of uses we presented last time it was presented by Emily.

65
00:06:47,575 --> 00:06:48,996
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing has changed with that.

66
00:06:50,756 --> 00:07:02,820
[SPEAKER_00]: What we did, it was just to add the parking numbers and the logistics into the table of uses and parking regulations that you can see in the columns yellow on the right.

67
00:07:03,718 --> 00:07:14,542
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have in these tables on the uses that you see on the reddish background, those are the definitions that we are working on.

68
00:07:15,022 --> 00:07:20,144
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to be aware that those words might change in the near future.

69
00:07:21,685 --> 00:07:25,586
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the only thing that we have done to the table of uses.

70
00:07:28,167 --> 00:07:29,468
[SPEAKER_00]: Could I interrupt you for a moment, Paula?

71
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:29,908
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

72
00:07:30,776 --> 00:07:31,016
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

73
00:07:31,056 --> 00:07:34,318
[SPEAKER_12]: On the use table, just while we're looking at it, if you want, I'm going back to that slide.

74
00:07:34,718 --> 00:07:44,342
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for flagging that the multiple dwelling class A and multiple dwelling class B. So it's my understanding that definition might change, and that's why it's highlighted.

75
00:07:45,123 --> 00:07:50,405
[SPEAKER_12]: On the right-hand side, highlighted in yellow, we have the column PC and the column LC.

76
00:07:50,805 --> 00:07:55,467
[SPEAKER_12]: Would you mind just quickly defining the column headers, what PC and LC stand for?

77
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:59,009
[SPEAKER_12]: It's parking code and then

78
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:03,347
[SPEAKER_00]: I, um, if I remember correctly, it's logistic loading.

79
00:08:03,487 --> 00:08:03,807
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.

80
00:08:03,827 --> 00:08:04,088
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.

81
00:08:04,448 --> 00:08:05,308
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, loading codes.

82
00:08:06,109 --> 00:08:09,531
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so at the moment, as I understand, these are in different tables.

83
00:08:09,851 --> 00:08:22,259
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to go, uh, that are described by some letters and you have to go into another late letter to into another table to check the letter and see how many of them you can have.

84
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,863
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, we have, uh, placed them together instead of having this

85
00:08:28,364 --> 00:08:30,328
[SPEAKER_00]: double-checking in other tables.

86
00:08:30,428 --> 00:08:31,290
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they are there.

87
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:35,761
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's just putting it all in the same table so you don't have to be flipping through and trying to match.

88
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:35,961
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

89
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:36,202
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

90
00:08:36,943 --> 00:08:37,164
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

91
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:45,273
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we have the definitions.

92
00:08:46,173 --> 00:08:53,435
[SPEAKER_00]: What we want to make very clear is that what we want to get is a discussion in here.

93
00:08:53,975 --> 00:08:58,576
[SPEAKER_00]: So not all the things that we have written or given, it's set in stone.

94
00:08:59,056 --> 00:08:59,936
[SPEAKER_00]: Those can change.

95
00:09:00,036 --> 00:09:02,877
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have any comments, that's why we are here.

96
00:09:03,117 --> 00:09:05,918
[SPEAKER_00]: We would love to have that dialogue happen today.

97
00:09:07,987 --> 00:09:18,429
[SPEAKER_00]: What I wanted to do with this page is to show what are the things that we are going to find in the document.

98
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:25,011
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we have always is we start with a term to be defined or a term to be clarified.

99
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:29,612
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the new definition that we are going to bring.

100
00:09:30,752 --> 00:09:33,533
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will be the term to define is the new definition.

101
00:09:34,153 --> 00:09:42,958
[SPEAKER_00]: And a term to be clarified is a definition that you already have, but that needs to be, or something needs to be changed or added or adjusted.

102
00:09:42,978 --> 00:09:51,623
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have our suggested definition, and that is our proposal, and it always contains the source from which that definition has been taken.

103
00:09:53,988 --> 00:10:02,414
[SPEAKER_00]: This suggested definition is what we want today to have a dialogue and check that if it's okay with all of you.

104
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:05,156
[SPEAKER_00]: We really want your feedback on it.

105
00:10:06,476 --> 00:10:15,963
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we will have, this is always if it's a term to be clarified, we will have the current definition and this is the existing that you already have in your zoning document.

106
00:10:16,824 --> 00:10:27,556
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, sometimes we have standards for use, and this means that in your definition zoning, um, there should only be a definition and not be standards.

107
00:10:27,937 --> 00:10:35,306
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to remove those standards from the definition, and those standards should appear somewhere more, uh,

108
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,303
[SPEAKER_00]: in a better place in your zoning, but not on the definition.

109
00:10:40,343 --> 00:10:42,545
[SPEAKER_00]: Definition is only what it is, and that's it.

110
00:10:43,886 --> 00:11:04,583
[SPEAKER_00]: And then some of the definitions we have find that are a bit more complex, and that we want to bring, either we want to bring more options so we can really define it, or that we need to have more conversation in order to know exactly what we want from, what we want to get from those definitions.

111
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:21,161
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I'm going to do now is go one by one of these definitions and see, so I'm going to read them and I want to ask if there are any comments, adjustments or anything that you would like to add to each of them.

112
00:11:22,711 --> 00:11:29,695
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start with replacing dwelling multiple class A and dwelling multiple class B with a single definition.

113
00:11:30,536 --> 00:11:42,063
[SPEAKER_00]: Our suggested definition is dwelling multifamily, a building with three or more residential dwelling units or two or more buildings on the same lot with more than one residential dwelling unit in each building.

114
00:11:42,783 --> 00:11:45,685
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes from the Mass General Law, Chapter 48, Section 1A.

115
00:11:48,726 --> 00:11:55,709
[SPEAKER_00]: That it comes from the mass general law does not mean that we cannot adapt it to what we would like.

116
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:03,794
[SPEAKER_00]: What the mass general law is gives us a baseline, on which obviously we cannot defer too much from it.

117
00:12:04,914 --> 00:12:05,795
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a baseline.

118
00:12:05,855 --> 00:12:11,938
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we want to define something, add something or take something out, that is possible.

119
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:17,241
[SPEAKER_00]: So are there any comments on this definition?

120
00:12:17,844 --> 00:12:18,324
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Paul.

121
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:21,305
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to go to Councilor Leming, and then I think I saw a hand from Councilor Callahan.

122
00:12:22,165 --> 00:12:27,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, this is just a general question, and this could be addressed by either Danielle or Alicia.

123
00:12:28,026 --> 00:12:34,927
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have a general question about the importance of really getting the definitions right, because it has been mentioned a few times.

124
00:12:34,968 --> 00:12:46,770
[SPEAKER_07]: So what is some of the complications and the consequence of having unclear definitions that you all have seen in the past that mean that we need to

125
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:55,847
[SPEAKER_07]: really focusing on this right now and I'm asking that mainly just to get a just to get a better understanding myself of the process.

126
00:12:58,746 --> 00:13:06,252
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I might, there are a number of different definitions here that we're bringing up for different reasons.

127
00:13:06,812 --> 00:13:21,503
[SPEAKER_01]: Some have been, if something's vague, it then becomes a matter of interpretation by the building commissioner, and over time, different people define things differently, and that's a problem because we're not being consistent over the years, right?

128
00:13:21,543 --> 00:13:24,846
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the whim of whoever is interpreting the zoning.

129
00:13:26,006 --> 00:13:38,370
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the definitions that are before you this evening are not currently uses in our use table and we think that it would make sense to be able to say where these things could be.

130
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:44,992
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the things that you'll see on the list tonight, the one that keeps sticking in my head is doggie daycare.

131
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a service?

132
00:13:47,353 --> 00:13:48,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a business?

133
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a retail?

134
00:13:49,394 --> 00:13:50,274
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not retail.

135
00:13:50,494 --> 00:13:52,835
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like not what people typically consider a service.

136
00:13:53,695 --> 00:14:02,857
[SPEAKER_01]: We have had building commissioners who consider a kennel, like an overnight storage of animals, to be a doggy daycare, to be that, even if they don't store overnight.

137
00:14:03,597 --> 00:14:05,918
[SPEAKER_01]: And so where is that allowed in our zoning?

138
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:10,319
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want to be able to say where it's allowed in our zoning, then we need a definition.

139
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:12,840
[SPEAKER_01]: And another one, a good one, is coffee shops.

140
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, a coffee shop only falls under the definition of restaurant.

141
00:14:19,421 --> 00:14:26,827
[SPEAKER_01]: you may very well have places where you want to, in your community, allow coffee shops, but not full-blown restaurants.

142
00:14:27,588 --> 00:14:42,840
[SPEAKER_01]: This is particularly happening where we have a building that's in a neighborhood that doesn't actually allow any commercial on the first floor, but we say it would be lovely to have a coffee shop there, but we actually don't want the bustle of a restaurant at that location.

143
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:48,084
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now, this is actually going on on Salem Street, there's a building,

144
00:14:48,504 --> 00:14:54,009
[SPEAKER_01]: and they are technically requesting a variance to have a restaurant on the first floor.

145
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:58,833
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have all discussed the fact that what we really want there is a coffee shop.

146
00:14:59,814 --> 00:15:02,096
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not a definition that we have.

147
00:15:02,397 --> 00:15:04,579
[SPEAKER_01]: So we literally can't give them that variance.

148
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:06,761
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's an example of why we're doing these.

149
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,763
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, the multiple dwelling,

150
00:15:10,802 --> 00:15:17,108
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an example of where the wrong things have gotten combined into definitions.

151
00:15:18,069 --> 00:15:24,674
[SPEAKER_01]: The difference between a class A and a class B multiple dwelling in Medford is whether it's three stories or four to six stories.

152
00:15:26,576 --> 00:15:41,481
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, but actually your height belongs in your dimensional table and should be about your dimensional table should say how many heights or how many stories are allowed at this location or that location, not your definition.

153
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:45,543
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea would be there would be one definition for multiple dwelling units.

154
00:15:46,303 --> 00:15:47,585
[SPEAKER_01]: or multiple dwelling buildings.

155
00:15:48,386 --> 00:15:58,639
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in our dimensional table, we'll say in this zone, they can go up to three stories, in this zone up to five, in this zone up to seven, right, whatever it is.

156
00:15:59,411 --> 00:16:01,913
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that help sort of understand why we're going through this process?

157
00:16:02,233 --> 00:16:03,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, absolutely.

158
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:21,425
[SPEAKER_07]: Just, you know, I was, I mean, having consistency across all of our zoning in terms of definitions is definitely something I understand, but I was just curious about what the real world consequences of having unclear definitions have been in the past.

159
00:16:21,585 --> 00:16:22,306
[SPEAKER_07]: So thank you.

160
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:41,272
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, if I may also, sometimes you want to define also things that you don't want to see, and that also has to be first defined in order that you can say this we don't want, or this is prohibited, or this is, you need to also define that as well.

161
00:16:41,832 --> 00:16:52,497
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes they're just too broad in order to, and you want to have more definition so that you can say yes or no as well.

162
00:16:54,386 --> 00:16:54,786
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

163
00:16:55,307 --> 00:16:56,848
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Callahan, did I see a hand up from you?

164
00:16:57,128 --> 00:16:57,268
[SPEAKER_12]: Nope.

165
00:16:57,468 --> 00:16:57,668
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

166
00:16:58,849 --> 00:17:02,492
[SPEAKER_12]: Any other comments on councilors on?

167
00:17:04,053 --> 00:17:12,399
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, did we even let you get into really the meat of the discussion on dwelling multifamily or cut you off at the beginning there?

168
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:13,720
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

169
00:17:15,809 --> 00:17:17,690
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I continue with the next one.

170
00:17:18,670 --> 00:17:20,110
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one is the doggy daycare.

171
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:29,832
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the suggested definition will be a facility providing care for dogs on a daily basis without overnight accommodation.

172
00:17:30,332 --> 00:17:36,253
[SPEAKER_00]: The facility may include indoor and outdoor areas for the dogs where they will be under supervision.

173
00:17:36,653 --> 00:17:40,514
[SPEAKER_00]: For clarity, this definition does not include animal boarding facilities.

174
00:17:42,995 --> 00:17:44,535
[SPEAKER_00]: Any comments or suggestions?

175
00:17:53,165 --> 00:17:54,346
[SPEAKER_10]: Did we feel that it was discussed?

176
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:56,207
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I had questions about the first one.

177
00:17:57,108 --> 00:17:57,328
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

178
00:17:58,088 --> 00:17:58,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, sorry.

179
00:17:58,749 --> 00:17:59,289
[SPEAKER_00]: We go back.

180
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:00,030
Yes.

181
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:13,438
[SPEAKER_10]: For the multifamily dwelling, I visited a property in Medford that was two buildings, a single family and a two family on the same property.

182
00:18:14,319 --> 00:18:16,140
[SPEAKER_10]: The owners lived in the single family, and they rented out

183
00:18:16,854 --> 00:18:17,494
[SPEAKER_10]: both those two families.

184
00:18:17,855 --> 00:18:28,620
[SPEAKER_10]: And according to this, that would not count as a multifamily dwelling because it says two or more buildings on the same lot with more than one residential dwelling unit in each building.

185
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:35,764
[SPEAKER_10]: Because one of those was a single family, that whole lot would not count as dwelling multifamily.

186
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:36,584
[SPEAKER_10]: Is that accurate?

187
00:18:39,542 --> 00:18:43,667
[SPEAKER_01]: I made that's how I read it, that would be considered to.

188
00:18:44,609 --> 00:18:49,735
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so two primary uses on one lot, a single family and a two family.

189
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:56,143
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there is an allowance in our zoning to allow two buildings on one lot.

190
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,966
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's actually also something that we need to clarify.

191
00:18:59,986 --> 00:19:03,067
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gone back and forth on, should it be allowed at all?

192
00:19:03,427 --> 00:19:04,628
[SPEAKER_01]: Should it be by special permit?

193
00:19:04,728 --> 00:19:08,010
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it two or more buildings need a special permit?

194
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:16,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the housing authority buildings are all multiple buildings, one lot, and nobody actually thinks that's a bad idea there.

195
00:19:17,755 --> 00:19:21,899
[SPEAKER_01]: So that what you're describing under this definition would not fall under it.

196
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:37,175
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually raises the question if it should be three or more units or for should be four or more in Somerville, for example, a triple a three family building a triple decker is a separate definition from a two family or a multifamily.

197
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:46,654
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have places where one to three family houses are allowed, but multiple family dwellings are not allowed.

198
00:19:50,239 --> 00:19:54,380
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one of the things where we actually should be thinking about it.

199
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:02,322
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could be adding in a definition for triple-decker or three-family house, because that's actually different.

200
00:20:02,822 --> 00:20:09,164
[SPEAKER_01]: We literally have houses that, if you drive by, look like a house, a very large house.

201
00:20:09,604 --> 00:20:12,124
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you dig, there are four or six units.

202
00:20:12,404 --> 00:20:16,325
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one up here that I'm actually, there are 15 meters on the side of it.

203
00:20:16,425 --> 00:20:17,926
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm actually curious.

204
00:20:17,986 --> 00:20:19,046
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep meaning to look it up.

205
00:20:19,526 --> 00:20:21,569
[SPEAKER_01]: and see how many units are actually inside.

206
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:23,753
[SPEAKER_01]: So does that help?

207
00:20:23,933 --> 00:20:24,414
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah.

208
00:20:24,454 --> 00:20:27,318
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wondering

209
00:20:33,223 --> 00:20:42,708
[SPEAKER_08]: with the Somerville definitions if they ended up changing it or not, because if we're relying on the state definition, which I was curious why they used multifamily.

210
00:20:42,728 --> 00:20:48,691
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought we were trying to get away from family, and then they went ahead and wrote it into law family, instead of multiple dwelling.

211
00:20:48,711 --> 00:20:51,312
[SPEAKER_08]: So here we are with family.

212
00:20:53,633 --> 00:21:00,277
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a good question, because if we're gonna use the state's definition, then we have to think of how we wanna treat that.

213
00:21:02,315 --> 00:21:11,800
[SPEAKER_10]: So I guess if I could just finish up my question, I'm just curious, like, how much do we need to hash these out here in this meeting?

214
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:22,105
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is, like, before we officially agree on these definitions, like, at what point are we, like, sitting down and saying, okay, do we think that, you know, this is the definition that we want?

215
00:21:22,185 --> 00:21:23,606
[SPEAKER_10]: Or do we want it to be more like some rules?

216
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Or do we, like, when is that appropriate time for us?

217
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:26,267
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

218
00:21:26,487 --> 00:21:27,968
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a couple of stages here.

219
00:21:28,644 --> 00:21:30,786
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a perfectly good stage to do that.

220
00:21:32,328 --> 00:21:48,304
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also so things that are like I've been saying today I've been explaining this process to people, things that get the thumbs up today and that sounds pretty good will then be on the city council agenda next week, and then refer to the Community Development Board for review.

221
00:21:49,205 --> 00:21:52,991
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it'll come back to the city council for a final public hearing.

222
00:21:53,511 --> 00:22:05,508
[SPEAKER_01]: My recommendation is that we don't want to make major changes at that final city council meeting, because if it's a very significant change then technically it has to be re advertised and go back to the CD board right.

223
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:26,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so at this meeting next week's meeting is fine The other thing that you should consider as a tool is in some cases and i'm not necessarily saying this one You might want to flag something and say we would like the planning boards the community development board's opinion on this one Um, and we would like to hear what they have to say on it.

224
00:22:27,322 --> 00:22:31,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Um Because they will have to have a public hearing on it um

225
00:22:32,378 --> 00:22:34,459
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of these sort of subjective.

226
00:22:34,539 --> 00:22:35,959
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I actually agree.

227
00:22:36,199 --> 00:22:41,001
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't pick up on that earlier for the word family, that we're trying to strike the word family.

228
00:22:41,982 --> 00:23:00,208
[SPEAKER_01]: But dwelling like, I mean, unless in some case you wanted to put in parentheses something like formally known as multifamily, so that somebody who's confused would say, oh, OK, they're actively not using that word.

229
00:23:03,663 --> 00:23:08,186
[SPEAKER_12]: I would say, if I may, just to reinforce, I think that we have a lot of definitions to update.

230
00:23:08,206 --> 00:23:10,027
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that some of these are still under review.

231
00:23:10,067 --> 00:23:14,930
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that on some, there was a recommendation to run them by the building department for further input.

232
00:23:14,990 --> 00:23:18,772
[SPEAKER_12]: I also know that we're trying to move things along efficiently.

233
00:23:18,792 --> 00:23:24,836
[SPEAKER_12]: We're also trying to bundle things so that it's not a constant stream of zoning updates through the city council to the CDB.

234
00:23:25,256 --> 00:23:26,857
[SPEAKER_12]: But that being said, we have a lot to work through.

235
00:23:28,362 --> 00:23:37,446
[SPEAKER_12]: Any thoughts that can be at least preliminarily aired at this meeting, the sooner we can get out all of our discussion topics and work through them towards a resolution, the better.

236
00:23:37,486 --> 00:23:40,987
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think I'm really glad that you flagged that, Planner Evans.

237
00:23:41,027 --> 00:23:56,894
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that if we're, I'd like for us to be contemplating something like dwelling multi-household, even if there is an asterisk somewhere in the definition, because towards the goal of consistency, if we're trying to eradicate that elsewhere in our zoning language, I think we should be doing that from the top.

238
00:23:57,657 --> 00:23:58,137
[SPEAKER_12]: President Bears?

239
00:23:58,938 --> 00:23:59,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

240
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:02,200
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think, I don't think we should use the word dwelling or family.

241
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,782
[SPEAKER_05]: We should just say unit.

242
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:11,867
[SPEAKER_05]: And we should, I think we should just define it as one unit on a lot, two units on a lot, three units on a lot, four units on a lot, four plus maybe.

243
00:24:12,048 --> 00:24:12,348
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

244
00:24:12,408 --> 00:24:13,248
[SPEAKER_05]: And just leave it at that.

245
00:24:13,329 --> 00:24:17,792
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we avoid, yeah, like, you know, it's one unit, two units, three units, four units.

246
00:24:18,032 --> 00:24:19,293
[SPEAKER_05]: There's three units on that lot.

247
00:24:19,753 --> 00:24:20,754
[SPEAKER_05]: They'd fall under the three unit.

248
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:27,239
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, they're probably going to end up in some, I don't think, I think they're still going to be outside of the zone and they're going to be a nonconforming

249
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,964
[SPEAKER_05]: Situation but that's how I would just do it because I think multi-unit solves the problem.

250
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:37,367
[SPEAKER_05]: I just the word dwelling Kind of a weird word.

251
00:24:37,887 --> 00:24:40,269
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, maybe avoid dw words

252
00:24:41,516 --> 00:24:42,457
[SPEAKER_05]: It just sounds funky.

253
00:24:43,517 --> 00:24:45,438
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only like five or six of them in the English language.

254
00:24:46,258 --> 00:24:48,520
[SPEAKER_05]: But I just think that solves that problem.

255
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:52,622
[SPEAKER_05]: And it also solves the problem that we have of like, I don't know what this means right now.

256
00:24:53,702 --> 00:24:55,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Detached single family, attached single family.

257
00:24:55,263 --> 00:24:58,905
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I kind of know what it means after having looked into it and worked on it for several years.

258
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:06,089
[SPEAKER_05]: Detached two family versus attached multiple dwelling class A, class B. I mean, the class A, class B,

259
00:25:07,250 --> 00:25:25,680
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it might be worth maintaining a separate definition in the short term, because one of them is more, I think, targeted towards like what Alicia was talking about, the four to 10 and maybe occasionally 15 units, smaller buildings where you have a lot of units inside, like what looks to be a more standard residential structure.

260
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:34,425
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the class B is the less than six stories or 75 feet, which is kind of more the bigger Lumiere type thing.

261
00:25:34,565 --> 00:25:35,826
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, right now,

262
00:25:37,113 --> 00:25:58,019
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's particularly clear that that's what's happening, but we kind of have two single family definitions with the two family attack, and then like a two family and a three family, and then like a small multifamily and a big multifamily, but I think we could just change that in the, and maybe we don't do that right now to all of them, but we could at least do the multiple dwelling to say,

263
00:26:00,271 --> 00:26:02,952
[SPEAKER_05]: x number of units on a lot.

264
00:26:03,672 --> 00:26:10,575
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe class A is 4 to 10, even though it doesn't really align with the definition, because the definition right now is, where is it?

265
00:26:12,336 --> 00:26:17,958
[SPEAKER_05]: A building or structure containing three or more not over three stories in height is technically what class A is.

266
00:26:18,038 --> 00:26:24,081
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the second one is three or more not containing not over six stories in height, which I think also

267
00:26:24,977 --> 00:26:27,359
[SPEAKER_05]: but not including group of three or more attached single family dwellings.

268
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:30,141
[SPEAKER_05]: So that excludes the three family triple decker.

269
00:26:31,062 --> 00:26:47,415
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I think it might be worth at least saying four or more units on a lot for, uh, but not over three stories in height and then four or more units in a lot, not over six stories in height, something like that in the short term.

270
00:26:47,596 --> 00:26:53,841
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in the longterm we should just move away from everything that we have right now and kind of try to redefine it more in a,

271
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:59,744
[SPEAKER_05]: in a clearer way just to talk about how many units are present on a lot.

272
00:27:00,845 --> 00:27:10,574
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think at the larger levels, we'll end up in situations where that's not actually the best way to describe the structure as well, like I think we might want to talk about.

273
00:27:11,315 --> 00:27:14,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually, in some sense, for large multi-unit buildings, I think

274
00:27:17,008 --> 00:27:21,089
[SPEAKER_05]: we may be in a better place to talk about them in terms of stories versus in terms of units.

275
00:27:21,609 --> 00:27:38,572
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I think that might be something maybe we look at down the road, but that might be a way to at least get us towards some more, uh, household type neutral and also clear, like plain English definition.

276
00:27:40,592 --> 00:27:41,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

277
00:27:41,132 --> 00:27:43,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, what we are,

278
00:27:44,895 --> 00:28:02,825
[SPEAKER_01]: proposing here is to take all the dimensional pieces out of the definition and put the dimensional pieces only in a dimensional table so that this would be multi-unit buildings with three or more residential units.

279
00:28:04,235 --> 00:28:12,078
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we wanted to control, is it a big building or a little building, we would say in this zone, you're allowed to have big buildings.

280
00:28:12,138 --> 00:28:24,604
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that zone, you're allowed to have small buildings by having those things in the dimensional table, which we're not proposing to change today, but we definitely want to be changing.

281
00:28:24,624 --> 00:28:25,884
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

282
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:27,405
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we did that though,

283
00:28:28,387 --> 00:28:30,147
[SPEAKER_01]: would it break our current zoning?

284
00:28:30,988 --> 00:28:45,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so that's actually an interesting question, and we should just check before we forward it that it's not going to, because right now there are, that's why we brought our big books with us.

285
00:28:47,432 --> 00:28:49,912
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a use that's not defined.

286
00:28:50,212 --> 00:28:51,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and it's actually.

287
00:28:51,413 --> 00:28:57,214
[SPEAKER_05]: Three or more dwelling structure has a separate residential use and it's under,

288
00:28:58,266 --> 00:29:00,768
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll leave it to you, but it's attached single family dwelling.

289
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:03,530
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

290
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:18,722
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we look at the use table, which says which zones they're in, we have detached single family, attached single, this is what you were reading from, three or more dwelling structure, attached single families and three or more dwelling.

291
00:29:19,222 --> 00:29:22,245
[SPEAKER_01]: That I think is supposed to be row houses.

292
00:29:23,185 --> 00:29:26,148
[SPEAKER_05]: I take it as just attached units, whether it's up and down or side to side.

293
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:31,015
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's supposed to mean a triple-decker.

294
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:31,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

295
00:29:32,175 --> 00:29:39,699
[SPEAKER_01]: Because their attached single-family dwelling is the header, and then there are two types, two dwellings or three or more.

296
00:29:39,719 --> 00:29:40,680
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

297
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:54,947
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's supposed to be row houses, and then detached two-family dwelling could only possibly mean two single-family houses on one property.

298
00:29:54,967 --> 00:29:55,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

299
00:29:57,045 --> 00:30:08,288
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really an interesting- That's why that definition under attached single family dwelling has me think that the two dwelling structure is also a two family stacked as well as a row house.

300
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:11,949
[SPEAKER_01]: I see what you're saying.

301
00:30:11,969 --> 00:30:13,290
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise there's no definition.

302
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:17,951
[SPEAKER_01]: So those definitions also really need to be fixed.

303
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:20,852
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you looking to see if we have those definitions in the book?

304
00:30:22,608 --> 00:30:24,109
[SPEAKER_09]: Things aren't always what you think they are.

305
00:30:24,129 --> 00:30:26,331
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.

306
00:30:26,431 --> 00:30:32,755
[SPEAKER_09]: I spent a long time looking for lot coverage, and it wasn't with all the other lot stuff.

307
00:30:32,815 --> 00:30:36,077
[SPEAKER_09]: It was coverage of lots off by itself.

308
00:30:36,838 --> 00:30:41,721
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so right, so the definitions are, I must use them a lot.

309
00:30:41,961 --> 00:30:51,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Dwelling single-family attached, an attached residential building intended and designed to contain multiple, or to contain or containing one dwelling unit.

310
00:30:54,557 --> 00:30:57,219
[SPEAKER_01]: The heck does that mean?

311
00:30:57,379 --> 00:31:03,763
[SPEAKER_01]: An attached residential building intended and designed to contain one dwelling unit.

312
00:31:04,184 --> 00:31:05,384
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, that's a row house.

313
00:31:07,306 --> 00:31:14,491
[SPEAKER_01]: Dwelling single family detached, a detached residential building intended and designed to contain one dwelling unit.

314
00:31:15,632 --> 00:31:17,393
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a single family house.

315
00:31:17,493 --> 00:31:17,713
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

316
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:25,337
[SPEAKER_01]: dwelling two family, a detached residential building intended and designed to contain two dwelling units.

317
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:35,043
[SPEAKER_01]: So that implies that that is, so I'm gonna just point out that that definition does not match what's in our use table, which is one of our problems.

318
00:31:35,123 --> 00:31:46,790
[SPEAKER_05]: And neither does the three family in the use table, which to me is only existing as an exception to the dwelling multiple definition in the clause after the work, but not including a group of three or more attached single family dwellings.

319
00:31:48,686 --> 00:31:50,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

320
00:31:50,546 --> 00:31:51,446
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's where that.

321
00:31:52,907 --> 00:32:13,750
[SPEAKER_01]: So what it really seems to me is that the answer here is that we actually need to ask NSAssociates to take these definitions, this section of definitions from our current definition section and the words in the use table, and to come back with proposed language for each of them.

322
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:17,751
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, so that we don't mess things up,

323
00:32:19,232 --> 00:32:29,361
[SPEAKER_01]: while we weren't really getting into what zones they're allowed in, match them to zones so that we update the use table with these names and the definitions at the same time.

324
00:32:30,763 --> 00:32:33,505
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, we'll break stuff in the meantime.

325
00:32:33,845 --> 00:32:34,366
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

326
00:32:34,386 --> 00:32:35,287
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

327
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:41,653
[SPEAKER_05]: And the only question I have there is I think it's actually all pretty easy, which is that the single family,

328
00:32:42,594 --> 00:32:49,996
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at the use table, the single family detached is allowed basically everywhere except apartment 3A commercial and office.

329
00:32:50,876 --> 00:32:54,637
[SPEAKER_05]: The two families are allowed in general residence plus apartments.

330
00:32:54,897 --> 00:32:57,457
[SPEAKER_05]: Three families are allowed in apartments only.

331
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:04,399
[SPEAKER_05]: Detached two-family building, which I don't really understand what that is.

332
00:33:04,479 --> 00:33:05,599
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one that confuses me.

333
00:33:06,239 --> 00:33:09,080
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it looks like if it's under three stories but more than

334
00:33:11,462 --> 00:33:18,308
[SPEAKER_05]: three units, but not a triple-decker, that's allowed in apartment one, apartment two, apartment three, and commercial one.

335
00:33:19,009 --> 00:33:24,614
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it's more than three units, but between three and six stories, that's allowed in apartment two, apartment three, and commercial one.

336
00:33:25,094 --> 00:33:30,099
[SPEAKER_10]: I found the detached two-unit is Philadelphia-style, because it doesn't share the walls.

337
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,182
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it not actually?

338
00:33:34,343 --> 00:33:35,003
[SPEAKER_05]: Like top?

339
00:33:35,183 --> 00:33:35,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Top-bottom.

340
00:33:36,525 --> 00:33:37,245
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that detached?

341
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:41,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I don't know what Philadelphia style means.

342
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:42,401
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry, above and below.

343
00:33:42,621 --> 00:33:45,803
[SPEAKER_10]: Philadelphia style just means there's one room of the first floor on the second.

344
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:47,123
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, that doesn't matter.

345
00:33:47,163 --> 00:33:49,445
[SPEAKER_10]: But like above and below, I thought was detached.

346
00:33:50,085 --> 00:33:52,506
[SPEAKER_10]: And duplex is attached.

347
00:33:53,587 --> 00:33:57,809
[SPEAKER_00]: So duplex doesn't necessarily have to be semi-detached.

348
00:33:57,949 --> 00:33:59,950
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is that you share only one wall.

349
00:34:01,891 --> 00:34:06,814
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have, and for example, in Somerville, they have the semi-detached single

350
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:10,826
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have this kind of duplex where it's one next to the other.

351
00:34:11,928 --> 00:34:16,752
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one is the duplex and the duplex can be one on top or one next to each other.

352
00:34:17,753 --> 00:34:25,862
[SPEAKER_00]: But because it's one lot, duplex is meant to be detached because you are not sharing with any other.

353
00:34:26,462 --> 00:34:31,948
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can be duplex and be detached being one next to the other or one on top.

354
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,683
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're in one lot.

355
00:34:34,064 --> 00:34:34,844
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only one lot.

356
00:34:35,324 --> 00:34:35,884
[SPEAKER_00]: On the same lot.

357
00:34:36,124 --> 00:34:36,644
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.

358
00:34:36,864 --> 00:34:39,325
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, if you're in two, semi-detached.

359
00:34:39,765 --> 00:34:39,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

360
00:34:41,186 --> 00:34:43,667
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is where I think it just gets.

361
00:34:44,667 --> 00:34:57,091
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what we want to propose in Medford, and I'm just spitballing, I can be argued with, is that we need a definition for single unit building, which would be the traditional single family house.

362
00:34:57,831 --> 00:35:00,892
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a definition for a two unit building,

363
00:35:01,916 --> 00:35:10,844
[SPEAKER_01]: do we, two unit dwelling, do we actually care whether they're side by side or on top of each other in this?

364
00:35:10,904 --> 00:35:18,872
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a definition for three unit, and then a definition for multi unit, which would be four or more units.

365
00:35:20,133 --> 00:35:20,273
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

366
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:44,174
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we let the, we might have other design standards in some other piece of this or some other document that might talk about slanted roofs versus flat or whatever, but that would be, if you were saying in this zone, we wanna allow one unit, two unit, three unit buildings, in this zone, we wanna allow multi-unit buildings.

367
00:35:44,753 --> 00:35:46,975
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, would that be sufficient for our purposes?

368
00:35:46,995 --> 00:35:53,942
[SPEAKER_05]: I think in the interim, I think like to pass something that clarifies this issue without breaking the zoning, yes.

369
00:35:54,023 --> 00:36:04,513
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the only thing that comes in there is that there is on the four plus, and I guess arguably on the three plus right now, and that's where I think we should have a three.

370
00:36:05,794 --> 00:36:11,618
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not clear to me exactly what the intent of the existing table of uses is when it comes to a three-unit building.

371
00:36:12,458 --> 00:36:20,564
[SPEAKER_05]: Other than that, if for some reason there was a three-unit building that was over three stories or under six stories, that it wouldn't be allowed in an apartment one district.

372
00:36:21,144 --> 00:36:33,952
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the only thing I think where there's a potential conflict that comes in is if we do a four-plus definition, it looks like it would need to be split between something that's four-plus and under three stories and four-plus and over three stories so that

373
00:36:35,728 --> 00:36:40,410
[SPEAKER_05]: between three and six stories, so that that second grouping wasn't in the apartment one district.

374
00:36:40,450 --> 00:36:47,872
[SPEAKER_05]: Just if we're not actually trying to change that right now, if we're trying to correct an issue, but not trying to change the policy of what's allowed where.

375
00:36:53,094 --> 00:36:55,055
[SPEAKER_01]: I was trying to think.

376
00:36:58,056 --> 00:37:01,377
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have any apartment three districts currently in the city of Medford.

377
00:37:01,397 --> 00:37:04,058
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's one apartment two district.

378
00:37:07,146 --> 00:37:10,308
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to actually check that, because that might simplify this whole thing.

379
00:37:10,768 --> 00:37:21,615
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other is that we could then just confirm that the dimensional table actually, it's in here for reference, I think.

380
00:37:21,835 --> 00:37:25,197
[SPEAKER_01]: It is in here for reference, but there were no changes proposed to it.

381
00:37:25,777 --> 00:37:30,901
[SPEAKER_01]: But the, I was looking at it today.

382
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:33,162
[SPEAKER_01]: Please don't get me started on the dimensional table.

383
00:37:38,939 --> 00:37:43,201
[SPEAKER_12]: While we're looking, I just want to recognize Attorney Silverstein who might be able to chime in on this topic.

384
00:37:43,221 --> 00:37:46,303
Thank you.

385
00:37:48,084 --> 00:37:49,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, thank you, Councilor Collins.

386
00:37:50,646 --> 00:37:56,569
[SPEAKER_06]: I just wanted to make the point back to the discussion about detached versus attached.

387
00:37:57,853 --> 00:38:09,297
[SPEAKER_06]: that there is a definition in the current ordinance for building detached, which is a principal building, which is substantially separated by yards or courts from any other principal structure.

388
00:38:10,017 --> 00:38:19,460
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think just to clarify the question about what a two-unit dwelling detached would be, I think it would be

389
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:35,834
[SPEAKER_06]: two-unit building, whether it's one over one or one next to one, where there's some other principal structure on the site, whether it's another two-unit or single-unit or commercial structure on the site.

390
00:38:46,404 --> 00:39:01,872
[SPEAKER_10]: might I suggest that we go through all these other terms that are maybe a little bit, require a little bit less discussion and see if we can get through some, and then we can come back to this, you know, multi-unit definition, which may require more discussion.

391
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:09,696
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, also to say that if we have a lot of questions about one of these definitions, we can come back next time.

392
00:39:09,716 --> 00:39:11,757
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have to be passed today.

393
00:39:12,509 --> 00:39:15,271
[SPEAKER_00]: and so that we can present with a lot more information.

394
00:39:15,351 --> 00:39:18,834
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that all these discussions are very, very interesting.

395
00:39:19,635 --> 00:39:24,679
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, our goal would be not to break everything in the process.

396
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:37,010
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have a lot of comments, then this is taken out from it, from this stack at the moment, and we will come back next time with it so that we don't have to pass anything today.

397
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:49,641
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I also just want to note, you know, I know that there's many other definitions on this document today that have research outstanding that your team is still looking into that we're waiting for feedback on.

398
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:56,188
[SPEAKER_12]: Before we move on to the next one, I just want to pause, I know that we might have been like hot on the trail of a couple

399
00:39:57,298 --> 00:39:59,641
[SPEAKER_12]: thoughts to follow up on, I'm happy to give this a couple more minutes.

400
00:40:00,101 --> 00:40:04,286
[SPEAKER_12]: I do feel fairly confident this is one of the more complicated ones on our document today.

401
00:40:04,327 --> 00:40:13,998
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that this discussion will take up the bulk of our time, regardless of if it's at the beginning or the end, but I'm happy to defer to the enthusiasm of this body.

402
00:40:14,579 --> 00:40:16,742
[SPEAKER_12]: If we come back to it, go for it.

403
00:40:17,867 --> 00:40:26,793
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think on this one, we're pulling a thread, and it's like a thread in a definition that's now a thread in the use table that's going to end up being a thread in the dimensional table.

404
00:40:27,433 --> 00:40:34,978
[SPEAKER_05]: And I almost wonder if it makes more sense for us to not fix the definition and just as part of this process.

405
00:40:35,618 --> 00:40:41,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, I think we're just going to end up creating two work buckets, which is like we're going to figure out a better way to say what we're already doing.

406
00:40:41,942 --> 00:40:44,124
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's going to take a bunch of working time.

407
00:40:44,624 --> 00:40:45,605
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're going to change it again.

408
00:40:46,502 --> 00:40:47,462
[SPEAKER_05]: to what we want it to be.

409
00:40:47,823 --> 00:40:52,424
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just wonder if it might be better to just do the second part.

410
00:40:52,604 --> 00:40:56,146
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually was thinking similarly, but not exactly.

411
00:40:56,606 --> 00:41:06,830
[SPEAKER_01]: What if we add in a bunch of definitions, maybe this coming week, or maybe in a few weeks, and then later remove the old definitions?

412
00:41:07,332 --> 00:41:08,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that make sense?

413
00:41:08,333 --> 00:41:16,179
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea being we're putting a bunch of definitions, as you'll see, into our definition section that will not be in the use table.

414
00:41:16,879 --> 00:41:21,302
[SPEAKER_01]: In this later effort, we will add them into our use table in appropriate places.

415
00:41:21,362 --> 00:41:23,504
[SPEAKER_01]: We might realign maps and stuff like that.

416
00:41:24,004 --> 00:41:27,767
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea would be to like create some definitions before we start using them.

417
00:41:28,448 --> 00:41:28,608
[SPEAKER_01]: So.

418
00:41:29,218 --> 00:41:37,966
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not sure, we still need, I think we're right though, we need them to come back with several definitions and it's not just the multi-dwelling, multi-unit that needs it.

419
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:49,916
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not opposed to it, I just would not want to also create a situation where they're not sure which, you know, which definition applies to which use of dimensional requirement.

420
00:41:50,516 --> 00:41:51,277
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

421
00:41:51,457 --> 00:41:52,238
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't, you know.

422
00:41:53,527 --> 00:41:56,793
[SPEAKER_05]: But in any case, I just wanted to quickly also ask a process question.

423
00:41:57,294 --> 00:41:57,795
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fine.

424
00:41:57,815 --> 00:41:59,258
[SPEAKER_05]: We can kind of circle back to this.

425
00:41:59,298 --> 00:42:05,249
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we'll just rest on and go through some of the easier definitions and our brains will work better, at least mine.

426
00:42:08,328 --> 00:42:12,609
[SPEAKER_05]: is the idea tonight to, so I remember we were talking about basically a few things.

427
00:42:12,649 --> 00:42:22,171
[SPEAKER_05]: We wanted to do definite, basically the first bucket of work was definitions, a site plan review, update to level site plan review language, and then some updates to the use table.

428
00:42:22,832 --> 00:42:36,195
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of what we're talking about tonight is the intention to report out from here to the regular council for next week's meeting some of those definitions and some of the use table changes so that that can start going to CD board.

429
00:42:36,255 --> 00:42:37,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that kind of where we're,

430
00:42:38,527 --> 00:42:39,208
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that where we're at?

431
00:42:40,369 --> 00:42:56,742
[SPEAKER_12]: I am coming into the meeting with kind of framing a similar question in my mind, because it's my impression that we have parts of this first bucket that are easily reportable and then others that are still not pending, but there's like one or two small steps that still need to be made.

432
00:42:58,163 --> 00:43:00,465
[SPEAKER_12]: Like it's my understanding, for example, that the table of uses is

433
00:43:01,590 --> 00:43:03,471
[SPEAKER_12]: updated, things have been swapped in, that's good to go.

434
00:43:03,491 --> 00:43:10,134
[SPEAKER_12]: The definitions, I think some of these are easy, some of them are not, some of them are just waiting for feedback on, so that's kind of half and half.

435
00:43:11,455 --> 00:43:30,825
[SPEAKER_12]: The GIS zoning map is something that I think could possibly also be part of that first packet, and I'm not sure the status on that, so I think it's a question of do we want to, do we wanna pass something through the council, CD back to the council, that then kind of has a second half that's a couple weeks behind it, or should we?

436
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:43,905
[SPEAKER_12]: have this discussion and wait until we can package all of the definitions together with the table of uses, maybe with site plan review, if that's ready in a couple of weeks, and the GIS zoning map.

437
00:43:45,386 --> 00:43:53,290
[SPEAKER_12]: I think one of our earlier conversations was around CDB capacity for not trying to load the schedule with multiple meetings.

438
00:43:54,371 --> 00:43:58,373
[SPEAKER_12]: And that is kind of, to me, that's part of the decision on my mind.

439
00:43:59,878 --> 00:44:04,463
[SPEAKER_05]: And just to clarify as well, maybe it's the clerk or Alicia or Danielle or all of you really.

440
00:44:06,124 --> 00:44:11,550
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's say we went with the second option and we said, we're not going to report anything out tonight.

441
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:12,951
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have a meeting on the 22nd.

442
00:44:12,991 --> 00:44:18,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully, we'll have the actual draft ordinance language for everything relatively in a place.

443
00:44:18,998 --> 00:44:21,480
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe Scott will have had a chance to take a look at some of it.

444
00:44:23,615 --> 00:44:28,623
[SPEAKER_05]: If we were to port that out of here, then it'd be in council on the 28th, then we'd refer out to community development board.

445
00:44:28,904 --> 00:44:34,413
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 14 days that it has to be advertised for CD board and then another 14 days for the council, right?

446
00:44:35,395 --> 00:44:37,338
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be advertised in parallel.

447
00:44:37,796 --> 00:44:40,259
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we were doing to simplify things before.

448
00:44:40,779 --> 00:44:44,444
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would produce one ad that lists both dates.

449
00:44:45,064 --> 00:44:53,334
[SPEAKER_05]: And so could we have an ad that goes out that the Community Development Board would consider it at some point in June, and then we could consider it at our June 25th meeting?

450
00:44:53,374 --> 00:44:56,757
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that enough time if we were to refer it to Community Development Board on May 28th?

451
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:15,112
[SPEAKER_01]: When we knew things were coming, we actually placed the ad before you literally referred it because we knew that so when it's going to the city council, you don't have it at that point, right?

452
00:45:15,152 --> 00:45:19,115
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's put on that agenda, it's a required referral.

453
00:45:19,595 --> 00:45:23,098
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know, oh, it's been submitted to the city council for their agenda.

454
00:45:23,478 --> 00:45:24,559
[SPEAKER_01]: They have no choice.

455
00:45:24,579 --> 00:45:26,020
[SPEAKER_01]: They must legally refer it.

456
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:31,061
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've gone ahead and placed the advertisement in advance in order to move things through more quickly.

457
00:45:31,741 --> 00:45:40,243
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we together agreed on the dates that worked, we certainly could get the ads out before the actual referral.

458
00:45:40,343 --> 00:45:43,663
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Daniel's looking at our schedule for CD board meetings.

459
00:45:46,364 --> 00:45:46,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

460
00:45:47,984 --> 00:45:49,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know when are our meetings?

461
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:50,665
[SPEAKER_08]: 5th and the 26th in June.

462
00:45:53,089 --> 00:45:58,253
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so it would have to go on the CD board meeting of the 5th to come back here.

463
00:45:58,273 --> 00:46:08,061
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you referred it out, if we knew you were going to refer it out the 28th, we would just do the math and we would just advertise it.

464
00:46:08,081 --> 00:46:09,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

465
00:46:11,284 --> 00:46:11,364
[SPEAKER_01]: Um.

466
00:46:13,362 --> 00:46:20,330
[SPEAKER_01]: because the other option is the 14th, so you meet the 14th and the 28th.

467
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:22,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, of May?

468
00:46:22,792 --> 00:46:23,233
[SPEAKER_01]: Of May.

469
00:46:23,473 --> 00:46:23,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

470
00:46:24,874 --> 00:46:30,641
[SPEAKER_05]: So the other option would be try to get some stuff out the door tonight, but I think that we might be better off personally.

471
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:46,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Going through these definitions, saying which ones we're comfortable with just as a checkbox, coming back in two weeks with some edits to the definitions, hopefully having the site plan review framework draft also in two weeks, maybe even the GIS zoning map.

472
00:46:47,261 --> 00:46:51,224
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if we have the definitions, we probably also have the use table changes.

473
00:46:52,025 --> 00:46:53,106
[SPEAKER_05]: So then we could do that all at once.

474
00:46:57,789 --> 00:46:57,970
Too small.

475
00:46:57,990 --> 00:46:58,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Too small.

476
00:47:05,882 --> 00:47:15,408
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the one thing we were just sort of thinking about is we have been sending these memos and stuff to the CD board so that nothing should be a surprise.

477
00:47:16,489 --> 00:47:28,236
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is easier to think about a smaller group and then get another smaller group rather than getting like three hours worth, you know, three hours meetings worth of materials all in one night.

478
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:34,776
[SPEAKER_01]: The board is meeting both nights anyhow.

479
00:47:35,577 --> 00:47:36,819
[SPEAKER_01]: So right.

480
00:47:37,661 --> 00:47:40,505
[SPEAKER_05]: The both nights being the 5th and the 26th of June.

481
00:47:41,046 --> 00:47:41,747
[SPEAKER_01]: And right.

482
00:47:41,887 --> 00:47:46,274
[SPEAKER_01]: If you referred it out the 15th, could we even get it on there any earlier?

483
00:47:48,251 --> 00:47:51,254
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if they were referred it at the 14th, the first.

484
00:47:51,594 --> 00:47:57,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, actually the first CD board meeting after your 14th meeting is the 15th of May.

485
00:47:57,199 --> 00:47:58,941
[SPEAKER_01]: So no, we wouldn't get it.

486
00:47:59,061 --> 00:48:02,184
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't because we don't have a legal amount.

487
00:48:02,264 --> 00:48:06,007
[SPEAKER_01]: So our next CD board meeting is the June 5th meeting anyhow, right?

488
00:48:06,087 --> 00:48:06,788
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't matter.

489
00:48:06,948 --> 00:48:07,709
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't matter.

490
00:48:07,769 --> 00:48:11,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Both packets would show up at the same meeting anyhow on June 5th.

491
00:48:11,593 --> 00:48:13,955
[SPEAKER_05]: And if they were to want to the 26th, we could.

492
00:48:15,427 --> 00:48:17,588
[SPEAKER_05]: either open or re-advertise for our July meeting.

493
00:48:17,608 --> 00:48:21,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, you can always open the hearing and then continue it.

494
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:22,630
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, yeah.

495
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:25,912
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, I think that's the way to go, personally.

496
00:48:25,932 --> 00:48:26,312
[SPEAKER_12]: Packager?

497
00:48:26,752 --> 00:48:26,932
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

498
00:48:27,373 --> 00:48:27,733
[SPEAKER_12]: I agree.

499
00:48:27,773 --> 00:48:34,636
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I certainly am very sympathetic to not wanting to deliver a gigantic packet for review all in one meeting.

500
00:48:34,736 --> 00:48:44,081
[SPEAKER_12]: At the same time, I think, also thinking about keeping this coherent for residents that are following along in this process, I like the idea of

501
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:49,580
[SPEAKER_12]: getting through the definitions, even if it takes a couple of meetings, and then updating the definitions.

502
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:57,282
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it'd be an overreach to say in one fell swoop, but doing that in one meeting as opposed to two, along with the use, the GIS, the site plan review.

503
00:48:57,702 --> 00:49:04,003
[SPEAKER_12]: And that keeps us with our goal of getting those pieces dispensed with prior to the end of the fiscal year.

504
00:49:04,424 --> 00:49:09,425
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think it would be a great start to hit that, to do that as one package.

505
00:49:10,165 --> 00:49:14,666
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Callahan, I think I saw your hand go up.

506
00:49:15,595 --> 00:49:32,491
[SPEAKER_12]: In that case, I would recommend that maybe we rest on the, for now, dwelling multifamily definition, since we're going to, I think, it'd be advantageous to get some proposals back from Innes Associates in two weeks based on this discussion.

507
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:40,059
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we should come back to this at the end of the meeting, but for now, I would recommend that we put a pin in this, work our way through some of these other definitions,

508
00:49:41,254 --> 00:49:54,145
[SPEAKER_12]: enjoy the ones that are a little bit simpler and then maybe come back at the end of the meeting to this and any other definitions that are a little bit stickier and figure out exactly what we want to request of the consultant in terms of our next steps for reviewing this in two weeks.

509
00:49:55,966 --> 00:49:56,386
[SPEAKER_12]: How's that sound?

510
00:49:58,728 --> 00:49:58,948
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

511
00:49:59,649 --> 00:50:00,770
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's go to doggie daycare.

512
00:50:05,939 --> 00:50:06,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

513
00:50:06,339 --> 00:50:07,000
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry before.

514
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,101
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry to cut you off.

515
00:50:08,541 --> 00:50:11,043
[SPEAKER_12]: Attorney Silverstein, is your hand up for before or do you have a comment?

516
00:50:15,306 --> 00:50:16,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry, that was just from before.

517
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:17,788
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll take it then.

518
00:50:17,808 --> 00:50:20,371
[SPEAKER_06]: Please go ahead.

519
00:50:21,011 --> 00:50:21,191
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

520
00:50:22,172 --> 00:50:23,413
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, that was just from before.

521
00:50:25,495 --> 00:50:25,915
[SPEAKER_06]: Great, thank you.

522
00:50:27,143 --> 00:50:33,105
[SPEAKER_00]: The dog care will be a facility providing care for dogs on a daily basis without overnight accommodation.

523
00:50:33,445 --> 00:50:38,867
[SPEAKER_00]: The facility may include indoor and outdoor areas for the dogs where they will be under supervision.

524
00:50:39,287 --> 00:50:42,948
[SPEAKER_00]: For clarity, this definition does not include animal boarding facilities.

525
00:50:45,989 --> 00:50:46,630
[SPEAKER_12]: Any questions?

526
00:50:46,650 --> 00:50:47,050
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

527
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:52,432
[SPEAKER_12]: Any additional context before we go to comments from councillors?

528
00:50:55,833 --> 00:50:56,533
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Callahan.

529
00:50:58,786 --> 00:51:00,427
[SPEAKER_10]: Just an amusing anecdote.

530
00:51:01,328 --> 00:51:09,673
[SPEAKER_10]: As I was canvassing, I passed by a van, and inside that van, they were washing dogs.

531
00:51:10,773 --> 00:51:13,715
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like mobile doggie daycare.

532
00:51:13,795 --> 00:51:14,395
[SPEAKER_10]: It's so weird.

533
00:51:15,336 --> 00:51:16,657
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not the definition.

534
00:51:16,677 --> 00:51:18,418
[SPEAKER_12]: Never mind.

535
00:51:18,498 --> 00:51:20,619
[SPEAKER_12]: But we could change that tonight.

536
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:21,800
[SPEAKER_12]: President Bears, go ahead.

537
00:51:23,922 --> 00:51:28,563
[SPEAKER_05]: We have an interesting choice as to be fun or serious with this definition.

538
00:51:29,964 --> 00:51:30,804
[SPEAKER_05]: Doggy or dog.

539
00:51:35,005 --> 00:51:36,386
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really have a position.

540
00:51:38,386 --> 00:51:39,867
[SPEAKER_12]: I certainly don't have a position.

541
00:51:40,787 --> 00:51:42,287
[SPEAKER_07]: Canine daycare perhaps.

542
00:51:44,368 --> 00:51:45,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Zoning is boring.

543
00:51:45,928 --> 00:51:48,129
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it if we can laugh sometimes.

544
00:51:50,425 --> 00:51:55,027
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say, I believe that the colloquial is doggie daycare and not dog daycare.

545
00:51:55,627 --> 00:52:00,889
[SPEAKER_10]: I think people say doggie daycare, so I would leave it as doggie because that's what people say.

546
00:52:01,370 --> 00:52:02,950
[SPEAKER_07]: Canine care facility.

547
00:52:03,631 --> 00:52:04,611
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely not, Zito.

548
00:52:06,232 --> 00:52:07,512
[SPEAKER_13]: We can go with the doggie then.

549
00:52:10,934 --> 00:52:11,254
Okay.

550
00:52:13,375 --> 00:52:18,017
[SPEAKER_12]: And I understand that this is one of those terms that did not have a definition, so we're imposing one for the first time.

551
00:52:18,457 --> 00:52:18,617
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

552
00:52:19,172 --> 00:52:20,293
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, thank you.

553
00:52:21,273 --> 00:52:23,075
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have any questions on this one.

554
00:52:24,596 --> 00:52:26,917
[SPEAKER_12]: Any further questions from fellow councilors?

555
00:52:28,919 --> 00:52:36,124
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, and this will remain dog daycare unless there is a motion to change it to doggy daycare, because dog daycare is what is in the suggestion.

556
00:52:39,006 --> 00:52:40,667
[SPEAKER_12]: So I leave it to you, my colleagues.

557
00:52:41,267 --> 00:52:42,308
[SPEAKER_12]: Moving on, quickly.

558
00:52:43,048 --> 00:52:44,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to change it to doggy daycare.

559
00:52:47,550 --> 00:52:48,611
[SPEAKER_00]: We changed to doggie.

560
00:52:49,012 --> 00:52:50,073
[SPEAKER_00]: That's perfectly fine.

561
00:52:50,253 --> 00:52:52,355
[SPEAKER_12]: Or I guess I'm sorry, that doesn't need to be a motion.

562
00:52:54,897 --> 00:52:56,258
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't believe that has to be a motion.

563
00:52:56,318 --> 00:52:56,919
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, great.

564
00:52:57,039 --> 00:53:01,863
[SPEAKER_13]: I rescind my motion.

565
00:53:15,694 --> 00:53:15,974
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

566
00:53:16,014 --> 00:53:17,395
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's move along to number three.

567
00:53:17,415 --> 00:53:17,695
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

568
00:53:18,535 --> 00:53:29,999
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the next definitions that are still under review because it's too broad and we really want to find a more specific for all of this.

569
00:53:30,019 --> 00:53:40,844
[SPEAKER_00]: So this we will come back with the eating establishment, cafe, coffee shop, drive-in, eating places becomes eating place drive-through.

570
00:53:41,764 --> 00:53:44,405
[SPEAKER_00]: This we will come back with more information.

571
00:53:46,144 --> 00:53:48,686
[SPEAKER_05]: The second... If I could just jump in on that really quickly.

572
00:53:49,267 --> 00:53:56,694
[SPEAKER_05]: In the definitions, it is eating place drive-thru already, so that may have just been... Is it still drive-in eating place in the use table?

573
00:54:02,409 --> 00:54:08,971
[SPEAKER_01]: So in site plan review, it's listed as, right, no, but which term is used?

574
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:14,452
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the term is inconsistent in that in the table of uses.

575
00:54:14,472 --> 00:54:15,472
[SPEAKER_05]: I just found it.

576
00:54:15,512 --> 00:54:19,573
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a eating place without drive-thru, eating place with drive-thru in the use table.

577
00:54:20,473 --> 00:54:26,775
[SPEAKER_05]: It is eating place and then eating place drive-thru in the definitions.

578
00:54:28,725 --> 00:54:31,146
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll also need to change it in site plan review.

579
00:54:31,446 --> 00:54:39,051
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the ones that are required for site plan review besides this, like if it's too big, it needs to have a site plan review.

580
00:54:39,492 --> 00:54:46,816
[SPEAKER_01]: If this says drive in eating places, and I think that may have in fact referred to when we had drive in theaters here.

581
00:54:48,798 --> 00:54:55,442
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but if we want drive through eating places to have site plan review, we'll need to change that section as well.

582
00:54:58,007 --> 00:55:00,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's how we've been applying it.

583
00:55:01,489 --> 00:55:01,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.

584
00:55:01,930 --> 00:55:05,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and it definitely makes sense to add a cafe, coffee shop definition.

585
00:55:06,132 --> 00:55:06,693
[SPEAKER_13]: 11.7.2, if you need it.

586
00:55:07,353 --> 00:55:09,755
[SPEAKER_05]: If you haven't done the research on it yet, totally understand.

587
00:55:09,875 --> 00:55:14,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there a terminology that is consistent, like eating place, eating establishment?

588
00:55:14,398 --> 00:55:19,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you mean among other community, other zoning, not ours?

589
00:55:19,821 --> 00:55:20,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Or in the state law.

590
00:55:22,423 --> 00:55:24,004
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll look into it.

591
00:55:24,084 --> 00:55:25,545
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it does.

592
00:55:25,765 --> 00:55:27,086
[SPEAKER_05]: They all seem a little convoluted.

593
00:55:28,874 --> 00:55:31,855
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we will search it and come back with that.

594
00:55:32,735 --> 00:55:32,995
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

595
00:55:33,015 --> 00:55:33,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

596
00:55:36,036 --> 00:55:42,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Another one that is, and this is a bit complex, is household.

597
00:55:43,638 --> 00:55:48,099
[SPEAKER_00]: And then another thing is replace family with household, but the definition of household itself.

598
00:55:50,199 --> 00:55:56,001
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this one, for example, we want to bring different definitions because each of them have

599
00:55:58,547 --> 00:56:26,054
[SPEAKER_00]: add different color to the definition and we want you to tell us also and comment what is exactly that you want by this definition because it can be that has the housekeeping unit, it can be multi-tenant, so we want to bring forward different definitions so you can tell us better what is exactly that you're looking in this definition.

600
00:56:26,994 --> 00:56:28,855
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a bit too complex.

601
00:56:29,215 --> 00:56:30,355
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's worth discussing.

602
00:56:30,395 --> 00:56:40,500
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we had a lot of discussions about this when we did the recodification, and I believe where we landed on that, most of those discussions, I think Councilor Scarpelli and I were the only ones here for.

603
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:50,584
[SPEAKER_05]: The final vote was that the consanguinity blood relation stuff is totally out the window.

604
00:56:50,604 --> 00:56:51,524
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't do that.

605
00:56:51,564 --> 00:56:52,205
[SPEAKER_05]: That's illegal.

606
00:56:54,827 --> 00:57:05,134
[SPEAKER_05]: And we wanted to define household, which I think the definition in here does meet the intent, which is everybody who lives in a single housing unit.

607
00:57:05,694 --> 00:57:06,535
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a household.

608
00:57:07,535 --> 00:57:14,240
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess what I'm hearing you say is, A, if we want to rehash that whole argument, we had like three meetings on that argument.

609
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:21,885
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it might be worth looking at the meeting reports from those meetings to see why we landed where we landed and what we voted on for specific motions.

610
00:57:24,164 --> 00:57:32,859
[SPEAKER_05]: But is what you're saying that we need a definition of both because there's elements of state law?

611
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:37,047
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there something outside of our zoning that would require us to have a separate definition for each of those terms?

612
00:57:39,231 --> 00:57:40,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, not as specifically.

613
00:57:40,571 --> 00:57:51,375
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want, it's, it's a bit of depending, for example, in Toronto, they are going to pass, and I'm not saying that this is Toronto, but it's, they are trying to do something with affordability housing.

614
00:57:51,475 --> 00:58:02,498
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is to put in a definition of multi-tenant that is different from household because that are multi incomes and each one of them, uh, it's like a,

615
00:58:03,351 --> 00:58:13,029
[SPEAKER_00]: student housing or something like that, if it's something that is interesting for our zoning or if it's not and we are only looking for household, for example.

616
00:58:15,731 --> 00:58:24,340
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that one of the things that we have been hearing is, well, Medford got rid of the rule of how many people are allowed to live together in a unit.

617
00:58:24,440 --> 00:58:28,063
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we can rent all these bedrooms out to separate people.

618
00:58:28,704 --> 00:58:33,869
[SPEAKER_01]: And it doesn't matter because we could put seven unrelated adults in this building.

619
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:39,315
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what we were trying to get at is we are not trying to define

620
00:58:39,875 --> 00:59:04,965
[SPEAKER_01]: what a household is like if you want to um and there are some places that define it as um a housekeeping unit meaning do you cook together do you share food bills do you like share bills and do you consider yourselves together a household versus you are unrelated strangers who do not even know each other because your landlord has rented out each of the bedrooms separately to each of you

621
00:59:05,965 --> 00:59:09,746
[SPEAKER_01]: and how that sort of interplays in the community.

622
00:59:10,906 --> 00:59:16,187
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that there are people who have been building houses particularly designed to do that.

623
00:59:17,167 --> 00:59:20,048
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's an interesting question.

624
00:59:20,208 --> 00:59:21,588
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like a boarding house.

625
00:59:23,449 --> 00:59:25,429
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a definition of a boarding house.

626
00:59:25,909 --> 00:59:32,931
[SPEAKER_01]: If somebody wants to build a house with six bedrooms, each with their own bathroom, with a central kitchen,

627
00:59:34,011 --> 00:59:41,744
[SPEAKER_01]: In 10, 30 years ago, that was a boarding house, and it was allowed under certain conditions and had different regulations on it.

628
00:59:44,494 --> 00:59:53,038
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's sort of what we want to be, as opposed to, we're a group of six people who have decided that we want to live together communally.

629
00:59:53,459 --> 00:59:56,720
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that, I feel like the city council's like, well, why should we say no to that?

630
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:58,061
[SPEAKER_01]: That's their right to do that.

631
00:59:58,121 --> 00:59:59,382
[SPEAKER_01]: That's perfectly fine.

632
01:00:01,182 --> 01:00:03,684
[SPEAKER_01]: They also would never consider that a boarding house, right?

633
01:00:03,764 --> 01:00:05,965
[SPEAKER_01]: That's people setting up housekeeping together.

634
01:00:07,847 --> 01:00:08,867
[SPEAKER_01]: And do we care?

635
01:00:10,128 --> 01:00:11,228
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it is, we are.

636
01:00:11,328 --> 01:00:15,789
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it might actually be an interesting question to raise to the public.

637
01:00:17,390 --> 01:00:18,550
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the houses have been built.

638
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:19,850
[SPEAKER_01]: People are living there.

639
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:24,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than you don't like how many cars they have, please don't tell me that that's your objection.

640
01:00:25,012 --> 01:00:25,752
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care.

641
01:00:26,232 --> 01:00:27,512
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other objections, right?

642
01:00:27,572 --> 01:00:36,675
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it actually a problem in the community because there are eight people living there rather than a family with a couple of kids?

643
01:00:37,645 --> 01:00:41,307
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how is that, why does, how does that impact the neighbors?

644
01:00:42,047 --> 01:00:42,348
[SPEAKER_01]: You know?

645
01:00:45,189 --> 01:00:50,532
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess, let's just guess, I guess, you know, what's the question we're trying to solve for?

646
01:00:54,354 --> 01:00:57,856
[SPEAKER_05]: And do we do that by defining the people or the structure?

647
01:00:58,843 --> 01:00:59,104
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

648
01:00:59,264 --> 01:01:02,130
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the better way to to go after that?

649
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:06,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think when we start, I think it's just really hard to enforce housekeeping unit.

650
01:01:07,701 --> 01:01:08,322
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know how.

651
01:01:10,114 --> 01:01:14,817
[SPEAKER_05]: What if the landlord says, hey, everybody, tell them all you want to live together, which they will do.

652
01:01:15,617 --> 01:01:25,522
[SPEAKER_05]: If I'm a landlord who built a structure and now we've regulated that structure to say you can't do what it was designed for, then there's going to be an incentive for them to lie.

653
01:01:25,542 --> 01:01:36,648
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it also strikes me, and I apologize for cutting you off, but on the same thread, I think one way to look into this is like, when is the question coming up?

654
01:01:36,908 --> 01:01:39,650
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know what I often hear is people having a legitimate concern about,

655
01:01:41,266 --> 01:01:43,267
[SPEAKER_12]: safety when it comes to number of people in a house.

656
01:01:43,327 --> 01:01:49,870
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, there were those very high profile tragedies like maybe a decade ago at this point about overcrowded housing in student areas.

657
01:01:49,950 --> 01:02:04,018
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, we don't want to, I don't think that these rules are widely abused, but we don't want to create loopholes where people feel there is an invitation to as many people as want can live in this house and people are sleeping in attics.

658
01:02:04,518 --> 01:02:08,320
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, that's not the intent.

659
01:02:09,002 --> 01:02:14,544
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think like maybe one way of asking this question, it's like, where is this coming up in City Hall?

660
01:02:14,805 --> 01:02:17,426
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, when is this question coming to us?

661
01:02:21,888 --> 01:02:33,653
[SPEAKER_12]: And from there, is it the number of occupants that we ought to try to define and then regulate because that regulation is being negotiated or is it the size of the building?

662
01:02:35,270 --> 01:02:41,814
[SPEAKER_05]: or even the, I mean, I don't know, if we can, by zoning, regulate what you were talking about, like the separate bathrooms per bedroom.

663
01:02:43,095 --> 01:02:43,555
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

664
01:02:44,516 --> 01:02:46,717
[SPEAKER_05]: I have more questions, but I just, if Councilor Cohen's had any.

665
01:02:46,917 --> 01:02:58,204
[SPEAKER_10]: I was just gonna say, for what you're talking about, which is housekeeping, in the non-housekeeping example, do they each pay the landlord individually rent?

666
01:02:58,284 --> 01:03:02,667
[SPEAKER_10]: Because that's another way to sort of define it, is to say,

667
01:03:03,288 --> 01:03:13,852
[SPEAKER_10]: Are these people all paying rent as a unit, or is the landlord requiring, like, are these people who don't cooperate, and therefore they each pay separate rent to the landlord?

668
01:03:14,032 --> 01:03:17,313
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a little bit more easy to define than housekeeping.

669
01:03:17,333 --> 01:03:20,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and that one's easy to prove.

670
01:03:21,952 --> 01:03:41,423
[SPEAKER_01]: My it's coming up that people are expressing concerns before it happens Um, and I will actually so the overcrowdedness when we had those meetings back Um a couple years ago and talked about remote changing this definition One of the things we said very definitively is those are health department issues, right?

671
01:03:41,844 --> 01:03:43,265
[SPEAKER_01]: If a place is overcrowded

672
01:03:44,165 --> 01:03:45,646
[SPEAKER_01]: And and it's not safe.

673
01:03:46,066 --> 01:03:47,607
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a health department issue.

674
01:03:47,667 --> 01:03:54,790
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not a matter of zoning And the health department would handle it right now.

675
01:03:54,970 --> 01:03:59,632
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more likely happening because it's actually, you know, we have a

676
01:03:59,912 --> 01:04:10,915
[SPEAKER_01]: a family that lives here and then a family that they know or maybe they're related to comes from another country and has nowhere to live, the immigrant families, and they stay together.

677
01:04:11,375 --> 01:04:14,576
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that building is really overcrowded with people.

678
01:04:15,076 --> 01:04:18,877
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not actually, like that's a health department issue.

679
01:04:19,137 --> 01:04:21,898
[SPEAKER_01]: That is something that the health department is seeing in Medford.

680
01:04:21,938 --> 01:04:26,719
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a very difficult issue because if you evict them, they have nowhere to go.

681
01:04:27,299 --> 01:04:29,380
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it safer for them to be living there?

682
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:33,082
[SPEAKER_01]: And in those cases, they are families, right?

683
01:04:33,182 --> 01:04:35,483
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's very rare that they're like strangers.

684
01:04:35,523 --> 01:04:37,984
[SPEAKER_01]: It's completely not the landlord doing it.

685
01:04:38,445 --> 01:04:42,747
[SPEAKER_01]: I think from a zoning perspective, we were more concerned with.

686
01:04:43,527 --> 01:04:45,869
[SPEAKER_01]: The landlord is doing it to the tenants.

687
01:04:46,529 --> 01:04:54,356
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like, in my mind, a place for the city should be protecting is the is the landlord doing this to the tenants.

688
01:04:54,996 --> 01:05:03,102
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there is there somebody who's getting rich off of the fact that we changed our zoning to be accommodating and to be under, like,

689
01:05:03,903 --> 01:05:08,545
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess, accommodating two different living styles, which we're very open to.

690
01:05:09,705 --> 01:05:16,587
[SPEAKER_01]: And now instead of that, the unintended consequence is that a landlord is making a whole heck of a lot of money.

691
01:05:17,307 --> 01:05:22,469
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people who are living there are actually not happy with the situation.

692
01:05:24,289 --> 01:05:25,310
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a different

693
01:05:26,403 --> 01:05:36,893
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will say that there was a concern about a particular building in Medford, a single family, and the thought was that it was being rented like Airbnb, the different bedrooms.

694
01:05:37,374 --> 01:05:46,363
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the things the building inspector went, he asked, he talked to the person who lived there who said that they were the owner, their parents owned the property, which was sufficient.

695
01:05:46,923 --> 01:05:48,644
[SPEAKER_01]: but asked if he could look around.

696
01:05:49,325 --> 01:05:55,569
[SPEAKER_01]: And when he looked around, he said to me, what I looked for, was it obvious that there were individual locks on the bedroom doors?

697
01:05:56,089 --> 01:06:00,072
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big sign that the people in that those units don't trust each other.

698
01:06:00,432 --> 01:06:03,434
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, and there were no signs of like locked bedroom doors.

699
01:06:03,474 --> 01:06:04,795
[SPEAKER_01]: The bedroom doors were open.

700
01:06:05,095 --> 01:06:07,917
[SPEAKER_01]: There were no locks on the doors that could have been locked.

701
01:06:08,217 --> 01:06:09,218
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, that's why I didn't.

702
01:06:09,378 --> 01:06:11,880
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, when the guy said to me, these are my roommates.

703
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,041
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, that's that's legit.

704
01:06:14,081 --> 01:06:14,842
[SPEAKER_01]: We allow that.

705
01:06:15,262 --> 01:06:16,463
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have something you wanted to add?

706
01:06:17,083 --> 01:06:23,906
[SPEAKER_01]: to it, Danielle?

707
01:06:25,187 --> 01:06:30,149
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's a really helpful illustration of some of what we're talking around here.

708
01:06:31,750 --> 01:06:39,434
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on my mind after that kind of example, and I'm trying to think of how to phrase this, because I think it's

709
01:06:40,725 --> 01:06:43,006
[SPEAKER_12]: It's widely known, I care a lot about tenant protections.

710
01:06:43,807 --> 01:07:00,497
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm wondering if there's some parallel between overcrowding not being what we're solving for in zoning and that type, obviously we're trying not to create zoning definitions that invite in bad behavior or things to take advantage of.

711
01:07:00,918 --> 01:07:06,281
[SPEAKER_12]: But in the same way, I don't want to overcorrect for problems that are also

712
01:07:07,884 --> 01:07:21,377
[SPEAKER_12]: shouldn't be adjudicated through zoning, but should be adjudicated through a supportive service that City Hall offers, whether it's Board of Health or the Housing Planner or the multilingual support line.

713
01:07:21,497 --> 01:07:22,018
[SPEAKER_12]: Do you know what I mean?

714
01:07:23,626 --> 01:07:37,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there is a website called Split Spot that facilitates landlords renting just rooms in a single family house, for example.

715
01:07:37,591 --> 01:07:39,451
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know there's a market out there.

716
01:07:40,031 --> 01:07:46,934
[SPEAKER_01]: Danielle just told me that she looked up that there are a couple of Medford single family houses listed on there.

717
01:07:47,334 --> 01:07:50,715
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are trying to separately rent out the bedrooms on that.

718
01:07:51,836 --> 01:07:56,120
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the question is, how do we, how much do we care?

719
01:07:56,220 --> 01:08:06,751
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is the, you know, if somebody is chosen to use this website and chooses to live there, should we tell them that they can't?

720
01:08:07,612 --> 01:08:09,874
[SPEAKER_01]: On the other hand, how does that impact our community?

721
01:08:12,145 --> 01:08:12,685
[SPEAKER_10]: Councilor Callahan.

722
01:08:12,946 --> 01:08:29,797
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say this issue is very important to me as someone who has lived in intentional communities for almost my entire life and had difficulty being able to live with other people, being afraid that the landlord will discover that in a four bedroom house, the four of us are unrelated and therefore we're going to be kicked out.

723
01:08:30,698 --> 01:08:33,039
[SPEAKER_10]: I think there's a lot of fear among tenants.

724
01:08:34,120 --> 01:08:38,403
[SPEAKER_10]: And yet I also think that the idea of being forced to live with other people that I don't know

725
01:08:38,963 --> 01:08:40,323
[SPEAKER_10]: is horrible.

726
01:08:40,684 --> 01:08:46,425
[SPEAKER_10]: So to me, what you're surfacing here is exactly has been a lot of my life experience.

727
01:08:46,465 --> 01:08:49,246
[SPEAKER_10]: And so to me, this is an extremely important issue.

728
01:08:50,326 --> 01:09:03,750
[SPEAKER_10]: And I really like the way that you're thinking about the things that matter are not the number of people, which is a health department issue, but the things that matter are, do the tenants want to live this way?

729
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:06,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Or is the landlord forcing them to live this way?

730
01:09:06,990 --> 01:09:09,492
[SPEAKER_10]: So I very much appreciate this difference.

731
01:09:09,552 --> 01:09:20,499
[SPEAKER_10]: But whether we define it using housekeeping or define it using separate rents or define it, you know, the way that we determine it, I think can be massaged.

732
01:09:21,059 --> 01:09:23,881
[SPEAKER_10]: But to me, those are the two important.

733
01:09:25,302 --> 01:09:29,464
[SPEAKER_10]: That is the important difference between the two is like, is this something that tenants are choosing?

734
01:09:29,605 --> 01:09:31,746
[SPEAKER_10]: And yes, they are fine having, you know,

735
01:09:32,276 --> 01:09:35,997
[SPEAKER_10]: one extra person, or if somebody there has a young child, they're fine with it?

736
01:09:36,518 --> 01:09:39,499
[SPEAKER_10]: Or are these people who are really being forced to live together by the landlord?

737
01:09:39,539 --> 01:09:41,580
[SPEAKER_10]: So I would want to be able to zone.

738
01:09:41,620 --> 01:09:43,260
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't mean that we're saying it can't happen.

739
01:09:43,460 --> 01:09:48,562
[SPEAKER_10]: It just means we can zone them and have an awareness of what's happening.

740
01:09:54,344 --> 01:09:57,866
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we had to actually put this forward as one that's under review.

741
01:09:57,886 --> 01:10:00,427
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, Paula, this is useful.

742
01:10:01,482 --> 01:10:03,243
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's very useful.

743
01:10:03,303 --> 01:10:07,665
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the things that I also wanted to have more clarified.

744
01:10:08,305 --> 01:10:10,226
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great discussion.

745
01:10:10,766 --> 01:10:13,947
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can continue to work on it.

746
01:10:15,148 --> 01:10:15,408
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

747
01:10:16,428 --> 01:10:26,196
[SPEAKER_01]: And I will just add that if there's anybody of the Council or listening who has seen definitions that they like and would like us to consider, feel free to send them along.

748
01:10:26,816 --> 01:10:36,744
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the Innes Associates will do research on this and come up with language, but if you have seen something that you like, please don't hesitate to tell us that.

749
01:10:36,764 --> 01:10:40,447
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Councilor Leming.

750
01:10:42,295 --> 01:10:48,159
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't wanna have you all repeat what you just said, but just kind of a basic question about this.

751
01:10:48,179 --> 01:10:58,966
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was one of you might've told me about that landlord in Somerville who just kind of kept on renting, like stuffing tenants into the same place and then charging them a thousand a month for it.

752
01:10:59,026 --> 01:11:00,727
[SPEAKER_07]: And that just kept adding up.

753
01:11:01,628 --> 01:11:10,914
[SPEAKER_07]: So the two questions are, how often do you see things like that happening?

754
01:11:13,016 --> 01:11:23,755
[SPEAKER_07]: just in your positions and what can this definition do practically to help you prevent that from happening in the future?

755
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:33,616
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gotten a couple of people who've reached out to us.

756
01:11:33,836 --> 01:11:39,779
[SPEAKER_01]: The ones that I've heard from were concerned because they knew what was being built in their neighborhood.

757
01:11:40,299 --> 01:11:43,661
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were not calling to say, here are the problems we've seen.

758
01:11:44,241 --> 01:11:45,181
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard it a few times.

759
01:11:45,262 --> 01:11:48,603
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Danielle was just telling me that she's heard from a few people.

760
01:11:48,623 --> 01:11:53,546
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's more that there's a fear.

761
01:11:54,631 --> 01:12:22,116
[SPEAKER_01]: then and i'm not clear that our office is necessarily the one people would be coming to right would they go to the building department health department like would they say i don't have a place i can even go to come i don't know um just i think i think we should take this question outside of the process of even two weeks from now i think this is another one where it may behoove us to say

762
01:12:22,881 --> 01:12:24,717
[SPEAKER_05]: We need to look at short-term rental.

763
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:42,823
[SPEAKER_05]: lodging house definition, all of the, dormitory definition, all of the definitions and uses where we're talking about how different groups of people are in using different housing units and try to align that to a new structure.

764
01:12:42,843 --> 01:12:45,783
[SPEAKER_05]: Because again, we didn't do that in the recodification, right?

765
01:12:45,803 --> 01:12:51,964
[SPEAKER_05]: The lodging house definition and the lodger definition is still, I think you could apply those to these situations, right?

766
01:12:52,024 --> 01:12:54,825
[SPEAKER_05]: You could, I mean, if the building department wanted to, I could see them,

767
01:12:56,232 --> 01:13:04,560
[SPEAKER_05]: saying if there's seven locked bedrooms and, you know, I can see them applying that definition to it.

768
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:05,921
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know that that's fair either.

769
01:13:06,522 --> 01:13:12,127
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we should take this whole, I think right now, the definition of household fits what we're saying, right?

770
01:13:12,167 --> 01:13:17,392
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it fits the intent of the council's vote on the recodification, which was that a household is the people who live in a unit.

771
01:13:18,226 --> 01:13:31,332
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if we need to redefine what a unit is to say that if there's a single family structure with seven locked bedrooms, that's seven units and not one unit, or it's seven micro units or a multi-tenant arrangement or something like that, I think that makes sense.

772
01:13:32,112 --> 01:13:39,576
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think, again, it's like you pull that thread and then there's like four other things that we would need to adjust and address to fix that too.

773
01:13:39,656 --> 01:13:46,539
[SPEAKER_05]: So that to me seems like it's almost a bucket of questions and something that we should look at like holistically together.

774
01:13:48,125 --> 01:13:50,027
[SPEAKER_05]: as we update the whole ordinance.

775
01:13:51,048 --> 01:13:58,515
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just also want to throw in, it could be worth saying that if you're doing this sort of arrangement, you can't have parking permits or something, right?

776
01:13:58,895 --> 01:13:59,195
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

777
01:13:59,476 --> 01:14:06,182
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something that we're considering and I know Somerville has considered it when that has been a concern for on-street parking.

778
01:14:08,544 --> 01:14:09,785
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that approach could make sense.

779
01:14:09,825 --> 01:14:14,189
[SPEAKER_12]: I was thinking along similar lines that it strikes me that some of the concerns that were

780
01:14:14,625 --> 01:14:15,325
[SPEAKER_12]: talking about here.

781
01:14:15,345 --> 01:14:33,354
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think just to lay the foundation first, I think it's, I feel pretty comfortable with the current definition as is for the moment while we're contemplating this bigger question, because I think that does still reflect the intent of the council and city staff in allowing people to define for themselves what their household is.

782
01:14:33,774 --> 01:14:41,798
[SPEAKER_12]: And I do have some, I will admit I have some skepticism about our ability to frame zoning language in a way that helps us get at the enforcement piece of when that is taken advantage of.

783
01:14:42,318 --> 01:14:43,319
[SPEAKER_12]: I do think it gets into that,

784
01:14:45,519 --> 01:15:04,467
[SPEAKER_12]: It gets into that issue that we have been talking about mainly with the short-term rentals, where this is more an enforcement issue and building up our capacity to run down those complaints when property owners are doing things with their property that they're not allowed to do, and making sure that tenants or boarders are okay and get the support that they need in those cases where that is happening.

785
01:15:06,088 --> 01:15:12,371
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I think that in terms of the definition, it makes sense to consider this alongside other more similar

786
01:15:13,157 --> 01:15:36,087
[SPEAKER_12]: definitions like the boarding house, the dormitory, and I think the rest of it might get into a conversation that's slightly outside of the scope of zoning, or at least blurs outside of the scope of zoning, such as with, of course, the complaints about, the fears about overcrowding of parking on residential streets, and when homes are becoming busier.

787
01:15:37,108 --> 01:15:42,730
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's familiar to all of us, and for example, one way the city has been thinking about addressing that is through

788
01:15:43,109 --> 01:15:44,389
[SPEAKER_12]: mechanisms like zoned parking.

789
01:15:45,090 --> 01:15:52,632
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think there's some latitude that we have in zoning and there's others that we have through other mechanisms that kind of go alongside it.

790
01:15:52,652 --> 01:16:03,055
[SPEAKER_05]: If I may, Vice President Collins, I think what we may have identified here, like the nexus for why this came on, is that by changing the definition, we've unearthed a new use.

791
01:16:04,249 --> 01:16:07,051
[SPEAKER_05]: rather than that, that we need to adjust the definition of household.

792
01:16:07,411 --> 01:16:09,452
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that might be like how I would think about it.

793
01:16:09,552 --> 01:16:23,821
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there's a use that doesn't quite fit dormitory lodging house, but also that our definition of household being anyone who wants to live together as long as it's safe and appropriate for the health code can live in a unit together.

794
01:16:25,612 --> 01:16:28,214
[SPEAKER_05]: That is, I don't think that principle is something we want to change.

795
01:16:28,254 --> 01:16:41,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think by changing it, we may have allowed an undefined use that we had never seen before, or a variant of the lodging house use that is kind of unexpected and different.

796
01:16:46,064 --> 01:16:46,264
[SPEAKER_12]: Right.

797
01:16:49,166 --> 01:16:54,569
[SPEAKER_12]: Also worth noting that occasionally individual rooms are rented out, and that's wanted and desired and unproblematic.

798
01:16:55,580 --> 01:17:01,984
[SPEAKER_12]: older brother was a Medford resident for a long time in a situation like that, so just to state that for the record as well.

799
01:17:02,764 --> 01:17:11,069
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it makes sense to consider, you know, what's the language that captured, I think that this language captures our current intent comfortably.

800
01:17:11,089 --> 01:17:18,774
[SPEAKER_12]: And maybe there's a new definition to add to the roster to capture this one.

801
01:17:21,075 --> 01:17:23,597
[SPEAKER_12]: Any additional comments on

802
01:17:24,758 --> 01:17:25,298
[SPEAKER_12]: household.

803
01:17:25,318 --> 01:17:28,520
[SPEAKER_12]: This has been a fruitful conversation, I think.

804
01:17:32,962 --> 01:17:33,142
[SPEAKER_12]: No?

805
01:17:34,363 --> 01:17:38,785
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll suggest we move on unless there's any additional comments from Councilors on household.

806
01:17:38,805 --> 01:17:43,608
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.

807
01:17:44,068 --> 01:17:45,909
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

808
01:17:45,929 --> 01:17:48,990
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, thank you for all the feedback.

809
01:17:49,071 --> 01:17:49,871
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super useful.

810
01:17:50,890 --> 01:17:57,772
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's an underview because it can touch so many things.

811
01:17:58,032 --> 01:18:06,975
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a transversal topic that we need to do a lot more research than just define and go with it.

812
01:18:07,155 --> 01:18:09,416
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for all your comments.

813
01:18:11,936 --> 01:18:16,077
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one to be defined was institutional use.

814
01:18:16,157 --> 01:18:34,305
[SPEAKER_00]: The suggested definition on institutional use is the use of land or structures for the non-profit, charitable, benevolent, spiritual, instructional, or custodial activities of government, education, religious, healthcare, social service, fraternal, sorority, or similar organizations.

815
01:18:46,218 --> 01:18:48,338
[SPEAKER_12]: I think this is to ask an obvious question.

816
01:18:48,358 --> 01:18:53,379
[SPEAKER_12]: So this is specifically for incorporated nonprofits use of land and lots.

817
01:18:57,100 --> 01:18:59,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Any comments or questions by Councilors?

818
01:19:04,681 --> 01:19:10,782
[SPEAKER_12]: And again, this was an existing use that simply did not have a definition previously.

819
01:19:14,283 --> 01:19:14,663
Correct.

820
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:14,843
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

821
01:19:17,122 --> 01:19:22,245
[SPEAKER_12]: All right, not seeing any comments from fellow councillors, we can move on.

822
01:19:24,807 --> 01:19:26,928
[SPEAKER_00]: Another definition, mixed use.

823
01:19:27,208 --> 01:19:37,775
[SPEAKER_00]: Mixed use development, development containing a mix of residential uses and non-residential uses, including without limitation, commercial, institutional, industrial or other uses.

824
01:19:45,825 --> 01:19:46,986
[SPEAKER_12]: for me, this one looks good.

825
01:19:47,006 --> 01:19:57,033
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that this follows with our principle of letting definitions be definitions and not imposing additional standards that might get us into the weeds where it's not helpful.

826
01:19:58,654 --> 01:19:59,655
[SPEAKER_11]: Any additional comments?

827
01:19:59,675 --> 01:20:01,577
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think you can't do better than Chapter 48.

828
01:20:03,638 --> 01:20:04,038
[SPEAKER_04]: We're good.

829
01:20:04,058 --> 01:20:06,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.

830
01:20:06,700 --> 01:20:07,001
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

831
01:20:07,201 --> 01:20:08,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they can do better, but we can't.

832
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:16,562
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, these are also going to have some discussion.

833
01:20:18,882 --> 01:20:24,744
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a term to be clarified, manufacturer home, mobile home and tiny home.

834
01:20:25,144 --> 01:20:28,825
[SPEAKER_00]: And your current definition, there's only the definition for mobile home.

835
01:20:30,706 --> 01:20:40,809
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a dwelling unit built on a chassis and containing complete electrical, plumbing and sanitary facilities and designed to be installed on a temporary or permanent foundation for living quarters.

836
01:20:41,951 --> 01:20:42,054
[SPEAKER_00]: um

837
01:20:44,221 --> 01:20:55,009
[SPEAKER_00]: we are suggesting a definition, and it's not a new one, it's not to chain mobile home, but to add manufactured home.

838
01:20:55,029 --> 01:21:08,998
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a structure portable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to required utilities.

839
01:21:09,839 --> 01:21:13,442
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have some, a part of it that is underlined

840
01:21:14,998 --> 01:21:25,901
[SPEAKER_00]: which it is to something that we could bring to this as an addition, or if you see that it's not interesting, we can take it out.

841
01:21:27,681 --> 01:21:34,803
[SPEAKER_00]: But as in oak bluffs, they have these for floodplain management purposes, the term manufacturer home.

842
01:21:35,362 --> 01:21:46,191
[SPEAKER_00]: also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 consecutive days.

843
01:21:46,952 --> 01:21:55,379
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for insurance purposes, the term manufacture home does not include park trailers, travel trailers, and other similar vehicles.

844
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:59,442
[SPEAKER_00]: So this would be for us to discuss if

845
01:22:00,057 --> 01:22:11,900
[SPEAKER_00]: that last part makes sense in Medford, if it is interesting or is just an addition that does nothing to the, add nothing to the definition.

846
01:22:23,162 --> 01:22:25,663
[SPEAKER_12]: Initial questions from councillors.

847
01:22:34,485 --> 01:22:49,492
[SPEAKER_12]: And so just to clarify, I noticed suggested definitions for sort of differentiating manufactured homes versus tiny houses and keeping the current definition for mobile home.

848
01:22:49,972 --> 01:22:50,252
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

849
01:22:50,472 --> 01:22:54,654
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will add as also from we have manufacturer

850
01:22:56,089 --> 01:22:59,452
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we will have two definitions for a tiny house.

851
01:23:00,173 --> 01:23:04,297
[SPEAKER_00]: One is tiny house movable and the other one is stationary.

852
01:23:05,418 --> 01:23:09,682
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are, it has standards for use in the tiny house.

853
01:23:10,263 --> 01:23:12,405
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is all this part of the standard for use.

854
01:23:12,945 --> 01:23:37,134
[SPEAKER_00]: will be deleted and only the suggested definition is tiny house movable, a transportable dwelling unit built on a frame or chassis with no more than 400 square feet, excluding lots, projections from bay windows, open decks, porches or exterior utility and storage compartments, intended for residential use in an individual house lot where single family dwellings are allowed or as an accessory dwelling unit.

855
01:23:39,179 --> 01:23:46,502
[SPEAKER_00]: All the second part is standard for use, meaning that our standards that we are going to take out from the definition.

856
01:23:48,343 --> 01:23:56,886
[SPEAKER_00]: Then there is the tiny house stationary, which is a dwelling that is 400 square feet or less in floor area excluding lofts.

857
01:23:58,547 --> 01:24:00,888
[SPEAKER_00]: Those will be the three different.

858
01:24:02,309 --> 01:24:06,891
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have four because tiny house is movable and stationary.

859
01:24:10,123 --> 01:24:10,784
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, thank you.

860
01:24:10,844 --> 01:24:21,594
[SPEAKER_12]: So there's a new definition for manufactured, a new definition for tiny and movable, new definition for tiny and stationary, and then the existing definition for mobile home.

861
01:24:22,114 --> 01:24:22,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

862
01:24:22,955 --> 01:24:23,356
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

863
01:24:23,656 --> 01:24:24,997
[SPEAKER_12]: What was, I'm sorry, I didn't quite catch it.

864
01:24:25,017 --> 01:24:29,802
[SPEAKER_12]: You mentioned suggesting a deletion in tiny homes that are movable.

865
01:24:29,842 --> 01:24:33,045
[SPEAKER_12]: Was that just removing the standards for use out of the definition?

866
01:24:33,225 --> 01:24:33,405
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes.

867
01:24:33,866 --> 01:24:34,146
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

868
01:24:43,567 --> 01:24:45,689
[SPEAKER_12]: And is that reflected in the suggested definition?

869
01:24:45,930 --> 01:24:51,576
[SPEAKER_12]: All of the standards for use already encapsulates what was taken out of the suggested definition?

870
01:24:51,616 --> 01:24:59,245
[SPEAKER_12]: Or are there more details that you suggest to remove from the suggested definition for a movable tiny house?

871
01:25:00,956 --> 01:25:08,523
[SPEAKER_00]: As I understand, and sorry for this, I can come back with that because I'm not perfectly sure about that.

872
01:25:10,926 --> 01:25:16,771
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have some comments from Jonathan on this definition.

873
01:25:17,772 --> 01:25:22,955
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, if it's relevant in Medford, uh, these kind of language for the previous one.

874
01:25:23,015 --> 01:25:44,886
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that these seven, we will come back to you, uh, as well, if you need more information, we also wanted to check a bit more of this underlying for the manufacturer home, if it makes sense in Medford or not this, um, manage floodplain management purpose term or insurance purpose, if it makes sense or not.

875
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:54,563
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just wanted to throw it in to see if it's interesting, but we can study it a bit more and come back with this.

876
01:25:57,143 --> 01:25:59,264
[SPEAKER_11]: Could you go back to that slide for a second, please?

877
01:25:59,544 --> 01:26:00,885
[SPEAKER_04]: What is a park trailer?

878
01:26:00,905 --> 01:26:04,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you say a park trailer?

879
01:26:05,406 --> 01:26:08,347
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and here it includes park trailers.

880
01:26:09,467 --> 01:26:12,308
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the insurance for... I think I know what a travel trailer is.

881
01:26:13,486 --> 01:26:24,012
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it means, if you've seen a mobile home park, where it's not designed for you to come and go, it's not a vacation, but they're just built there.

882
01:26:24,412 --> 01:26:33,418
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's, so we would never, I hate to say, I don't like the word never, but we don't have a place in Medford where you would ever say, let's put a mobile home park.

883
01:26:35,519 --> 01:26:40,202
[SPEAKER_01]: One use, and I'm wondering if this has to do with floodplain management, has to do with this,

884
01:26:40,882 --> 01:26:52,032
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one could imagine, though, if a neighborhood in Medford was horribly flooded and homes were destroyed, and we said, but we could put a bunch of trailers at this place.

885
01:26:53,053 --> 01:26:57,117
[SPEAKER_01]: In Pennsylvania, my great-aunt's house, her neighborhood was flooded out.

886
01:26:57,457 --> 01:27:06,966
[SPEAKER_01]: So there was a place nearby where they put a whole lot of these trailers for like a year or two where people lived while their houses were being renovated and fixed.

887
01:27:07,768 --> 01:27:12,911
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if that happened here, I'm not clear where we would even do that, right?

888
01:27:12,951 --> 01:27:14,872
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, could you put one?

889
01:27:15,312 --> 01:27:22,277
[SPEAKER_01]: So there might, and this might be a question for the building commissioner, I have seen a use where house has fire.

890
01:27:23,177 --> 01:27:36,705
[SPEAKER_01]: person puts a temporary manufactured home in the driveway where they live while their house is being rebuilt, rather than living in a hotel or a rental home or something.

891
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:43,850
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember that happened on Park Street, I think, in Medford, because I used to drive by it on my way to the Roberts School.

892
01:27:45,450 --> 01:27:47,971
[SPEAKER_01]: So one could imagine that that could occur.

893
01:27:48,051 --> 01:27:53,573
[SPEAKER_01]: So part of the purpose would be to have something so that you could put something in zoning.

894
01:27:53,933 --> 01:28:02,895
[SPEAKER_01]: So like you might not say they're allowed in these zones, but you could say in the text, they're allowed under these conditions, right?

895
01:28:03,015 --> 01:28:11,138
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, you may put a manufactured home on your property for no more than one year while you are renovating your house.

896
01:28:12,550 --> 01:28:15,172
[SPEAKER_01]: it could be cheaper than living in a hotel or something.

897
01:28:15,192 --> 01:28:21,837
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we did that on the road behind me as well.

898
01:28:22,257 --> 01:28:27,521
[SPEAKER_01]: There was one there for like about a year while the house was being renovated.

899
01:28:28,867 --> 01:28:39,019
[SPEAKER_01]: So by having the definition, it allows us to then add these things, these kinds of rules in, as opposed to just saying, oh, well, what zone would we allow these to happen in?

900
01:28:39,299 --> 01:28:42,502
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't be a zone, it would be under what conditions would we allow these?

901
01:28:43,840 --> 01:29:01,867
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and I will say that I have had, there is a use case for a tiny home right now, we're not really sure what to do, but there is a three-family house where, according to the neighbors, more than 30 years ago, they finished the garage, they put a bathroom in there.

902
01:29:02,868 --> 01:29:08,130
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're being asked, can we make that a fourth unit on this property?

903
01:29:09,050 --> 01:29:09,810
[SPEAKER_01]: It exists.

904
01:29:12,108 --> 01:29:15,591
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so far out of zoning that it's in a single family district.

905
01:29:16,332 --> 01:29:23,238
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it would be a fourth unit on the property in a single family and it's separate, it's detached from the existing structure.

906
01:29:23,258 --> 01:29:26,141
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you consider that?

907
01:29:26,901 --> 01:29:28,403
[SPEAKER_01]: It literally is a tiny home.

908
01:29:28,443 --> 01:29:30,124
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be if they put a kitchen in there.

909
01:29:30,144 --> 01:29:31,866
[SPEAKER_01]: It just-

910
01:29:34,173 --> 01:29:35,855
[SPEAKER_01]: would be kind of like a permanent ADU.

911
01:29:35,875 --> 01:29:43,221
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason this, so our ADUs are only, let's not go too far down the rat hole, but require owner occupied.

912
01:29:44,562 --> 01:29:47,765
[SPEAKER_01]: At this time, that owner, the owner does not live in that property.

913
01:29:51,028 --> 01:29:57,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and an ADU under our current definition is an accessory used to a single family house, not a three family.

914
01:29:59,932 --> 01:30:07,737
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just raise it because we discussed with the property owner today the fact that it literally could be a tiny house.

915
01:30:08,357 --> 01:30:09,878
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've had people advocate for it.

916
01:30:10,158 --> 01:30:15,541
[SPEAKER_01]: There was somebody who's had a table several years at the Energy Festival advocating for tiny houses in Medford.

917
01:30:16,322 --> 01:30:17,202
[SPEAKER_01]: They're adorable.

918
01:30:17,723 --> 01:30:19,584
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was single, I would consider it.

919
01:30:19,984 --> 01:30:22,245
[SPEAKER_05]: That's interesting.

920
01:30:22,685 --> 01:30:23,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't realize we did it that way.

921
01:30:23,966 --> 01:30:28,269
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I knew about the under occupancy, but I didn't think about single family only instead of just

922
01:30:29,688 --> 01:30:33,970
[SPEAKER_04]: a structure, a separate detached structure.

923
01:30:35,310 --> 01:30:44,034
[SPEAKER_10]: I will say I'm particularly fond of tiny homes, given especially how much demand we have for one bedrooms and two bedrooms that we don't have.

924
01:30:44,074 --> 01:30:46,095
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think having a definition would be great.

925
01:30:47,975 --> 01:30:53,898
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess I would recommend that we include these definitions, and then later we decide what to do with them.

926
01:31:02,997 --> 01:31:14,347
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really, I was just thinking of the tiny homes would become more useful if we were starting to look at dimensional, small, non-conforming lots, 2,000 square feet, 2,500 square feet.

927
01:31:14,388 --> 01:31:23,036
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you could put a tiny home by right, something like that, where it's really like a tiny little lot that we can't do anything with right now, but maybe that use would make sense.

928
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:35,128
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the ideas in the housing production plan is that for lots that are undersized, we allow affordable housing by right.

929
01:31:35,888 --> 01:31:42,493
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can do a deed-restricted affordable housing unit, but not a regular house.

930
01:31:42,753 --> 01:31:44,094
[SPEAKER_07]: That's infill zoning, right?

931
01:31:44,334 --> 01:31:44,514
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.

932
01:31:45,575 --> 01:31:46,616
[SPEAKER_07]: That's gonna be part of this?

933
01:31:47,857 --> 01:31:49,218
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be later.

934
01:31:51,499 --> 01:31:53,900
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's one of the things we need to look at.

935
01:31:54,020 --> 01:32:08,025
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the discussions of, sorry, I forget the terms that were used, but the analysis, the mapping analysis is to look at how many, so our minimum square footage for a lot is 5,000 square feet.

936
01:32:09,646 --> 01:32:14,968
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe off the top of my head, 70 to 80% of our lots are smaller than that.

937
01:32:16,349 --> 01:32:19,050
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, is that really actually the right lot size?

938
01:32:19,870 --> 01:32:22,392
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a bigger conversation.

939
01:32:22,412 --> 01:32:27,776
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the ones that we need a bunch of data in order to have that conversation.

940
01:32:28,797 --> 01:32:29,257
[SPEAKER_12]: Certainly.

941
01:32:29,417 --> 01:32:43,207
[SPEAKER_12]: And before we cap off the discussion of this definition, I would say I think it dovetails nicely because I think one of our many motivations for getting through, maybe we're stretching the definition of all this being low-hanging fruit.

942
01:32:43,227 --> 01:32:49,112
[SPEAKER_12]: But one of the motivations for getting through the low-hanging fruit by the end of this fiscal year so that we can get into

943
01:32:49,727 --> 01:32:59,410
[SPEAKER_12]: those themes of great substance outlined in the climate action adaptation plan, the housing production plan, after we dispense with this kind of update round.

944
01:33:00,731 --> 01:33:13,916
[SPEAKER_12]: So it would be great to, in this process, pass some definitions that we can then consider in the context of implementing the HPP, infill, zoning, and many other mechanisms when we're getting into those kind of topic areas later in the year.

945
01:33:15,096 --> 01:33:17,417
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think this is very proactive.

946
01:33:19,446 --> 01:33:25,161
[SPEAKER_12]: Any additional comments on manufactured, mobile, and teeny tiny homes before we move on?

947
01:33:27,727 --> 01:33:28,108
[SPEAKER_12]: Councilor Loewen?

948
01:33:30,225 --> 01:33:31,566
[SPEAKER_07]: just a technical thing.

949
01:33:31,606 --> 01:33:38,828
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think at the end of this is going to say that we're going to start talking about ADUs pretty like pretty soon after this.

950
01:33:39,428 --> 01:33:53,613
[SPEAKER_07]: So I so will it and I'm not I'm not sure if the will the definition of tiny home necessarily be settled by the time we actually get to the ADU discussion because tiny homes are as it says here a part of they can be an ADU.

951
01:33:54,573 --> 01:33:57,394
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that we can talk about this at the end of the meeting.

952
01:33:57,414 --> 01:33:58,134
[SPEAKER_12]: I believe that on the

953
01:33:58,598 --> 01:34:05,721
[SPEAKER_12]: draft agenda was to propose to have an initial discussion about the proposed ADU ordinance in two weeks.

954
01:34:06,241 --> 01:34:18,246
[SPEAKER_12]: So certainly none of these definitions will be codified by then, but I certainly don't see why we can't be having these discussions in parallel since, of course, the ADU ordinance is not something that we're going to report out in one meeting anyway.

955
01:34:22,167 --> 01:34:26,669
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and just to clarify before your question, this is standard for use.

956
01:34:27,612 --> 01:34:28,632
[SPEAKER_00]: are not on your current.

957
01:34:28,652 --> 01:34:31,494
[SPEAKER_00]: This is from the House Bill 1359.

958
01:34:33,854 --> 01:34:48,480
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we have done is just the suggested definition is that side, that part, and the rest of the definition, those are the standards for use that we wouldn't use in the definition, just to clarify that part.

959
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:54,342
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only definition that we haven't met for at the moment is the mobile home.

960
01:34:54,918 --> 01:35:02,585
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the suggested definitions are manufactured and tiny home, one movable and the other stationary.

961
01:35:04,146 --> 01:35:04,386
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

962
01:35:04,546 --> 01:35:04,927
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

963
01:35:04,947 --> 01:35:06,468
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I appreciate that clarity.

964
01:35:10,631 --> 01:35:10,872
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

965
01:35:11,072 --> 01:35:13,514
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, let's see what's next.

966
01:35:16,577 --> 01:35:19,179
[SPEAKER_00]: The next definition, motor vehicles class three.

967
01:35:21,627 --> 01:35:27,672
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we also added junkyards as a possible use to be prohibited and to clarify these two uses.

968
01:35:28,292 --> 01:35:31,395
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first definition is class three motor vehicle sales.

969
01:35:31,835 --> 01:35:43,444
[SPEAKER_00]: Principal business is one buying used vehicles for purpose of remodeling, taking apart or rebuilding and selling the same or two buying or selling parts from used vehicles or tires.

970
01:35:44,586 --> 01:35:47,287
[SPEAKER_00]: or the assembling of used vehicle parts.

971
01:35:47,887 --> 01:35:49,867
[SPEAKER_00]: This is definition one.

972
01:35:50,047 --> 01:36:01,849
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the junkyards that we also propose as something that maybe you want to define to prohibit is the junkyards or automobile graveyard.

973
01:36:02,069 --> 01:36:06,190
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can go back to first the class three motor vehicle sales.

974
01:36:10,330 --> 01:36:13,411
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are any questions or comments, appreciate it.

975
01:36:13,491 --> 01:36:13,771
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

976
01:36:18,072 --> 01:36:25,759
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's helpful for you to know that the building commissioner noted that this class three motor vehicle sales is not defined in our zoning.

977
01:36:25,919 --> 01:36:33,566
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently he's run into this as being a problem because it's unclear whether or not it's allowed because it's undefined.

978
01:36:38,290 --> 01:36:40,672
[SPEAKER_11]: Any initial questions or comments from councilors?

979
01:36:48,639 --> 01:36:56,183
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, appreciate the collaboration with the building commissioner on this.

980
01:36:56,223 --> 01:37:06,187
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, as we've stated before, part of the goal of this is to just clear up areas of known confusion and roadblocks in how the zoning ordinance is currently used.

981
01:37:06,207 --> 01:37:09,509
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's great to be able to incorporate his feedback that this is causing problems.

982
01:37:09,549 --> 01:37:13,090
[SPEAKER_12]: The definition would help smooth things out.

983
01:37:16,212 --> 01:37:16,672
[SPEAKER_12]: Shall we move on?

984
01:37:19,776 --> 01:37:41,861
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next definition, then, is junkyards or automobile graveyard, the use of any area or any lot, whether inside or outside of a building, for the storage, keeping, or abandonment of junk, scrap, or discarded materials, or the dismantling, demolition, or abandonment of automobiles and other vehicles, machinery, or parts thereof.

985
01:37:45,681 --> 01:37:46,001
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

986
01:37:46,021 --> 01:37:47,782
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think you mentioned on the previous slide that one

987
01:37:49,946 --> 01:37:53,268
[SPEAKER_12]: defining this was mainly to be able to prohibit them.

988
01:37:53,308 --> 01:37:54,228
[SPEAKER_12]: Could you speak more to that?

989
01:37:54,548 --> 01:37:54,849
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

990
01:37:56,029 --> 01:38:02,112
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we have a definition and then therefore we can prohibit this kind of uses.

991
01:38:04,333 --> 01:38:05,094
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, thank you.

992
01:38:05,614 --> 01:38:15,019
[SPEAKER_13]: Is that... These tables are so long.

993
01:38:15,894 --> 01:38:29,085
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do allow, and we have by special permit, various kinds of, for example, one says motor vehicle sales or rental of new vehicles only.

994
01:38:29,345 --> 01:38:33,108
[SPEAKER_01]: One says outdoor meeting motor vehicle sales and storage.

995
01:38:33,608 --> 01:38:39,513
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's motor vehicle sales and storage outdoor in class two used motor vehicle.

996
01:38:40,714 --> 01:38:44,477
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think there might be an argument that, well,

997
01:38:45,578 --> 01:39:05,500
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have class three so does that mean you know it it falls under the class two i i just it it seemed confusing and perhaps we have been getting phone calls from people who would like to move these uses to medford and if it was clear that it's listed as not allowed then it's it's not a discretion and it's not an opinion

998
01:39:10,520 --> 01:39:19,223
[SPEAKER_01]: But I will note at this time, we're only recommending to add the definitions, and we can argue about whether or not we should prohibit them in another meeting.

999
01:39:19,383 --> 01:39:23,984
[SPEAKER_01]: But if anybody is watching and has a strong opinion on that, they should let us know.

1000
01:39:24,004 --> 01:39:29,105
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1001
01:39:29,125 --> 01:39:31,126
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's helpful context for this change here.

1002
01:39:33,387 --> 01:39:37,448
[SPEAKER_12]: Any additional comments at this time on junkyards or automobile graveyards?

1003
01:39:40,106 --> 01:39:47,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, let's move on.

1004
01:39:47,348 --> 01:39:52,189
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, then it was to clarify accessory structure and accessory use.

1005
01:39:53,270 --> 01:40:00,311
[SPEAKER_00]: The current definition that Medfair has for accessory structure, we do not change, it's the same.

1006
01:40:00,972 --> 01:40:03,612
[SPEAKER_00]: And we propose a new one that is accessory use.

1007
01:40:04,393 --> 01:40:09,874
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a use customarily incidental to and on the same lot or group of lots

1008
01:40:10,632 --> 01:40:12,653
[SPEAKER_00]: as a conforming principle use.

1009
01:40:15,953 --> 01:40:22,315
[SPEAKER_12]: And so the suggestion here, just to paraphrase what you just said, is to keep our current definition but pull out those dimensional standards.

1010
01:40:23,015 --> 01:40:23,415
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1011
01:40:31,457 --> 01:40:33,698
[SPEAKER_12]: Any comments or questions?

1012
01:40:36,339 --> 01:40:36,899
[SPEAKER_12]: President Bears?

1013
01:40:37,967 --> 01:40:42,531
[SPEAKER_05]: Just with the, do we think this is a typo where it just says accessory, and it should say accessory use?

1014
01:40:42,731 --> 01:40:44,773
[SPEAKER_05]: Or would the definition of accessory stay?

1015
01:40:45,774 --> 01:40:58,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Or would we just get rid of the, and as referred to in this chapter, also means a use which does not alter or impair the character of the premises on which it's located or of the neighborhood?

1016
01:40:59,566 --> 01:41:00,087
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just wondering.

1017
01:41:02,625 --> 01:41:08,921
[SPEAKER_05]: If we're just adding the word use and taking out that second clause, or if we're adding a whole other definition that mirrors the.

1018
01:41:13,206 --> 01:41:18,048
[SPEAKER_01]: to have a definition for accessory structure and a definition for accessory use.

1019
01:41:18,708 --> 01:41:19,768
[SPEAKER_01]: I was confused by that.

1020
01:41:20,149 --> 01:41:23,090
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just a definition for accessory, which seems... Yes.

1021
01:41:23,490 --> 01:41:24,270
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, okay.

1022
01:41:24,330 --> 01:41:30,392
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that what the recommendation is here is two definitions.

1023
01:41:30,693 --> 01:41:36,875
[SPEAKER_01]: One definition for accessory structure and a separate definition for accessory use.

1024
01:41:37,526 --> 01:41:39,627
[SPEAKER_05]: There is already an accessory structure definition.

1025
01:41:39,747 --> 01:41:40,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there?

1026
01:41:40,147 --> 01:41:40,467
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

1027
01:41:40,507 --> 01:41:40,748
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1028
01:41:40,988 --> 01:41:47,271
[SPEAKER_00]: So we keep the current definition of accessory structure that is kept the same.

1029
01:41:48,231 --> 01:41:55,415
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on accessory use, we add the definition of accessory use, which is

1030
01:41:57,605 --> 01:41:58,546
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have this one?

1031
01:41:58,726 --> 01:42:01,888
[SPEAKER_13]: There's this, but it's just the word accessory.

1032
01:42:01,948 --> 01:42:04,050
[SPEAKER_10]: It says accessory, but it's very clearly a use.

1033
01:42:04,210 --> 01:42:05,871
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like a use.

1034
01:42:06,432 --> 01:42:08,854
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's pretty clear, the exact same word.

1035
01:42:09,214 --> 01:42:18,221
[SPEAKER_10]: So it sounds like you're saying that the not changing the character of the premises of a neighborhood is a standard, and you want to remove that?

1036
01:42:22,424 --> 01:42:23,345
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly, vague.

1037
01:42:24,305 --> 01:42:26,107
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a very vague standard.

1038
01:42:31,559 --> 01:42:32,940
[SPEAKER_13]: I will have to check this one.

1039
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:33,900
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fine with it.

1040
01:42:33,940 --> 01:42:40,263
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't think we want to end up with something that says accessory that then says exactly the same thing as accessory use, except for one phrase.

1041
01:42:40,904 --> 01:42:41,124
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1042
01:42:41,144 --> 01:42:42,164
[SPEAKER_11]: Just make sure that we're.

1043
01:42:42,884 --> 01:42:43,085
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1044
01:42:43,125 --> 01:42:53,750
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm, what I understand is that you have two, one is accessory and that we changed the name to accessory use.

1045
01:42:54,050 --> 01:42:58,512
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we just take from that one, the standards are removed from that one.

1046
01:42:59,318 --> 01:43:01,919
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also have accessory structure.

1047
01:43:02,539 --> 01:43:04,140
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that one, we keep as it is.

1048
01:43:04,180 --> 01:43:04,560
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1049
01:43:04,660 --> 01:43:04,880
[SPEAKER_13]: Great.

1050
01:43:08,562 --> 01:43:09,542
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, I am so sorry.

1051
01:43:09,662 --> 01:43:11,203
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm going to need you to repeat that one more time.

1052
01:43:11,623 --> 01:43:11,803
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

1053
01:43:12,063 --> 01:43:16,905
[SPEAKER_12]: We have accessory structure, accessory use, and accessory, which are being kept and which are moving.

1054
01:43:17,085 --> 01:43:18,906
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't have accessory use right now.

1055
01:43:18,926 --> 01:43:19,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1056
01:43:19,286 --> 01:43:19,686
[SPEAKER_12]: That is new.

1057
01:43:25,959 --> 01:43:26,760
[SPEAKER_01]: could have been a typo.

1058
01:43:26,780 --> 01:43:30,562
[SPEAKER_12]: The existing definition of accessory is becoming the definition for accessory use.

1059
01:43:30,783 --> 01:43:31,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1060
01:43:31,663 --> 01:43:32,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1061
01:43:32,324 --> 01:43:41,850
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you actually clarify, Paula, when you say remove the standards, do you mean remove the words that say do not alter the or impair the character of premises?

1062
01:43:41,870 --> 01:43:42,931
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you mean?

1063
01:43:43,371 --> 01:43:46,793
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that is just until principal use.

1064
01:43:46,953 --> 01:43:52,377
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use customarily incidental to and on the same lot or group of lots as conforming principal use.

1065
01:43:53,037 --> 01:43:54,018
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the part of

1066
01:43:54,682 --> 01:44:05,506
[SPEAKER_00]: And as referred to in this chapter, also means a use which does not alter or impair the character of the premises on which it is located or of the neighborhood that part is removed.

1067
01:44:07,407 --> 01:44:11,149
[SPEAKER_00]: We will write everything in so it's more clear.

1068
01:44:13,530 --> 01:44:14,530
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sorry.

1069
01:44:15,971 --> 01:44:16,551
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, thank you.

1070
01:44:16,571 --> 01:44:17,411
[SPEAKER_12]: That will help clarify.

1071
01:44:26,266 --> 01:44:33,510
[SPEAKER_12]: Any additional comments on accessory structure and accessory use?

1072
01:44:35,091 --> 01:44:38,433
[SPEAKER_12]: Director Hunt, did you have something?

1073
01:44:40,814 --> 01:44:45,598
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't mind, I'm going to also ask Paula for the team for another thing that we just noticed.

1074
01:44:45,998 --> 01:44:49,601
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of places where it would help to have cross-references.

1075
01:44:50,042 --> 01:44:56,187
[SPEAKER_01]: And the example is that in the under use, we have use, principle, but no use, accessory.

1076
01:44:56,988 --> 01:45:07,556
[SPEAKER_01]: It would make sense to perhaps have their use, accessory, see accessory use, so that people realize that it's defined, but don't actually define it twice.

1077
01:45:08,462 --> 01:45:26,259
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then if there's a place that says principal use, see use, you know, so basically there are a couple of places where I think when we bring this list, we will also bring some cross references because the format, um, I think I realize not all of you have gone through the zoning thing before.

1078
01:45:26,659 --> 01:45:33,546
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have to bring the exact language that we want the zoning to show and we'll say in section definitions.

1079
01:45:34,206 --> 01:45:37,407
[SPEAKER_01]: add this language, strike this language.

1080
01:45:37,787 --> 01:45:47,270
[SPEAKER_01]: So we may bring a couple, for example, I'm going to ask right now that we add use comma accessory, see accessory use.

1081
01:45:47,851 --> 01:45:51,312
[SPEAKER_05]: It also might be worth doing structure comma accessory because there's structure.

1082
01:45:51,392 --> 01:45:51,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

1083
01:45:51,692 --> 01:45:54,833
[SPEAKER_05]: Although it just says structure, it doesn't say structure comma principle, so.

1084
01:45:55,580 --> 01:46:07,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and so I'm thinking that we might ask if one of their consultants can take some look for places where we may need these cross-references to help clear things up.

1085
01:46:10,166 --> 01:46:20,511
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually, if I may, it might be worth striking and replacing the whole section.

1086
01:46:22,079 --> 01:46:26,823
[SPEAKER_05]: like just writing up the new section as we want it, rather than doing the whole definitions.

1087
01:46:27,323 --> 01:46:36,891
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think we still also have this issue where we have the zoning changes that we made last fall, which we're still waiting to get back from KP Law to add to Muni Code.

1088
01:46:36,991 --> 01:46:44,197
[SPEAKER_05]: So once Muni Code doesn't reflect those changes, it might be worth, yeah.

1089
01:46:44,858 --> 01:46:45,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1090
01:46:45,679 --> 01:46:54,904
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to make sure that it's clear to the development board and the public, which are the things that are different and which are the things that are untouched.

1091
01:46:55,644 --> 01:47:02,248
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like just a full document with everything that is red is new or something like that.

1092
01:47:02,268 --> 01:47:02,428
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1093
01:47:02,448 --> 01:47:12,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we could do a red line version, but also a start could replace like as the formal, like the red line version could be a supporting document, but that the formal

1094
01:47:14,175 --> 01:47:18,678
[SPEAKER_05]: thing that we're doing is striking and replacing the full section just to make sure that we have everything that we want.

1095
01:47:22,841 --> 01:47:24,161
[SPEAKER_05]: But I agree we should have a red line.

1096
01:47:25,362 --> 01:47:27,023
[SPEAKER_05]: It might even need to be a red line and a green line.

1097
01:47:27,043 --> 01:47:32,967
[SPEAKER_05]: We might want to also have, make sure people can see what was changed last fall when we passed that.

1098
01:47:32,987 --> 01:47:38,411
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1099
01:47:39,731 --> 01:47:40,032
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.

1100
01:47:40,132 --> 01:47:42,913
[SPEAKER_10]: I apologize, but I will have to leave due to family

1101
01:47:44,215 --> 01:47:45,076
[SPEAKER_10]: Not quite emergency.

1102
01:47:46,777 --> 01:47:55,044
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just want to ask a pre-question before we start discussing the coverage of lot and ask whether we need any kind of a definition of permeable surfaces.

1103
01:47:55,064 --> 01:48:04,191
[SPEAKER_10]: If we're going to be adding something in about percentage of lots or amount of permeable surface, something like that.

1104
01:48:04,211 --> 01:48:08,375
[SPEAKER_10]: I just wanted to toss that in there to see if that can be discussed in this last.

1105
01:48:38,022 --> 01:48:49,986
[SPEAKER_11]: Sorry, was that to put a pin in that discussion or to... We'll put it on the list.

1106
01:48:50,066 --> 01:48:50,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

1107
01:48:50,326 --> 01:48:50,726
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

1108
01:48:50,826 --> 01:48:52,567
[SPEAKER_01]: Permeable surfaces.

1109
01:49:00,362 --> 01:49:01,283
[SPEAKER_11]: Great.

1110
01:49:02,084 --> 01:49:15,674
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that takes us from our discussion of various accessories to actually move on to the replacement of coverage of lot with lot coverage and adding accessory buildings.

1111
01:49:17,055 --> 01:49:18,196
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1112
01:49:18,236 --> 01:49:26,583
[SPEAKER_00]: So lot coverage, what we have is maintain the met for one with just one change.

1113
01:49:26,703 --> 01:49:27,824
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the one you see here.

1114
01:49:28,365 --> 01:49:39,290
[SPEAKER_00]: So lot coverage, the percentage of the total lot area occupied by all the structures on a lot, exclusive of unenclosed porches and bay windows.

1115
01:49:40,411 --> 01:49:55,378
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were talking about this one, we would also like to see what is the current of your definition for footprint, if you have, and why it is exclusive of this unenclosed porches and bay windows.

1116
01:49:58,590 --> 01:50:01,652
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the question that we would like to make to you.

1117
01:50:02,272 --> 01:50:08,035
[SPEAKER_12]: The question is whether to have it exclude unenclosed porches and bay windows or to have those be included?

1118
01:50:08,375 --> 01:50:09,836
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1119
01:50:09,896 --> 01:50:11,376
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no definition of footprint.

1120
01:50:11,656 --> 01:50:16,019
[SPEAKER_05]: There is gross floor area, which mentions the same things.

1121
01:50:16,299 --> 01:50:16,519
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1122
01:50:16,539 --> 01:50:19,520
[SPEAKER_04]: But it doesn't mention bay windows, but it mentions unenclosed porches.

1123
01:50:23,002 --> 01:50:23,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question about this.

1124
01:50:24,043 --> 01:50:24,663
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually don't...

1125
01:50:27,463 --> 01:50:33,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Only for the reason that if we change this now before we change other things later, it's going to mean we can build fewer things in the interim.

1126
01:50:34,856 --> 01:50:39,765
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the intent to change it just because it doesn't make sense that lock coverage wouldn't include a non-principal structure?

1127
01:50:41,220 --> 01:51:06,695
[SPEAKER_05]: because I think logically that's true, but also I think if we go down this road, then between now and whenever, if ever, there's an adjustment, it just means it's less likely to build an ADU based on lot coverage, detached ADU, or we have these situations where we have detached structures, and I'm guessing if they're not the principal structure, they're currently not counting towards lot coverage, which means that you can actually build a little bit more on the lot.

1128
01:51:07,596 --> 01:51:09,717
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just from the pure perspective of,

1129
01:51:11,152 --> 01:51:16,293
[SPEAKER_05]: of I think we all agree that the dimensional requirements are kind of nuts.

1130
01:51:16,653 --> 01:51:26,655
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is going to add further burden on the dimensional requirements to make this change, even though I agree that logically it doesn't make any sense that a non-principle structure is not included in the law coverage measurement.

1131
01:51:27,535 --> 01:51:38,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think it could create a negative impact in the interim between fixing this definition and then fixing the dimensional requirements and the law coverage requirements.

1132
01:51:39,511 --> 01:51:42,332
[SPEAKER_00]: so that this will be fixed after that?

1133
01:51:42,792 --> 01:51:44,192
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just throwing it out there.

1134
01:51:44,212 --> 01:51:50,334
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, since we're coming back in a couple of weeks, just to put that one out there.

1135
01:51:51,594 --> 01:51:54,715
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's assume that we don't address dimensional requirements.

1136
01:51:54,735 --> 01:51:57,595
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we all agree we're going to do that as part of this project, but let's just assume we don't.

1137
01:51:57,775 --> 01:51:59,136
[SPEAKER_05]: And then suddenly this stays there.

1138
01:51:59,156 --> 01:52:01,616
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think it means less stuff gets built.

1139
01:52:02,096 --> 01:52:09,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Fewer ADEs are going to be able to be permanent because of a lot coverage dimensional requirement.

1140
01:52:11,922 --> 01:52:17,808
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't know how building is currently interpreting this anyway, so I guess that's my one caveat.

1141
01:52:17,828 --> 01:52:25,255
[SPEAKER_05]: If they're saying it obviously doesn't make sense that block coverage wouldn't include all the structures on the lot, then my point is proved.

1142
01:52:28,166 --> 01:52:28,446
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1143
01:52:28,466 --> 01:52:28,726
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1144
01:52:28,866 --> 01:52:37,713
[SPEAKER_01]: And we absolutely have to look at our lot coverages because it says things like 30% of the lot coverage is allowed with a multi-dwelling.

1145
01:52:38,153 --> 01:52:42,916
[SPEAKER_01]: And do we really want these small, these buildings sitting in the middle of a big open space?

1146
01:52:42,996 --> 01:52:44,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's... It's nuts.

1147
01:52:45,378 --> 01:52:45,558
Right.

1148
01:52:46,699 --> 01:52:47,480
[SPEAKER_04]: My words, not yours.

1149
01:52:49,821 --> 01:52:52,803
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's just what I'm concerned about is like right now, great.

1150
01:52:52,863 --> 01:52:57,126
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to have an ADU, if it's a 30% lot coverage and you put the ADU, it doesn't count towards that.

1151
01:52:58,160 --> 01:52:59,441
[SPEAKER_05]: The lot's a little more covered.

1152
01:52:59,681 --> 01:53:04,303
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm not also advocating that we get rid of all permeable services or anything with anyone.

1153
01:53:05,483 --> 01:53:06,343
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I don't know.

1154
01:53:06,403 --> 01:53:21,350
[SPEAKER_05]: It just seems to me to be a point where the illogical structure of our zoning ordinance and the illogical wording of this definition, which is more illogical, is kind of where I'm at.

1155
01:53:23,723 --> 01:53:24,663
[SPEAKER_05]: To me, it's the dimension.

1156
01:53:24,703 --> 01:53:29,845
[SPEAKER_01]: So do we say put a pin in it and that we add, we make this change when we change the dimensions?

1157
01:53:30,205 --> 01:53:31,165
[SPEAKER_05]: That's my suggestion.

1158
01:53:31,205 --> 01:53:35,126
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just my, but I'm also open to an argument in the other direction.

1159
01:53:35,826 --> 01:53:45,089
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I don't, I'm not strongly, I just think that's the only, only negative consequence I could see in the short term of making this change before we adjust the lot coverage requirements themselves.

1160
01:53:52,591 --> 01:53:54,112
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, to me, it also makes sense.

1161
01:53:54,252 --> 01:53:58,716
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we can do is see if that will affect a lot what you already have.

1162
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:03,819
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it does, in fact, affect a lot, then we just keep it as it is.

1163
01:54:04,540 --> 01:54:05,741
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will do it later on.

1164
01:54:06,061 --> 01:54:06,261
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1165
01:54:06,982 --> 01:54:07,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1166
01:54:07,242 --> 01:54:11,685
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think my general principle on a lot of this is that we don't want to do something early on.

1167
01:54:12,326 --> 01:54:21,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think we ever want to make a change that's going to reduce the buildability of the lots, even if eventually we'll make a change that will rectify that.

1168
01:54:23,459 --> 01:54:37,153
[SPEAKER_12]: So it seems like the question is we could refer this up and correct me if I've misheard, perhaps refer out to building for their assessment on if this change would reduce buildability or if it wouldn't make a difference in the interim based on how they're currently interpreting.

1169
01:54:45,502 --> 01:54:46,483
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm open to other approaches.

1170
01:54:48,956 --> 01:54:50,037
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be fine with me.

1171
01:54:50,057 --> 01:54:59,905
[SPEAKER_05]: I also just like the idea of putting a pin in it and coming back, maybe making it part of the dimensional requirements discussion to update this definition and any other definitions.

1172
01:55:02,548 --> 01:55:07,592
[SPEAKER_12]: It would make sense to lump by scene if we revisit this with dimensionals.

1173
01:55:11,736 --> 01:55:16,520
[SPEAKER_12]: Would it be possible to make a note of that somewhere in our work plan so that we don't

1174
01:55:20,270 --> 01:55:21,031
[SPEAKER_11]: lose track of this.

1175
01:55:29,116 --> 01:55:33,959
[SPEAKER_12]: I will make a note of that as well for updating our work plan and memo.

1176
01:55:34,039 --> 01:55:43,446
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that takes us to, unless there's further comment on this one, I think that takes us to our second to last, trying to be clarified.

1177
01:55:44,252 --> 01:55:51,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, these are still under review and so we have the yards versus setbacks.

1178
01:55:52,676 --> 01:55:59,180
[SPEAKER_00]: What I've seen in zoning is that sometimes are a bit mixed these two and it's a bit unclear.

1179
01:56:01,281 --> 01:56:10,971
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that to be more consistent, it would be interesting to just go for or yards or setbacks throughout the whole document.

1180
01:56:12,473 --> 01:56:15,576
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are sometimes that these definitions might be also

1181
01:56:16,460 --> 01:56:22,725
[SPEAKER_00]: might be useful to use some diagrams also to explain them that are a lot more visual.

1182
01:56:23,927 --> 01:56:27,930
[SPEAKER_00]: And some communities have been adding some diagrams with the definitions.

1183
01:56:28,651 --> 01:56:33,595
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe these are the ones that we would like to, like yards and setbacks to explain it.

1184
01:56:35,156 --> 01:56:37,558
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, these are still under review.

1185
01:56:38,899 --> 01:56:42,523
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the definition of medical uses is as well under review.

1186
01:56:44,952 --> 01:56:48,715
[SPEAKER_00]: If there are any comments that you want to give us, they are welcome.

1187
01:56:50,857 --> 01:56:57,022
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to throw out there that I don't see setback in the definition or the use table, or sorry, the dimensional table.

1188
01:56:58,123 --> 01:57:00,765
[SPEAKER_05]: And now looking through it, but it is spread everywhere else.

1189
01:57:01,365 --> 01:57:05,469
[SPEAKER_05]: But my favorite thing is in the plain development district, we have something called the yard setback.

1190
01:57:09,492 --> 01:57:11,794
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to get really, I don't even know.

1191
01:57:17,927 --> 01:57:22,109
[SPEAKER_12]: Great, well that takes us to the end of our review of the definitions.

1192
01:57:22,189 --> 01:57:30,092
[SPEAKER_12]: I know I was trying to flag as we went through the ones that were clarified at the outset that this is still under review, there's still research being done.

1193
01:57:31,773 --> 01:57:39,096
[SPEAKER_12]: I flagged a few items where we want to add a piece of homework for NS Associates.

1194
01:57:42,838 --> 01:57:44,579
[SPEAKER_12]: For example, we want to

1195
01:57:45,560 --> 01:57:53,682
[SPEAKER_12]: try to capture our conversation about the multifamily dwellings to come back with kind of a more comprehensive proposal.

1196
01:58:00,723 --> 01:58:06,084
[SPEAKER_12]: Ditto, I think, for our discussion of household, though I don't

1197
01:58:11,994 --> 01:58:38,346
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know if we arrived at a resolution in our conversation about household, if we are trying to advance something in two weeks, or if that's a conversation that we're going to put aside, I think, when we're developing new uses and are kind of more... I think that I liked a lot what President Zuckerberg said, to have a bunch of all these definitions together and all the...

1198
01:58:39,016 --> 01:59:01,033
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's a short-stay lodging, all the ways that people can live together in different ways and have all those definitions and bring it to the table to see if we have any questions, if there are need some additional

1199
01:59:04,102 --> 01:59:06,524
[SPEAKER_00]: definitions if there needs any changes.

1200
01:59:07,765 --> 01:59:08,666
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that a lot.

1201
01:59:08,786 --> 01:59:11,429
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will try to prepare for it the next two weeks.

1202
01:59:11,529 --> 01:59:22,939
[SPEAKER_00]: So in two weeks, all this bunch of different definitions from different areas and how that will fit into MedFER zoning.

1203
01:59:23,359 --> 01:59:23,580
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.

1204
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:28,004
[SPEAKER_05]: And if that's a project that is bigger than two weeks, I don't think there's an issue.

1205
01:59:29,308 --> 01:59:57,666
[SPEAKER_05]: like if I was going through this I would say that one and Lock coverage being lumped in with dimensional part requirements could be like two things that maybe are worth saying are happening after but like the medical uses Medical uses the The actual dwelling stuff like around the one two three multi and the

1206
01:59:59,120 --> 02:00:15,212
[SPEAKER_05]: eating establishments, like those are things I think, if I was picking and choosing what to do in two weeks and what maybe needs a bigger conversation, I would say that the household, different ways that people live and the lot coverage dimensional requirements would be things we'd maybe punt.

1207
02:00:15,312 --> 02:00:25,880
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd like to leave this idea of like, let's put in these different things now on the one unit, two unit, three unit, multi-unit thing, and then we can work all that out later.

1208
02:00:26,874 --> 02:00:29,796
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think, yeah, that's just my suggestion again.

1209
02:00:29,876 --> 02:00:35,160
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you guys think it's doable to talk about dormitory lodging, multi-tenant.

1210
02:00:39,163 --> 02:00:44,907
[SPEAKER_12]: I think our organizing principle here, which I think is a really good one, is to be bundling things by category.

1211
02:00:44,987 --> 02:00:50,751
[SPEAKER_12]: And in this case, sometimes that category is what's just an easy definition that we know how it should be improved and let's improve it.

1212
02:00:52,295 --> 02:00:56,739
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think that we have some kind of outstanding items from this list where it just needs a little more feedback.

1213
02:00:56,779 --> 02:00:58,040
[SPEAKER_12]: It just needs a little more research.

1214
02:00:58,620 --> 02:00:59,461
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's bundle those.

1215
02:00:59,521 --> 02:01:07,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's get all of the ones that we kind of flagged this week is still under review, or there's like a little bit more that we need to think about here, but it's mostly bite-sized.

1216
02:01:08,428 --> 02:01:17,076
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's plan to come back on the 22nd, review that language, have it ready to go, and be able to refer it out to the council so we can begin that process.

1217
02:01:19,275 --> 02:01:25,839
[SPEAKER_12]: household conversation, the thing where it's more of an interrogation of what do we really want here, and a lot of coverage.

1218
02:01:26,279 --> 02:01:38,186
[SPEAKER_12]: I am very happy to support, you know, making that its own mini package for later in the process and not coming up the works on the easier definitions with those more substantive conversations.

1219
02:01:41,448 --> 02:01:44,510
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I would just throw into, I think like maybe by the end of June,

1220
02:01:47,165 --> 02:01:59,530
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of us, maybe, I don't know, some combination of all of us, I think we'll come up with kind of like taking everything that's in the long A and B lists and maybe we can start kind of putting them into like project-based groupings.

1221
02:01:59,890 --> 02:02:06,073
[SPEAKER_05]: I know some of them are already, some of them I think are still a little bit split out, but like I think we've identified two tonight.

1222
02:02:06,994 --> 02:02:09,516
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe I'd have to go back and look to see if we've already identified them.

1223
02:02:09,556 --> 02:02:16,181
[SPEAKER_05]: But we've added the law coverage definition to the dimensional question, which is definitely a question we want to answer.

1224
02:02:16,701 --> 02:02:28,170
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I think we've kind of come up with this question of how do people live in different formations of people living in different styles of housing, which I don't know that we really had before.

1225
02:02:28,250 --> 02:02:30,852
[SPEAKER_05]: So that might be another kind of grouping.

1226
02:02:32,213 --> 02:02:34,235
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's how I was trying to think about it when we came up

1227
02:02:36,907 --> 02:02:47,535
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just trying to think about like the topics, you know, under each topic maybe there's like a project type.

1228
02:02:47,715 --> 02:02:47,896
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

1229
02:03:06,574 --> 02:03:10,736
[SPEAKER_12]: So any last comments on that?

1230
02:03:10,756 --> 02:03:10,976
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

1231
02:03:11,736 --> 02:03:13,697
[SPEAKER_12]: So we have our next steps on the definitions.

1232
02:03:14,097 --> 02:03:18,718
[SPEAKER_12]: We know that when we vote out the definitions, we will also vote out the table of uses, because that is essentially ready to go.

1233
02:03:22,180 --> 02:03:31,003
[SPEAKER_12]: And just to kind of tie up on the things that we're expecting for next time, also site plan review.

1234
02:03:31,903 --> 02:03:34,664
[SPEAKER_12]: I would love a status update on inclusionary zoning.

1235
02:03:36,053 --> 02:03:39,835
[SPEAKER_12]: kind of a first look at ADUs, possibly the mapping analysis work plan.

1236
02:03:41,036 --> 02:03:51,101
[SPEAKER_12]: Does that, just before we move on to kind of a first review of the policies from the Climate Action Plan, does that encapsulate what we're expecting for the 22nd definitions, table review, site plan review?

1237
02:03:52,742 --> 02:03:56,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Do we feel that the GIS zoning map is possible to have two weeks?

1238
02:03:57,956 --> 02:04:03,600
[SPEAKER_00]: So to have the studies that we would like to do on GIS, is that?

1239
02:04:03,800 --> 02:04:07,723
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the existing map as an electronic version, yes.

1240
02:04:08,464 --> 02:04:17,490
[SPEAKER_01]: We've asked, the last space piece of it was that the colors needed to be updated because there are semi-standard colors to be used.

1241
02:04:17,650 --> 02:04:21,213
[SPEAKER_01]: So the colors that were used in the draft version, we've asked to be updated.

1242
02:04:22,233 --> 02:04:31,415
[SPEAKER_01]: And so since that's the only thing that's left, I think I feel confident in saying that we will ask our GIS coordinator to have a final version of it available.

1243
02:04:31,955 --> 02:04:41,697
[SPEAKER_01]: So the current, we could provide you a version with it this week that just saying that the colors are going to change, but nothing else.

1244
02:04:42,237 --> 02:04:49,259
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when it comes to the council to be referred to the CD board, it would be with the final version of colors.

1245
02:04:49,810 --> 02:04:49,950
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1246
02:04:50,210 --> 02:04:50,370
[SPEAKER_05]: Great.

1247
02:04:50,671 --> 02:04:51,291
[SPEAKER_05]: So that makes sense.

1248
02:04:51,431 --> 02:04:52,052
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds right.

1249
02:04:52,152 --> 02:05:17,692
[SPEAKER_05]: So just I just want to make sure that kind of package, and this is the stuff we want to pass before we want to report out from the 22nd to the 28th meeting so that an ad will do all the advertising so that CD board can hear it and then we can start a hearing on the 25th of June is all these definitions minus the questions around household and the question around lot coverage, site plan review, draft.

1250
02:05:19,008 --> 02:05:22,489
[SPEAKER_05]: the table of use and the map with the updated colors.

1251
02:05:25,150 --> 02:05:25,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you.

1252
02:05:25,970 --> 02:05:27,431
[SPEAKER_01]: Were there additional things?

1253
02:05:27,611 --> 02:05:31,432
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there were some additional things you were planning to bring in two weeks to this meeting.

1254
02:05:31,752 --> 02:05:34,373
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think Councilor Collins was talking about, so I wanted to separate that out.

1255
02:05:34,433 --> 02:05:39,155
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's like, that's the package that we're... That's the package that we're hoping to have in hand on the 22nd.

1256
02:05:41,354 --> 02:05:46,716
[SPEAKER_12]: full comprehensive draft language or visuals, as the case may be, so that we can vote it out on the 22nd.

1257
02:05:46,796 --> 02:05:52,178
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I think there's some additional topics that we're going to be talking about for perhaps the first time, but not voting out.

1258
02:05:52,898 --> 02:05:59,760
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first bucket of things that we're hoping to be able to- Because there were a few things that I was hoping that we would take care of this summer.

1259
02:06:02,116 --> 02:06:04,478
[SPEAKER_01]: that we haven't brought forward yet.

1260
02:06:04,778 --> 02:06:05,018
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1261
02:06:05,078 --> 02:06:07,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's package one.

1262
02:06:07,319 --> 02:06:12,222
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you just mentioned some ADU-related, climate-related, inclusionary-related.

1263
02:06:13,383 --> 02:06:18,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Starting with that on the 22nd, we then have two June meetings to workshop that.

1264
02:06:18,727 --> 02:06:25,591
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe we, at the second or third one, are talking about a second package that we could consider over the summer.

1265
02:06:26,271 --> 02:06:26,511
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

1266
02:06:26,632 --> 02:06:28,193
[SPEAKER_01]: The stuff around the Dover uses?

1267
02:06:29,718 --> 02:06:33,479
[SPEAKER_01]: We needed the final language on that and government zoning.

1268
02:06:34,119 --> 02:06:37,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that part of the site plan review, the Dover piece?

1269
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:39,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.

1270
02:06:40,780 --> 02:06:43,181
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dover was under the site plan review.

1271
02:06:43,481 --> 02:06:43,961
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1272
02:06:44,001 --> 02:06:46,741
[SPEAKER_00]: And the government use.

1273
02:06:47,341 --> 02:06:48,341
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the exception.

1274
02:06:48,481 --> 02:06:49,482
[SPEAKER_06]: That's site plan as well.

1275
02:06:50,982 --> 02:06:52,022
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1276
02:06:52,062 --> 02:06:52,482
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1277
02:06:52,622 --> 02:06:53,542
[SPEAKER_12]: Sorry, I didn't catch that.

1278
02:06:53,602 --> 02:06:54,543
[SPEAKER_06]: That was site plan as well.

1279
02:06:54,723 --> 02:06:55,123
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, great.

1280
02:06:55,523 --> 02:06:56,063
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it feeling...

1281
02:06:58,499 --> 02:07:04,063
[SPEAKER_12]: Is it still realistic to expect proposable language for site plan review in Dover on the 22nd?

1282
02:07:08,407 --> 02:07:10,989
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a Jonathan question or an Ines question?

1283
02:07:13,971 --> 02:07:22,958
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think site plan review, at least for municipal uses, is something that I was going to be looking at.

1284
02:07:23,038 --> 02:07:24,039
[SPEAKER_06]: And I could have something.

1285
02:07:25,925 --> 02:07:28,547
[SPEAKER_06]: on that, a proposal on that, certainly.

1286
02:07:29,807 --> 02:07:46,137
[SPEAKER_06]: More largely on Dover issues, I think, as I recall, the main issue was clarifying that smaller Dover projects didn't need to go through the whole site plan review process, so I could have that prepared as well.

1287
02:07:47,390 --> 02:07:48,931
[SPEAKER_01]: actually, maybe I should clarify this.

1288
02:07:49,231 --> 02:08:10,019
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need a definition of government use for municipal property so that we can put it in the use table and say that the problem is that we want to allow exempt government or municipal, not state or federal, but municipal buildings of all sizes from the zoning rules?

1289
02:08:10,967 --> 02:08:18,252
[SPEAKER_01]: that we required to go to site plan review, but not required like they would like to be very blunt.

1290
02:08:18,453 --> 02:08:27,379
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fire station would never go to the zoning board of appeals for variances, but it would go to the community development board for site plan review.

1291
02:08:29,341 --> 02:08:31,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, yeah, that is consistent with

1292
02:08:33,402 --> 02:08:42,247
[SPEAKER_06]: with what I was anticipating drafting, whether you think it needs to be a separate use in the table of uses.

1293
02:08:43,928 --> 02:08:58,895
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe let's put a pin in that one until you see the language I draft, because I have some rough sketches out of what I'm thinking, and I'm not sure that's necessary, but obviously we can have that conversation when you've seen what I'm going to propose.

1294
02:08:59,926 --> 02:09:01,967
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a use, right?

1295
02:09:05,129 --> 02:09:14,075
[SPEAKER_05]: We have an other municipal uses, use eight under community uses on the use table and it is a yes by right in all districts.

1296
02:09:15,416 --> 02:09:23,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, so I guess- Right, but the problem with that is it doesn't give the city flexibility from dimensional relief.

1297
02:09:23,982 --> 02:09:26,824
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only a use allowance.

1298
02:09:27,765 --> 02:09:29,226
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I understand Alicia's

1299
02:09:30,882 --> 02:09:34,484
[SPEAKER_06]: concern is she doesn't want the city having to go in and apply for variances.

1300
02:09:35,324 --> 02:09:48,069
[SPEAKER_06]: She wants the city to not have to worry about compliance with dimensional or use provisions but still have sort of some oversight in terms of how a project is accomplished.

1301
02:09:49,910 --> 02:09:50,630
[SPEAKER_05]: And I agree with that.

1302
02:09:50,710 --> 02:09:59,814
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just just pointing that out and honestly it might be worth consolidating the public fire station public library and other municipal uses into or if

1303
02:10:01,089 --> 02:10:02,809
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe with what you're writing, we can exempt them.

1304
02:10:02,869 --> 02:10:03,710
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1305
02:10:03,930 --> 02:10:06,110
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm just saying those are in there.

1306
02:10:06,990 --> 02:10:07,891
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that they're useful.

1307
02:10:07,931 --> 02:10:10,791
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know that the parking code and the loading code are really meaningful.

1308
02:10:13,052 --> 02:10:16,493
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm certain that it narrows the flexibility of the city, so.

1309
02:10:16,533 --> 02:10:17,913
[SPEAKER_01]: It really does.

1310
02:10:19,094 --> 02:10:28,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm just very interested in getting that moved forward as quickly as reasonable, because we have projects coming up quickly.

1311
02:10:31,977 --> 02:10:36,279
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I can definitely get something before I'm done for the next meeting.

1312
02:10:38,781 --> 02:10:38,981
[SPEAKER_12]: Great.

1313
02:10:39,241 --> 02:10:39,601
[SPEAKER_12]: Certainly.

1314
02:10:39,681 --> 02:10:40,062
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1315
02:10:40,122 --> 02:10:45,705
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, in general, there's clearly a compelling reason for moving that forward quickly.

1316
02:10:45,745 --> 02:10:59,333
[SPEAKER_12]: And I feel that my role in this process is to be trying to, everything that we know what our intent is, we know what our goals are, we have a reasonable expectation of what our stumbling blocks are, I would like to see move through as quickly as possible because we have such an ambitious work plan.

1317
02:10:59,893 --> 02:11:01,614
[SPEAKER_12]: So for things like site plan review,

1318
02:11:02,866 --> 02:11:05,607
[SPEAKER_12]: the use table, the definitions where we kind of know what we're after.

1319
02:11:06,827 --> 02:11:22,430
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it's great to be able to see that, you know, kind of complete proposed language in two weeks' time so that we can get the ball rolling on that and then proceed on towards our many large and more complicated projects under this ordinance.

1320
02:11:25,190 --> 02:11:30,751
[SPEAKER_12]: So just to recap for next meeting, that's the use table, all definitions except for the two that we decided to separate out.

1321
02:11:31,633 --> 02:11:39,114
[SPEAKER_12]: existing map digitized site plan review, including Dover, adding the definition or, you know, including the definition of government use.

1322
02:11:41,575 --> 02:11:48,456
[SPEAKER_12]: I know for this meeting we also intended to review strategies from the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan.

1323
02:11:49,596 --> 02:11:58,418
[SPEAKER_12]: I also know that it's 8.15 and Councilor Callahan has had to depart and I know that this is an area of interest for her.

1324
02:11:59,518 --> 02:12:00,958
[SPEAKER_12]: What was that?

1325
02:12:05,148 --> 02:12:11,610
[SPEAKER_12]: So maybe there is a... I wonder if there's a middle path here.

1326
02:12:11,631 --> 02:12:28,857
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that thinking about what we're hoping to report out at our next meeting and the topics that we were hoping to raise for the first time between this meeting and next meeting, that being the climate action policies and inclusionary zoning, ADUs, the mapping analysis work plan.

1327
02:12:29,698 --> 02:12:32,659
[SPEAKER_12]: That's kind of like four new buckets that we were hoping to propose between tonight

1328
02:12:33,232 --> 02:12:33,652
[SPEAKER_12]: next time.

1329
02:12:33,672 --> 02:12:45,100
[SPEAKER_12]: I love an ambitious timeline, but I'm not sure what we would get out of it.

1330
02:12:46,221 --> 02:12:52,585
[SPEAKER_12]: Having looked through the packet, there are a lot of climate-related policies suggested in the Climate Action Adaptation Plan.

1331
02:12:52,705 --> 02:12:59,410
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously that's what it is, and I think maybe it's worth rethinking when to have that conversation so that we can

1332
02:13:00,140 --> 02:13:05,081
[SPEAKER_12]: report out some actionable items given that we've been meeting for a couple of hours already.

1333
02:13:10,462 --> 02:13:28,566
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that a priority for me, I want to make sure that we do start having that conversation of what from the cap are we prioritizing and what's going where certainly in May so that that can be informing our discussion of like what big topics are we diving into after our kind of June 30th deadline for our first bucket.

1334
02:13:32,239 --> 02:13:43,774
[SPEAKER_12]: So if we're actually, Paola, I took you off of screen sharing because we were just discussing, but if you wouldn't mind pulling up that, I think it was just one of the very first slides again that lays out our timeline for the rest of May and June.

1335
02:13:43,794 --> 02:13:44,715
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that possible?

1336
02:13:46,057 --> 02:13:48,000
[SPEAKER_01]: If I might, the other thing is that

1337
02:13:49,187 --> 02:13:52,208
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be for lack of a better term homework.

1338
02:13:52,848 --> 02:14:05,433
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the attachments on the agenda was this one page cap review and it sort of lays out the what are the actions the climate plan and what are the sections of zoning that already address that.

1339
02:14:06,033 --> 02:14:14,736
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's actually the slide you might be talking about, and that people might want to just review that and see like, oh, we already are talking about these things.

1340
02:14:15,456 --> 02:14:22,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there pieces of this that you feel are not being covered by the things that are already in the conversation list?

1341
02:14:23,399 --> 02:14:25,460
[SPEAKER_01]: And should we be bumping those out as well?

1342
02:14:27,740 --> 02:14:30,101
[SPEAKER_12]: What in zoning is already in our memo?

1343
02:14:30,982 --> 02:14:34,963
[SPEAKER_12]: And then comparing that to the large list of policies suggested in the cap,

1344
02:14:37,597 --> 02:14:51,908
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this, what we present here is that we took all of the strategies from the Climate Action Adaptation Plan that are related with zoning somehow.

1345
02:14:52,748 --> 02:14:57,052
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we did is where those changes

1346
02:14:58,169 --> 02:15:07,733
[SPEAKER_00]: should be addressed, in which sections of the zoning these strategies would take place.

1347
02:15:09,214 --> 02:15:14,496
[SPEAKER_00]: As of now, not all of these are in zoning.

1348
02:15:14,856 --> 02:15:17,257
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the sections where they would go.

1349
02:15:20,399 --> 02:15:36,670
[SPEAKER_00]: And our ideas, some of them are, when I say transversal topic, is that it's something that will be affecting the whole document, and through the whole document we have to see where this strategy is going to be addressed.

1350
02:15:38,905 --> 02:15:47,114
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of things that, for example, that are one of it in transportation is bike parking regulations.

1351
02:15:47,674 --> 02:15:50,537
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that we are going to add to the table of use.

1352
02:15:51,201 --> 02:15:55,183
[SPEAKER_00]: a new bike parking, and not only for cars.

1353
02:15:56,644 --> 02:16:12,692
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we did is to put all these things, all these strategies that have something to do with zoning, where in which sections we will see them, and where have to be addressed, and which subsections.

1354
02:16:13,452 --> 02:16:15,693
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you see in those tables.

1355
02:16:18,695 --> 02:16:20,536
[SPEAKER_00]: What we want to do now is to

1356
02:16:21,701 --> 02:16:42,279
[SPEAKER_00]: see exactly what you said, Chair Collins, is to address which of these are our priority, which ones are easy changes, fast changes, which ones do need further studies, and that is for the next meeting that will be addressed.

1357
02:16:42,900 --> 02:16:43,560
[SPEAKER_00]: We also would

1358
02:16:45,542 --> 02:16:54,227
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust and make a new memorandum to address all these strategies into our proposed changes.

1359
02:16:55,427 --> 02:16:55,807
[SPEAKER_12]: Certainly.

1360
02:16:56,228 --> 02:16:56,568
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

1361
02:16:56,588 --> 02:16:58,069
[SPEAKER_12]: Appreciate that overview.

1362
02:17:00,810 --> 02:17:14,077
[SPEAKER_12]: Given that, I'm looking at an even earlier slide, the timeline for our upcoming collaborations in this committee with you and the team, and just thinking about where it makes sense to have that discussion.

1363
02:17:15,092 --> 02:17:15,593
[SPEAKER_12]: it makes sense.

1364
02:17:15,613 --> 02:17:24,979
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we'll have a more productive conversation coming and having sifted what's already in the work plan, what's already in the works, and what's left out that should be added to the list of priorities.

1365
02:17:26,701 --> 02:17:33,045
[SPEAKER_12]: So would you mind pulling up the timeline so we're... I think it's like slide number two.

1366
02:17:37,008 --> 02:17:40,651
[SPEAKER_12]: Just in terms of where to have this discussion most effectively.

1367
02:17:41,372 --> 02:17:41,572
[SPEAKER_12]: So

1368
02:17:42,315 --> 02:17:43,716
[SPEAKER_12]: We're at May 8 right now.

1369
02:17:43,816 --> 02:17:54,801
[SPEAKER_12]: May 22, we're going to look at and report out definitions, use table, digital map, site plan review, including Dover language.

1370
02:17:57,603 --> 02:18:04,866
[SPEAKER_12]: And we have, I think, three new topics to surface at that meeting as well, between mapping analysis, inclusionary zoning, and ADUs.

1371
02:18:05,346 --> 02:18:10,149
[SPEAKER_12]: I wonder if it makes sense to give all these topics a little bit of breathing room, maybe

1372
02:18:11,038 --> 02:18:20,360
[SPEAKER_12]: Our June 12th committee meeting can be revisiting those three topics brought up for the first time, May 22nd, after we report out everything that we've already spoken about tonight.

1373
02:18:20,980 --> 02:18:32,262
[SPEAKER_12]: And June 12th can be kind of a first attempt, our first conversation about surfacing priorities from the climate policies and making sure that those are added to the work plan.

1374
02:18:32,702 --> 02:18:37,022
[SPEAKER_12]: Just in terms of sort of revising our next steps in the flow of these meetings.

1375
02:18:40,083 --> 02:18:40,903
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that makes sense.

1376
02:18:40,923 --> 02:18:56,012
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think also, I think it would be useful for us to take everything that's in the climate plan sheet and basically say, OK, these ones are CR, climate resiliency.

1377
02:18:56,032 --> 02:18:57,633
[SPEAKER_05]: These ones are HP, housing production.

1378
02:18:57,693 --> 02:19:00,655
[SPEAKER_05]: These ones are, and put them into the topics that may also be worth it.

1379
02:19:00,715 --> 02:19:04,477
[SPEAKER_05]: And I keep asking you to reformat this.

1380
02:19:04,797 --> 02:19:05,938
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm actually happy to help.

1381
02:19:05,978 --> 02:19:08,019
[SPEAKER_05]: But maybe if I have a second.

1382
02:19:08,717 --> 02:19:09,658
[SPEAKER_05]: can put a framework in.

1383
02:19:09,758 --> 02:19:28,528
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I think that these topics should be considered areas where any specific change or idea goes to a specific topic, and then we can consider the topics discreetly, rather than having different pieces of different topics being discussed at different meetings, because I think we're just going to start getting really confused.

1384
02:19:29,328 --> 02:19:30,049
[SPEAKER_05]: about that.

1385
02:19:30,289 --> 02:19:32,310
[SPEAKER_05]: So like, I think it's useful.

1386
02:19:32,370 --> 02:19:39,635
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what we're doing now, it's saying, let's sort all of the zoning related plan recommendations into topics is a valuable thing to do.

1387
02:19:39,655 --> 02:19:53,165
[SPEAKER_05]: I think once we've done that, we should not be having like a climate plan related meeting, but then going to say, okay, let's look at everything from the climate plan, the comp plan and any other plan that went to the climate resiliency bucket.

1388
02:19:53,265 --> 02:19:54,666
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're having a meeting on that bucket.

1389
02:19:55,466 --> 02:19:57,988
[SPEAKER_05]: And like, I think tonight we have

1390
02:19:58,963 --> 02:20:03,344
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, the block coverage definition is definitely going to this UDR bucket.

1391
02:20:03,845 --> 02:20:25,371
[SPEAKER_05]: So it might even be worth like now that we have the phase one phase two, it might even be worth being like, we have a, you know, labeling them as like a CR one, a CR two, or some, that might not be the best number for each item, but also sorting, sorting each like idea by phase and then by topic bucket.

1392
02:20:25,851 --> 02:20:28,252
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, cause then probably,

1393
02:20:29,215 --> 02:20:39,363
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe even later in June or certainly after June, we can start having conversations about each specific topic bucket area.

1394
02:20:40,504 --> 02:20:47,929
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe we could spend some time in June also taking the comp plan and sorting that out into the buckets.

1395
02:20:48,690 --> 02:20:54,774
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also just want to flag that I think there are probably one or two maybe new

1396
02:20:57,870 --> 02:21:18,855
[SPEAKER_05]: new buckets or buckets that we didn't consider and I'm just seeing it going through how much of this is like definitions process and format like maybe there should just be like a general a topic that's just like general or legal definitions format and then maybe there should be a topic that's very explicitly about like

1397
02:21:20,384 --> 02:21:21,625
[SPEAKER_05]: permitting and process.

1398
02:21:22,725 --> 02:21:24,426
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause those just seem to be two things that are missing.

1399
02:21:24,506 --> 02:21:32,769
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I don't know exactly where our discussion about this type of the housing, how people, different people like with the different ways that people live.

1400
02:21:32,909 --> 02:21:34,550
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know what bucket I'd put that, put that in.

1401
02:21:34,590 --> 02:21:35,830
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it could be housing production.

1402
02:21:35,850 --> 02:21:37,171
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe it could be housing affordability.

1403
02:21:38,091 --> 02:21:39,972
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think it's worth, it's all an entire topic area.

1404
02:21:39,992 --> 02:21:46,255
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I do think it's pretty, you know, specific, but, but that would just be a way for me.

1405
02:21:46,395 --> 02:21:48,676
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause I think like we keep kind of getting,

1406
02:21:49,775 --> 02:21:51,116
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's growing pains of learning.

1407
02:21:51,156 --> 02:21:55,859
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're figuring out how to do a very, very ambitious thing and talk about 25 million things.

1408
02:21:56,520 --> 02:21:57,801
[SPEAKER_05]: How do we do that in an orderly way?

1409
02:21:58,601 --> 02:22:03,065
[SPEAKER_05]: It just seems like we're going down different paths and threads.

1410
02:22:03,105 --> 02:22:08,068
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think just having even clearer, taking what we've already developed and making it slightly clearer.

1411
02:22:08,989 --> 02:22:11,651
[SPEAKER_05]: If we have an idea, it goes into a topic-based bucket.

1412
02:22:11,711 --> 02:22:13,492
[SPEAKER_05]: When we get to that, that's when we'll talk about it.

1413
02:22:13,512 --> 02:22:18,335
[SPEAKER_05]: It will help us to make sure that everything we want to get done gets done.

1414
02:22:19,966 --> 02:22:20,326
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.

1415
02:22:20,346 --> 02:22:23,970
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think in these meetings, we've been kind of trending there organically.

1416
02:22:23,990 --> 02:22:32,518
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think, you know, to the extent that we can absolutely, I think to see the extent that we can plan for that, we'll just, we're already picking up momentum as we go along.

1417
02:22:32,538 --> 02:22:35,601
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think planning for that will help.

1418
02:22:35,661 --> 02:22:42,287
[SPEAKER_12]: I think ideally, you know, we obviously from the outset, we've been aligned in the goal of passing like things at the same time.

1419
02:22:42,547 --> 02:22:43,108
[SPEAKER_12]: And so I think

1420
02:22:43,803 --> 02:22:44,943
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, that's kind of procedural.

1421
02:22:44,963 --> 02:22:46,864
[SPEAKER_12]: We're talking about definitions, we're talking about tables.

1422
02:22:47,324 --> 02:22:49,604
[SPEAKER_12]: And then as we get past June, that'll be around goals.

1423
02:22:50,425 --> 02:22:51,605
[SPEAKER_12]: And so aligning things by goal.

1424
02:22:51,725 --> 02:23:02,908
[SPEAKER_12]: And we can have a couple meetings in June, I think, to go through the climate plan and the comp plan to build on the work that you've already been doing with the memos to make sure that those are aligned by outcome and goal.

1425
02:23:03,068 --> 02:23:07,069
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we can just meet by topic over the summer and into the fall.

1426
02:23:07,589 --> 02:23:07,789
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1427
02:23:07,849 --> 02:23:11,790
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do want to point out kind of what you said about what you said, you said ADUs,

1428
02:23:12,699 --> 02:23:16,182
[SPEAKER_12]: Inclusionary, ADUs, and I think the mapping analysis is the other piece.

1429
02:23:16,962 --> 02:23:17,142
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

1430
02:23:17,283 --> 02:23:33,335
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, like, to be honest, I think we should take the mapping and put it in the mapping district's bucket, take the ADUs, put it in the housing production bucket, take inclusionary, put it in the housing affordability bucket, and then do that rather than necessarily front-loading.

1431
02:23:33,735 --> 02:23:34,496
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.

1432
02:23:34,936 --> 02:23:37,958
[SPEAKER_05]: But I also think, like, right now we're kind of still in almost

1433
02:23:42,168 --> 02:23:56,639
[SPEAKER_05]: I think through June 30th we're in the phase of what are the quick things that we can do and then how are we still structuring the format of this process so that all the other things and ideas that we come up with happen between July 1 and whenever we finish up in 2025, that that happens in an orderly way.

1434
02:23:57,880 --> 02:24:04,486
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't necessarily think we have to go entirely sequentially, like we can't do X until we've done Y, but I do think

1435
02:24:05,441 --> 02:24:19,129
[SPEAKER_05]: the more that a meeting could be like, we could say we're having two meetings on all the housing production ideas and then get that out of the way versus having like one housing affordability topic and one housing production topic and one climate resiliency topic in a single meeting.

1436
02:24:19,189 --> 02:24:22,091
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think that's going to end up getting, we're going to get less done.

1437
02:24:22,531 --> 02:24:24,492
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, no, I completely agree.

1438
02:24:25,233 --> 02:24:31,416
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think maybe between, uh, we know what we're doing in terms of the things we're going to report out at our next meeting and maybe between now and then, um,

1439
02:24:32,898 --> 02:24:36,379
[SPEAKER_12]: we and staff and NS can be talking about for the second half of that meeting.

1440
02:24:36,399 --> 02:24:36,900
[SPEAKER_12]: What makes sense?

1441
02:24:36,920 --> 02:24:39,401
[SPEAKER_12]: Should we keep inclusionary ADUs, mapping analysis?

1442
02:24:39,941 --> 02:24:40,741
[SPEAKER_12]: Are we teed up for that?

1443
02:24:40,781 --> 02:24:41,321
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that easy?

1444
02:24:41,482 --> 02:24:52,446
[SPEAKER_12]: Or should we shift to going over one of the, like having the climate plan conversation that we didn't have tonight, the second half of that meeting instead, or the comp plan.

1445
02:24:52,846 --> 02:24:56,928
[SPEAKER_12]: And then so that we are moving things into those sequences, into those folders.

1446
02:24:59,500 --> 02:25:01,663
[SPEAKER_12]: But that's not, I'm not putting, you don't have to answer the question right now.

1447
02:25:01,703 --> 02:25:05,848
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's just maybe something for us to consider as we're developing the agenda for two weeks from now.

1448
02:25:06,108 --> 02:25:07,590
[SPEAKER_12]: We already have a great sled of work though.

1449
02:25:08,471 --> 02:25:10,954
[SPEAKER_12]: We are going to be reporting out of that meeting and that's a great start.

1450
02:25:10,994 --> 02:25:17,963
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we can just be thinking about as we're sort of closing a door and opening a door in every meeting, what's the door that we want to open at that meeting?

1451
02:25:19,318 --> 02:25:31,441
[SPEAKER_05]: And just for me, if by June 30th, all that we had done was this package that we just agreed to, and we had reviewed the major plans and put all of the different zoning related items into their specific buckets.

1452
02:25:32,051 --> 02:25:34,333
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had said, these are the buckets, it's the final list.

1453
02:25:34,853 --> 02:25:38,195
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe we'd started to calendar out when we're going to take up specific things.

1454
02:25:38,755 --> 02:25:39,636
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be fine with that.

1455
02:25:40,116 --> 02:25:48,261
[SPEAKER_05]: If there are PDS priorities of things we want to get done over the summer or discrete things that we don't want to refer into those buckets and take sequentially, I'm fine with that too.

1456
02:25:48,382 --> 02:25:50,183
[SPEAKER_05]: But I do think we should try to

1457
02:25:51,468 --> 02:26:06,240
[SPEAKER_05]: limit that, not have that be our process, but have it be kind of exceptions to the process because of things that we want to fast track, but have most things fall into just because I'm starting to get brainwashed on what we're doing.

1458
02:26:06,420 --> 02:26:10,023
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm thinking about it a lot, obviously.

1459
02:26:12,965 --> 02:26:17,309
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, no, I think that that, um, I think that will work well.

1460
02:26:20,674 --> 02:26:31,603
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much for truly co-creating this process with us as you are helping us with our zoning process and the outcomes.

1461
02:26:32,624 --> 02:26:37,608
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that leaves us with a great plan for next time, certainly a decent amount of work.

1462
02:26:37,728 --> 02:26:39,189
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you in advance.

1463
02:26:41,931 --> 02:26:46,275
[SPEAKER_12]: Excited to get the ball rolling on our first zoning votes to come in this process.

1464
02:26:46,295 --> 02:26:47,136
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that's pretty exciting.

1465
02:26:52,125 --> 02:26:59,408
[SPEAKER_12]: I think we're pretty well set on our next steps and pieces that we're looking to Innis for, for our next meeting.

1466
02:26:59,528 --> 02:27:05,730
[SPEAKER_12]: Are there any final comments or motions from Councilors other than what we've already discussed?

1467
02:27:11,852 --> 02:27:13,173
[SPEAKER_12]: Seeing none, just want to thank you again.

1468
02:27:13,193 --> 02:27:14,713
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you so much, Paola.

1469
02:27:14,933 --> 02:27:17,434
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, Director Hunt, for being here and to the Innis team.

1470
02:27:17,454 --> 02:27:19,675
[SPEAKER_12]: I know there's a lot of work being done behind the scenes.

1471
02:27:20,359 --> 02:27:22,159
[SPEAKER_12]: on the city side and the inner side all the time.

1472
02:27:22,439 --> 02:27:23,200
[SPEAKER_12]: Very much appreciated.

1473
02:27:23,220 --> 02:27:26,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Is there a motion to adjourn?

1474
02:27:26,360 --> 02:27:27,060
[SPEAKER_07]: Motion to adjourn.

1475
02:27:28,060 --> 02:27:28,400
[SPEAKER_12]: Second.

1476
02:27:28,941 --> 02:27:30,081
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep the paper in committee and adjourn.

1477
02:27:30,361 --> 02:27:30,521
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1478
02:27:33,521 --> 02:27:38,962
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion to keep the paper in committee and adjourn by Councilor Leming, seconded by President Barras.

1479
02:27:40,163 --> 02:27:40,843
[SPEAKER_12]: All those in favor?

1480
02:27:41,063 --> 02:27:41,183
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

1481
02:27:41,283 --> 02:27:41,623
[SPEAKER_12]: Aye.

1482
02:27:41,983 --> 02:27:42,843
[SPEAKER_12]: All those opposed?

1483
02:27:43,583 --> 02:27:44,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Meeting is adjourned.

1484
02:27:46,404 --> 02:27:47,724
[SPEAKER_12]: Motion passes and the meeting is adjourned.
