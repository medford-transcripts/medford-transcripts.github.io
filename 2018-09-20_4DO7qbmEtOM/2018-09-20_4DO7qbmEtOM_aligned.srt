1
00:00:13,756 --> 00:00:14,777
And now we've got to figure out where.

2
00:00:16,038 --> 00:00:27,546
OK, page 3 in the new notes, second paragraph down, it says that the compressors were $50,000 per compressor.

3
00:00:27,566 --> 00:00:28,987
The number is 15.

4
00:00:33,151 --> 00:00:37,754
Motion to amend the minutes to be $15,000 per compressor on page 3 of the notes.

5
00:00:38,575 --> 00:00:39,475
It's in a couple of places.

6
00:00:42,163 --> 00:00:43,865
Is there a motion for approval as amended?

7
00:00:44,725 --> 00:00:46,967
So moved by Mr. Russo, seconded by Ms.

8
00:00:47,007 --> 00:00:47,688
Mustone.

9
00:00:48,068 --> 00:00:48,829
All those in favor?

10
00:00:49,369 --> 00:00:49,429
Aye.

11
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:50,390
All those opposed?

12
00:00:50,931 --> 00:00:51,671
Motion passes.

13
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:54,814
Approval of bills, transfer of funds.

14
00:00:58,637 --> 00:01:01,820
Motion for approval by Mr. Benedetto, Mr. Russo.

15
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:02,721
Second?

16
00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:04,102
Second by Mr. Russo.

17
00:01:04,142 --> 00:01:04,943
Roll call vote please.

18
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:14,164
Yes.

19
00:01:17,366 --> 00:01:17,606
Yes.

20
00:01:17,867 --> 00:01:19,168
7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

21
00:01:19,188 --> 00:01:20,048
The motion passes.

22
00:01:20,068 --> 00:01:21,229
Approval of payrolls.

23
00:01:23,511 --> 00:01:24,452
Motion for approval by Ms.

24
00:01:24,472 --> 00:01:25,533
Van de Kloet, seconded by Ms.

25
00:01:25,593 --> 00:01:26,153
Benedetto.

26
00:01:26,213 --> 00:01:26,894
Roll call vote, please.

27
00:01:35,844 --> 00:01:36,104
Yes.

28
00:01:39,046 --> 00:01:40,846
Yes, 7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

29
00:01:40,886 --> 00:01:41,587
Motion passes.

30
00:01:41,667 --> 00:01:42,607
Report of secretary.

31
00:01:42,627 --> 00:01:58,534
I wanted to just inform everybody during the summer, I was receiving feedback from both with the yearbook advisor, David Ambrosie.

32
00:01:59,134 --> 00:02:02,015
And there was a couple of students that were working with him.

33
00:02:02,516 --> 00:02:05,518
to implement a supplement package.

34
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:18,707
I'm not sure if some of you are aware, but when the yearbook came out, there were some students that were omitted, and there were some pages that were sections of the yearbook that weren't really advertised a lot.

35
00:02:19,027 --> 00:02:23,110
For example, the Mustang Mall and some of the vocational programs.

36
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:30,135
So over the summer, Dave Ambrosie and a couple of students, which I'll name, worked together

37
00:02:30,545 --> 00:02:32,525
to help put the supplement together.

38
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:41,868
And last Friday, or last Thursday and last Friday, the supplement was mailed to all of the 2018 class of 2018 seniors.

39
00:02:42,408 --> 00:02:45,609
And I brought it in, you know, I can share it and everybody can take a look at it.

40
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:56,071
And I want to give a heartfelt thank you because what David did was he actually hand delivered the yearbook to some families and actually brought it to their house to make sure they got it.

41
00:02:56,571 --> 00:02:58,652
And he's just really, he did a great job

42
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:00,213
We stayed in contact.

43
00:03:00,253 --> 00:03:03,654
He shared some of the proofs with me, and I got to see them before they went to print.

44
00:03:04,235 --> 00:03:19,039
And so I want to thank Dave Ambrosie, some of the students, Mia McGillicuddy, Avro Sequeria, I hope I pronounced it correctly, Carla DeStefano.

45
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,660
And I just wanted to say thank you very much.

46
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:27,602
And one minor update, I know I told everybody in the email communication the slide was

47
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,102
The slide arrived for the Columbus School.

48
00:03:31,143 --> 00:03:37,548
Right now, the Parks Department is working with Game Time because they're trying to fit it into the old slide.

49
00:03:37,868 --> 00:03:41,811
So they have been going back and forth with Game Time to find a solution for the slide.

50
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:49,336
And one last update, and I plan to put this on the agenda coming up for the next meeting.

51
00:03:50,137 --> 00:03:57,502
Over the summer, I mentioned to everybody in another email that the Elks, Memphis Malden Elks had reached out to me

52
00:03:58,105 --> 00:04:17,038
I'm an ALCS member, and they wanted to let us know that they have a program, it's a scholarship program that's gonna be available for fifth, sixth graders, and seventh and eighth graders, where they can write an essay, and it will be a monetary, you know, kind of scholarship, monetary gift that they're gonna be awarded.

53
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:26,504
So I have the packages that I can, you know, maybe give to Superintendent and, you know, Diane Caldwell, but I do think it's a new,

54
00:04:27,621 --> 00:04:29,062
you know, essay scholarship program.

55
00:04:29,082 --> 00:04:33,965
So I think it would have to go on the agenda maybe for the next meeting, but I'm not too sure.

56
00:04:35,986 --> 00:04:36,246
Yeah.

57
00:04:37,007 --> 00:04:41,710
So I can, I can, you know, what I'll do is I'll send an email and maybe hand the packet off tonight.

58
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,130
Okay.

59
00:04:42,562 --> 00:04:45,685
And thank you, Mr. Hutz, for staying connected on that yearbook issue.

60
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:47,606
You really fought hard for those children.

61
00:04:47,667 --> 00:04:48,527
So thank you.

62
00:04:48,627 --> 00:04:49,788
It came out wonderful.

63
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:56,554
Is there a motion to accept the secretary's report and place it on file by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Russo?

64
00:04:56,694 --> 00:04:57,535
All those in favor?

65
00:04:58,296 --> 00:04:58,956
All those opposed?

66
00:04:59,016 --> 00:04:59,737
Motion passes.

67
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:02,740
And I also want to acknowledge that we have a new senior with us tonight.

68
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,244
Chuma Opara will be the school committee representative as well.

69
00:05:07,284 --> 00:05:08,024
So welcome.

70
00:05:11,857 --> 00:05:17,989
And feel free, if you want to pipe in on any topic that arises tonight, just step forward and we'll give you a microphone, okay?

71
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:18,971
Thank you.

72
00:05:20,648 --> 00:05:21,889
All right, report on committees.

73
00:05:22,229 --> 00:05:35,279
We met earlier tonight in Committee of the Whole to discuss a naming right that Erin DiVenedo, school committee member, had put forth to name the band room after prior school committee member, Lena DeJohn Tomaso.

74
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:48,529
She served the City of Medford School Committee for 28 years, and she also volunteered her services at many organizations across the city, including the Friends of the GMAC Jim and Chevalier Auditorium, as well as a host of other

75
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:55,021
non-profits that she served on and was always a very active and vibrant voice on those committees.

76
00:05:55,101 --> 00:06:00,242
So there was a motion for approval in our committee of the whole, but we'd like to adopt the committee report.

77
00:06:00,742 --> 00:06:02,883
Is there a motion to accept the committee report as filed?

78
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:03,103
So moved.

79
00:06:04,443 --> 00:06:05,243
So moved by Ms.

80
00:06:05,303 --> 00:06:07,124
Van de Kloot, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

81
00:06:07,164 --> 00:06:13,025
Roll call vote on naming the band room after a former school committee member, Lina de Jon Tommaso.

82
00:06:13,785 --> 00:06:14,445
Mr. Aguirre.

83
00:06:15,732 --> 00:06:17,253
Is it possible we could also add a plaque?

84
00:06:17,493 --> 00:06:17,993
Yes, oh definitely.

85
00:06:18,013 --> 00:06:19,073
To add some historical context.

86
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:21,614
A plaque would go with it with the story of her.

87
00:06:21,634 --> 00:06:21,974
Thank you.

88
00:06:23,715 --> 00:06:23,935
Ms.

89
00:06:23,955 --> 00:06:24,415
Van de Kloot?

90
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:32,398
I would assume then also we'll get together and figure out some sort of reception that we might have to dedicate the plaque and the room.

91
00:06:32,418 --> 00:06:34,498
Definitely.

92
00:06:34,518 --> 00:06:34,939
Mr. Benedetto?

93
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:41,141
Hey Burke, there was a few community members at our meeting and I want to thank them for coming forward this evening.

94
00:06:41,521 --> 00:06:44,842
We have Councilor Mox here and I just wanted to give him a chance

95
00:06:45,412 --> 00:06:56,339
to say a few words, if he so chose, so the community could hear all the wonderful things that Lena DiGentimaso did in her 28 years of service to our community and our students.

96
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:03,323
He knew her best, one of the best in the community, and would you like to say a few words, if it's okay with?

97
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:04,264
Certainly.

98
00:07:04,484 --> 00:07:04,964
Of course.

99
00:07:05,624 --> 00:07:08,626
Thank you, school committee member DiBenedetto, I appreciate that.

100
00:07:09,046 --> 00:07:11,408
And thank you to the school committee and Madam Mayor.

101
00:07:12,268 --> 00:07:14,770
I had the unique opportunity to serve six years

102
00:07:15,635 --> 00:07:18,756
as a member of the school committee alongside Lena DiGentimasso.

103
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:27,000
And I can tell you unequivocally, she was the most dedicated, hardworking elected official that I've ever served with in this community.

104
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,401
And I've been doing this for a number of years.

105
00:07:30,802 --> 00:07:36,584
Back in January 2018, I offered before the Memphis City Council paper 18-006.

106
00:07:36,764 --> 00:07:42,887
The paper read, to recognize Lena DiGentimasso,

107
00:07:43,354 --> 00:07:47,015
for her 28 years of dedicated service to the children of our community.

108
00:07:47,695 --> 00:07:55,077
It was passed unanimously by the city council and referred to the superintendent of schools and the school committee for further review.

109
00:07:56,017 --> 00:08:00,538
I just would like, Madam Mayor, if you would indulge me just for a few moments.

110
00:08:01,478 --> 00:08:12,661
I appreciate the dialogue that took place in the Committee of the Whole meeting tonight, and many of which current members have never had the opportunity like I had to serve with Lena

111
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:20,097
and you brought up some very valid questions about when and why do we bestow such an honor on someone.

112
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:37,804
And I can just let you know that in my dealings with Lena, she was always straightforward, someone that you can count on, someone that was a person of their word, someone that was loyal to the utmost.

113
00:08:38,785 --> 00:08:41,766
And in her time as a member of the school committee,

114
00:08:42,183 --> 00:08:47,186
She served with distinction for 28 years, but she was also a very active member of the community.

115
00:08:47,806 --> 00:08:56,350
And that's why I think you have to look at someone's total resume, for not better words, when you look to honor someone.

116
00:08:56,810 --> 00:09:00,652
And I just would like to bring up a few things that I was able to dig up over the years.

117
00:09:01,593 --> 00:09:04,514
Lena served for three decades on the Medford School Committee.

118
00:09:05,115 --> 00:09:08,777
She was a strong advocate for the Medford Vocational Technical High School.

119
00:09:09,517 --> 00:09:11,538
She was a strong supporter of the Curtis Tufts

120
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:16,224
alternative high school, a strong supporter of the fine arts department,

121
00:09:17,148 --> 00:09:29,533
and the high school band, of which was mentioned tonight by members of the school committee that back in the 90s when times were very lean, there were a lot of cuts going back and forth.

122
00:09:30,074 --> 00:09:34,976
And I can remember firsthand that the arts were a major cut.

123
00:09:35,596 --> 00:09:45,180
And if it wasn't for Lena and her voice standing up to save the band and many other arts within our school department,

124
00:09:46,404 --> 00:09:48,125
It probably wouldn't have happened, to be quite frank.

125
00:09:49,406 --> 00:09:51,546
Lena was the past president of the Friends of Chevalier.

126
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:54,147
She was instrumental in the building of the new schools.

127
00:09:54,768 --> 00:10:09,694
I had the opportunity, along with Paulette van der Kloot, to actually climb to the roofs of many of our old school buildings, and Lena was the first up the ladder to the roof with her high heels and her dress on and her hair done to a tilt.

128
00:10:11,355 --> 00:10:13,455
And that was the type of person she was.

129
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:14,956
She was dedicated.

130
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:15,833
to the end.

131
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:19,214
I mean, she really lived the job.

132
00:10:20,114 --> 00:10:24,755
And she also served with distinction as the PTA President.

133
00:10:25,315 --> 00:10:33,757
She was selected by the Board of Directors of the Mass Association of School Committees and Corp to receive the Association's Lifetime Achievement Award.

134
00:10:34,538 --> 00:10:37,478
She received the Woman's Achievement Award from the Human Rights Commission.

135
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:44,880
She was the recipient of the Tip of the Hat Award from the Salem Street Business Association, received the Golden Mustang Award

136
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,961
for supporting the students of the Mustang athletic programs.

137
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:52,523
She was instrumental in planning and development of the Gene Mack Youth Center.

138
00:10:53,384 --> 00:11:03,508
She received the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post-1012 Award in appreciation of leading the charge to have the McGlynn School Auditorium named in honor of the veterans.

139
00:11:04,549 --> 00:11:10,192
She was honored by the Curtis Tufts Alternative High School graduation for many years of continued support.

140
00:11:10,812 --> 00:11:13,233
She received the Tony Lucci Golden Mustang Award

141
00:11:13,704 --> 00:11:16,206
for being an outstanding athletic program supporter.

142
00:11:16,787 --> 00:11:20,991
She served as president of the AARP, Meffitt Chapter, 1132.

143
00:11:22,132 --> 00:11:27,737
I'd also be remiss, Madam Mayor, if I didn't mention Lena's late husband.

144
00:11:28,458 --> 00:11:30,660
If you knew Lena, she was always with Alfred.

145
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,262
Wherever you saw her in the city, it was Lena and Alfred.

146
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:39,548
Alfred was a Korean War veteran and a Purple Heart recipient, and also her three children,

147
00:11:40,626 --> 00:11:43,067
all were educated in the Meffitt Public Schools.

148
00:11:44,407 --> 00:11:59,570
So I, too, think this is an honor that's long overdue and worthy of such a dedicated member of this community, not only to the schools and the children, but to the entire population of the city of Meffitt.

149
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:09,312
And I thank you all for your diligence on this, and I look forward to the day when we can call the band room the Lena DiGentimaso Band Room.

150
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:10,474
Thank you very much.

151
00:12:10,494 --> 00:12:10,994
Thank you.

152
00:12:12,595 --> 00:12:15,778
On the motion, as first by Ms.

153
00:12:15,798 --> 00:12:16,998
Vander Kloot, seconded by Ms.

154
00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:19,120
DiVenedetto, roll call vote, please.

155
00:12:29,965 --> 00:12:31,846
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

156
00:12:31,886 --> 00:12:32,646
The motion passes.

157
00:12:32,666 --> 00:12:34,227
The committee report is adopted.

158
00:12:34,727 --> 00:12:37,809
Also, could someone make a motion for suspension of the rules, please?

159
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:38,669
So motioned.

160
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:43,272
Motion for suspension of the rules by Mr. Benedetto to take papers out of order.

161
00:12:44,092 --> 00:12:48,534
We have an item number seven, a recommendation to approve a liquor license for Bistro 489.

162
00:12:50,075 --> 00:12:51,435
in the Medford High School foyer.

163
00:12:51,515 --> 00:12:54,196
These are for two separate events that are scheduled there.

164
00:12:54,536 --> 00:13:00,017
The first is a retirement party for our city clerk, Ed Finn, who retired this past September 11th.

165
00:13:00,477 --> 00:13:08,459
His event is on September 27th at Bistro 49 from 6 to 8, and I believe it was an open invitation from people who just had an RSVP.

166
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:16,080
And the second event is the Taste of Italy, scheduled for October 14th, 2018 in the Medford High School foyer from

167
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,871
It says 2 to 8 p.m.

168
00:13:17,991 --> 00:13:19,191
I don't believe that's the time.

169
00:13:19,311 --> 00:13:21,412
Is it 6 to 8 p.m.?

170
00:13:21,432 --> 00:13:22,353
4 to 8 p.m.

171
00:13:23,773 --> 00:13:25,314
And that is a Kiwana event.

172
00:13:28,496 --> 00:13:29,356
Mr. Benedetto.

173
00:13:29,696 --> 00:13:32,398
Mayor Burke, I motion to approve these items.

174
00:13:33,258 --> 00:13:42,242
I think the new Bistro will get more business if we are careful, but approve these licenses to happen.

175
00:13:42,903 --> 00:13:45,164
I'm sure that any

176
00:13:48,339 --> 00:13:55,982
Any security would be present at the times of these programs being run.

177
00:13:56,242 --> 00:14:02,284
And I look forward to more and more business coming to our bistro, because it's beautiful.

178
00:14:02,364 --> 00:14:05,806
And we invested a lot in that part of our vocational education.

179
00:14:05,846 --> 00:14:11,548
And it gives our students the best opportunity to learn and grow in their trade.

180
00:14:12,214 --> 00:14:14,356
So I make a motion at this time to approve.

181
00:14:14,376 --> 00:14:15,797
There's a motion on the floor for approval.

182
00:14:15,857 --> 00:14:15,997
Ms.

183
00:14:16,017 --> 00:14:16,497
Van de Kloot.

184
00:14:17,098 --> 00:14:26,546
Since we haven't approved many liquor licenses, I just want to understand exactly what the process is, if you could clarify.

185
00:14:27,006 --> 00:14:27,326
Certainly.

186
00:14:27,346 --> 00:14:35,393
The petitioner still has to go through our licensing commission, and they have to apply for a license to have the one-day alcohol permit.

187
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:38,235
So that will still take place with our licensing commission.

188
00:14:38,555 --> 00:14:40,597
They wanted to have it on file that the school committee

189
00:14:41,523 --> 00:14:45,166
accepted and acknowledged that these two events are happening on school property.

190
00:14:45,406 --> 00:14:45,626
OK.

191
00:14:45,827 --> 00:14:46,147
Thank you.

192
00:14:46,707 --> 00:14:47,908
Is there a second on the floor?

193
00:14:48,489 --> 00:14:49,009
I'll second it.

194
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:49,850
Seconded by Ms.

195
00:14:49,870 --> 00:14:50,270
Van de Kloet.

196
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,031
Roll call vote, please.

197
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:52,392
Mr. Van de Kloet, yes.

198
00:14:52,412 --> 00:14:54,874
Mr. Benson, yes.

199
00:14:55,575 --> 00:14:55,855
Mr. Jones, yes.

200
00:14:55,915 --> 00:14:56,195
Mr. Gero, yes.

201
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:56,676
Mr. Houston, yes.

202
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:59,898
Mr. Van de Kloet, yes.

203
00:14:59,958 --> 00:14:59,998
Ms.

204
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:01,720
Van de Kloet, yes.

205
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,041
7 in the affirmative, 0 in the negative.

206
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:03,842
Motion passes.

207
00:15:04,442 --> 00:15:06,584
Is there a motion to revert to the regular order of business?

208
00:15:06,604 --> 00:15:07,044
So moved.

209
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:08,646
Mr. Benedetto.

210
00:15:18,852 --> 00:15:21,336
While we're into suspension, Mr. Benedetto.

211
00:15:23,278 --> 00:15:27,063
The first item is, I saw Jenny Graham here and

212
00:15:27,605 --> 00:15:32,786
The PTOs had a registration form that we created last year, and it's an online form.

213
00:15:33,186 --> 00:15:36,967
And we need to provide training to the PTOs and other organizations.

214
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:42,908
So I know it was an online form, and I'm not sure that the superintendent is aware of it.

215
00:15:43,388 --> 00:15:50,269
And all of those organizations are supposed to register by, I can't remember if it was October 1st or mid-October.

216
00:15:50,729 --> 00:15:52,410
And since that is very soon,

217
00:15:54,035 --> 00:15:58,238
I didn't know if Jenny could come up and just refresh our mind about what she presented.

218
00:15:58,579 --> 00:16:07,986
I remember being very impressed with the online form and how we were going about it, and exactly which groups are responsible for filling them out.

219
00:16:09,327 --> 00:16:10,408
I didn't remember everything.

220
00:16:10,448 --> 00:16:11,248
Name and address, please.

221
00:16:11,789 --> 00:16:13,210
Jenny Graham, 7 Ronalee Road.

222
00:16:14,471 --> 00:16:16,192
So back in the spring, we were

223
00:16:18,017 --> 00:16:26,461
talking about PTO transparency, among other things, and really any sort of friends of group that works on behalf of Medford Public Schools.

224
00:16:27,021 --> 00:16:37,025
So we drafted some guidelines around what kind of information PTOs should be sharing with the school committee via the superintendent's office.

225
00:16:37,865 --> 00:16:40,547
And at that time, we had like a couple of

226
00:16:41,782 --> 00:16:48,984
Committee of the Whole meetings where we worked with various members of PTOs across a number of the schools to build a form.

227
00:16:49,564 --> 00:16:58,907
So I built all of those questions into a Google Doc, which would need to be transferred somehow into ownership by MPS.

228
00:16:59,747 --> 00:17:07,910
But the Google Doc is there to say, from a reporting year standpoint, which most are July 1 to June 30,

229
00:17:09,301 --> 00:17:10,943
Who are the board of directors?

230
00:17:11,003 --> 00:17:11,864
What is the budget?

231
00:17:12,705 --> 00:17:15,448
Do they have articles filed with the AG's office?

232
00:17:15,508 --> 00:17:16,509
Do they have insurance?

233
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:20,254
There's just a whole slew of questions that just talk about what's the mission?

234
00:17:20,454 --> 00:17:22,957
How do they go about the mission in a high-level way?

235
00:17:23,537 --> 00:17:29,364
And then what kind of expertise do they have on hand and where do they need support from MPS?

236
00:17:29,969 --> 00:17:39,935
And in particular, the place where that comes up a lot is around the treasury function of these PTO groups, because most of them are 501c3s.

237
00:17:40,195 --> 00:17:55,443
And there's a whole slew of requirements around proper reporting of everything from how you pay vendors, to raffles, to all kinds of things that people may or may not be aware of.

238
00:17:55,623 --> 00:17:58,885
So I think part of the policy also outlined

239
00:17:59,467 --> 00:18:14,619
an ability for somebody from MPS to educate particularly the treasurers about their responsibilities so that as 501c3s and people who are well-intentioned, they're not inadvertently not following rules they didn't know existed.

240
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,061
So I think that's kind of the goal.

241
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:19,423
So all of that kind of lays out in the form.

242
00:18:20,102 --> 00:18:30,008
with the goal being that once a year, you can go in, you can fill out the form, you can attach documents if you need to around bylaws when they're updated, et cetera.

243
00:18:30,808 --> 00:18:37,692
And then at any point in time, there's some sort of visibility about all the groups who are working on behalf of Medford Public Schools.

244
00:18:38,513 --> 00:18:44,576
And it then allows all of you to have some awareness when somebody says, hey, does so-and-so really

245
00:18:45,963 --> 00:18:57,686
have an organization that is here to benefit Medford Public Schools, there's some way to know that without having to kind of scurry around and kind of check in with people you know or people you might think are involved.

246
00:18:58,986 --> 00:19:04,928
But I think the other thing that kind of came out of that is certainly an interest in the PTOs working together.

247
00:19:05,148 --> 00:19:10,990
And on another night we'll talk about some of the work the elementary schools are doing together this year that we're excited about.

248
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:12,530
But I think

249
00:19:13,106 --> 00:19:15,269
The accounting piece is really important.

250
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:22,057
It's something that comes up even when we talk about some of the citywide joint fundraising that we're gearing up to do.

251
00:19:22,809 --> 00:19:37,877
And it's been a lot of legwork to kind of find the right people who have been able to help us do the right thing for the right reasons from a reporting standpoint so that none of us end up in trouble from a tax standpoint.

252
00:19:37,938 --> 00:19:41,339
So I think that's a big piece, especially for the treasurers.

253
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:50,324
But overall, just some sort of transparency for all of you to know who's out there, doing what, for whom, and when, and all of that good stuff.

254
00:19:51,485 --> 00:19:52,385
But it's pretty simple.

255
00:19:52,445 --> 00:19:57,687
It shouldn't take more than a few minutes for people to fill out the form if they know who their board is and all of that stuff.

256
00:19:58,627 --> 00:20:05,429
But it needs to make its way into your domain, I guess, from a Google Form and storage perspective.

257
00:20:05,509 --> 00:20:09,610
And I certainly shouldn't have access to everybody's responses, which I do now.

258
00:20:09,671 --> 00:20:13,592
So we just need to figure out how those mechanics move.

259
00:20:13,652 --> 00:20:17,753
And then they would also have to be released out to all the

260
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:22,261
the organizations, whoever has that list, so that they know that that's expected.

261
00:20:22,961 --> 00:20:23,321
Thank you.

262
00:20:24,381 --> 00:20:47,486
Also, as a follow-up, I think it was pretty sure that we mandated all that used the method public schools as part of their fundraising in any way had to do the training and had to register their group in order to use our buildings, to allocate, to raise money, in any way, shape, or form,

263
00:20:48,051 --> 00:20:54,394
I totally forgot that and it just came flooding back to me when Ginny was sitting in the audience.

264
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:57,495
So that's why I brought it up, but I didn't want it to lose it again.

265
00:20:58,095 --> 00:21:12,441
Yeah, and there are some questions about, particularly from an accounting standpoint, there were a couple of questions in there to assess if somebody does this work for a living, there's probably not anything our training is going to tell them that they need to know.

266
00:21:12,561 --> 00:21:17,123
So there is a mechanism to exempt folks who are particularly qualified.

267
00:21:17,802 --> 00:21:24,708
But I think it will, from a volunteering perspective, I think it will also help people understand that there is support.

268
00:21:24,768 --> 00:21:33,795
So if you have somebody who, like myself, who has a finance degree but does not practice in accounting, conceptually, I think I could do that job.

269
00:21:34,056 --> 00:21:40,121
But without knowing about all the filings, there's no way that anybody would be able to get it right on a volunteer basis.

270
00:21:40,161 --> 00:21:46,366
So I think you'll see more people be willing to take on that really important job in these organizations if they know there's some support.

271
00:21:48,109 --> 00:21:56,156
So if I understand that the steps that need to happen are one, this document needs to be transferred to the Medford Public Schools and listed on our website.

272
00:21:56,577 --> 00:22:05,104
And then some outreach needs to be done so each of the PTOs and organizations are contacted and informed that they need to send this out.

273
00:22:06,486 --> 00:22:09,048
And so that's a major piece.

274
00:22:09,088 --> 00:22:13,312
I'm not sure that's all going to happen by the date that we originally had set out.

275
00:22:14,113 --> 00:22:15,034
Yeah, probably not.

276
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:15,876
Probably not.

277
00:22:16,857 --> 00:22:19,220
But I think starting is important.

278
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:29,074
And the other thing that we outlined in that policy is that you all have an expectation that these groups are going to come before you on an annual basis in some fashion.

279
00:22:29,615 --> 00:22:31,077
So you can have a little bit of

280
00:22:31,782 --> 00:22:37,345
information from them about what they're up to and how they're doing it at a different level of detail.

281
00:22:38,446 --> 00:22:43,129
And we outlined and laid out various ways that we would allow people to do that.

282
00:22:43,289 --> 00:22:54,135
But the importance is, if somebody's out there raising $40,000 for Chromebooks, you all should know that that's happening, because it's a great news story that sometimes doesn't get told.

283
00:22:55,536 --> 00:23:01,139
And then there's all kinds of other things that happen on behalf of the schools that I think it's impossible for you guys to know about.

284
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:02,761
Thank you.

285
00:23:02,781 --> 00:23:03,201
Mr. Russo.

286
00:23:04,182 --> 00:23:04,362
Yes.

287
00:23:05,102 --> 00:23:05,462
Thank you.

288
00:23:06,382 --> 00:23:12,624
I'm just noticing we have, later on in the agenda, an acceptance of a gift from the Kiwanis.

289
00:23:13,765 --> 00:23:31,130
And I'm just realizing that when we went, I served with Jenny on this subcommittee, and I'm realizing that, did we really think about, like, if the Kiwanis is having a fundraiser, ostensibly to raise money to buy stuff

290
00:23:31,818 --> 00:23:37,280
for public schools, then the policy really means that Kiwanis has to go through this.

291
00:23:38,161 --> 00:23:50,206
I mean, you can't say you're raising money for our kids, and then use that to raise money, and then we have no idea, transparency-wise, like, so you raised $50,000?

292
00:23:50,526 --> 00:23:52,947
How'd you spend it?

293
00:23:52,967 --> 00:23:59,189
I mean, to me, that's kind of the point of this, is if the PTO has raised $50,000,

294
00:24:01,088 --> 00:24:04,129
and we don't know where it goes or how they spend it, we care about that.

295
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:16,155
So I'm not sure why, like if the policy, as I remember it as being written, if you're raising money in the name of Medford Public Schools or our children, our students, you must comply with this.

296
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:23,519
And I just realized that I don't think we thought through international organizations.

297
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:27,380
So we may need to revisit the policy in some way to rehash that.

298
00:24:27,761 --> 00:24:30,502
But I do know for a fact that the policy as written,

299
00:24:31,213 --> 00:24:37,457
Kiwanis, and anybody else who says they're raising money for Medford Public Schools to register with us.

300
00:24:37,477 --> 00:24:39,098
I mean, these are 501c3s.

301
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:41,039
It's not like they don't know how to do all this.

302
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:56,289
But the key thing, one of the transparency was, the good news stories are important, but also at budget time, it's nice to know that we budget $50,000 for supplies, but we rely on $200,000 from everybody else.

303
00:24:58,925 --> 00:25:09,871
We don't know what supplies cost if we have a budget for a number, and we spend far more than that, or supplies just get dropped off all over the place at centers and in schools.

304
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:17,055
It'd be nice to know what supplies cost, and we don't actually have an answer to that question because they're just coming at us from all over the place.

305
00:25:17,155 --> 00:25:24,299
So the transparency for me wasn't so much because I'm concerned people are doing anything nefarious, it's just that

306
00:25:25,321 --> 00:25:29,004
we can't answer simple basic questions about what it costs to run our schools.

307
00:25:29,865 --> 00:25:30,165
So.

308
00:25:31,666 --> 00:25:32,367
Mr. Jerome?

309
00:25:33,328 --> 00:25:37,731
Mayor Burke, maybe we have to refresh, review the policy.

310
00:25:37,771 --> 00:25:38,712
I think that's a good idea.

311
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:45,318
But to my knowledge, wasn't it that they have to use the facility on a regular basis or is it just one time like the Kiwanis?

312
00:25:46,381 --> 00:25:48,682
I don't know if that's a good way to put it.

313
00:25:58,055 --> 00:26:00,616
to our third graders, everyone gets a dictionary or whatnot.

314
00:26:01,296 --> 00:26:06,778
So it's not really, their fundraiser isn't, like the PTO, everything they do is for this process.

315
00:26:06,958 --> 00:26:22,763
Right, well, and we're actively working on an event at the Brooks right now, which is happening on Sunday, and we try to be careful about how we ask people for things, but we are, people are saying, hey Wegmans, can you help us?

316
00:26:23,163 --> 00:26:24,784
Hey Ajero, can you help us?

317
00:26:26,112 --> 00:26:29,754
There are things like that that go on in all the schools in all kinds of different ways.

318
00:26:30,294 --> 00:26:38,559
But all the money that we raise is going towards activities to support the Brooks, because that is our sole mission.

319
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:43,301
Where I feel like the Kiwanis, I'm assuming, has a slightly broader mission.

320
00:26:43,521 --> 00:26:45,422
And so perhaps that's the way to exempt it.

321
00:26:45,703 --> 00:26:49,885
Our sole purpose as an elementary school PTO is to raise money

322
00:26:50,935 --> 00:26:53,576
to benefit the school in which we're associated.

323
00:26:53,876 --> 00:27:00,879
Similar to Friends of Softball, that's strictly for Medford school, it's not for outside entities that can accept the gifts.

324
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:03,300
Right, so there just may need to be some sort of amendment.

325
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:05,721
Mr. Russo.

326
00:27:06,921 --> 00:27:09,962
I just, I guess I'm seeing this a little differently.

327
00:27:10,142 --> 00:27:17,325
The American Cancer Association or Society raises gazillions of dollars and all of their advertising has children in it.

328
00:27:18,032 --> 00:27:21,434
even though only a small portion goes to pediatric cancers.

329
00:27:21,814 --> 00:27:28,198
And they do that because they know we'll open up our pocketbooks for when we see pictures of kids.

330
00:27:28,458 --> 00:27:30,639
And I don't have any problem with that, actually.

331
00:27:31,099 --> 00:27:42,405
But I just want to know that there aren't organizations of any size and caliber saying, we're raising money for Medford Public Schools, and then a portion of that actually gets to Medford Public Schools.

332
00:27:43,226 --> 00:27:47,448
If you say you're raising money, and you list Medford Public Schools,

333
00:27:48,323 --> 00:27:52,366
If 5% goes to Medford Public Schools, you need to say, thank you for your donation of $100.

334
00:27:53,187 --> 00:27:55,628
Five of it's going to Medford Public Schools.

335
00:27:55,969 --> 00:27:58,250
I want to know that and expect that.

336
00:27:58,831 --> 00:28:04,455
If you were going to say, you're raising money for our schools, I don't think that's unreasonable.

337
00:28:06,516 --> 00:28:11,340
And I think that's a level of transparency that's not outside.

338
00:28:12,241 --> 00:28:16,824
I will say it takes about four minutes to fill out the form.

339
00:28:17,267 --> 00:28:24,390
if you have any level of infrastructure, even PTO level infrastructure, they can fill out this form in four minutes.

340
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:35,295
So I think if there are organizations like that that you guys want to be aware of, it's probably the least time intensive thing that they would get asked to do on any given day.

341
00:28:35,415 --> 00:28:45,480
So from that perspective, it should, and we tried not to make it burdensome because when you talk about PTOs and friends of the band and all that stuff,

342
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:47,089
They are all volunteers.

343
00:28:47,349 --> 00:28:48,530
They all have day jobs.

344
00:28:48,591 --> 00:28:51,795
They all are hardworking folks who are doing this on the side.

345
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:54,698
So we tried really hard not to make it cumbersome for anybody.

346
00:28:54,778 --> 00:29:03,569
So I would imagine that if you went down that road of asking folks like the Kiwanis to weigh in, that it would be no big deal for them to get it done.

347
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:09,765
This is not on our calendar, so we really shouldn't be delving into this depth or this.

348
00:29:10,106 --> 00:29:18,155
You requested an update and for you to be aware of this policy, so I think that we need to leave this now because we're venturing into bad land.

349
00:29:19,503 --> 00:29:20,663
Is it on a different item?

350
00:29:20,903 --> 00:29:21,784
While we're under suspension.

351
00:29:21,824 --> 00:29:23,004
While we're under suspension.

352
00:29:23,384 --> 00:29:23,884
Thank you, Jen.

353
00:29:24,004 --> 00:29:31,207
We received in our packets an update on the pressers, which I had requested last week.

354
00:29:31,287 --> 00:29:32,527
But yet, it was not on.

355
00:29:32,607 --> 00:29:35,328
There was nothing referenced on our agenda.

356
00:29:35,348 --> 00:29:46,532
So I just wanted to mention, since we're not going to update the General Welcome, that one of the things that we've seen is that many of our pressers

357
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:55,037
with compressors, and as my colleague noted, they're 15,000 a cup.

358
00:29:55,057 --> 00:30:07,043
So this is a very important, you know, when we had those hot days, and all of a sudden we were relying on the air conditioning, this is a very important piece of it.

359
00:30:07,063 --> 00:30:18,749
And obviously, before we put off being able to replace these compressors when they should have been, I'm making the point of it because I think that, you know, as we speak about a,

360
00:30:19,922 --> 00:30:34,875
capital plan, this is clearly a unit, a place that we need to consider now, putting money aside, so that when we have these hot days, as we did at the historic school, we will be able to turn on the air conditioning effectively.

361
00:30:34,915 --> 00:30:37,037
So I just wanted to reference that since it was proposed.

362
00:30:37,077 --> 00:30:37,537
Thank you.

363
00:30:37,617 --> 00:30:43,623
Is there a motion to revert to the regular order of business by Mr. Benedetto, seconded by Mr. Russo?

364
00:30:43,683 --> 00:30:44,543
All those in favor?

365
00:30:45,324 --> 00:30:46,085
All those opposed?

366
00:30:46,205 --> 00:30:47,006
Motion passes.

367
00:30:48,241 --> 00:30:51,063
Report on Roberts Playground Construction Project.

368
00:30:52,223 --> 00:30:52,443
Ms.

369
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:53,184
Patterson.

370
00:30:55,665 --> 00:30:56,205
Good evening.

371
00:30:56,605 --> 00:30:57,066
Good evening.

372
00:30:58,466 --> 00:31:16,276
I'm happy to report as a follow-up from last school committee meeting, there has been working groups with the identified parties at City Hall, the Chief Procurement Officer, City Solicitor, as well as meetings with our

373
00:31:16,743 --> 00:31:23,546
public representatives, Mr. Benedetto, Councilor Luongo, and Cheryl Rodriguez.

374
00:31:24,267 --> 00:31:43,716
So for the interest of our public to know where we are in this process, I'm just going to briefly read the update that we did work with our city chief procurement officer, city solicitor, and we further reviewed the OSD, or Operational Services Division, bid listing under FAC 104.

375
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,717
That meeting did take place.

376
00:31:46,274 --> 00:31:49,055
A phone call was made to the Attorney General's office.

377
00:31:49,336 --> 00:31:58,460
Mr. Brian O'Donnell was communicated with as to the ability to use a state contract with bids that had been received for labor costs over $50,000.

378
00:31:59,701 --> 00:32:09,506
As referenced on the attached FAC contract, page three, under the user guide for recreation equipment and the related products,

379
00:32:10,068 --> 00:32:16,630
It did indicate that purchasers must ensure that any services involving construction are limited to $50,000 or less.

380
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:21,832
So again, this is key to the timeline that was shared and the process that has gone through.

381
00:32:22,292 --> 00:32:27,694
Unfortunately, it took more time than what was initially hoped for.

382
00:32:28,434 --> 00:32:38,517
Further, it was reviewed that additional requirements for the use of state bids was necessary due to the size and scope of the project that was identified on page five of the attached guideline.

383
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:50,346
And in that reference, it says, for orders over $10,000, eligible entities are required to solicit multiple quotes from contractors of their choice prior to issuing an order.

384
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:59,411
So we then followed up and the procurement officer requested quotes from three vendors that were identified on the OSD state bid list.

385
00:32:59,911 --> 00:33:07,895
We received only the one response from Rubber Recycle, Travis Arms, who is based out of Lakewood, New Jersey.

386
00:33:08,638 --> 00:33:26,942
So the revised quote was broken down for $69,893 for materials and $19,788 for labor, expressing that payment for prevailing wage rates will be honored here under Massachusetts guidelines.

387
00:33:27,963 --> 00:33:28,303
Correct.

388
00:33:28,323 --> 00:33:32,084
So the total quote that came in from rubber recycle was the $89,681.

389
00:33:34,318 --> 00:33:38,380
This does not include the demolition breakdown of the existing unit.

390
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,803
That will be done by the city's landscaping contractor, Groundmasters.

391
00:33:43,423 --> 00:33:46,325
And all of this will be coordinated together.

392
00:33:46,805 --> 00:33:53,629
So the vendor had indicated a four to five week lead time for the materials delivered from the manufacturer.

393
00:33:54,610 --> 00:34:04,135
Once the firm delivery date is established, the Groundmasters city landscaper will be doing the demolition for the existing playground surface and prepare

394
00:34:04,829 --> 00:34:07,650
based on the specifications for install of new material.

395
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:16,852
It is estimated that one week will be needed for demolition and removal, and another week will be required for the final installation.

396
00:34:17,492 --> 00:34:23,454
And during that timeframe of the demolition and installation, the playground area will not be usable.

397
00:34:23,554 --> 00:34:31,255
However, arrangements will be worked out for safe recess activities and coordinated through Mr. Kirk Johnson.

398
00:34:32,076 --> 00:34:33,456
And as a follow-up,

399
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:45,685
I did receive a phone call from Mr. Travis Arms today, and I requested any expedited possibility for materials in stock.

400
00:34:46,426 --> 00:34:54,952
They are made to order, so there's no additional expediting outside of the four to five week time.

401
00:34:55,032 --> 00:35:02,097
They did have five color samples, which we have then shared with Mr. Johnson to finalize the color scheme that we will be

402
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:07,449
issuing the purchase order tomorrow once we get the W9 from our vendor.

403
00:35:08,109 --> 00:35:17,894
And he's going to provide the thickness and the required grading that our city landscaper will need to fulfill in preparation for that.

404
00:35:17,974 --> 00:35:26,398
And he did confirm that the timeline in terms of final installation would be roughly about a week.

405
00:35:26,498 --> 00:35:30,680
The difficulty is that these are radial size

406
00:35:31,312 --> 00:35:35,996
shape of the playground so that requires additional hand cutting, things of that sort.

407
00:35:36,036 --> 00:35:41,800
So it's a little more labor intensive than a traditional rectangular size.

408
00:35:42,201 --> 00:35:44,663
But he did indicate... He's aware of the shape of the playground.

409
00:35:45,283 --> 00:35:45,744
Correct.

410
00:35:46,084 --> 00:35:46,484
Correct.

411
00:35:46,945 --> 00:35:55,131
So that is the update and we are moving forward to get the materials from the manufacturer and delivered.

412
00:35:55,171 --> 00:35:56,212
And once we have a firm

413
00:35:56,851 --> 00:36:03,435
timeline for that, we will then schedule the Grandmaster's Landscaper for the demolition, and we will report that out to all involved.

414
00:36:03,475 --> 00:36:05,356
And there is a 10-year warranty on the product.

415
00:36:05,596 --> 00:36:06,016
Correct.

416
00:36:07,897 --> 00:36:08,097
Ms.

417
00:36:08,117 --> 00:36:08,697
DiBenedetto.

418
00:36:08,998 --> 00:36:09,378
Thank you.

419
00:36:09,678 --> 00:36:10,418
Thank you.

420
00:36:10,658 --> 00:36:15,321
First of all, I'd really like to thank a few people for their help throughout this project.

421
00:36:16,702 --> 00:36:16,882
Ms.

422
00:36:16,902 --> 00:36:26,627
Patterson, Assistant Superintendent, thank you for the time and effort for both you and your department that you've taken to help us get this to this point.

423
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:32,613
I also want to thank the superintendent for taking the time and making this a priority.

424
00:36:33,073 --> 00:36:36,536
Of course, the CPC, which allocated the funding for the project.

425
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:43,080
And I especially, we've learned a lot through the process how to apply for the CPC money.

426
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,521
And I know Ms.

427
00:36:45,541 --> 00:36:55,447
Patterson has plans to continue working through them for different projects throughout our school district and asking them so they'll, we'll get better at it.

428
00:36:56,323 --> 00:37:00,626
and they'll get to know what we need and what we want and what's coming forward.

429
00:37:01,126 --> 00:37:14,896
We learned a lot through the process and I'm grateful all the community members that came up and spoke at our last meeting and helped us learn different things and how to approach different things because we all can learn and move forward in different ways together as a team.

430
00:37:15,616 --> 00:37:24,222
Especially at this time, I want to thank Cheryl Rodriguez directly for taking the initiative to apply for this money

431
00:37:24,779 --> 00:37:28,100
and to not give up and to see it all the way to the end.

432
00:37:29,301 --> 00:37:45,567
Her dedication to this work and her school in general and the years that she's been serving on that PTO and as a parent at that school has really been inspiring to me as a committee member and to many families throughout our district.

433
00:37:46,927 --> 00:37:49,668
So I just wanted to really give that.

434
00:37:50,249 --> 00:37:51,269
Again, thank you, Ms.

435
00:37:51,289 --> 00:37:51,849
Patterson.

436
00:37:52,850 --> 00:37:54,190
I know there's still a lot more work

437
00:37:54,824 --> 00:37:56,266
And I'll probably say it again at the end.

438
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:59,489
And I just have one final question for tonight.

439
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,652
What color did they pick?

440
00:38:03,053 --> 00:38:05,095
Because Mr. Johnson is here.

441
00:38:05,996 --> 00:38:07,297
Can we do a Mustang blue?

442
00:38:08,358 --> 00:38:08,838
Blue.

443
00:38:08,879 --> 00:38:10,300
Mustang blue all the way.

444
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:10,981
Good choice.

445
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:11,701
Good choice.

446
00:38:12,923 --> 00:38:13,403
Thank you.

447
00:38:13,603 --> 00:38:14,304
Thank you again.

448
00:38:15,646 --> 00:38:16,326
Mr. Ruggiero?

449
00:38:16,606 --> 00:38:17,948
Yeah, well, I certainly

450
00:38:18,612 --> 00:38:20,712
think that the mustang blue is a great color choice.

451
00:38:20,772 --> 00:38:24,653
I think it might be an interesting idea to allow some of the students to pick out the color.

452
00:38:25,373 --> 00:38:34,675
Is it possible that we, I know time is short, but is it possible that we could open up maybe for like a little informal vote to get the kids a little jazzed about the whole project?

453
00:38:35,195 --> 00:38:41,937
I think for the interest of time, we need to expedite this and move forward so that the manufacturing can begin.

454
00:38:42,017 --> 00:38:43,777
I understand.

455
00:38:43,837 --> 00:38:44,077
Thank you.

456
00:38:45,388 --> 00:38:49,170
I just again repeat the thank yous.

457
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:53,853
Thank you, Christine, for continuing your work on this and for the people at City Hall.

458
00:38:53,973 --> 00:38:59,336
And thank you, Cheryl, for being tenacious and bringing the information last week.

459
00:39:00,656 --> 00:39:02,197
I can't wait for the dedication.

460
00:39:03,778 --> 00:39:04,438
Thank you very much.

461
00:39:04,879 --> 00:39:07,360
On the motion to accept this report and place it on file.

462
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,321
All those in favor?

463
00:39:09,021 --> 00:39:09,681
All those opposed?

464
00:39:09,961 --> 00:39:10,682
Motion passes.

465
00:39:12,682 --> 00:39:15,884
Report on Dr. Maurice Edouard Vincent's entry plan.

466
00:39:18,185 --> 00:39:18,565
Doctor?

467
00:39:20,566 --> 00:39:21,567
Good evening, everyone.

468
00:39:22,327 --> 00:39:22,887
Good evening.

469
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:41,037
So within your hands right now is the entry plan that I have been using as I've arrived in Medford.

470
00:39:41,862 --> 00:39:55,551
And so there are three key pieces to the plan, where the plan is an opportunity for me to have the chance to listen, learn, and be able to lead.

471
00:39:57,753 --> 00:40:01,855
I start the entry plan with an introductory letter.

472
00:40:03,316 --> 00:40:11,522
If you'll indulge me, I'll just quickly read the letter to you and just point out some of the key highlights of the entry plan.

473
00:40:13,573 --> 00:40:21,497
So it is with great excitement and expectation that I begin this new academic year as the Medford Superintendent of Schools.

474
00:40:23,358 --> 00:40:32,523
It was 24 years ago that I began my career in education, and now I have come full circle, serving the entire Medford Public School District.

475
00:40:33,523 --> 00:40:40,787
Over the course of my career, I have worn hats, many hats, as a teacher, a lead teacher, assistant principal,

476
00:40:43,335 --> 00:40:47,799
principal, network, and instructional superintendent, and now superintendent of schools.

477
00:40:48,859 --> 00:40:59,828
Although I have many experiences, I am beginning a new journey with eight uniquely diverse schools, and this entry plan is the roadmap that I will follow.

478
00:41:01,369 --> 00:41:08,595
In order to foster strong communication, collaboration, and achievement, I must take time to learn about all of the schools.

479
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:16,694
the school leaders, the school communities, and critical stakeholders that make our schools successful.

480
00:41:18,675 --> 00:41:28,560
In order to do this effectively, I will be visiting all our schools and working collaboratively with school administrators, directors, and central office staff.

481
00:41:29,461 --> 00:41:36,024
Additionally, I will be reaching out to community partners to schedule or attend community meetings.

482
00:41:36,765 --> 00:41:37,345
My goal

483
00:41:38,142 --> 00:41:44,124
is for us and for all of us to be able to touch base and look at ways to deepen our existing partnerships.

484
00:41:45,465 --> 00:41:59,929
As I gather information from all my internal and external stakeholders, I will analyze the data and make the necessary adjustments to keep the focus on accelerating achievement for our nearly 4,800 students in Medford.

485
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:04,391
This entry plan will be a journey of listening,

486
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:09,281
observing, reflecting, commenting, adjusting, and growing.

487
00:42:10,802 --> 00:42:14,783
In closing, I thank you for the warm reception that I have received thus far.

488
00:42:15,743 --> 00:42:25,065
My core values that guide my work are ACE, achievement, believing in high achievement, collaboration, and equity.

489
00:42:25,926 --> 00:42:30,847
I look forward to this new journey of listening, learning, and leading together.

490
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:34,728
In partnership for children, Maurice Edward Vincent.

491
00:42:36,073 --> 00:42:57,110
And so I just wanted to say that this journey, starting in July, having the opportunity to listen, to meet one-on-one with all school leaders, with all members here of the school committee, asking consistent questions, trying to gather information.

492
00:42:58,031 --> 00:43:01,874
And I am continuing to meet with school leaders,

493
00:43:02,770 --> 00:43:05,291
and other central office administrators.

494
00:43:05,351 --> 00:43:14,035
And so this will continue to happen, continuing through September and into October, which would be the listening phase.

495
00:43:16,255 --> 00:43:22,678
As we transition between from, I would say, October, I want to move into the learning phase.

496
00:43:23,518 --> 00:43:27,660
And during that learning phase, I will have the opportunity

497
00:43:28,342 --> 00:43:31,123
to look at a lot of critical documents.

498
00:43:31,203 --> 00:43:38,607
And those of you who have the entry plan, I've jumped over to page five, going on to page six.

499
00:43:39,287 --> 00:43:43,729
And so I do give a list of the documents that will be reviewed.

500
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:56,375
And there are more, but this is just a sampling, looking at our state data, our district assessments that we give, whether it's AP tests,

501
00:43:57,204 --> 00:44:04,027
our school improvement plans, looking at data, looking at our subgroups, looking at areas where we have not excelled.

502
00:44:04,887 --> 00:44:14,351
That's an important part of creating our next phase or our next roadmap for how we're going to excel in areas where we struggle.

503
00:44:14,971 --> 00:44:23,775
Looking at our data for our English language learners, the WIDA access test, looking at data for our students with disabilities,

504
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:27,352
and working closely with our special education department.

505
00:44:28,893 --> 00:44:46,044
Looking again at attendance and suspension data, looking at family engagement data, so I appreciate finding out about this Google form because that will be part of engaging our family groups and the different booster organizations that support Medford Public Schools.

506
00:44:47,304 --> 00:44:51,447
Looking at our scheduling, looking at our pacing guides that we use

507
00:44:52,112 --> 00:45:06,781
for our curriculum in schools, continuing to monitor our enrollment projections, looking at our staffing allocations, our emergency plans, and continuing to review our budget.

508
00:45:06,861 --> 00:45:18,028
So it is a wide area of documents that I am collecting and information that's being gathered during this phase two, which is the learning phase.

509
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:20,990
The final phase of the entry plan

510
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:28,871
would be taking all of that data and really looking at how I will continue to lead Medford Public Schools.

511
00:45:29,731 --> 00:45:47,385
And taking the information from the findings, from the interviews, from interactions with both internal and external stakeholders, taking all of that information to come up with the strongest plan to accelerate student achievement for all of our learners.

512
00:45:48,073 --> 00:46:16,348
So I hope, my intention is, I'm now on page seven, that by December of 18, that I will be at a good point to really take the data that I've gathered from July until December and compile that data to be prepared to make a presentation here to the school committee sometime in January

513
00:46:17,118 --> 00:46:31,284
possibly early February to give you the findings, and that information will go into planning our district plan, our strategic plan, our academic plan for school year 2019.

514
00:46:31,324 --> 00:46:46,050
The entry plan, I am part of the NISP program, the New Superintendents Induction Program, and my coach is Dr. Carla Baer, who was also

515
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:58,924
former superintendent and brings a great amount of experience in both multiple settings as a former superintendent.

516
00:46:59,004 --> 00:47:15,371
And she has been working closely with me and I would like to also give her an opportunity to come and speak with you as a school committee and the community to know what I am learning during our new superintendent induction classes.

517
00:47:16,068 --> 00:47:21,552
and the things that I'm learning that I will also be able to apply here to the school district.

518
00:47:22,132 --> 00:47:32,360
So that is my entry plan in a nutshell, but it is just to lay out the work that I've been doing thus far and the work that I plan to continue doing.

519
00:47:33,521 --> 00:47:34,721
Excellent, very nice.

520
00:47:34,741 --> 00:47:37,343
Are there any questions from the body?

521
00:47:38,864 --> 00:47:39,045
Ms.

522
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:39,445
Mustone.

523
00:47:40,788 --> 00:47:41,749
Thank you.

524
00:47:42,929 --> 00:47:48,153
By the list of the documents you're going to review, you have your work cut out for you, and I appreciate it.

525
00:47:48,273 --> 00:47:57,279
But I did want to just add one thing that had been an ongoing conversation for the last two years was the maintenance and upkeep and renovation of many of our school buildings.

526
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:09,287
So I don't know if maybe on that list you could just have Mr. McLaughlin give you an update of what really needs to be done, like Member van der Kloot said about the compresses, 15,000 for our

527
00:48:11,298 --> 00:48:12,498
30, I think, was it?

528
00:48:12,658 --> 00:48:13,338
How many in total?

529
00:48:13,779 --> 00:48:15,459
Right, 15,000, but we need 30 of them.

530
00:48:16,359 --> 00:48:18,400
How many?

531
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:18,400
17?

532
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:19,040
Right.

533
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:23,220
So that's just the only other thing that I know that we've had conversations about many times.

534
00:48:23,681 --> 00:48:34,203
Definitely, the capital plan and thinking about how we can work strategically on the city side to come up with very creative ways.

535
00:48:34,283 --> 00:48:39,104
So I will be working closely with them, and physical plant is definitely important.

536
00:48:39,624 --> 00:48:40,204
Thank you for that.

537
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:57,423
Superintendent, well, you've had a chance now to get your feet wet a little bit, and I'm just wondering what your plan is in terms of an administrative assistant, or whether you're still thinking of what the central office should look like.

538
00:48:57,923 --> 00:49:07,505
Yes, so the administrative assistant position is actually posted right now, and we are in the process of reviewing resumes.

539
00:49:09,264 --> 00:49:17,089
Yeah, so the end is near, and an administrative assistant hopefully will be able to have someone in place soon.

540
00:49:17,769 --> 00:49:18,410
Okay, thank you.

541
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:20,091
Thank you.

542
00:49:20,111 --> 00:49:25,073
Is there a motion to accept this report and place it on file by Mr. Agiro, seconded by Ms.

543
00:49:25,134 --> 00:49:25,454
Kretz?

544
00:49:26,194 --> 00:49:26,935
All those in favor?

545
00:49:27,595 --> 00:49:28,456
All those opposed?

546
00:49:28,616 --> 00:49:29,336
Motion passes.

547
00:49:30,697 --> 00:49:34,679
Next item, report on Agiro and Kiwanis donations to Medford Public Schools.

548
00:49:34,959 --> 00:49:35,140
Ms.

549
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:35,620
Caldwell.

550
00:49:36,062 --> 00:49:36,662
Good evening.

551
00:49:36,742 --> 00:49:39,184
So this is one of those reports we love to do.

552
00:49:39,924 --> 00:49:46,688
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank Agero and the Kiwanians for all they do for the kids in Medford.

553
00:49:47,369 --> 00:49:59,315
This year, Sandy Reyes, who's the person I always speak with when I go over to Agero, told me that there were 40 additional backpacks for our Medford Public Schools children this year.

554
00:49:59,335 --> 00:50:00,216
So there were over 100.

555
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:05,399
And they were filled to the brim with all kinds of supplies that children need.

556
00:50:06,038 --> 00:50:18,420
notebooks, pens, paper, pencils, folders, and she said it was like a contest at a jail to see which team of people could fill the most backpacks for our kiddos.

557
00:50:19,581 --> 00:50:27,602
And our principals always decide that the kids in need, when they're delivered to the schools, our disadvantaged population should get the backpacks.

558
00:50:27,642 --> 00:50:31,403
Sometimes principals empty out the backpacks and just save all the supplies.

559
00:50:31,864 --> 00:50:36,748
And then as the year goes on, disseminate them to the staff, to the children.

560
00:50:38,129 --> 00:50:42,874
Parents and families are just very thankful to get some extra supplies for their kiddos.

561
00:50:44,735 --> 00:50:48,398
But we are also fortunate to have the Kiwanians with us.

562
00:50:48,699 --> 00:50:58,167
And this past summer, in June, at the end of the school year, as they always do, they go to each and every one of our elementary schools

563
00:50:58,832 --> 00:51:00,392
and give our kids books.

564
00:51:00,493 --> 00:51:07,535
The first and third graders go to the library, which is an appropriate place, and they get bags of books.

565
00:51:07,635 --> 00:51:17,477
And so sometimes those kids can't wait to open those bags so that they can exchange books with a friend, even before they get back to their classroom.

566
00:51:17,998 --> 00:51:20,698
So I'd just like to name a few people that I'd like to thank.

567
00:51:21,179 --> 00:51:25,860
David Ferrick, who is CEO and President of Agero, and the employees.

568
00:51:26,663 --> 00:51:47,249
And from the Kiwanis Club, I would like to thank Richard Carviello, who's chairman of the Literacy Committee, Kelly Catalo, Dominic Camara, Paul Donato, Liz Salini, Mark Tonello, Rita Cornelius, Patty, and John Costas for all they do for Medford Public Schools.

569
00:51:47,289 --> 00:51:52,170
We are so lucky to have generous people in our neighborhoods who give back to our children.

570
00:51:52,746 --> 00:51:53,547
Thank you so much, Ms.

571
00:51:53,587 --> 00:51:53,927
Caldwell.

572
00:51:53,947 --> 00:51:57,710
Can we please send thank yous on behalf of the school committee to these entities?

573
00:51:58,711 --> 00:51:58,831
Yes.

574
00:51:58,891 --> 00:51:59,512
Mr. Benedetto.

575
00:51:59,912 --> 00:52:01,113
That's what I was going to ask.

576
00:52:01,213 --> 00:52:06,337
These people are continually in front of us making donations to the students in this community.

577
00:52:06,878 --> 00:52:10,040
And I would like to send a thank you note as well.

578
00:52:10,180 --> 00:52:10,601
Thank you.

579
00:52:11,341 --> 00:52:14,404
Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report placed in a file by Ms.

580
00:52:14,464 --> 00:52:15,705
Kritz, seconded by Ms.

581
00:52:15,785 --> 00:52:16,425
Van de Kloot?

582
00:52:16,485 --> 00:52:17,166
All those in favor?

583
00:52:17,186 --> 00:52:17,246
Aye.

584
00:52:17,266 --> 00:52:18,367
All those opposed?

585
00:52:18,407 --> 00:52:19,188
Motion passes.

586
00:52:19,808 --> 00:52:21,590
Report on sixth grade numbers.

587
00:52:32,166 --> 00:52:32,646
Good evening.

588
00:52:32,906 --> 00:52:38,789
Good evening, Superintendent Edward Vincent, Mayor Burke, and members of the Medford School Committee.

589
00:52:39,269 --> 00:52:58,096
So this report is in response to a question that was raised at the September 6th committee meeting, and the question specifically was of the students who were selected in the lottery in early June, of those students who were selected to go to the McGlynn from the Brooks,

590
00:52:59,034 --> 00:53:01,075
Did any of those students leave the district?

591
00:53:01,216 --> 00:53:02,777
And the answer is no.

592
00:53:03,317 --> 00:53:05,839
So I went through the profile of all 17 students.

593
00:53:06,499 --> 00:53:19,829
All 17 students are currently enrolled at the McGlynn, and all 17 students had been attending, are attending the McGlynn, and that was as of the date the report was written, which was September 11th.

594
00:53:21,826 --> 00:53:22,706
Thank you very much.

595
00:53:23,167 --> 00:53:23,667
You're welcome.

596
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:27,068
Is there a motion on the floor to accept this report and place it on file by Ms.

597
00:53:27,108 --> 00:53:28,149
Mustone, seconded by Ms.

598
00:53:28,189 --> 00:53:28,469
Krutz?

599
00:53:28,609 --> 00:53:29,369
All those in favor?

600
00:53:29,589 --> 00:53:30,230
All those opposed?

601
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:31,010
Motion passes.

602
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:34,272
Report on opening of Bistro 489.

603
00:53:36,933 --> 00:53:37,733
Mr. Fallon?

604
00:53:43,336 --> 00:53:43,796
Good evening.

605
00:53:43,816 --> 00:53:44,336
Good evening.

606
00:53:45,657 --> 00:53:45,997
How are you?

607
00:53:46,257 --> 00:53:46,837
Good, how are you?

608
00:53:46,937 --> 00:53:47,938
Good, thanks.

609
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:48,798
Just wanted to give an update.

610
00:53:48,818 --> 00:53:51,099
So October 3rd is the opening of the Bistro.

611
00:53:51,912 --> 00:53:56,434
That's the official opening date that will be open to the community, as well as faculty and staff.

612
00:53:57,034 --> 00:54:01,236
So it's going to be open on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays for breakfast each day.

613
00:54:01,496 --> 00:54:04,617
And then on Thursdays and Fridays, it's going to be open for breakfast and lunch.

614
00:54:05,237 --> 00:54:06,338
So please spread the word.

615
00:54:06,378 --> 00:54:08,899
October 3rd, Wednesday is the opening.

616
00:54:09,959 --> 00:54:18,582
We are working right now on a policy that I'll be presenting to the school committee for approval on building rentals, fee schedules, and the like.

617
00:54:19,543 --> 00:54:20,303
So we're excited.

618
00:54:21,604 --> 00:54:24,586
8 a.m., 8 to 12.30 are the hours.

619
00:54:25,147 --> 00:54:26,648
So is it Wednesday it's the opening?

620
00:54:26,948 --> 00:54:27,749
Wednesday, October 3rd.

621
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:29,930
So it'll be just breakfast, or is Wednesday a hybrid day?

622
00:54:29,950 --> 00:54:30,871
Wednesday will be just breakfast.

623
00:54:31,051 --> 00:54:32,212
Just breakfast on Wednesday.

624
00:54:34,594 --> 00:54:35,655
I think I can get you guys in.

625
00:54:37,516 --> 00:54:40,158
How many students are participating in the culinary arts program?

626
00:54:40,358 --> 00:54:46,023
So right now we have a total of, I believe, 10, 10 to 12 right now in culinary.

627
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:48,565
And one instructor?

628
00:54:48,905 --> 00:54:49,025
Two.

629
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,540
We still have two.

630
00:54:51,361 --> 00:54:51,801
One left.

631
00:54:52,281 --> 00:54:53,481
Yeah, we had three.

632
00:54:56,442 --> 00:54:56,742
Great.

633
00:54:57,762 --> 00:54:58,562
Mr. Benedetto.

634
00:54:58,703 --> 00:54:59,103
Thank you.

635
00:55:00,523 --> 00:55:04,024
Could you give us an idea of the cost involved for a breakfast or a lunch?

636
00:55:04,904 --> 00:55:06,965
Just so the community knows what to bring in.

637
00:55:07,025 --> 00:55:07,945
Is it cash only?

638
00:55:07,965 --> 00:55:10,826
No, it's actually not going to be cash.

639
00:55:10,886 --> 00:55:14,327
The point of sale system will accept credit cards, so that's good.

640
00:55:14,387 --> 00:55:14,787
No cash?

641
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:16,819
No, cash they can do.

642
00:55:16,859 --> 00:55:17,599
Yeah, cash as well.

643
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:22,221
As far as the menu goes, they're still tweaking it as we speak.

644
00:55:22,241 --> 00:55:26,442
So they're still going to offer the famous, you know, stangwich and things that they've done in the past.

645
00:55:26,802 --> 00:55:27,842
It's very, very reasonable.

646
00:55:28,282 --> 00:55:31,683
I don't know the prices off the top of my head, but they are working on revising the menu a bit.

647
00:55:32,243 --> 00:55:36,565
And will all of that be on the website so people can check it out ahead of time?

648
00:55:36,585 --> 00:55:41,086
Yeah, we're going to have an online menu available because there's also going to be the Cafe Electra.

649
00:55:41,106 --> 00:55:44,147
The old name is actually what we call the takeout portion.

650
00:55:44,167 --> 00:55:45,627
So Cafe Electra, food on the fly.

651
00:55:46,693 --> 00:55:49,635
is gonna be for takeout, and that's gonna be available online, too.

652
00:55:49,995 --> 00:55:50,596
Oh, that's great.

653
00:55:50,676 --> 00:55:53,197
While all the teachers, they can grab their breakfast and go.

654
00:55:53,217 --> 00:56:02,122
Yeah, and I can share with you, too, something that kind of transpired today over the last few weeks is we're gonna be working with students in the Access and the Transitional Program.

655
00:56:02,142 --> 00:56:04,964
They've been running a coffee shop in the cafeteria for years.

656
00:56:04,984 --> 00:56:15,590
We're gonna close that down and have them come over to the Bistro, and they're gonna be actually operating a coffee shop, if you will, under the Cafe Electra booth for coffee in the morning periods one and two for teachers.

657
00:56:16,485 --> 00:56:19,466
So that's something we're really happy about.

658
00:56:19,846 --> 00:56:23,747
Has that been advertised at all to the community or to the parents?

659
00:56:23,968 --> 00:56:31,470
Not yet, because I just today met with the teachers and I met with the Jan Hollenbeck and people last week about how we were going to make it all happen.

660
00:56:31,550 --> 00:56:40,753
So we're still in the planning phases, but we will be sharing the news when we really get up and running, because we think it's a great idea to get everybody involved.

661
00:56:41,233 --> 00:56:42,954
And lunch is served from what time to what?

662
00:56:43,754 --> 00:56:45,415
So it's gonna be open 8 to 1230, so.

663
00:56:45,476 --> 00:56:46,917
Just open the whole.

664
00:56:47,177 --> 00:56:47,557
Correct.

665
00:56:47,577 --> 00:56:47,737
Okay.

666
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:48,338
Yeah.

667
00:56:48,898 --> 00:56:49,139
Great.

668
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:50,980
So we also have the foundry rooms.

669
00:56:52,081 --> 00:57:01,549
The policy we're writing for rental includes if it's gonna be a catered event with food, if it's gonna be just a meeting with a continental breakfast or a coffee service or beverage service.

670
00:57:02,770 --> 00:57:10,076
It's gonna encompass all the different things that we could anticipate from people wanting to rent the space as well.

671
00:57:11,016 --> 00:57:11,357
Excellent.

672
00:57:12,112 --> 00:57:12,713
Mr. Russo.

673
00:57:15,815 --> 00:57:17,737
Motion to accept this report and place it in a file.

674
00:57:17,757 --> 00:57:18,337
Seconded by Ms.

675
00:57:18,377 --> 00:57:18,758
McStone.

676
00:57:18,778 --> 00:57:19,578
All those in favor?

677
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:20,799
All those opposed?

678
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:22,000
Motion passes.

679
00:57:23,522 --> 00:57:24,242
On this item.

680
00:57:34,911 --> 00:57:39,636
Some of these are just reports that were furnished to us and they weren't going to be discussed this evening.

681
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:46,503
Yeah, so if you just wanted to put something on later for another meeting, you have those reports handy.

682
00:57:47,563 --> 00:57:49,744
Report on Lesley University Partnership.

683
00:57:52,565 --> 00:58:05,691
Yes, I'm going to give the report on Lesley, but I would like to call up Bob Maloney, Mr. Maloney, and yes, Ms.

684
00:58:05,711 --> 00:58:09,953
Perry, Rachel Perry as well, to just give us a quick update on the

685
00:58:11,610 --> 00:58:12,431
Jim Floor, Parquet Floor.

686
00:58:12,451 --> 00:58:13,271
Leslie Jim Floor.

687
00:58:13,391 --> 00:58:13,491
Yes.

688
00:58:13,531 --> 00:58:13,992
Good evening.

689
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:16,193
Bobby Maloney, 61, Sheridan Ave, Medford.

690
00:58:17,074 --> 00:58:19,456
The Parquet Floors, it should be done this week.

691
00:58:20,236 --> 00:58:21,397
They finished painting today.

692
00:58:21,417 --> 00:58:25,039
They're going to polyurethane on Thursday and put the final coat on Saturday.

693
00:58:25,880 --> 00:58:29,683
So we're hoping our girls volleyball team will christen it next Tuesday afternoon.

694
00:58:31,604 --> 00:58:36,367
We're about three weeks behind schedule with all the heat and the humidity we've had over the last couple of weeks.

695
00:58:37,068 --> 00:58:38,289
But we'll keep you updated.

696
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:41,291
There's going to be some fantastic pitches going out online.

697
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:49,029
And it's just another asset that the Method Public Schools will have thanks to Leslie and the partnership that the mayor has created.

698
00:58:49,049 --> 00:58:56,635
Thank you.

699
00:58:57,976 --> 00:59:00,158
I had called Ms.

700
00:59:00,198 --> 00:59:01,539
Perry up as well, because I didn't know.

701
00:59:01,599 --> 00:59:03,641
I knew last week there was a question about the pool.

702
00:59:04,242 --> 00:59:07,584
But the report's in your folders.

703
00:59:08,325 --> 00:59:09,326
So thank you for that.

704
00:59:10,145 --> 00:59:28,595
I also want to just report out a little bit that's been happening with Lesley, and I'm really excited to share that our work with Lesley is not just going to be athletic, but that there is an authentic plan to have an academic partnership as well.

705
00:59:29,415 --> 00:59:38,940
So in late August, as you can see, on the 30th of August, we had the opportunity, my leadership team had the opportunity to meet with

706
00:59:39,430 --> 01:00:04,209
Lesley University Interim President, Dr. Richard Hanson, the Provost, Dr. Margaret Everett, the Associate Dean, Dr. Patricia Crandell-Agarce, Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Bernice Braden, and the Assistant Professor, the Director of the STEAM Learning Lab, Susan Cusack, to discuss our collaboration.

707
01:00:04,729 --> 01:00:05,810
And during that time,

708
01:00:07,297 --> 01:00:19,740
we had the opportunity to meet in the Bistro, so we were highlighting, we were in the Foundry Room, but we were highlighting, again, the wonderful assets that Medford Public Schools does have to offer.

709
01:00:21,541 --> 01:00:35,905
So some of the key things that Leslie is willing to offer to Medford Public Schools is both offering online and face-to-face professional development in areas of response to intervention, RTI,

710
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:40,251
mathematics and other content areas.

711
01:00:42,012 --> 01:00:52,636
They want to continue to work with us on finding ways to think about inclusive practices for not only our students, but staff and parents.

712
01:00:53,976 --> 01:01:05,020
Additionally, looking at additional professional development that could be offered for neighboring districts and using Medford as a potential site

713
01:01:05,631 --> 01:01:22,857
so that if it was something that they were offering to other schools, we would be able to benefit alongside some of our neighboring colleagues for courses that could help our teachers, again, have opportunities for excellent professional development.

714
01:01:25,397 --> 01:01:33,600
Stacey Schulman, our coordinator of clinical services, she's also rebooting our cell opportunities, so that's another piece.

715
01:01:34,618 --> 01:01:54,628
She'll be working collaboratively with Michael Skorka and Maureen Lavin as a district to help with our CEL opportunities, social-emotional learning, and Lesley University is also willing to offer workshops and support that work with us as well.

716
01:01:56,109 --> 01:01:56,690
Lastly,

717
01:01:58,230 --> 01:02:12,800
At the end of this month, I will be conducting some baseline learning walks with Lesley University, and they're going to be helping us look at math instruction at our four elementary schools.

718
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:23,907
And so what we would like to do is go in and just look at what math instruction looks like now in September, late September, early October.

719
01:02:24,609 --> 01:02:49,719
And then we will go back at a later point in the year, because as a district, we made an investment in having side-by-side math coaching at the elementary school levels, and working collaboratively with our math coordinator, Fajah Khan, as well, to improve math instruction for the entire district.

720
01:02:50,139 --> 01:02:52,320
So although Leslie is, you know,

721
01:02:52,761 --> 01:02:54,843
very famous for their work with literacy.

722
01:02:55,363 --> 01:03:01,588
They actually also are very excited about embarking on this journey with us.

723
01:03:02,489 --> 01:03:16,240
And Dr. Patricia Cren de la Galarce will be spearheading that work as we go and look at instruction to gather baseline information.

724
01:03:20,273 --> 01:03:21,014
Mr. Benedetto.

725
01:03:21,254 --> 01:03:21,614
Thank you.

726
01:03:22,114 --> 01:03:22,775
Thank you for this.

727
01:03:22,875 --> 01:03:28,979
I'm very happy to see the professional development opportunities for our teachers.

728
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:40,307
So when I met with the special education PAC leader over the summer, they're hoping to have a disability awareness program.

729
01:03:40,727 --> 01:03:47,452
And I didn't know if there was a possibility that Leslie may already have something that we could use.

730
01:03:48,226 --> 01:03:51,407
for our teaching staff or our community as a whole.

731
01:03:51,427 --> 01:04:00,730
And rather than create it from a lot of outside places, we can see, since we already have this partnership, if they already have something developed that we could share.

732
01:04:01,410 --> 01:04:11,533
I'm hoping to reach out to the other members of this subcommittee soon and see if we can make a meeting at that time, a meeting sometime soon.

733
01:04:12,233 --> 01:04:17,395
And I'm wondering if a liaison from Leslie, if they have

734
01:04:18,093 --> 01:04:19,794
anything could possibly attend?

735
01:04:20,834 --> 01:04:27,118
I will work with Dr. Patricia, because she's also the director of their Center for Special Education.

736
01:04:27,718 --> 01:04:31,600
So that is a wonderful connection there.

737
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:34,722
And we have already begun our partnership.

738
01:04:34,762 --> 01:04:40,284
So you can update me, and then I will continue to make that happen.

739
01:04:40,304 --> 01:04:47,188
We're still at the beginning basis and gathering information of what that program will look like and where we get it from to bring it in?

740
01:04:47,740 --> 01:05:02,307
So if Leslie already has some type of programming available and that we can utilize that without costing the district with this partnership, it would save us some money and time from looking and we can move forward on that.

741
01:05:03,748 --> 01:05:13,312
I'll talk to you directly more about it, but I think that these types of partnerships are gonna become very helpful for our community.

742
01:05:14,653 --> 01:05:15,013
Thank you.

743
01:05:16,387 --> 01:05:22,853
Yes, I guess I'm a little surprised to not see literacy actually as the focus here.

744
01:05:23,233 --> 01:05:35,303
More than half of our third graders are not able to read proficiently or even meet expectations on MCAS, and I'm not a fan of MCAS, but it's the last time we have publicly available data.

745
01:05:35,584 --> 01:05:42,450
And I mean, I know that my own kids, as they've gone through elementary school, the biggest and hardest thing,

746
01:05:43,505 --> 01:05:48,647
fairly certain every one of us has heard from parents who are like, what on earth is this math?

747
01:05:49,107 --> 01:05:54,489
And the key thing that I see when I see our math is that it's all words.

748
01:05:54,789 --> 01:05:56,950
It's all languages, language-based.

749
01:05:57,650 --> 01:06:07,953
And to expect kids to perform well on math when they're expected to be able to read, when that's their key weakness, to me is kind of putting the cart before the horse.

750
01:06:08,273 --> 01:06:12,755
And so while I know that the math scores last year caused

751
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:24,573
some concern, I just feel like that doesn't make sense to focus on the math scores because it's the reading that they are not, our kids are not readers.

752
01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:28,594
So I beg to differ about that assessment.

753
01:06:28,894 --> 01:06:33,296
I feel with the math, it is true that the new math right now is

754
01:06:34,741 --> 01:06:41,023
definitely there are a lot of literacy strategies that are there with the math problems.

755
01:06:41,543 --> 01:06:50,326
However, there are also still strong instructional practices that can happen in the area of math that were not being addressed.

756
01:06:51,486 --> 01:07:04,350
In speaking with Leslie and trying to do a partnership that was manageable, like one project that they would, because they're gonna be taking some of their professors

757
01:07:04,873 --> 01:07:09,115
to come offline to be available to gather the preliminary data.

758
01:07:10,836 --> 01:07:22,141
In order for them to do that, we could not be too broad and not be able to get enough information and do it well.

759
01:07:22,761 --> 01:07:31,525
So even in our conversations, especially my conversations with Dr. Patricia, we talked about

760
01:07:32,092 --> 01:07:41,859
in mathematics, the literacy that is present, which is one of the pieces that a lot of students have difficulty with, because there are so many words.

761
01:07:42,180 --> 01:07:53,728
And so we were talking about what are strategies which would end up including literacy strategies, but what are strategies that could be used, which could transfer over to math instruction.

762
01:07:54,149 --> 01:08:01,114
So we were talking about looking at best practices, but in order to come up with what we think

763
01:08:01,843 --> 01:08:05,325
could potentially be those best practices, we need to go in and see.

764
01:08:05,805 --> 01:08:16,551
So when I talked about listening, observing, and looking at it, and then coming up with an action plan, Leslie wants to be a partner with us, and they are willing to work with us.

765
01:08:17,192 --> 01:08:27,738
And so we wanted to just, we're, as a district, we were making a decision to focus on improving math instruction,

766
01:08:28,216 --> 01:08:34,579
but improving instruction in any content area, all of the other content areas will benefit as well.

767
01:08:34,999 --> 01:08:50,166
So the strategies that we can look at that are gonna happen in mathematics because there is so much literacy with the word problems, those skills can still be transferred over to science, to reading, to other content areas as well.

768
01:08:50,686 --> 01:08:56,969
So I don't want it to be like, oh, we're only looking at math and we're not looking at anything else.

769
01:08:57,477 --> 01:09:05,941
but the strategy was, as a district, we are a stronger performing district in literacy, in ELA.

770
01:09:06,422 --> 01:09:23,010
So that is our stronger muscle, and math has been our weaker side, so we're just trying to give some additional attention to math to build that muscle a little more, but we definitely are not going to ignore literacy.

771
01:09:23,530 --> 01:09:26,312
We're going to continue to keep a very, very close watch

772
01:09:26,937 --> 01:09:30,399
on how students are performing in ELA as well.

773
01:09:33,220 --> 01:09:36,602
I understand what you're saying, and it makes sense the way you describe it.

774
01:09:36,842 --> 01:09:47,868
I'm just not sure where the assessment that we're strong in literacy comes from, because all I have is the data on the website that any of us can look at.

775
01:09:48,688 --> 01:09:56,272
And while we are about on par with Massachusetts, and sure, if we compare ourselves to other states that don't do well in education, we look great.

776
01:09:57,873 --> 01:10:25,262
But if the assumption is that half the kids not being able to read adequately by the time they have to have learned third grade is somehow, you know, we're doing okay, I just, to me, like 95% proficient in reading by the end of third grade would probably be considered something I could say, well, we could work through the 5% other kids, maybe there's some other issue that, you know,

777
01:10:25,881 --> 01:10:28,141
special education or whatever needs to be involved.

778
01:10:28,241 --> 01:10:43,745
But 54% of our kids, or 55% of our kids are, the research that I'm seeing says if you're not a proficient reader by the time you're done with third grade, you will never be a proficient reader.

779
01:10:45,225 --> 01:10:48,286
And half of our kids are not proficient readers by the end of third grade.

780
01:10:48,506 --> 01:10:55,347
So, I mean, to expect them to run before they can walk

781
01:10:55,974 --> 01:10:59,916
That's definitely not my expectation.

782
01:11:00,457 --> 01:11:03,878
I think we have to look at where the children are developmentally.

783
01:11:04,299 --> 01:11:08,561
So third grade is the first time that students take a formalized assessment.

784
01:11:09,101 --> 01:11:17,806
So when you think about kindergarten, first grade, second grade, the foundations being set in third grade, that's the first time they take a formal assessment.

785
01:11:18,346 --> 01:11:19,587
So for some students,

786
01:11:20,249 --> 01:11:25,034
the stress of taking a standardized test in third grade, they are still young.

787
01:11:25,675 --> 01:11:31,622
And so third grade, although that's our baseline data, I still feel like the students need time.

788
01:11:31,962 --> 01:11:41,273
So if we look at our students' data over time, and you look at how they perform over time, starting in third grade, which we know is our baseline,

789
01:11:41,677 --> 01:11:49,782
year, all the way through high school, where you end up seeing significantly greater outcomes as the children get older.

790
01:11:50,322 --> 01:11:55,225
And again, thinking about our different populations at the elementary school levels.

791
01:11:55,785 --> 01:12:05,790
For English language learners, there is that silent phase, which I think I had talked about before, between five and seven years while they are acquiring the language.

792
01:12:06,091 --> 01:12:08,712
So they're not able to produce, they're not able to

793
01:12:09,428 --> 01:12:21,137
perform as well in the lower grades, but as they acquire the vocabulary and as they acquire greater academic language, the students are able to excel and they are able to do well.

794
01:12:21,657 --> 01:12:34,406
So although looking at the third grade numbers, you may be alarmed, I'm not so much alarmed about our performance in terms of how we are as a district in literacy.

795
01:12:34,906 --> 01:12:38,309
I was truly more concerned about the mathematics

796
01:12:38,745 --> 01:12:40,606
because the gap is getting wider.

797
01:12:41,406 --> 01:12:47,329
And in mathematics right now, one of the challenges is because there is so much language.

798
01:12:48,090 --> 01:12:53,813
And reading about math is not the same as just doing straight computation.

799
01:12:54,353 --> 01:13:07,380
So there's a different level of teaching that needs to go, that needs to take place in order for teachers to show students how to unpack the mathematical, like what is this word problem actually asking?

800
01:13:07,855 --> 01:13:10,858
because it's not something that you would normally do.

801
01:13:11,238 --> 01:13:16,562
So if students were just strictly working on algorithms, I believe they would be able to solve the algorithms.

802
01:13:16,923 --> 01:13:21,346
But once you add that word problem, all of a sudden, there is confusion.

803
01:13:21,366 --> 01:13:22,728
Am I being asked to add?

804
01:13:22,748 --> 01:13:24,089
Am I being asked to subtract?

805
01:13:24,489 --> 01:13:26,351
Am I going to multiply or divide?

806
01:13:26,731 --> 01:13:35,098
So that is the only reason why I was saying, let's take the strategy of focusing on the mathematics and the

807
01:13:36,159 --> 01:13:40,760
what students are getting tripped up with is around the word problems.

808
01:13:41,481 --> 01:13:48,963
And so by tackling that, although it's mathematics, we're also going to be addressing literacy at the same time.

809
01:13:50,923 --> 01:13:51,443
Just one more thing.

810
01:13:52,344 --> 01:14:00,326
So I mean, I know that the MCAS third grade reading is the only option we get on the Department of Ed's website to see anything about reading.

811
01:14:00,626 --> 01:14:01,446
Yes.

812
01:14:01,606 --> 01:14:04,287
And I also know that we do reading assessments

813
01:14:05,395 --> 01:14:07,275
and a lot more than just that one thing.

814
01:14:08,396 --> 01:14:14,117
Is it possible to get a report that shows how our kids are actually doing on reading other than that one snapshot?

815
01:14:15,197 --> 01:14:23,119
Because I know you all collect a gazillion, I mean, I've heard about these reading assessments and we're doing it all, but I don't have any way to ever see that, so.

816
01:14:24,320 --> 01:14:24,540
Yes.

817
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:25,200
Thank you.

818
01:14:25,380 --> 01:14:33,542
And that's also part of my learning phase, looking at the data that is available and then seeing what that data says.

819
01:14:34,255 --> 01:14:52,259
because again, the state assessment is only at the end of the year, and that is something that I've been talking a lot about with my associate superintendent, Diane Caldwell, about how we look at the data that's available to us, district-based data, and using that to inform instruction in our next steps.

820
01:14:52,879 --> 01:14:54,279
Thank you.

821
01:14:54,319 --> 01:15:03,721
So we do, on a regular basis, assess our students with instruments such as the journeys program that we adopted years ago.

822
01:15:04,315 --> 01:15:10,780
And within journeys, there's lots of different subtests that are diagnostic that our teachers utilize.

823
01:15:11,780 --> 01:15:18,445
They also use words their way and running records to do comprehension.

824
01:15:19,066 --> 01:15:28,993
So the best way to look at these reports is to assess the kids now, and then take a few months and maybe do it again in January, and then maybe at the end of the school year.

825
01:15:29,413 --> 01:15:31,614
So then you can see the progress that the children make.

826
01:15:31,695 --> 01:15:33,616
But we can certainly get you some information.

827
01:15:34,642 --> 01:15:36,943
Thank you.

828
01:15:36,963 --> 01:15:37,623
Mr. Benedetto.

829
01:15:38,143 --> 01:15:57,548
As chairsperson of the curriculum subcommittee, I'd like to move this item to subcommittee and have that meeting soon after the release of the MCAS so we can go over those district reports prior to them being discussed at our school committee meeting.

830
01:15:57,868 --> 01:16:03,029
I know that MCAS are released in December for last year, I mean October.

831
01:16:03,952 --> 01:16:21,122
So last year, so once those items are released, maybe we can incorporate all assessments and how we're looking at where children are and where, what our next steps are and go over that at a subcommittee meeting and have a bigger conversation since this seems like it's an important piece.

832
01:16:21,703 --> 01:16:26,045
So I motion to speak about this and that at a subcommittee meeting.

833
01:16:27,206 --> 01:16:29,027
Member Russo is also a member.

834
01:16:29,718 --> 01:16:32,919
And member Rogerio is also a member of that committee.

835
01:16:33,739 --> 01:16:37,460
So I'd like to move this item to subcommittee.

836
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:41,521
Just for clarity, we are not moving the report on Lesley University.

837
01:16:41,601 --> 01:16:47,563
We are reporting the issue of our, just to be clear, of our language achievement.

838
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:48,283
Yeah.

839
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:57,663
There's a motion to accept the Leslie partnership report, seconded by Ms.

840
01:16:57,703 --> 01:16:59,303
Stone.

841
01:17:00,424 --> 01:17:01,124
All those in favor?

842
01:17:01,424 --> 01:17:01,544
Aye.

843
01:17:01,764 --> 01:17:02,405
All those opposed?

844
01:17:02,445 --> 01:17:03,145
Motion passes.

845
01:17:03,205 --> 01:17:13,789
And on a B paper, that a paper be sent to the curriculum subcommittee to discuss the various ratings that will be coming out, whether it be MCAS and or some of the other

846
01:17:14,253 --> 01:17:16,815
testing that the school department does on an ongoing basis.

847
01:17:17,576 --> 01:17:19,677
On that motion, all those in favor?

848
01:17:20,318 --> 01:17:21,039
All those opposed?

849
01:17:21,679 --> 01:17:22,440
Motion passes.

850
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:25,261
Negotiations and legal matters.

851
01:17:25,302 --> 01:17:30,046
Approval of paraprofessional MOA for collective bargaining agreement 19 to 21.

852
01:17:30,606 --> 01:17:34,790
As you realize, last meeting we met in an executive session to discuss this contract.

853
01:17:35,171 --> 01:17:43,779
It has been ratified by the PARA's group and there's a motion hopefully on the floor, so we'll move a motion that we accept this contract.

854
01:17:44,699 --> 01:17:47,702
So moved by Mr. Russo, seconded by Mr. Benedetto.

855
01:17:47,722 --> 01:17:48,943
Roll call vote, Ms.

856
01:17:49,103 --> 01:17:49,584
Secretary.

857
01:18:00,065 --> 01:18:00,305
Yes.

858
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:03,266
Yes, seven in the affirmative, zero in the negative.

859
01:18:03,346 --> 01:18:06,306
The motion passes and the contract is ratified.

860
01:18:07,266 --> 01:18:13,508
Under new business, school committee resolution, be it resolved that the Medford School Committee express its sincere condolences to the family of Richard Chaney.

861
01:18:13,928 --> 01:18:18,448
Mr. Chaney was a former Medford public school student and a former Medford high school swim coach.

862
01:18:19,349 --> 01:18:26,230
I can't remember back in many years going into the pool area and not seeing Mr. Chaney there, sometimes with his little puppy.

863
01:18:27,277 --> 01:18:28,078
He will be missed.

864
01:18:28,418 --> 01:18:31,780
He also helped us out at Tufts Park pool when we were trying to open it.

865
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:33,361
He was a certified pool operator.

866
01:18:34,001 --> 01:18:36,323
So he always came to our rescue whenever we needed him.

867
01:18:36,383 --> 01:18:40,745
And he was very active, I believe, in the Somerville pool system over there.

868
01:18:40,845 --> 01:18:44,247
So if we could all rise for a moment of silence on the passing of Mr. Chaney.

869
01:18:56,012 --> 01:19:04,897
Also, if you just indulge me, if I can make an announcement, the city is taking up a collection for those that were impacted by the gas explosions in the Merrimack Valley.

870
01:19:04,977 --> 01:19:09,819
So all of our firehouses have boxes that are accepting any types of donations.

871
01:19:10,119 --> 01:19:14,542
There is a detailed list, if you need examples of what we're collecting, that's up on the website.

872
01:19:15,022 --> 01:19:24,447
But certainly it's toiletries, non-perishables, hand sanitizers, a big item, waters they would accept as well, and clothing, socks, things like that.

873
01:19:24,907 --> 01:19:31,610
I also know that CCSR is having a collection as well this week, and I'm not sure where is their collection happening.

874
01:19:32,210 --> 01:19:32,951
Mr. DeLiva?

875
01:19:36,552 --> 01:19:44,876
So the CCSR met Friday afternoon to discuss how that organization could help out with the relief.

876
01:19:46,116 --> 01:19:54,240
So we are having drop-offs actually at the main office, and we're storing it in the conference room off of my office because I can lock the door there, but we're also using

877
01:19:55,730 --> 01:19:59,933
depending on how many donations we get, the loading desert room off the loading dock area as well.

878
01:20:00,453 --> 01:20:02,715
But all donations can head over to the main office first.

879
01:20:03,755 --> 01:20:04,396
And the list is... Excellent.

880
01:20:04,416 --> 01:20:08,959
I believe on Friday they'll be driving the trucks up with the schools, the supplies from the schools.

881
01:20:08,979 --> 01:20:09,039
Yes.

882
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:13,162
And likewise, we will be probably taking some DPW trucks up there.

883
01:20:13,202 --> 01:20:13,582
Exactly.

884
01:20:14,933 --> 01:20:15,293
Thank you.

885
01:20:15,373 --> 01:20:22,260
And everyone that has reached out thus far, we do have some employees that live in that area that were impacted by this, so keep them in mind.

886
01:20:22,560 --> 01:20:29,907
I'm sure that you can reach out if you want to name someone that you can send some particular items to because they're desperately in need of goods.

887
01:20:31,468 --> 01:20:31,668
Ms.

888
01:20:31,688 --> 01:20:32,468
Mostone.

889
01:20:32,508 --> 01:20:36,969
The business, is it on the agenda?

890
01:20:39,030 --> 01:20:39,830
It should be coming out.

891
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:41,471
We received a draft just today.

892
01:20:42,151 --> 01:20:46,872
So the superintendent and I are going to review that and then we will go back and forth with them.

893
01:20:47,532 --> 01:20:52,093
And Lieutenant Covino was instrumental in working through that with us.

894
01:20:52,694 --> 01:20:55,274
So then we will be furnishing it to the school committee.

895
01:20:55,294 --> 01:20:58,035
A lot of that is confidential because it has to do with school security.

896
01:20:58,558 --> 01:21:00,720
So we'll determine it at that time.

897
01:21:00,760 --> 01:21:03,542
It has not been read yet.

898
01:21:08,866 --> 01:21:11,688
And the security issue from the budget had to do with Safe Haven.

899
01:21:11,728 --> 01:21:13,810
So we have it in hand, but it's draft.

900
01:21:13,910 --> 01:21:16,772
So it should be coming to you probably by the next meeting.

901
01:21:19,514 --> 01:21:20,154
Mr. Benedetto.

902
01:21:20,414 --> 01:21:24,938
Also, the other report that we received recently had some recommendations for the school district.

903
01:21:25,358 --> 01:21:27,680
So maybe they could be added to that committee meeting

904
01:21:28,543 --> 01:21:29,544
with Safe Haven's report.

905
01:21:29,564 --> 01:21:32,887
I think many of the items were already corrected and or adopted.

906
01:21:32,907 --> 01:21:36,590
I think it's the sign-in sheets that need to be upgraded.

907
01:21:36,730 --> 01:21:38,251
Right, I saw a few things.

908
01:21:39,212 --> 01:21:43,836
So maybe they could be added to that agenda of that subcommittee.

909
01:21:45,537 --> 01:21:46,678
On the motion that this
