Medford High School is a comprehensive high school that includes the Medford Vocational Technical High School as well.

00:00:11,356 --> 00:00:18,580
This means that our students can participate in our Career and Technical Education courses while attending their core academic courses as well.

00:00:19,461 --> 00:00:22,903
There was a time when both schools were separate, but now we are one school.

00:00:24,011 --> 00:00:26,932
Our enrollment at Medford High School averages 1,300 students.

For staff, including myself, there's a principal director at Medford Vocational Technical High School, three assistant principals, one assistant principal director at Medford Vocational Technical High School, 175 teachers, six guidance counselors, three adjustment school counselors, and two school psychologists.

00:00:45,299 --> 00:00:48,420
We also have many individual service providers as well.

00:00:49,813 --> 00:00:57,946
It is our goal at Medford High School to encourage and assist all students to become creative and critical thinkers with compassionate hearts who embrace global citizenship.

00:00:58,945 --> 00:01:04,286
As a community of lifelong learners, we collaborate and engage with each other to develop and realize our potential.

In an inclusive environment of physical safety and emotional security, Medford High School fosters diversity and dresses the needs of the whole child.
