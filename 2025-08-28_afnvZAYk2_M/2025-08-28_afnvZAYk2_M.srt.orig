Thank you.

Let's show the crowd.

[SPEAKER_11]: Right?

28
00:11:09,517 --> 00:11:10,237
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't sure.

29
00:11:10,257 --> 00:11:13,619
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought we were going to get a big thing.

30
00:11:13,639 --> 00:11:15,920
[SPEAKER_11]: I wasn't sure either.

31
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:23,904
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm also worried about... Doesn't everybody get to know their business?

32
00:11:23,964 --> 00:11:24,544
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

33
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:26,545
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you put a comment about this?

34
00:11:31,449 --> 00:11:33,751
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, he says, I thought it was your friend.

35
00:11:51,015 --> 00:11:58,060
[SPEAKER_11]: While we're waiting, can I ask everyone to please silence their phones?

36
00:12:19,915 --> 00:12:21,115
[SPEAKER_13]: including me for that matter.

37
00:12:21,135 --> 00:12:29,799
[SPEAKER_13]: And it also means no scrolling.

38
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:44,404
[SPEAKER_13]: All right, everybody, if you have a chair, please take a seat.

39
00:12:44,424 --> 00:12:47,565
[SPEAKER_13]: There's still a couple here and a couple over here.

40
00:12:50,421 --> 00:12:52,062
[SPEAKER_13]: Otherwise, I believe we're ready to get started.

41
00:12:53,262 --> 00:12:57,564
[SPEAKER_13]: Welcome tonight's candidate, a forum put on by the Medford Democratic City Committee.

42
00:12:58,285 --> 00:13:06,068
[SPEAKER_13]: Our intention was to invite all the candidates to share with the citizens of Medford who they are and why they are running for office.

43
00:13:06,648 --> 00:13:10,010
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm happy to announce that all the candidates expressed interest in attending.

44
00:13:12,471 --> 00:13:14,733
[SPEAKER_13]: Also, before we move on, I wanted to introduce myself.

45
00:13:14,873 --> 00:13:15,893
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is Bruce Kulik.

46
00:13:16,094 --> 00:13:22,678
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm co-chair of the Medford Democratic City Committee, along with Phyllis Morrison, who will also be our timekeeper tonight.

47
00:13:24,239 --> 00:13:29,623
[SPEAKER_13]: Unfortunately, George Scarpelli and Justin Tseng are unable to attend in person due to previous commitments.

48
00:13:30,383 --> 00:13:36,888
[SPEAKER_13]: Mr. Scarpelli sends his regrets, and Mr. Tseng has asked Jessica Attadio to represent him in his absence.

49
00:13:37,748 --> 00:13:45,092
[SPEAKER_13]: Additionally, Matt Lemming has indicated that he unfortunately needs to leave early, so if you see him bolt out, that's the reason for it.

50
00:13:46,633 --> 00:13:59,160
[SPEAKER_13]: This event is also being broadcast and recorded for later replay on the Medford Government Channel, which is 22 for Comcast and 43 for Verizon, and via YouTube live stream at YouTube at Medford Community Media 391.

51
00:14:01,201 --> 00:14:06,283
[SPEAKER_13]: We have also published a list of websites, Facebook and Instagram IDs supplied by the candidates.

52
00:14:06,844 --> 00:14:15,227
[SPEAKER_13]: There are cards distributed around the room with this information and a QR code to access the recording and Medford Democrat webpage directly.

53
00:14:16,728 --> 00:14:22,911
[SPEAKER_13]: Additionally, the Medford Democratic City Committee plans to hold additional forums in October before the general election.

54
00:14:23,391 --> 00:14:25,452
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll let everybody know when that's going to occur.

55
00:14:26,572 --> 00:14:31,756
[SPEAKER_13]: Before I continue, I'd like to acknowledge any non-municipal elected officials who are in attendance.

56
00:14:32,716 --> 00:14:33,877
[SPEAKER_13]: I didn't see anybody come in.

57
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:49,167
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm looking for non-municipal candidates and elected officials.

58
00:14:49,948 --> 00:14:50,108
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.

59
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,151
[SPEAKER_13]: Elections Commission.

60
00:14:54,211 --> 00:14:54,751
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay, thank you.

61
00:14:55,952 --> 00:14:56,772
[SPEAKER_13]: Anybody else?

62
00:14:57,433 --> 00:14:58,373
[SPEAKER_13]: I think we're all set with that.

63
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:05,378
[SPEAKER_13]: We will first introduce all the candidates, followed by each candidate speaking for up to three minutes.

64
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:11,523
[SPEAKER_13]: Any remaining time will be used to allow the audience to interact directly with the candidates on a one-to-one basis.

65
00:15:12,837 --> 00:15:18,882
[SPEAKER_13]: Due to the time limitations, there will be no questions asked to the candidates and no questions from the audience.

66
00:15:19,523 --> 00:15:22,686
[SPEAKER_13]: Please hold your applause until each candidate has finished their talk.

67
00:15:23,766 --> 00:15:27,850
[SPEAKER_13]: And with that, Phyllis will introduce the candidates and continue with the program.

68
00:15:31,155 --> 00:15:32,796
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi, everyone, and thanks for coming out.

69
00:15:32,837 --> 00:15:42,445
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a really important night for our city, and I'm particularly pleased that all of the candidates could be here in person or have sent a representative for themselves.

70
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:47,749
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, this is how we get to find out about the people who want to be our representatives in our city.

71
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:50,131
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you to all of the candidates.

72
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:52,574
[SPEAKER_09]: We really appreciate your participation in this.

73
00:15:53,314 --> 00:15:57,258
[SPEAKER_09]: I am going to apologize up front if I say your name incorrectly.

74
00:15:57,418 --> 00:15:58,559
[SPEAKER_09]: I am doing my best.

75
00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:12,632
[SPEAKER_09]: As I call your name, first I would like to say to you, prior to tonight's event, the Democratic City Committee held a lottery to determine the order in which the candidates would speak.

76
00:16:12,692 --> 00:16:13,733
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a random draw.

77
00:16:14,393 --> 00:16:17,955
[SPEAKER_09]: And the candidates, once we did that, the email was sent out to the candidates.

78
00:16:18,035 --> 00:16:19,095
[SPEAKER_09]: They knew their standing.

79
00:16:19,135 --> 00:16:20,856
[SPEAKER_09]: They knew the amount of time they would have.

80
00:16:20,936 --> 00:16:25,478
[SPEAKER_09]: They knew that there would be a warning when they had 20 seconds left to speak.

81
00:16:25,998 --> 00:16:31,101
[SPEAKER_09]: So I will go over those points for the candidates once I've introduced them all.

82
00:16:31,621 --> 00:16:36,643
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to call the candidates' name, and I'll ask them to stand, be recognized, and then be seated.

83
00:16:37,143 --> 00:16:39,144
[SPEAKER_09]: So Patrick Clerkin.

84
00:16:42,486 --> 00:16:43,366
[SPEAKER_09]: Nate Merritt.

85
00:16:45,844 --> 00:16:46,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Matt Lemming.

86
00:16:49,305 --> 00:16:52,126
[SPEAKER_09]: For Justin Sang, Jennifer Tadeo.

87
00:16:54,407 --> 00:16:55,127
[SPEAKER_09]: Liz Mullane.

88
00:16:57,447 --> 00:16:59,648
[SPEAKER_09]: George Scarpelli.

89
00:17:02,969 --> 00:17:03,929
[SPEAKER_09]: Anna Callahan.

90
00:17:06,750 --> 00:17:08,070
[SPEAKER_09]: Nicholas Juleo.

91
00:17:11,812 --> 00:17:13,112
[SPEAKER_09]: Miranda Beresno.

92
00:17:14,775 --> 00:17:15,675
[SPEAKER_09]: Did I say it correctly?

93
00:17:15,695 --> 00:17:16,356
[SPEAKER_09]: Briseno.

94
00:17:16,416 --> 00:17:16,976
[SPEAKER_09]: Briseno.

95
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:17,576
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

96
00:17:17,596 --> 00:17:18,257
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

97
00:17:19,157 --> 00:17:20,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Paige Boldini.

98
00:17:23,179 --> 00:17:24,300
[SPEAKER_09]: Rick Caraviello.

99
00:17:27,321 --> 00:17:28,882
[SPEAKER_09]: Paul J. Donato Jr.

100
00:17:31,443 --> 00:17:32,724
[SPEAKER_09]: Emily K. Lazzaro.

101
00:17:34,645 --> 00:17:36,666
[SPEAKER_09]: Well your name isn't next on the list.

102
00:17:36,686 --> 00:17:41,988
[SPEAKER_13]: I apologize.

103
00:17:47,312 --> 00:17:47,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Ms.

104
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:49,896
[SPEAKER_09]: Tringali, I am so sorry.

105
00:17:52,219 --> 00:17:53,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Emily Calazzaro.

106
00:17:55,144 --> 00:17:55,825
[SPEAKER_09]: Zach Beers.

107
00:17:58,408 --> 00:17:59,350
[SPEAKER_09]: Trish Ciappelli.

108
00:18:02,634 --> 00:18:03,516
[SPEAKER_09]: Melva McDonald.

109
00:18:06,746 --> 00:18:10,349
[SPEAKER_09]: So with that, what's going to happen now is I'm going to return to my seat.

110
00:18:10,469 --> 00:18:14,493
[SPEAKER_09]: I will call the person who is going to speak first, who is Patrick Clerking.

111
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:18,096
[SPEAKER_09]: Patrick, when I give you the go ahead, I'm going to ask you to start speaking.

112
00:18:18,116 --> 00:18:19,777
[SPEAKER_09]: When I start the timer, I'll give you that.

113
00:18:20,158 --> 00:18:22,460
[SPEAKER_09]: And at 20 seconds, as I've already shown all of you.

114
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,702
[SPEAKER_09]: This will be your morning.

115
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:27,365
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll raise it right from that seat so you can see it.

116
00:18:27,826 --> 00:18:29,187
[SPEAKER_09]: You will have 20 seconds left.

117
00:18:29,688 --> 00:18:36,175
[SPEAKER_09]: Because of the time constraint we have at the library, I am going to have to cut the candidates off at three minutes.

118
00:18:36,355 --> 00:18:40,239
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not trying to be rude, and the candidates were told about this prior to.

119
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,063
[SPEAKER_09]: Please note that there are no questions to be asked during this time frame.

120
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:50,386
[SPEAKER_09]: Any time we have left at the end, you can mingle with the candidates, and we hope there's time to do so.

121
00:18:50,786 --> 00:18:53,868
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you once again for coming, and I'm going to take my seat.

122
00:18:54,328 --> 00:18:56,810
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to call Patrick Clerkin to the podium.

123
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:16,843
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, everyone.

124
00:19:17,084 --> 00:19:17,884
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm Patrick Clerkin.

125
00:19:18,545 --> 00:19:24,690
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm going to start off with a little bit of my backstory, and then I'm going to get into why it's relevant and what I'd like to do for Medford.

126
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,791
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm a mechanical engineer.

127
00:19:27,051 --> 00:19:33,136
[SPEAKER_17]: I've worked in both a corporate context as an employee and as a contractor.

128
00:19:33,897 --> 00:19:35,298
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've also been an entrepreneur.

129
00:19:35,698 --> 00:19:37,900
[SPEAKER_17]: And most recently, I've worked as a handyman.

130
00:19:38,521 --> 00:19:44,846
[SPEAKER_17]: And with the handyman work, it's been a lot of meeting neighbors, getting out there, and a lot of practical hands-on stuff.

131
00:19:45,776 --> 00:19:52,442
[SPEAKER_17]: combining the street smarts and the book smarts and the abstract and the physical hands-on stuff.

132
00:19:52,983 --> 00:20:02,431
[SPEAKER_17]: So I have also been involved with a lot of different civic organizations, both as a member and as a leader within those organizations.

133
00:20:02,851 --> 00:20:10,138
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of them have been Habitat for Humanity, Big Brother Big Sister, American Red Cross, and the board of my fraternity.

134
00:20:10,565 --> 00:20:17,328
[SPEAKER_17]: So I wanna bring all of those perspectives and experiences to my efforts here in Medford for the city's benefit.

135
00:20:17,988 --> 00:20:22,630
[SPEAKER_17]: And what I wanted to focus on in particular was robust community.

136
00:20:23,110 --> 00:20:26,811
[SPEAKER_17]: And how I see it, community is both communications and unity.

137
00:20:27,611 --> 00:20:36,775
[SPEAKER_17]: And in 2023, when I ran for the first time, what I saw was that the city has so many resources and there's no hub of communications anymore.

138
00:20:37,107 --> 00:20:45,375
[SPEAKER_17]: There used to be a paper, there isn't anymore, there's some new things, but basically there's not a dashboard or there's not a consistent reference that people are consulting.

139
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:51,801
[SPEAKER_17]: And when you don't have that, it causes anger and fear and distrust and confusion to proliferate.

140
00:20:52,682 --> 00:20:56,646
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I have a bunch of different ideas as to how to practically address that.

141
00:20:57,053 --> 00:21:02,339
[SPEAKER_17]: They're on my website, I can't get into all of them right now, so I recommend that you consult my website for those.

142
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:17,137
[SPEAKER_17]: But I will say, if you want a practical example as to how lack of communications negatively affects the city, look at the current zoning issue, how a lot of the people feel that this information has been dropped on them at the last minute, they feel like things have already been decided.

143
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:23,638
[SPEAKER_17]: they feel like basically the neighborhoods aren't getting a say in this citywide process.

144
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:37,143
[SPEAKER_17]: The other aspect of what I wanted to focus on was unity, and I'm already embodying that democracy within my campaign where I've gone to all 16, canvassed all 16 precincts.

145
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:43,666
[SPEAKER_17]: I've crossed demographic, geographic, partisan, ideological lines, talked to anyone, I don't care what,

146
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:46,514
[SPEAKER_17]: what flag you have in your yard, what letter you have next to your name.

147
00:21:46,614 --> 00:21:51,495
[SPEAKER_17]: I want everyone to be involved in this process, and I am actively doing that.

148
00:21:51,796 --> 00:22:04,220
[SPEAKER_17]: So the last thing that I'll say is that I'm focused on independent thinking, on practical solutions, on Medford in its entirety, and on local issues.

149
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:11,282
[SPEAKER_17]: So I would be a counselor at large for Medford, not for Massachusetts, not for the United States, not for the world.

150
00:22:11,382 --> 00:22:13,723
[SPEAKER_17]: So if these are values that you appreciate,

151
00:22:14,504 --> 00:22:17,945
[SPEAKER_17]: please vote for me on September 16th and on November 4th.

152
00:22:18,245 --> 00:22:18,505
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.

153
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:30,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Nate, would you like to come to the podium?

154
00:22:30,369 --> 00:22:30,829
[SPEAKER_09]: Nate Merritt.

155
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:10,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, I'm Nate Merritt, and I'm asking for your vote to represent all of Medford as your next city councilor.

156
00:23:10,995 --> 00:23:13,876
[SPEAKER_04]: And I swear I do own a tie, sorry about not wearing that tonight.

157
00:23:14,836 --> 00:23:18,017
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm running because I think we can get the city on a much better path than it is today.

158
00:23:18,577 --> 00:23:19,957
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm an engineer, I fix things.

159
00:23:20,617 --> 00:23:23,498
[SPEAKER_04]: I also help people, I was an EMT and a firefighter for many years.

160
00:23:24,118 --> 00:23:31,959
[SPEAKER_04]: In fact, last month when I walked into Tanook, and I found a child bleeding from the back of his head, I decided to step up and help, because that's what people do.

161
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,340
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did, and I'm willing to do it in a larger role.

162
00:23:35,489 --> 00:23:35,809
[SPEAKER_04]: Why me?

163
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Why not these fine folks?

164
00:23:37,952 --> 00:23:39,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I'm going to stay laser-focused on Medford.

165
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:43,058
[SPEAKER_04]: Not national, not state issues, Medford.

166
00:23:43,118 --> 00:23:44,259
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the job at hand.

167
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:56,213
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe if we took all these meetings and this negative energy that's been going on to ODARC 30 in the morning, trying to relitigate international foreign conflicts and trade embargoes,

168
00:23:56,713 --> 00:24:05,038
[SPEAKER_04]: and instead focused it maybe on Riverside Ave and the Anheuser-Busch property, which now the MBTA picked up, then maybe we wouldn't be 600,000 in the hole.

169
00:24:05,479 --> 00:24:08,400
[SPEAKER_04]: We just passed an override for 500,000 to fix our streets.

170
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,441
[SPEAKER_04]: So who's gonna make it up?

171
00:24:09,461 --> 00:24:10,782
[SPEAKER_04]: And the answer is all of us.

172
00:24:11,502 --> 00:24:12,203
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not good.

173
00:24:12,483 --> 00:24:13,744
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a recipe for success.

174
00:24:15,112 --> 00:24:18,174
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to try to capitalize on the things that the city of Medford has.

175
00:24:18,194 --> 00:24:18,934
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not Cambridge.

176
00:24:19,314 --> 00:24:20,555
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Interstate 93.

177
00:24:20,795 --> 00:24:21,815
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got the Mystic River.

178
00:24:21,995 --> 00:24:23,036
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a lot of resources.

179
00:24:23,076 --> 00:24:27,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's use it and not try to turn this into the next 15-minute city like the socialist playbook.

180
00:24:29,139 --> 00:24:32,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's stop the nonsense of saying single-family homes are a thing of the past.

181
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:32,621
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not.

182
00:24:32,961 --> 00:24:39,244
[SPEAKER_04]: The city of Lowell, which is twice the population of Medford, has plenty of single-family zoning, and I think we can too.

183
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:43,528
[SPEAKER_04]: So in fact, that's what draws people to Medford, including me and my family.

184
00:24:44,428 --> 00:24:45,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take a smart look at zoning.

185
00:24:46,349 --> 00:24:47,329
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't an emergency.

186
00:24:47,369 --> 00:24:52,770
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty qualified to tell that being a former firefighter in EMT, we can take our time like we did with the charter review.

187
00:24:53,431 --> 00:24:54,131
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not emergency.

188
00:24:54,151 --> 00:24:58,172
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do it right the first time and not try to be like the Titanic going into an iceberg.

189
00:24:59,823 --> 00:25:01,584
[SPEAKER_04]: I want places in Medford for kids to play.

190
00:25:01,604 --> 00:25:04,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got two Bambinos, and especially in the wintertime, where do you bring them?

191
00:25:04,725 --> 00:25:05,465
[SPEAKER_04]: We go somewhere else.

192
00:25:05,485 --> 00:25:07,766
[SPEAKER_04]: You go to Jordan's, you go to Malden, you go everywhere else.

193
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:10,887
[SPEAKER_04]: I want people from Assembly Row to come here and bring their kids.

194
00:25:11,348 --> 00:25:13,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a sky zone, bigger than that.

195
00:25:13,468 --> 00:25:15,009
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a place to fly indoor drones.

196
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:16,169
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of things we could do.

197
00:25:16,510 --> 00:25:22,232
[SPEAKER_04]: But if our zoning, we take up every commercial spot and turn it into mixed-use residential, you're never going to have a spot for that.

198
00:25:22,712 --> 00:25:25,576
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the city needs some balance and we need to restore some balance.

199
00:25:26,017 --> 00:25:27,238
[SPEAKER_04]: Industrial and commercial is good.

200
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:31,163
[SPEAKER_04]: It helps pay for our roads, our public safety.

201
00:25:31,884 --> 00:25:35,429
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think with your vote, we can move the city forward together.

202
00:25:36,130 --> 00:25:36,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's make it happen.

203
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:37,572
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

204
00:25:53,901 --> 00:25:58,144
[SPEAKER_15]: First, I'd like to thank the Democratic City Committee for hosting this event.

205
00:25:58,184 --> 00:25:59,185
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Matt Lemming.

206
00:25:59,345 --> 00:26:04,009
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm a scientist, a naval officer, and for the past two years, a city councilor in Medford.

207
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:11,034
[SPEAKER_15]: I grew up in a military family, moved around a lot, did my PhD in the UK, and moved to Medford as a postdoc at Mass General.

208
00:26:11,294 --> 00:26:15,578
[SPEAKER_15]: When I moved here, I could barely pay for a room in a small apartment.

209
00:26:15,618 --> 00:26:19,681
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, that's not because brain disease research is not valuable.

210
00:26:19,701 --> 00:26:23,024
[SPEAKER_15]: It's because something about the system is deeply flawed.

211
00:26:23,644 --> 00:26:24,944
[SPEAKER_15]: In the past 30 years, U.S.

212
00:26:25,024 --> 00:26:33,026
[SPEAKER_15]: rents have risen 323 percent, average home prices 441 percent, and median household income a mere 37 percent.

213
00:26:33,146 --> 00:26:36,687
[SPEAKER_15]: And to even begin addressing this, we need to start locally.

214
00:26:36,967 --> 00:26:46,070
[SPEAKER_15]: So in 2023, after lobbying council to pass an affordable housing trust, I ran for council myself, talked to a whole lot of people, and began serving in 2024.

215
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:54,985
[SPEAKER_15]: Our state has laws that prevent city budgets from keeping up with inflation and Medford has stagnated in its growth for a long time.

216
00:26:55,105 --> 00:26:59,547
[SPEAKER_15]: So Medford has a budget problem and Medford's housing is too expensive.

217
00:27:00,227 --> 00:27:07,951
[SPEAKER_15]: This past term, I and many of my colleagues on council have stopped kicking the can down the road and backed by many parents and young families in the community.

218
00:27:08,372 --> 00:27:17,356
[SPEAKER_15]: We put on the ballot and campaign for our city's first ever 2.5 override, which staved 40 union jobs in the Medford Teachers Association and funded a full-time road repair crew.

219
00:27:18,477 --> 00:27:25,299
[SPEAKER_15]: This past term council approved new public housing for seniors and I'm working at the state and local level to fund our new affordable housing trust.

220
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:34,262
[SPEAKER_15]: The city and the community spent years developing plans to rezone the city both to address our affordability crisis and dwindling budget and council is working on that.

221
00:27:35,182 --> 00:27:36,384
[SPEAKER_15]: Our current zoning is patchwork.

222
00:27:36,424 --> 00:27:37,665
[SPEAKER_15]: It leads to patchwork development.

223
00:27:37,705 --> 00:27:41,149
[SPEAKER_15]: It needs to change, and it's needed to change for a very long time.

224
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:54,665
[SPEAKER_15]: New zoning will mitigate traffic via transportation and management program, mandate greener building practices, and with an historic conversion ordinance, maintain the many historic buildings that compose Medford, all while incentivizing housing affordability.

225
00:27:56,150 --> 00:28:05,602
[SPEAKER_15]: I've made Council a more transparent body by instituting a City Council newsletter, live-streaming our meetings, holding office hours at the Medford Senior Center, and writing about all of it non-stop on my website.

226
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:15,995
[SPEAKER_15]: I instituted a first-of-its-kind program to house low-income veterans, and I passed a law that will allow Medford residents to voluntarily donate to an in-need veterans fund on their tax bills.

227
00:28:16,555 --> 00:28:28,082
[SPEAKER_15]: In January, council passed a welcoming city ordinance, and in my work with the Democratic City Committee, I spearheaded a campaign to inform non-English-speaking residents of their constitutional rights in these very dire times.

228
00:28:29,427 --> 00:28:32,509
[SPEAKER_15]: In short, Council has at long last stopped kicking the can down the road.

229
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:35,631
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to take action if we're to have an affordable and vibrant city.

230
00:28:35,671 --> 00:28:39,813
[SPEAKER_15]: I've been putting in the work to do just that, and I will continue to put in the work.

231
00:28:40,293 --> 00:28:43,976
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much for your time and attention, and don't forget to vote on September 16th.

232
00:29:03,413 --> 00:29:03,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

233
00:29:04,634 --> 00:29:05,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, everyone.

234
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:12,323
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Jessica Taddeo, and as a longtime friend and colleague of Councilor Singh, I'm very honored to be sharing these remarks on his behalf tonight.

235
00:29:13,983 --> 00:29:16,966
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Justin Tsang, and I am honored to be your city councilor.

236
00:29:17,747 --> 00:29:23,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the son of immigrants who came to Medford chasing the American dream, looking to make strides in finding the cure for cancer.

237
00:29:24,775 --> 00:29:27,778
[SPEAKER_02]: My parents stretched their dollars and raised me paycheck to paycheck.

238
00:29:28,178 --> 00:29:32,303
[SPEAKER_02]: And without our schools, our neighbors in this community, that dream would not be possible.

239
00:29:32,803 --> 00:29:36,027
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I've worked these past four years to give back and pay it forward.

240
00:29:36,964 --> 00:29:44,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, as national politicians gamble with our economy and threaten the safety of our neighbors, Medford needs steady hands and bold leadership.

241
00:29:45,952 --> 00:29:48,593
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll always stand up for you because Medford stood up for me.

242
00:29:49,393 --> 00:29:52,654
[SPEAKER_02]: And over these past four years, we haven't just made progress, we've made history.

243
00:29:53,254 --> 00:30:02,538
[SPEAKER_02]: While some leaders are focused on turning our neighbors against one another, Medford is leading by example as a city that makes historic investments in our public schools and supports all of its residents.

244
00:30:03,238 --> 00:30:09,080
[SPEAKER_02]: We protected the freedoms of our neighbors with the Gender Affirming and Reproductive Healthcare Ordinance, which I worked on with Councilor Lozaro.

245
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:15,164
[SPEAKER_02]: and I codified the city's policy of non-cooperation with ICE in non-criminal cases to protect our immigrant neighbors.

246
00:30:15,744 --> 00:30:27,713
[SPEAKER_02]: We have taken bold steps to fight climate change and protect our green spaces, securing millions in funding to modernize and revitalize parks across the city, increasing accessibility for disabled residents, and offering amenities for all ages.

247
00:30:28,413 --> 00:30:33,539
[SPEAKER_02]: We're fixing sidewalks and streets that haven't been touched in decades and bringing back bus routes that our families rely on.

248
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:44,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Additionally, I've been working with my colleagues to make City Hall more transparent and accessible with new newsletters, more listening sessions, constituent services in different languages, and the list continues to grow.

249
00:30:44,981 --> 00:30:57,651
[SPEAKER_02]: While politicians in Washington and up on Beacon Hill continue to cater to their rich donors, we've passed once-in-a-generation reforms to make housing more affordable, increase local business growth, and lead the fight against climate change right here in our backyard.

250
00:30:58,412 --> 00:31:03,757
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I've talked to neighbors from all corners of life, I truly believe that there is more that unites us than divides us.

251
00:31:04,477 --> 00:31:09,701
[SPEAKER_02]: I know too many people are feeling the crunch, tired of seeing rents rise and dream of home ownership slip away.

252
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:15,210
[SPEAKER_02]: They're tired of seeing their kids and my classmates move because they can't afford to live here anymore.

253
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:19,958
[SPEAKER_02]: They're tired of having to choose between paying rent or for child care or for pest mitigation.

254
00:31:20,891 --> 00:31:25,074
[SPEAKER_02]: The truth is the status quo isn't working and doing more of the same isn't an option.

255
00:31:25,735 --> 00:31:37,203
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't get me wrong, this will be hard, and we should be wary of those simply playing politics over simplifying complex problems in the form of flashy sound bites, further perpetuating us versus them attitudes.

256
00:31:37,764 --> 00:31:44,549
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you really take a moment to sift through all of that noise, we can focus on our shared goals, making Medford

257
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:54,190
[SPEAKER_02]: making Bedford more affordable, ensuring we hold big developers accountable in our institutions to fight against displacement.

258
00:31:54,631 --> 00:31:56,033
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I'm running for re-election.

259
00:31:57,334 --> 00:31:57,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

260
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:14,260
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you to Phyllis, Bruce, and the Medford Democratic City Committee for organizing tonight's event.

261
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,660
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Liz Mullane.

262
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,322
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm an Assistant Vice President of Advancement at Northeastern University.

263
00:32:19,902 --> 00:32:25,984
[SPEAKER_12]: And in that role, I oversee six different teams within our department, which includes parents, planned giving, athletics, and the library.

264
00:32:26,685 --> 00:32:34,988
[SPEAKER_12]: Since 2020, I've been an adjunct faculty member at Northeastern's graduate nonprofit management program, instructing adult learners on how to build a nonprofit business.

265
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:45,794
[SPEAKER_12]: I have been in the industry for over 20-plus years with one of my first jobs at EMILY's List, an organization that raises money for pro-choice Democratic women running for office.

266
00:32:46,475 --> 00:33:03,402
[SPEAKER_12]: Since then, I've continued to work within organizations reviewing budgets and creating revenue streams for a variety of issue areas, like need-based scholarships for students, medical advancements for Alzheimer's and other autoimmune diseases, and capital funding for community-based needs around mental health and the library.

267
00:33:04,162 --> 00:33:10,467
[SPEAKER_12]: In each of these situations, I have successfully raised funds through individual, foundation, corporate, federal, and government grant outreach.

268
00:33:11,328 --> 00:33:20,315
[SPEAKER_12]: As a consultant to nonprofits, I also witnessed the need for further education around budgeting, financial management, and strategic planning, so I went back to school to receive my MBA.

269
00:33:21,056 --> 00:33:24,839
[SPEAKER_12]: I moved to Medford in 2018, where I was a renter until we purchased our home here.

270
00:33:25,419 --> 00:33:28,722
[SPEAKER_12]: Along with my husband and our two dogs, Medford is where we plan on staying.

271
00:33:29,870 --> 00:33:38,254
[SPEAKER_12]: I have been involved with the Medford Democratic City Committee and serving as the Ward 2 Chair for the past few years, trying to get more individuals involved in the local political process.

272
00:33:38,955 --> 00:33:44,037
[SPEAKER_12]: I was compelled to join the City Council race after witnessing areas in Medford that needed addressing.

273
00:33:44,637 --> 00:33:50,961
[SPEAKER_12]: Numerous accidents due to lack of pedestrian signage, poorly kept streets, and sidewalks that have become hard to navigate.

274
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:55,623
[SPEAKER_12]: With budgetary issues being a top concern and a lack of proper funding to some of our

275
00:33:56,083 --> 00:34:02,585
[SPEAKER_12]: more important community services, I felt both my professional background coupled with my education would bring a different skill set to the city.

276
00:34:03,405 --> 00:34:11,668
[SPEAKER_12]: If elected, I plan to champion for a continued transparent budgeting process with clear updates on how funds are being used, allocated, and distributed.

277
00:34:12,468 --> 00:34:25,957
[SPEAKER_12]: to review how the city approaches funding, and to help find new and creative ways to generate revenue, especially for our community services, Likert Library, senior care, and mental health staffing, all of which I have successfully done in my professional career.

278
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:32,748
[SPEAKER_12]: Incentivize and streamline the process for small businesses to enter Medford, which would only help to grow our commercial tack base.

279
00:34:33,408 --> 00:34:43,214
[SPEAKER_12]: As a dog owner and with no backyard, focus on improved sidewalks and streets and more green space by proactively working on the 2026 Medford Open Space and Recreation Plan.

280
00:34:43,974 --> 00:35:02,639
[SPEAKER_12]: continue to support the Affordable Housing Trust to make housing more affordable in Medford through linkage fees and fundraising initiatives, complete a pedestrian safety audit across the city to ensure a more walkable Medford, and to continue providing funding and support of the Medford public school system, which is imperative for our entire community's ongoing success.

281
00:35:03,299 --> 00:35:11,142
[SPEAKER_12]: I've enjoyed meeting so many Medford residents through this process, and I remain a listening ear to anyone who wants to discuss these issues or any other concerns.

282
00:35:11,662 --> 00:35:11,922
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.

283
00:35:20,682 --> 00:35:23,064
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you so much for hosting this and thank you all for being here.

284
00:35:23,104 --> 00:35:26,247
[SPEAKER_18]: My name is Anna Callahan and I am a first term incumbent.

285
00:35:26,727 --> 00:35:29,589
[SPEAKER_18]: I am really proud of the things that we did this term.

286
00:35:29,990 --> 00:35:33,032
[SPEAKER_18]: We took many steps to stabilize our city's budget.

287
00:35:33,933 --> 00:35:38,817
[SPEAKER_18]: We really worked on our rodent problems, enabling our staff to be able to take more actions.

288
00:35:39,677 --> 00:35:40,458
[SPEAKER_18]: to rein those in.

289
00:35:41,018 --> 00:35:49,725
[SPEAKER_18]: We did a number of things to protect our residents from the Trump administration, and we've taken steps toward more affordable housing and affordability in our city.

290
00:35:50,366 --> 00:36:01,695
[SPEAKER_18]: And you can count on me to be a vote in favor of what I believe are the values that we share here in Medford, and that includes

291
00:36:02,195 --> 00:36:03,836
[SPEAKER_18]: affordability and affordable housing.

292
00:36:04,157 --> 00:36:06,558
[SPEAKER_18]: It includes environment and climate change.

293
00:36:06,879 --> 00:36:09,200
[SPEAKER_18]: It includes being a more inclusive city.

294
00:36:10,461 --> 00:36:17,547
[SPEAKER_18]: But today, I want to highlight for you the things that make me unique as a city councilor.

295
00:36:18,347 --> 00:36:25,313
[SPEAKER_18]: And that really is in the question of democracy and engaging people in the political process.

296
00:36:26,253 --> 00:36:36,100
[SPEAKER_18]: I take it very seriously that 90 or 95% of the people who live in Medford will never come to a city council meeting and they will never reach out to their city councilors.

297
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:45,527
[SPEAKER_18]: So I take it upon myself to spend my time and effort in going into the community and listening to those people so that they have a voice.

298
00:36:46,347 --> 00:36:53,552
[SPEAKER_18]: I currently have five different teams of volunteers who help me with different parts of my city councilorship.

299
00:36:54,112 --> 00:36:59,236
[SPEAKER_18]: The first one, and by the way, if anybody here wants to be on one of these teams, please do let me know.

300
00:36:59,256 --> 00:37:03,159
[SPEAKER_18]: The first one is what I call my legislative team.

301
00:37:03,279 --> 00:37:09,002
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a group of people who meets with me before every city council meeting, and we go through every item on the agenda.

302
00:37:09,343 --> 00:37:10,523
[SPEAKER_18]: They do a lot of research.

303
00:37:10,564 --> 00:37:12,485
[SPEAKER_18]: They'll reach out to other members of the community.

304
00:37:13,466 --> 00:37:16,329
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a great way to really level up people who already are active.

305
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:19,673
[SPEAKER_18]: The second team I call my democracy team.

306
00:37:20,674 --> 00:37:25,460
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a group of people that helps me to set up listening sessions throughout the community.

307
00:37:25,921 --> 00:37:31,487
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes they're based on a policy, sometimes they're based on a demographic group, sometimes they're just in a neighborhood.

308
00:37:32,568 --> 00:37:34,890
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I have three different policy teams.

309
00:37:36,011 --> 00:37:41,375
[SPEAKER_18]: One of those is around trees because we plant less than half as many trees each year as we lose.

310
00:37:41,876 --> 00:37:54,465
[SPEAKER_18]: So we are organizing, we're gonna be organizing with the city to have events where big groups of neighbors come together to plant trees in our most barren neighborhoods.

311
00:37:55,486 --> 00:37:58,830
[SPEAKER_18]: The second one, the other two are around housing and housing affordability.

312
00:38:00,092 --> 00:38:05,338
[SPEAKER_18]: One is a group of people that came to me and were interested in getting co-housing here in Medford.

313
00:38:05,778 --> 00:38:10,484
[SPEAKER_18]: And the last one is around home sharing, which is really enabling people to age in place.

314
00:38:11,204 --> 00:38:14,348
[SPEAKER_18]: So if anyone's interested in working with me, please let me know.

315
00:38:14,568 --> 00:38:15,970
[SPEAKER_18]: And I really appreciate you all being here.

316
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:31,890
[SPEAKER_16]: Hi, everyone.

317
00:38:31,970 --> 00:38:32,651
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm Nick Giurleo.

318
00:38:32,691 --> 00:38:33,591
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you all for being here.

319
00:38:33,972 --> 00:38:35,293
[SPEAKER_16]: Just a little bit about my background.

320
00:38:35,613 --> 00:38:43,818
[SPEAKER_16]: I grew up in Medford, lived here my whole life, went to Medford High School, graduated number one in my class, and decided to stick around for college, and ended up going to Tufts University.

321
00:38:44,319 --> 00:38:45,319
[SPEAKER_16]: Great education there.

322
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:49,422
[SPEAKER_16]: And after that, I decided to work for a little bit.

323
00:38:49,722 --> 00:38:52,024
[SPEAKER_16]: I ended up working here in the square, actually, for a law office.

324
00:38:52,084 --> 00:38:55,966
[SPEAKER_16]: Really got interested in law through that experience, and decided I would go to law school.

325
00:38:56,006 --> 00:38:58,148
[SPEAKER_16]: So I went to law school, ended up at BC Law.

326
00:38:58,743 --> 00:39:03,924
[SPEAKER_16]: Graduated from BC Law, became an attorney, and that's what I do today, work for a great firm in downtown Boston.

327
00:39:04,665 --> 00:39:07,786
[SPEAKER_16]: Just one little brief thing about here, about why am I running, right?

328
00:39:07,866 --> 00:39:08,446
[SPEAKER_16]: Why am I running?

329
00:39:08,906 --> 00:39:11,807
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm running because being civically involved is really important for me.

330
00:39:12,267 --> 00:39:13,067
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to be involved.

331
00:39:13,147 --> 00:39:18,569
[SPEAKER_16]: It's important to not complain when you have problems with what's going on in the city, but to take a step forward and do something about that.

332
00:39:18,969 --> 00:39:23,030
[SPEAKER_16]: So I decided I needed to step forward and do something about the things that concern me.

333
00:39:23,610 --> 00:39:27,531
[SPEAKER_16]: So two issues that I just want to talk to you about in my very brief time here.

334
00:39:27,871 --> 00:39:30,952
[SPEAKER_16]: Number one, that's been central to my campaign, affordability.

335
00:39:31,372 --> 00:39:34,912
[SPEAKER_16]: Medford is, as everyone probably knows, an increasingly unaffordable place to live.

336
00:39:34,992 --> 00:39:41,014
[SPEAKER_16]: Long-time residents feel pressured out of their homes, and residents who want to move here feel like they can't because of barriers.

337
00:39:41,194 --> 00:39:42,334
[SPEAKER_16]: So what can we do about that?

338
00:39:42,354 --> 00:39:46,875
[SPEAKER_16]: In my opinion, the main reason for unaffordability is just the burden that residents have.

339
00:39:47,235 --> 00:39:51,976
[SPEAKER_16]: in meeting our spending needs, primarily through property taxes, which is where we get the majority of our revenue.

340
00:39:52,316 --> 00:40:00,539
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we can be smarter, though, and take that burden off them and shift it into areas like commercial, bringing businesses to Medford and also preserving our commercial tax base.

341
00:40:00,559 --> 00:40:06,140
[SPEAKER_16]: The commercial tax rate is nearly double the residential, so we get significant revenue through that.

342
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:07,220
[SPEAKER_16]: That's one issue.

343
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:16,263
[SPEAKER_16]: The other issue here is transparency, and for me, that primarily means council accessibility, so allowing the city council to be a resource that everybody can use.

344
00:40:16,729 --> 00:40:19,970
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's a lot of problems in terms of accessibility that we have to do something about.

345
00:40:20,470 --> 00:40:33,475
[SPEAKER_16]: Very late running meetings, last minute agenda changes, getting very off topic often with the agenda items, as well as reductions in the public speaking time at the expense of hearing people's opinions.

346
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:37,357
[SPEAKER_16]: So I think we can do simple things like change the rules of our city council.

347
00:40:37,717 --> 00:40:38,938
[SPEAKER_16]: to make it more accessible.

348
00:40:39,038 --> 00:40:40,999
[SPEAKER_16]: And also, I'm interested in information, too.

349
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,200
[SPEAKER_16]: Public information.

350
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,581
[SPEAKER_16]: Voters should be informed.

351
00:40:43,601 --> 00:40:44,862
[SPEAKER_16]: They have a right to be informed.

352
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:54,909
[SPEAKER_16]: What can we do to make public records more accessible to our citizens, honoring requests, and making sure people don't feel left out, people don't feel that communications are lacking?

353
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:57,190
[SPEAKER_16]: So these are two issues central to my campaign.

354
00:40:57,811 --> 00:41:00,673
[SPEAKER_16]: Again, I thank you all for being here, and I would very much appreciate your vote.

355
00:41:00,773 --> 00:41:01,033
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you.

356
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:11,694
[SPEAKER_16]: There we go, yeah.

357
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:20,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Testing, okay.

358
00:41:22,901 --> 00:41:23,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Good evening, everyone.

359
00:41:23,821 --> 00:41:25,042
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Miranda Berseno.

360
00:41:25,622 --> 00:41:33,427
[SPEAKER_06]: I love calling Medford home, and I'm running for city council to make sure that City Hall delivers better for residents of all ages, wages, and backgrounds.

361
00:41:34,885 --> 00:41:41,769
[SPEAKER_06]: We deserve a Medford that invests robustly in the public places that keep us connected to each other, like our schools, parks, and library.

362
00:41:42,509 --> 00:41:44,650
[SPEAKER_06]: We deserve a library that is open seven days a week.

363
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:47,872
[SPEAKER_06]: We deserve a Medford with plenty of shade trees and green space.

364
00:41:49,332 --> 00:41:54,515
[SPEAKER_06]: As a renter, I felt firsthand how hard it is to afford to remain here amid the skyrocketing cost of living.

365
00:41:54,983 --> 00:42:05,391
[SPEAKER_06]: We all deserve a more affordable Medford where elders can age in place and where new and longtime residents alike can put down roots without fear of displacement due to rising rents and home prices.

366
00:42:06,832 --> 00:42:11,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford students and families deserve thriving public schools and expanded after school and pre-K.

367
00:42:12,337 --> 00:42:14,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Our school staff deserves competitive pay.

368
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:18,542
[SPEAKER_06]: I will fight for a budget that allows us to meet these goals every single year.

369
00:42:19,342 --> 00:42:22,525
[SPEAKER_06]: In addition I proudly support building a new flagship Medford High School.

370
00:42:24,632 --> 00:42:35,419
[SPEAKER_06]: We deserve a Medford that invests in keeping all of our neighbors safe through an unarmed mental health crisis response team, continued non-compliance with ICE, and better social services for our neighbors in need.

371
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,781
[SPEAKER_06]: Safety also means our roads and sidewalks.

372
00:42:39,181 --> 00:42:42,023
[SPEAKER_06]: And as a transportation planner, road safety is my bread and butter.

373
00:42:42,624 --> 00:42:48,928
[SPEAKER_06]: In the last five years, Medford has seen at least 84 crashes which resulted in serious injuries or fatalities.

374
00:42:49,448 --> 00:42:52,150
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to treat traffic violence like the emergency it is.

375
00:42:53,397 --> 00:42:58,342
[SPEAKER_06]: At MassDOT, I work with municipalities to help them utilize transportation funding to its full potential.

376
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:04,970
[SPEAKER_06]: I work closely on funding for large capital projects and I help manage essential programs such as the Safe Routes to School Program.

377
00:43:05,851 --> 00:43:11,036
[SPEAKER_06]: This has given me a bird's eye view of the regional problems that affect us here in Medford and where the solutions lie.

378
00:43:11,905 --> 00:43:18,050
[SPEAKER_06]: As your city council counselor, I will make sure we strategically leverage our transportation funding to make our streets safer.

379
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:26,516
[SPEAKER_06]: I will also make sure the city completes an ADA transition plan so that everyone can participate in civic life and enjoy all that Medford has to offer.

380
00:43:27,717 --> 00:43:30,880
[SPEAKER_06]: But before my time at MassDOT, I worked right here for Medford City Hall.

381
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:41,688
[SPEAKER_06]: I spearheaded Medford's COVID-19 Business Relief Grant Program, which provided crucial funding to Medford's restaurants, corner stores, salons, and spas to help them survive during an unpredictable time.

382
00:43:42,429 --> 00:43:47,935
[SPEAKER_06]: I developed the city's first outdoor dining program, and I helped the city improve its bus stop and blues bikes infrastructure.

383
00:43:49,396 --> 00:43:54,661
[SPEAKER_06]: As a MassDOT employee, I'm heavily involved in my union, and I currently serve on its board of directors.

384
00:43:56,003 --> 00:44:02,670
[SPEAKER_06]: Medford runs on union power, and I'm proud to be endorsed by SEIU Local 509 and UAW Region 9A.

385
00:44:04,117 --> 00:44:07,641
[SPEAKER_06]: I love being a part of our diverse, multi-generational, vibrant community.

386
00:44:08,362 --> 00:44:13,147
[SPEAKER_06]: My neighbors have always been there for me, and now I'm running for city council to make sure the city is there for you.

387
00:44:13,928 --> 00:44:17,291
[SPEAKER_06]: I look forward to meeting you and talking with you, and I hope to earn your vote this fall.

388
00:44:17,552 --> 00:44:17,752
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

389
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:29,501
[SPEAKER_14]: My name is Paige Valdini.

390
00:44:29,881 --> 00:44:35,866
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm the owner of Paige Aesthetic Skincare in the Hillside, a Medford Public School parent, and I serve on the board of the Medford Chamber of Commerce.

391
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:37,648
[SPEAKER_14]: My husband, Jeff, grew up here.

392
00:44:37,908 --> 00:44:42,972
[SPEAKER_14]: Our daughter, Kate, is a second grader at Missittuck, growing up in the same schools and community her dad once did.

393
00:44:43,833 --> 00:44:50,158
[SPEAKER_14]: Nearly seven years ago, I started my business as a new mom and kept it open through the pandemic, when many in my industry closed.

394
00:44:50,638 --> 00:44:53,340
[SPEAKER_14]: I had to adapt, problem solve, and keep revenue coming in.

395
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:56,143
[SPEAKER_14]: That's not easy as a solo business owner, but I did it.

396
00:44:57,183 --> 00:45:01,727
[SPEAKER_14]: I also helped others in the skincare industry push through because I believe in lifting people up.

397
00:45:02,008 --> 00:45:02,708
[SPEAKER_14]: That's who I am.

398
00:45:02,728 --> 00:45:03,669
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't quit.

399
00:45:03,969 --> 00:45:04,490
[SPEAKER_14]: I adapt.

400
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:05,871
[SPEAKER_14]: I listen and I follow through.

401
00:45:06,291 --> 00:45:07,532
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's what I'll bring to City Hall.

402
00:45:08,508 --> 00:45:19,356
[SPEAKER_14]: Those lessons also reflect the spirit of Medford, a city with deep roots and tradition, a city that's growing and changing, and above all, a city whose strength is in its people, our schools, our small businesses, and the city services that keep us running.

403
00:45:20,256 --> 00:45:22,998
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen what happens when we bring those pieces together.

404
00:45:23,538 --> 00:45:26,480
[SPEAKER_14]: As a chamber board member, I work to support small businesses.

405
00:45:26,701 --> 00:45:31,044
[SPEAKER_14]: I've coached and sponsored local youth sports, and I know the value of showing up for kids and families.

406
00:45:31,704 --> 00:45:36,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Partnering with the PTOs and schools, I've helped expand resources for students, families, and educators.

407
00:45:37,251 --> 00:45:51,147
[SPEAKER_14]: And by connecting groups like The Chamber, run Medford and Tufts University, I've helped raise funds to bring Tufts student athletes in as volunteers for school and community events, proof of what's possible, and a reminder that Tufts can be a stronger financial partner and better neighbor.

408
00:45:52,535 --> 00:45:55,836
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why I believe leadership has to rise above groups or sides.

409
00:45:56,397 --> 00:45:58,177
[SPEAKER_14]: I chose to run unaffiliated.

410
00:45:58,617 --> 00:46:02,459
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be easier to do this with a group or a slate, but that's not why I'm here.

411
00:46:03,299 --> 00:46:09,662
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm willing to take the harder path to represent everyone, to bridge divides, and to make decisions rooted in what's best for Medford.

412
00:46:10,362 --> 00:46:11,383
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a critical moment.

413
00:46:11,743 --> 00:46:14,886
[SPEAKER_14]: Decisions on zoning and growth will shape our future for decades.

414
00:46:15,366 --> 00:46:20,110
[SPEAKER_14]: When zoning reform came forward, I asked to slow it down, not to stop it, so we could get it right.

415
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:28,776
[SPEAKER_14]: I championed separating business districts with mixed use from residential, and I used that time to ask questions and push for input from fire, police, and educators.

416
00:46:29,297 --> 00:46:31,098
[SPEAKER_14]: That's how I will approach every issue.

417
00:46:31,518 --> 00:46:35,461
[SPEAKER_14]: Do the work, listen first, and make decisions with real-life data and community voices.

418
00:46:36,302 --> 00:46:39,325
[SPEAKER_14]: That same approach must guide our budget and growth.

419
00:46:39,625 --> 00:46:42,087
[SPEAKER_14]: We need to generate more revenue to make Medford stronger.

420
00:46:42,507 --> 00:46:47,311
[SPEAKER_14]: That means creating a developer program with clear expectations that ensures developers support our infrastructure.

421
00:46:47,832 --> 00:46:55,538
[SPEAKER_14]: It means attracting the right businesses shaped by community feedback to fill vacant storefronts and bring in revenue that Medford needs to invest in our future.

422
00:46:56,079 --> 00:46:57,980
[SPEAKER_14]: What sets me apart is I've lived this.

423
00:46:58,601 --> 00:46:59,762
[SPEAKER_14]: I've run a business here.

424
00:46:59,862 --> 00:47:03,045
[SPEAKER_14]: I've navigated challenges and I stayed the course when it would have been easier to quit.

425
00:47:03,585 --> 00:47:07,788
[SPEAKER_14]: That experience makes me the candidate best prepared to strengthen Medford's future.

426
00:47:08,428 --> 00:47:10,129
[SPEAKER_14]: At the end of the day, what I bring is different.

427
00:47:10,329 --> 00:47:18,054
[SPEAKER_14]: I've proven I can get through hard challenges, I'm connected across Medford, I adapt, I listen, and I solve problems, and I'm not afraid to show up for the work.

428
00:47:19,095 --> 00:47:25,018
[SPEAKER_14]: After more than 15 years of living here, I believe Medford's best days are ahead and I will keep showing up, asking questions, and moving forward together.

429
00:47:25,499 --> 00:47:29,821
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you to the Medford Democratic Committee, to my fellow candidates, and to everyone here showing up for our city.

430
00:47:29,841 --> 00:47:30,602
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.

431
00:47:42,726 --> 00:47:43,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

432
00:47:44,067 --> 00:47:49,110
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, I would like to thank the Democratic City Committee for allowing me to speak here for you.

433
00:47:49,711 --> 00:47:50,791
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Rick Caraviello.

434
00:47:50,952 --> 00:47:56,455
[SPEAKER_00]: I have served for 12 years as city councilor and three terms as council president.

435
00:47:56,756 --> 00:48:01,479
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also proud to be standing in a building that I played a major role in bringing to our city.

436
00:48:02,199 --> 00:48:08,564
[SPEAKER_00]: I am very thankful for the overwhelming support I have received, encouraging me to run again for city council.

437
00:48:08,964 --> 00:48:10,145
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, I stand before you

438
00:48:11,099 --> 00:48:14,980
[SPEAKER_00]: not just as a candidate, but someone who believes deeply in the power of community.

439
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:21,042
[SPEAKER_00]: I have walked these streets, shopped our local businesses, and listened to your concerns at coffee shops and kitchen tables.

440
00:48:21,642 --> 00:48:27,843
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, I am running again because I believe Medford deserves leadership that listens, acts, and delivers.

441
00:48:28,764 --> 00:48:34,765
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a community rich in history, diversity, and untapped potential, but potential alone is not enough.

442
00:48:35,105 --> 00:48:37,506
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a city council that reflects our values,

443
00:48:38,558 --> 00:48:39,938
[SPEAKER_00]: in fights for our future.

444
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,640
[SPEAKER_00]: The most contentious issue facing Medford is the proposed citywide rezoning and development.

445
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:49,161
[SPEAKER_00]: The top priority of the council is to protect our neighborhoods.

446
00:48:49,401 --> 00:48:52,582
[SPEAKER_00]: However, this commitment has been put aside by this council.

447
00:48:52,942 --> 00:48:57,983
[SPEAKER_00]: This council wants to rezone our residential areas to allow two to six units per house lot.

448
00:48:58,543 --> 00:49:01,124
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a direct attack on Medford's character.

449
00:49:01,764 --> 00:49:05,905
[SPEAKER_00]: We should instead be concentrating on our commercial base and its potential.

450
00:49:06,848 --> 00:49:12,611
[SPEAKER_00]: Meffitt has business districts with untapped potential for growth, but smart growth, not overgrowth.

451
00:49:13,272 --> 00:49:16,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us build on that rather than changing its character.

452
00:49:17,154 --> 00:49:23,598
[SPEAKER_00]: I will seek out common sense proposals for our business districts that will increase tax revenue, promote job opportunities.

453
00:49:23,658 --> 00:49:30,522
[SPEAKER_00]: I will also advocate for responsible development that will protect our neighbors and expand affordable housing options.

454
00:49:31,522 --> 00:49:35,545
[SPEAKER_00]: Police, fire, and DPW need to be supported by our public officials.

455
00:49:36,163 --> 00:49:39,087
[SPEAKER_00]: Long overdue contracts need to be settled.

456
00:49:39,628 --> 00:49:44,014
[SPEAKER_00]: Our streets have long been neglected, and it's time to address the matter at hand.

457
00:49:44,955 --> 00:49:47,859
[SPEAKER_00]: Charter change is also on November's ballot.

458
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,783
[SPEAKER_00]: Please make sure that you support this initiative.

459
00:49:51,668 --> 00:49:52,829
[SPEAKER_00]: This campaign is about us.

460
00:49:53,109 --> 00:49:57,213
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about building a Medford where everyone feels heard, respected, and empowered.

461
00:49:57,573 --> 00:50:00,356
[SPEAKER_00]: I will listen to your concerns, ensure your voice is heard.

462
00:50:00,696 --> 00:50:07,282
[SPEAKER_00]: My priority to restore trust in City Hall by making sure that the City Council serves the public, not politicians.

463
00:50:07,622 --> 00:50:09,424
[SPEAKER_00]: So tonight, I ask for your support.

464
00:50:10,145 --> 00:50:14,328
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us make Medford stronger, fairer, and more united than ever before.

465
00:50:14,569 --> 00:50:14,869
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

466
00:50:24,763 --> 00:50:28,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, I'm Paul Donato Jr., and I'm running to be your next city councilor.

467
00:50:29,486 --> 00:50:34,829
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a lifelong resident, born here and married with four children, with two currently in the school system.

468
00:50:36,137 --> 00:50:42,099
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to thank you for giving me three minutes to speak, because if I was in front of the Medford City Council, I would only have two.

469
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:45,180
[SPEAKER_05]: I love Medford.

470
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:51,062
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a city with rich past and great resources, and most importantly, amazing people.

471
00:50:51,742 --> 00:50:55,324
[SPEAKER_05]: Our residents come from all walks of life and all age groups.

472
00:50:56,144 --> 00:51:02,126
[SPEAKER_05]: And whether they've lived here for decades or just moved in, they'll all help make Medford what it is.

473
00:51:03,626 --> 00:51:07,087
[SPEAKER_05]: What we all share is a desire to see Medford grow and thrive.

474
00:51:08,367 --> 00:51:15,450
[SPEAKER_05]: To make that happen, we need strong leadership and a city government that truly works for the people.

475
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:20,791
[SPEAKER_05]: We need leaders with vision who involve the community in shaping the future.

476
00:51:22,932 --> 00:51:25,993
[SPEAKER_05]: One example is the city's recent rezoning efforts.

477
00:51:26,553 --> 00:51:32,895
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem, the community didn't ask for a complete overhaul of every neighborhood.

478
00:51:33,622 --> 00:51:45,430
[SPEAKER_05]: I believe we should take a smarter, more focused approach, starting with key areas like Mystic F. Right now, it's just a busy road, but it could be so much more.

479
00:51:46,231 --> 00:51:55,617
[SPEAKER_05]: With thoughtful planning, we could add housing, support local businesses, bring in new shops, and improve safety and the look of the area.

480
00:51:56,778 --> 00:52:02,482
[SPEAKER_05]: But these changes come from real conversations with the community, not top-down decisions.

481
00:52:03,589 --> 00:52:06,211
[SPEAKER_05]: Another area full of potential is Medford Square.

482
00:52:06,831 --> 00:52:16,297
[SPEAKER_05]: We've had plenty of studies and good ideas like more housing, riverfront walking paths, restaurants, parking, and shops that people want.

483
00:52:17,397 --> 00:52:24,482
[SPEAKER_05]: I've worked with the city council and residents to turn those ideas into actions through workshops and open discussions.

484
00:52:25,614 --> 00:52:34,481
[SPEAKER_05]: As we plan these improvements, we also need to think about our infrastructure, things like roads, buildings, utilities, and city services.

485
00:52:35,782 --> 00:52:44,028
[SPEAKER_05]: We must ask, do we have enough police, firefighters, and DPW workers and staff and equipment to support these changes?

486
00:52:44,808 --> 00:52:50,012
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll make sure infrastructure planning is a required part of the development or rezoning project.

487
00:52:50,828 --> 00:52:57,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Smart rezoning and solid infrastructure planning are two key areas that I'll focus on as your new city councilor.

488
00:52:58,294 --> 00:53:05,359
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'll also work with the new effective council to tackle other challenges and build a bright future Medford.

489
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:11,884
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd be honored to earn your vote and you can contact me at Donato4Medford.com.

490
00:53:12,065 --> 00:53:12,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

491
00:53:23,813 --> 00:53:24,993
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, I'm Melanie Tringali.

492
00:53:25,633 --> 00:53:33,875
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know how I'm gonna top that, Paul, but anyways, first of all, I wanna thank the Medford Democrat City Committee for organizing this event.

493
00:53:35,116 --> 00:53:37,456
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a longtime resident of Medford and a homeowner.

494
00:53:38,016 --> 00:53:41,577
[SPEAKER_07]: My husband, James Murdoch, and I live on Forest Street with our four children.

495
00:53:42,377 --> 00:53:46,238
[SPEAKER_07]: Both my parents were born and raised here and graduated from Medford High.

496
00:53:46,798 --> 00:53:52,900
[SPEAKER_07]: My father, Salvatore J. Tringali, lived in South Medford, and my mother, Lorraine Mifflin, grew up on the hillside.

497
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:58,121
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a graduate of UMass Amherst and have over 20 years of business experience.

498
00:53:58,901 --> 00:54:01,382
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as I have lived here, I have served this community.

499
00:54:02,082 --> 00:54:11,084
[SPEAKER_07]: I served on the Medford Family Network Advisory Board, was co-chair of the PTO for what was then the Columbus School, and served on the Historic District Commission.

500
00:54:11,964 --> 00:54:18,866
[SPEAKER_07]: Today, I'm a board member of the Royaltory Club, an organization that provides services to the city and schools.

501
00:54:20,769 --> 00:54:23,771
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm running because this is my home and a city I deeply love.

502
00:54:24,651 --> 00:54:29,474
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to serve this community, make a positive impact, and ensure Medford is the best it can be.

503
00:54:31,127 --> 00:54:38,049
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe in common sense change, the kind that strengthens neighborhoods, improves city services, and respects the history and character of our community.

504
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:44,831
[SPEAKER_07]: As a councilwoman, there are many things I will work on, but given the time tonight, let me highlight my top four priorities.

505
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:49,333
[SPEAKER_07]: One, I will always protect our neighborhoods and historic squares.

506
00:54:49,993 --> 00:54:53,234
[SPEAKER_07]: Blanket rezoning would forever change our neighborhoods and community.

507
00:54:53,974 --> 00:54:59,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead, we should focus on thoughtful commercial development that grows our tax base and revitalizes our squares.

508
00:55:00,516 --> 00:55:04,177
[SPEAKER_07]: Two, our streets and sidewalks continue to be in disrepair.

509
00:55:04,897 --> 00:55:08,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Recent staffing changes and overrides have not made significant improvements.

510
00:55:09,538 --> 00:55:12,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Potholes remain and sidewalks are unsafe.

511
00:55:13,219 --> 00:55:20,041
[SPEAKER_07]: Safe, walkable sidewalks and well-maintained streets are basic services that meet the needs of every citizen in the city.

512
00:55:21,539 --> 00:55:25,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Our first responders risk their lives every day to keep us safe.

513
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:31,722
[SPEAKER_07]: They deserve to be fully staffed, have safe and clean facilities, and the equipment to do their jobs well.

514
00:55:32,582 --> 00:55:34,883
[SPEAKER_07]: Public safety must come first in our city budget.

515
00:55:35,983 --> 00:55:40,505
[SPEAKER_07]: And fourth, for the fourth year in a row, Medford has had a large amount of free cash.

516
00:55:41,045 --> 00:55:47,567
[SPEAKER_07]: The percentage of that free cash exceeds most cities our size of what is considered to be a normal percent of budget.

517
00:55:48,407 --> 00:55:55,532
[SPEAKER_07]: I will push for line item budget breakdown and responsible planning so taxpayer dollars are spent wisely and timely.

518
00:55:56,533 --> 00:56:06,661
[SPEAKER_07]: In closing, Medford deserves a city council that puts Medford first, protecting our neighborhoods, fixing our streets and sidewalks, supporting our first responders, and spending responsibly.

519
00:56:07,341 --> 00:56:12,683
[SPEAKER_07]: As an independent candidate, I will bring balance, common sense, and accountability to City Hall.

520
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:19,045
[SPEAKER_07]: On Tuesday, September 16th, I respectfully ask for one of your seven votes for Medford City Council.

521
00:56:19,386 --> 00:56:19,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

522
00:56:29,069 --> 00:56:29,910
[SPEAKER_19]: Good evening, everyone.

523
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:32,070
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for spending your Wednesday night with us.

524
00:56:32,631 --> 00:56:35,852
[SPEAKER_19]: My name is Emily Lozaro, and I am running again to be your City Councilor.

525
00:56:36,772 --> 00:56:49,298
[SPEAKER_19]: Before being a politician, I'm a writer, a mom of two kids in our public schools, and a cyclist, and an advocate who ran for office because I was living out the effects of failed policy, and I decided I wanted to be part of the solution.

526
00:56:50,424 --> 00:56:58,670
[SPEAKER_19]: working in pursuit of a community of care, a city that stands beside each other, not against one another, has underscored my personal and professional life.

527
00:56:59,531 --> 00:57:09,538
[SPEAKER_19]: As the former assistant director and the current president of the Malden Warming Center, I can attest that our community members with the greatest challenges are worthy of care and have inherent value and dignity.

528
00:57:09,558 --> 00:57:18,445
[SPEAKER_19]: 40% of Medford households experience hunger and 7,500 Medford residents qualify for affordable housing and we don't have anywhere for them to live.

529
00:57:20,037 --> 00:57:25,339
[SPEAKER_19]: I've done a lot of listening consensus building and learning in my first term and it reminds me of why I ran for office.

530
00:57:25,979 --> 00:57:27,759
[SPEAKER_19]: Government can't be afraid to do what's right.

531
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:30,140
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm ready to continue in that mission together.

532
00:57:31,041 --> 00:57:38,483
[SPEAKER_19]: I've worked diligently on legislation that shores up the rights of our residents like the welcoming city ordinance and the gender affirming care and reproductive health care ordinance.

533
00:57:39,021 --> 00:57:41,062
[SPEAKER_19]: protecting our neighbors from federal overreach.

534
00:57:41,803 --> 00:57:53,070
[SPEAKER_19]: I've worked with state legislators and city public safety officials to make major improvements to rotaries where Dan Dill and Arthur Weber, Medford residents, were killed crossing the street in crosswalks this past winter.

535
00:57:53,811 --> 00:58:01,556
[SPEAKER_19]: I secured $750,000 of funding in the supplemental budget as part of the millionaire's tax to improve the rotaries near Dan Dill's crash.

536
00:58:01,616 --> 00:58:02,937
[SPEAKER_19]: Those improvements are happening right now.

537
00:58:02,977 --> 00:58:03,758
[SPEAKER_19]: You can actually see them.

538
00:58:05,757 --> 00:58:09,958
[SPEAKER_19]: I am fortunate enough, if I am fortunate enough to earn your vote once more, I will keep up this good work.

539
00:58:10,498 --> 00:58:21,820
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm advocating for our fire department by asking our mayor to use free cash, Melanie and I agree on free cash, to fund a full dive team, to keep our residents safe in our beautiful lakes and rivers.

540
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:25,260
[SPEAKER_19]: Our firefighters are ready to protect Medford, let's help them do it.

541
00:58:26,141 --> 00:58:33,942
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm working closely with our business community to ensure that Medford is a beautiful and friendly place to operate with vibrant and bustling squares and business districts.

542
00:58:34,630 --> 00:58:45,578
[SPEAKER_19]: I am working closely with parents and elementary schools across Medford to reimagine the citywide elementary alliance ensuring the money raised is shared equitably based on the diverse needs and populations from Glenwood to Hillside.

543
00:58:46,819 --> 00:58:56,846
[SPEAKER_19]: And as a member of the Medford comprehensive high school building committee I'm working collaboratively to deliver a brand new high school for our students to learn and grow and so that our community can feel a newfound sense of Mustang pride.

544
00:58:57,927 --> 00:59:02,751
[SPEAKER_19]: I talked to residents at the senior center Wegmans the disability fair soccer practice

545
00:59:03,267 --> 00:59:06,048
[SPEAKER_19]: car park, elegant nails, and everywhere in between.

546
00:59:06,068 --> 00:59:10,308
[SPEAKER_19]: I see you, I hear you, and I take action for you, whoever you are.

547
00:59:11,249 --> 00:59:20,110
[SPEAKER_19]: You deserve an elected official who believes wholeheartedly in the inherent worth of every human being and who will stand up boldly for that policy, for the policy that reflects that.

548
00:59:20,771 --> 00:59:23,351
[SPEAKER_19]: And above all else, this campaign is about taking care of each other.

549
00:59:24,431 --> 00:59:28,952
[SPEAKER_19]: Everybody deserves to love where they live and a city council that will work tirelessly for their community.

550
00:59:29,692 --> 00:59:32,253
[SPEAKER_19]: You can count on me to continue to put in that work.

551
00:59:32,553 --> 00:59:32,773
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you.

552
00:59:46,433 --> 00:59:50,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for the committee for hosting this event and my fellow candidates for being here today.

553
00:59:50,576 --> 00:59:51,317
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Zach bears.

554
00:59:52,037 --> 00:59:59,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Six years ago I ran for Medford City Council because I saw what decades of shrinking government and reactive decision making had done to our city.

555
00:59:59,983 --> 01:00:01,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford had become a city of no.

556
01:00:02,365 --> 01:00:05,247
[SPEAKER_01]: No you can't get help at City Hall unless you know the right person.

557
01:00:05,968 --> 01:00:09,971
[SPEAKER_01]: No the city won't address the housing crisis that's made it too hard to build a future here.

558
01:00:10,671 --> 01:00:12,773
[SPEAKER_01]: No the city won't stop the slow bleed.

559
01:00:13,079 --> 01:00:19,103
[SPEAKER_01]: decades of budget cuts that left our streets crumbling and our schools without the resources students and teachers need to thrive.

560
01:00:19,764 --> 01:00:34,554
[SPEAKER_01]: But together we've accomplished so much to do big things make hard decisions and start to become a city of yes a city that says yes to more transparent open government with clear goals processes and principles for how we make decisions together.

561
01:00:35,202 --> 01:00:47,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes to finally creating a comprehensive plan already rezoning Mystic Ave and doing the rezoning project that will encourage real and transformative growth, build more housing and revitalize our business districts.

562
01:00:48,313 --> 01:00:54,118
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes to passing questions seven and eight last year to stop the bleeding and invest in our schools and DPW.

563
01:00:54,718 --> 01:01:00,543
[SPEAKER_01]: And yes to a real plan for growth and new revenue so we don't rely on regular overrides to provide basic services.

564
01:01:01,757 --> 01:01:26,157
[SPEAKER_01]: This has only been possible because of the commitment of so many residents and city leaders to work together for a simple and just cause, to make Medford, an even better place, a city that works for all of us, a city that leads with shared values, clear principles, and delivers real results for our residents, a city government committed to leading with compassion, hard work, and supporting those most in need.

565
01:01:26,772 --> 01:01:35,758
[SPEAKER_01]: to listening to the unheard, not just the loudest voices, to making tough choices and telling people the hard truths, not the easy falsehoods we might want to believe.

566
01:01:36,659 --> 01:01:38,240
[SPEAKER_01]: Voters have a clear choice this November.

567
01:01:38,741 --> 01:01:40,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we vote to keep moving forward?

568
01:01:40,782 --> 01:01:46,066
[SPEAKER_01]: My answer is yes, and I believe the people of the city of Medford will keep saying yes to moving forward too.

569
01:01:47,407 --> 01:01:54,972
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been the honor of my life to serve my hometown, and if I earn your vote for my fourth term, I guarantee that I will keep fighting for a Medford

570
01:01:55,453 --> 01:01:59,499
[SPEAKER_01]: where our city government lifts everyone up and solves big problems together.

571
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:07,531
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want compassionate, principled, and effective leadership to keep Medford moving forward, I ask for your vote on September 16th and November 4th.

572
01:02:07,811 --> 01:02:08,071
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

573
01:02:18,522 --> 01:02:19,002
[SPEAKER_20]: Good evening.

574
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:23,805
[SPEAKER_20]: I am Trish Schiapelle, an independent candidate and homeowner running for the City Council.

575
01:02:24,385 --> 01:02:28,027
[SPEAKER_20]: I moved here to attend Simmons and completed my MBA in 2001.

576
01:02:28,747 --> 01:02:38,512
[SPEAKER_20]: I have 20 years of experience as a commercial lender in the banking industry, working with CEOs and CFOs with companies with revenues of $10 million to $60 million.

577
01:02:39,212 --> 01:02:49,302
[SPEAKER_20]: I became politically active in Medford when I led the battle to stop a methadone dispensary from coming to my Salem Street neighborhood, just 0.23 miles from an elementary school.

578
01:02:50,043 --> 01:02:52,646
[SPEAKER_20]: And then again with the radical rezoning of Salem Street.

579
01:02:53,126 --> 01:02:59,412
[SPEAKER_20]: After many protests from us, the residents, the OCD, delistened and rolled back the zoning to what the neighborhood wanted.

580
01:03:00,053 --> 01:03:10,824
[SPEAKER_20]: Unfortunately, this City Council, under the leadership of Zach Baers and a motion from Matt Lemming, denied the citizens what they wanted and reverted back to the original zoning.

581
01:03:11,465 --> 01:03:15,969
[SPEAKER_20]: We must stop radical rezoning, which is now being proposed across the city.

582
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:21,394
[SPEAKER_20]: Our job on the City Council is to protect our neighborhoods, not exploit them.

583
01:03:22,055 --> 01:03:27,338
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, we must upgrade our squares and business districts, but not to the detriment of our neighborhoods.

584
01:03:27,838 --> 01:03:31,000
[SPEAKER_20]: Our city has been left to deteriorate for far too long.

585
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,442
[SPEAKER_20]: Density is not going to solve that.

586
01:03:33,942 --> 01:03:42,387
[SPEAKER_20]: The recent fire that took place in Somerville and demolished three homes less than a week ago was caused by all of their zoning changes to accommodate density.

587
01:03:42,927 --> 01:03:49,131
[SPEAKER_20]: Be warned, this will happen here if we allow the density City Council wants forced on our neighborhoods.

588
01:03:49,691 --> 01:03:50,992
[SPEAKER_20]: I will fight for our neighborhoods.

589
01:03:51,792 --> 01:03:53,915
[SPEAKER_20]: We must request a forensic audit.

590
01:03:54,376 --> 01:04:05,872
[SPEAKER_20]: We all work hard for our money and it is incumbent for the City to accurately report to the public exactly how, where, why our money is being spent, dollar for dollar.

591
01:04:06,793 --> 01:04:09,855
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, we have an audit annually by state-approved firm.

592
01:04:10,276 --> 01:04:14,198
[SPEAKER_20]: However, we taxpayers deserve better financial reporting.

593
01:04:14,979 --> 01:04:24,066
[SPEAKER_20]: Once our finances are in order, we can then make a sound decision and plan to fix our roads, fix our sidewalks, and get the lead out of our drinking water.

594
01:04:24,446 --> 01:04:25,727
[SPEAKER_20]: Medford deserves better.

595
01:04:26,247 --> 01:04:28,389
[SPEAKER_20]: We need to increase our commercial tax rate.

596
01:04:28,689 --> 01:04:31,791
[SPEAKER_20]: The homeowners can't be the sole source of tax revenue.

597
01:04:32,331 --> 01:04:44,039
[SPEAKER_20]: We just lost $600,000 in tax revenue on the old Budweiser campus because our mayor allowed it to be sold to the MBTA, the same MBTA that she sits on the board of directors.

598
01:04:44,660 --> 01:04:54,547
[SPEAKER_20]: I ask you, Madam Mayor, isn't that a conflict of interest, selling out the taxpayers of this city to do a favor for a state agency of which you are a board member?

599
01:04:55,731 --> 01:04:59,573
[SPEAKER_20]: I most certainly would find that is to be the case in my opinion.

600
01:05:00,033 --> 01:05:02,475
[SPEAKER_20]: And we must support our police and fire departments.

601
01:05:03,095 --> 01:05:04,836
[SPEAKER_20]: They are very important to our city.

602
01:05:05,416 --> 01:05:17,442
[SPEAKER_20]: After meeting with the President of Firefighters Local 1032, I learned that our fire department is understaffed to meet the needs of our current population and will not meet the needs of the proposed expansions.

603
01:05:17,903 --> 01:05:19,824
[SPEAKER_20]: Remember, a vote for me is a vote for you.

604
01:05:20,064 --> 01:05:21,484
[SPEAKER_20]: I respectfully ask for your vote.

605
01:05:21,945 --> 01:05:22,145
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

606
01:05:38,108 --> 01:05:45,196
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you to the Medford Democratic City Committee, the Library, my fellow candidates, and everyone for coming and tuning in.

607
01:05:45,957 --> 01:05:57,169
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Milva McDonald, and the story of why I'm running for City Council starts a long time ago, as a kid growing up with an immigrant working-class mom who came to America from Italy in the 1950s.

608
01:05:58,971 --> 01:06:02,693
[SPEAKER_03]: She was the hardest worker I've ever known, and she passed her work ethic on to me.

609
01:06:03,673 --> 01:06:16,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether working at the Boston Globe while raising my four kids, sitting on the board of nonprofits, or helping launch the Mystic LGBTQ Plus Youth Support Network, I have always put in the hard work required to get things done.

610
01:06:17,319 --> 01:06:21,121
[SPEAKER_03]: A few years ago, I decided charter review needed to get done in Medford.

611
01:06:21,862 --> 01:06:34,809
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2021, I convened a group of residents to pursue options, and in late 2022, at our request, Mayor Brianna Lungo Kern formed the Medford Charter Study Committee and appointed me as chair.

612
01:06:35,709 --> 01:06:41,872
[SPEAKER_03]: For two years, I led our 11-member committee in a comprehensive review of our city's foundational document.

613
01:06:42,592 --> 01:06:50,355
[SPEAKER_03]: As a result, for the first time in 40 years, a new charter is projected to be on your municipal ballot this November.

614
01:06:51,555 --> 01:06:55,217
[SPEAKER_03]: My experience chairing the committee inspired me to run for office.

615
01:06:55,957 --> 01:07:02,480
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to bring the same level of research, outreach, and deep listening to the work of being your city councilor.

616
01:07:04,647 --> 01:07:12,671
[SPEAKER_03]: My priorities include growing the city's tax base through zoning, reviewing fee structures, and fighting for a better pilot agreement with Tufts.

617
01:07:13,431 --> 01:07:16,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Addressing the affordable housing crisis is a necessity.

618
01:07:16,673 --> 01:07:20,475
[SPEAKER_03]: We must support the Affordable Housing Trust and the Community Land Trust.

619
01:07:21,255 --> 01:07:30,318
[SPEAKER_03]: To ease the burden on taxpayers and renters, we should explore a residential exemption for owner-occupied homes and look further at the Good Landlord Tax Credit.

620
01:07:31,378 --> 01:07:41,442
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to ensure that we are meeting the goals in the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan, which continues to safeguard Medford for the future while improving life now.

621
01:07:42,422 --> 01:07:51,711
[SPEAKER_03]: Medford has great cultural organizations, but I believe the arts need an anchor at City Hall, so I support the installation of a City Arts Coordinator.

622
01:07:52,732 --> 01:08:01,381
[SPEAKER_03]: As Councillor, I would also work to create a commission to promote visibility, equality, and empowerment of our LGBTQ plus community.

623
01:08:02,442 --> 01:08:11,305
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's also the job of municipal officials to support our dedicated city staff and those in need, like seniors on fixed incomes and immigrant communities.

624
01:08:12,125 --> 01:08:16,287
[SPEAKER_03]: I love people, hearing their concerns and stories, and doing my best to help.

625
01:08:16,927 --> 01:08:31,572
[SPEAKER_03]: As a second-generation Italian-American with working-class roots, I will always put in the time, effort, and research needed to get the job done, and I will make responsiveness and respect priorities in all my interactions.

626
01:08:32,332 --> 01:08:40,781
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited to get to work to make our beloved city an even better place to live, and I ask for your vote in September and November.

627
01:08:40,921 --> 01:08:41,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

628
01:08:50,131 --> 01:08:51,832
[SPEAKER_09]: I really want to thank the candidates.

629
01:08:51,913 --> 01:08:54,255
[SPEAKER_09]: They did a fabulous job, but I must say, yes.

630
01:09:01,299 --> 01:09:14,183
[SPEAKER_09]: In full disclosure, I put up the yellow card about 15 seconds sooner for one of the candidates, and I was going to add it on to the end, and the person finished.

631
01:09:14,683 --> 01:09:20,125
[SPEAKER_09]: So, Mr. Merritt, I want to know if you have one thing more you want to say, because you'll be able to sing.

632
01:09:22,350 --> 01:09:37,240
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I would have added it on the end, but he finished his speech, and I so apologize, but he didn't want to say, come back, and I didn't want to say to all of you, but full disclosure, it was one timing error that I profusely apologize for.

633
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:38,961
[SPEAKER_09]: I am sorry.

634
01:09:41,557 --> 01:09:42,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, good, thank you.

635
01:09:42,837 --> 01:09:43,817
[SPEAKER_09]: But I did want to say that.

636
01:09:44,158 --> 01:09:46,278
[SPEAKER_09]: So thanks everybody for coming.

637
01:09:46,338 --> 01:09:50,179
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's such a great turnout, and I think we have a wonderful pool of candidates.

638
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:52,959
[SPEAKER_09]: And I say, Bruce, would you like to say anything?

639
01:09:54,059 --> 01:09:54,639
[SPEAKER_09]: We're all set.

640
01:09:54,679 --> 01:09:55,680
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all for coming.

641
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:56,120
[SPEAKER_09]: Mingle.

642
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:57,020
[SPEAKER_09]: Have a great night.

643
01:10:10,002 --> 01:10:20,632
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just in the interest of saving our earth, could I please have these back when we're done?

644
01:10:21,713 --> 01:10:22,154
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

645
01:10:22,434 --> 01:10:23,595
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a minor thing.

646
01:10:23,635 --> 01:10:25,657
[SPEAKER_08]: The name tag's back because we can reuse them.

647
01:10:26,438 --> 01:10:26,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

648
01:10:29,935 --> 01:10:30,536
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good, I'm good.

649
01:10:30,636 --> 01:10:30,816
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

650
01:10:52,890 --> 01:10:53,330
Okay.

651
01:10:53,351 --> 01:10:53,911
Yeah.

652
01:11:13,056 --> 01:11:14,497
[SPEAKER_08]: Leave it on while you mingle.

653
01:11:14,597 --> 01:11:15,958
[SPEAKER_08]: And then give it to Anita.

654
01:11:16,018 --> 01:11:18,839
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Melanie, I am sorry.

655
01:11:19,099 --> 01:11:20,980
[SPEAKER_08]: Why don't you leave your name tag on?

656
01:11:21,060 --> 01:11:21,580
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you sure?

657
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:23,461
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody knows you're right.

658
01:11:23,581 --> 01:11:24,141
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

659
01:11:24,382 --> 01:11:25,022
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

660
01:11:25,962 --> 01:11:31,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Anita.

661
01:11:34,110 --> 01:11:34,730
Yeah, exactly.

662
01:11:34,750 --> 01:11:35,611
What a nice turnout.

663
01:11:35,651 --> 01:11:35,991
I know.

664
01:12:02,242 --> 01:12:02,522
Thank you.

665
01:12:27,790 --> 01:12:28,271
Thank you.

666
01:12:44,761 --> 01:12:44,881
[SPEAKER_05]: next

667
01:13:08,948 --> 01:13:10,069
No, no, but I saw that you were trying to listen to me.

668
01:13:33,383 --> 01:13:35,084
Hey, I wanted to ask, so I'm meeting next to Mystic.

669
01:13:35,104 --> 01:13:35,665
What was the,

670
01:14:01,723 --> 01:14:02,563
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
