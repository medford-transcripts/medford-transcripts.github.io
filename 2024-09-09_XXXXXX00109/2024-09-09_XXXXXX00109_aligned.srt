Thanks so much for being with me here today.

11
00:00:47,405 --> 00:00:50,827
If you don't mind just introducing yourself with your name, pronouns, and a bit about who you are.

12
00:00:51,587 --> 00:00:51,847
Great.

13
00:00:52,468 --> 00:00:53,689
My name is Anna Callahan.

14
00:00:53,749 --> 00:00:55,430
She, her, coming at you from Medford.

15
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,412
I got to say that because I run my own podcast, and so I always say that at the beginning of mine.

16
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:02,854
And I'm a city councilor.

17
00:01:02,894 --> 00:01:05,015
I'm a new city councilor, just got elected in November.

18
00:01:05,295 --> 00:01:05,736
Great.

19
00:01:05,756 --> 00:01:09,618
And we do have a special co-host with us today, my niece, Bailey Jo.

20
00:01:10,098 --> 00:01:12,440
is here so you may hear some baby noises in the background.

21
00:01:13,682 --> 00:01:14,402
The baby podcast.

22
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:16,544
Yeah the new baby podcast rebranding.

23
00:01:16,564 --> 00:01:27,455
Yeah so I think before we get into the to talk about City Council I'm wondering if you could answer our question for everyone which you've answered before but if you you may have some updates.

24
00:01:27,495 --> 00:01:29,998
What is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

25
00:01:30,418 --> 00:01:33,640
Oh yeah, well it still is Oasis.

26
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,342
Oasis is, it's close to us.

27
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:43,047
My son, who's nine, loves to go there because they have a buffet and he can pick anything he wants.

28
00:01:43,107 --> 00:01:48,271
He always picks like bread and watermelon, you know, like unexciting nine-year-old things.

29
00:01:49,011 --> 00:01:50,893
And then I love their fish stew.

30
00:01:50,913 --> 00:01:53,034
It's probably my favorite dish on the menu.

31
00:01:53,054 --> 00:01:56,697
But when I, I love their buffet because I just try like everything.

32
00:01:56,737 --> 00:01:58,078
It's like so amazing.

33
00:01:58,558 --> 00:02:01,419
So I do really love Oasis.

34
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,460
It's probably my go-to.

35
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,061
But there are a lot of wonderful, wonderful places in Medford.

36
00:02:07,121 --> 00:02:08,762
And I go to Tamper a lot.

37
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:09,562
Oh, yes, yes.

38
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:10,142
Yeah.

39
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:13,243
Shelley and I meet up there sometimes, for sure.

40
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,484
Yeah, Oasis.

41
00:02:14,624 --> 00:02:23,327
If I may, Tamper, in the wintertime, I started to go to Tamper every day, even if I wasn't going to work there, because they have their own homemade bone broth.

42
00:02:23,807 --> 00:02:26,407
Oh, I did see that on the menu mug of bone broth.

43
00:02:26,628 --> 00:02:27,208
Oh, man.

44
00:02:27,228 --> 00:02:28,728
I was thrilled.

45
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:29,528
I would get it every day.

46
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:30,128
Nice.

47
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:31,468
That's a good tip.

48
00:02:31,948 --> 00:02:32,329
Thank you.

49
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:38,030
So, yeah, so I think the last time we talked to you, you were campaigning for city council.

50
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,030
And so and I know you you had a lot of important sort of values that you were running on.

51
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,731
And I wonder and I know we also know you from incorruptible master your podcast.

52
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:52,112
So I'm wondering if you could share or reflect on like kind of

53
00:02:52,612 --> 00:02:57,357
How you've held on to those values sort of what you've experienced so far on the city council.

54
00:02:57,598 --> 00:02:57,918
Yeah.

55
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:07,448
So, I have to say, the last like seven eight years of my life, I have been, I used to be a software engineer so I, you know, got.

56
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:24,024
really motivated during the 2016 campaign, and I just decided to devote my life to understanding corruption in politics, which to me is like the number one problem in, you know, America, perhaps the world, right?

57
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,548
And you know, it's a very deep topic.

58
00:03:28,648 --> 00:03:31,491
There are many, many ways that

59
00:03:32,932 --> 00:03:35,959
people get corrupted like the minute they step into office.

60
00:03:37,262 --> 00:03:40,871
But before we go into that, just to answer your question, I ran kind of

61
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:49,353
to be able to implement some of the stuff that I have been talking about for years and years, implement directly.

62
00:03:50,934 --> 00:04:07,603
And it's really interesting to see how the pressure that the city council is under, the really, to me, expected pressure, but which of the different kinds of pressure are very intense at Medford City Council level.

63
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:12,309
and which are really not happening.

64
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:22,444
Today I will be talking about, what I'm mostly going to talk about is the intense pressure that we are under, that I consider one of the classic forms of corruption in government.

65
00:04:23,115 --> 00:04:24,375
Great, yeah, I would love to hear about that.

66
00:04:24,395 --> 00:04:25,276
I think we've been.

67
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:26,976
I think Bailey would really like to hear about it.

68
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,737
Bailey has a lot to say about corruption, I guess.

69
00:04:30,017 --> 00:04:47,361
But yeah, so I think, so this is, we're recording this beginning of August, and we sort of had an interesting budget season, and I think we, like the last city council meeting that I watched was, there's like an introduction of a, I guess a motion about an audit by,

70
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:55,590
Counselor scare Peli but yeah, I guess I'm interested to hear what you know what the pressure has been like how you would talk about that.

71
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,210
How you describe it.

72
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,695
Yeah, well, I'm gonna go ahead and dive in I

73
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:09,007
I've really spent a lot of time looking at why politicians, and I want to define what I mean by corruption.

74
00:05:10,287 --> 00:05:15,451
So almost every single politician, they get elected, and they run on a platform.

75
00:05:15,471 --> 00:05:16,712
They say they're going to do certain things.

76
00:05:17,132 --> 00:05:25,758
And then either quickly or slowly, they move away from the policies they first ran on and toward policies that favor the wealthy.

77
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:31,028
Like that's my, that is the way that I describe it.

78
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:35,150
I think that happens to almost every single person who is elected.

79
00:05:36,591 --> 00:05:42,054
And like I said, a lot of different kinds of pressure, takes a bunch of different forms, but that is the single constant.

80
00:05:42,774 --> 00:05:54,440
There was an amazing report done, and at this point it's pretty old, it's maybe almost 20 years old, but it's called the Princeton Study, and it basically looked at 20 years of bills in Congress.

81
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:06,585
their likelihood of passing, and their popularity among the bottom 90% of wage earners, I think it was wage and not wealth, and the top 10% of wage earners.

82
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:16,369
And their final outcome, what they got out of all the data was that the desires of the bottom 90% of people in America

83
00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:25,827
have a minuscule, near zero, statistically insignificant impact on policy.

84
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:32,231
So minuscule, near zero, I think the important one is statistically insignificant.

85
00:06:32,411 --> 00:06:36,794
You can't tell the difference between zero and the margin of error in the piece.

86
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,002
Basically, the only people who are listened to at the congressional level are the top 10% of wage earners in America.

87
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,283
And that is just a fact.

88
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:50,204
So this happens at every level of government.

89
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:52,885
It's not as extreme as at the congressional level.

90
00:06:54,006 --> 00:06:56,447
But that is what I'm talking about in terms of,

91
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:05,628
the pressures that people are under to essentially move away from policies they ran on and move toward policies that favor people who are wealthier.

92
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:08,830
How does that happen in Medford?

93
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:18,333
This is what's been so interesting is there is a group, I think there are two basic elements happening in Medford.

94
00:07:21,195 --> 00:07:32,801
There's corporate lobbying happening in Medford, and there's also the essential fact that a lot of studies have talked about, about just who reaches out to city council, statistically.

95
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:40,925
Who feels like it's their right and they're entitled to email, call, show up at city council meetings, and all this.

96
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:52,260
And statistically, that is people who are wealthier people more likely to own their homes, people who, you know, have more education.

97
00:07:54,383 --> 00:08:16,595
study after study, that's who reaches out to the city council, which means city councils hear from those people, and they think that their constituents have those views, even though there's this gigantic swath of people who, they're too busy, it's not on their radar, for whatever reason, cultural reason, they just don't reach out, and their opinion's probably pretty different.

98
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:26,682
And so I think one of the bigger, I think one of the reasons I reached out to you originally was the sort of policies around housing and renting and landlords.

99
00:08:27,283 --> 00:08:37,891
And I don't know, when you're talking about like wage earners and wealth, like I do sometimes, like I think about inherited wealth in Medford and especially in that topic about landlords.

100
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:40,033
And so I wonder how that's played into all of this.

101
00:08:40,573 --> 00:08:44,655
Yeah, well, the corporate lobbying group that I'm talking about is the Greater Boston Real Estate Board.

102
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:48,616
And the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, look, they're not from Medford.

103
00:08:49,337 --> 00:08:50,977
They're outside of our city.

104
00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:52,798
They're a corporate lobbying group.

105
00:08:52,818 --> 00:08:55,159
They represent a lot of gigantic corporate developers.

106
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:04,443
They really are very good at making small landlords who maybe only own one or two properties believe that they're on their side.

107
00:09:06,784 --> 00:09:07,845
I really don't think they are.

108
00:09:08,586 --> 00:09:10,247
But they're good at making it seem like that.

109
00:09:10,787 --> 00:09:23,016
And they have spent thousands of dollars sending mailers against things like the real estate transfer fee and the other housing policies that we, six out of the seven of the people on the city council, we ran on.

110
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:25,337
It was on all of our literature.

111
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:26,578
It was on all of our websites.

112
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:28,440
We talked about it at the doors.

113
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,620
This was not hidden.

114
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:31,122
This was something everybody knew about.

115
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:35,765
And this is something that we won the election on, is housing policies like

116
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:37,460
the real estate transfer fee.

117
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:50,570
And you know, there's stuff written up in the Boston Globe about how the Greater Boston Real Estate Board is spending thousands and thousands, I don't know how much, of dollars across the state to tank that piece of legislation.

118
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,193
Because it is a state, it's like proposed to be a statewide policy as well, right?

119
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:54,333
Yeah.

120
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,015
There's state enabling legislation, right?

121
00:09:57,035 --> 00:10:05,242
So there's, you can pass a home rule petition at the city council level, but there's no guarantee that you can unless the state enabling legislation passes.

122
00:10:05,682 --> 00:10:13,027
If the state-enabling legislation passes, because there's also that at the state level, then we would be able to pass it without a home loan petition.

123
00:10:13,107 --> 00:10:13,568
Right, right, right.

124
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:19,812
Yeah, and so you said that this lobbying group is good at making it seem like they're on the side of landlords.

125
00:10:20,713 --> 00:10:21,413
What does that mean?

126
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:26,557
What do you think is the understanding of these landlords in terms of their motivation?

127
00:10:27,298 --> 00:10:29,699
Yeah, so for example, with the real estate transfer fee,

128
00:10:33,157 --> 00:10:45,482
It's couched in this like, oh, they're going to make it apply to every home and it's going to be, you know, they couch it so that no matter what we say.

129
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:57,230
The Greater Boston Real Estate Board has put forward what they think we're going to do and they're accusing us that we are going to do things that we aren't going to do and we've said publicly we're not going to do.

130
00:10:58,831 --> 00:11:04,558
So, you know, and I'll just give the example of like the state enabling legislation was

131
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:12,988
only going to apply to houses that sell for over a million dollars and only apply to the amount over a million dollars.

132
00:11:13,308 --> 00:11:20,798
So like if you sell your house for a million dollars and one dollar, you would pay like 1% or 2% of one dollar.

133
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:25,622
Similar to the fair share amendment?

134
00:11:27,143 --> 00:11:27,803
I think so.

135
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:32,085
In terms of like taxes over or like fees over a million dollars.

136
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:33,186
Exactly, exactly.

137
00:11:33,566 --> 00:11:43,111
So, but you know, people would come and we would say, hey, like, you know, we are inclined to have a limit, like a minimum.

138
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:46,713
And they were like, we don't believe you.

139
00:11:47,372 --> 00:12:04,999
okay well we're like public officials saying public statements and having public things on our public websites and you know I mean they can not believe us all day long but they're not believing us because the real estate you know the greater Boston is out of town corporate lobbying group is sending all this

140
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:09,240
you know, is paying a bunch of money to influence voters.

141
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,420
I mean, that's.

142
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,821
Yeah, it is a real thing.

143
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:18,722
And they they can do it just like any corporate lobbying group, because they have the money to pay people to do this all day long.

144
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:19,102
Yeah.

145
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:31,365
It seems like it mirrors like other processes like federally and then also maybe on the city council where there is like this insistence on misinformation or like that, like and maybe there's an element of like, who do we trust?

146
00:12:31,465 --> 00:12:35,406
But yeah, I guess I wonder how you notice that or like what you think that's about.

147
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:48,834
Oh, I mean, the trust thing is very interesting because, I mean, the second part that I alluded to is who tends to reach out to city council.

148
00:12:49,074 --> 00:12:58,480
And I will say it seems like there is a group of, I don't know how many people, you know, but from among that group,

149
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:04,138
They bring between 25 and 50 people to almost every city council meeting.

150
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:28,501
Because they are the ones that are coming up and speaking at the podium, and there are fewer people from the other side of the policy debate that are coming up and speaking at the podium, they have really accused us of not listening to the community.

151
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:31,223
And I want to get into this, because this is really very, I get it that they,

152
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:45,016
that they may genuinely somehow believe that they are the majority opinion.

153
00:13:45,276 --> 00:13:47,919
I think some of them genuinely, and I have empathy, I do.

154
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,141
I don't think these are bad people.

155
00:13:51,322 --> 00:13:55,046
And I think that their viewpoint on policy is totally valid.

156
00:13:55,506 --> 00:13:57,848
It's not mine, and it's not what I got elected to do.

157
00:13:59,189 --> 00:13:59,929
It's not what I ran on.

158
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,310
And I'm going to do the things that I ran on because that's why I got elected.

159
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,891
I got elected on a policy.

160
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,792
I ran as a policy person.

161
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:09,873
I don't like to talk about my background or who I am that much.

162
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,153
I want to run on policy.

163
00:14:12,493 --> 00:14:15,674
So I'm going to do the things I got elected to do because that's why people elected me.

164
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:26,398
But it is, to me, not helpful when people come

165
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,945
And what they say is, you're not listening to the community.

166
00:14:32,486 --> 00:14:36,150
Because 25 people have gotten up and spoken in one direction.

167
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,754
And when I say people don't come on the other side, that's not really true.

168
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:43,318
They're often 10, 15, 20 people speaking in the other direction.

169
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,142
But the loudest voices,

170
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:50,390
are the ones from this particular group.

171
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,331
And I'm, you know, if any of those people are listening to this podcast, which, you know, very likely they are not.

172
00:14:55,911 --> 00:15:02,493
It's not really geared toward that particular, you know, policy group of people.

173
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:08,815
But I want to lay out, I want to at least explain

174
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:16,950
why we are continuing to vote for the policies that we ran on in a way that hopefully people can understand.

175
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:23,455
I want you to imagine that you

176
00:15:25,013 --> 00:15:28,897
voted for certain people to get elected to your city council.

177
00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:35,623
And hypothetically, yes, hypothetically, you voted to elect certain people to your city council.

178
00:15:36,104 --> 00:15:41,809
And this was an election in which it wasn't, this was really a policy election.

179
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,492
There is no question, it wasn't just a policy election.

180
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:46,914
It wasn't just that everybody had clear policies on there.

181
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:54,965
Like websites on their literature it was also that this was kind of a binary election because.

182
00:15:54,985 --> 00:15:58,211
The 6 of us who got elected.

183
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:05,557
We had literature that put all of our policies on one side and all of our names and pictures on the other side.

184
00:16:06,158 --> 00:16:16,005
So this wasn't like 12 people all running on different independent platforms, and then it just so happens that five or six of them tend to vote together.

185
00:16:16,246 --> 00:16:20,249
This was literally, you're voting for a set of policies.

186
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:22,510
You're voting for those policies.

187
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,811
That's the way that it was.

188
00:16:24,832 --> 00:16:27,694
And we didn't win three seats out of seven.

189
00:16:27,974 --> 00:16:29,515
We didn't win four seats out of seven.

190
00:16:29,895 --> 00:16:31,716
We didn't win five seats out of seven.

191
00:16:32,276 --> 00:16:33,897
We won six seats out of seven.

192
00:16:33,997 --> 00:16:34,558
And guess what?

193
00:16:34,838 --> 00:16:37,980
The runner-up was also on our policy platform.

194
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:44,183
I mean, there is no greater political mandate than that.

195
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,405
That is a mandate.

196
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:53,789
And the reason that the people who support what we're doing aren't showing up to the city council is because why on earth should they show up?

197
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,990
They gave us a freaking mandate.

198
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:02,553
They worked hard to make sure we were elected to do the things we said we would do.

199
00:17:02,973 --> 00:17:15,098
And I want people on the other side to imagine, if you voted somebody into office on a policy platform, and then suddenly they weren't voting that way, you would be pissed.

200
00:17:15,899 --> 00:17:17,159
You would be pissed.

201
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:18,620
You would be like, corruption.

202
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,141
And you would be right.

203
00:17:20,761 --> 00:17:21,421
You would be right.

204
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:31,903
This is one classic and very normal and natural human nature form of corruption.

205
00:17:32,783 --> 00:17:39,164
When a bunch of people show up and they're angry and they're accusing you, you don't want to stand up to them.

206
00:17:39,344 --> 00:17:40,044
It's hard.

207
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:42,645
You got to be kind of brave.

208
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,506
It's deeply unpleasant, deeply unpleasant.

209
00:17:47,809 --> 00:18:01,856
Yeah, one of the statements I was struck by in that meeting about the proposal for the audit was Kit Collins talking about division, right?

210
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:07,839
And when someone's trying to convince you that you're being divided, that's sort of the most divisive tactic.

211
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,821
That was very spot on.

212
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:15,564
Yeah, and I can't imagine it's comfortable to be in those meetings.

213
00:18:16,664 --> 00:18:22,051
And yeah, I don't know what my question is, but I feel like that's got to be hard.

214
00:18:22,071 --> 00:18:28,039
I am so glad that you mentioned this, actually, because I do want to talk a little bit about culture.

215
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:31,364
I think there's a cultural change happening on the State Council.

216
00:18:32,764 --> 00:18:35,386
And I, for one, think it's an incredibly healthy change.

217
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:39,910
So I was not following the Medford City Council eight or 10 years ago.

218
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:47,196
But what I've heard from people is that it was very common for city councilors to get up and just angry rant.

219
00:18:48,277 --> 00:18:54,862
Angry rant at the mayor, angry rant at something that happened, angry rant about a business that is or is not doing whatever.

220
00:18:56,523 --> 00:19:02,028
And that people felt like their city councilor was doing their job if they were standing up and angry ranting.

221
00:19:02,568 --> 00:19:07,273
You know, and look, it's not my style.

222
00:19:07,353 --> 00:19:07,913
I mean, I don't know.

223
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:11,677
It's a little more of my style, I guess, than like some of the other people on the city council.

224
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:14,120
You know, I will say Kit, bless her heart.

225
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,122
She is the most calm.

226
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,604
She's so level-headed.

227
00:19:18,664 --> 00:19:19,225
It's amazing.

228
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:21,547
I can get a little fiery sometimes.

229
00:19:21,587 --> 00:19:22,228
How you wouldn't.

230
00:19:23,469 --> 00:19:25,671
But anyway.

231
00:19:28,264 --> 00:19:36,842
I do want to talk a little bit about the way that angry ranting affects

232
00:19:38,948 --> 00:19:44,870
a body, you know, I've been involved in so many groups, right?

233
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:55,953
It doesn't matter whether it's like an activist group doing like issue politics or electoral politics, or if it's, you know, I've lived in a ton of like intentional communities where like you meet every month just to figure out like who's doing their chores, you know?

234
00:19:56,013 --> 00:20:06,877
Whatever, like, and every group that I have been involved in has explicitly had some kind of basic guideline that says,

235
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:11,788
assume good intent and don't use accusational language.

236
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:12,429
Right?

237
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:14,331
That's basic.

238
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:17,833
That is basic to having a healthy group.

239
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:25,820
As soon as you start lashing out with wild accusations that other people are liars and they're, you know, whatever, whatever.

240
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,624
It is really, really unhealthy.

241
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:31,705
And, you know,

242
00:20:34,503 --> 00:20:48,028
I have to, I can't help but comment that it is not uncommon for people who use intimidation, fear-mongering, accusation, and these other kinds of tactics to project.

243
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:52,469
To accuse other people of doing what they themselves are doing.

244
00:20:53,650 --> 00:21:03,053
And I gotta say, I think that the division in our community is being created by fear-mongering,

245
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,183
misinformation.

246
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:13,930
angry ranting, accusational language, assuming worst intent, you know, these are not healthy.

247
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,311
They are not healthy for any group.

248
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:18,151
It doesn't matter if it's like inside of your family.

249
00:21:18,171 --> 00:21:26,733
I mean, imagine, you're in your family, you know, and you're, you know, one of your parents is accusing the other parent of like being a liar and a, you know, horrible person or whatever.

250
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:30,074
I mean, that is not, everybody knows that is not healthy.

251
00:21:30,094 --> 00:21:34,375
And it's not any healthier in a city council or in an organizing group

252
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:36,456
or really in any group.

253
00:21:36,676 --> 00:21:39,158
It is not healthy behavior.

254
00:21:39,658 --> 00:21:44,020
So I hope, I hope, and I'm happy to disagree with people.

255
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,221
Like I said, I have empathy.

256
00:21:46,702 --> 00:21:55,426
I have a lot of empathy for people who, you know, their policies were the policies done in Medford.

257
00:21:55,446 --> 00:21:59,749
And I think that was because in the past, it was the majority opinion.

258
00:22:00,756 --> 00:22:02,637
And that's great, that's how it should be.

259
00:22:03,077 --> 00:22:09,280
But you know, the city councils tend to lag behind the residents in the policy making, right?

260
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,922
And so I think that actually the majority opinion changed a long time ago.

261
00:22:13,882 --> 00:22:24,687
And it's only now that the city council has caught up to the majority opinion in Medford about policy, about housing policy, about environmental policy, about inclusion policy, about like just about, you name it.

262
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:26,328
Like these things,

263
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:39,805
We, I mean like the six of us who ran, you know, on similar policy platforms, our policy platforms are unquestionably the majority opinion in that.

264
00:22:40,606 --> 00:22:42,146
We know that because of the election, right?

265
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:45,147
I mean, you know, there's no like wondering, right?

266
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:56,714
And I want to say, I have empathy for the people who used to have, who probably genuinely think that they're in the majority.

267
00:22:56,754 --> 00:22:58,275
They genuinely just can't believe.

268
00:22:58,296 --> 00:22:59,637
It's hard for them to believe.

269
00:22:59,737 --> 00:23:00,317
I get that.

270
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:07,364
And I'm not, you know, I don't have any disrespect for them having different policy opinions from me.

271
00:23:08,505 --> 00:23:13,049
And I don't even have disrespect for them in their feelings of loss and anger.

272
00:23:16,358 --> 00:23:21,142
It ain't healthy to lash out and wildly accuse people in the middle of public.

273
00:23:21,202 --> 00:23:23,224
It is not healthy.

274
00:23:23,464 --> 00:23:23,964
It's not good.

275
00:23:23,984 --> 00:23:25,686
Yeah, it's not a good look.

276
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:25,786
Yeah.

277
00:23:26,426 --> 00:23:33,172
And I think what you're speaking to is that perhaps some people have a sense of losing something.

278
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:38,576
Something's being taken away from them, given to other people, which maybe doesn't reflect the reality.

279
00:23:38,636 --> 00:23:42,700
Maybe there is more of a push towards maybe more people getting what they need.

280
00:23:45,097 --> 00:23:57,848
But yeah, I think, and I think that behavior when it's on such a sort of, well, mostly public like display is not a great look like for those people, but also I think the model behavior of the rest of the city council, right?

281
00:23:57,868 --> 00:24:03,753
Like I think even the last group of city councilors, there were some that would shout back at people that were speaking, right?

282
00:24:03,773 --> 00:24:09,659
And like, and sometimes there wasn't like a shutting down of folks who were speaking disrespectfully to city councilors.

283
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,881
So yeah, I think it is like,

284
00:24:12,975 --> 00:24:21,962
It's a little bit calmer in some ways, but I think you're hitting a good point there about just sort of the decorum in those meetings sometimes.

285
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,263
Yeah.

286
00:24:23,823 --> 00:24:24,103
Yeah.

287
00:24:24,324 --> 00:24:27,366
I do want to encourage folks listening.

288
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:37,514
And unfortunately, it has also become really uncomfortable for people who agree with our policy platform to show up because

289
00:24:38,174 --> 00:24:46,898
you know, people will interrupt, people will accuse, people will, you know, like, you're literally going to get attacked if you come and speak.

290
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:49,999
And that is very unfortunate.

291
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:51,780
That is very unhealthy for the community, I think.

292
00:24:52,120 --> 00:25:04,106
But if there are some brave souls out there listening to this, I really want to encourage people to come and say, just say the sort of essential basic reality, which is I'm

293
00:25:08,905 --> 00:25:13,951
I hope you guys can understand that you're not the majority opinion in Medford anymore.

294
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:16,234
The election proved that.

295
00:25:17,836 --> 00:25:22,823
I'm happy to disagree with you on policy, but you've got to accept.

296
00:25:22,843 --> 00:25:25,125
You have to accept you're not the majority anymore.

297
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:26,647
We're the majority.

298
00:25:28,305 --> 00:25:39,312
Yeah, and I think, too, particularly in the housing conversation, I could call to mind several people that I know have lived in Medford for generations whose housing is at risk, like my own neighbors.

299
00:25:39,532 --> 00:25:47,377
So when older family members pass away and there's not a plan for how to keep your home, they will directly benefit from some of these policies.

300
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:51,900
And so I think there's an open-mindedness that's maybe missing.

301
00:25:53,441 --> 00:26:03,604
But yeah also I would totally I have a podcast about this and I think it's scary to go to I've never been to I don't think an in person city council meeting I participated over zoom but even that is scary.

302
00:26:04,165 --> 00:26:11,727
And you're right like I think it is especially for the you know when we started this conversation those folks that may be more marginalized or more like.

303
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:17,429
vulnerable, the thought of speaking to an angry mob, that's not easy.

304
00:26:18,069 --> 00:26:21,431
I do find emailing you all to be helpful as well.

305
00:26:21,451 --> 00:26:22,571
I'm glad you mentioned that.

306
00:26:22,591 --> 00:26:30,154
That's why it was going to be my tip, which is you can email and have your comments read at the meeting.

307
00:26:30,414 --> 00:26:31,355
You don't have to be there.

308
00:26:31,595 --> 00:26:32,235
You don't have to show up on

309
00:26:32,335 --> 00:26:33,416
You can also show up on Zoom.

310
00:26:33,577 --> 00:26:34,618
Zoom is a little easier.

311
00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:39,725
And then you'll be able to speak and you're comfortably sitting in your room.

312
00:26:40,405 --> 00:26:45,672
Although, wow, I'll tell you, these people are like, you should prioritize us and not those people on Zoom.

313
00:26:46,393 --> 00:26:48,896
They are like, you know.

314
00:26:49,757 --> 00:27:02,430
They're like, okay, yeah, you know take out the time to yeah, you know, they took the time to show up at the ballot box and It's not like there weren't other people running.

315
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:02,970
Mm-hmm.

316
00:27:03,451 --> 00:27:05,533
There were other people right exactly, right?

317
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:07,074
Yeah, and also I mean

318
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:10,657
taking the time to show up at a meeting isn't just about the time, right?

319
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:14,259
People have like kids, they have like, you know, they can't always leave the house.

320
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:21,364
So I do think the Zoom option does make it way more accessible and, you know, still a little scary, but yeah.

321
00:27:21,504 --> 00:27:25,266
Yeah, send them in over email and, you know, have them read by somebody who's already there.

322
00:27:25,487 --> 00:27:27,268
You know, that's a great way.

323
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:29,309
You know, you could do that every week.

324
00:27:30,109 --> 00:27:31,050
Send something in.

325
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:31,410
Yeah.

326
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:35,233
You know, pick anything on the agenda and then throw in the comment about like,

327
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:40,191
please city councilors do what you ran on.

328
00:27:40,691 --> 00:27:41,672
Do your policy platform.

329
00:27:42,072 --> 00:27:46,355
Please do pro-housing, pro-environment, because you have a mandate.

330
00:27:47,075 --> 00:27:53,440
The more people who comment on anything and at the bottom say, city councilors, I expect you to do what we voted you in to do.

331
00:27:54,797 --> 00:28:00,359
Well, and I think we have focused a lot on the loud, the self-perceived majority.

332
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:09,842
But there are some coalitions and community groups in Medford that are maybe more aligned with the work you're doing, like Safe Medford, like Housing Medford.

333
00:28:10,383 --> 00:28:19,846
So yeah, I wonder, are there groups that folks could connect with in order to feel a little bit more able to participate or support your work?

334
00:28:20,206 --> 00:28:24,089
It is always great to join these volunteer organizations.

335
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:29,132
The stronger they are, the more the city is able to do.

336
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,615
Trees Medford, I'm such a big trees person.

337
00:28:33,635 --> 00:28:35,236
So Trees Medford is a wonderful group.

338
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:36,257
They're all fantastic.

339
00:28:36,337 --> 00:28:42,501
Safe Medford, those folks, man, when there's certain issues come up, they are there.

340
00:28:42,581 --> 00:28:43,461
They know everything.

341
00:28:43,481 --> 00:28:44,902
They're so informed.

342
00:28:45,022 --> 00:28:46,543
They have the whole history of everything.

343
00:28:46,563 --> 00:28:47,484
They're fantastic.

344
00:28:49,105 --> 00:28:53,227
Housing Medford is a wonderful fantastic group doing a lot of like research all these groups.

345
00:28:53,247 --> 00:28:55,889
They do a ton of research I mean, they're really amazing.

346
00:28:55,989 --> 00:29:10,397
So I absolutely encourage people to get involved in the volunteer groups because they you know, they are They're doing a lot of the work that enables for policies to change and for and for reality to change, right?

347
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:11,418
I mean not everything

348
00:29:11,978 --> 00:29:13,579
that needs to change is a policy.

349
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:21,006
There's some things that just, you know, we got to change things in our city and some volunteering will make it happen.

350
00:29:21,606 --> 00:29:26,210
Yeah, I'm on the Charter Review Committee, Charter Study Commission.

351
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:31,515
We're almost wrapping up our work, but I feel like that would not have happened without the work of volunteers trying to get that done for so long.

352
00:29:31,555 --> 00:29:34,297
So yeah, and I do think, I always think about like,

353
00:29:35,603 --> 00:29:38,185
Medford has a lot of really invested people, right?

354
00:29:38,205 --> 00:29:45,890
They're not always saying the things that you want to hear, but there's a lot of energy towards making our city a place that people like and enjoy.

355
00:29:46,711 --> 00:29:47,091
Yeah.

356
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:47,591
Great.

357
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,653
Well, anything else for today?

358
00:29:49,693 --> 00:29:51,154
Anything else you want to wrap up with?

359
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:55,277
You know, I think that's it for me.

360
00:29:55,597 --> 00:29:57,678
I could have come here and talked about a policy.

361
00:29:57,778 --> 00:29:58,599
I could have come here, whatever.

362
00:29:58,639 --> 00:30:04,583
But the reality is that the pressure at the city council is so

363
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:35,500
ugly it is so difficult and it makes it very difficult for us to do our jobs because like often this group of people will come and they will each speak for five minutes three times I think we've cut it down to three now but you know we would be up past one in the morning like yeah many many many meetings yeah up past one in the morning and you know it's just really hard for us to do our jobs and I will I will comment like we have a really great

364
00:30:37,606 --> 00:30:43,689
We have really great rules around people speaking at the public comment period during city council.

365
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:52,753
It is unfortunate that it is almost exclusively being used by this one group of people and not by the rest of the community.

366
00:30:52,773 --> 00:31:03,018
Because in surrounding cities, I tell you, and in other cities, like I've worked with cities across city councils and city councilors and mayors across the country, it is very normal for there to be one public comment period.

367
00:31:03,459 --> 00:31:04,319
It happens at the beginning.

368
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:05,620
You get two minutes.

369
00:31:07,742 --> 00:31:11,527
When you're done, you go home because there's no more public comment for the rest of the meeting.

370
00:31:12,107 --> 00:31:18,776
We allow people to speak on every agenda item for three minutes each, sometimes multiple times.

371
00:31:18,816 --> 00:31:23,663
We have an unbelievably robust ability for people to come out.

372
00:31:24,443 --> 00:31:26,544
speak their minds on issues.

373
00:31:27,505 --> 00:31:29,446
And I think that's a good thing, right?

374
00:31:30,066 --> 00:31:36,910
I just, I hope that it becomes less, the more accusational it is, the more likely it's going to be ratcheted down.

375
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:43,994
And I hope that it becomes something that people want to use and want to come and

376
00:31:45,393 --> 00:31:47,255
you know, let us know their opinions about things.

377
00:31:47,275 --> 00:31:48,776
So I encourage people to come.

378
00:31:50,097 --> 00:31:53,900
You know, come and speak on things that are maybe less controversial.

379
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,303
You can say your piece, you can talk about really anything you want to.

380
00:31:57,423 --> 00:32:01,307
And thank you for continuing to uphold the values that you were elected on.

381
00:32:01,407 --> 00:32:04,830
I'm going to, you know, it's funny, I had one of my volunteers who was really talking about optics.

382
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:12,212
And we had this long discussion, because I have volunteers and I encourage, if anybody wants to volunteer with me, I have a couple of different teams.

383
00:32:12,292 --> 00:32:21,174
I have a group that meets with me before every city council meeting and we go over every item on the agenda, you know, and we, what questions should we ask of whom?

384
00:32:21,194 --> 00:32:23,335
Should we reach out to different, you know, coalition partners?

385
00:32:23,355 --> 00:32:28,556
Should we, you know, should I like reach out to the, that's why I reached out to the state auditor and asked some questions, you know.

386
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:38,272
And I get such fantastic like information and even just like community, I hear from them because they know people in different parts of the city.

387
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:40,896
So that's wonderful if anybody wants to volunteer there.

388
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:43,660
And I have another group that is helping to set up.

389
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:50,525
some listening sessions among people who typically don't come to city council, even people who typically don't vote.

390
00:32:51,286 --> 00:32:58,812
But in my opinion, doesn't matter if you own property, doesn't matter if you voted in the election, you're a valid human being.

391
00:32:58,912 --> 00:33:01,274
You are worthy of consideration in our policy platform.

392
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:06,598
And I was going somewhere with this.

393
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,439
Volunteers?

394
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,382
Yeah, one of my volunteers, oh, was talking about optics.

395
00:33:13,528 --> 00:33:14,709
And we had this whole discussion.

396
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:24,959
And at the end of the discussion, I was like, you know, the problem with being so concerned about optics is that it's like one of the elements of corruption.

397
00:33:25,179 --> 00:33:27,922
If you're so concerned about the way that you're seen,

398
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:36,617
and some attack that somebody is doing that might seem valid to people on the outside, then you're not going to genuinely uphold your values.

399
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,881
You've got to think about your values as an elected official.

400
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:43,284
I mean, I ran on things because those are genuinely my values.

401
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,801
Not because I thought it would get me to win.

402
00:33:47,142 --> 00:33:51,066
And so this question of optics is like, oh, you don't want to look bad.

403
00:33:51,426 --> 00:33:56,751
I'm a lot less concerned about looking bad than I am about being bad.

404
00:33:57,172 --> 00:34:07,581
I'm concerned that I, because of optics, might actually do something that is not my values and the values I got elected to pass policy on.

405
00:34:08,302 --> 00:34:09,283
So that, to me,

406
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:16,037
is the most important thing, is that I got elected on a values platform.

407
00:34:16,077 --> 00:34:17,138
And sure, there's details.

408
00:34:17,178 --> 00:34:19,898
I could be convinced that, oh, I should change this detail or that detail.

409
00:34:20,198 --> 00:34:22,279
There's things about the real estate transfer fee I think should be changed.

410
00:34:22,419 --> 00:34:28,140
There are things that, like listening to people, I do want to hear more and get more opinions.

411
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,581
I want to get opinions of landlords.

412
00:34:29,621 --> 00:34:30,681
I want to get opinions of renters.

413
00:34:30,701 --> 00:34:32,501
I want to get opinions of homeowners here and there.

414
00:34:34,782 --> 00:35:02,352
but I'm not going to be so concerned and that's what this is one of the goals and one of the not goals but like you know this is one of the reasons why this kind of things kind of accusation works well is because people are so worried about how they look right and to me you know in the end you look the way you vote yeah if you vote the way that you ran because that's why people elected you then you probably don't have a job and that's that's my it's what I intend to do oh hell yeah that I mean

415
00:35:04,568 --> 00:35:05,068
So yeah.

416
00:35:05,328 --> 00:35:08,590
And you know, Bailey is happily sleeping right now.

417
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,011
She's calmed by the idea.

418
00:35:11,031 --> 00:35:12,171
Yeah, exactly.

419
00:35:12,412 --> 00:35:15,133
She's calmed by the current state of the city council.

420
00:35:15,253 --> 00:35:17,074
All right.

421
00:35:17,094 --> 00:35:18,654
Well, Anna, thank you so much for being here.

422
00:35:18,714 --> 00:35:19,855
