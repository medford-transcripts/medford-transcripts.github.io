[SPEAKER_03]: She, her, coming at you from Medford.

15
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to say that because I run my own podcast, and so I always say that at the beginning of mine.

16
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:02,854
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm a city councilor.

17
00:01:02,894 --> 00:01:05,015
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a new city councilor, just got elected in November.

18
00:01:05,295 --> 00:01:05,736
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

19
00:01:05,756 --> 00:01:09,618
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do have a special co-host with us today, my niece, Bailey Jo.

20
00:01:10,098 --> 00:01:12,440
[SPEAKER_01]: is here so you may hear some baby noises in the background.

21
00:01:13,682 --> 00:01:14,402
[SPEAKER_01]: The baby podcast.

22
00:01:14,442 --> 00:01:16,544
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah the new baby podcast rebranding.

23
00:01:16,564 --> 00:01:27,455
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah so I think before we get into the to talk about City Council I'm wondering if you could answer our question for everyone which you've answered before but if you you may have some updates.

24
00:01:27,495 --> 00:01:29,998
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your favorite place to eat in Medford and what do you like to eat there?

25
00:01:30,418 --> 00:01:33,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, well it still is Oasis.

26
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Oasis is, it's close to us.

27
00:01:37,363 --> 00:01:43,047
[SPEAKER_03]: My son, who's nine, loves to go there because they have a buffet and he can pick anything he wants.

28
00:01:43,107 --> 00:01:48,271
[SPEAKER_03]: He always picks like bread and watermelon, you know, like unexciting nine-year-old things.

29
00:01:49,011 --> 00:01:50,893
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I love their fish stew.

30
00:01:50,913 --> 00:01:53,034
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably my favorite dish on the menu.

31
00:01:53,054 --> 00:01:56,697
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I, I love their buffet because I just try like everything.

32
00:01:56,737 --> 00:01:58,078
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like so amazing.

33
00:01:58,558 --> 00:02:01,419
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do really love Oasis.

34
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,460
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably my go-to.

35
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:07,061
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are a lot of wonderful, wonderful places in Medford.

36
00:02:07,121 --> 00:02:08,762
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go to Tamper a lot.

37
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:09,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yes, yes.

38
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:10,142
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

39
00:02:10,542 --> 00:02:13,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Shelley and I meet up there sometimes, for sure.

40
00:02:13,383 --> 00:02:14,484
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Oasis.

41
00:02:14,624 --> 00:02:23,327
[SPEAKER_03]: If I may, Tamper, in the wintertime, I started to go to Tamper every day, even if I wasn't going to work there, because they have their own homemade bone broth.

42
00:02:23,807 --> 00:02:26,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I did see that on the menu mug of bone broth.

43
00:02:26,628 --> 00:02:27,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.

44
00:02:27,228 --> 00:02:28,728
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thrilled.

45
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:29,528
[SPEAKER_01]: I would get it every day.

46
00:02:29,848 --> 00:02:30,128
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.

47
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:31,468
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good tip.

48
00:02:31,948 --> 00:02:32,329
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

49
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:38,030
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, so I think the last time we talked to you, you were campaigning for city council.

50
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,030
[SPEAKER_01]: And so and I know you you had a lot of important sort of values that you were running on.

51
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:48,731
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wonder and I know we also know you from incorruptible master your podcast.

52
00:02:49,151 --> 00:02:52,112
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm wondering if you could share or reflect on like kind of

53
00:02:52,612 --> 00:02:57,357
[SPEAKER_01]: How you've held on to those values sort of what you've experienced so far on the city council.

54
00:02:57,598 --> 00:02:57,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

55
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:07,448
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I have to say, the last like seven eight years of my life, I have been, I used to be a software engineer so I, you know, got.

56
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:24,024
[SPEAKER_03]: really motivated during the 2016 campaign, and I just decided to devote my life to understanding corruption in politics, which to me is like the number one problem in, you know, America, perhaps the world, right?

57
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:28,548
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, it's a very deep topic.

58
00:03:28,648 --> 00:03:31,491
[SPEAKER_03]: There are many, many ways that

59
00:03:32,932 --> 00:03:35,959
[SPEAKER_03]: people get corrupted like the minute they step into office.

60
00:03:37,262 --> 00:03:40,871
[SPEAKER_03]: But before we go into that, just to answer your question, I ran kind of

61
00:03:42,689 --> 00:03:49,353
[SPEAKER_03]: to be able to implement some of the stuff that I have been talking about for years and years, implement directly.

62
00:03:50,934 --> 00:04:07,603
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really interesting to see how the pressure that the city council is under, the really, to me, expected pressure, but which of the different kinds of pressure are very intense at Medford City Council level.

63
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:12,309
[SPEAKER_03]: and which are really not happening.

64
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:22,444
[SPEAKER_03]: Today I will be talking about, what I'm mostly going to talk about is the intense pressure that we are under, that I consider one of the classic forms of corruption in government.

65
00:04:23,115 --> 00:04:24,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Great, yeah, I would love to hear about that.

66
00:04:24,395 --> 00:04:25,276
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we've been.

67
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:26,976
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Bailey would really like to hear about it.

68
00:04:27,016 --> 00:04:29,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Bailey has a lot to say about corruption, I guess.

69
00:04:30,017 --> 00:04:47,361
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, so I think, so this is, we're recording this beginning of August, and we sort of had an interesting budget season, and I think we, like the last city council meeting that I watched was, there's like an introduction of a, I guess a motion about an audit by,

70
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:55,590
[SPEAKER_01]: Counselor scare Peli but yeah, I guess I'm interested to hear what you know what the pressure has been like how you would talk about that.

71
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:56,210
[SPEAKER_01]: How you describe it.

72
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:59,695
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, I'm gonna go ahead and dive in I

73
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:09,007
[SPEAKER_03]: I've really spent a lot of time looking at why politicians, and I want to define what I mean by corruption.

74
00:05:10,287 --> 00:05:15,451
[SPEAKER_03]: So almost every single politician, they get elected, and they run on a platform.

75
00:05:15,471 --> 00:05:16,712
[SPEAKER_03]: They say they're going to do certain things.

76
00:05:17,132 --> 00:05:25,758
[SPEAKER_03]: And then either quickly or slowly, they move away from the policies they first ran on and toward policies that favor the wealthy.

77
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:31,028
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's my, that is the way that I describe it.

78
00:05:31,229 --> 00:05:35,150
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that happens to almost every single person who is elected.

79
00:05:36,591 --> 00:05:42,054
[SPEAKER_03]: And like I said, a lot of different kinds of pressure, takes a bunch of different forms, but that is the single constant.

80
00:05:42,774 --> 00:05:54,440
[SPEAKER_03]: There was an amazing report done, and at this point it's pretty old, it's maybe almost 20 years old, but it's called the Princeton Study, and it basically looked at 20 years of bills in Congress.

81
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:06,585
[SPEAKER_03]: their likelihood of passing, and their popularity among the bottom 90% of wage earners, I think it was wage and not wealth, and the top 10% of wage earners.

82
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:16,369
[SPEAKER_03]: And their final outcome, what they got out of all the data was that the desires of the bottom 90% of people in America

83
00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:25,827
[SPEAKER_03]: have a minuscule, near zero, statistically insignificant impact on policy.

84
00:06:26,327 --> 00:06:32,231
[SPEAKER_03]: So minuscule, near zero, I think the important one is statistically insignificant.

85
00:06:32,411 --> 00:06:36,794
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't tell the difference between zero and the margin of error in the piece.

86
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, the only people who are listened to at the congressional level are the top 10% of wage earners in America.

87
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,283
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is just a fact.

88
00:06:46,943 --> 00:06:50,204
[SPEAKER_03]: So this happens at every level of government.

89
00:06:50,224 --> 00:06:52,885
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as extreme as at the congressional level.

90
00:06:54,006 --> 00:06:56,447
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is what I'm talking about in terms of,

91
00:06:57,885 --> 00:07:05,628
[SPEAKER_03]: the pressures that people are under to essentially move away from policies they ran on and move toward policies that favor people who are wealthier.

92
00:07:06,309 --> 00:07:08,830
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that happen in Medford?

93
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:18,333
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what's been so interesting is there is a group, I think there are two basic elements happening in Medford.

94
00:07:21,195 --> 00:07:32,801
[SPEAKER_03]: There's corporate lobbying happening in Medford, and there's also the essential fact that a lot of studies have talked about, about just who reaches out to city council, statistically.

95
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:40,925
[SPEAKER_03]: Who feels like it's their right and they're entitled to email, call, show up at city council meetings, and all this.

96
00:07:43,367 --> 00:07:52,260
[SPEAKER_03]: And statistically, that is people who are wealthier people more likely to own their homes, people who, you know, have more education.

97
00:07:54,383 --> 00:08:16,595
[SPEAKER_03]: study after study, that's who reaches out to the city council, which means city councils hear from those people, and they think that their constituents have those views, even though there's this gigantic swath of people who, they're too busy, it's not on their radar, for whatever reason, cultural reason, they just don't reach out, and their opinion's probably pretty different.

98
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:26,682
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think one of the bigger, I think one of the reasons I reached out to you originally was the sort of policies around housing and renting and landlords.

99
00:08:27,283 --> 00:08:37,891
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know, when you're talking about like wage earners and wealth, like I do sometimes, like I think about inherited wealth in Medford and especially in that topic about landlords.

100
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:40,033
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I wonder how that's played into all of this.

101
00:08:40,573 --> 00:08:44,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well, the corporate lobbying group that I'm talking about is the Greater Boston Real Estate Board.

102
00:08:44,675 --> 00:08:48,616
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, look, they're not from Medford.

103
00:08:49,337 --> 00:08:50,977
[SPEAKER_03]: They're outside of our city.

104
00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:52,798
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a corporate lobbying group.

105
00:08:52,818 --> 00:08:55,159
[SPEAKER_03]: They represent a lot of gigantic corporate developers.

106
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:04,443
[SPEAKER_03]: They really are very good at making small landlords who maybe only own one or two properties believe that they're on their side.

107
00:09:06,784 --> 00:09:07,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't think they are.

108
00:09:08,586 --> 00:09:10,247
[SPEAKER_03]: But they're good at making it seem like that.

109
00:09:10,787 --> 00:09:23,016
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have spent thousands of dollars sending mailers against things like the real estate transfer fee and the other housing policies that we, six out of the seven of the people on the city council, we ran on.

110
00:09:23,476 --> 00:09:25,337
[SPEAKER_03]: It was on all of our literature.

111
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:26,578
[SPEAKER_03]: It was on all of our websites.

112
00:09:27,119 --> 00:09:28,440
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about it at the doors.

113
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,620
[SPEAKER_03]: This was not hidden.

114
00:09:29,781 --> 00:09:31,122
[SPEAKER_03]: This was something everybody knew about.

115
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:35,765
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something that we won the election on, is housing policies like

116
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:37,460
[SPEAKER_03]: the real estate transfer fee.

117
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:50,570
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, there's stuff written up in the Boston Globe about how the Greater Boston Real Estate Board is spending thousands and thousands, I don't know how much, of dollars across the state to tank that piece of legislation.

118
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it is a state, it's like proposed to be a statewide policy as well, right?

119
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:54,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

120
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,015
[SPEAKER_03]: There's state enabling legislation, right?

121
00:09:57,035 --> 00:10:05,242
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's, you can pass a home rule petition at the city council level, but there's no guarantee that you can unless the state enabling legislation passes.

122
00:10:05,682 --> 00:10:13,027
[SPEAKER_03]: If the state-enabling legislation passes, because there's also that at the state level, then we would be able to pass it without a home loan petition.

123
00:10:13,107 --> 00:10:13,568
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, right, right.

124
00:10:13,948 --> 00:10:19,812
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and so you said that this lobbying group is good at making it seem like they're on the side of landlords.

125
00:10:20,713 --> 00:10:21,413
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that mean?

126
00:10:21,453 --> 00:10:26,557
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think is the understanding of these landlords in terms of their motivation?

127
00:10:27,298 --> 00:10:29,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so for example, with the real estate transfer fee,

128
00:10:33,157 --> 00:10:45,482
[SPEAKER_03]: It's couched in this like, oh, they're going to make it apply to every home and it's going to be, you know, they couch it so that no matter what we say.

129
00:10:47,359 --> 00:10:57,230
[SPEAKER_03]: The Greater Boston Real Estate Board has put forward what they think we're going to do and they're accusing us that we are going to do things that we aren't going to do and we've said publicly we're not going to do.

130
00:10:58,831 --> 00:11:04,558
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, and I'll just give the example of like the state enabling legislation was

131
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:12,988
[SPEAKER_03]: only going to apply to houses that sell for over a million dollars and only apply to the amount over a million dollars.

132
00:11:13,308 --> 00:11:20,798
[SPEAKER_03]: So like if you sell your house for a million dollars and one dollar, you would pay like 1% or 2% of one dollar.

133
00:11:23,561 --> 00:11:25,622
[SPEAKER_01]: Similar to the fair share amendment?

134
00:11:27,143 --> 00:11:27,803
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so.

135
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:32,085
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of like taxes over or like fees over a million dollars.

136
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:33,186
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, exactly.

137
00:11:33,566 --> 00:11:43,111
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but you know, people would come and we would say, hey, like, you know, we are inclined to have a limit, like a minimum.

138
00:11:44,652 --> 00:11:46,713
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were like, we don't believe you.

139
00:11:47,372 --> 00:12:04,999
[SPEAKER_03]: okay well we're like public officials saying public statements and having public things on our public websites and you know I mean they can not believe us all day long but they're not believing us because the real estate you know the greater Boston is out of town corporate lobbying group is sending all this

140
00:12:05,779 --> 00:12:09,240
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, is paying a bunch of money to influence voters.

141
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:10,420
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's.

142
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is a real thing.

143
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:18,722
[SPEAKER_03]: And they they can do it just like any corporate lobbying group, because they have the money to pay people to do this all day long.

144
00:12:18,762 --> 00:12:19,102
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

145
00:12:19,442 --> 00:12:31,365
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like it mirrors like other processes like federally and then also maybe on the city council where there is like this insistence on misinformation or like that, like and maybe there's an element of like, who do we trust?

146
00:12:31,465 --> 00:12:35,406
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I guess I wonder how you notice that or like what you think that's about.

147
00:12:36,967 --> 00:12:48,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I mean, the trust thing is very interesting because, I mean, the second part that I alluded to is who tends to reach out to city council.

148
00:12:49,074 --> 00:12:58,480
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will say it seems like there is a group of, I don't know how many people, you know, but from among that group,

149
00:12:59,449 --> 00:13:04,138
[SPEAKER_03]: They bring between 25 and 50 people to almost every city council meeting.

150
00:13:08,325 --> 00:13:28,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they are the ones that are coming up and speaking at the podium, and there are fewer people from the other side of the policy debate that are coming up and speaking at the podium, they have really accused us of not listening to the community.

151
00:13:28,621 --> 00:13:31,223
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to get into this, because this is really very, I get it that they,

152
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:45,016
[SPEAKER_03]: that they may genuinely somehow believe that they are the majority opinion.

153
00:13:45,276 --> 00:13:47,919
[SPEAKER_03]: I think some of them genuinely, and I have empathy, I do.

154
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,141
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think these are bad people.

155
00:13:51,322 --> 00:13:55,046
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that their viewpoint on policy is totally valid.

156
00:13:55,506 --> 00:13:57,848
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not mine, and it's not what I got elected to do.

157
00:13:59,189 --> 00:13:59,929
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not what I ran on.

158
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:03,310
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to do the things that I ran on because that's why I got elected.

159
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:04,891
[SPEAKER_03]: I got elected on a policy.

160
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,792
[SPEAKER_03]: I ran as a policy person.

161
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:09,873
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like to talk about my background or who I am that much.

162
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:11,153
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to run on policy.

163
00:14:12,493 --> 00:14:15,674
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to do the things I got elected to do because that's why people elected me.

164
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:26,398
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is, to me, not helpful when people come

165
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:31,945
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they say is, you're not listening to the community.

166
00:14:32,486 --> 00:14:36,150
[SPEAKER_03]: Because 25 people have gotten up and spoken in one direction.

167
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,754
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I say people don't come on the other side, that's not really true.

168
00:14:39,794 --> 00:14:43,318
[SPEAKER_03]: They're often 10, 15, 20 people speaking in the other direction.

169
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,142
[SPEAKER_03]: But the loudest voices,

170
00:14:48,069 --> 00:14:50,390
[SPEAKER_03]: are the ones from this particular group.

171
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,331
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm, you know, if any of those people are listening to this podcast, which, you know, very likely they are not.

172
00:14:55,911 --> 00:15:02,493
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really geared toward that particular, you know, policy group of people.

173
00:15:03,533 --> 00:15:08,815
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to lay out, I want to at least explain

174
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:16,950
[SPEAKER_03]: why we are continuing to vote for the policies that we ran on in a way that hopefully people can understand.

175
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:23,455
[SPEAKER_03]: I want you to imagine that you

176
00:15:25,013 --> 00:15:28,897
[SPEAKER_03]: voted for certain people to get elected to your city council.

177
00:15:29,858 --> 00:15:35,623
[SPEAKER_03]: And hypothetically, yes, hypothetically, you voted to elect certain people to your city council.

178
00:15:36,104 --> 00:15:41,809
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was an election in which it wasn't, this was really a policy election.

179
00:15:42,050 --> 00:15:44,492
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no question, it wasn't just a policy election.

180
00:15:44,812 --> 00:15:46,914
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't just that everybody had clear policies on there.

181
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:54,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Like websites on their literature it was also that this was kind of a binary election because.

182
00:15:54,985 --> 00:15:58,211
[SPEAKER_03]: The 6 of us who got elected.

183
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:05,557
[SPEAKER_03]: We had literature that put all of our policies on one side and all of our names and pictures on the other side.

184
00:16:06,158 --> 00:16:16,005
[SPEAKER_03]: So this wasn't like 12 people all running on different independent platforms, and then it just so happens that five or six of them tend to vote together.

185
00:16:16,246 --> 00:16:20,249
[SPEAKER_03]: This was literally, you're voting for a set of policies.

186
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:22,510
[SPEAKER_03]: You're voting for those policies.

187
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:23,811
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the way that it was.

188
00:16:24,832 --> 00:16:27,694
[SPEAKER_03]: And we didn't win three seats out of seven.

189
00:16:27,974 --> 00:16:29,515
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't win four seats out of seven.

190
00:16:29,895 --> 00:16:31,716
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't win five seats out of seven.

191
00:16:32,276 --> 00:16:33,897
[SPEAKER_03]: We won six seats out of seven.

192
00:16:33,997 --> 00:16:34,558
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what?

193
00:16:34,838 --> 00:16:37,980
[SPEAKER_03]: The runner-up was also on our policy platform.

194
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:44,183
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there is no greater political mandate than that.

195
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,405
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a mandate.

196
00:16:46,725 --> 00:16:53,789
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason that the people who support what we're doing aren't showing up to the city council is because why on earth should they show up?

197
00:16:54,389 --> 00:16:55,990
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave us a freaking mandate.

198
00:16:56,530 --> 00:17:02,553
[SPEAKER_03]: They worked hard to make sure we were elected to do the things we said we would do.

199
00:17:02,973 --> 00:17:15,098
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want people on the other side to imagine, if you voted somebody into office on a policy platform, and then suddenly they weren't voting that way, you would be pissed.

200
00:17:15,899 --> 00:17:17,159
[SPEAKER_03]: You would be pissed.

201
00:17:17,259 --> 00:17:18,620
[SPEAKER_03]: You would be like, corruption.

202
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,141
[SPEAKER_03]: And you would be right.

203
00:17:20,761 --> 00:17:21,421
[SPEAKER_03]: You would be right.

204
00:17:23,661 --> 00:17:31,903
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one classic and very normal and natural human nature form of corruption.

205
00:17:32,783 --> 00:17:39,164
[SPEAKER_03]: When a bunch of people show up and they're angry and they're accusing you, you don't want to stand up to them.

206
00:17:39,344 --> 00:17:40,044
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard.

207
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:42,645
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to be kind of brave.

208
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:46,506
[SPEAKER_03]: It's deeply unpleasant, deeply unpleasant.

209
00:17:47,809 --> 00:18:01,856
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, one of the statements I was struck by in that meeting about the proposal for the audit was Kit Collins talking about division, right?

210
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:07,839
[SPEAKER_01]: And when someone's trying to convince you that you're being divided, that's sort of the most divisive tactic.

211
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,821
[SPEAKER_01]: That was very spot on.

212
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:15,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I can't imagine it's comfortable to be in those meetings.

213
00:18:16,664 --> 00:18:22,051
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I don't know what my question is, but I feel like that's got to be hard.

214
00:18:22,071 --> 00:18:28,039
[SPEAKER_03]: I am so glad that you mentioned this, actually, because I do want to talk a little bit about culture.

215
00:18:28,059 --> 00:18:31,364
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a cultural change happening on the State Council.

216
00:18:32,764 --> 00:18:35,386
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, for one, think it's an incredibly healthy change.

217
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:39,910
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was not following the Medford City Council eight or 10 years ago.

218
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:47,196
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I've heard from people is that it was very common for city councilors to get up and just angry rant.

219
00:18:48,277 --> 00:18:54,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Angry rant at the mayor, angry rant at something that happened, angry rant about a business that is or is not doing whatever.

220
00:18:56,523 --> 00:19:02,028
[SPEAKER_03]: And that people felt like their city councilor was doing their job if they were standing up and angry ranting.

221
00:19:02,568 --> 00:19:07,273
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and look, it's not my style.

222
00:19:07,353 --> 00:19:07,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I don't know.

223
00:19:07,933 --> 00:19:11,677
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little more of my style, I guess, than like some of the other people on the city council.

224
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:14,120
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I will say Kit, bless her heart.

225
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,122
[SPEAKER_03]: She is the most calm.

226
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:18,604
[SPEAKER_03]: She's so level-headed.

227
00:19:18,664 --> 00:19:19,225
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.

228
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:21,547
[SPEAKER_03]: I can get a little fiery sometimes.

229
00:19:21,587 --> 00:19:22,228
[SPEAKER_01]: How you wouldn't.

230
00:19:23,469 --> 00:19:25,671
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway.

231
00:19:28,264 --> 00:19:36,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to talk a little bit about the way that angry ranting affects

232
00:19:38,948 --> 00:19:44,870
[SPEAKER_03]: a body, you know, I've been involved in so many groups, right?

233
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:55,953
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter whether it's like an activist group doing like issue politics or electoral politics, or if it's, you know, I've lived in a ton of like intentional communities where like you meet every month just to figure out like who's doing their chores, you know?

234
00:19:56,013 --> 00:20:06,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, like, and every group that I have been involved in has explicitly had some kind of basic guideline that says,

235
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:11,788
[SPEAKER_03]: assume good intent and don't use accusational language.

236
00:20:12,269 --> 00:20:12,429
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?

237
00:20:12,469 --> 00:20:14,331
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basic.

238
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:17,833
[SPEAKER_03]: That is basic to having a healthy group.

239
00:20:18,434 --> 00:20:25,820
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as you start lashing out with wild accusations that other people are liars and they're, you know, whatever, whatever.

240
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:30,624
[SPEAKER_03]: It is really, really unhealthy.

241
00:20:30,644 --> 00:20:31,705
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know,

242
00:20:34,503 --> 00:20:48,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to, I can't help but comment that it is not uncommon for people who use intimidation, fear-mongering, accusation, and these other kinds of tactics to project.

243
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:52,469
[SPEAKER_03]: To accuse other people of doing what they themselves are doing.

244
00:20:53,650 --> 00:21:03,053
[SPEAKER_03]: And I gotta say, I think that the division in our community is being created by fear-mongering,

245
00:21:04,229 --> 00:21:05,183
[SPEAKER_03]: misinformation.

246
00:21:06,308 --> 00:21:13,930
[SPEAKER_03]: angry ranting, accusational language, assuming worst intent, you know, these are not healthy.

247
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,311
[SPEAKER_03]: They are not healthy for any group.

248
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:18,151
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter if it's like inside of your family.

249
00:21:18,171 --> 00:21:26,733
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, imagine, you're in your family, you know, and you're, you know, one of your parents is accusing the other parent of like being a liar and a, you know, horrible person or whatever.

250
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:30,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that is not, everybody knows that is not healthy.

251
00:21:30,094 --> 00:21:34,375
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not any healthier in a city council or in an organizing group

252
00:21:34,815 --> 00:21:36,456
[SPEAKER_03]: or really in any group.

253
00:21:36,676 --> 00:21:39,158
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not healthy behavior.

254
00:21:39,658 --> 00:21:44,020
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope, I hope, and I'm happy to disagree with people.

255
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, I have empathy.

256
00:21:46,702 --> 00:21:55,426
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a lot of empathy for people who, you know, their policies were the policies done in Medford.

257
00:21:55,446 --> 00:21:59,749
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that was because in the past, it was the majority opinion.

258
00:22:00,756 --> 00:22:02,637
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's great, that's how it should be.

259
00:22:03,077 --> 00:22:09,280
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, the city councils tend to lag behind the residents in the policy making, right?

260
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,922
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that actually the majority opinion changed a long time ago.

261
00:22:13,882 --> 00:22:24,687
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's only now that the city council has caught up to the majority opinion in Medford about policy, about housing policy, about environmental policy, about inclusion policy, about like just about, you name it.

262
00:22:25,327 --> 00:22:26,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Like these things,

263
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:39,805
[SPEAKER_03]: We, I mean like the six of us who ran, you know, on similar policy platforms, our policy platforms are unquestionably the majority opinion in that.

264
00:22:40,606 --> 00:22:42,146
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that because of the election, right?

265
00:22:42,166 --> 00:22:45,147
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, there's no like wondering, right?

266
00:22:48,046 --> 00:22:56,714
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want to say, I have empathy for the people who used to have, who probably genuinely think that they're in the majority.

267
00:22:56,754 --> 00:22:58,275
[SPEAKER_03]: They genuinely just can't believe.

268
00:22:58,296 --> 00:22:59,637
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard for them to believe.

269
00:22:59,737 --> 00:23:00,317
[SPEAKER_03]: I get that.

270
00:23:00,417 --> 00:23:07,364
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not, you know, I don't have any disrespect for them having different policy opinions from me.

271
00:23:08,505 --> 00:23:13,049
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't even have disrespect for them in their feelings of loss and anger.

272
00:23:16,358 --> 00:23:21,142
[SPEAKER_03]: It ain't healthy to lash out and wildly accuse people in the middle of public.

273
00:23:21,202 --> 00:23:23,224
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not healthy.

274
00:23:23,464 --> 00:23:23,964
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not good.

275
00:23:23,984 --> 00:23:25,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not a good look.

276
00:23:25,706 --> 00:23:25,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

277
00:23:26,426 --> 00:23:33,172
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what you're speaking to is that perhaps some people have a sense of losing something.

278
00:23:33,212 --> 00:23:38,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Something's being taken away from them, given to other people, which maybe doesn't reflect the reality.

279
00:23:38,636 --> 00:23:42,700
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there is more of a push towards maybe more people getting what they need.

280
00:23:45,097 --> 00:23:57,848
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think, and I think that behavior when it's on such a sort of, well, mostly public like display is not a great look like for those people, but also I think the model behavior of the rest of the city council, right?

281
00:23:57,868 --> 00:24:03,753
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I think even the last group of city councilors, there were some that would shout back at people that were speaking, right?

282
00:24:03,773 --> 00:24:09,659
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, and sometimes there wasn't like a shutting down of folks who were speaking disrespectfully to city councilors.

283
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,881
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think it is like,

284
00:24:12,975 --> 00:24:21,962
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit calmer in some ways, but I think you're hitting a good point there about just sort of the decorum in those meetings sometimes.

285
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,263
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

286
00:24:23,823 --> 00:24:24,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

287
00:24:24,324 --> 00:24:27,366
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to encourage folks listening.

288
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:37,514
[SPEAKER_03]: And unfortunately, it has also become really uncomfortable for people who agree with our policy platform to show up because

289
00:24:38,174 --> 00:24:46,898
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, people will interrupt, people will accuse, people will, you know, like, you're literally going to get attacked if you come and speak.

290
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:49,999
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is very unfortunate.

291
00:24:50,059 --> 00:24:51,780
[SPEAKER_03]: That is very unhealthy for the community, I think.

292
00:24:52,120 --> 00:25:04,106
[SPEAKER_03]: But if there are some brave souls out there listening to this, I really want to encourage people to come and say, just say the sort of essential basic reality, which is I'm

293
00:25:08,905 --> 00:25:13,951
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you guys can understand that you're not the majority opinion in Medford anymore.

294
00:25:15,133 --> 00:25:16,234
[SPEAKER_03]: The election proved that.

295
00:25:17,836 --> 00:25:22,823
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to disagree with you on policy, but you've got to accept.

296
00:25:22,843 --> 00:25:25,125
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to accept you're not the majority anymore.

297
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:26,647
[SPEAKER_03]: We're the majority.

298
00:25:28,305 --> 00:25:39,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think, too, particularly in the housing conversation, I could call to mind several people that I know have lived in Medford for generations whose housing is at risk, like my own neighbors.

299
00:25:39,532 --> 00:25:47,377
[SPEAKER_01]: So when older family members pass away and there's not a plan for how to keep your home, they will directly benefit from some of these policies.

300
00:25:47,837 --> 00:25:51,900
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think there's an open-mindedness that's maybe missing.

301
00:25:53,441 --> 00:26:03,604
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah also I would totally I have a podcast about this and I think it's scary to go to I've never been to I don't think an in person city council meeting I participated over zoom but even that is scary.

302
00:26:04,165 --> 00:26:11,727
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're right like I think it is especially for the you know when we started this conversation those folks that may be more marginalized or more like.

303
00:26:12,167 --> 00:26:17,429
[SPEAKER_01]: vulnerable, the thought of speaking to an angry mob, that's not easy.

304
00:26:18,069 --> 00:26:21,431
[SPEAKER_01]: I do find emailing you all to be helpful as well.

305
00:26:21,451 --> 00:26:22,571
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you mentioned that.

306
00:26:22,591 --> 00:26:30,154
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why it was going to be my tip, which is you can email and have your comments read at the meeting.

307
00:26:30,414 --> 00:26:31,355
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to be there.

308
00:26:31,595 --> 00:26:32,235
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to show up on

309
00:26:32,335 --> 00:26:33,416
[SPEAKER_03]: You can also show up on Zoom.

310
00:26:33,577 --> 00:26:34,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Zoom is a little easier.

311
00:26:35,739 --> 00:26:39,725
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'll be able to speak and you're comfortably sitting in your room.

312
00:26:40,405 --> 00:26:45,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, wow, I'll tell you, these people are like, you should prioritize us and not those people on Zoom.

313
00:26:46,393 --> 00:26:48,896
[SPEAKER_03]: They are like, you know.

314
00:26:49,757 --> 00:27:02,430
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, okay, yeah, you know take out the time to yeah, you know, they took the time to show up at the ballot box and It's not like there weren't other people running.

315
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:02,970
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

316
00:27:03,451 --> 00:27:05,533
[SPEAKER_01]: There were other people right exactly, right?

317
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:07,074
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and also I mean

318
00:27:07,875 --> 00:27:10,657
[SPEAKER_01]: taking the time to show up at a meeting isn't just about the time, right?

319
00:27:10,697 --> 00:27:14,259
[SPEAKER_01]: People have like kids, they have like, you know, they can't always leave the house.

320
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:21,364
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do think the Zoom option does make it way more accessible and, you know, still a little scary, but yeah.

321
00:27:21,504 --> 00:27:25,266
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, send them in over email and, you know, have them read by somebody who's already there.

322
00:27:25,487 --> 00:27:27,268
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's a great way.

323
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:29,309
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you could do that every week.

324
00:27:30,109 --> 00:27:31,050
[SPEAKER_03]: Send something in.

325
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:31,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

326
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:35,233
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, pick anything on the agenda and then throw in the comment about like,

327
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:40,191
[SPEAKER_03]: please city councilors do what you ran on.

328
00:27:40,691 --> 00:27:41,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Do your policy platform.

329
00:27:42,072 --> 00:27:46,355
[SPEAKER_03]: Please do pro-housing, pro-environment, because you have a mandate.

330
00:27:47,075 --> 00:27:53,440
[SPEAKER_03]: The more people who comment on anything and at the bottom say, city councilors, I expect you to do what we voted you in to do.

331
00:27:54,797 --> 00:28:00,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I think we have focused a lot on the loud, the self-perceived majority.

332
00:28:00,819 --> 00:28:09,842
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some coalitions and community groups in Medford that are maybe more aligned with the work you're doing, like Safe Medford, like Housing Medford.

333
00:28:10,383 --> 00:28:19,846
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I wonder, are there groups that folks could connect with in order to feel a little bit more able to participate or support your work?

334
00:28:20,206 --> 00:28:24,089
[SPEAKER_03]: It is always great to join these volunteer organizations.

335
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:29,132
[SPEAKER_03]: The stronger they are, the more the city is able to do.

336
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:33,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Trees Medford, I'm such a big trees person.

337
00:28:33,635 --> 00:28:35,236
[SPEAKER_03]: So Trees Medford is a wonderful group.

338
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:36,257
[SPEAKER_03]: They're all fantastic.

339
00:28:36,337 --> 00:28:42,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Safe Medford, those folks, man, when there's certain issues come up, they are there.

340
00:28:42,581 --> 00:28:43,461
[SPEAKER_03]: They know everything.

341
00:28:43,481 --> 00:28:44,902
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so informed.

342
00:28:45,022 --> 00:28:46,543
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the whole history of everything.

343
00:28:46,563 --> 00:28:47,484
[SPEAKER_03]: They're fantastic.

344
00:28:49,105 --> 00:28:53,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Housing Medford is a wonderful fantastic group doing a lot of like research all these groups.

345
00:28:53,247 --> 00:28:55,889
[SPEAKER_03]: They do a ton of research I mean, they're really amazing.

346
00:28:55,989 --> 00:29:10,397
[SPEAKER_03]: So I absolutely encourage people to get involved in the volunteer groups because they you know, they are They're doing a lot of the work that enables for policies to change and for and for reality to change, right?

347
00:29:10,417 --> 00:29:11,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean not everything

348
00:29:11,978 --> 00:29:13,579
[SPEAKER_03]: that needs to change is a policy.

349
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:21,006
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some things that just, you know, we got to change things in our city and some volunteering will make it happen.

350
00:29:21,606 --> 00:29:26,210
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm on the Charter Review Committee, Charter Study Commission.

351
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:31,515
[SPEAKER_01]: We're almost wrapping up our work, but I feel like that would not have happened without the work of volunteers trying to get that done for so long.

352
00:29:31,555 --> 00:29:34,297
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, and I do think, I always think about like,

353
00:29:35,603 --> 00:29:38,185
[SPEAKER_01]: Medford has a lot of really invested people, right?

354
00:29:38,205 --> 00:29:45,890
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not always saying the things that you want to hear, but there's a lot of energy towards making our city a place that people like and enjoy.

355
00:29:46,711 --> 00:29:47,091
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

356
00:29:47,351 --> 00:29:47,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.

357
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, anything else for today?

358
00:29:49,693 --> 00:29:51,154
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else you want to wrap up with?

359
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:55,277
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think that's it for me.

360
00:29:55,597 --> 00:29:57,678
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have come here and talked about a policy.

361
00:29:57,778 --> 00:29:58,599
[SPEAKER_03]: I could have come here, whatever.

362
00:29:58,639 --> 00:30:04,583
[SPEAKER_03]: But the reality is that the pressure at the city council is so

363
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:35,500
[SPEAKER_03]: ugly it is so difficult and it makes it very difficult for us to do our jobs because like often this group of people will come and they will each speak for five minutes three times I think we've cut it down to three now but you know we would be up past one in the morning like yeah many many many meetings yeah up past one in the morning and you know it's just really hard for us to do our jobs and I will I will comment like we have a really great

364
00:30:37,606 --> 00:30:43,689
[SPEAKER_03]: We have really great rules around people speaking at the public comment period during city council.

365
00:30:45,169 --> 00:30:52,753
[SPEAKER_03]: It is unfortunate that it is almost exclusively being used by this one group of people and not by the rest of the community.

366
00:30:52,773 --> 00:31:03,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Because in surrounding cities, I tell you, and in other cities, like I've worked with cities across city councils and city councilors and mayors across the country, it is very normal for there to be one public comment period.

367
00:31:03,459 --> 00:31:04,319
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens at the beginning.

368
00:31:04,859 --> 00:31:05,620
[SPEAKER_03]: You get two minutes.

369
00:31:07,742 --> 00:31:11,527
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're done, you go home because there's no more public comment for the rest of the meeting.

370
00:31:12,107 --> 00:31:18,776
[SPEAKER_03]: We allow people to speak on every agenda item for three minutes each, sometimes multiple times.

371
00:31:18,816 --> 00:31:23,663
[SPEAKER_03]: We have an unbelievably robust ability for people to come out.

372
00:31:24,443 --> 00:31:26,544
[SPEAKER_03]: speak their minds on issues.

373
00:31:27,505 --> 00:31:29,446
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's a good thing, right?

374
00:31:30,066 --> 00:31:36,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I just, I hope that it becomes less, the more accusational it is, the more likely it's going to be ratcheted down.

375
00:31:38,171 --> 00:31:43,994
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope that it becomes something that people want to use and want to come and

376
00:31:45,393 --> 00:31:47,255
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, let us know their opinions about things.

377
00:31:47,275 --> 00:31:48,776
[SPEAKER_03]: So I encourage people to come.

378
00:31:50,097 --> 00:31:53,900
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, come and speak on things that are maybe less controversial.

379
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,303
[SPEAKER_03]: You can say your piece, you can talk about really anything you want to.

380
00:31:57,423 --> 00:32:01,307
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for continuing to uphold the values that you were elected on.

381
00:32:01,407 --> 00:32:04,830
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to, you know, it's funny, I had one of my volunteers who was really talking about optics.

382
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:12,212
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had this long discussion, because I have volunteers and I encourage, if anybody wants to volunteer with me, I have a couple of different teams.

383
00:32:12,292 --> 00:32:21,174
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a group that meets with me before every city council meeting and we go over every item on the agenda, you know, and we, what questions should we ask of whom?

384
00:32:21,194 --> 00:32:23,335
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we reach out to different, you know, coalition partners?

385
00:32:23,355 --> 00:32:28,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we, you know, should I like reach out to the, that's why I reached out to the state auditor and asked some questions, you know.

386
00:32:29,359 --> 00:32:38,272
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get such fantastic like information and even just like community, I hear from them because they know people in different parts of the city.

387
00:32:38,893 --> 00:32:40,896
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's wonderful if anybody wants to volunteer there.

388
00:32:40,916 --> 00:32:43,660
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have another group that is helping to set up.

389
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:50,525
[SPEAKER_03]: some listening sessions among people who typically don't come to city council, even people who typically don't vote.

390
00:32:51,286 --> 00:32:58,812
[SPEAKER_03]: But in my opinion, doesn't matter if you own property, doesn't matter if you voted in the election, you're a valid human being.

391
00:32:58,912 --> 00:33:01,274
[SPEAKER_03]: You are worthy of consideration in our policy platform.

392
00:33:04,396 --> 00:33:06,598
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was going somewhere with this.

393
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:08,439
[SPEAKER_03]: Volunteers?

394
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, one of my volunteers, oh, was talking about optics.

395
00:33:13,528 --> 00:33:14,709
[SPEAKER_03]: And we had this whole discussion.

396
00:33:14,729 --> 00:33:24,959
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the end of the discussion, I was like, you know, the problem with being so concerned about optics is that it's like one of the elements of corruption.

397
00:33:25,179 --> 00:33:27,922
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're so concerned about the way that you're seen,

398
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:36,617
[SPEAKER_03]: and some attack that somebody is doing that might seem valid to people on the outside, then you're not going to genuinely uphold your values.

399
00:33:37,098 --> 00:33:39,881
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to think about your values as an elected official.

400
00:33:39,901 --> 00:33:43,284
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I ran on things because those are genuinely my values.

401
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:45,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Not because I thought it would get me to win.

402
00:33:47,142 --> 00:33:51,066
[SPEAKER_03]: And so this question of optics is like, oh, you don't want to look bad.

403
00:33:51,426 --> 00:33:56,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a lot less concerned about looking bad than I am about being bad.

404
00:33:57,172 --> 00:34:07,581
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm concerned that I, because of optics, might actually do something that is not my values and the values I got elected to pass policy on.

405
00:34:08,302 --> 00:34:09,283
[SPEAKER_03]: So that, to me,

406
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:16,037
[SPEAKER_03]: is the most important thing, is that I got elected on a values platform.

407
00:34:16,077 --> 00:34:17,138
[SPEAKER_03]: And sure, there's details.

408
00:34:17,178 --> 00:34:19,898
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be convinced that, oh, I should change this detail or that detail.

409
00:34:20,198 --> 00:34:22,279
